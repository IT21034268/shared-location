1,Poor excuse for a literary work,"Not only does the hate filled nature of this book suck, so does the writing style.Kitty, go back to your box and dig deeper!!!!!"
1,Questionable Timing - Commercially Exploitable,"Kitty Kelly has published of book filled with gossip, trash, inuendoes, and full of unnamed and questionable sources. This is National Enquirer material, and not a serious non-fiction book on the Bush Family. Miss Kelly should have the gutts to name her sources and confirm the documents she references as ""genuine"", not fabricated material or sources. This is just a commercial vehicle with a very questionable timing release. The book belongs in the circular file. Its another hachet job on people she dislikes and will not sue her for slander, so she is home free. SHAME< SHAME< SHAME."
1,Oh please!,"Trash. Don't waste your time or money - read the National Enquirer on line in the grocery store (probably more accurate, too)."
1,"One more order of TRIPE, hold the facts!","Who would even think of buying a book from an author that specializes in ""exposes"". Regretfully, I had read parts of this authors expose on Englands Royal Family while waiting for a dentist appointment. It was a relief to be called to the dentists chair. You know when you see her name on the cover, the book will contain ""dirt"" garnered from many dubious sources, some of which publically refute the words which the author has coming from their mouths. People that rely on such as this for their information and education deserve what they get."
5,"Power corrupts, and absolute power is even better...","A thorough and well-written glimpse into an American dynasty. Those who choose to believe ""W"" when he says he received ""no special treatment"" will be offended by this book. Those looking for insight into exactly how wealth and political access are routinely traded for power, public policy and personal advantage will find this book instructional and thought-provoking."
2,Good Goosip but Nothing More4,Found this book in the laundry room of my building so at least I know I never would have bought it. The real brains behind George is mostly cunning Karl Rove who is not mentioned enough. I think Bush 41 was the better of the two but I voted for neither . Barbara never seemed to me some benign grandmotherly figure with her ever present pearls. I always found her sort of terrifying with a frightening glint in her eyes. I always liked Laura who was very intelligent & just kept a low profile in the White House. Smart of her!At least George never disgraced his family like Clinton did so give him credit for that. I think he would have been just as happy if he didn't get elected. I also like the fact that since out of office he refrains from presidential criticism.The right wing Christian evangelists would forgive a serial killer if he said he had found Jesus. They have really destroyed the Republican party.
2,"Political, kind of boring","I bought this because it was Kitty Kelly and I usually enjoy her work. However, for me, and this is an entirely personal opinion, it was pretty boring. It was very political. Now, I KNOW that's what the Bushes ARE, but reading about politics just isn't my cup of tea. I just thought it would be more gossipy, like say, The Royals by the same author, which I enjoyed. If you like political reading, I'm sure this book would be good judging from the other reviews."
4,good but I've read better,"While this book is very controversial, none of the allegations are new. I thought it would be more reveling. I would recommend Russell Bowen's Immaculate Deception - The Real Story of the Bush Crime Family ahead of this book. Bowens book was written a long time ago and not during a critical election. I also think that his research was better. At least Ms. Kelley has the courage to turn over the rock, and attempt to bring to the public light, some of the corruption and evil that has surrounded the Bush family since prior to WW2."
5,Thought,"Hooray for Kitty Kelley! Readers shocked by this biography-memoir are those who are loyal Republicans - and blind. We are in dire need of knowing all about this family, like it or not. Thousands of us have been laid off, paying for a questionable war. I am sorry that some reviewers take issue with this book but it is in the American spirit to criticize. Criticism is the American way. The Republicans are not god and neither are the rest of us. We need a president who can balance a budget and reveal the daily doings of what he does in office. America is a pluralistic society; it is neither Christian nor Republican nor Democrat. In an election, thanks to Kitty Kelley, we must judge the leader - good and bad sides. No one who runs for the highest office in the land is above judgement."
1,Too Curious To Leave It Unread....,"I feel like some of those other reviewers who ""need a bath"" after reading this book. I wished now that I had not read this filth. I do worry that undecided voters will vote for Kerry because of this baseless story. Where's the proof that anything's true? Please, folks, don't be stupid. Our safety is at stake."
1,The Family is a 700 page tabloid,"Chris Matthews (Hardball MSNBC) grilled Kitty Kelley on her sources and exposed her baseless conclusions.Chris - ""were you able to get anyone to come forward and go on record as saying that George W Bush did anything illegal.""Her reply, without hesitation, was ""No."" If Laura and the president did what Kitty surmises surely somebody would say, ""Yeah I was there."" If her premise was at all true you would think that she could get at least one for 700 pages of nameless assertions. She has no credibility in my book."
2,"Overdone, Overwrought , Unsourced Bush-Bashing..","First, simply stated, it's clear that GW Bush is among the very worst presidents in US History. His lack of intellect, and with the total incompetence of this administration are obvious to anyone who knows how 2 think! The Iraq disaster is the crowning mess, and we'll be paying for it for at least a generation. Not to mention the deceit in starting this now infamous Shock and Awe Bombing/ War! Unfortunately ,Kitty rehaeshes every rumor about his schoolboy (and beyond) past. The final result is mostly a hack job. She could and should have done a lot better! w"
1,Gives 60 Minutes II a run for their money,"Not one allegation in the book is verified - not one. I read this in the library for no cost, and I still paid too much.Maybe she will soon ""discover"" some memos from a guy that's been dead for 20 years, and be able to ""prove"" one or two of her allegations.Save your money and buy a comic book."
2,Wow,"It looks like reviews are lining up here according to political affiliation. I should have guessed!As for Ms. Kelly's writing, as with her other books, these are written in a gossipy way. No, she's not a particularly talented writer. She goes for the shocking ""unauthorized"" biographies. Fortunately for her, I go for the ""shocking"" unauthorized gossip. (That's why I read the National Enquirer while standing in the checkout line of a supermarket.)I find this book as easy to dismiss as I did the Frank Sinatra book, The Royal Family book, and all the others that Ms. Kelly has written. The political outrage over this book is only bringing more attention to a hack writer. Unless you are into dirty gossip, this book isn't really worth your time."
2,Season of Lies,"Kitty Kelley's indictment of the Bush bunch is undoubtedly filled with half-truths and even a few outright lies among a few likely sordid events from the lives of the Bush clan.However, since half-truths and lies are the modus operandi of George W. Bush's presidency, it's hard to get angry at Kelley. Her distortions will make her a lot of money and get her on the talk-show circuit; Bush's distortions have resulted in an unjust war, the proliferation of terrorism, and America's alienation from most of the world.So, whether you read the book or not, get rid of Bush on November 2, and then we can forget about him and the book."
2,Entitled to Read This Book,"Who are the Bushes, where did they come from, and how did they get to power? These questions are interesting and covered in detail. They are a family who are very male-dominated and in great need of validating their masculinity. They feel a deep sense of entitlement and don't deal well with criticism. They are a family that are masters of denial. This is interesteing to read, but is there truly anyone who is even vaguely political who doesn't know these things? As a life-long democrat, it is fun to read books that bash those who I find lacking, but this is the best thing about the book. Many of the specific accusations are pure gossip - their accuracy is up for grabs, just like any gossip. This is one book I really do not recommend."
1,Editors Are Paid To Edit,This is MAX a 350 page story + photos. The Bushes just do not warrant so much ink and paper.The back and forth/repetition made me nuts.My first and last reading of a KK tome.
2,Typical Kitty Kelley,"I've read other books by this author, and wasn't particularly impressed by her writing, though I found them entertaining, gossipy and unchallenging. It's difficult to tell what is fact and what is bias, though many of the statements she makes here have been previously alleged by some credible journalists. Great writing this is not, but it is an interesting read given the subject matter. If it weren't January in California, I'd characterize this as a good beach book. I doubt I'd want to pay full price for this, though, given the price of books these days."
5,"YAAAAY!!! What's ""fair"" is ""fair,"" people!","In light of all the blatant lying scumbags who've crawled out from under various rocks to smear John Kerry (""Swift Boat Veterans For Truth"" and other rightwing media darlings), we the people of this great country desperately deserve to have some balance...in the form of this controversial but mostly well-researched book from Kitty Kelley!Until the left gets its own Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Wall Street Journal editorial page, Faux News Channel, assorted AM talk radio Certified Nimrods, Matt Drudge, Washington Times, etc.---it will be up to people like Kitty Kelley and Michael Moore to even out the scales...and more power to them!!!At present the extreme right in this country enjoys a lopsided media advantage and is used to dishing it out without getting much thrown back in its face. Viva Kelley!"
3,Read this and put it in context,This is a pretty rough book from someone who is in the business of writing rough books but I have to take these charges and put them in the context of other charges against Mr. Bush and come to the conclusion that there is a lot of truth here - especialy concerning drug use.
4,It's About Time,"It's about time someone told the truth about the Bush Crime Family. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because Kelly didn't go far enough. There is plenty of evidence that links the Bush family to the international drug trade, and child prostitution. If I were Kelly, I would definitely watch my back. You Go Girl!"
1,The author must be a Demacrat,"I would rate this book a zero star! This book is very biased and politically timed to try to tear this country apart. Very, much the same way the Ku Klux Klan worked there propaganda. Kitty Kelly? you have any Klan members in your family closet????Kitty Kelley, you should do a book on yourself. Point that high powered reporting at your life. The Bush Family have earned all they have gotten. What, would you do, if your father was President? Or if your son? If you have a son.I doubt your book, will help the other party. But, you will make money and have made it, already. Thats the bottom line. Your are in it for the money. LOL Its funny, you slam the rich, but while your doing the slamming. You my dear are making money!!!!!alot of it, being Number 1 on Amozon.com.But, Tabloids are Number 1 at Walmart too."
1,Scandal Sheet Fiction,"This book is filled with unproven assertions and based on ""sources"" that are most likely either total fabrications or partisan democrats. Let's hold this book to the same standard as ""Unfit for Command"".Let's have her prove her assertions before accepting them.It is obvious the the partisan press liberal press will never challenge this, however, because it might help Bush."
1,The latest from the smut peddler of biographers,"What is my problem with Kitty Kelly's work? Well, her work is fashioned as biography, but it is really historical fiction, unsupported or substantiated by fact. She simply picks a target, pulls out the same old bag of tricks, and goes after them. And it is always the same thing. This book is not a work of scholarship and should not be regarded as in any way factual. Intead, check out Scweizer's The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty. This book would appeal to readers of romance novels or the National Inquirer, but it does not belong on the bookshelf of someone trying to study history."
1,"A sad, deliberate attempt to profit from lies.","""I categorically deny that I ever told Kitty Kelley that George W. Bush usedcocaine at Camp David or that I ever saw him use cocaine at Camp David,""ex-Bush sister-in-law Sharon Bush said in a statement issued Thursday.That should prove that the book is a fraud. Kelley has descended to the level of the National Enquirer and the DNC in this book. It is not based on any fact, but will surely get partisan tongues on the left wagging in their headlong rush to dump Bush."
1,where is the beef?,if a person makes a statement then that person should have names for whom they are slandering or they should pay the consequences. the book is full of acusations with no beef to substanuate the facts that are here.these are merely fabrications of the author's imagination. this is nothing more than a tabloid and one should not take this as nothing more than fiction.
4,"3"" Wobble Extension","It's a wobble extension... When you know you need one, you just go ahead and get it.Seem to be pretty well made. If you don't have a Harbor Freight near your house, getting it here makes sense. Do keep in mind though, most of accessories and tools like this come with a following statement in the warranty - ""Lifetime warranty does not cover abuse."" Abuse is sort of what you do to these tools, considering the way most such tools are used; you can't really cradle them. Anyway, it's relatively cheap and you are more likely to lose it before you'll have a chance to break it."
5,Bagus...Bagus...Bagus!,"I have been a fan of Indonesian Music for 10 years. Never have I heard such beautiful music as that which coomes from Java. It is both mystical and relaxing. It really brings you home. Orang Indonesia beli musik desini baugus yea? For those of you who don`t speak Indonesian I said buy this CD and experience a little Indonesia. My name is Mike and I own Indo-Collection a small Indonesian Gift Shop In Alhambra, Ca. I play this CD and bang, customers just wanna stay in my store and listen. Hint Hint Indonesian Gift Shop Owners."
3,condition of book,The content of the book is fine. The quality of the paper back is cheap but manageable for one read. Binding is falling apart as I read it.
4,Spiritual Meaning,I find Tournier's writing very agreeable. He goes into the task of seperating the personage from the person. Basing it on dialect with others and having communication with your own spiritual self Tournier provokes many interesting thoughts. A good read.
4,How 'Bout this Brush?,"What can you say about a shoe brush?It has a nice firm ""hold"" to it and it works pretty well in brushing my shoes. Years later might be a better time to judge -- to see how it holds up over time and whether the bristles remain good. But, for the price, I really like it and I think it may be the last one I ever need to purchase."
4,Best Places in Alaska,I purchases this book as a guide for planning a vacation Alaska for a family that has never been to Alaska. It has met my purposes very well.
4,Cool but the colors are missing,Very good and complete information on Alaska. It would be better if there were maps in color and pictures.
4,"Best Places Alaska: the Best Lodgings, Outdoor Adventures, and Restaurants","I found this book very informative with information on the history of an area as well as sites to vist, what to look for on walking tours or hikes, and where to shop, spend the night, or eat. I especially liked the references to native-made art. However, I also purchased ""Best Places Alaska"" by Don Pitcher and the books are virtually identical (they even use the same phrases to describe a place). I would recommend either of these books but not both."
5,Best Places-Alaska,Haven't made the trip yet but the information contained is both helpful and informative. It has given us many new ideas of place and things to see.
1,Not in stock as advertised.,"Seller shows items as ""in stock"" but they are not in stock, doesn't update listing even after declining your sale."
2,Close but Plastic,"We have used a Krups electric tea kettle for several years and got great service from it. But it is dying and the product is no longer available. We desire a pure play stainless kettle with no plastic for our tea. This kettle, unfortunately, is not it. The is a plastic stem sticking up in the far side from the spout that marks the ""fill to here"" level and some sensor for boiling. Mostly steel but, yuk, who wants plastic tea? The on-off switch came bent as well. Back it goes!"
1,Noisy... and only lasted 7 months!,"I bought this kettle because I thought it looked so nice. It has a light to show when it is on and I love the design. However, from the beginning it was very noisy and took longer to boil than my old Braun plastic kettle. This week it stopped working completely, and when I contacted Toastess they said they will do nothing for me because I can't find the original warranty card. I have only had it 7 months."
4,IT REALLY DOES WHAT IS SAYS,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AT A TARGET NEAR MY HOME AND HAVE BEEN ON A MAN HUNT FOR IT SINCE. I USED TO RELAX MY HAIR OFTEN BUT WANTED TO LIMIT THE PROCESS TO REDUCE DAMAGE, AND THIS PRODUCT HELPED. MY HAIR FELT AS IF I WENT TO A PROFESSIONAL"
2,Not worth it - results just noticeable,"The shampoo was nice in terms of not leaving the hair too dry or tangled, but the conditioner was so thin and the step three coated the hair but not much else. After the shampoo, all my curls were still there. I used this product about 8 or 9 weeks post relaxer on 4b hair."
1,Not true to the Description,This product does not work as it says it would. Makes hair hard and not easy to manage. I would not buy this product again.
3,Its nice,"I got my kit yesterday and i used it ..my hair came out a lot smoother but the curls are still there its not like the ""PERM"" it decreases the frizz but the curls are STILL THERE..what should i do?:|"
5,It's been awhile but I loved it!,"It's been a long time since I used this product, like years. But I used it when I relaxed my hair & it was one of my favorite products. Now that I'm natural but heat trained, I'm wondering if I'd have the same, better or worse results."
5,"Great product. Received quickly, and as described.","I like the color and quality of the book. It's a bit more muted of a color 'in person' than online.I wasn't expecting to receive the product for at least another few weeks based on the Amazon shipping estimate. But, I received it last week (about a week after I ordered it) and was very happy. For me, the shipping was very quick! The product was as described, and am I very happy with my experience with this seller. I plan to purchase similar items from this seller in the future."
2,Disappointing after reading these reviews...,"After the positive reviews written here, I was expecting this to be a realy good album. I guess Billy Porter has a nice voice, but the entire album has no passion or feeling...it's like he's singing the same song over and over and doesn't know what he is supposed to be singing about. The album is produced fairly well, but the instrumentals are basic and lacking anything new or interesting. If you want soft, unobtrusive background music, you might like this CD. I sent it back."
3,Yes it's bad...so bad it's good.,"""The Van"" is a really cheesy 1970's ""R-Rated"" movie. What do I mean by that? I mean that its most obvious attraction was that since it was rated ""R"", chances are you were going to see something naughty. If you watched it, you did. It's very cheaply made, the dialogue is incredibly inane and it has no socially redeeming value. Still, maybe it's something to do with nostalgia, but I find it enjoyable to watch and laugh at. So...I'll give it a ""1"" for overall quality, but a ""5"" for the fact that I enjoyed the trip down memory lane. That's a ""3"" overall!"
3,The Van. C-Movie but a good one.,"I call it a C-Movie, but if Boogie-Vans and other car-related oldschool themes are on your mind...this is what you might have. Not so cool like ""Two Lane Blacktop"" or ""Vanishing Point"" for example (miles away from these) but who cares? Fu Manchu said: The Action is go!"
1,Avoid this ripoff - Buy an LED flashlight instead,"Many of you must have noticed that various manufacturers of power tools are ""giving away"" flashlights with cordless drills, etc. Well, this is how they make money, by charging $5 for ONE flashlight bulb! What a ripoff. In my experience, these light bulbs are cheaply manufactured and blows out in matter of weeks, not years.I recommend that you search for ""4-LED Flashlight"" on Amazon.com and, for a bit more money, buy one of these LED models for which you NEVER have to replace the bulbs."
4,Good Quality Replacement But . . .,"Bought these a while back and got the two-pack for about 8 bucks. I have both a DeWalt 18v and a Ryobi 18v flashlight. Both take the same bulb, and these DeWalt xenon bulbs are bright and hold up pretty well to shock and vibration (I've dropped both lights more than once and the bulbs -- as well as both of the flashlights -- can take a reasonably good beating). But recently I've found the same bulb (looks like same manufacturer, too) branded under the Craftsman name at both Sears and OSH (for those of you in California) selling for $1.49 each. Lots easier to find one there when you need it in a hurry."
3,Not for Porter Cable PC18FL,"I got these for my Porter Cable PC18FL, a pivoting head 18V flashlight. The original bulbs are krypton. These are xenon so they burn considerably brighter and hotter than krypton. The problem is, they melted the plastic bulb holder in the flashlight. The bulb holder only cost 91 cents but good luck trying to find someone who will ship for less than $10."
4,"Good delivery, good product","Took 4 days to arrive; not stellar, but more than acceptable with free shipping. It fits my Ryobi 18v flashlight. I put the 2nd bulb in a Ryobi 14.4v flashlight - it works, but does not appear as bright. I'll consider buying a 14.4v bulb next chance I get."
5,Works well,I got this as a replacement bulb for my Ryobi 18V cordless flashlight. (I was surprised Ryobi did not have one). It works well
2,price and shipping,"I don't know what annoys me more the fact that I paid 10.00 for the bulbs, or the 10.00 shipping charge. If that is the type of vendors that sell from your sight I will think twice before using Amazon again. I don't mind a person making a profit but that was not only excessive, but sneaky. Not fair, I feel that I was had! Live and learn.Ray"
3,Flashlight bulb,Bulb worked great but is not very bright. It replaced a burned out bulb in a Sears Craftsman flashlight but is only about half as bright as the original. It is still usable.
1,Ridiculous!,"It costs about 80 cents to ship these anywhere in the states via postal service, yet RFBDirect seems to have a flat rate of $7. They must be Lunar based. Also, these are garbage bulbs anyway. For the price of a Dewalt tool, you would think they could make a better bulb!"
3,So far so good!,What can I say? I bought this item and installed it into the light and it works. Satisfied as of today.
3,A Missed Opportunity...,"Sadly, they really missed the boat here- Kelsey Grammer is just ""okay"" in the role of ""Scrooge"", but Jason Alexander is woefully miscast as ""Marley"". The REAL treat here is to see so many of London's leading musical theater stars in action: Ruthie Henshall, Dave Willetts, Linzi Hately and Claire Moore- all of whom shined in productions of CHICAGO, PHANTOM, LES MIZ, etc. The females in this production DO shine...Jane Krakowski, Jennifer Love Kewitt and Geraldine Chaplin. And the WONDERFUL score isn't as powerful as on the original Cast album, but I dare you not to shead a tear listening to ""A Place Called Home"" or especially ""God Bless Us Everyone""! This TV production has GREAT production values which alone make it worth watching, but unfortunately Dicken's story gets short-shifted here, and if you want something to evoke that Holiday Spirit this novel usually evokes, if you can find it (as it's out-of-print), listen to the Cast Album!"
4,Good version if you like the story,"I'm not the biggest A Christmas Carol fan--except the Disney version from my childhood--but this is really a good version. Kelsey Grammer is great, and I love to see/hear Jesse L. Martin sing. If you've never seen this, it is worth checking out. I would see it again next Christmas."
1,Just terrible,"This was one of the worst things I have ever seen in my entire life. I love A Christmas Carol, Alastair Sim and George C. Scott did the work justice. I also love the new life that Scrooge gave the work, Albert Finney gave a top notch performance! This musical version came across like nails on the blackboard, I hope to never have to watch this again."
2,Hated it!,"I'm a huge fan of this Dickens classic and have watched almost every version of it. I thought I'd like this one too, after all I loved the tv show Frasier, so why wouldn't I? Well, because this movie was AWFUL. I agree with the reviewer who said, ""If you want a musical, watch the Albert Finney version."" Grammer's version will never grow on me!"
1,Dickens of a mess.,"It is rather telling that on the Amazon UK site, unlike stateside, most reviewers gave this film short shrift, they found this version of 'The Christmas carol' pretty awful.The reasons given were fairly consistent and as follows; the songs are too numerous and very forgettable, the sets, which seem to cover a very small area, are unconvincing in that they bear very little resemblance to Victorian London, the whole demeanor of the proceedings are embarrasingly sugar sweet, and most unforgiveable of all - those british accents are dire, though it does look as if some Brits have been thrown in to even things out. I say all this as a Brit and a long time fan of Kelsey Grammer, as most of us are this side of the pond."
1,Who cast George Costanza as Marley's Ghost?,"I am a lifelong fan of various film versions of ""A Christmas Carol"", and in fact have had a few very flawed versions grow on me after repeated viewings, however this one was just plain horrific. I was shocked and surprised at how poorly executed it was - particularly considering the fantastic cast and the musical genius of Alan Menken involved. I've tried to watch a few times now and just can't get through it. The songs, the acting, and the sets and locations are terrible and not in any way true to the essence of Dickens' story. If you like musicals, the Albert Finney version is SO much better. This one is just a terrible disappointment."
4,A Christmas Carol: The Musical,"It was the classic story, with some really great singers. Jesse Martin was great. I loved it and so did my kids."
4,A wonderful Christmas Story,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed this version of Scrooge. The music is delightful-it will keep you humming the theme even after you are through. Sometimes a musical will drag, but this one is fast moving. This version is now my favorite of all the Scrooge movies. We watched it over and over this Christmas."
3,Not much of a Christmas gift,I love many versions of A Christmas Carol; this one leaves me cold. Kelsey Grammer is definitely miscast as Scrooge.
1,Wrong Scrooge,Unfortunately the Amazon search said that this was A Christmas Carol with Patrick Stewart. I was not prepared for the singing Scrooge! Amazon happily refunded my rental money.
3,Fair choice,Not what I expected. I was not aware that it was a musical. I would let the buyers know in the product description that it is a musical.
1,Don't bother,"I was trying to order Scrooge with Albert Finney and got this instead. We watched it anyway and the unanimous consensus was it is terrible. Bad music, bad acting. It's hard to mess up Scrooge but they did."
4,A Christmas Carol Musical,"A pleasant surprise: the singing was right on, the acting was sincere, and the production quality was superior. This film was not the typical Holiday junk."
5,The only version of 'A Christmas Carol' that I love,"I have seen several movie adaptations of A Christmas Carol, and I find the story very depressing, with just a few minutes of happiness at the end, so I have never enjoyed it.However, when I heard about this one, and heard that Kelsey Grammer (love him) was playing Scrooge, I decided to check it out. So glad I did! This has become a favorite of our family.The best part is the music. It's very well done, more complex and interesting than I expected, and I find myself humming the tunes for weeks after I watch it, they're captivating. My favorite is ""A Place Called Home"", sung by Jennifer Love Hewitt and a young Ebenezer. Her voice is lovely, and the song is just beautiful.Kelsey Grammer was a perfect Scrooge. He captures the ""bah humbug"" type of personality, but was also a loveable changed Scrooge at the end. And he has a wonderful, strong singing voice.I look forward to watching this every Christmas."
1,The very worse movie version of Scrooge.,"Even the very enjoyable, Kelsey Grammer couldn't help with this total flog.Every song within it does nothing but remind one of the far better musical version starring Albert Finney.Aside from some beautiful Czech scenery, there is nothing to suggest a person should watch this movie, much less purchase it."
4,a great christmas movie,"I love this movie in some way's it better than the Albert Finey version the songs the characters are great Kesly Grahamer does a great job, to me it;s a classic in itself, my only complaint is that I wish it were widescreen, great movies. you will enjoy it. i watch it even when it's not christmas"
3,A Christmas Carol (Musical),"I received this DVD in good time and fine, unused condition. It is a musical, with some good acting, especially from Kelsey Grammar, and was kind of fun to watch. However, I rated it just ""okay"" because the music is very repetitive; I thought there should have been more various types of music and lyrics, as opposed to the same one used throughout."
4,Christmas Carol: the musical,"A lot of people didn't care for this made-for-TV operetta, but we did. There are so many versions of this much-loved story that we could argue it is just one more, but it was pleasant to watch and listen to, so we recommend it."
4,A Christmas Carol: The Musical - Kelsey Grammer,Likeable characters and good music. Some excellent special effects and surprise scenes. I didn't know that Kelsey Grammer could sing. Four stars.
2,A Christmas Carol The Musical,"Tho it arrived in perfect shape and on time, it was the wrong version. Rather than go thru the hassel of a return, I ordered another one. It will be late but, at least, it will be right this time-hopefully."
3,A Compilation Worth Checking Out !,"This 2cd compilation was released to celebrate Topic Records sixtieth birthday , but I suppose it`s really an introductory cd to the delights of Topic`s rich array of artists , and the legacy that they`ve left over the last forty years .If you`re open minded to music , you`ll discover over 2 hours of ecletic folk music performed by some of the finest talent that the British Isles , and Ireland has to offer .This cd is a great listening experience in it`s own right , but once these songs are etched in your brain , you`ll be out hunting down the original Topic albums that they came from .Go on , buy it , it`s cheap enough !"
3,life's real,"I HAVE LISTENED TO THIS CD AND I REALLY LIKE IT. I AM SURPRISED NOT TO SEE IT IN STORES OR ON THE RADIO.I HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE LISTENED TO THE CD AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHEN MORE WOULD BE AVAILABLE. THUGGED OUT IS THE BOMB, AND LIFE'S REAL! IT SOUNDS LIKE MUSIC THAT SHOULD BE PLAYED IN CLUBS. IT'S HOT AND REALISTIC.I CAN VIBE TO IT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD REALLY BLOW UP.SO I GIVE IT 3 STARS AND HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM THE NEW ARTIST THE LAST EMPERORS. GOOD LUCK! AND 1 LUV"
1,I too wish I had read the reviews.,This was an impulse purchase going only by the notes on the back of the book. They are so misleading as to be laughable. It is written in a very confusing manner. I was over a third of the way in before I realized Toby and Ruben were the same person. I am not wasting my time finishing the book nor can I give it to anyone I like.
5,Alice Mattison has written a masterpiece!,"Alice Mattison is an exceptional, critically acclaimed authorof both short stories and novels. With ""The Book Borrower,""Mattison has reached a new artistic peak. This novel isengrossing, stimulating, and artistically satisfying. TobyRuben is the book borrower. Toby borrows the book from hernew friend Deborah Laidlaw. The book is about a young femaleJewish anarchist. The lives of Toby and Deborah, theirhusbands and children, and the Jewish anarchist twine andintertwine.Alice Mattison gives us a picture of life in New Haven from theearly 1970's through the 1980's, and life in a small NewEngland town in the 1920's. Mattison has done her research, and the characters and the events in their lives ring true.""The Book Borrower"" is an extraordinary literary tour de force.Don't miss it!"
4,Friendship Bonding..,"The Book Borrower was about friends bonding even when they have evil, negative thoughts brewing. Alice Mattison was inside the narrators head. Even when I wanted to shake Toby Ruben, (and why was she called Rubin throughout?) she was human. It may be the vogue not to have quotation marks as characters speak / think all in one sentence. I got the drift of this quickly. Bringing history into the book with Rubin's flashback to her childhood, immigrant parents and trolley strikes was interesting. I thought the book was well written. Other reviewers thought otherwise.Read John Steinbecks short storys before this book. That is a hard act to follow.When is the next Alice Mattison?Could hardly wait to pass on to friend."
1,The Book Borrower,"I wish that I, too, would have read the negative reviews, while plowing through this book. I would then have not thought that I was crazy trying to finish it for our book review group. Not one of our readers, including me, found this book to have any merit. It is not well written, and remains very disjointed until the end. The author jumps ahead those ten years, without any warning. When did she manage to squeeze in that bizarre creature from the past? I think I missed that when I blinked.We'll probably not need more than 10 minutes to discuss this book unless we're going to talk about the negative impact it has had on us!"
1,Really boring,"I had to laugh when I read most of the other reviews. This was indeed one of the most boring books ever written. I couldn't find a single pleasant thing to say about either of the main characters and could not understand why they became friends. I couldn't understand why Ruben liked Deborah so much, or why they remained friends over the years. They both seemed selfish and dull. I could not finish it. Luckily, I borrowed it from the library; wish I'd read these customer reviews before I even bothered to do that."
1,It doesn't even deserve one star,"This book is extremely dull. It was hard to ""get into"" and infact, I never did ""get into"" it. I like the concept that a friendship keeps returning to a book borrowed in the beginning, but the author could have done better. The book in the book is confusing and not very entertaining. If you feel that you MUST read this book, I would recommend checking it out from a library. Don't waste your money on it."
2,well-done but not very exciting even though it tries,"Mattison is a careful writer and that is the problem. Nothing much happens in her books, and her male characters especially are sort of henpecked. This is her best novel, for sure, but it still doesn't have the oomph of, say, Ann Tyler. There is a literary-ness to the writing that is mostly successful, but it's a curious mix of flannel shirt and kitchen table chat which feels quite authentic and then complex dynamics between characters and plot maneuvers which feels forced, as if the author is trying to figure out how to give readers something more lively than is her instinct to do. The way these characters bored me reminds me of the way my neighbors bore me!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This had to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. It looked promising. Even half way thru it picked up a little, but when I read the last page, I turned it over looking for the end of the story. This book is choppy, disconnected and just flat poorly written. Main character is a whining woman who gets on your nerves and stays there. She never changes.Do NOT waste your time or money on this, there are too many other good books to read"
3,Scattered Thinking in a Nutshell,If you like rapidly jumping from one person's thoughts to another's it's a great read. I just couldn't keep up. Perhaps if I read it slower it would help.
5,Excellent Short Survey,This book gives a great overview of Ukraine's history and Ukrainian-Russian relations. It's central argument is that relations are likely to remain peaceful between these two great Slavic states unless Ukraine's economy does much worse than Russia's or Ukrainian nationalism (concentrated among a decided minority of Ukrainians in Galicia in western Ukraine) grows markedly. Lieven argues that the West should not encourage the nationalists as stronger old-style Ukrainian nationalism would be one of the few things to harm the otherwise extremely close and good relations between Ukrainians and Russians throughout much of the rest of Ukraine. Well-written and a lot packed into this thoughtful good work that remains relavant in 2001.
4,My point of view,"Point of View by DB Boulevard is one of the hotter Euro club smash of 2002 along with Iio's Rapture. Featuring Moony's soaring vocal, the song hails back to the good old days of early 90's Euro dance music without sounding overly passe. In fact, it's rather refreshing and the Lange remix here turns the song into hell of a monster dancefloor smash. Excellent!"
2,"I really tried to like this book, but...",I really tried to like this book but just couldn't. The writing was just too high schoolish for me. I didn't particularly care for the folks involved. Too much of the modern world leaked in. It was an effort to finish the book.
2,Tired of the Same Old Song......,"We have what sounds like an intriging story. I won't bore you with all of the details as previous reviewers have covered most of it.I will get to the point with my dissatisfation.We have an intelligent young lady, that has been the head of her household for a while. All of a sudden a Prince comes along and she is incapable of making decisions for herself. All of a sudden she and her sisters need a father that abandoned them 15 years before.These same helpless women run a sucessful business, but are still incapable of making decisions concering their own safety.Wait...... I almost forgot that the Prince needed to drug and kidnap her (all for her own good of course). I guess kidnapping was an accepted practice during that period.I am tired of reading books where strong, capable women, become needy, helpless girls when they meet a man. It is ridiculous."
2,Unappealing Hero and Heroine,"It started off on the right foot. The charming Russian prince falls for the lowly opera singer. Throw in six sisters, the next door neighbor cum detective, several secondary budding romances, serial killers, a war between prima donnas, a deadbeat sire of said heroine and her siblings. And somewhere buried beneath it all is our prince charming and cinderella.There was very little sexual tension between the leads and I couldn't care less if they got together or not. They both got on my nerves by the middle of the book at which point I skimmed to the end.I recommend picking up Ms. Grasso's older work for truly excellent reads. This is not her best."
3,Enjoyable if you can get past the Hero and Heroine,"I though the heroine was incredibly childish, selfish and repetitive. I almost stopped reading after one such childish incident. I also understand hurting and loving at the same time but this character and author did not do it justice. Then the hero, I thought he was quite charming, smart, and lovable, but like all men after sex they just get dumb. What I really did not like about the author's writing style is that she would develop their ""secondary "" characters stories, so we would know the beginning and the end but not know the middle. I have to say though I am intrigued by the heroine's sister Belle and Raven stories so I may give the author another try."
1,Do Not Get This Album,"I'm a fan of their first five albums but this album is awful.It's slow, annoying and very boring.Cans vocals are back to being they way they use to be, not as good as Chapter v, that's the best Cans has ever sounded.No effort put into this album."
3,Hammerfallen and they can't get up!,"I have been a Hammerfall fan for over a decade. My journey into power metal began with Legacy of Kings, and maybe the standard was set too high. Threshold seems to exist in a world that is quickly becoming polished, tame, and boring, which occasionally hearkens back to the days of power metal glory. Beowulf is dead, the afterglow of victory is gone, and life has become routine. That's what this album feels like at the crux, much like an annual celebration to re-tell the glorious tale, and all the performers and cantors just going through the motions like they did the last time. Hopefully the beast will return...."
2,Going down hill FAST,Nothing new on this CD. Slow to mid-paced music..nothing fast to bang your head at. Average or below lyrics and riffs...nothing groundbreaking. Bland and boring. Too bad...I really liked these guys. I think this is the last time I buy anything from this band.
5,once again classic heavy metal,"yeah its not as good as past albums,but this thing still rocks...these guys never disappoint...give it about 3 or 4 listens and it starts getting catchy...hevay metal is the law with them!!!!!"
3,Typical HammerFall...but very average at best,"I've been a fan of HammerFall for about 7 or 8 years now and I have to say that there's nothing too impressive about this album. It's still good power metal, but it sounds very much the same as Chapter V or Crimson Thunder. Personally, I think each of their albums after Renegade have gotten worse...more predictable, very basic drum work, etc. Worth a listen or 2, but nothing that stands out here. If you're interested in this band, stick with getting Glory To The Brave or Legacy Of Kings before anything else."
4,Long Awaited and Highly Anticipated,"A good album, indeed, however a little more 'commercialized' than I had anticipated. Every band that has found fame and a future in the music industry is expected to release an album that defies their roots - to dip in the commercial arena - and I believe this album is the one where HammerFall dips.Overall, the album is tight: good song-writing, excellent riffs and powerful rythms. A lot more background vocals in this one over their previous releases, but the vocals are well blended and truly enhance the album.The album was only released today so I'm sure it will continue to grow on me. Honest judgement: this album parallels Chapter 5: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken and is far better in quality over their debut albums. A must-have for HammerFall fans, of course - and for any serious metal fan.. considering some of the other junk out there that claims to be 'metal'."
1,You'd better be a dog fanatic or trainer!!!,"I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance."
5,Un ejemplo de vida,"Las obras completas de San Ignacio de Loyola constituyen sin duda un tesoro de incalculable valor no solo para los cristianos, sino para todos aquellos que creen en las bondades del amor al prójimo. La profunidad espiritual e intelectual de Iñigo es sorprendente y sin duda se encuentra profundamente inspirada con ayuda de la gracia de Dios. Sus consejos y reflexiones son una ayuda de inestimable valor para alcanzar la verdadera felicidad a que todos estamos llamados. Un libro para leer y releer, un compañero de inestimable valor para nuestro viaje por este mundo."
4,Good mix of anthologies for the genre,"The book is a good blend of short stories on this literary segment branded as porn or erotica. The authors chosen for the book show they are interested in writing on the subjects. Although the subject matter of the stories was not always to my liking or tastes, it is a worthwhile book in my opinion."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"A MOVIE THAT YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER AND ENJOY EACH TIME, GREAT ACTINGMOVIE THINK WAS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL GODFATHER"
1,"Dark, dark, darker.......","Movie is a joke, this two disk set is worth crap... Scenes are so dark, what a joke... How a movie studio ever let this pass with the really poor and I mean really poor quality, awful would be the correct word.... Save your money on this one, wow, what a piece of crap..... Trust me on the quality, junk !!!!! If I could have given this a zero I would have...."
3,The Godfather Part II,"Pacino was perfect in his role, as Michael continued on the path he mapped out in the first movie. DeNiro was masterful as a young Vito Corleone, a fitting tribute to Brando. But they were revisiting old ground. I didn't see a whole lot here that wasn't in the first movie. They're just doing ""that thing they do."" I have the third movie, but I don't feel motivated to watch it, and I'm not saying that because the critics panned it. Maybe I'm just gangstered out. Post-Godfather, I've seen THE UNTOUCHABLES as a syndicated TV series and as a Kevin Costner movie, THE SOPRANOS, ANALYZE THIS, ANALYZE THAT..."
1,bad movie,"it was a fine well acted film but too slow and boring too many times. I guess that 1 star is a little harsh but when I saw it I wanted a gangster movie, not a family drama."
5,Godfather II,"Of the 3 movies in the Godfather Saga, this one is my favorite. I like this one because it shows how Vito became the Godfather. This movie also stars in my opinion two of the greatest actors ever- Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. DeNiro won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Michael Corleone. My siblings and I usually get together once a year to watch the Godfather Saga. Now we will have The Godfather Saga on Dvd, as I have also purchased The Godfather III also. So if you are a fan of the Corleone family get this dvd. The price was nice also."
2,Good Movie - Dirty Disc,Bought this movie and had problems getting it to play.Had to take it out and clean it even though it was supposedly brand new.The DVD cover looked like it had been used and rewrapped.Should have sent it back but...
2,pointless and predictable,The second and third sequels of the GODFATHER try to milk the brilliant first part for all the money to be had. Don't waste your time.
3,The Godfather Part II,Since I have not seen The Godfather Part I it took a while to connect with it. But when I did proved to be a good movie about the mafia.
5,Second best movie ever beaten only by part one!!!,"Fantastic movie, only beaten by part one. Pacino is fantastic and an excellent Don. The flash backs into the younger days of the family are very well done, with Dinero doing and outstanding job. This movie has to be watched several times in order to understand all of the tie in's to both parts....."
4,Robert De Niro!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the second best Godfather film, if not the best. It is so good it's worth watching the entire 3hours and 20 minutes . Fredo's actor does a good job , Pacino does a good job (not as good as the first) , Diane Keaton does a good job, and Talia Shire is very good in the later parts of the film. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it should have had more Vito Corleone parts than Micheal Corleone parts. I could watch a 4hour long movie if it had Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone. Rent it or buy it, because I swear you'll be satisfied."
5,Great Movie,This movie was well written. I would suggest this movie to anyone. I have never seen another well-written movie. It just cannot compare to any of our present day movies. Five stars all the way!
5,Great sequel,"Even better than the original - because it probes deeper into the personalities, especially of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his obsession with family and loyalty and snubbing out his enemies. He is quiet, educated, and coldly calculating. The movie traces his dealings in the 1950s-60s, set mainly in Nevada. Interspersed with these developments is the story of the rise of his father Don Vito Corleone in Little Italy in NYC in the 1920s, with Robert De Niro doing a brilliant job in that role. Both stories are excellently told. Despite my never quite understanding America's obsession with the mafia and its ilk, it's not hard to conclude that this is a major movie achievement."
5,love it!,I had actually seen all the Godfather movies...my husband hadn's. He loved them as well! They never get old! Watch them again. I am always surprised in the new things I see!
5,All the Godfather series is great.,One of the greatest movies ever made. Something you will watch again and again. Also educational about the Mafia. Enough Said
2,"Great Movie, Poor Quality Stream","Hi,Never have problems with m Roku, but for some reason this movie (1 of my all time favs) was constantly interrupted by ""buffeting""."
5,Love of classic passed on to next generation,"I read the Godfather over 30 years ago when I was in high school. Francis Ford Coppola is the rare director who can make a book burst to life on the movie screen. The perfect casting forever embeds the images of these great actors into these unforgettable characters for both the movie viewer and the reader. It is a great book made into a great movie. I have shared my love of this movie with my daughter, Bethany. We watch it every time it comes on t.v. This was her favorite Christmas gift."
4,Godfather 2,It was an excellent follow up to the 1st one. I have to admit I've seen it dozens of times in the past. There was one thing I noticed about the screen quality: dark in some places to a point where i wished I could adjust the contrast or the brighness. Otherwise I enjoyed it for the upteenth time :)
1,Good God Father,"I bought this item for my father, thinking full well that it would come here sealed and in relatively good condition. I was wrong..dead wrong. The case was in plastic wrap that looked like it went through the shredder. The case was cracked in 3 different places. I don't even know if the disc works but by the way the case is looking, I believe it will be completely scratched and unable to play. I bought the ""Used-New"" blue-ray..but it was HEAVILY used. It was an overall disappointing purchase. I'm now waiting for a response from Jakes to see if I can get a replacement or my money fully returned to me. I can't give this to my dad on Christmas..he'll put my horses head in my bed."
3,"The Godfather, part II",Fast shipping but the movie was not in any kind of a case. It was packaged (both disks) in an envelope. That was kind of annoying. Thanks for the movie though. We do love it.
5,Awesome metal,"Jon Olivas side project with Chris Caffery is totally mind blowing!! This album is fantastic, a must for savatage fans! As soon as you here the first song... your off your chair rockin !!"
3,Worth the price,"Perhaps not the best down pillow, but I paid $20 a piece for them. It does not provide for ""excellent head and neck alignment"" as described. You'd need 4 just to be comfortable. I won't use them for myself, but will put them on a guest bed. If you really want a decent down pillow, you'll have to spend more. I also recommend buying one in person so you can feel it for yourself. A good pillow is just too important! (And a good down pillow is just heaven!)"
2,The movie itself is good buuuut......,"The first time I bought this movie from Amazon, the sound cut out halfway through. I didn't bother to return it because I bought it used from an Amazon seller super cheap, and it wasn't really worth what I paid to go through the hassle of returning it.I got another copy last year for Christmas as a gift and I was super excited to watch it again. However, for some reason this version does not have the Japanese language option, and the dubbing is just...ugh. Not even close to passable.Find a version of this movie in Japanese, or don't bother watching it at all."
4,Resident Evil minus the zombies,i've seen a lot of negative reviews of this movie but i actually really enjoyed it. If you have ever played the resident evil game series you will find some similarities between the game and this movie. The whole movie is basically the two main characters exploring a huge mansion with all kinds of creepy items (even the creepy portraits in every room) and key collecting. I liked how the movie kept switching from a normal style to a videogame style. I won't spoil it but the film also has a great ending.
1,Empty and wandering,"I rented this and it sounded promising, but I should really know better by now...I agree that it did remind me of a video game - one I played where I had to scale the roof and climb up into a creepy bedroom window..., there weren't really any surprises, and what was the point of the sibling ending??I thought that there was one scary moment, when they ran in to hide in that room, but it was so fleeting. I remember thinking that they could have gone in a ton of different directions with the movie, but they didn't. It makes me wary what I rent now."
4,"""from long ago""","I've liked this anime: Dinosaur king scent it was airing on the CW for kids TV station, poke'mon and also funny glad you have it on dvd....^_^"
2,Dalida/ pour toujour,"I didn't like it very much, because I thought it was concert dvd video, but unfortunately it is not. I guess because the description of the product was not clear enough myself or anyone else to understand whether it's a dvd music video or it's the dvd film."
2,AMBER ALERT FOR EDDIE MONEY AND DICKEY BETTS VOICES!,"Wow, a lot of talking. No, a L O T of talking on this concert. The sound is not even that great. Eddie Money sounded so bad I couldn't look at my TV set. That is 6 bucks I will never get back again...the only strong points were Michael Bolton and Loverboy."
2,Could have been great,"This dvd could have been great . Loverboys were good, but Eddie Money was unable to sing, so he tried to make people sing for him and it doesn't work."
1,I know this guy,"I find it amazing that Chad Connelly, whom I have known since he was in high school would have the guts to write a book which screams about our ""freedoms"" being eroded when he belongs to every right wing group which seeks to limit our civil liberties and civil rights in the state of South Carolina.Stay away from this drivel."
4,Fabled Creatures Puzzle Review,"This was a great puzzle! Pieces are reasonably durable, and the scene interesting. The sky and stars portion of the puzzle was a bit of a challenge for an 8 year old since there's little color variation there, so that part got a bit tedious. Had enough detail in the puzzle to find little surprises that are easily overlooked at first glance. This is such a great family activity to help bond and spend quality time together, while also being an educational activity for children. Great conversations."
1,Fool and his money,"Throughout my lifetime I have been known to spend some of my money foolishly by some people's standards. I have bought things that will only be valuable to me and I have had to endure some grief for those things.This thing, that I had to buy because I had no other choice at the time, may go down as one of my worst purchases of all time. When I saw it at the store- I thought this thing will never work, but after some encouragement from the sales person that these boots are in use and are the only ones I could get, I bought one. Once I started to put it on I regretted cutting my cracked one. The bolts slip through the holes, it is hard to clamp on and when it flexes it opens gaps. I had to put sealant all over it as I foresee it leaking grease and allowing dirt/water in.Find a solid boot, there is no better way."
1,horrible,it stops working after three times and dosn't move. WASTE OF MONEY. instead i recomend equalizer mines still works perfectly and has fallen off of many things.p.s.the equalizer costs the same amont of money and is a lot better. i would rate it %stars overall
2,"A really great idea, but...","I really wanted this product to work. I am a professional groomer and just needed an extra ""hand"" to hold the dryer at times.This worked okay for a few times, but then the bolts started coming out that held the flexible part to the dryer and the clamp. No problem, just tighten them up.The clamp only wants to stay stable if the item you are clamping it too is quite thick. Otherwise, it tilts and turns and doesn't hold it steady. Then there is the issue of the flexible tubing holding the dryer up; it loses it's holding power. I now have a droopy flexy thing that doesn't hold the dryer aloft.In addition to that, it's really noisy and is just a bad design overall.Again, I really think this was a great idea. I mean, I bought one. It just doesn't hold up to usage."
1,Not as advertised,"The arm provided will not support the dryer. The clip is very difficult to open and close. The dryer does not have much power and little to no heat. Pretty much worthless, very disappointing."
1,disappointed,I received the Metro Flex dryer last night. It won't even stay up! The unit is too heavy for the flexible cable holding it! The clamp takes two men and a baby to open.....I am returning this dryer ASAP!
1,Don't waste your money,"I was very disappointed in this dryer. It lacks greatly in only blowing cool air. For the money, I would have expected more than one air setting. It's heavy and cumbersome. I rarely use it any more and feel I wasted my money. I also bought a metro grooming case & had to send it back because it came apart after the second use. I'm not impressed with Metro products & will not buy anything by Metro in the future."
4,incredible,"This is a DVD about an incredible man with a completely crazy story. I for one believe every word of it--but even if you do not, watch this to get to know Billy Meier. He's worth it."
3,The real most interesting man in the world?,"You know that beer commercial with ""the most interesting man in the world?"" Well, Billy Meier is the real thing.He's the source of hundreds of photos and videos of UFOs, taken around the world. He claims to have had contact with extraterrestrials since 1942. In fact, some of his photos are claimed to have been taken from UFOs.A veteran of the French Foreign Legion, now missing an arm, with a 2-foot-long beard, Billy Meier calmly explains the most fantastic things in his native German (he's Swiss.) Most interesting is the relationship between religion and the extraterrestrials. Also fascinating is an interview with Meier's son, who grew up as the son of the local ""nut-case.""Whether you believe in alien visitation or not, this DVD is a great introduction to a fascinating character."
4,McGahern's Dark Mind,"McGahern is a difficult author to read and takes time to deeply appreciate. The Dark explores the choices one makes in determining one's course in life. The hero of the novel struggles with the the Church's teachings and his lustful desires, which creates a very real tension. Reading the book will make you understand why it was widely banned for many years, and also appreciate McGahern's ability to capture pre-Celtic Tiger Ireland. Every time I read McGahern I feel as if Ireland has come alive before me. McGahern is a wonderful author and this book is vital to his body of literature."
2,Dark & Disappointing,I was looking forward to reading this based on the reviews but was quite disappointed. The books takes a lot for granted and makes jumps in the story that are not supported. If this represents John McGahern then I doubt I will be reading anything else from the author.
2,An Adolescent Reflection,"A short, ugly, sad account of a young Irish boy's progress through adolescence. Written in the Irish idiom, its meanings are difficult to understand especially to one speaking American English. A long struggle of a read ending in disappointment. I am of Irish descent and had hoped to learn something of the Irish culture. Unfortunately with that endeavor in mind I purchased three of his novels, I hope ""The Dark"" is not an indication of the content of the other two."
3,More cyberpunk,I've been trying to go through whatever anybody says is cyberpunk and have come across some horrible books. This one isn't half bad. It's got some good twists and the ending is something unexpected. If you like cyberpunk novels I'd add this to your list.
4,Modern Pirates-Of-The-Maylay-Penninsula Story,"An engaging and exciting, if uneven story, taking place on a hijacked cruise ship and a guided missle frigate in the South Pacific. This is the first novel I've read involving modern day piracy - a very real threat to cargo vessels today.Technical maritime detail is good, as are character and story development, although much time is spent developing the Executive Officer Robinson's back story without much payoff at the end. Perhaps Setlowe is setting-up the Robinson character for future novels. His Captain Stewart has legs - as does Maggi Chamberlain. Expect to see them again in the next edition. Good, quick Summer Navy-action read. I enjoyed it."
4,World History and Naval Tactics lesson in a suspense novel,"It think this is a great book. Setlowe covers US Naval tactics, south-east Asian history and culture, and modern politics. However, he is a little thin in his explanations sometimes leaving you feeling like you're missing all of the information.The characters are well done and the story, while confusing sometimes, keeps you constatntly turning the pages."
3,"Heats okay, oscillating gears shredded","This is a reliable space heater that puts out a fair amount of heat. The thermostat controls work (more or less) like any other heater -- whatever you select, when the temperature around the heater reaches that level, the unit shuts off. As long as you don't expect it to correctly monitor room temperature, you're fine. We have had ours for a couple of years now and after about 18 mos the oscillating gears started falling apart, making clicking noises and leaving little pieces of plastic behind. It is still usable but not with oscillation. It is also noisy (loud fan) and is only used by us as a backup heater when other options are not available (ie one of our radiant flat panels died)."
3,Splenda flavors,"I love these Splenda flavors and they are not that easy to find in the grocery stores. However, the cost of shipping was a SHOCK - $11.00! Not a bargain. I'll buy them at a store from now on. I wonder why such a light box of product would cost so much to ship? Ridiculous!"
5,splenda coffee sticks,"I have loved these little coffee sticks for a while and decided to get Mocha to try out.I have tried Hazelnut,Vanilla, and some others I can't think of right now. I really like them. They make plain coffee taste so much better and I seem to drink more with these. Don't know if that's good or not , but I don't care, as long as it""s good."
2,old product,"The store stopped stocking this, so I bought online, over 1/2 of the pouchesin each box are useless because instead of getting powder,it's hard as a rock in each pouch, so you can't get the product out."
5,Great Tasting Coffee Flavoring - Highly Recommeded!,"Splenda Mocha Coffee Flavor is my favorite coffee sweetener. Being diabetic I have to avoid sugar, which is unfortunate since I really like sweet flavored coffee. Splenda makes several flavors in these convenient packets that help satisfy my sweet cravings (I use two packets in a largish coffee mug).I also likeSplenda No Calorie Sweetener, Flavor Blends for Coffee, French Vanilla, 30-Count Boxes (Pack of 6).Highly Recommended!CFH"
2,I am not a fan,I don't think this is tasty. I prefer my coffee black but thought this sounded like a good idea. If I want a change I prefer a sugar free syrup like salted caramel.
2,The world IS flat!,"Good info but, reading it was akin to reading the IRS rules and regulations. It's a small book and I had to force myself to finish it."
4,An Excellent Read,"I read this book for a science fiction class which I am currently taking at the University of Southern California. The detail which Stirling employs in his writing is among the best I have encountered in this genre of literature. It is a classic ""good vs. evil"" plot line. As demonic as the Draka's motives are it is quite interesting to see how they maintain their classical lifestyle with an iron fist. The Alliance is a society whose strength is in technology. And the Draka have devious plans to destroy the Alliance by means of Bio-technology. The novel is a complex chess game in which world domination is the prize. I have not read any other of the Draka Series, but I will no doubt check them out."
5,Part of the best Alternate History series ever.,"Steve Stirling's writing is detailed and dense. These doesn't mean it is hard to comprehend, quite the contrary - just detailed. Close your eyes, and you are there. Drakon doesn't make any sense unless you have read Marching Through Georgia, Under the Yoke, and The Stone Dogs. Although some would call these books classic good versus evil, there is more substance to the story and history line than that. The bad guys are not so bad, and are totally believable in the context of human nature. The good guys are not always good, and in the end, it is questionable if they win. Human drama, life, death, history, alternate technology, the Draka series is about as good as it gets."
3,Do you have a strong stomach?,"The entire Draka series is fascinating, but _The Stone Dogs_ requires eve more than did _Marching through Georgia_ or _Under the Yoke_ that you have a very strong stomach. If you don't, you'll never finish it."
3,A little too much fiction.,"The Stone Dogs is the end of the conflict between good vs. evil, on our world as we know it. Although it's very heart-stopping and the Alliance (Americans and it's allies) loses, it really doesn't end. I have a hard time fathoming the explosion of technology and advancement in space travel in the 3 decades after WW 2 (Eurasian War in the Draka timeline). In their 1970's, they were into technology not even applied (or even possible) in our present...30 years later. Considering overall history, the Draka have either been too fortunate to survive the Alliance, or the Alliance was too weak to act against their would-be conquerors. The Domination did just that...dominate, and the Alliance was asleep at the wheel."
5,Would you believe Elvis?,"I am a New Yorker. The first session I ever went to was in Studio B at Columbia 52nd Street around 1966 to watch a group called The Virginians cut a couple of sides. (The Virginians failed but their lead singer later recorded the hit ""Good Morning Starshine"" under the name Oliver.) Since then I have been in about half the studios in the book as either a musician, a producer or a visitor/hanger on. Until ""Studio Stories"" I thought I knew a lot about the subject. But I didn't know that Elvis cut ""Don't Be Cruel"" and ""Hound Dog"" here or a pair of tracks on Led Zep II were made here.""Studio Stories"" is also a capsule history of popular music recording from the `50s of Mitch Miller, Sinatra and Tony Bennett to the advent of the Digital Recording Era. It is a mini-encyclopedia of how engineers, producers and musicians got sounds, overcame limitations and made some of the best recordings ever produced."
3,"Good, but glitzy","Being that my background was the recording business for some years, I read this with especial interest. The book is written in the glitzy Hollywood style, where everything is just a little bit brighter, just a little bit better. In terms of history, it's very good, but giving the impression that everything happened in New York.Los Angeles, Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Nashville, Chicago were also centers of recording for many years. ""From Downbeat to Vinyl"" is another look at a giant of the recording business."
1,Don't do it....,"I wish I would have listened to the other reviewer who gave this film a one star. It would have saved me 60 minutes of my night. I couldn't even finish this movie, it was that bad. Normally when I see Wolfe Video, I expect a good gay drama. They gave us movies like Gia and Elena Undone and The Gymnist. Imagine my surprise when I popped this in and got just what the reviewer said; a dry porn with even worse acting. There were 2 attractive women, but no chemistry, no story, and really, really bad acting. The love scene in the hot tub reminded me of the pool scene in Showgirls, but worse. To quote the film, ""My shoulders are so tight. I haven't ridden a bike in a long time."" Ok, how are your shoulders sore from that? Did you pedal with your arms? Come on!I love a lot of Wolfe Video productions. This one should never have been released."
1,whoa sOoo bad!,"Oh soooo terrible cheezy corny fake zerO chemistry & terrible terrible acting.The entire film is like a overly wordy dry porn with acting not much better, all I could think was ""ew this is like a guys wet dream"" = including the ""oh your so tense"" back massage, corny overdone shower scene... come to find out it is a male's wet dream; written produced and directed by the same guy..."
1,STOP don't waste your money or your time,"Sucked. I wish I had read the reviews before buying the video. I was bored with nothing to do and thought this was a good idea. Well, I am still bored but I have something to do...beat myself up for watching this and thinking it had to get better because it can' get any worse.'"
1,One of the worse movie I ever seen!,"Bad acting, bad story line and the dialogue were totally unconvincing! I cannot wait until it was OVER! Totally disappointed that Wolfe Films even released this film!"
3,Just sort of blah,Not very realistic.... not a big fan of the characters.. .not the best acting. Leaves a lot to be desired.
1,The House Guest movie,"There needs to be better movies than this...the acting was terrible!Elena Undone, Loving Annabelle And Perfect Ending are great great movies!"
1,Don't bother!,This is the worst film I have ever watched. There is simply nothing redeeming about it. It saddens me to think I wasted valuable minutes of my life on it.
1,Just awful,"I'm sorry to say that it was a pretty bad movie. I quit watching after 20 min. Bad acting, cheesy story line, no chemistry between the two girls."
2,Do not waste your money,"No real story line. No good acting. Not enough or good nudity, no real sex scenes. I am not sure what is positive about this movie? I am not good at narrating movies but I can tell you that out of blue one woman shows up at the door steps of another female and announces she is the one her dad is renting, allowing to stay? her in the guest house. Next thing you know, these two are kissing and they are in bed. No real nudity, other than brief flashes. Sex scene were amateurly done without really showing any skin at all. So,this is a waste of your money movie."
1,"Very,very Bad Flix","I just could not wait for this film to end.Iy was very,very boring, And the acting was extremely bad.My three year old nice could have done a better job.I could just go on and on about how awful this was to me."
2,Movie was not all that entertaining,"It wasn't all that great, I thought there would be more substance and the acting was bad. I purchased this because I thought it would be entertaining but I could not get passed the bad acting."
1,Guest Houws,"OMG! I wouldn't even rate this as a bad porn movie. The brunette is beautiful and the blonde looks like a porn actress gone bad. The scripting is so dry and so is the sex scenes. Don't waste time and and for 3.99, the 1.99 movies are much better. Can't believe Wolfe productions released this."
3,Guest House,"Good movie, interesting, kept my interest. The story line was interesting, and the ending was easy to follow and expected."
2,Guest House ... Not at my House,"Movie was slow developing. You knew where it was headed at the very beginning. Acting poor, filming not real good."
3,Sweet story,"Very simply this is a love story between two very young girls. It's not as cheesy as people say it is. My favorite character is Rachel, the girl who played her was very natural and easy on the eyes."
4,A Work of Art,"Tales from Gold Mountain contains evocative illustrations and enduring Chinese Folk Tales. I enjoyed reading the short stories and sharing them with my junior high students. This book would be an excellent companion for American History Teachers, in that it gives a more authentic cultural view of the Chinese immigration to the U.S."
1,"wordy and rambling, not the book I need","Part of what makes this text so difficult to understand is the author's inability to use consistent terms while trying to explain material. If you try to implement the pseudo-code in Matlab, you will find a lot of problems. Very dissapointed with the book."
3,"Still Geodyssey - fascinating , but a little different","No matter what the other reviewers say, Geodyssey was still a good read, like all of Piers Anthony's books have been. There are, admittedly, some sections which could have been toned down or shortened, take your pick. I speak specifically of the 40,000 word long story of Melee and Dillon which seems to be a tale told of a romance based on urination and sex and control. There was a brief mention of cannibalism seemingly from the view of ""waste not, want not."" As I said at the beginning, it is still a good read - the historical settings are fascinating, and while some of the stories are conjectural, Mr. Anthony readily admits to this. It is a good read some will have trouble with and some will not, like any other book. if you have read Piers Anthony before, especially previous Geodyssey installations, read this."
3,"Not the best, but it'll do.","I loved the other 3 Geodyssey books. They're among my favourite novels and I keep trying to get others to read them. I waited a year and a half for Muse of Art to come to paperback so that I could finally read it. Well, I must say I was a little disappointed! The history was good just like in the other 3, but it read like bad erotica. Piers himself stated somewhere that the Geodyssey series wasn't selling the way he had hoped, I think he's now stooping too low on purpose to try to make it sell.We can only hope that Climate of Change (the fifth and final) has the quality of the first three."
2,Not sure why I keep reading this series...,"Really didn't like this book. There is even less continuity in this than the previous volume. This makes it very hard for me to care about any of the characters.Some of the ""history"" in this is made up, making it far less compelling than the other books in the series. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because the chapter on Stalingrad was mostly interesting.I don't think that Anthony knows what the word ""art"" means. According to this book, the following are arts: seduction, arrogance, ploy, justice, politics, survival, irony, and destruction. There were more chapters devoted to true arts in the first 3 books than this entire book combined."
1,Piers never stooped so low...,"Bought this book used and it was still overpriced. The time I spent reading it was priceless compared to the completely inane ""blathering"". As others have said, the sex isn't even sexy. At least the wife-swapping showed some unusual relationship-type intereaction. What a boring, bizarre story. Somebody spank Piers and put him back in the land of Xanth!"
1,I'm Sorry I Bought It,"This book was one of a number that I took along on a month long vacation that included plenty of time for reading... and I was NOT able to finish it. While I found much in it that was offensive (and I am generally open-minded), that wasn't what kept me from finishing it. Two-thirds of the way into the book, it still wasn't interesting. I'm surprised I kept with it as long as I did."
5,Spirit of Adventure,This is an incredible album. Kim's violin technique is nothing short of phenomenal and the music is grand. Sadly you don't get to hear the Suite Sierra. Last Waltz in Bodie is simply chilling. There's a broad range of music here and it will move and shake you.
2,partially the same as Tattoo traditions of Hawai'i,"partially the same as Tattoo traditions of Hawai'i, a few images, nothing new or not known before"
1,Worthless junk,"We ordered a replacement toner cartridge for our older Sharp copier. When the package came, we noticed the tape on the box was yellowed, suggesting it was old. When we opened the toner box, there was black toner powder everywhere, even outside of the protective bag. Upon removing the cartridge from the bag, powder continued to fall and when we inserted it into the copier, even more fell out on the floor and copier. I don't know if you've ever tried to clean up that powder, but it's next to impossible to get it all. Needless to say, the cartridge did not work AT ALL!!!! We then had to box it up and return it. And since we had to order another cartridge, we had to do without our copier for another 5 days. And I still haven't gotten credit for this yet either."
5,A Jimmy Buffett-esque sound.....,"This has the steel drum sound, a little harmonica here and there, and gives this CD a sound and direction Buffett fans like. Mostly upbeat, happy lyrics that will sound great at the beach (or here in the winter, when you long for the hot beach sun). An enjoyable disc. I only wish Jimmy would go back in this direction! For the time being though, this will do."
4,Better than expected,"I had heard some of these artists on Radio Margaritaville, so when I came across this cd, I snagged it, if only for the novelty factor. I was pleasantly surprised with the overall consistant quality of the music. I played this cd for a boat full of 35 Windjammer Cruise aficionados and it was a monster hit with them.Volume II continues as a quality compilation."
2,Disappointing Coconut Country Music,"I bought this based on Amazon recommendations. I don't mean to bash the musicians or those who like this CD so much, but if you don't like Jimmy Buffet music, chances are you won't like this (IMHO). I love Carribean music, especially reggae and cuban, and I like some Buffet. But I found that there is way too much country influence in this music for my taste. If you like Jimmy Buffet, you'll love this CD. If not, don't bother."
5,Don't listen to previous review!!!,"I had this cd a few yrs back before it got stolen and was won of thee best I had. It first came out in 96 and is amazingly timeless. Mr C came up with the phrase ""tech-house"" and this truly signifies that to the T! Not only the best tech-house mix out there, but probably one of the best mixes, period."
1,Worst Album of Das EFX's career..,"Man..I didn't buy this but dwnld it for a minute first..Just to listen to it, this album is not Das Efx. What ever happened coming after each other's verses quick and swiftly? Just putting a bunch of nice punchlines in a verse, I didn't get that on Generation EFX..It was just TOO laidback, they were only 3 songs I like on this album. Other songs are just not moving me. Even the album after this was WORST! I wish they went back to their style back in the 90's..."
3,Nappy Headed Underground Rappers on the Scene,"Das keeps it realistic on this LP from '98, although they disappoint with a few tracks mostly everything here is suitable for the sewer. The production is pretty dirty done by 8*Off Aguilar, Rashad Smith(Woo Ha!), and Parrish Smith and the rhymes still make you wanna rock the ruff stuff.The ruff stuff here is Shine and Make Noize. Turn it up and Burn it Up!"
3,this cd iight,when i first heard this cd it was with my kuzin. i had to buy it right away. when i bought tha whole cd i was disappointed cuz i found out there were only a couple tight songs on it (rap scholar wit redman (numba 7) and numba 12. from peeping other reviews i heard this was their worst cd but to me its pretty tight.
2,Disappointing,"I liked Das-Efx's previous albums, but this one didn't cut it. The ""Eye of the Tiger"" sample on the title track is laughable. Rap Scholar is a decent single, but the rest of the album is weak."
5,there the only artists to keep there own style .,I give the album five stars because the album is very creative. The lyrics are tight and make sense not like other artists that don't make sense in there rhymes. Drazy and brooks are the nicest battellers to go back and forth on a mic.
4,"Like the size, cord is too short","I am an adult, but actually like the smaller size of this mouse much better than the bigger mice out there. However, the length of the cord is ridiulously short, so I have to use an extension cable, which frequently gets unhooked accidentally. If it wasn't for that it would be the perfect basic, no frills mouse for me :)"
3,Nice but cord to short,This item is cute for kids and fits their hands. But the cord is way to short and it is hard to connect it to the computer.
2,Too Small!,This mouse is really cool. But only for kids. It is too small for grown up hands to use. I wish they had listed the specifications before I bought it.
2,Wrong song-list on Amazon.com 1/09,Confusing product description. Celestial Harmonies has two different releases called Magnum Mysterium I--one is a 1987 single disc release and one is a 1993 double disc release. And both have the same cover art. I had the single disc 1987 release but it got damaged so I was looking to replace it. When I checked the Amazon.com product description page on the 1993 double disc release it only listed the same songs from the single disc and nothing from Disc #2. So I thought that I would be getting the same songs as the original single disc plus another disc of music of the same genre that would be a surprise. WRONG! The ENTIRE songlists from the two releases is totally different. Quite deceptive. And I like the 1987 songs a whole lot better. I'm not a choral music connoisseur but I would recommend the Sacred Treasures (I and III) release if you are looking for choral music to meditate with.
4,Could Not Put This One Down,"I loved this book!! Its was a great read, and it kept me wanting more! I just purchased this about 3 days ago.. I don't normaly ready that fast, being a busy mom. lol"
2,Depressing,"The book is just ""okay"". The characters didn't feel real to me. It was hard to imagine the story line and some of the secondary characters might have made the book better except the stars of the book rode around the countryside the entire time."
3,Wasn't My Favorite,"I wanted to like this book because I love getting into a new series, but it just didn't grab me like I was hoping it would. It felt like it took a really long time to get started, and then wound down too quickly. That said, it was well written and had very few errors."
1,How Did This Get Published?!?,"Wow, the writing in this book is so stiff and boring that I am struggling to get through four chapters. Don't waste your money."
4,Charming of the Shrew,"Love the Irish, Scottish and Celtic setting. Good escape from the modern world. Will recommend to others who share the love of the historical and past romances"
3,Fairly forgettable.....,"I wanted to like this book, wanted to like the main characters but neither was very well written. The male lead was all over the place with his feelings and the heroine was just difficult to stomach. The book went around and around the same issues over and over again until I was only reading the book to get to the end. There wasn't a lot of angst, not a lot of butterflies in the stomach. I know this book received really good reviews but I found it forgettable and not worth my time. I left three stores for A. an original plot, B. good dialogue, C. somewhat believable events."
4,This was pretty good.,"This was pretty good. It was a fast, easy read & I enjoyed the interactions of the characters. There weren't really any twists or turns or unexpected events to make it a book I couldn't put down."
5,Charming the Shrew,"I love historical romance and can never get enough. I have never read any other books by Laurin Wittig until now and enjoyed all of them (The Legacy of the MacLeod).If you like Midevil then this book is for you.I have put Laurin Wittig on my list of favored authors. The only complaint I have, each book in the series should be numbered so anyone would know which book comes first. Enjoy"
3,"Fine, but should really only show up in the romance section","This book is a typical, predictable, fluffy romance novel that happens to be set in the past. It is clearly written for a female audience. If you are looking for something a bit sexy, click buy. If you are looking for something challenging and educational, a true historical fiction with a complex meaty plot, keep looking..."
2,Returned after 1 hour,Bought because it was a special for .99 and returned it for a refund. Bored after trying to read after 1 hour...I'm addicted to Highland romances and couldn't wait to return it for a refund. Devil of Kilmartin much better book.
1,Poor Clan MacLeod,"Didnt read this book for a few reasons:1)Celtic design on the front. MacLeod's are a Norse clan. Please wiki before you write.2)MacLeods already had to deal with the Highlander, why do this to us?3)Why would you do something as silly as merging what is essentially taming of the shrew and some sort of intrigue novel? MacLeods dont do intrigue, we arent that bright. Also we wouldnt marry our daughters out to men with feelings. So the plot is just too far fetched.I couldnt read more than 2 pages because it was so maddening seeing the clan used for these ends. Please, next time make a MacDonald based book."
4,"she runs away from a marriage, meets unknown man who does not tell her who he is","She is to marry ugly, ""dog face McDonnell"" whom she hates. Tries to get to aunt's place- gets lost. Is rescued by a handsome man. He learns who she is but dos not tell her who is because he has a reputation for charming the ladies. She must learn to trust him and avoid her brothers and dog face."
3,None,great love story with good intrigue and different plot. typical ending but still worth passing the time on a rainy day.
3,Charming the Shrew,Not one I enjoyed as much? I do recommend to those that love Highlanders. I read this book out of sequence which very well could have changed my enjoyment.
4,A little predictable but.....,"aren't most of these type novels? I enjoyed the writing style. I found it very easy to just follow the plot and enjoy ithe book for the fun of reading. I don't think you have to learn huge life lessons from everything you read. It should be fun and this book was! And who doesn't want to conger up a big, handsome Scot in their mind every once in a while. I also enjoy reading books that have sequels building on lesser characters. When I finished ""Charming the Shrew"" I was ready to move on to the next book in the saga ""Daring the Highlander"" which was equally as good and followed on the heels of it nicely."
3,I liked this book!,"the charactors were great. There was plenty of intrigue. Also there was romance that did not disappoint! I liked this book, the hero definately was fighting his attraction to the shrew!"
1,'Mills and Boon' Scottish Period Piece,"So predictable as to be tedious. If you like Mills and Boon type dramas, then you might like this one I suppose - it has all the essential ingredients: the extremely handsome 'laird', the beautiful and difficult 'princess' style character, the evil brother, the dastardly fiancé... and a chase across wild and windswept scottish highlands!"
2,Don't use your credit card; order this subscription pack,"Don't use your credit card to subsript to the online WSJ, or your credit card info will be kept on their web site(even after the transcation) and you will be bound by the contract for renewal. To get off the contract, you have to make a personal call to the customer service. It is a shame for such a prestigious business journal to take this porn site approach.I have been reading the WSJ for more than 10 yrs, and I notice a recent drop of quality in its articles. (research/foreign staff cut?)Because of that, I no longer read the WSJ daily. I turn to the Business Week for weekly summary, and the McKinesy Quarterly Review and the Harvard Business Review for more business reading.The online WSJ used to be a nice companion to the printed version while I was on the road. But the new design of the online WSJ web site is so difficult to use and confusing that now I'll just watch CNBC/CNN fn in the hotel room instead."
1,The WSJ had gone the way of Fox News,"I subscribed to this paper for 25 years and finally cancelled after reading too many Karl Rove rants on the op-ed page. The paper has become what everyone feared when Murdock bought it. The great reporting is essentially gone, and the paper is filled with trivia or biased political stories. While they make mention of Murdoch's troubles in Britain for illegal activities, the treatment is mild. I moved to the NY TImes, something I should have done years ago.BTW before cancelling the paper I inquired about getting it online only. Would cost $10 per month for both paper and online and $18 without paper. Wouldn't budge, just told me to buy the dou and tell them to donate the paper."
1,WHAT A DISASTER SINCE THE CHANGES!!!,"As a subscriber to online WSJ for over 2 years I have reviewed the changes to the site and have come to the following conclusions:1. The new site is cluttered.2. The new site has terrible, distracting colors.3. The new site is disorganized, with way too many bells, whistles, features, and options.4. The new site does not allow me to read the WSJ paper the night before, with the same simple layout as printed copy, therefore, rendering it useless to me.5. The old site was much better, both easier to navigate & read.6. Without a ""classic"" feature, which simply allows me to read the same paper as the printed copy, with a similar layout as was previously available, I will cancel the online service.7. I read the discussion boards. I am in the majority. THE NEW SITE STINKS!Mark PorterWest Chicago, IL"
2,SLOW NEWS IN A FAST PACED WORLD,"The Wall Street Journel invented and is still the best at fair and balenced reporting , inspite of what fox news may think. They have great writers who care and if they edit your comments it is only to allow space for it to fit. In short this is the only American news company that can be trusted on a day to day basis. So this begs the question , why do I only give them 2 stars. Thier front page news stories are brought out to slow to be of value if the story has time value. It is still a great paper (web site) if in todays fast paced world you can find time for it. Dow Jones Market Watch ( same company ) is a better site for up to the minuite finacial information and it is free."
1,"Can't ""ship"" it overseas","I tried to buy this package but in the ordering process was told that since I'm in New Zealand, the item cannot be ""shipped"" to my destination. Any system that maladroit deserves to choke on its own emissions -- and while it's probably more a reflection on Amazon than the Journal, someone at the paper should be more awake to these sorts of issues."
1,Price increase 50%,"I just noticed that my $99 annual online subscription was increased to $150 plus tax. My credit card was automatically billed for this. I knew the renewal was going to take place, but was unaware of the 50% boost in cost! I cannot do anything about it this time, but will not renew and think that their no refund policy is very anti-consumer. I know of no other periodical that has that policy."
1,"Beware of auto renewal scheme, lousy customer service","I was a happy camper until I received a surprise $99 WSJ charge on my credit card with no prior notice. Customer service said it was ""in my contract"", that I get auto renewals at whatever the going rate is. They refused to cancel/refund the overpriced additional year under any circumstances."
1,Another auto-renew warning,"To echo to the sentiments expressed before me, I am highly disappointed the flagrant WSJ price increase that they throw at you with auto-renew and then refuse to remove. My $99 annual subscription renewed yesterday for $197. Yes, it doubled in price. While I understand that the media industry is down on its knees, I would like to think that such a venerable publication would have a bit more integrity than to blindside its customers like that."
2,Wall Street Journal Renewal is a Rip-Off,"My online membership had expired and my account file noted that the rate was $99. SO I updated my account information to renew via credit card. Wel-l-l-l.......when I checked my statement, I had been billed for $155!! That is a 57% increase over last year!! I'm shocked, dismayed, and disgusted. So I called them and told them to CANCEL MY ACCOUNT. That is a usurious rate, I don't see how they can justify it. Particularly ONLINE!! When I told the rep that my account information showed the rate at $99 for renewal, he assured me that it was last year's rate, and that the current rate was $155. NO THANKS!"
3,Don't use your credit card,"If you want to subscribe to WSJ, like the other reviewer said, order it and don't use your credit card. I made the mistake of using my credit card and they have no easy way to cancel your subscription. I made a personal call to cancel this. Well...even then they went ahead and debited my credit card. I had to make another call to cancel this. What a shame."
1,Wall Street Journal Charging Double,"I purchase Wall Street Journal content for my Kindle. They want to charge me double if I want the exact same content on a different machine. I do not think this is fair. To me, it's like the newspaper charging you for a subscription but you can only read it in your living room. If you want to move to the kitchen, they would charge you again. I called, e-mailed, and online posted comments and have received no comments from them.Has anyone else run into this problem?"
2,50% subscription increase,"my subscription was $99/yr and is due to expire in June 2009. They are raising the rate 50% to $149, which they described as a ""bit of an increase."""
2,Can't stop charges,"You can only order the e-version by credit card. I gave them a credit card that would expire prior to my next renewal and surprise the WSJ managed to put thru a charge anyway. As stated in the other reviews there is nothing in the site labeled cancel subscription. So once they have your number- watch out, unless you are willing to spend a LONG LONG time on the PHONE (i.e. not computer) trying to get your charges reversed. I personally believe both items are purposeful, only taking a charge card and then offering no on line method to cancel the subscription. Customer service is a JOKE!!!!"
1,Yet another auto-renewal victim!,"Well, victim may be a somewhat strong term, but I, like many others here, was auto-renewed at a higher rate ($129 in my case) and am stuck with the charge. Yes, I'm sure it's half my fault (I probably deleted the warning e-mail as spam), but I'm not a rich guy, so a charge like that one stings. I'll be darn sure there'll be no future renewals, and the only way I'll read the WSJ after this expires is in the local library. Shame on them, and me."
2,Horrible Customer Service,"I have been a subscriber of WSJ online since the beginning (over 10 years), and recently got an unexpected 20% increase in the annual renewal rate ($120) put on my AE card. I love the Journal, and read it every day, but 20% was enough to make me rethink my subscription. I called to cancel, and couldn't get through after 3 tries and long waits. After reading here I find I am stuck with the renewal. I then went to cancel my CC which was not possible. This reminds me of the old AOL which made it impossible to cancel their service. I never received notice of the price increase, and now know they are deceiving their customers. WSJ is a great online newspaper, but it appears they are now being run by dishonest folks. Contractors, I suspect. You have been warned so be careful giving them your CC #. I will have my CC number changed, and will keep trying to cancel my renewal which is in May of 2009. I will not subscribe again unless I can do it without a CC#."
2,Greenline Greenhouse,"While I was impressed with the packaging and speed of delivery that was the end of my satisfaction. The greenhouse is very cheaply constructed and unless you are 4 feet tall total useless without an extention to the base. It took just over 3 hours to assemble and this includes going to the hardware store to replace the cheap aluminum screws they sent, 8 of them broke while tightening and of course there where no extras sent. The panels used are of the cheapest plastic known to man, you would think for this price they would be double pane but nooooo. Avoid this RION GREENLINE or RION HOBBY Greenhouse, unless you buy it for $99.00. That's what it is worth."
4,Rion backyard greenhouse,Seems to be well designed and of good quality. Assembly bolts very soft aluminum that easily break if tightened too much or loosened and retightened. Stainless steel bolts would be a better choice. No spare bolts or screws included in kit so if some are damaged or broken you have to go buy replacements. Assembly time somewhat longer than anticipated as there are many small parts. Instructions easier to follow than many other products I have put together.Everything fit OK and so far the greenhouse has worked well as temps dropped into mid 20s. A very small ceramic heater has kept temps in the 40s and 50s on it's lowest setting.An attractive small greenhouse for the price.
3,Why did I buy this,"The shipping company that was used was very slow and in no hurry to deliver. They had it for 4 days and were only an hour in half away from my house. It took 12 hrs to build, by my husband, who usually can knock things out with a few hours to spare. It is nice to look. There are no spare parts, 2 things were broken upon arrival and we waited another week for the spare parts to arrive. Some of the strips do not fit right and have to be trimmed down to size. Screws are aluminum, very fragile. Shipping is $50 and tax around $50. So add that to the price. The overall quality is not worth mentioning. For the price, you can build a bigger, better, double paned greenhouse with materials from your hardware store."
1,Looks nice but beware of the windows!,"This greenhouse looks nice however the plastic strips that hold the windows in are difficult to secure properly and will pop-out when the wind blows or the sun heats them up so they curl-up and come out. We contacted the company and they sent more strips which I decided to ""glue"" into place with my caulking gun and some clear silicone. It was still difficult to get all the windows secure. We finally took the thing apart and returned it."
5,Fairy tale magic,"Glass-Slipper-dot.com is a delightful retelling of the classic Cinderella story. Ms. Anderson's characters became like friends and their dilemmas tugged at my heart. By the end, I wished for my own personal fairy godmother. This is a special story with an uplifting message to share."
5,As Good As It Gets,"I bought this album solely based on the fact that Rebekah was at Lilith Fair. i had never heard her music before, and I was really missing out. She blends pop, rock, and funk to attain an awesome sound. Songs like ""Love Trap"" and ""Be Your Own"" are simply irresistible. Once you hear them you can't stop listening to them. I really want to hear her live and I am blown away by the lack of publicity for her. She is far better than Alana Davis, yet we all know ""32 Flavors"", but not any of Rebekah's music. Too bad. Keep going girl!"
5,unbelieveable,"When i first heard his songs in my boyfriend's car, i just couldn't believe my ears.................... Thank you, Joe. Thank you for introducing me the best music in the world."
3,"Stereo SACD, not Multichannel!","This is a great performance. My review is mostly based on the fact that this is a stereo SACD, not multichannel. I am learning more about SACD every day, but was very disappointed that it is only presented in stereo."
5,I am very happy to get this SACD,"In japan,The SACD version is not on sale.I find this SACD in USA amazon site,and buy it.I can get this SACD ,so I am very happy.Thank you."
5,beautiful watch,"My husband likes watches a lot. He is constantly buying. Arrived on time, good quality I will buy again to this seller.We bought 4 watches, but this one has really good price and looks very nice"
3,Cheap feeling,I previously reviewed the 72915 field watch that is mostly canvas and rated it higher because it is slightly more comfortable to wear. The size and color of this watch are exactly what I wanted but I thought that a watch that retails about double what it costs on amazon would feel better. I wear the 72915 every day to work and it has become softer and I hope that the more opportunities I have to wear this dressier watch it will soften as well and not be nearly as irritating to my wrist. These watches are still great values for the money and are much more suitably sized than a lot of dive watches I see other Recruits wearing.
1,Bummer,"I purchased this watch for my father for Christmas. It started losing time within the first week. He is able to reset it, but then soon after will soon lose time again. We have exchanged it, hoping this next watch will work out better! We shall see, the other reviews are making me feel that we may be returning it all together. Hopefully we get lucky with this new one!"
4,Keeps excellent time!,"This watch has not lost a second in over a month! I orignally ordered a Wenger 62910-16908 and it didn't work when I received it. The Wenger 72900 is listed as 38mm crown, but it is the same watch as the 62910-16908 which is listed as a 41mm. Thusly, the 72900 is a large watch! I would much prefer a 38mm, but considering the quality of the watch, very nice leather band and and the excellent time keeping, I'll give this 4 stars."
4,"Great watch, band is still a little stiff and squeaky","The Classic Field White Dial watch is a terrific watch. It's got a nice heft, but not excessive, and the numbers are enormous and (as I found out when the power went out) glow in the dark. Plus it's a very attractive watch -- it looks twice the price. Simplicity is an underrated asset, I have a beautiful Tag that is so over-complicated I can barely read it in bright light.But it does have one flaw: the leather band. It's really stiff, has wrist-adjustment holes that are a little too far apart, and squeaks when I adjust it, a sign of cheap leather. I'll probably end up replacing it.Some part of me wants to say, what do you expect, it was a $75 watch? But, come on. It's a great watch. It deserves a great band."
1,Does not run,"I purchased this watch at a discount store and right out of its box it did not run. I took it to awatch repair company and they determined the battery was good but said the ""second hand had beeninstalled too tightly"". They got the watch to run, but said if it stops within the next few daysreturn it. It did stop running and was returned to the store for full credit."
4,Wenger Swiss Military Men's,"It's a very fine product, I hope it will be good lasting, because it just arrived and i haven't tried yed!"
2,It's too big,Measurement of watch sizes is not exactly rocket science. I chose this watch based on the published size and it is way to big. I won't order any watches on line unless there is a better way to determine the size.
3,Unquiet mind,"I 'painfully' got thru this book. Having read 'An Unquiet Mind' I was looking forward to some insights from a brilliant person. But, there was no thesis, just repetition of same points supported by out of context 'quotes galore' In essence the author 'was all over the place' and I couldn't help but think she wrote it in a 'manic' state. I know that sounds awful, but I think I needed a dictionary for every other paragraph and I thought I had knowledge of the english language. It reminded me of my graduate school days where I would get so carried away collecting research that I had lost sight of my original thesis. Having a manic-depressive personality, not unlike the author, it was uncomfortable reading this book. I came away with the knowledge that brilliant minds can also have low points, or that scientists and health professsionals are passionate about their work. Ah duh. I think that point was made 112 times! Sorry to be so negative but I hate having false hopes on a book."
5,real sense of life,"EXHUBERANCE: THE PASION FOR LIFE, MAKE US THINK ABOUT THE FEW HUMAN POSITIVE SPIRITS FULL OF VITALITY THAT GIVE THE REST OF US TRUE LESSONS TO LIVE, AS A CONTRAST WITH THE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ONES THAT DEMAND ALL THE ATTENTION FROM US..........GUILLERMO SEPULVEDA"
4,Self-Analysis Tool,We all have times when we feel down about life and just can't get out of the rut.
2,Repetitive and boring,"This is a scientific approach (sort of) to the study of the state of 'exuberance'. It includes a great deal of detail about famous people who have exhibited exuberance. The first few examples are interesting -- then the book becomes boring and repetitive.She concludes that exuberance is something you either have or don't. And here is an entire book of descriptions of those who have it.Exuberance is good -- in the beginning of the book. Just look at what these people who have it accomplished. Then she links exuberance to mania, and describes (again famous) people who were manic (or manic-depressive).The last part of the book is rather depressing -- discussing famous people (or characters from famous fiction) who were bipolar.This is not a self-help book. You're either exuberant or not. And, if you are on either end of the exuberance scale, there's nothing you can do about it."
4,Not All Original but Good,"Some of the selections on this album were popularized by Ronnie Milsap but others were made famous by people like Jim Reeves. Whether they are his or borrowed, however, they are all well done. The selections suit Milsap's style of voice and the instrumentation is well done.I would not say that this would be a definitive Milsap album but it does showcase his talent. It's a good job."
5,LYRICAL EXCITEMENT,"The lyrical prose of, In the Biblical Sense, gushed from the pages and showered me with the sweet excitement of new love. When my girlfriend shared her copy of the book with me, I was skeptical because formula romance books are not my idea of a good read. However, I was pleasantly surprised! Finally, an author who took the time and effort to create a classy romantic adventure filled with passionate, flavorful characters. Each chapter is introduced with provocative headings and thoughtful quotes that prepare the reader to be dazzled. The fast paced lyrical prose intrigued me to the point where I am now hooked on this outstanding writing style (even the astonishing way the book was brought to an end). Yes, I did buy my own copy and recommend that all lovers of a quality romance novel do the same. A one of a kind great novel!"
2,"A very basic, primitive stereo camera","Both the camera and the enclosed viewer are very primitive, cheaply made devices. A non-stereo film camera like this sells for about $5. Everything in it is manual, including film rewind, the optics are made of cheap plastic, the pictures produced lack sharpness and clarity. The so-called viewer is made of paper, lenses ar made of some kind of cellophane-like plastic.It's unfortunate that camera manufacturers have neglected the field of stereo photography. Humans have both two ears and two eyes, don't they? Why then stereo sound technologies are so advanced today, while stereo visual technologies are nearly abandoned?"
4,verrrrry interesteeeen,"Ken Ishii played a very cool set, the track selection was superb, the mixing was unique.... he's a hard person to pigeon-hole as a specific type of dejay, that's what he thrives on!"
3,Heavy Reading,"This book was difficult to read. I read scholarly books all the time, but this was one of the worst. Many of the historical descriptions were merely speculations as there is no fact to base it upon. While I did find this an interesting look into both slave and Cherokee life, I had to force myself to keep reading. It was more frustrating than enlightening. I had to read pages multiple times to pick fact from speculation as the distinction is not always clear."
5,Guitar Heaven,"While I may not appreciate the Drum and Bass section (need to get back to acoustic drums and a simple 6 string bass), this album demonstrates that the guitar knows no bounds in the proper hands.Fripp is properly legendary (he must be pushing 60?) he plays with more prowess and speed than.. anyone. And his technological grasp has advanced the guitar light years.But this album is mostly Belew's. Adrian Belew just blows the doors off the car and the contraceptive sponge out of Grandma. An amazing display of guitar pyrotechnics that never leaves harmony far behind.The interplay between Fripp and Belew is awe inspiring. This 3 disc set, much like Fripp's League of Gentlemen, will be a permanent part of my stereo system."
4,The Further Construkction of Light..,"Beast! Beast, I say! This album isn't for the easily traumatized - keep away any small children. The current KC has evolved into a real monster on the road and they're taking no prisoners. ""Prozac Blues"" sounds even better without the altered vocals, ""FraKctured"" will shake some windows, and Dave Bowie's ""Heroes"" never had this much energy before. This isn't to say it's all heavy metal - ""Cage"" is slowed down to a moody jazz piece, and ""Deception of the Thrush"" soars into space. Simply heavenly.Ah, but Crimson fans probably have most of these songs already. Hence the inclusion of disk 3 - an hour of improvisations from various shows. If you're not sure whether to pop for the whole set, don't hesitate. This is some of the most far-out, ingenious improvising you'll ever hear. A Crimson fan's dream. This band is truly a force to be reckoned with.."
3,Grounded?,"Maybe. But the graphics are excellent. Best RTS ever? No way! While it has its moments, it also has its problems. Again, graphics are terrific. Some of the units are cool, but some of the air units they have can't attack anything, so why have them! The missions are a joke for the most part. I played this game for 3 days totaling about 8 hours and beat 14 missions. A little too easy if you ask me. The screen movement is alot like Myth, it ... . Its tough to find a good line of sight and you can't get a good look at the battles going on because if move in too close, then you miss getting attacked somewhere else. Plus they have a bunch of icons all over the screen that block your view. The music is also good. The cinematics were good as was the story. I expected a little more from a Sierra product especially after Half-life. Overall, I did enjoy the game. I would have liked it more if it was a little harder. Kinda of stinks to spend that kind of money for such an easy game."
2,A documentary recommended only to a few,"I saw a noble family trying to lead a normal life by renewing their house (that currently hosts a Ministry), getting married, talking about their infancy at the sound of bomb strikes as if nothing were happening around them - even though at the end we see the main heroin breaking down omitting she can't take it anymore.However, I should make a big effort watching it again since it was too slow to attend and I had to struggle trying to understand their sayings, half french - half english at the sound of bombs.In no way do I try to reduce the value of such a documentary...however I would recommend it only to the ones who would be interested in observing what I was, therefore the life of a lebanese family (even though we cannot say the Bustros family was a middle-class one) during the savage civil war. And this is actually what I got..."
2,"Horrid sound, tedious content","I was hoping for something better. The soundtrack is nearly inaudible, and everyone speaks with thick accents. So, you are straining to understand what they are saying, which really isn't very interesting after all. You hear gunfire and shells bursting in the background constantly, while they lounge about their downtown Beirut mansion. A struggle to watch."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"If you HAVE to get this movie, the best way to view it is in Fast Forward. My father and I forced ourselves through about an hour's worth & really just wanted to gauge our eyes out. Documentary of a ridiculous, wealthy Lebanese family who have no sense of proportion and reality.I would not have given it any stars, if I were allowed."
3,Disappointed,"I found the first stories in this book somewhat dull. But the Pope of the Chimps on page 97, it began to be more interesting. Then, from Written in Blood on page 149, I enjoyed the remaining stories very much. Although Arthur C. Clarke is one of my favorite authors, I thought that his story called The Star didn't quite match the other stories in the book. They are concerned with the struggle of science against superstition and The Star seemed to me to be the other way around."
3,"Not as good as Take It Like a Man, but has its moments","I think a lot of Lisa's talents is in her timing and facial gestures, her Jersey Italian accent, and her overconfident expression of antiquated stereotypes. That's all part of her shtick and she does it in a way that's not genuinely offensive except to the very sensitive. But maybe because the venue was simply too large and it wasn't as easy for her to interact with her crowd, that Dirty Girl just wasn't as funny as Take It Like a Man.It's a pity Take It Like a Man and her roasts of people like Pamela Anderson and Flava Flav have propelled her to a level of fame that she sells out huge theaters instead of the smaller nightclubs where her act excels, and where you can easily see her expressive face complementing her biting wit."
4,No Political Correctness Here,"Coarse, profane and hilarious. Lisa insults everyone and doesn't tiptoe around any issue. Even if you find her language and subject matter offensive --- it is so nice to hear someone speak with no politically correct tones."
4,Dirty girl is Dirty!,"I bought these because I love her as a comic and she did not let me down with these two DVD's. I listen to her on Howard Stern when she is on and wish she would be on a lot more that she is. I just happend to be in California after watching these and she was there at the community center. If it wasn't for these DVD's, I don't think I could have ever got my wife to go watch her. She is great live and she is great on DVD. I highly reccommend it."
5,Lisa Lampanelli is a Dirty Girl!,"Lisa's humor is not for the PC crowd. If you have the ability to laugh about your life, you will not be able to hold it in at this hilarious take on insulting everyone and everything. Lisa deomonstrates that if people are truly not racist, homophobic or sexist, then they should be able to laugh at the stupidity of these insults."
2,DULL DULL DULL,Oh dear what a disapointment !I loved lisa's first DVD but this was dull and unfunny . There didn't seem to be enough material to fill out an hour so its padded out with old old jokes and way too much crowd interaction .The queen of mean trots out the same tired racist stereotypes but does nothing to subvert them .It all seems shopworn and tired . AVOID
1,Not Funny and full of racist stereotypes,This DVD was more about insulting the audience with racist and rude remarks. Lisa Lampanelli has more talent than she displayed in this concert. Do not waste your money.
5,excellent cd,I have been to Yemen and have listened to music of this country. The recording presented in this cd contains original traditionnal Yemenite music which is friendly not only to fans of pure ethnic music but to every tasteful listener. The quality of the recording is very good and the booklet included is a treasure itself. Congatulations to the producers and artists.
1,bahh where the true testimonial?,"there nothing worse than seeing your heros mix with substandard fill ins to create a commerical waste of space, real fans want the real testimonial now- see the real band in pixelated glory on youtube and save your money until the true testomonial is released and not bootlegs selling for over a hunderd dollars,"
2,A botched attempt,"This concert performance is plagued by uneven sound, an uneven performance and more than a few missing songs. By reading the liner notes there were more songs recorded for this DVD, but somehow they didn't manage to make the final cut. The notes say technical problems, but judging by the performances it could very well be that the MC5 was so bad that they couldn't use the footage.It's shame this legendary band didn't record one of its current American shows for a DVD. That group was more well-rehearsed, but either touring group doesn't live up to the MC5's legendary status.The extras on this DVD are good to watch once. Other than that they provide no extended commentary on the history of the band."
3,Too preachy,"I have always enjoyed this series by Jane Haddam, but this novel was a diappointment. It was crammed with repetitive social commentary, to the point of excess. The story and characters are good, but it would of been half its length if more editing was done. Almost every character lectures the reader at some point, either liberal or conservative."
2,"No suspense, too many characters","I genuinely like Jane Haddam, but she should have listened to fate when her computer crashed and she retrieved this manuscript only with hi-tech intervention. It took fifty pages before Gergor Demarkian made an appearance--and in those pages one character after another was introduced. The narrative meadered without direction through most of the book. There were tons of social commentary and almost no plot. This novel may be more literary than mystery, but even so, it was very slow going. In fact, it ground to a halt for me many times. I feel it was her least successful effort to date. I hope the author uses some careful plot development next time and focuses on Demarkian."
2,Superdrag makes a change for the worse...,"If your gonna buy a Superdrag CD, buy Regretfully Yours, because this one is not worth your time or money. Superdrag is awesome and they really are a unique band, but Head Trip is a major disappointment. On this CD the band tries to be creative and make some different sounding music, but the whole CD is just extremely dull and repetitive. One shouldn't expect a band to make the same kind of music on every album, however, this album is just ridiculous. It's definitely a step in the wrong direction and lacks that sound that made them stand out from other bands on their last CD. Don't bother with this one."
2,Superdrag Takes a Step Backwards,"If your gonna buy a Superdrag CD, buy Regretfully Yours, because this one is not worth your time or money. Superdrag is awesome and they really are a unique band, but Head Trip is a major disappointment. On this CD the band tries to be creative and make some different sounding music, but the whole CD is just extremely dull and repetitive. One shouldn't expect a band to make the same kind of music on every album, however, this album is just ridiculous. It's definitely a step in the wrong direction and lacks that sound that made them stand out from other bands on their last CD. Don't bother with this one."
5,Expanding your Ears,"Without a doubt this album is in my top ten and has been since I heard it 10 years ago. It stands the test of time. Superdrag has been catagorized as power pop and I guess that's close enough. They offer a perfect blend of noise and melodic songwriting. If you've never heard them this is a great place to start. It shows Superdrag with their lushest orchestrations. But the orchestrations aren't so lush that you will want to break somebody's violin. The lyrics are top notch, heartfelt. The type you can embrace whole-heartedly, with melodies that will make it hard not to sing along with. I could name standout songs but the truth is there isn't a bad one in the bunch...I guess my three favorites are Bankrupt Vibration, I'm Expanding My Mind and She Is A Holy Grail.When the album is over you might be left scratching your head wondering why this wasn't a smash hit because this is an extremely accessible album...this is how top 40 radio should sound."
2,I loved Regretfully Yours......,But this cd is very boring. Every song follows the same style. None of them are very explorative at all. They all start out by having one simple little beat repeated over and over...then there is a chorus...then the simple little beat over and over. Maybe the first song is a little different and Amphetamine..but the rest of this cd is one of the most boring listens in recentyears.
1,Very poor,I have seen Stacey spin live many times. He is execellent. This CD however is not. I am not sure what he was trying to do here. It sounds like he did not even try. bab bad bad.
5,Stacey Pullen!!!,"This CD is AWESOME, still one of my favorites after many years! This music will make you want to move and jump around, I just don't get it someone let this CD collect dust?! Not at this house!"
5,Dakota Moon ....Shining Stars!,I 've just had the great pleasure of being introduced to Dakota Moons' music by the brother of Ty Taylor! This cd exudes talent and passion. Violet and Sing You To Sleep are my favorites as well as the hidden cut after the 13th song. Dakota Moon has a new cd coming out in July. I can't wait!
4,Yeah for authenticity!,"I've had the CD for about two months, and I play it just about everyday. It is fantastic. I didn't care for the James Taylor remake, but ""A Promise I Make"" and ""Violet"" justifiably compensates for it. These brothas are ""all that and a bag of chips."" This will definitely be a pleasant gift for a couple of unsuspecting friends of mine this year."
5,Dakota Moon by Dakota Moon,Dakota Moon's voices/harmonies are so pure and fluid. One of the best CD's I've ever owned. PHENOMENAL! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,I heard this group overseas..,"I can't believe they are not more popular over here! Every song has great harmony, style and instrumentation. If you get a chance...listen!"
4,not what i expected,"I learned of Ty Taylor from watching Rockstar INXS, and based on the reviews i was expecting an album of more of a rock persuasion. This is NOT a rock album. This is more of an r&b album, it is mellow music. There is no doubt that the band has talent, and it is easy to listen to. But if like me, you were looking for something that displayed Ty Taylor's rock ability, this is probably not the album for you. To me it has a bit of a boy band feel, ballads and harmoies. It is a good album, but not what i expected and if i had actually heard the album before hand i probably would have opted for something else."
2,Ex-appointed,"First I was very exited when the bag arrived. It was very cute. However after carrying the bag for about a week with my schoolbooks enclosed, the straps began to tear away from the bag leaving holes where the straps connect to the bag. This was very disappointing since the reviews suggested that the bag could withstand a reasonable amount of weight. I would not recommend this for someone who plans to carry anything heavy!"
2,Not Jumbo enough for me,"This litter pan says it is a jumbo size, but it is far from it. The bottom is the same size of a traditional litter pan. The only jumbo to it, is that it is taller. I am not happy with it. I mean, it is great for a single cat, but not multiple ones. I wanted a litter pan that had alot of room for moving around, not just taller."
5,Big Box,This litter box is excellent if you have large cats. I have 2 that are over 22 lbs and they are long. Both cats can turn and have plent of room. Highly recommended.
4,Very useful tool,"I recently bought a pair and I keep finding uses for them: they are great for constant communication when working on field surveys; or trail hiking; or mountain biking; or on a road trip, you can use them from car to car; or on the shopping center. Of course, good reception distance varies with the obstacles between you and your partners, but that's normal."
2,Poor audio,"I bought these radio's as an upgrade to the Cobra FRS only that I had before. The range did improve - I have had as much as 2-3 miles car to car on the freeway.But the audio is poor. I normally place the radio in the center console and listen to the conversations from the caravan that I'm in. The Cobra was very good at this. But even with full volume, the Motorola needs to be held close to my ear and the audio quality is poor.I have used other people's older model FRS only Motorola's in the past and they were superior to my Cobra's. These are not in the same league. The quality is poor enough that I'm again looking for FRS/GMRS radio's - NON-Motorola."
3,"Quite good, but not as expected","I second to the poor audio quality, less than 500 meters in city. I like the VOX option, but wish that I did look for vibrating alert option in other models. Will try to sell them, and get better ones ( I think it is going to be Motorola as well)."
3,decent for price,"dont be fooled, this two-way radio doesnt exactly have a 5-mile range everywhere. its only 5 miles on open spaces, but in the mountains it gets pretty nasty. i used it when i went snowboarding in Colorado, and when my party split up to two sides of the mountain we couldnt hear each other anymore. its not a bad radio, but it doesnt have a 5-mile range as listed, but if you can get it for less than 35 bucks, then it might be worth it"
2,audio quality poor,"years ago I bought a motorola frs radio (fr 60?) and it worked great! I've purchased some recent radio and the sound quality (transmit and receive) is horrible. It's very hard for people to understand what's being said and much more difficult to communicate. People say the transmitter audio is too quiet and I have to speak up. And whether quiet or loud, it sounds garbled.I'm looking for a better one, probably not motorola. Too bad, I loved the older ones."
3,Good at short distances only,"These radios work really well at short distances, but at greater than a quarter mile the audio quality becomes terrible and you can hear a lot of interference. Another issue is that replacing the batteries constantly really increases the cost. I wish I had purchased a set with rechargeable lithium batteries and charging dock. I have another set of radios (Motorola EM1000R 20-Mile 2-Way radios) with the charging station and they are far superior to these."
4,clear and easy to use,"Only using them for a short distance, room to room inside, but they work fine. clear and easy to use. Like the 'code' feature so you know you are only talking to the intended recipient."
1,No reception,Purchased them for a cruise and upon receipt I did everything according to the setup and no reception. I wanted to return them but I have no idea how to for a refund. Please let me know how I can return them. Sincerely I wish they had worked
4,Great album,"This is a master accomplishment from a masterful singer. Highly recommended. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because Skraelings is so slow, while the rest really rock."
4,kevin fowler on XM radio,i was listening to XM satellite radio channel XM-12 when i heard this guy sing beer bait ammo. XM-12 plays artist such as kevin fowler who dont [polish apples]in nashville to get their songs played. it doesnt get any better than XM!!!!
5,Endless Use and Comfort!,"Its awesome to see the Pyramat Interactive sold on Amazon.(com)now since I bought my first one 3 years ago and use it all the time. Its portable which makes it perfect for watching TV, camping comforts, laying out in the sun while reading a book or just hanging out. Its extremely comfortable and withstands the beatings of everyday use. All of mine have kept really well."
5,Video Game Furniture Has Finally Arrived,"Wow! what a great piece of gaming furniture. This is the first piece of Video Game furniture I was able to get my hands on. Now finally I have the feel of a true arcade video game. I tried plenty of steering wheels for driving games. I use to jump off the couch and play dead when I died playing my Atari video games. And Oh Yeah I pretended that my ps/2 remote control made my body shake. But I do not have to lie to myself anymore. The Pyrmat Interactive is where it's at. With this comfortable, sleek piece of furniture you get the Arcade feel that you never had before. This household item is a must for anyone that is a True Gamer and not just a poser like I was before I bought the PYRMAT INTERACTIVE."
5,500 entries place sci fi works in literary perspective,"Plenty of books analyze the world of science fiction, but few narrow the focus to literary impact, as does ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SCIENCE FICTION: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO THE LIVES AND WORKS OF SCIENCE FICTION WRITERS. College-level readers receive a comprehensive A-Z reference of over 500 entries for both authors and works, placing the writer and achievements in perspective of literary merits and including a bibliography, glossary of terms, and survey of the basic science fiction literary movements which evolved. Even peripheral writers like Stephen King who have made definitive marks on the genre receive recognition in this fine, college-level reference."
5,Suspence at it's best!,"Dark shadows was the best tv series ever shown. NBC's biggest mistake was the cancellation of Barnabus's tale. Personally it is one of the best vampire novels ever written and far better than its original. Dark Shadows is a great collection of video's to own ,And amazon is the only place i ever found them."
1,IT Equipment Express,The mouse is fine. I paid $45 for the first one from Amazon. I need one more and am buying directly from Logitech for half what this supplier is charging for a used one.
4,Lefty breaks free of right hand mouse,I was recently diagnosed with carpal tunnel. I am left handed but have always moused with my right hand. The doctor suggested I figure out ways to spare my right hand so I made the switch to the Logitech MX 610 Left-Hand mouse. At first I was tring to use a universal mouse with the buttons reversed but it was not working well. As soon as I got the MX 610 I made the transition to left handed mousing with ease. I was surprised how quickly I made the change once I had the right mouse. I don't really use many of the extra funtions so I can't comment on that. I did keep my right handed Logitech VX Revolution mouse for those times I have a righty that can't adjust. You can run both mice with no problem. I plug the cordless adapter into my monitor and have no signal problems.
4,Not great for gaming,"There are very few choices for a left handed cordless mouse. I've had the MX610 for over 5 years. I'm happy it has lasted this long. It is not the best mouse for gaming, tho. What surprises me is the price has TRIPLED since 2006! What's up with that?I had very annoying erratic behavior a year or so ago. I installed new batteries, cleaned my mouse pad, dusted the laser cover and reinstalled the software. I cured the jumping problem by moving the USB holder near my monitor.Recently, I developed a problem where occasionally the USB is not detected by Windows 7-64 (started after I did a full reinstall of Win7). Updating the Logitech software does not work. I just pull out the USB and reinsert it. Maybe the USB is failing or a Windows update caused it."
2,"Great mouse, while it lasts","When I first got this mouse as a gift a few years ago, it was great. I loved the shape, the button placement, the functionality, the cordlessness, etc. I also felt the battery life was good.But after about a year of use, I noticed that I started having trouble dragging items -- it seemed like the main mouse button was faulty in some way. I never damaged the hardware, and I'm not a hard clicker or anything. So I used my warranty and had a new one sent to me for free. Now about another year later, the same sort of thing is happening. This time, when I click once, it registers as a double-click. It's very annoying.Another thing: in the course of normal use, a sometimes the pointer movement lags. All of this, unfortunately, makes this mouse less than a precision device. I'm going to have to see if I can use the warranty again, but I'm probably better off just looking for a new mouse."
3,Logitech MX-610 Left-Hand Laser Cordless Mouse,"Very easy to set up and install, comes with its own AA batteries, looks sharp on the desk, this has been a good solid peripherals investment. The left wheel / right wheel bit I may never use but with the otjer buttons on board it has more than enough features to satisfy.Only one area of additional expense, the price one pays being a Mac User, I suppose, but I found myself having to purchase ""SteerMouse"", a 3rd-Party Mac mouse driver from this Japanese shop. This gave me all the functionality of SetPoint, the Logitech PC driver. SetPoint, BTW, worked just fine with my XP-controlled PC.Bottom Line: 3 to 4 Mouse Turds."
5,as expected...,"Only true lefty mouse I'm aware of that has extra bells and whistles. It's a bit heavier than what I'm used to, and it could be lighter if the Li-ion battery were used in place of two AA's, but I suppose having standard battery is not necessarily bad.Overall, very satisfied. Comfortable and easy to use. Connection (i.e. for my PC to recognized the mouse initially and after reboot, etc) is reliable, and I've not had any problem since the purchase. Would recommend to those who are looking for a left-handed mouse."
5,Logicool???,"Bought this for our left handed daughter. The box said, ""Logicool,"" all over. She was worried that it was a knockoff but looked online and that's Logitech's Asian name. The instructions weren't in English but she's very happy with the mouse."
5,LEFTY POWER!,Yeah! I think this and another brand creates the only left handed mouses so I HAD to support the cause because I'm left handed. It feels great to have a mouse contoured for the left hand and having the extra buttons other mice don't offer. I only recommend buying if you can find it on sale though. $50 is a little steep!
1,Not recommended,"How do you screw up a mouse? Ask Logitech. NOTE: This Bluetooth mouse requires direct line-of-sight to the USB dongle, and the dongle must be placed no more than 2.5 feet from the mouse...and that's with new batteries. After figuring that out, I spent the remainder of the first week of use trying to get their SetPoint software to work, which crashed with an exception about once a day. I ended up removing the SetPoint software, and the mouse works just as well without it as with it...which isn't very well. The mouse suffers a 1-2 second latency to begin tracking movement when dormant for more than a few seconds. Probably a power-saving feature, but it's very annoying. The only thing good about this mouse is ergonomics, but it isn't worth the hassle. It has me thinking about going back to a wired mouse. Summary: buggy operation, poor reception. Not good if you're a company specializing in computer mice."
4,best mouse ever!,"i always dreamed with a 'real' left handed mouse, and logitech make this a reality. extreme resolution, nice design, configurable features like Email and Aim button with led ( blink/pulse when mail or aim message arrives ), there's only one complain: the middle button is a little hard to click, isn't problem for all. The wheel works fine.So, if you want a left handed mouse, this is your best choice !"
5,I love it!,I'm normally right handed but I have severe tendonitis in my right hand and wrist and cannot use a mouse. This is a great solution. It only took me a couple of hours to adapt and now I have the added bonus of a free right hand for taking notes. All right handed computer users should consider switching to a left hand mouse and leave the right hand free for more complex tasks.
3,Slow read,"I did not find this one very interesting. The whole plot bored me. I had a very hard time getting through it. I'm not going to be discouraged, I will go to the next one and hope it is better."
5,Who says the dead ain't interesting?,"Anita is back. This lady is one you want on your side. God help you if you're a bad guy. She' rough, tough and won't be pushed around by anyone, not even the most feared voodoo priestess in St. Louis. I recommend this to anyone who loved Guilty Pleasures."
4,Very Entertaining!,"Action packed, easy reading..a bit gory in some parts..but worth the time it takes to read. I can't wait to read the next one"
3,OK,Although the first bok in this series is really good this on e seemed a little dry and hard to follow for me. I was very disappointed
4,"Decent, but not as good as her first","Mrs. Hamilton does an admirable job of crafting a good, suspenseful story in this book. I must admit I enjoyed reading it and that I will one day probably read it again. But something about this book left me feeling that it lacked an element that should have been there. Maybe it was that the ending wasn't long enough - that there should have been more to the story after the evil-doer was caught.Anyway, no matter how I slice it, this was a good book filled with good writing."
5,The Laughing Corpse,"Laurell K. Hamilton is an awesome writer. I discovered her books by accident while looking on Amazon for DVD's of ""True Blood"". I read the critic reviews and decided to take a chance and purchased her first one of the Vampire series. Guilty Pleasures. I am now getting ready to finish book #3 Circus of the Damned. The books are well written and very hard to put down.Each book starts with another story but also talks about the last one and they all tie together. Definitely not for younger readers due to the graphic nature but a great read for fans of the undead."
3,"Read it to move the series along, it's worth sticking with","I can go back and forth on this one. I'm not going to say I loved it, it was nowhere as good as Guilty Pleasures was... I'm glad I read it, because it is a LONG series of books, and I want to like them and I want to not miss something.And truth be told, the book wasn't bad. It just wasn't... great.Ug. I'm going to go with indifferent. Read it if you plan on sticking with the series, because why would you skip a book? Read it if you want something that doesn't suck. Don't read it if you want a mind blowing or moving or touching or deep or amazing book to add to your collection. Does that makes sense?Would I read it again? Probably not. Am I glad I read it? Yes, I sure am. Now I can happily go on to the next book in the Anita Blake series."
3,Perservere,"If I had read this first instead of Guilty Pleasures I would probably not have read another one. The violence in this book is pretty stomach-churning, and while it's blackly funny in parts, there isn't as much personal interaction as in the other Anita Blake books I've read. So if this is your first exposure to Anita Blake, don't be discouraged but go on and try the rest of the series."
5,The second gets gory.,"I was excited to read the next book from the Anita Blake novels. It was gory yes, but it still held Anita in there. She is something else, so many words to describe her. I love her character. Now I can't wait to read the rest. I loved this book, and am reading the next. Not much of a review but I'm just letting ya'll know this is a must buy after the first book. ;)"
5,Great Suspense,"Fast read, reading on the edge of my seat to see what happens. Wonderfully entertaining, you'll enjoy it. All of her books are great and love how the hero is a woman!"
3,Good,"The book was alright. I liked the story, but sometimes repeating the same thing in different areas can get annoying."
3,"Mmmm... Good, but I've read better","I was a little dissapointed by this book compared to GP. There were some terrifically funny parts and interactions but too much of it seemed to be blood, guts, gore, etc. It seemed to have more gore than story but hey, it was entertaining, (I guess.) I really like the GIRL POWER note in every book, no matter how cliche it may seem. I most certainly think that Ms. Hamilton can do better."
3,Entertaining Gore,"This is the first book I've read of the Anita Blake series so I can't compare it to the others. Initially I found, that with one gory or menacing scene following another in rapid succession, I didn't have time to develop much empathy for the characters, and became ho-hum about rotting body parts and scowling bad guys. It's all very much `in your face'. I found the humor to be of the `insults tossed back and forth' type, which is as tiresome to read about as it is to listen to in real life, rather than that of character wit or originality, for which I was hoping. But when the author backed off and gave me space I did get a chance to feel her power and potential as a writer and a story-teller. Some of the characterizations were nicely done, and Jean-Claude was mesmerizing. I'd have liked it better if I'd not felt that the author was simply trying to gross me out."
2,Dissapointed,"I'd heard a lot of good things about the Anita Blake series so I thought I would give it a read. I was quite dissapointed with this book. I love to read and have just finished up reading a ton of different vampire series (Sookie Stackhouse, The Vampire Academy, Twighlight, Black Brother Dagger Hood, The Vampire Diaries, and the list goes on and on). Anyhow I was really hoping these books would be good but they just didn't do it for me. Now I have to try and search for some new series to read. Bottom line I don't recommend this book, however I enjoyed the books I've listed above."
5,great book,"i really love this series, i cant believe people are so hateful sometimes on reviews. i think hamilton does a wonderful job creating a rich and wonderful world full of interesting and creative creatures and lives. i would highly recommend to anyone who loves mystery intrigue and horror all roled into one, oh and with a side of sex, that never hurt anyone. lol I love micah!!!!!"
4,"Fun, Fun,Fun","I am hooked. I love Anita Blake. The character is so much fun to follow along with. This series is just great fun. I read the first in the series and enjoyed the book. But this second entry I felt was much better.Hamilton keeps the twists and surprises coming. and she makes the unbelievable setting, believable.Anita Blake is sexy and tough, and her adventures are pure excitement. I love they way Hamilton writes. This is pure escapist fun. Hamilton transports you to another world, and once you start reading this series you will be hooked. I have already ordered the third in the series. I highly recommend."
3,Good book overall - if you like a lot of blood and guts,It takes a LOT for me to give a book 4 or 5 stars - so 3 stars still is a worth while read.Story had potential to be great - but the author is redundant. As other reviewers point out - you quickly tire of the main character repeatedly saying 'Ri ight' - gets old very fast.The blood and gore is very overdone and not needed. The intrigue is much better. The possibility of relationship between the main character and the Master Vampire is great - always wondering what will happen. Also the main character isn't a saint - which is refreshing.I enjoy the series - and will continue to read more of it. Not the best book I've ever read - but far from the worst. I recommend it.
5,"Vampires, Zombies, Werewolves, oh my!!!","Ok, here's how NOT to start your day. Don't even accept an invitation to raise a centuries old corpse. The people in question have a tendancy to want to use you to raise it if you won't do the job for them. Next, don't piss off the Alpha leader of a very powerful werewolf pack, especially if his Alpha mate is a really twisted person, who has a werecougar as her bodyguard, and he likes to wear silver pierced through his body just to feel the pain. And lastly, don't fall in love with the Alpha wolf's main rival. This could be detrimental to both his and your health, when the master Vampire of the city is also in love with you. All in all, this was a thoroughly enertaining book, and I have loved this series from book one. I highly recommend this to anyone who is into strange occurrences, which could happen to you if you just happened to turn the wrong corner on the wrong street.Who said this wasn't for real"
4,Oh my,"I really like this author. She has a way of describing things right down to the nitty gritty. She can give you a real sense of being right there and seeing, smelling, feeling and tasting whatever is going on. She is one of the best authors I have read in a while. The only reason that I gave this book four stars is because of the GORE!! I read the first book in this series and didn't think it was that bad....but this one....OH MY! I am not a sensitive person....at least I thought I wasn't....so all I can tell you is if you want nightmares read this book. The author is good, the story is good....but I could of kind of done without the gore. This book gave me nightmares."
4,Another Winner.......,I have to tell you..Im loving these Anita Blake books..definitely something different. I enjoyed this story very much...my one complaint??? Not enough Jean Claude...this is one wild ride..I highly recommend getting into this series..its worth your while and sooo entertaining!!
4,Great Series,"I enjoyed this book, I liked it better than the first book. It is a lot more gory than I expected and rather dark. In this book, a Zombie is killing entire families and it isn't pretty. Anita comes up against a Voodoo Queen, she asked Anita to join her in raising Zombies and when Anita declines, she sends a couple of zombies to kill Anita. The Master Vampire of the City keeps reminding Anita that she is his human servant, she has been marked by him twice, Anita doesn't want any part of him, but she does lust after him. This book is fast paced and I found it to be a quick read."
1,they get worse,You want to trust me on this. I read 10 of these books I'm ashamed to say. I kept hoping they would get more like the first one but they don't. The devolve into just more and more sexual debauchary. More and more partners and more deviant sex with each one. So if you think you are going to get a series about a fantasy heroine just stop now. The only people who will like this series as it continues are people who are into really sick sex. I finally gave up when I found myself having to skip over almost 90% of the book. With the progression at that point I could only assume the rest of the books would be entirely about sex. THis becomes something that belongs in Hustler (the porn mag) not the fantasy book shelf.
4,not that good after readin Guilty pleasures but still ok,The Laughing Corpse was ok but after reading Guilty Pleasures it kinda let you down. you still get to read about Anita and Jean-Claude (whom i think is great). this book was not as good becuause all she does is kill a zombie that was raised and was killing people...other than that there is a little more to keep the plot going. i would still read it because it is crucial to the series and though there isn't as much desired from it you still need to read it and it is ok.
2,Guilty Pleasures,"This book wasn't what I thought it was going to be. This isn't author's fault. I thought I was getting a vampire romance fantansy and that is not what these books are about, apparently. They are violent, more like fantasy detective novels, and this Blake character is kind of hard core. I didn't like her and I think that's the idea. She's blunt, rude, weird, and very masculine. And I think she really doesn't like sex, let alone men, much. So if you're looking for a fun romance, buyer beware. However, if romance isn't your thing, and violence is, these books may be your cup of tea."
2,THIS BOOK EXCEEDED MY QUOTA FOR GORE--,"I could have skipped this second in series as it was too drawn out, too gory, too dismal, and too boring to be enjoyed. Wow! What a weird combination. I don't mind the rough stuff in doses, but this was a solid book of it. It made me grumpy--there were no moments of relief and very little about the vampires, just your non average human-eating monsters (the one made up of various body parts was a bit too much.) I sighed with relief when I finished this book. I had not enjoyed it and was glad to see it end."
3,Not going to lie...kind of boring.,"This book was really boring. I LOVED the first one so I went out and bought The Laughing Corpse...to my dismay it took me 3 times as long to read because it sucked that much. I almost stopped reading the series but a friend of mine said that the first few are kind of slow and then it picks up and you can't stop reading them. So after The Laughing Corpse I gave Circus of the Dammed a try and thank GOODNESS because that book rocked! So, if your feeling this book is a little slow, don't worry because the next ones a blast!!"
4,More bloody than the first.,"The second in the Anita Blake series, I'm not sure The Laughing Corpse would be as good without having first read Guilty Pleasures. It doesn't strike me as a coherent stand alone novel, but having read Guilty Pleasures first I can't say for sure.There is a lot going on in this novel. Master Vampires, a killer zombie, voodoo and guys in wheelchairs, most of them out to get our heroine. The action is fast paced and rarely lets up.The mystery aspect is well written, but the perpetrator is revealed about halfway through the novel, which made me second guess that outcome. The remainder of the book focuses on why and what went wrong.We see a more vulnerable Anita in this novel and I liked her. We also go on a journey with her to a very dark, very gruesome place. If you're squeamish at all this one could give you nightmares."
3,"It's still Anita, but...","The Laughing Corpse, the second book in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series, is a great book, don't get me wrong. However, The theme of this book veers from the predominant one in the series, that of Vampires and Werecreatures. The focus in this book is on the oh-so-many zombies that Anita can raise. Zombies are great, but they don't do much in the department of moving the story along. The story seems slow and yet, it's written in the ever-detailed style of the lovely Laurell K. Hamilton. Unfortunately, the book does little for the series, and the editing is as bad as in the rest of the first 5 books. The Laughing Corpse tells neccesary things you must know if you are reading the series in order, but otherwise is one you can skip."
5,Lawson is awesome!,"This collection is an excellent introduction to the work of John Lawson. His stories conjure up worlds that are like cover songs of our reality, where the original version is recognizable, but its absurdism, grotesqueness, humor, and refusal to adhere to the laws of physics make it into something entirely different. There was this feeling that I kept getting as I read this book, something difficult to communicate without sounding a little silly: something alien-like and gooey, like I was spending time in a radically different headspace.My favorite story in the book was 'Less Than Lickable,' which is novella-length. This one is a little different from the rest. Instead of using a world of the bizarre, Lawson chooses to use a more familiar setting while sucking up all the strangeness of his other stories into the body of the mentally unbalanced protagonist, who manipulates his environment in many amusing ways."
2,Not for the later stages of motherhood.,"I was looking forward to reading about mothering adult children, but this is mostly about mothering children while they are still at home."
4,mezzanine,"The mix of sounds were quite versatile. Hopefully with some of the inspiration I recieved from massive attack & artists who have worked with them I'll be able to come up with some new sounds as well. It would be nice to some day have one of my CD's analized here five to six years from now. I want to take music to the next level like Tricky, & Portishead did!"
5,Just What I Wanted,I looked for a time for this item locally and gave up. I don't do lawn care but will use these items cleaning race tracks.
1,King's speech,Hated this. There's nothing about the story here. This is only for someone who has read the book and seen the movie and just love both so much they plan to immerse themselves in the idiots responsible for both. i can't enjoy watching a bunch of Hollywood types patting themselves on the back for what they perceive to be a great success; especially when I don't think it was a success..
1,did not watch,I don't remember ever downloading this movie. I will not watch it because I do not watch rated R movies. Where did itcome from. I must call them.
5,Fantastic,"This is just one of those movies that you can watch over and over and never get sick of. The acting is great, the story is great, and the cinematography is great."
4,Great Movie,we loved it it was fun to watch the whole family can enjoy it together for a family fun night
1,The King's Speech,"This is about the movie, and is not the movie itself. It is quite disappointing when something is listed as a FREE MOVIE, but instead is only a ""clip"" about it. It is disappointing that Amazon would do this. It should be clearly listed as a ""clip about the movie""."
1,Lame. It's just a trailer.,This is described as the movie The King's Speech. It's really a trailer. I find this very misleading. Why have a catalog item for a trailer I can see on Rotten Tomatoes?
1,Where did it say it's a preview?,"This is just preview rather than a full movie, amazon should clearly say it or put it in a different section, this is a big disappointment."
1,miscategorized,"This is advertised as the movie, not a review. No wonder it was free. Now I have to go find the full version."
1,"Can I give it ""zero"" stars?","I suppose that having a misleading blurb about a ""Free Movie"" is in keeping with the downward trend in what you get for ""Prime Membership"". You're definitely slipping, Amazon."
5,Never thought a movie about speech impediments could be dramatic,"High points:1. King George VI handling adversity by exploring the full range of emotions as it contrasted to his duty.2. Supporting role of his wife dealing with a family of means.Personal low point:I had no reference for this British monarch prior to the film. Regardless of the film, I thought I knew more than Winston Churchill during this period of world history. Perhaps not."
5,Just a great all-around movie!,"Great story, acting, and direction! If you're a history buff like me, you are draw to the true story of the King Edward's abdication of the throne, and King George's challenge of becoming a public speaker, while overcoming is stammering handicap. Colin Firth is just amazing in his performance of King George."
2,Not the movie...it's the trailer.,I saw this for a free download on my Kindle fire and did so only to find that it is only a five minute trailer. Very disappointed.
3,I was looking for the movie,I was looking for the movie and got a How-We-Made-It story. My bad I didn't read the fine print before ordering
1,Fooled like everyone else ...,"Like everyone else, I thought that I was going to watch the full movie. You didn't really expect to get any good reviews, did you?"
1,disappointed..,i agree that its false representation that it claims its a movie but its not. It makes me wonder what else is going to be a surprise as a prime member?
1,lthough this looks like a good movie...,"...it really isn't a movie at all, it's a trailer. I have no idea why Amazon lists is as a movie, it's a good trailer, makes me want to see the movie but it's very misleading."
1,""" Misleading description. it is just a 5minute trailer of the movie. they should mention it somewhere. ""","""Misleading description. it is just a 5minute trailer of the movie. they should mention it somewhere. "" ""Misleading description. it is just a 5minute trailer of the movie. they should mention it somewhere. """
1,Misleading title,"This is not the movie; it's just some 5-minute review. Yeah, I know this is free for Prime users, but the feeling of being fooled is bad enough for a one-star rating."
1,Amazon Trailer trash,"I signed up for amazon instant videos thinking I would get some movies for the $79 anual fee, but it looks like you only get trailers for free, the movie costs an extra ten bucks. Total rip."
1,5 minute trailer,Don't bother it is only a trailer. Very misleading doesn't say it's a featurette. Disappointed. Not Prime. Should state not the movie. I'll keep trying first time customer.
1,What product????,"I did not purchase the product I have been asked to review. I was considering purchasing ""The King's Speech"" as it appeared in movie theatres. When I realized this ""The King's Speech; Road etc etc, "" was not a movie, I decided NOT to purchase it. If I have been charged for it, please credit mu account for the puchase price.James Foley"
1,"Wrong, Not a Free Movie.","Simply a trailer, you should be truthful and state you get the trailer for free, You can get that anywhere. I heard the movie is great but the con job of a free movie is no stars."
3,good,"very injoyable film , would most likely see it again espeahly the purformance by the lead actor , outstanding. Would recommend this movie."
2,Not very interesting,"This is a mini-documentary about the making of the movie, not the movie itself. I did not realize that when I purchased it, and was greatly disappointed. Be careful what you are getting when you place any order here."
3,Red Stuff,Unsure how to rate this as I don't notice any physical changes from taking it. Tastes great although I do not mix it in water as you lose too much stuck to the glass (it costs as much as silver). I put one teaspoon in my mouth and then add sips of water. No mess or lose of product.
3,Nice picture of an unusual life,"Rabbi Cohn moves his story along quickly, with short (1 to 2-pg) sections forming a 60-pg. autobiography. His writing style is clear and compelling.Cohn tells of becoming a rabbi in his native Hungary in the 1880s. His readings in the Talmud drive him to a growing interest in the Messiah. This drives him to leave his wife and children behind for a trip to New York City. There he comes to believe that Jesus was the hoped for Messiah. He comes under intense persecution, and ends up at (Presbyterian) New College in Edinburgh, Scotland, reunited with his family. He wife comes to share his convictions and leaves a happy life in Scotland to begin a mission to Jews in Brooklyn (Williamsburg and Brownsville), supported by Baptist churches and some other Jewish believers in Yeshua. This grew into Chosen People Ministries in 1894.The book is nicely packaged. It also features a solid modern bibliography of Jewish and Jewish-Christian writings."
1,A tortured and misinterpreted youth tells his story.,"The Winter Prince was amazing. I found myself frustrated with Medraut when he became arrogant and prideful. He refused to ask his father, Artos, for help in battling his evil mother, Morgause. I felt helpless because I could not offer Medraut support. Luckily Medraut begins to change as Lleu begins to trust him. I love the ending where....well I won't tell you that. This book is really great! It kept me on the edge of seat. The historical attributes help me understand ancient history that had been confusing previously."
4,Read this book in 1 day,"This was a good book! I started it and couldn't put it down. I rate books 3 ways - (1)KEEP IT AND SHARE IT, (2)GIVE IT TO THE BOOK EXCHANGE AFTER READING OR (3)THROW IT AWAY. This is a keep, share and then give to the book exchange."
2,Disappointment,"I thought to try out a new author, boy am I disappointed. She drones on endlessly with nonsense descriptions. In the middle of a conversation I don't care what the rings in the bottom of a coffee cup look like. This author can waste pages upon pages on describing the room, the elevator, the view, the clothes, the coffee cup, the waiter, the ...all in the middle of a conversation. This is one of the disadvantages of an audio book on CD, you can't just skim past the trivia. I won't waste my money buying another of her books."
4,4 1/2 stars -- loveeed it!!,"Ok first of all, Sam McCabe is by FAR my favorite hero from Karen Robards (in her contemporaries). I would have given this five stars but I just prefer historical to contemporary. However....this is the BEST of her contemporaries! Loved it! I love the plot line where the hero and heroine are forced to be around each other and therefore cannot ignore their growing attachment. Maddie is a smart, beautiful business owner with a past.. that includes a hatred for FBI agents. Sam is an FBI agent determined to protect her - even if it means using her as bait to catch a killer. The plot works great along with a steamy steamy romance. The plot sucks you in as well as the romance between the two. Plus, the addition of other characters and Zelda the bratty, adorable little dog - makes it all a winner. And did I mention Sam is the perfect alpha male FBI agent?? Hot!!"
3,Not that great,This book did not keep me engaged enough to want to read it in three days. The characters were believable enough but there was too much description of the surroundings and I would get lost in that versus the thriller it was supposed to be. I am not sure if I would read another Robard book but I will look up other reviews and possibly give her another try. I have read much better FBI novels in the past by other authors.
2,Really Bad!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been a fan of Karen Robards for years but with this book she has stooped to a new low. This book is not worth the money I paid for it! If you want to read it I would suggest going to the Library and checking it out.I gave this book two stars because the first half of the story is pretty good and then it goes downhill from there. When the stupid yaking mutt of a dog (and I love dogs) is brought into the story things go downhill fast! This dog is as annoying as they come. The dog made me want to quit reading the book it was so stupid. It seems like she brought in this dog to fill up the pages. I don't remember ever being so annoyed with a book in my life, this is bad!I would suggest to Ms. Robards that she go back to what she does best and that is write romance like she use to. The romance in this book isn't even that great...."
2,Using a dog was not a good idea.,"I listened to this while travelling instead of reading it.I mentally edited the clumsy wording. I forgave the attampts to keep the heroine's mob connections a mystery until it became intrusive to the main story.I was willing to overlook the standard romance details - the manly chest, the secret thrill to be held close against ""his"" warmth.But the use of an ill mannered dog as comic relief fell flat when the ""heroine"" chose to feed it peanut M&Ms; to keep it quiet. Both peanuts and chocolate are extremely toxic to dogs. When she stopped to buy something for the dog to eat, she didn't bother with even a hamburger but went straight to the french fries. At this point I reversed the tape and returned it.I've enjoyed some of Karon Robard's books in the past. But this one was more on the lines of a talented amateur instead of someone with her amount of experience."
2,Slow,"This one just didn't grab me. The dog bit was just too much, and the rest of it didn't flow. It was an effort to finish this one!"
2,"Story OK, But...","The mystery was interesting, but the author used too many cliches and tired, over-used expressions. It began to irritate me immediately. Not only did she use annoying cliches, but she used them repeatedly. Ugh!!!!"
1,Skip it...........,"I don't understand some reviewers at all. This book was hardly entertaining enough to hold my interest. Robards should stick to writing historical romances, that's what she is really good at.The mob stuff ~ omg ~ so cliché! As soon as I read the word ""whacked"" I rolled my eyes. Don't read this book if you're looking for a gripping story about the murder, the mob, or the FBI. Only die-hard Robards fans will enjoy this one. The only reason I kept going was b/c I knew she would throw in a few hot scenes between Sam and Maddie.To the reviewer who said she wasted time on details between conversations ~ I totally agree."
4,Loved it...couldn't put it down!!!,This is one of those books impossible to stop reading. I inhaled it! It's the first Robards book I've read so I'll definitely try another one...hoping it's just as good. The pace of the book is just right to keep you reading. The characters are likeable and believable and the romance is both sweet and hot. Read it....
1,"If you love New Orlenas, don't read this",The author didn't even make the effort to get the street names right.
5,Intelligence Captured in Song,"Eastman is a San Francisco Bay Area-based jazz singer. She swings, scats, teases a ballad and takes risks. She has a fine vibrato that she does not use often in the service of a song. She can be Betty Carter-daredevil one minute and be Dominique Eade-cerebral in another. Her version of ""Get Happy"" was unlike what we have heard of in years. She cuts the phrases and syllabicated some in unexpected ways. Her version of Carole King's ""Up On A Roof"" will make you realize how this woman can just about make any music sound jazzy."
5,Flame...,"I agree with reviewer ""tws Thomas Saunders"" that they should re-release Ronnie Laws' Flame. They've re-released (not remastered) ""Friends and Strangers"" and ""Every Generation."" (favorites of mine!) Every now and then, some third parties offer up copies, but at $40/US and higher (remastered!). I bought the ""Every Generation"" for $9.49/US and ""Friends and Strangers"" for $9.99/US. They are perfectly fine copies of a great modern musician's work!Until they re-release ""Flame,"" I'll have to make do with my Ronnie Laws' ""Greatest Hits"" collection(s) which features the songs ""Flame"" and ""Living Love"" from the ""Flame"" Album. Five stars!!"
5,RL making H-Town proud!!!,"'Flame' is Laws' absolute best---even its cover is awe-inspiring! Whomever re-releases this masterpiece will certainly clean up. I've searched everywhere for over 18 years for a copy and finally found one here on Amazon, and I already own the LP and cassette. As a previous reviewer has stated, every song contained seems to have a common fantasy/mystical theme with each other---which is a good thing. Even though the going price for one may be a bit steep, you can purchase it, download it, then sell it right back on Amazon and recoup your $$$ easily---it's THAT much in demand. 'Flame' seems to be the least 'radio-friendly' of all his works, but it's the one that's in demand the most amongst his true fans."
4,Interesting and easy read,"Quite fun book, collection of essays on all kinds of topics. Some repetition occurs, it's not written as one volume, but it's fine, and the repetition is usually pretty limited.It's relatively easy to grasp what he's saying here, and it's also great fun from time to time, especially one of the essays regarding self-control.All in all a nice and interesting book, always fun reading the musings of smart people."
5,A Lily Among Thorns,"If you like Francine Rivers, you'll like this writer. A beautiful story that is so historically correct you can imagine yourself there. This is very well written, I highly recommend it."
4,Great book for a 6 year old boy,My two sons love this book. We read parts of it right before bedtime and they both love it (I have a 5 and 6 year old)
4,Just reread it,"These were my favorite books when I was a kid; the deceptively simple stories with the deeply buried clue, the illustrations that make EB look about 5'3"" (I always thought he was 12, not 10!), the answers at the back...it's all still there. I wouldn't want it any other way. A must-read."
5,Encyclopedia Brown Boy Detective (#1) by Donald J Sobol,"I brought this book for a grandson. My son had always enjoyed all of the Encyclopedia Brown books. I wanted this to be a special gift, so I purchased the first story in the series.His stories always brought joy to my son. He would read many times and his friends also read the same stories. I would recommend this book for parents with grade school children, especially boys."
2,"For Children, not adults","I never read this as a child. And that may be why I don't find it so enchanting. Perhaps I should have.In my quest to read the best literature this came up as an acquisition for my iPad. Easy to store and add to my collection. And then I started to read it.Amazon says that it is for ages 7 and up. I should have noted that. It is not like the Hardy Boys, but written as a series of puzzles for the reader to guess the answer. Short three to five page teasers.For a child, it is probably enjoyable. For an adult, we have much greater puzzles to solve than these."
3,Average,It's an okay book. It's more puzzle book than story book. Each chapter is a short mystery with the who done it left to the reader to figure out. Any reader familiar with logic puzzles shouldn't be baffled by them at all.
2,uninteresting,"I read this with a 3rd grade class, thinking they would love the series. Instead, they were instantly bored and had trouble paying attention. The stories have ""clues"" that are not mentioned. or require specific background knowledge most children to do have. For instance, one stories involves china. What child knows knows much about this? Perhaps they know they eat off china on special occasions, but that is it. China is going to pull in a young reader? I cannot think of a better way to put boys to sleep! I loved this series when I was young, but have realized it is not relevant for children today."
2,Not the best book in the whole world,"Encyclopedia Brown-Boy Detective is fine, but not very exciting because the mysteries are too short and lack suspenseful action."
3,Dry and Poorly Written,"This book is a detail oriented, poorly written guide to office building management. Having purchased the book in order to become aquainted with the field of office buidling management I was very disappointed. This title went into far to deatiled analysis of tax law, liability insurance, mundane details of lease writing, and tenant selection. For anyone that does not already have a deep understanding of office building management I would defintely recommend steering clear of this particular title."
4,too sweat for my taste. Dog and geese love it,"this is too sweet. looks almost like a baklava, but instead of honey it seems to use lots of sugar, fructose or whatever"
3,OK for now?,"Installed two on my Suburban, was going cheap and didn't want to spend $60 (times 2) for new drive shafts. Of course the second one went on at half the time maybe 20 min. I wish they would given better instructions for the bands (or provided tool), why not use hose clamps? Why no youtube videos? or videos on the Dormans website? [...]I felt I was not getting the band tight enough (or will it stay put?). As an extra measure and because it was laying around, I put RTV on the seam. Will update if I see grease (leaking)"
1,Almost Useless for Identifying Edible Plants,"Just received the book. Haven't read it yet, just looked through it. It may have some good information in it, but...I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to actually go outdoors and find edible plants with the serious intention of eating them.The images of plants are simple line drawings, almost useless for learning what the plants, both edible and poisonous, really look like. I could have started with a simple list of the plant names and found much better info on the web. In fact, that's probably what I will use it for, aside from a doorstop, if that."
5,Wonderful,"This book is enjoyable for the quality of the writing as well as for the interesting plant lore. It is graceful, intelligent, and clear. Ms. Roos-Collins is an author you'll love spending time with."
2,"nice ideas and designs, but....","There are lovely stained glass ideas in this book, but... to use as a coloring exercise, you need to know that you really have to have felt tip pens to make the colours show up. There is a lot of black surrounding the designs and the ""transparent"" colouring areas are a light gray which cuts down on the brilliancy of any colouring."
3,Not what I expected...,"It was a great idea but I didn't like the paper that the pages were printed on. I wanted to use colored pencils but they didn't even show up on the almost plastic coated pages. It would be a great idea book for stained glass work but as a coloring book it was disappointing when all I could use on the pages were markers to have any color show up.And, yes, I am an adult that likes to color! I can't crochet to save my life and cross stitch frustrates the bejeebers out of me. Coloring is a great stress reliever."
3,Another Scandinavian band in the mix,"First off, I'm a big fan of Scandinavian pop/rock (Wannadies, Happydeadmen, Merrymakers, This Perfect Day). This release is fairly consistent, but not spectacular. It's at it's best when the guitars are up front; when they slow down the tempo my interest waned. This is one of those records where you wonder what subsequent releases sound like; I hear potential. My fav tracks are California, and I Killed a Boy with a Girl. A modest thumbs up."
3,Not worth the O'reilly name,"This might be a decent reference book if it contained more detailed information. I am a junior in college and was required to read this book from cover to cover and it was extremely boring. Anything the author discussed could easily be learned from help files or a quick glance at the website the product came from. THe author uses the phrase 'this is beyond the scope of this book' just when he begins to talk about something you may not have already known.In conclusion, this would probably be an excellent book for somebody just starting out using troubleshooting tools, but if you have had more then 6 months experience in the field you already know most of the topics he covers."
3,OK,"Eh, book was okay, but didn't really flip my burger. If you want a nice primer on some of the software tools and commands that you can use for monitoring system performance, this book would probably be just fine. Could have used more graphics. Good for reading at bedtime or in your time off, but just a little too wordy looking if you're in the field actually trying to get something done."
3,Good mystery,"I remember seeing this movie on tv years ago and really liked it. It is a good mystery with every character looking and acting guilty at some point in the story. Everyone does a good job acting and most are familiar faces: Kim basinger, Robert Culp, Stephen Macht, John Rubenstein and late great Nancy Marchand. The overall quality of the transfer is fair and that is why only 3 star rating."
2,"Good TV movie, Less than good print","Who Murdered Joy Morgan [aka Killjoy] is a decent suspense movie. This print by CineVu is not the greatest. The color values have gone awry, which could be expected in a film this old. There is some very annoying audio interference, and my guess is that this print was taped off of television. The box also states that this is a widescreen edition, which it is not. TV movies from 1981 weren't filmed in widescreen; the only way it could be in wide screen were if the top and bottom of the picture were cut. Try to find a better print of this movie than CineVu's. 4 stars for the movie and performances; 2 stars for the DVD."
1,Beware misleading seller!,"Like some others - I received a BestAir brand instead of Essick brand. It was ordered from the seller 'Buy-it-now-store'. I cannot vouch for the other sellers.It lasted less than a month, turned rusty brown along the top within days and stank upon initial use. I will not be ordering from 'Buy-it-now-store' again."
4,Pretty good item. Will order again.,"These were pretty good turtle-like chocolates. The chocolate itself was good, not great. The caramel was pretty smooth and creamy. Granted, I'm comparing these to others that I've had and the best I've had which came fresh off the line at the Lindt & Sprungli Chocolate facility in NH during a tour of their facility. I didn't expect these to beat those, but these were pretty good. They were also fairly inexpensive in comparison to those made by Lindt. With that said, I will order these again as they were very much enjoyed."
5,This is good stuff...,"There is no way a scan is going to be better than the original its scanned from.Unless you expect somebody to retouch 11,000+ pages you will be happy with this package.It's looks exactly like you remember the original comics.I'm delighted with this DVD and am delighted there's no more DVDs like this being produced."
3,"Great item, but free shipping crushed my box.","I'm very glad that I bought this item, but I wanted to say something about the shipping of my item. I opted for the free shipping through Amazon since it was available. The box they put my item in was clearly too small and they had to crush my product's box to get it to fit in. I have never seen such a horrifying lack of concern over shipping from Amazon. I've used their free shipping several times and never had an item crushed into a too small box. I'm reluctant to use their free shipping again. Maybe you really do get what you pay for."
4,"I wouldnt say complete, but pretty darn close.","this comes with fantastic four v1 1-416, v2 1-13, v3 1-70, and 500 and up plus annuals. As for silver surfer it comes with v1 1-18, v2 1, v3 1-146, v4 1-14 plus annuals. If you've seen my other comic cd reviews you'd be wondering why I gave this 4 stars well, unlike x-men and spider-man the ff only have one mag, thus no crossovers with issues missing and no missing out on stories from other mags. It is missing a few mini-series one shots and graphic novels but that's only like 4 to 6 issues id say this is a great item for any ff and/or silver surfer fan however I really wish it came with the before the ff comics, those where goodFantastic Four and Silver Surfer - Complete Comic Edition"
4,Jon Bayliss review on wheels,"I'm definitely a house purist. But this series, paticularly this CD brings a cool elegance to the drum n bass and ambient genre. Smooth Licks and tight percussion patterns make anything by K&D a collectors item.Stay with it."
3,Don't be fooled..,"Albeit a decent album, ""Dj-Kicks"" just has one too many boring and cliched beats. You know what I'm talking about...those generic Roni Size-type grooves that are incessant and repetitive beyond toleration. The layering that K&D does on top of the beats is clever at times, but the foundation of the songs is weak. Although the consensus below is that the album is amazing, don't buy into the hype; it's only mediocre. There are some tight tracks like their remix of T.Corp's ""Shaolin Satellite"", but the whole of the album bores me. My suggestion is that if you like ambient albums that are also interesting and inventive, ""Sessions"" is a MUCH better choice. But I suppose if you're into bland beats and lackluster mixing...go for this one."
3,Quite Good,"At the risk of sounding out of place, I don't think this CD is as great as some people make it out to be. I am not an avid clubber or party-chiller-out. I like to listen to good music on my personal stereo. As such, I find the selection of tracks quite good, the seamless mixing great, and, yes, quite possibly this disc *is* a benchmark for the DJ Kicks series. But, (you knew that was coming along, didn't you?) some of the original tracks they ""tidied up"" were not quite creative in the first place. In a lot of cases, the tracks get into a groove and just stick to it. OK, this is great for the grooves that rock, but not so great on the ones that don't. Hey listen, this is a subjective call: my impression changed with time and I grew to like the album more with time, but ultimately it is just a ""quite good"" collection of dancey-ambient tracks -- for me."
5,Unbelievably Good,"This is easily the best set in what is likely the most influential series being produced today. Studio K7 gives dj's the freedom to explore the music that has influenced their styles, and the results have been incredible. On this set, K&D take listeners on an incredible, ininterrupted journey through the depths of downtempo music. All I can say is WOW - to call this music smooth would be an understatement. The music is downright enthralling without demanding any energy on the part of the listener. True to Eno's conception of what great music can be, this set fits any occasion and mindfullness; it can be appreciated for its own beauty or used to set a mood. I have to be careful with when I play this disc, otherwise it would never leave my deck."
2,"2.5 stars, somewhat disappointed","i recently acquired several dj kicks cd's (smith and mighty, stereo mc's and k&d). they're all a bit over-stuffed, as well as over-rated. this one, however takes the cake. just about every song found here can be found on a better compilation or album (examples include ltj's logical progression, and thievery corp.'s songs (sounds?)from the thievery hifi) furthermore, where's all this ""great re mixing"" people are talking about? every song on this cd that i've heard before sounds EXACTLY the same as what i've heard elsewhere. finally, the smith and mighty installment in this series is the best i've heard so far, and i recommend it to anyone who wants to hear some real re mixing as well as tracks that they're unlikely to hear anywhere else."
1,cool factor isnt worth it,i really thought i got a classy watch i dont wear it to work and 2 1/2 years later the touch sytem no longer works .. dont even consider repairing it.. sorry to say it but my 35 dollar casio works a whole lot better
4,Tissot Titanium Touch watch,"Brilliant, new as stated, great condition, works wonderfully, brought as a 18th birthday present and my son who enjoys all the gimmicks. Arrived in less than 10 days from half way round the world. Cost less than half what it would cost here in Australia. No problems so far and I would recommend Amazon and the seller anytime."
1,"do not buy this watch,and please tell your friends.","i would have given it a zero if it was possible,what a waste of money,it has been back to tissot 4 times in 12 months.I am really really really dissapointed with this watch,it is a piece of worthless rubbish,I wish I didnt buy it.thanks for nothing people at tissot. I feel really strongly about this...this watch is a lemon."
1,Malfuction,"I bought this model and six months later the touch fuctions are not operating anymore. This is my second tissot that presented malfunctions. Attention *** tissot *** is this....."""
1,run away from this steaming pile of shi...,"Bought it on 3 Oct 2006, through a authorized dealer in Singapore.1. broke down after a few weeks, repaired by Swatch Group Singapore.2. broke down after a few weeks, repaired.3. broke down after a few weeks, replacement watch.4. broke down after a few weeks, repaired.5. broke down after a few weeks, I don't want the watch to be ""repaired"" anymore, I want a refund."
4,Probably the best map out there but could be better,"I like this map and I use it fairly frequently. It could be better however. My main grip is that it doesn't show what kind of road the bike route is on. It would be nice to know if there is a bike lane, on/off road... ect... otherwise... very nice map and the best I've seen in the Milwaukee area."
1,"Works good with ipods, not for iphone. Lots of noise.","I've got mine for over a year now.It works decently with most ipods, it pumps out a very low power signal, I have to turn the volume really high to be able to get a decent volume in the car's system. Unfortunatelly, one of the cars, has a ""top"" level, and will not reach a loud enough volume. You can hear a lot of hiss.When I plug the iphone, a dialog window pops on the iphone that reads something like ""This adaptor is not compatible with iphone, it may cause interference, do you with to turn off the phone?""If you say yes, the iphone goes into airplane mode. no cell or wifi.you still hear hiss. If you say NO, the phone works, but you can hear every time you switch cells, and 4 seconds before you get a call :)it makes a lot of beeping sounds caused by cell interference."
3,Okay,"We purchased this item for a 14 hour roadtrip. It worked well for the most part. Through most of the big cities, we experienced static despite efforts to find a clear channel. The static was not as noticeable with music, but very noticeable with books on tape. Overall, I am happy with the product. We did a lot of research before buying this one and it seems like static is an issue with this technology in general."
2,"Low Power, lots of ignition noise","I owned this for several months. The transmission power of the unit is low, and there was significant noise from the electrical system of my Tacoma in the audio. If the unit is used with the iPod connector the volume level of the iPod does not affect the volume level of the output. If you use the jack (I bought this unit because I have more than one MP3 player, and the jack lets me plug other players in) you get the same electrical system noise, and cranking the iPod volume level to its highest did not give any better results.An input volume control would help, but the unit did not have one. I am looking for a new adapter now...."
4,WORKS VERY WELL,WORKS WELL. THE ONLY THING I SEE IS THAT IT WILL WORK WITH MORE OR LESS STATIC DEPENDING ON THE FM RECEIVER IN THE CAR. PLAYS WITH NO STATIC IN MY CAR NOT QUITE AS STATIC FREE IN MY WIFES.
4,works great,"The transdock micro worked perfectly for me from the beginning. The default station 88.5 fm worked well and there was a minimum of work to get it going. I am using my shuffle with the transdock. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because you need to remove it from the lighter socket when you turn off the auto. It is not recommended that you leave it in the socket. Also, it is recommended that you need to increase the volume on the ipod first before than using the volume knob on your car radio."
1,Struck out on the DLO TransDock Micro,"After reading several reviews, I thought I was making the right choice of picking the DLO TransDoc Micro for my daughter. She has a 2001 Dodge Stratus and wanted to play her new IPOD in it. Well, the reception was very poor--a lot of static.I thought it might just be the car, so I tried it in my wife's 2002 Saturn station wagon. That was no better. I did the next best thing: I returned it. Oh well."
3,Doesn't fit unless you have a cigarette lighter,"I tried to the plug the TransDock into the socket in my car ('03 Honda Civic), but it didn't even fit! It was too fat and only went into the socket about halfway. I also tried to plug it into an '01 Honda Odyssey, and it didn't fit.Then I tried to plug the TransDock into an '01 Toyota Camry and '97 Dodge Neon, both of which have cigarette lighters. The TransDock fit in these cars without a problem.I don't think it's just Hondas that are a problem. I think the problem is with all socket-style outlets.So, if you're car has a cigarette lighter, no need to worry, the TransDock will fit in the outlet. But if you have a newer car, with a socket outlet (no cigarette lighter), the TransDock will not fit. I found that out the hard way, and now I'm returning the item.(I don't know how well it works, since I was never able to get that far.)"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,"After reading the other reviews, I thought I was making a good purchase. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is easily the worst performing product I've bought in a long time. Constant static no matter what station I put it on, and every 3rd or 4th song it just stops mid-song. Needless to say, I took my car in to have an iPod jack installed this weekend."
2,sound quality is great but hardware is not,"I have purchsed two of these. The first one I got from bestbuy cause the guy told me it was great. It did work great for about 3 months but then it started going in and out and then finally stopped. I thought I had a bad apple so I bought another one from wal-mart. After about 3 months it started doing the same thing. Well the warranty is only for 90 days so i'm out of luck. the 2nd one still works but it has a short it in so you never know when it might go out and how long it might stay out. As far as the qaulity of the sound, it was great when it worked so if DLO can ever get there quality of the hardware better then I would recomend this product otherwise you will spend a lot of money replacing it every 3 months."
1,Not compatible with 3G Ipod,"disappointing as description says the opposite. Will broadcast first song then locks up and never charges my iPod. I'm outside of the return period and so outside of luck. Not sure if its Amazon's mistake or a defective product. DLO's website just says not compatible with 2G shuffle, so I'm assuming its defective."
4,Works well,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He uses it just about everyday and hasn't had any complaints. The only advice I'd give is if you're planning on using it for a long road trip, you'll need to have someone else in the car with you to operate it because once you drive near / into a larger city you'll find that you'll need to find different stations which is a pain. We recently took a trip into DC and I found that I was changing the station fairly often because of interference. We don't live in a large city, so we don't have any day to day issues with this. All in all I think its a great product."
1,fell apart after 6 months - no customer service.,"There are wires that run through a hinge from the display to the part that plugs into the lighter. Eventually this plastic hinge wore out. Then the stress of pulling the charger out of the socket broke a wire. I actually took it apart and resoldered the wire, but I believe the electronics were fried when the wire broke loose. I got no support from the manufacturer, who arrogantly said ""you have to just buy another Transdock Micro."" Of course I did not follow their advice. I bought a ""Monster"" this time. Much more robust design."
4,I really like it.,"It's a very good product. The quality of the audio quality is great (once in a while I will pick up a slight hiss ... interference or mp3 quality? I'm not sure), no issues with the signal strength really in fact it seems to have pretty decent range, the cord allows me to keep the ipod in a safe place. I would have liked if it felt sturdier though because I feel that one day it's going to break from being pulled out of the lighter socket. And it would have been nice if the end of the cord that connects the to the micro was a standard usb connection so that it could be used to connect the ipod to a pc."
4,Good iPod device,"After using DLO TransDock micro with my 30GB video iPod for the past month, I'm pretty satisfied with it. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the volume of the audio could be a little better. I have to double or triple the volume on my radio when I use it, compared to the normal, lower volume when I'm just listening to my radio/cd player alone.I like the long cord which allows me to move my iPod around while I'm using it, without being locked to a fixed docking station. Since my car charter is in an inconveniently low place, I wouldn't be able to dock it anywhere useful."
2,Doesn't Deliever,This product does not deliver. You can't find a spot on the FM dial where it will come in clearly and as you drive you have to keep searching for a new broadcast channel. Don't waist your money.
5,I have recommended this to all of my friends,I'm thrilled with this purchase. I've never had a problem with it and I recommend it to all of my friends that do not have a cassette player or mp3 input in their car. I even bring it on vacations! The sound is clear and I never have to worry about the iPod battery dying. I have nothing but good things to say about this product. The only thing is I'm not sure if it is compatible with the newer iPod Touch or iPhones.
3,"If you have done any Yoga at all, don't bother.","Bryan is inspiring and he has a lot of good things to say. I just wish he would say it in the first session and then let me practice yoga in the rest of the sessions(four included on this DVD).I've done Yoga on and off for years and recently got into power yoga. This is waaaaaaaaaaaay to slow and by the time you feel any heat, you are done. If you are a beginer it would be pefect for about 2-3 weeks and then you'll need to move on to something more."
1,What are they trying to prove?,"By my reckoning, this book is a wordy, round-about, flawed argument for exploitation of natural gas to substitute for rapidly depleting oil reserves. After peeling away the accolades, one sees that the authors are apologists for the American way of life, but it is strange that they don't seem to come to grips with the fact that North America has long since peaked in natural gas. (Google Oil Crisis and check the gas.) Furthermore, transporting natural gas over large distances is extremely inefficient and sustains US dependency on foreign energy sources, contradicting the authors' stated objectives.If US security is the goal, then promoting a home-grown solution is the only sensible way forward. Solar and wind energy in mass production will be far more economical and require far less energy to deploy in comparison with fossil fuels and nuclear power."
1,"Pretentious, snobby and useless","I've never even read the book but I have a friend who takes this woman's class. She is a typical academic, knows a lot about nothing. You would be well advised to find a book by an author who actually cares about music and not academic snobbery."
3,A Little On The Square Side,"The Beiderbecke compositions on this CD are pretty good but the whole thing would have been better with some musicians who could swing. The record completely falls apart on the songs by other songwriters with the vocals. These songs remind me of the cutesy music on Garrison Kellor's NPR show. We're talking L7 daddy-o. But, Beiderbecke's beautiful compostions In The Dark, In A Mist, Davenport Blues, Candlelights, Flashes and Clouds are nicely done in a chamber setting."
2,Kind of a desecration,"Most people who are reading this are already Beiderbecke fans so you know the real, true thing when you hear it. My only fear is that someone would hear this album first and get the impression that Beiderbecke's legacy was kitschy old-time music and not worth pursuing. I mean, this CD is about as soulful as a barber-shop quartet at Disneyworld and I guess that kind of cute nostalgic fluff has a place -- somewhere in the universe. But Bix Beiderbecke was one of the great musicians of the last century and his recordings have a beauty and intensity that makes them utterly contemporary -- they hit you where you live! To hear Martha Wainright's schoolmarmish rendition of the immortal ""Singin' the Blues"" -- well, it would make me angry if I didn't know that in a few years this silly, if well-meaning CD will be history -- while Beiderbecke's music will continue to seduce new generations of listeners (like me) forever."
5,Golf cart cover,Great transaction! Everything as expected and would definately use this seller again in the future.
3,Decent for what it is...,"Ok, so I was introduced to the DJ Kicks series through Kruder & Dorfmeister and Thievery Corporation...from there I wandered on to get Erlend Oye's and Kid Loco's additions to the series. All were downtempo, and excellent.This is not downtempo. It reminds me of raving back in the early 1990's - while not a bad cd by any means, it was not what I expected. For what it is - an instrumental rave-worthy cd - it is not bad - but it is not for me."
1,Don't bother!,"This C.D. is not worth the time it will take you to read this review. If you are a fan of deep basslines and smooth transitions, please look elsewhere. I understand now why D.J.ing is strictly a form of recreation for Carl Craig, he does not have the ability to be a standout in the industry. The track selection is decent, but I believe his tinkering killed the overall feel of the sounds. Just not a wise purchase based on the fact there are much better electronica albums available."
2,Disappointed,"After having a tough time with my dogs allergies, I decided to give this product a try. I haven't. Noticed any changes. In my dogs skin or coat. Also it is almost impoossible to get her to eat it. Really hummed by this product."
2,"Not sure, mixed feelings about this.","I have a pug with chronic skin problems and I was really hoping that this would be the ""wonder"" product. He still has skin problems. I think his coat might be a little bit better but he still has lots of flakes and itchy skin."
5,Wonderful Stuff,This stuff will grow Hair on a Bucket....as my friend likes to put it. I am in dog rescue and we get many dogs coming in with skin and hair loss issues. Poor nutrition and low immune systems compound these problems. Adding Solid Gold Seameal in their food perks them right up and facilitates faster recovery for their skin issues and the re-growth of fur....beautiful fur! The Fatty Acids and fish oils really make their fur lustrous!! Like I said....it will Grow Hair on a Bucket!!!
5,Solid Gold Seameal,Great Product and was impressed with the quick delivery - like the other reviews said after a couple weeks my dogs hair started growing back.
1,Shameless Unproffessional Owner of this company,"Years ago I had my dog at a dog show where multiple vendors sold their products. I had just bought a sea kelp supplement from another vendor and then when I met Sissy Harrington-McGill from Solid Gold she saw me product and said ""that is from the North Sea and everyone knows that after Chernobyl all products from the North Sea are radio-active and you will kill your dog if you give him that. Unbelievable that someone would blatantly bash a competitor like that. The jet stream goes around the World clockwise or West to East and that area is pretty is North East of the accident. There may be radiation there from the accident and it would be fine if she said you should do some research about the accident and possible radiation contamination as oppose to saying if I give him this stuff he will die! FYI I did give him that stuff and for an Akita Husky male - he lived to about 12 which was pretty damn good for a big dog."
4,Easy Peasy,Was looking for a vitamin/mineral supplement for our Danes. This is great since I can mix it in their yogurt without worry about trying to hide a pill.
2,No noticeable effects,"Got this for my dog who has lymphoma and is undergoing chemo. My dog's been eating grass and sometimes dirt and other dog's poop, so I thought she was lacking a nutrient. I was going to just buy a multivitamin tablet but this was cheap with good reviews so I thought it would help.Its made of ground up seaweed with flaxseed meal and some dried pineapple flakes sprinkled in.My dog still eats grass after having been taking this supplement for 1 month.This supplement also makes me concerned about my dog's teeth. I think the pineapple flakes are acidic and make it easier for tartar to buildup on her teeth. Also the flakes become mushy when you mix it with warm water, as per the instructions. So when she eats it, theres this green flakey mush stuck inbetween my dog's teeth that's hard to clean out.So I dont like this product. I dont really see any effect, and it makes me worried about my dog's dental health. I'll stick to multivitamin tablets for my dog."
1,Useless,Did not live up to what it was supposed to do. I wanted a kelp suppelment only seaweed meal. Did not even notice a difference.
3,Good and Economical,"This is a good older scanner that makes decent quality scans. The scanner bed is about 8 1/2 by 11, so if you need to do legal sizes, you might want to reconsider. Overall, I am satisfied with this product. If you have Windows XP, you will need to download or order the updated software directly from HP as well as any patches. The CD that usually comes with the scanner will not work with this operating system. Even with the updated software, the scanner may not work as well as it does with Window 98, but it will work."
5,Wonderful outdoor yoga,"I really enjoy doing yoga outdoors, so when I saw a video that was filmed outdoors, I was really excited. And to my relief, the workouts were as nice as the scenery. I use this video to supplement marathon training and skiing in the winter. I have found that if I have a great video and can do it in my home I can afford to do yoga. Hopefully Kerry will make another video soon. My highest recommendation for those with some beginning yoga and pilates experience."
4,Wish it was longer!,"I really enjoyed the yoga part of this DVD (didn't try the Pilate's). My only complaint was that it didn't last long enough.The workout was very thorough and (even though it was only 40 min long) I worked up a pretty decent sweat. I enjoyed Kerry's voice and the picturesque scenery. I thought her instruction for getting into the poses was great and they were held for an advanced amount of time. Overall, I really enjoyed it and the time flew by. I also really like the opening meditation and love the shavasana at the end. I just wish she had made the yoga workout a little longer."
5,This one is keeping me very happy in bed.,"What a great read! As the youngest daughter growing up in Detroit, I grew up in a family that loved professional hockey and college football . . . I watched from the fringes. Hockey did intrigue me, but I never really got hooked into the sport. As I went through the bookstore recently I spotted this book on the Redwings. I saw that it was individual stories and I thought that might be a great way to get a taste for what I may have missed, since my family goes on and on about the Wings. So glad I made the purchase. What a wonderful read. A few stories each night before bed, what a great way to retire. Each one is insightful and I was really drawn in. Guess what, I think I'm hooked . . . I will now be attending some live games. Go wings!!!"
3,How(e) come Gordie is not featured?,"Very informative in reading the aspects and afterthoughts of quite a few of the Red Wing players, from over the years. However, very disappointed that Mr. Hockey himself, was not featured within this book. On that note alone, I probably would of not purchased the book . . . still though, it was quite an interesting read."
5,stanley cup book,"my grandson LOVED the book, even though they lost the 2009 stanley cup.i, too, enjoyed it."
4,A must for Red Wings fans,The players' passion for the sport and their Detroit franchise come through in this one. You get a real feeling for what it takes to make it to the top level of professional hockey and form a winning team. Probably not as of much interest to fans of other teams.
4,Great book for a Wings fan,I bought this book for my father who is a huge wings fan. It details in order historically the careers of key players and coaches and was the perfect father's day gift.
5,For my daughter,"My daughter started into hockey while going to Northern Michigan University. She then got hooked on the Wings. I was hoping that Art's book would introduce her to the culture of the Red Wings. She loves it. Thanks Art, miss you on the radio and hope you land on your feet soon.Mike from St Clair"
2,Mediocrity Celebrated,"Cory Morrow and Lloyd Maines deserve each other. They're both purely mediocre talents, and this CD lives up to every bit of that mediocrity. Maines' slick, souless production has found a soulmate in Morrow's slick, souless lyrics. This is a marriage made in mediocre heaven."
3,"Decent, cheap cards for the price.","I chose this product because it was cheaper than others. However, when you tear the cards apart, it leaves a bit of a rough edge. Probably higher quality (more expensive) ones would have torn cleanly. You can bypass this by using scissors to cut them instead, which is a little bit of a hassle, but what can you do.It was still definitely cheaper to buy these cards and print my own business cards than use any of the other services online. Plus, I was able to just print a sheet at a time, so if I need to update my information I can print new cards off later."
4,An unusual and cute bday gift,"My gf really liked this as a birthday gift. I call her ""giraffe"" because she's all legs and neck 8^) and has a lovely daughter."
4,Beautiful music!,I have downloaded it on my MP3 and listen to it at night when I'm unable to sleep. Great music with a message.
2,Chincy,"I am using these for gear attachment for diving, and they feel very chincy. I am disappointed with them. There is nothing wrong with them functionally, but this is an opinion...right?"
1,too good to be true,"The quality of picture was actually quite good, until the player stopped working altogether.I've had this 2 weeks. The first DVD I watched, the player kept freezing and had to be unplugged to unfreeze it. This did go away, but one week later, the system won't turn on at all.The sound quality was passable while it worked, but the satellite speakers barely added anything, and it took a lot of fiddling with the settings to get any sound out of the center or satellite speakers at all.All in all, you get what you pay for. It's a cheap and poorly constructed system that works ok at best, dies completely at worst."
4,cool flows,"this Mc throws down hot lyrics, burning up your stero. He has an Alternitve style, kind of a mix tupac and biggie"
2,product milled,"Both CDS were put through the mill obviously to get rid of defects. You can see the process by merely looking at them. The surfaces were scrubbed! However, I like the music."
4,floating candles,These candles are so beautiful and elegant. I used them for a tea party and everyone loved them. They were nicely packed and shipped very quickly.
5,Digetive woes thing of the past,"My husband has no gallbladder and as a result has difficulty digesting certain foods. Since taking Enzymatic Therapy Mega-zyme in addition to his probiotic supplement, he finds himself able to eat just about anything without digestive upset. An excellent product."
2,Enzymes no good,Not pleased with this product at all. Turns iut The units of activity is quite small and would take a lot more tablets to get any effect. Spend the money and get something that is at least measureable. In fairness I could not read the label entirely before but I bought it anyway.
4,"lots of information, no sources","While this book contained a lot of information, there were no sources cited so there was no way to follow-up on the information or to determine its accuracy."
3,World War II Sites in the United States,"A great reference for years ago. Unfortunately so much has been established over the past ten years regarding WWII history. This volume provides some interesting sites, however is very outdated. The some of the most major sites are not included, some should be even if they're not completed construction yet. Examples abound (these are only some): D-Day Museum New Orleans, WWII Memorial Washington DC, D-Day Memorial Bedford, VA, Bunkers Delaware Beaches, Bunkers at San Deigo, Goleta CA Japaneese Shelling site, Oregon Japaneese Bombing Site, North Carolina U-Boat Sites.Would be a great volume if updated."
5,Historical account yet clear and concise,"Although I was born after World War II, I lived on military bases throughout the U.S. My Osborne's book covers these long forgotten establishments - many of which had wartime populations exceeding 10,000 to 25,000 men and women. To the World War II historian, this book fills an extremely important niche."
1,A gift of acute pain for me and no acute talent for the author,"I received this book as a gift due to my proximity to the very same suburbs this hack is writing about, and found the work to be wretched in both style and content. I won't belabor the many failures this book holds, but suffice to say this fellow had a great agent and an idiot for an editor, otherwise this book should never have seen the light of day.The fact that most, if not all, of the favorible reviews were from one-time contributors leads me to suspect a shill-factor at work here. To steal from Salinger, if he was half the writer he thought he was (and believe me, his opinion thereof is quite substantial), he'd be lucky."
3,large in outer dimensions but not roomy inside,"if you expect this to be wide inside for you to put extra accessories, think again. the case is awkwardly large on the outside, and is not suited inside to fit more than you would wish beside carrying a laptop or a couple of books. Not recommended here! Get a Swiss Army or a Samsonite."
5,That Girl: Season Five,I grew up watching That Girl. It bringsback alot of happy memories watching allthe shows. I recommend this collection.
3,Brings back some great memories.,"The release of these DVDs bring back some great memories; however, I was let down a bit by Marlo's commentaries. I realize that, forty years on, she has quite a body of work behind her; yet as a fan you wait to hear such things as, ""I remember this!,"" or ""I remember Ted Bessell did this during shooting this scene..."", but she speaks about Ann Marie in the 3rd person, occasionally pointed out some dresses she liked, or that, ""Teddy Bessell was so thin then."" Her commentaries seem to suggest she has no independent recollection of the shows, so in that sense it will be a let down for fans and you may question the value of the commentaries."
5,That Girl Season 5,"I am so very happy that all seasons of That Girl"" are now on DVD. It is still very funny, both Ted and Marlo are great with physical humor and have great chemistry. I enjoy it even more than I did when this was on TV! I'm amazed at how well Marlo and the costumer chose her wardrobe, because nearly everything that she wears would look well, 44 years after the show began. It doesn't smack of cheesy sets as many series of the '60s and '70s do. Just the thing to see when you've had a bad day.In time, this should become a classic series, like ""I Love Lucy."" You love the characters and you can see how well they interact. I've enjoyed watching this with young children. Buy this today!!"
1,Rubbish,Narrative isn't too terrible. The anachronisms however make this utter rubbish and completely unreadable.
4,Great fiction but questionable history,"This was an enjoyable read.The recreation of Rome during the latter stages of the Republic is well done. Unfortunately the author actively alters history and there's the rub.Poetic licence is all well and good,but it rankles when the reader has some idea of the subject matter.I will definitely purchase the second volume if only to discover how the author deals with the subject of Octavius(Caesar's nephew) the future Augustus.In the novel Mr.Iggulden makes Julius an only child!"
4,Informative and entertaining,"I enjoyed relearning the history of this era while being thoroughly entertained by the intriguing plot. As an avid reader of modern day fiction, I selected this book as a welcome change of pace. I was not disappointed."
1,Horrible Historical,"After completing this work it appears obvious that the author was actually writing an alternate history scenario but lacked the confidence to market his effort without the necessity of positioning it in the guise of a historical novel.Unfortunately, the life of Julius Caesar whether related by anyone from Suetonius to Colleen McCullough is more interesting and complex in fact and fiction than anything that ""Emperor"" approaches.I would suggest that this poorly designed effort will be of more interest to Hollywood for the next lavishly produced, big budget, historically inaccurate feature than anyone seriously interested in gaining some insight into the life and times of one of history's greatest men."
2,"Et tu, Iggulden?","Honestly, I couldn't care less about the ""historical accuracy"" of this book. It's fiction. I bought it because I thought it might be a good fiction book, if I wanted a history book I would have bought one. But the writing is very amateurish, the only time the writing seems to come alive is when Iggulden is writing huge battle scenes. Other than that, it's very bland. Now I'm looking for a better historical fiction book about Rome!"
2,had promise but disappointing,"As someone who loves books about ancient Rome, I was excited to read this book. The book starts out strongly with a description of Caesar's childhood, and while I liked the author's narrative ability, I couldn't get passed the historical inaccuracies. I had just finished reading October Horse and so knew a great deal about Caesar and this book just takes too many liberties with Caesar's childhood, Marius, the identity of Caesar's boyhood friend, and Sulla's march on Rome.I suggest the Masters of Rome series instead."
2,emperor I,"I bought all three of these books. I hope they get better but book one leaves a whole lot to be desired. I can deal with the fact it is not remotely historically accurate, but a little closer would have been nice. Its just really not a particularly well written book in general. Its kind of silly. If you like simple writing and simple characters, this probabaly is not bad, but I normally like a bit more challange to my reading. And Caesar could hardly be thought of as a simple man. Its more like an overly long children's book. It does not make the reader anxious to read on, it just kind of drags. Its not bad, its just not good."
4,Fiction vs. facts,"The book is simply great. It takes us very well through the early years of two most prominent figures of Roman History. A few regrets though: the storytelling is not at the height of the challenge. There are some anachronisms in the book writing style and it should have been taken care of. Also, History could have been respected a little more to the point ; at least to respect the great characters and their lives that make up this beautiful novel... More to come and soon I hope!!!"
5,Wonderful,This is one of the best books I have read in some time. It is hard to believe that it is by a first time novelist.
2,Iggulden is a poor man's McCullough,"So you don't have the time or inclination to read Colleen mcCullough's books, well, never fear, Conn Iggulden is here. Although the author takes over 300 pages to mention Julius Caesar's name, it shouldn't take more then a few pages for someone with a rudimentary knowledge of history to figure out who the protagonist is.I'm not sure why people are gushing about how good this book is. I agree it is a fast read and the author does try to stay historically accurate, but this is not a Tale of Two Cities.If you want good writing, read McCullough. If you want a mindless, somewhat interesting read, pick up Iggulden's book."
5,it is historical,First off at the end of the book the author explains what was changed and the reasons for it. And I don't think Caesar had any sisters Octavian or Augustus was adopted.
2,complex but thin,"I found this novel to be a little thin in terms of characterization. The plot line was okay, and kept the story line moving, but overall the reader just isn't engaged with the story. There are enough characters, major and minor, to be of interest, but they were either cliche driven or simply two dimensional. I read through to the end, not because I cared about the characters, but because it was the first in a series and I wanted to see how the following novels were set up. I also felt the historic references to place, culture and events more cursory than interesting. It seemed that the research had been done, but only on the surface."
2,Randolphin2,"I just could not finish this book! Maybe if I had not read the great series by Colleen McCullough first I could have gotten through it. The historical mayhem this author perpetrates on the Roman empire is mind boggling. This is not historical fiction, just pure fiction."
1,Horrible History,"Other than the fact that Marcus Brutus was a generation younger, rumored to be Caesar's son and came from a family of wealth and mobility, him being Caesar's boyhood friend made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I was going to suggest that my 15 year old read this as an historical novel but forget it. Even children's books on this subject matter reveal these gross errors in history. Where will Caesar's nephew Octavius come from when Caesar has no sibling? Another stupid error."
1,Emperor: The Gates of Rome,Unless you dont care about historical inaccuracies this is not worth the read. Although it was easy to read and maybe even entertaining it is so riddled with historical mistakes or liberies that I wouldn't reccomend that anyone with no knowledge of the time period read it.
2,Not even close.,"While this was entertaining fiction it most certainly was in no context historical. Maybe it is the history major in me, but I could not he past how far off almost everything was: The timeline of events, character ages (which are significant), The Social War was not even mentioned. If you are looking for something to read over the weekend this will be great. If you want something to learn from and be entertained read McCoullough."
1,Like I was robbed,"It's my own fault for not reading any of these reader reviews first. Unfortunately I bought the entire Emperor series at once before opening this first book. By the time I hit Caesar as a teenager during Marius' third term as consul I knew I had garbage in my hands. Marius' third term was about 100BC, the same year Caesar was born. And Marius and Sulla each trying to force the other to march off to fight Mithridates is a complete reversal of the facts. I've never burned a book, but I might have a pile of them to burn now."
1,Terrible time-waster!,"I would have been willing to overlook the glaring historical inaccuracies in this book if the story had been engrossing and well written. But, life is too short to read something so trashy. As recommended by others, read the The First man in Rome series if you want historically accurate, well- written stories about interesting people."
2,wasted time,"I love reading of Rome, the Republic and the Empire. I dove into this book expecting a rehashing of the same story. I was wrong. Oh, so wrong. I am aghast at the historical inadequacies. This book is poison to those who want to read history, and poison to those who want to read adventure. Slow, stodgy, jumpy, and infantile. Iggulden is a lightweight, and should stick to romances. Once again, I have wasted my time."
3,Hard to be fair,"This is a decent, easy-reading adventure story. But it purports to be based on history, and gets the history all wrong. So what really is the point?"
1,no historical in this fiction,"When I heard that Bernard Cornwall gave this book a favirable revew I thought it might be a good historical fiction. How could I have known that Bernard Cornwall didn't read this book, he must not or else why would soil his name with this book. Outside of the names of the historical characters there was no historical accuracy in this book. This book should be labled as a fantasy not a historical novel. I have read many of the ancient sources and some of the modern ones, none of them resembled this in any way. For anyone who wants to read real historical novels on Ceaser read Colleen McCullough masters of Rome series instead of this tripe"
1,"an utter, inexcusable mess","I'm a strong fan of historic fiction, but this book is the very antithesis of what historic fiction should be: it's not even sloppily researched, but simply not researched at all, making no attempt whatsoever to put the historical figures it uses as characters in anything like a reasonable or believable historical context. To cap it off, it's not wortwhile fiction even if you manage to totally ignore the historical counterparts of its characters -- no credible or interesting character development, no plot to hold any level of sustained interest, sloppy prose. I wish the stars-rating system allowed for negative numbers, because that's what this one would require."
1,Badly written and historically inaccurate,"As an adult, I think this book was very badly written. The characters are stereotypical, and the story is not credible. This book reminds me of some of the bad fantasy books I used to read when I was younger (unlike excellent fantasy books like 'A Game of Thrones' which I can read today).If the book was well written, I could forgive it for being historically inaccurate. And it IS historically inaccurate. Iggulden seems to have taken some main events and names of famous historical personalities, and then created his own fictive world based on those events and names. The names of famous personalities are there. Their personalities and relatinships, however, are not. This fault of Iggulden's books seems all the more glaring today, when I can compare them to the excellent television series 'Rome'. This series shows that you CAN create a fascinating story while staying more true to historical facts than Iggulden."
1,Disappointing Read,"I found this book more irritating than anything else. First the history is grossly innacurate. After reading the Masters of Rome series, learning about the time of Marius and Caesar have become a hobby for me. I was delighted to find another book on this pet subject of mine, but right into the story I became derailed with young Caesar growing up on an estate, outside of Rome. Then it gets worse (Marius an uncle on his mother's side, in the walls of Rome and asking for a Triumph) Ungh! But I read on hoping that at least the story would be good, but I'm dissapointed in that too. Total let down, this book is supposedly the first in a series, usually something I read to the very last book, but not this time. Just too bad, really."
2,more fiction than fact,Iggulden manages to totally rewrite history for no apparent reason. This book is entertaining if you don't care to know anything about actual Roman history. Please buy The First Man in Rome before you ever think about picking up this book.
5,One of My Favorites!,Love Crazy is one of my favorite films with William Powell and Myrna Loy. It has everything a romantic comedy or screw-ball comedy of the day was supposed to have! Great repartee between the two stars and even the side characters; characters that you like; witty dialogue; plenty of slapstick; mistaken identies and situations; a man in drag; people acting crazy and a very amusing storyline!Jack Carson adds greatly to the comedy elements as do several other character actors. From start to finish this picture never takes a misstep.
4,Not as good as the first one but good music for entertaining,Great for entertaining / cocktails / dinner party. Stylish and sexy. Just a shame it doesn't quite live up to the first one which is my all-time favorite.
3,Can anyone help me?,"I don't own this CD, but I fell in love with her song ""We Can Fly Away"" the first time I heard it,in the movie ""Magical Legend of the Leprechauns"", and I've been looking for that song ever since. If anyone can give me any information on where to find it, please e-mail me at Noodlebug339@aol.com. I would really appreciate it."
2,Absolutely insufferable,"Emma Townshend, better known as the daughter of Pete Townshend, has released an absolutely insufferable debut album. Winterland is trite, pompous without a cause, and over-produced to its rotten core. Her voice is remininscent of a canary in its death throes, and her piano playing leaves much to be desired, even for an afficiando of minimalist expression such as myself. I found this used at a local record store, but even for five dollars, I feel that I've been shafted. Steer clear.Note: The additional star is for Ms. Townshend's excellent taste in poetry, but I would imagine that poor Emily Dickinson is rolling over in her grave."
5,An Admirable Effort towards Delineating the Spirit World!,Sinistrari was a devout Catholic who strongly believed in the existence of spirits and demons in the late 17th century. This book goes into extraordinary detail outlining entities known as incubi and succubi and all manners of other demonic spirits that plagued mankind and led him into temptation. Summers translation from Latin is a good one. It is an interesting and captivating exploration into evil and the hierarchy of the spirit world.
4,The One-Round War: USMC Scout-Snipers In Vietnam,A good in depth book about the Marines and their Snipeing equipment and problems they had to work out with them.
1,Does not work,"The two dudes must be paid reviewers, because I've tried three of these and none worked well. Wasted a few disks and the ones I did burn could not play on my Apex player. This is still new technology so go with something more mature."
2,History,The film was too repetetive and for someone who is not too interested in the fine details of the union v capitalists it was long drawn out and boring.
3,well.....,"I don't know exactly what Dj Hell was trying to do mixing tracks that totally clashed with each other, and at the very end got a lil' self indulgent with his own releases. I'm sorry to say the mixing wasn't very good either... the tracks are excellent choices, but should be mixed/blended better...."
3,Not Much Good For Educators,"This book has a collection of experiments which draw from other grossology books. (Some of the actual experiments are in the other books.) I have used a lot of the Grossology books in my classroom to really help turn on kids to science, but this particular book is more suited to at home fun. If you have the other books in the series, this one wouldn't be worth it."
2,Horrible,"I was expecting more because of the good reviews, but these are the worst sounding speakers I have ever heard. It comes with a wired remote that controls volume for the front and rear. The front speakers and sub are controled by the same knob. Every time you turn up the volume you turn up the sub, which is the most muffled sounding sub I have ever heard in my life. It sounds like it's blown. I tried playing music on my comp and the only way to make it sound close to decent is adjusting the sound using an EQ. The sound was just as bad when I tried watching a DVD. The sub made each characters voice sound like ""burr burr burrr"". Avoid buying these speakers. I will be returning mine as soon as possible. Invest in some better quality ones. I previously had a set of ""Altec Lansing ATP3 2.1"" . Those sounded awesome and were about the same price."
2,Half a book,"Agree with Irish --- big mistake to lose the punctuation and spacing. As big as it would be with Cummings or Williams. I was surprised at Ishmael -- the power comes from watching the mind work out issues on the page, shown in the rhetoric and the spacing / syntax. Good to have the arguments, annoying to miss the power and intent. This is, alas, only half a book."
1,I was stunned into silence,"by how amateur and poorly done this DVD was. It comes in a plain white case, wtih what looks like a home printer label pasted on the outside, and on the disk itself. The camera is virtually all hand held-think ""Blair Witch Project"" meets an island travelogue and you'll get a sense of this. Right out of the player into the trash! I loved the IMAX one-spend your money on that."
1,what a rip off,This was by far the worst DVD in quality and content that I have ever seen. It was far worse than any home video I've ever seen. Don't waste your money!
1,BAD!,"I watched this with a friend whom I wanted to show the beauty of Ecuador. After the first 5 minutes of astonished silence, we laughed for the following 5 while watching the worst piece of travel documentary ever made. After ten agonizing minutes, embarassement settled in and we gave our TV a break and threw this piece of trash into the garbage. Give my six year old child a glass eye, a bottle of Pisco and an old super-8 camera and he is bound to do a better job than this utter rubbish!"
4,It's pretty good,"The sensitivity isn't very good, even with a boost. It doesn't sound that great, but it's cheap and it works."
2,Broken after 3 months.,I purchased the mic and when it's functioning is a great mic for the price. Everyone on my vent server had no problem hearing anything I said. Today I turn on my PC and it just doesn't work. I tested in vent and skype with no success. The computer recognizes that it's plugged in but no sound. I tested other mics to make sure it wasn't my PC and it's the mic that's the problem. I knew I was getting cheap but I didn't expect only 3 months of use.
4,not as sensitive as i would like,"its not as sensitive as i would like, but im using it for xbox 360 and you need a certain level of sound to make the mic detect your talking. it does work.. i just have to talk a little louder, using it with my tritton decoder box. everyuone was saying the cords so long and mines only about 4 ft. overall good quality tho"
4,"Wish this had a better clip, but otherwise excellent.","I purchased this for online gaming, some minor recording, and commentary; it outperformed my wildest expectations; the quality of the microphone is amazing, and it works well in concert with the rest of my system.I ended up making a clip for myself out of some Aluminum wire after I found that it did not fit well onto my headphone wire; this made all the difference; no plosives, or annoying whooshing noises as I talked, and just the right level of noise control."
1,Stopped working after two weeks,"It just stopped working. No external damage was done. I guess, I got what I paid for :( Will be looking for something more expensive/reliable"
4,Good quality microphone,"This microphone was great, would wrap the wire around the headphones and clip it at the very top of the wire. It didn't have any sound leakage and worked great. Only thing that was annoying was the mic kept un-clipping."
2,"Mike clip doesn't clip, but good sound recording","Well, all the reviews were accurate and I thought...what's the big deal about the mic clip? Well, it's a nuisance! The mike clip is of hard placed and fixed with a 1/4 inch gap..it can not attach to a shirt or collar. So unless you can easily find another mike clip, your gonna be holding this mike in your hand to do the recording-- or suspend it from above."
2,Poor build quality,"Out of the box it seemed good enough. However, two problems emerged:1. The ""clamp"" part of the device isn't adjustable in any way (it's stiff/fixed) and, as in my case, may not fit your headphone cable. I use Bose Noise Canceling headphones and had to wrap tape around the cord in order to thicken it, so the Zalman mic would actually attach.2. After only a few weeks of use, the mic cord completely came away from the mic.When in use, it worked well, but as I said build quality and design needs improvement."
3,Just acceptable.,"It works, but it picks up all the background noise and then some. Wouldn't really recommend this one at all. If you want to record sound and don't care about high background static and sound pickup, this is acceptable. Otherwise, pass."
4,"It's a mic, it works, and it's cheap","Title pretty much sums it up. It's a mic, it works fairly well, not too quiet, not too loud. The cord is nice and long, but a bit thin, I can see it getting smashed or breaking if you're too rough with it, but it's acceptable for an item of this price. It paired nicely with my Audio Technica ATH-M50. I slid the cord inside the coiled part, and clipped the mic to the straight part for a '1 piece' setup.I'd rate it a 5, but the cord is just too thin for a perfect 5, so 4 it is."
5,"Easy to use, and great sound quality.","I bought this mic for a replacement of my headset when I wanted to use my HD555 headphones or just to sit on my desk when I didn't want to use a headset. The people in Vent say that my voice is crystal clear and get nearly no back ground noise when its just sitting on my desk a 1.5 feet from my speakers. I was hoping that I could pin it to my shirt when I was playing, but its not needed when I found out that it doesn't pick up much background noise."
3,Good mic,"This mic is great for using headphones without mics as headsets. However, the clips don't work well with my headphones (Bose QC15). I had to add some padded tape to the clip to make it stay on. Also, these pick up tons of background sound; when they say high sensitivity, they mean it. It would be nice to have some noise cancelling feature, but oh well. Overall pretty good for a cheap microphone."
5,Great microphone,"This microphone is great for turning a headphone into a headset. I put these on my Sennheiser HD555's and it works great. The only downside is that the clips don't always stay on, but that's not much of a problem as you can just wrap electrical tape around several points of the two wires."
2,Sensitive?,Not happy with this one. For starters the clip on it is a real pain; it attaches only to fatter cables and is poorly designed.My real problem though is that the sensitivity of the mic is absolutely horrid. I planned to use this mic as part of my main online gaming rig but the quality has me saving it as a fallback.I would have liked to use my Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones with this but have since ordered the Plantronics GameCom 777 headset. One set of wires makes me MUCH happier also.
1,Bad Mic,"As soon as i opened the box, i knew this was going to be a waste of my time.But i wanted to disprove my theory and i immediately tried these out.As i was testing them, i realized the only way i could be heard ingame and inskype,Aim,etc. was if i hold the microphone RIGHT NEXT to my mouth. I also googled for help and got none.horrible microphones, wouldn't recommend these."
3,Disappointed,"I just received this microphone in the past week. I was hoping to find something that I could use in conjunction with my Bose headphones since they are much better quality and more comfortable than my current headset. The clip size was too big for the wire on my headphones, but that was no big deal as I just increased the diameter of the wire with some electrical tape. I was able to position the microphone quite close to my mouth, but I still got a lot of comments from my friends about sounding like I was talking from the bottom of a fish bowl. I have both the mic volume and boost settings maxed out, along with trying every conceivable filtering option from the Realtek drivers. It doesn't matter. The only time the microphone sounds good is when I hold it out directly in front of my mouth with my hand, but that defeats the purpose for something that is supposed to clip on to the wire. I'm glad it wasn't expensive, since I'll need to find another solution."
3,Decent but quiet,The mic clips onto the wire of your headset and if thats not very close to your mouth you're going to have trouble getting it loud enough. Also the additional clips along the headset are not very large so make sure you dont have a thicker headphone cable because it cannot clip onto those. The audio quality itself is fine.
3,Ok mic that works good with ATH-AD700,I use this mic with ATH-AD700. The problem with the mic is that its not strong enough. You have to turn on Mic Boost in Windows so that it can actually pick up what you are saying. If you don't care about having a mic next to your headphone then I would look somewhere else. If you just want an inexpensive mic that works ok then this is a good buy.
2,Terrible sound,"Low quality microphone that does not clip onto headphones with nicer cords. Way too sensitive, as in picks up any background noise, and adjusting prooved useless. Would be good for a completely silent environment but other than that would not recommend."
1,Not for use with Astro Mixamp,There are a lot of positive reviews on this mic for gaming. I tried it with my Astro mixamp and Ultrasone headphones. Unless the mic was right on my mouth the audio was indecipherable.
4,"Good sensibility, but bad way to plug","The microfone is pretty good, sound quality is better than normal microphones. Its worthy. Only problem is they dont have a way to attach it to a headphone, shirt or something .. its just a cord and nothing .. so, I have to use that kinda grabbed in my shirt or around my neck, like hanging .. Anyway, its not a huge problem for me, considering I just use that in my PC, its ok, but if you plan use that outside or to something else, remember it."
3,Not much competition,"I've owned two and a friend who is very careful with their things has owned one.Pros-Cheap-Hard to find any competition without bumping price range up considerablyCons-Cheaply constructed. Will die fast (~6-8 months, maybe less.)-Picks up everything in your room. That means it sounds like some light static is in the background, it will pick up keyboard noise very loudly, and it will pick up your computer.I'm really not sure why it is so hard to find decent microphones in the $15-$30 range that aren't attached to cheap headsets. I've used ~$100 sennheiser headphones for years, and after the last of my headset microphones died I used two of these. I ultimately decided to just get a $70 microphone, but that's rather excessive when I wasn't looking for particularly high quality just something that didn't pick up my keyboard at the same level as my voice."
4,so far so good,"Our 20 year old thinks it's ok. She uses it to Skype, and considering the microphones at the big package store were $30 this microphone is pretty easy to like. I'm not sure if this will hold up long but so far so good."
2,It worked for 2 days..,At first it was quite the little microphone.I really liked it but I decided to try it out for a little longer before reviewing it.Unfortunately after two days and (barely any use) its ability to capture sound went from decent to mediocre to crippled.I remember before I bought it someone had said you had to put almost inside your mouth for it to work.Well I thought he or she was kidding but upon use I have come to see that my microphone has faced the same fate.A bit funny I agree but not 12 bucks funny T_T
4,wonderful mic and small too!,"I absolutely love this zalman clip on microphone! It is very light and mobile, unlike bulky microphones. Great for gaming or making calls via instant messaging clients. Sound quality is great! The only thing that I dislike about it is, the clip is meant for slightly thicker than normal headphone wires... so make sure your headphones have a slightly thicker wire so the zalman mic won't be hanging like a dead flower/leaf. other than that.. wonderful microphone."
3,Good Not Great,"I purchased this microphone with the intention of using it with an existing pair of headphones for online gaming.For the most part, this microphone works, but its placement, at least on my particular headphones (which only have a single wire coming from the left ear), made my voice sound faint and distant. Other players complained that they were having trouble hearing my voice in game.Overall, for the price, it isn't a bad microphone. However, its placement when paired with my headphones did not make it an optimal choice for gaming."
2,Not up to typical Zalman Quality,"This mic simply picks up too much background noise. I used it once and never used it again...not worth returning, however since it was pretty cheap."
4,Simple and useful,"I must confess I do not use this microphone in the manner for which it was done. I can not use the clip on the cable, so I hung around my neck (the cable quite generous). It grabs the sounds with flawlessly reception, But sometimes also loud noises coming from outside my room."
2,Misleading product,"if you thought you could convert your standard headphones into one with a mic simply attached, you were wrong. The clip doesn't fit the standard headphone or earbud cord thickeness. Instead, i had to duc-tape them so they'd attach. The mic is decent for short commands but filled with complaints of static feedback when using it for casual online chats.Save your money for a headset with a built in mic."
4,Decent Sound Quality,"I use this in my car with a Y adapter to create a ""hands-free"" way of using my cell phone.It's better than some other mics I've tried, but it does pick up background noise. If I weren't in a Lexus, I probably couldn't use this in my car. Of course, this mic is designed as a gaming accessory and not for auto use."
3,"No mute, and actually does need to be close to sound good.","I expected too much for a $10.00 mic, but the fact that there is no way to mute the mic, and also that I had to mount it to my old boom just to get it near enough to my mouth to sound good. We bought 3 of these, and all three of us on different machines have the same problem with Battlelog. It sounds ok in other programs like Skype and Teamspeak, but we all have had to mess with it a ton to get it decent.*3/5, because of no mute, and the fact it needs to be close, even with boost set to +10 through +20."
3,"Great design if mine had worked, but DOA","Bought this to pair with my 598HD's, however it could hardly pick up my voice(and that was only if held directly in front of my mouth). I tried 3 different devices to make sure it wasn't another hardware's fault and the mic it self. Often times windows showed the mic was plugged in, but not usable. Finding no way to make it useable I returned it to amazon for a refund and bought theAntLion ModMic Attachable Boom Microphoneinstead. Though it cost more, its a superior design and worked out of the box for me."
3,Okay for the money,I bought this product because it was cheap. I wasn't expecting much and I was right. It's hard to attach it correctly in some instances and the sound detection is spotty at most.
3,Its ok for a microphone.,"The overall mic sound quality is pretty good, but the cord is a little too ling for comfort. The entire mic/cord comes with up to 4 clips on it meant to ""tidy"" up cables, but they're made of rubber and not plastic, and are only able to clip on the thicker cords. I do not have an audio-out set of headphones/earphones that can take advantage of these clips. Seeing as its also so long, I couldn't really combine it with my sets either way."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"Easily the best microphone for the price. Voice is very clear and I have never had a single person complain that I was quiet or fuzzy on Ventrilo, Skype or streaming.My only complaint is that the clip is not very good. It is rigid plastic that can't adjust and doesn't fit on my headphone cable, but leaving it lying on my desk doesn't seem to hinder it's usage."
2,Decent enough mic... when it works.,"Considering it costs less than $10, this mic is actually decent quality - friends on Teamspeak/Ventrilo can hear me just fine. The problem is that it doesn't last. I've owned two of these microphones now, and both have died within about a month of use. Unless you're in the market for disposable microphones, it's probably worth paying a little more to find a mic that will last longer than this."
4,Need a loud voice,"Not sensitive to a soft voice. Need to speak in full voice (not good for cubicles; OK for at home). On-line others could not hear me, so I had to tape the mic to my face right by my mouth. Then I figured out just to talk loud. I'm keeping it, but the ""high sensitivity"" description does not fit with how it picks up sound."
3,"Dull hissing sound, you get what you pay for","This mic is a great little mic to pic up people talking. The sound quality kind of stinks though, but what ever like it. I would only pay $10 for this item."
4,Pretty Much What You'd Expect,I picked this up because I needed a clip mic and I needed to spend $10 more to qualify for free shipping. There's nothing inherently wrong with this mic. It slides on your headphone cord and has small rubber clips that clip on the length of the cord so long as your cord isn't much thicker than standard. My Grado SR-60i's have Ron Jeremy's girth so I can't use them. The Zalman logo bezel is a little smaller than a dime and the entire mic/clip assembly is a little bigger than a nickel and is somewhat attractive on a black cord. The mic cord is really long and thin. Sound quality is on par with mics found on most midrange headsets.
4,Decent mike,"For the cheap price I think it's pretty good in quality. I bought this because my laptop webcam's built in micwas not loud enough. Since it's not connected to a USB, I don't have to worry about running out of USB slots on my laptop. I can just connect it to the mic slot and I don't have to install anything. When I was searching for a mic I wasn't looking for anything fancy, but just a mic that would enhance the volume when I'm using Skype. For the cheap price, it does what I bought it for.One drawback would be the clip on, where it might be good when you're wearing a dress shirt with buttons, but not on a T shirt. I only use this mic at home, so I'm always in comfortable clothes, mostly T shirts. There is no way to adjust the clip on so it doesn't clip on to a T shirt."
5,Works great with Mixamp/PS3 combo!,Works pretty good with Mixamp 2010 and PS3. Was pretty reluctact to purchase it first because I read reports that it does not work well with console. So I'm a happy camper now.I found a good way to reduce the wire clutter by having the clip mic twirl around my headphone.
2,Awful,"I bought these to clip on my new headphones, go look somewhere else, honestly it was a waste of $13. The ""clip"" is pathetic and doesn't clip on anywhere that you can be heard from, the inline clips won't fit over anything bigger than it's chord, and it's chord is frighteningly skinny."
3,Not as good as I would hope,I purchased this mic expecting amazing performance but was let down when all my friends said I sounded garbled. After some fiddling around I found they understood me better when I actually flipped the mic in the opposite direction of my mouth. They come with clips running all the length of the mic's cable but where WAY too small to fit my headphones cable proving pointless and a nuisance when I used a sleeve to bind my cables together because they do not detach and create a unnecessary bulge.Give me a boom mic over zalman's any day of the week.
1,Complete Garbage,"These have maybe 1/10th the sensitivity they claim. I ordered three of them, and all three fail to receive anything under any configuration with 3 different computers."
3,Ridiculously Long Chord,"The cord on this is really, really long. Bought this as an up-sell with my ATH-AD700 headphones. FYI: Plug doesn't fit Xbox controller, requires an adapter. I didn't really need this device I guess."
1,Zalman Zm-Mic1,I gave this one star because nobody can hear me very well when I'm playing in games. I sound muffled and quiet.Everyone complains how bad it sounds and it doesn't matter where I attach it still sounds the same.
4,No clip,It's nice but doesn't come with an actual clip to attach on to your clothing. Check the YouTube review. The clip that it comes with attaches to wires I.e. headphones
1,Sounds like you are 5 feet away from the mic,Just awful. I have to tilt my head down just so people can hear me.I wouldn't recommend to anyone. What a joke
2,"Expected better, but at least it was cheap.","This microphone is compact, easy to use, and affordable. However, its performance is very spotty; sometimes, my voice comes in clear and booming, but most of the time the other party couldn't make out what I was saying. Switching between Windows and Linux didn't help, nor did bumping up the mic boost in the audio controls.Long story short, save your money and purchase a dedicated headset with a mic, or buy a decent desk mic."
3,Good when it works,"The mic is nice and works just fine for a short time, the only upside is that when it dies every 4/5 months, its only $5 to replace."
5,Just works,The whole thing is simple no buttons no weird stuff just plug in and use to play your favorite games.
4,"They really do mean,""High sensitivity""","Eh, well, first off id like to mention i paired this with my ATH-A700's, at first, people on vent would say i sounded muffled and that my voice was low pitched. The reason for this being that since it was clipped on to my cord to my headphones, it was pointing at my throat, thus picking up the noise from my throat and not my mouth. So, to remedy this, i took it off my cord and rigged up a little stand for it to sit on my desk and point at my mouth, my friends on vent said it sounds clear and comes through nicely (keep in mind the mic is now 3 feet from my face with no mic boost)Pros: Good mic solution if you're a gamer using cans, sound quality is pretty good, far better then i expected from a 10 dollar mic.Cons: Bit of a nit pick... but the cable is EXTREMELY long, but i was aware of that when i purchased it. Its also, as i said, very sensitive and very ""directional"", so you may have to come up with something as i did.Conclusion: All in all, a good purchase!"
4,Good mic for the price,"I bought this mic last year, and I used it daily for about seven months before it broke.However, for the price, I would say that it was worth it. It was easy to use, and the quality was fine for chatting (ie. skype calls and gaming which is what I used it for). I would definitely recommend it if you just need a decent mic to attach to your headphones, but just be wary that they may not last much more than half a year."
1,Not worth it,"Wanted a mic that I could clip onto my Q701's and stumbled upon the Zalman. My main use for it is Skype, and to a lesser extend, online games. While the mic does clip onto my headphone wire securely, that is about all it does well. The mic itself does not pic up sound very well, I felt like I was always having to yell into in. The sound quality is also pretty lackluster(fuzzy speech and lots of background noise). To top things off, after a about 2 months of light use the mic randomly became ultra sensitive and as was reverberating sound like a mofo, even with sensitivity set to the lowest. In light of this I threw it away. Some people say you get what you pay for however before this mic I used a 10$ desktop mic that lasted 3 years, while the Zalman only lasted through 2 months of use. Buyer beware."
3,"Good, but with issues","I found that the recording quality for this product was really good, but unfortunately the part that clips onto the cord isn't adjustable. My headphones have a smaller thinner cord then most headsets, and so the static generic sized clip doesnt fit on my headphones. So instead of having it clip onto my headphones cord like it was designed to, I have to drape it over my neck, or find something like a twisty tie to stick it to my headphones cord. Not ideal. If I had a different headset that it would work as designed, I would give it a 5 star rating."
3,You get what you pay for,"It isn't horrible, but it is what you would expect for the price. Arrived in good time and works fine. But the sound quality isn't extremely good. But that isn't a complaint. It is just how it is with the price of such a product."
2,Zalman Zm-Mic1 X2,"This review is being done after the second Zalman mic has died. I say died because the first one acquired a problem just after the mic to pc adapter causing no sound other than static during use. Now the second replacement for that mic has succumbed to the same fate, the mic jack has developed the same problem. I know what you're thinking, what about your setup? The microphone is plugged in the rear of my PC tower, and has nothing but gravity pulling on the cord. No trauma could have caused this issue due to the use of a cord manager.The sound quality prior to this inevitable problem was decent and served it's purpose quite well."
2,"Very poor quality mic, would not recommend","The plastic connector is meant for a certain wire gauge, no larger than what you would find on the generic headphones you receive with an iPod.This microphone is very cheap (thought this as a pro at first, not a con) and has proved extremely difficult to use. It never seems to want to pick up my voice no matter how sensitive I make it. I would not recommend this product to anyone wanting to communicate with another human as this seems impossible. YES I have tried (for several hours) to set up this microphone, including taking advice from the other reviews. I may have received a defective product but it's really not worth sending back for only 8 dollars."
2,"Absolutely not ""High Sensitivity""","I bought these with ATH-AD700 headphones hoping to get a good microphone that will clip onto the wire. I clipped it onto the wire and tested it out to see how it sounded. To my surprise I couldn't hear it all. I figured maybe it was drivers or something in the Windows settings. It's honestly just not picking up my voice. So I figured I'd just try holding it up to my mouth with my hand and try it out. Putting it right up to my mouth made it sound like I was whispering from 10 meters away. I increased the microphone volume in WIndows and it STILL was barely picking up my voice, let alone enough to understand what I was saying. To me this mic is truly unusable. It deserves to be labelled as a ""low sensitivity"" microphone because of how bad it is at picking up my voice at a normal speaking volume."
2,Find something better,"Thing is like 20 feet long, and the clip is retarded. The pictures make it look sick, but it's not. It's hard to clip on, it's not even a clip. It's just a gap of plastic where you have to jam your headphone cord or whatever in between it. If your cord isn't thick enough, fold it and try again. It's a piece of s***t really is what it is."
2,Didn't work for me,"Used to talk to other gamers by clipping it onthe cord of HD555 headphones, nobody could hearme. I kept moving the cable to bring the micto my mouth.I now use a 25 year old boom micIdentical to the ""Jensen Desktop Boom Mic""Amazon sales for $5.2 stars because I'm sure I can one daytape it to the end of a stick and itbe useful (seriously)."
5,Great overal mic.,"It snaps right to my head phone line and does a great job whether I'm gaming or skyping. Nice pick up, full bodied sound, I sound like me instead of a 12 year old talking into a paper cup. 10/10"
3,Great price for the quality,"This isn't a bad microphone, but it's not a great one. There's not much background noise in the mic, and it picks up your voice fairly well. The main issue with this microphone is there is no adjustment for the clipping onto the headphone wire. If you have a nice thick wire coming out of your headphones then you should be okay. In addition, you can't actually angle the microphone so you're going to be a little softer in voice to your friend. I have a pair of Grado Labs SR 60 headphones if you want to look up how thick the cable is coming from my headphones are."
3,Works as advertised,"Nothing outstanding. I have no complaints. I use it for voice chat for online gaming. Hooks right up to your ear phone cord. descent sound, i never notice it is there"
3,Good mic,"The ZM Mic1 is a good choice if you have a low budget looking for decent quality mics. It's clip can be a bit of a pain in the ass if you don't have a cord to attach it to (I personally hate clipping things on to my shirt), and sometimes if you step on the cord and try to get up you can accidentally rip it right off of where it was clipped which can be a bit annoying. Other than that, this mic has above standard sound quality and a nice, long cord. Unfortunately it doesn't have a mute button and it is NOT noise-cancelling, so some embarrassing moments may get overheard by your online friends. Definitely not the best mic I have ever purchased, but it IS worth it if you have a low budget and need a small clip on mic."
1,misleading,"I would not call this a chair cushion....it is much too small..more like a minature pillow, for children!"
3,not exactly comfortalbe(goes with green hamick),I bought a hammik for my parents that this pillow goes to. They dont' even use it(the pillow I mean). It is hard and uncomfortable and doesn't stay put under my head(though I use it for reading).
1,Crummy Chair Cushion,"I purchased two cushions to use on small chairs. When the cushions I arrived, I could hardly believe how small they were, smaller than the description stated. In addition to the small size, the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions."
5,The perfect fit,I have been very pleased with my hammock chair this past summer. The pillow was a real bonus. My kids and I can hang out in the yard for hours.
5,Inspector Morse Does It Again!,"A very clever and entertaining book. As usual, Morse keeps us guessing until the very end...Colin Dexter is a true genius."
4,Morse at his best,Inspector Morse remains conflicted adding to the story line additional depth. Long live the Morse series only to be replaced by Inspector Lewis.
5,as always Dexter delivers with Morse,"As always, Dexter delivers with Inspector Morse. I appreciate these books more now that the Morse series ended. I love Morse himself and the crimes and how he solved them."
3,The Daughters of Who?,I am afraid that this book was not that interesting to me. I was disturbed by the fact that every one of these women were disturbed on some level. I felt so sorry for Ellie. I wished that she could have gotten her life together. I didn't think that all pieces of the puzzle fit together. The book confused me to the point that by the end I was not very interested in it.
3,Read and enjoy the writing and characters more than the plot,"Colin Dexter's 'Morse' series is an acquired taste, and to be honest, I think I've acquired more of a taste for his characters rather than the stories. The plot of this one didn't quite sustain itself through to the end, but the interaction of Morse, Lewis, and the rest of the inhabitants of Dexter's 'universe' are so well-written that the plots are almost secondary."
2,Too confusing,"This was my first bit of Dexter's work to read and I was somewhat disappointed. Some parts I just didn't get, even after rereading the section 2 or 3 times. For example, there was some dialogue about Kay's last name towards the end of the book, but it made no sense and didn't seem to have anything to do with the plot.I was also frustrated because the investigators summarized the logistics of the murder at the end, but I just could not follow the logic. Furthermore, the explanation was not backed up by evidence, it was just Morse's rambling.I prefer a more organized and evidence-supported explanation of the crime. In mysteries I like, I found myself wanting to reread the entire story to spot the clues as they unfold, but not in this case. Sorry Mr. Dexter."
5,An Indie Classic,"In short what a great album filled with short, chugging, catchy as hell rock songs that make you want to sing along with every listen. The muscianship is top notch and the singer, reminiscent of Greg Sage (Wipers) carries each track with finesse. Spoon mixes Pixie style rock riffs with interesting time signatures and catchy chorus to create an amazing mix of alternative rock that has been largely ignored by the public. This is Spoon's only release on Elektra and were dropped shortly after the release of this album which probably explains why this album went under most listener's radar. Comparisons to the Pixies is valid but these guys are in a league of their own. Buy this and discover your next favorite alternative rock CD."
3,i wish it were prettier,"it does sound like the pixies. tracks 6-8 arevery solid. it's nicely recorded--more ""indie""than the slicker later ones--it's on Merge so of courseit's a little unpolished (that is good). i have heard 2 otheralbums and liked the poppier stuff. got this used.get any of their stuff used. it's not the answer, asit were, to the kinks that everyone hopes for, but Spoonare good. wish it were prettier--like my favorite bandsXTC and The Black WAtch."
5,A Must-Have ReRelease.,"First off, this release also includes the two tracks from Spoon's ""Agony of LaFitte"" EP - LaFitte Don't Fail Me Now and the title track. Nice Bonus!A Series of Sneaks is an album that should not be absent in your collection. Featuring an uncharacteristicly ""clean"" production, the songs weave through the fabric of the indie rock sweater sewn by bands like Archers of Loaf, Sebadoh, Built to Spill, Guided by Voices etc.Highlights include: Execution, Car Radio and Metal Detektor. But there is really no ""filler"" on this album, every song can stand on its own.Great harmonies and dual guitar play abound. The drum sound is really tight too, making A Series of Sneaks an essential ""roll 'em down and drive"" CD. It'd be hard to spend a weekend with this CD and not sing along by Sunday afternoon.Turn off your local, sub-par radio station, dig the Spoon and enjoy yourself!"
1,"not worth it, looks great, questionable mechanics.","this watch looks like a million bucks but the chronometer function reset itself at the 45 position after a few weeks, which is disappointing. it's not rigid. i've had to have the band fixed three times as the pins have fallen out. for the price, it's definitely not worth it. looks-wise, it's worth $150. but the mechanics are timex quality. invicta is hit or miss. pray you get a good one and don't spend over a hundred bucks."
2,"Historical value, but poor image quality","It's very nice to go back to those exciting years with this DVD, but they could have done a better job with the image digitalization. There is much better image quality bootleg DVD's out there with virtually the same content. I think fans deserve the best for the money they spend and unfortunately, this is not the case."
5,Historic,This is a must have DVD even if you are not a Beatles fan so to speak. It's a historic document of a special time in history when The Beatles were introduced to America in their prime. A must see.
3,"Good Beatles Reference, Good History Too","I got this because the name Julia Meade, a frequent Ed Sullivan Show commercial spokesperson, was on the Amazon page for this. I've been researching her for a project, But it turns out she is not in this collection (I have heard she was on the show for the Rolling Stones performance).That said, I am a big Beatles fan, and this DVD is really a great piece of history...not just for the details on them, but for seeing all of the other folk on these four shows...from Cab Calloway to acrobats. A great time capsule."
3,Less than stellar remastering,"It was great to sit back and see this dvd as I was around when these shows originaly aired.The first thing I have to warn everyone is that the 5.1 track is horrid but the mono track is excellent.Talk about looking through a window into mid 60's america I stand corrected, ""white"" america as no blacks could be seen in the audience save for the Florida show where Sonny Liston and Joe Louis were introduced and take a bow.It is amazing to see how different the Beatles appearance was compared to the manner of style the audience had.I would highly recommend this dvd to all Beatle fans and anyone else who wants a nostalgic peek to back in the day but don't expect too much from the black and white video or the audio."
2,Ed Sullivan,"I thought there would be more artist performing and did not realize there would be so much black and white television. It was fun watching the old commercials, though. Overall, it was okay."
1,Just Terrible,"This DVD contains Ed Sullivan show in their entirety. I must say, I thought that the commercials were the most interesting. The first Beatles set was fun to watch, but it was boring afterwards. Te rest of Ed's show was just terrible and I mean terrible and grating. Please, I wasted my money on this, I don't want to see anyone else do the same"
1,ALMOST A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"with the exception of the Beatles' performance's this dvd set was a almost a total waste of money for me. ididn't know i was getting FOUR HOURS of complete ed sullivan shows. i don't know what was worse, the insufferable acts on his show or the commercials they play throughout. i ended up fast forwarding through everything except the beatles acts. i think they could have done this dvd a lot better and in my opinion, just buy a picture of the beatles back then and a good cd you like of them instead of this dvd set cuz it's a waste of money."
4,fascinating historical document,"it's interesting to see the beatles within the context of their contemporaries in the entertainment world of 1964. i wasn't born at the time so it is something of a revelation to me. some of the other acts on the show are embarrassingly bad, but this was the state of the still infantile tv of the time. the beatles ushered in a period of unbridled creativity that was only hinted at during this period. the video quality is poor much of the time when compared to the same clips as presented in the beatles anthology series. ed himself seems to have all the charisma and savy of a stuffed hippo, but he certainly managed to pull in some of the finest musical acts of the sixties over the course of his run. he was mtv, vh1, and soul train all rolled into one. ed gave america the beatles and we shouldn't forget him for that."
2,Something only a Beatles fan would enjoy,"I purchased this set expressly for the segment featuring Gordon and Sheila MacRae's take-off on ""The Garry Moore Show,"" which I found to be silly and not nearly as good as I had read about in my research. Also, not being a Beatles fan, I found the ""fab fours'"" segments to be noisy and uninteresting as well; however, I enjoyed a few of the other performances given by guest stars such as Mitzi Gaynor and Cab Calloway in this four episode grouping."
4,"Neat set, but could have been better","I bought this set a year ago when it first came out. Amazon has a great price. I paid almost twice as much. It's a must have for a any Beatles fan. But, the set isn't exactly as advertised. It claims to have all four shows in full-length format with all the original commercials intact. All the cigarette commercials were left out and few seconds here and there of the show itself were omitted, as well. The menu is also flawed. But, what the heck, we bought the set for one reason only and that's to see the Fabs!!"
5,The way such shows were MEANT to be seen,"Thanks to Sofa/GoodTimes for doing up this set the right way. So many variety shows presented us with great entertainment during the golden era of television. Yet, I know of very few which are available in their entirety on DVD!The majority of nods to this genre are done in a ""Best Of"" edited format. This is not the way the shows were meant to be seen, and certainly not the way I want to watch them. (This carries over to numerous genres, as well. I don't want a DVD of World Series highlights. I want the whole games!)Sofa/GoodTimes has maintained these four shows intact, including both the good and the bad acts....and even including the commercials!!! They should be congratulated for the former and applauded for the latter.The video varies in quality. But one must remember that these shows weren't preserved in the same manner as ""I Love Lucy"", and thus, can't be expected to be pristine.Now if only someone would issue full episodes of ""The Hollywood Palace""!"
5,"Like others in the series, Van Richten never fails to impress.","Great source material for any setting with a few tweeks Well written and full of imagination, a hallmark of the series."
4,on the go,"This stroller although out-of-stock and out-dated, I was happy to have found it still circulating because I currently have the carseat that goes with it. Its very good to have because of its different compartments. The only down fall is that it is bulky and heavy. Without a car to store the stroller in the trunk, its not good to use on the bus. However, it does what it supposed to do, stroll the child."
5,Masterfully composed,"This mesmerizing soundscape masterfully composed by Mark Lineberry, underscores & enhances the very heart of J. Reuben Silverbird's mystical vision. Thanks to Mark's most graceful weaving of Reubens poetic narration with the sounds of nature gently riding on the air of Perry Silverbird's magical flute, you will find yourself transported back in time, looking through the eyes of a native american.I was greatly disappointed that Mr. Silverbird did not give proper credit where credit was due, as Mark did most of the production on ""The World in Our Eyes"".I bow deeply to Mark who has gone on to greater realms, most likely spreading beautiful harmonies wherever he ventures. This World misses him greatly."
5,1/3 the cost of other places,"Our 1990 Volvo pump was dying - my wife knows where to lean out and hit under the car (if its not starting) to get the dying pump spinning. So got this, installed and works as expected. And it was also good to install an OEM part - out with the old, in with the new: Wires and filter and hoses fit."
4,Playing the Alien,"Dragonstar is a science fantasy setting that is more sci-fi than fantasy. While it can be considered a critter book in some respects, every critter in here is intended to be made available to PCs. Many of the monsters here are their own creations revamped for hard core sci-fi that is tweaked with a touch of magic. Ever wanted to play a futuristic blob that can think for itself? Get this book. Ever wanted to play the futuristic version of a skeleton warrior? Again you want this book. A lot of interesting races are available in here. Players will find new challenges and options for their characters. GMs will find great potential for new and interesting NPCs to spring on their unsuspecting players. If you've just gotten into Dragonstar or are just looking for something new and weird to infect your campaign, consider this book. For all the options it gives, it's worth the price."
2,Sound is unforgivable!,"First of all, let me say that I have been a student of Joe Morello for the last eight years and that the material in this DVD, which I already have on VHS is beautiful and extremely informative. Joe covers all aspects of drumming on the drum set and gets to the point unlike other recently heralded ""gurus"" of the drums.HOWEVER, I would advise anybody to buy the VHS tape of this for several reasons. Firstly, the extras are just bogus. The excercises are isolated and you can slow them down which in my opinion is poorly done. Most importantly, the sound is for the most part distorted and there are several points where the sound actually cuts out. It seems to me as if this is the work of irresponsible, lazy technicians who transferred this to DVD who clearly were not listening to what they were doing. Obviously, this is an attempt on the part of Hot Licks to make more money for doing nothing to this DVD. In fact, they made it WORSE."
5,Go West,"These poems describe an internal landscape as lonesome and unknowable, and yet as inescapably beautiful, as the Wyoming in which they are (mostly) set. Camp a few days alone in the wilderness of the Rockies -- where the rest of the world can seem simply not matter, but where a brutal nature will not let the world be ignored --and you'll know what I mean. Read ""Three Sonnets"" or ""Everyone Knows Whom the Saved Envy"" and you are in that wilderness."
1,WRONG DESCRIPTION,Item is described as laser tag set and is NOT!! No wonder there is no picture. This seems like fraud to me.
5,Classic,"The CD has some of McGraw's classic tunes and is a real fun listener. My only complaint would be its opening track, Indian Outlaw, which I consider annoying and almost scared me from the rest of the CD."
3,Not his greatest,"This is a fairly good CD, except he didn't put Refried Dreams or Not a Moment Too Soon on it. Instead he put his 2 sappiest songs, Please Remember Me and My Best Friend, which are pop songs basically. He left off his hardcore country songs, which are his best."
4,very good compilation,"This album isn't as thorough as it could be. There are many key tracks missing that were also hits. ""Everywhere"", ""Can't Be Really Gone"", ""One of These Days"", ""Not a Moment Too Soon"", ""Some Things Never Change"", and ""Refried Dreams"" are all missing. Having said that, the 15 tracks that are present serve as a very good introduction to those who aren't familiar with Tim McGraw's music. I question putting ""Let's Make Love"" on there since that is more of a Faith Hill song and appears on her album ""Breathe"". The cd is just over 55 minutes so all those other tracks I mentioned could have been added. But I do like the album nonetheless and although there are no new tracks, it's a great collection for those who want most of McGraw's music on one collection. This is Tim McGraw's first greatest hits compilation and at the rate his songs climb the charts, I don't think this will be his last."
5,Tim McGraw's Greatest Hits,"Tim McGraw's Greatest Hits cd is a must have for your cd collection. You will never get tired of listening to these country hits over and over again. Beginning with the controversial, yet career starting hit, ""Indian Outlaw,"" this cd is full of wonderful songs that will make you want to join in and sing along. He follows up the first song with other great songs like, ""Don't Take the Girl,"" ""I Like it I Love it,"" and ""Down on the Farm.""It has been four years since this cd came out and I still keep it in my cd player at home. I think it is about time for a new greatest hits cd to come out for Tim McGraw. There needs to be a cd with the current hits, such as ""Real Good Man"", ""Red Ragtop"", and ""Live Like You Were Dying"", along with the older songs that were overlooked on the first album."
5,Oustanding!!,I would recommend this CD to everyone. Well worth the money. Not once do I touch the 'skip' button.
5,Best Compilation Ever,"Tim McGraw is by far one of the most touching artists in the country music genre. Coupled with his wife, Faith Hill, he has marched steadily over the years to gain supreme dominance in the country music world. This compilation brings together everybody's favorite McGraw Hits and throws them into one CD. While it is a shame that Everywhere is not on the CD, the most important song of McGraw's career, Don't Take the Girl, is included and placed near the front of the CD, where greatness belongs. I already had the CD's but decided to by the compilation just so I'd have all my favorites on one CD. Great Job...if you do not have it, buy it today."
2,Why Bother With It?,"As a fan of Mcgraw's music since his second album, myself and many of his fans already have his CD's and tapes in our collection. That brings me to this question... IF many of his fans already have his music and there is no new material (i.e. live cuts, remixes, etc) then there is no need to shell out an additional $15 or so on the album. Come on Tim, you're getting Garth syndrome and getting gready, just in time for the holidays. Save your money folks and save it for new material."
5,Tim is the Greatest!,"I'm not exactly the typical country fan. My musical tastes tend to lean more toward alternative music, but when a friend of mine introduced me to the ""Everywhere"" cd, I was blown away. Since then, I can't seem to get enough of Tim. I rushed out to get this cd the day it came out and it did not disappoint. I love all the songs on there, I only wish there were more of them. It would have been nice to have ""Refried Dreams"", ""Everywhere"" and ""One of These Days""(which is a beautiful song), on the cd as well. Other than those omissions, the cd does a great job of chronicling many of Tim's biggest and best songs since the beginning of his career. From the gotta-sing-along-to ""I Like It, I Love It"" to the bittersweet ""Just To See You Smile"" to the reflective ""My Next Thirty Years"", this cd is song after song of good music."
1,damaged product,"When I received the cd, it was severely scratched. The first song played and I was very happy until the second song started and skipped threw the whole song, so I skipped it to track four and it was scratched there as well. I ended up throwing the cd away."
1,Yeeeeeeeeee Haww,Don't fuget to smack da wife and leave a bag o' grain for yer 13 kids ta eat bufor ya go to da Mcgraw concert.
4,Great Sounds,"As always Tim McGraw is just the best. I really like this CD, but I am very partial to really lively country music. Nonetheless, I plan to buy more of Tim.Thanks."
3,NOT THE BEST ONE FOR ME...,"someone told me that Tim McGraw was the best in country music... i bought this cd because i heard some of his songs at a line dance club, and i didnt like this cd that much i only loved the songs ""just to see you smile"" and ""it's your love"" man i loved them! but that's about it"
5,Awesome,"This CD is good. I'm very glad that he came out with a Greatest Hits CD, so I didn't have to go buy five different albums just to hear my favorite songs. The songs on this CD are truly his best."
2,NEC P5200 Pinwriter Printer Ribbon,"The ordering and shipping processes were excellent and effortless. The cartridge arrived ahead of its projected arrival date and was exactly what I ordered. It arrived wrapped and sealed in its original packaging. The ribbon ink, however, was dry... rendering the cartridge useless."
1,Very Elementary,"If you want to see what every tourist sees (or less)-- this is for you. Nothing exciting and very dull and boring......I'm sorry I bought the thing.....goodbye $10, I'll miss you!"
2,Not compatible,"Ehh, it looked good on paper and the sound is fine when I actually got it to work with television. Since that wasn't my purpose, I'm a bit disappointed. I guess that makes me the bad shopper."
1,Not 5.1 ch,"I bought this product looking for a cheap 5.1 it is just a glorified stereo. It sounds good that's not the issue the issue is it is not true 5.1 just a heads up to the next poor sap that thinks he is getting a great deal, but if 2 ch stereo is all you are looking for it a great system for the price bass sounds good"
5,Superb beyond words.,This CD takes you on an exquisite journey into yourself... A master with overtones and chants... A unique blend of Tibetan sounds and Sacred Chants... awesome.
5,Fun and interesting Recipes,Fun and interesting cookbook.. full of surprising information. A fantastic look at cooking over a hundred years ago. Need 'recipes for the sick'? Got it. Ever wondered about a Zephyrette? You now have a recipe. A definite must have for any cookbook collection.
2,Good looking but LOUD beeping unacceptable!,"It seems to be a well made toaster & convection oven -- quite a step up from my previous DeLonghi toaster oven. Unfortunately, the beeping of the digital console is WAY TOO LOUD and requires WAY TOO MANY beeps to do anything. For example, to do 2 slices of toast, it requires more than 7 button beeps to do that (and that's without pre-heating so the toast won't be done right anyway). These beeps are much louder and ""cheaper"" sounding than my oven and microwave and my dog runs out of the house every time I tried using it.I contact DeLonghi Customer Support. The beeping cannot be turned off and the volume cannot be turned down. Also, the presets (e.g. 4 slices of toast at level 4) cannot be changed.I don't understand why DeLonghi does not improve the software in these devices. I'm sending mine back..."
3,shrilling beeping!,"Take the other reviewers complaints of loud beeping seriously. I did not and will be returning this for the newer model. Bear in mind that I am very tolerant of noises with all of my toddler's electronic toys but this beeping is different. It is very high pitched. Personally, I don't like to wake up to that.It's a dealbreaker for me. I found the newer model at Costco for $110."
4,DeLonghi DO1279 6 6-Slice Toaster Oven,"This item replaces an older model of a DeLonghi oven. The new oven is very attractive and easy to operate. The beep signal audio is way down from the older model but otherwise it is an excellent addition to my kitchen. All newer toaster ovens are designed deeper to accommodate food items up to 12 inches. The temperature control begins with 180 degs. for ""keep warm,"" followed by preset temps at 200, and up to 450 at 25 degree increments. I also like the oven light when the unit is operating."
3,not as good as older model,"I purchased this to upgrade the Delonghi I already have. It looks better sitting on the counter but it has a long way to go to be better than the other one. It has less wattage,it is only timed for 30 minutes instead of 60 minutes. It makes banging noises when it is running and I have to turn the temperature higher and wait longer for things to cook. Pretty is not always best."
1,"Good looking, but uneven toasting","This toaster oven is a smart looking items with easy to read controls and even a few slide out menus to remind you how to work the buttons. However, I found that it did not toast bread evenly. One side was always over done while the other side was under done. Tried different positions and settings, but nothing worked."
2,Liked it but malfunctioned after a couple of weeks,"I got this toaster oven as a gift. We liked it at first (the beeping signaling your toast is done is very loud and annoying) but within a few uses, the ""mode"" writing on the toast button, came off. After another week, the display starting shorting out on a daily basis. I called DeLonghi's thinking I could exchange it since we got it a month ago. They were nice but said I would have to take it to a service center to get it fixed or ship it to one. I would have to wait for them to fix it (no charge other than potential shipping) and then be out of a toaster oven while they fixed it. It just didn't ring good customer service since it's practically brand new. I would recommend buying an oven from a company that at least has a decent exchange/warranty and won't fall apart after just a few uses."
3,Great for baking,"Pros:1. Great for baking pizzas (which came out in perfect balance of crispness and softness), oven dishes and cakes (I've baked lasagnas and butter loaf cakes so far with great success)2. It has a convenient interior light3. The outside surface doesn't get too hot4. It doesn't have a metal trim on the glass door that gets hot enough to burn (Many of the Cuisinart ovens in the similar price range seem to have this issue)5. Simple/easy to operateCons:1. It does only an OK job of toasting (takes approx. 5 minutes to toast and the resulting bread is a little dried out).2. It gives an annoying loud beep when I change some of the settings, and the continuous version (3 beeps) when it's ready.Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with the purchase as I bake a lot, but at the same time, I'm considering to buy a separate toaster..."
1,Uneven cooking,I was dissapointed in this DeLonghi product since most are decent performers. Uneven cooking and extra-long cooking times are the machines downfall. I replaced a 10 year old Krups that was still working better than this was new. I suggest Krups or Cuisinart.
1,HANDLE CAME OFF,"I like the toaster but you have to work with it to get the toast just right. After just a little more than a year the handle came loose on one side. Called DeLonghi and I am out of luck because it is out of warranty and no one will talk to me on how to get to the screw to tightened it back up, it is behind the glass. Hey for a $130.00 toaster oven it should be an easy fix not something that takes an expert to get to a screw to fix it, nor something a person should have to send it in to get fixed. Not happy with this purchase!!!"
5,Transforming Music,"In the mid 1980's, I was seeking to align my outward life with my inner most desires and longings. My wife and I were reconstructing our marriage based upon truthful living and sharing. Some nights we would listen to the radio program Hearts of Space. This program presented alternative comtempletive music, mostly electronic but sometimes we would hear a magical transforming work. In 1986, we heard Seekers of the Truth. It spoke to both of us, and literally played a part in our healing process. Even to this day, this CD is a most treasured part of our music collection."
3,Don't use on 2009 or newer cars with TPMS,These are well made since they're created out of plastic with brass threads inside. The only problem will be if used on newer cars having Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems. If your valve stems are made of aluminum they will not like brass because the stem is basically an electrified antenna. These will weld themselves by galvanic action once driven on salty roads (an electrochemical process in which one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact and immersed in an electrolyte). I almost destroyed one valve stem getting the cap off. Just one TPMS valve runs about $55 plus tire removal and balancing - $100 potential loss per a tire. Other than that they are great and look nice.
4,"Great book, especially considering it was for a college course","The book was very entertaining. I'm sure that some out there who are hard and fast attached to the classic versions of Greek mythology would feel at odds with Renault's rendition of the classic Theseus tale, but this is a quality read and a very interesting look into what life in the bronze age may have been like. Renault incorporates many aspects of the Minoan/Mycenean culture that should allow even readers familiar with the historical documentation of the period to encounter new images and expanded cultural possibilities. I was very pleased with the read, and the delivery of the product was timely and as promised."
4,Easy way to learn about Greek Mythology,A great novel to learn about Greek mythology without having to memorize so many names and places all at once.
4,Ancient Greek myth revisited,A classic retelling of the classic myth of Theseus. Compelling and will inspire a love of all things Greek!
5,One of my favorite books.,"All people who review this book should first declare their age. (32) Simply put, this is perhaps my favorite book. Beyond words really. I recommend it to anyone with an IQ over 120."
4,"An enjoyable read, absorbing and full of suspence.","I had to read this book for my summer reading before entering my new school, and I found that it was one of the best books I have ever had to read for any school. The characters are well developed, and they have the true characteristics of real people. When characters don't develope, I find myself unsatisfied and dissapointed. I was drawn into the book, and the details fascinated me. I was, however, confused at times as to what was being explained. When Theseus finds Ariandne in the cart after the festival at Naxos, I don't understand quite what happened. But I have been distracted recently, so I might not have been paying attention. I am going to go back and re-read the whole book again, to make sure I can grasp all the details, and just to reunite myself with the characters. This book has motivated me to study Greek history and mythology. I recommend this book to those who enjoy ancient history, and who are interseted in Greek mythology."
2,Too much testosterone,"I love mythology and history, and after reading the reviews I had high hopes. I could not finish this book. Theseus is portrayed as an oversexed macho twerp. I could not finish because at a certain point I just didn't care what happened to him. I think a teenage boy would love this book, but it's not for me."
2,"A modernized ""Cliff Notes"" version of the ancient tale","The author's work came up frequently by amazon.com's recommendation service, as historical fiction is my favorite entertainment-reading genre. But I must say that despite all of the positive reviews of this work, I was quite disappointed. I only managed to finish it the second time I picked-up the book. Now that I have, I was left with a sense of being letdown. I got no sense of the Achaian, Minyan, or Cretan cultures, nor did I feel anything for any of the characters. I almost felt as though I was reading a modernized ""Cliff Notes"" version of the ancient tale. While the modernization of the story of Theseus seemed quite plausible, this was the only real innovation of this book."
2,this book was VERY hard to follow!,"this book was very confusing for me,i had to do a report on it and i was so lost. ....thanx!"
1,"Bought NEW PAPERBACK novel, and received an OLD USED HARDCOVER novel!!!!!!!!!!!","Dear International Books Return Department,I just wanted to let you know how disappointed I am in this company. I bought this book via amazon and bought the NEW PAPERBACK book, and what do I receive? An old book that is a hardcover and also ITS USED WITH UNDERLINES IN THE BOOK! There are underline markings on pages 336-337 and the pages are all brown as if the book has been made years ago. This book is considered old and used. I bought a new paper back, and I receive a hardcover used old book with markings in them. I have been waiting for this book for about a week and I was very disappointed. Anyone who sees this book knows its old and I am not to take advantage of. Please put this book in the old section and not new, as anyone can tell that this book is very old with the aged brown pages with underlines in them, so it means someone has used it. Very insulted!!!!!!"
1,another one bites the dust,"One after another the great myths fall to a writer who tries to melodramatize, and tune them up. In this story the great tale of Theseus is butchered. I really can not see how such a great story can be shreded to nonsense. Honestly, LEAVE ALL THE CLASSICS ALONE. You will NEVER be able to make them any beter than they already are. With that said now I will move onto the actual book. Bad writing PERIOD. The writing is a stab at being origional, but it is way too choppy. And at some times this book actually became boring. As the book went on, the boerdom streaks became more common. WOW, HOW DOES ONE MAKE A GREAT TALE BORING,.....MAGIC.By the way, if you disagree with me, then you are wrong."
3,The King Must Die by Mary Renault,"This book, captures a period of time that little is known about. It brings ancient Greece, and acncient civilization to life. But besides the historical aspect, you see the core of man. Theseus, is proud and it is his pride that drives him through everything, it keeps him going. Things along the way help him, leadership, talent but throughout his long journey it is his pride that is his endless supply of fuel."
3,Lost in the Maze,"I've long been an admirer of Ms. Renault. I've read pretty much everything she's written. I'm accustomed to being sucked into the story from the very first pages, and to come away at the end with something I didn't have at the beginning, be it understanding, compassion or a better developed historical sense. This book actually disappointed me. I kind of forced myself to finish it, hoping for the magical moment when I BECAME the book. It never happened. Although most of the characters are fairly three-dimensional, the story lags and finally edges toward the fantasitical usually associated with Anne McCaffery. Still, Ms. Renault at her less-than-best is much, much better than most."
3,Not what I expected,"I read this book because it was required reading for my class. The story was interesting and descriptive, but often confusing. I would recommend this book to those interested ancient Greek legends, with a large vocabulary, and to those no younger than high school age. Although this was an interesting tale, I think it was a little to advanced for those in early high school."
3,Review of Renault's 'The King Must Die',"Renault offers a slow, pensive biography of Theseus. I won't deny there are some stirring moments in this novel, but I insist that it is too reflective to get any real rises out of its reader. Moreover, I'm not sure that this thoughtful novel really has much to say. There are no strong centers of consideration in this work--no themes of the reader to latch on to. Overall, 'King' was a careful, sleepy retelling of the life of Theseus."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mary Renault's the King Must Die is a novel about Theseus. She tries to turn the story into something that could theoretically have happened, or almost, anyway.So rather than fighting monsters, as a young man Theseus was a bull dancer, one of a trouple that did crazy stunts in a public arena involving acrobatics and large bovines.The book is not completely devoid of fantasy though."
5,if you love ancient mythology...,"This is book was my introduction into the genius of Mary Renault. I am now an avid seeker of all her books. The depth of her knowledge of historical facts, paired with her knowledge of ancient mythology, lays a great foundation for this story. But her secret to excellence is her rich storytelling -- closer to a translation of Homer than modern prose. It lends a sense of mystery and intrigue that keeps you thirsty for more. Theseus, and Bronze Age Greece, springs to life."
5,Rogue States Rocks!,"These colors don't run!In addition to Real War, Rogue States is definetly an upgrade!<"
4,Good for all levels of knitting & crocheting experience,"I bought this book because of my love for Lion Brand yarns, especially ""Wool Ease Thick & Quick"". I was pleased to find patterns for both knitting AND crocheting. I have tried several of the patterns and found them to be easy to understand and easy to match the gauge because the yarn is something I can actually find and afford instead of the expensive designer yarns that most books use. I did find one mistake in the book, though, and I wanted to share it because other than the one typo the pattern is FABULOUS! On the pattern called Braided Branches the instructions for the Increase Row reads: knit 3, place marker, knit 3, [knit 1, make 1] 6 times. You should OMIT the second ""knit 3"" in the pattern. Hope this helps!"
2,Better to Save your Money,"I never tire of knitting accessories, especially scarves, even after knitting for many years. That is why I was intrigued by this book. Lion Brand Yarns has expanded their lines in recent years to include nearly every kind of furry, fuzzy, and bulky concoction one could ever think of. While I think these designs can be funky and fun, the book offers very little in terms of classic styles that will last the test of time.Many other scarf/accessory books have come out in the past few months--offering prettier and more classic styles. Check some of these out before jumping in and purchasing this one."
5,Another great book....,"I have recently started knitting and this was my 2nd knitting book purchase. Lion Brand yarn has won me over and I did not even notice this was a book by them... The nice thing about this book is that it provides patterns for the very beginner to the very advanced; I like this because it is a book I will be able to refer back to when I become 'advanced'! The pictures are great and they give you a good idea on how the pattern will turn out. The patterns included in the book do not seem too hard to follow either. I have already finished one out of the book and I am eager to start more.Another great thing about this book, is how they will provide the same pattern for individuals who knit and crochet. This is great because many knitters like to learn how to crochet, and visa versa, so it is a book that will be on someone's shelf for awhile-- and mine will be one of them!"
2,More towards knitting,"I bought this book but I did not really read carefully, this book has knitting, and more knit than crochet and the crocheted scarve are nothing worth looking at, yarn they use not as nice as the knit. More to beginner crocheters.. They could of been better"
5,just for scarves,just for scarves is a great book and best price i will always order my books for amazon. you no if you cant it in the stores you can always go to amazon.com
5,Vast is different and finally something new,"I heard the song ""Touch"" on my local radio station 107.7 the End and I had to go buy the record. And when I played it I was suprised and shocked at how different and beautifully haunting the music was. Track number 5 with the monk sample, orchestra, and guitars is so refreashing. I throughly enjoy Vast and I recomend it to anyone in out there looking for something new and different who are tired of the same old thing."
5,An awesome listening experience!,Run to your local music store and buy this CD at once!! I promise you've never heard anything like it. VAST rules!!!
5,I fell in love with this CD,"The beautiful lyrics and music of this CD make it one of the most impressive, entertaining, and amazing thing I've ever owned. The talents of Jon Crosby are shown so well in this CD. With his incrediable range in music and beautiful, yet also hard voice, i've been listening to this CD very very often for the past 2 years. This CD has a great mix of rock with classical and intrumental music. JON CROSBY IS A TRUE ROCK STAR!!! It is a must to buy it! YOU MUST BY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, make sure to check the band out in concert. I saw them in NJ and it was an amazing show. ...."
5,Outstanding. Music for Everyone!,"This was just about the best album I'd ever bought. I was even taken by suprise by enjoying orchestra sounds. It has great beats. Brilliant and groovy guitars. Amazing atmospherics that seem to wrap u up in a small ball and take u in and most of all, every lyric this guy, Jon Crosby, comes out with I can relate to almost as if I'd been through the same situation.It is complete genious! Although I'd should warn you it can get depressing if you take in the music."
4,That's some good eatin',"VAST is like nothing else I've ever heard. His hard rockin' vocals and guitar meld awesomely with the chanting. I don't think it'll go down as the best CD I've ever heard, but if you enjoyed Pretty When you Cry and/OR Touched, I highly recommend this album. There's plenty of variety in the songs to keep you comin' back."
5,Excellent music,"I first heard this album in my brothers' car and as soon as I could I ""borrowed"" it and listened to it over and over. I loved it from the first moment I heard it. There is a hard driving force, rhythm and harmony behind this music that makes it wonderful to hear on several levels. Though some parts are a little repetitive, the way all of the melodies and rythyms come together around or play off of a single tune or background chant makes it more interesting. A novel notion - I'd like techno if it was a little more dynamic. VAST is a little like what techno would be if it were more music and less noise. -And it's very good."
1,Sampling????,"I found out about this musician (VAST) from the soundtrack of ""Step Into Liquid"". I instantly recognized the vocals on the song ""Touched"" as those of Le Mystere de Voix Bulgares. The song being sampled is ""Polegnala E Pschenitza"". The CD is also named Le Mystere de Voix Bulgares. The entire collection is really beautiful. I saw them live in Brooklyn in '94 and was deeply moved by it.I don't think that VAST's sampling of Le Mystere's vocals generates an entirely original song even given it's ""rock"" context."
5,"I Love This,","I love this..Acoustic (reminds me of gazing at Bahai Temple in Wilmette while driving by with ""Touched"" song on..) guitars (and sexy sensual songs that speak of free-spirited human beings) mixed with samples and synth and (sexy)electric guitar..Sarolta DeFaltay wrote an article about Druids and Celts in ""Spiritual Bathing"" book, and it seems to go with the Muzzin cries (or Is it celt?) that emanate on this album, every song is synth and Depeche Mode like, mixed with Cat Stevens style guitar and Goth low vocals, love to this man, I met him, sexy, caring about fans, love, my (and go read Sarolta's contribution in that book..) man..Vanes"
5,Incomparable,"After listening to Vast for all these years, I still have a hard time defining what it sounds like. Ambient, dark, and beautiful might help to summarize the gorgeous album. Reminds me a little of NIN or Stabbing Westward."
4,"All the right influences blended for unique, familiar sound!","The one man band of Vast (aka Jon Crosby) hits with a blast right from the inital track ""Here"". His powerful voice mixed with the dark lyrics and thundering guitars and drums brings forth images of Alice In Chains blended with Pink Floyd and the darkness of classic goth and industrial. At times the tracks may seem a little too formulated but the constant injection of worldly influences keeps it interesting. Definite highlights are ""Here"", ""Dirty Hole"", ""Pretty When You Cry"" and the haunting closing track ""You""."
3,Fabulous in parts....,"Well I don't think I would get all hyperbolic over this CD (but then again I haven't seen the film clips). However ""Touched"" and ""Pretty when you cry"" are definately worth the price of the cd. ""Pretty when you cry"" is all the stuffed up relationships or non relationships you have ever had. Either he has a good imagination or he is a seriously sick 21 year old....And so what if he samples the same sounds twice?"
3,odd,"An interesting cross of gothic and techno technologies. Though VAST starts out with the basics, a heavy drum beat, even an intersting comment, it begins to unravel near the discs middle. songs such as I'm Dying take that chant thing a bit too far. Somewhere Else To Be is old and monotonous, becoming irritating before the first listening has ended. Then, of course, there's the whistling harshness of Three Doors, wirth it's annoyingly cliched lyrics yelled too loud over the same techno beats that have been used by the industries shames for years. I mean, don't get me wrong, there are good songs. Pretty when you cry is sick enough to entertain and flames is almost humbling with it's played romantic violin, even the coustic feel of Touched is is nice at times, but overall, this is only a decent album. if you've got money that u need to get rid of, then perhaps u should give this a listen, but otherwise save it for the new Nails Album."
2,Not that good,"Vast really isn't that good. The lyrics are the worst I've heard in recent memory and the samples and chanting are just plain gimmicky. Crosby comes off as a Trent Reznor wannabe who falls pathetically short. However, the music is somewhat decent, so I give it two stars."
5,My audition for VAST...,"Back in August 98 I auditionned for VAST, as a guitar player. I remember listening to the demo tape on the bus, trying to remember the songs forms...Since then I've seen them live...Amazing. Jon C has an incredible voice, the songs are beautiful. The mix of modern samples and grooves, agressive rock..just buy it, I don't have the words...and go see them live!"
5,breathe taking,"a friend of mine had just gotten the cd, and i'd just come out of a bad relationship, and he read my the lyrics to "" pretty when you cry"" and i was in shoke that someone else could felt that way. the music has saved my sanity, Jon Crosby is a geneus. He writes with feeling, weather it be real or amagined."
4,An excellent disc by a promising artist.,"VAST's music conjures up images not of suffering or pain, or of people forsaken, but informed spiritual doubt, sexual uncertainty and a world in flux as it approaches a fever pitch of Millennium prophets, greedy daytraders, out-of-control teenagers and the ""lost"" generation of which Jon Crosby is a part. I myself come from that same generation, and I find VAST to be a very good soundtrack to my day to day life. In a confusing world, it's good to know that someone else feels the same way you do - and Crosby's voice is passionate and outspoken; he's someone you'd like to have as a friend, if only because you feel you can trust him."
5,"Haunting, chilling, addicting","I purchased this CD to review for the high school paper. Like others, I had heard ""Touched"" on the radio. I did not expect this CD to enchant me, lyrics running through my head, and beats in my body. ""You,"" ""Flames"" and ""Temptation"" are highlights for me. There is no other music like this."
5,Sign me up to receive every cd ever put out by Jon Crosby.,"This album is unbelievable, This guy has been acclaimed for his talent before, (sited as a incredible talent at age 13 by guitar magazine) Talent isn't everything, the radio is filled with talented people who are around to make money, and their crap gets old. Jon Crosby seems to have writen this album with amazing passion, amazing. And thats what makes this album so great, it is so different, so filled with talent and passion, there is nothing else out there like it. The lyrics are genius."
5,"IF THIS ISN'T GREAT MUSIC, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!","VAST does the greatest music I have ever heard. It hits you on so many levels. It is unique and powerful. It is so different from anything else out there, and that's what makes it so great. Jon Crosby is brilliant. His lyrics alone can move you but when you add the beautiful music that no one else can even compare to, you get totally blown away! My only regret is not knowing about this amazing band before. If I had to describe VAST in one word-Perfect!!! VAST RULES!!!"
5,truly vast,"This is one of the best, most musically perfect albums I own. Every time I listen to it the songs take a new meaning and I hear more depth in the music, and I am struck by how truly beautiful every note they play is.Congratulations, Mr. Jon Crosby, and everyone else who had a hand in the making of this album. You have created a work that is nearly impossible not to love. Thank you."
2,Potential Lost,"This book has the makings of a brilliant WWII techno-thriller with personable characters and a fairly well thought out plot. Sadly the story loses momentum and the characters take on a very stylized formula which muddles the plot and becomes preditcable. It doesn't seem like the author did much research before undertaking this work, either on biological warfare or Nazi Germany. It is interesting reading, but had much more potential."
3,Mildly fun but not a historical novel by any means.,"A Third Reich fantasy--not even remotely a historical novel. While I love a good yarn, and ones that bend (or even change) history a bit are fun light reading; but they must at least be set in the basic factual frame. This book, while indeed a fun light read (I usually read factual history), is set in a totally unrecognizable Nazi Germany, in description, characters, places, geography, etc. I couldn't find even a vague representation of anything historically factual. One can learn things from good historical fiction, but there is nothing like that here.Other than that, the story is fairly predictable and the characters rather pat, but the book is well written and flows nicely. The bittersweet sort of regretful love interest is one of the better ones found in a thriller I thought."
2,Easily damaged by water,"Easy to hold. Brushes well.The instructions say to ""Wash before initial use. Wash in warm water using mild liquid soap."" When I did that, the brush absorbed water through the bristle holes, became waterstained, and cracked.The bristle holes are evidently not sealed during manufacture (should be done before or while the bristles are being glued in).Amazon sent a replacement. The replacement had the same problem."
2,"Great brush, but DEFECTIVE","The brush is adorable and the boar's hair is soft and perfect for a baby's fine hair. The only downside is the quality. When I received it, I washed the bristles in luke warm water and mild soap and dried it, bristle side down, overnight. The next day, I found the wood warped and cracked in two places. I had to return it and didn't bother to exchange it because I figured they would all do that. I read in another person's review that this had happened to theirs too but figured that it was just that particular brush or that they didn't follow the washing instructions properly, but it's actually the brush itself. If I don't find another brand that I like just as much as this one, I'll buy another and try again."
5,Beautiful set,"This is a wonderful wooden brush/comb set. Besides being an attactive set, it also works very well. The bristles are soft. Our munchkin was born with ALOT of hair and has enjoyed having his head brushed since the beginning. Highly recommend this set."
1,Cracked Wood,"I purchased this brush based on the good reviews that had been posted previously. I followed the Care instructions ""Wash before initial use. Wash in warm water using mild liquid soap. Rinse thoroughly with clear water. Air dry"". The wood cracked within an hour and the bristles absorbed the soap!"
5,Much more than Sade here ...,"Revise here, in a few pages, your notion of the Marquis de Sade. Paz's growing comprehension of the depth of Sade's formulation of what is and is not ""erotic"" - Paz's 1947 poem, his 1960 essay on Sade's ""ideas,"" and his 1986 essay that completes this progression of understanding - is only one joy in this slim volume. Paz's recollection of his conversation with Jean Paulhan at the Parc Montsouris, capturing the feel of Paris and that time, is worth the price of admission."
5,Solid Performer,"I had the use of my buddy's charger for years and had to return it. This unit works exactly like that unit, only newer."
5,Awesome!,Great movie! It's a nice look at relationships and what they mean. The style is very intriguing and captivating. A must see!
4,Sloan and Barri Bring Back Cars and Fun in the Sun,"Most people familar with the best '60's surf and songs know the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. Few know that these studio musicians and back up singers Sloan and Barri put out some classic surf and car music comparable to the best at the time. ""Anywhere the Girls Are"", ""Hot Rod USA"", and ""Summer Means Fun"" are the gems but only a small selection of the good songs on this CD. The harmonies are fine, the guitar playing strong and the lyrics...well it is about cars, surf, sun and fun! If you haven't heard of this ""group"" and appreciate this genre, don't let this CD pass you by!"
3,Item is not polished brass,"I ordered this item to match our antique tub and fixtures. It arrived as chrome instead of brass. Not worth the effort to return. It is exactly as pictured, chrome, not polished brass."
5,Really Great,"To add my couple 'o pennies, I'll say that despite the sound quality not being quite the standard of some great live Zappa records, it still ain't bad; not at all. Vinnie's absolutely tremendous drumming is far more clear than the frustrating recording of Terry's on the otherwise great ""Zappa In New York"" (I wanna hear those nuances!).The ambiance of the concert hall is captured well, along with a good balance of audience appreciation/sound.Being an amazingly well executed gig (as per usual)- tight, fun, raw and overdub-free, with brilliant song variety and unique spins on some of the classics (The Torture Never Stops is a 23 minute tour de force of styles), it adds up to a fantastic capture of a relatively short-lived line-up, ending with a generous and mammoth encore.I highly recommend it.Still available at a reasonable price from the Frank Zappa website."
4,"Deep red, very heavy, sturdy pot","This casserole dish/Dutch oven is extremely heavy, cast iron, in a deep cherry red color. The first one arrived smashed, but Amazon sent me a replacement quickly, which was in perfect condition. You can only use the lid of this dish under 325 degs; my one bubbled up & the plastic started to melt at 350 degs. You can serve around 4 people with this dish."
4,Good price!,"We use this pot often. It holds up well, the only issue we have with it is that the top handle doesn't wear well when put in the oven.Overall, good value!"
3,Problem with lid,I purchased this because the price was great but when I received it there was already damage to the lid and the paint was peeling off. I do not believe it effects the usability of the pot and since the price was so good I decided to keep it. Otherwise it is heavy and a nice pot.
5,pleased,ILOVE THIS DUTCH OVEN...IT'S THE BEST I'VE HAD YET...IT DOES CLEAN EASY AND IT DOES COOK FABULOUSLY...IT IS BETTER THAN THE FRENCH ONE THAT COSTS 239.00......RECOMMEND IT TO ANY COOK
5,This is the best cd I've heard in a long time!,"I've been a huge fan of Kevin Sharp since his first single came out and I have both of his Cd's. The songs just keep getting better and better as you listen. I don't think there's a bad song on here. He sings his songs with such emotion, you can almost feel it. He sings about falling in and out of love and getting through hard times. This is a good CD for someone that can really get into music. Kevin Sharp is definately Country!"
3,Second Effort Doesn't Match First,"Kevin Sharp's second album ""Love Is"" has some bright spots, but it really fails compared to his first album ""Measure Of A Man"".Two songs, ""Kiss The Girl"" and ""If She Only Knew"" are keepers, but the rest seems average at best.One song is missing. ""Love Is All That Really Matters"" was released as a video, but has since disappeared from the CD! It was a nice song, and it would have been welcome on this album.Kevin will probably be around for a long time, though. He's a talented singer with a great voice. Hopefully his next venture will be better."
5,This is the best CD I have heard.,"I am a collector of rare audio, I find cultural relics in the form of old recordings fascinating. I enjoy putting myself into the mindset of past times, it gives life to cultural history, plus the scratchy hollowness and distortion of old records creates a pleasing gothic effect. Together with old religious recordings ones for children are my favorite and I've wished for a CD just like this one for a long time. There's nothing I would change about this CD. The selection is excellent. The mood it creates is so effective that I first heard it on Halloween when someone used it to create atmosphere for trick-o-treaters! I would certainly reccomend it."
2,Too vintage for me,"This collection might appeal to vintage radio enthusiasts, but it was too strange for my taste. Many of the recordings (like ""Grandfather's Clock"") sound rather operatic, not good for sing-a-longs, which I hoped they would be. I was disappointed."
1,The Tower of Alchemy,I was disappointed in the material. The author has a limited understanding of spiritual alchemy of which he bases the entire book on the Hebrew Kabalah. True spiritual alchemy is Egyptian in origin. His meditations are very commonplace and entry level. True alchemical meditations and knowledge are much more advanced and complex than what the author has listed. I stopped reading the book half way through as my own knowledge is much more advanced.
1,A rather boring and insignificant book,"I would have rather given a rating of zero, but had to settle for one star. I found David Goddard's book, ""The Tower of Alchemy"" to be rather unilluminating and a waste of time."
3,"Not what I would have thought of as alchemy, but.....","I was expecting something more directly related to alchemy, but even though it wasn't what I expected, it does seem decent as a pathworking/active imagination technique. Maybe that's his interpretation of a practical application of alchemy - and I guess that's okay if it works for you. Of course, as with all similar techniques, you should use your judgement as to when you're ready for parts of it. The only other thing I want to point out is some problems I had with with his comments introducing the exercises. Though comparative philosophy is an interesting subject, it's a little broad for where he's trying to apply it. So, he ends up lumping together a lot of ideas from different philosophies without making it clear when he's doing that. But, overall I would say this is worth reading."
1,This book is devoid of all substance,"With over 70 years of alchemical practise, I know how to separate the earth from the fire, suavely and with great ingenuity; to separate the chaff from the wheat. This book is 99.9% chaff, and I hereby solemnly warn all readers to steer a wide berth of this misguided effort. Nothing good can be derived from a diseased and sterile seed. That the aforesaid advise is applicable to this piece of very amateurish writing is true without falsehood, certain and most true.O Mortals, diverse indeed is the Council of God, and your convenience, but God hath not decreed that his council should be manifested through sterile seed.Ala V'aga Osomorooff."
1,Complete Disaster,"I'm sorry, I have nothing good to say about this book. It is nothing but a garbled mass of pretentious esoteric gobbledeygook. A major disappointment."
1,"""Exploring Vietnam"" is someone's vacation put on DVD","I am writing this review to tell you that this DVD, which is barely over 30 minutes long, is someone's vacation put on DVD. The camera work is terrible and I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. The explanation of history and how the people live today is lacking in any real substance. The only saving grace of this DVD is that there are many video sequences of the scenery in Vietnam. Not recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about Vietnam"
1,Simply awful!,Save your money and time. There is no content at all in this collection of disjointed scenes and uninspired narration. One gets the feeling this was a class project that was created at the last minute to meet a deadline.
1,shirley bassey standong room only,"This DVD was filmed in a casino in New Jersey... She appears in the most God awful orange gown imaginable, it looks like a halloween costume... The quality is pretty bad, the sound not much better. I was bitterly disappointed after seeing some of her concerts on BRAVO. These concerts have never been available in the states or in Europe, Why is a mystery to me. I sold this back to Amazon for a paltry $1.25 so you can tell by that what I thought of it.I see now Amazon is offering $12.00 for a copy... Well, I sure should have waited...I can't recomment this DVD, it should have been remastered."
3,Deceptive packaging,"I thought this was a DVD of an earlier performance in the 1970's, based on the picture on the front of the DVD. Nevertheless, Dame Shirley was good in this performance. They need to say it was a concert in 1990 with a picture from this event on the cover."
1,soooo dissappointing,"i have only recently discovered and become a Shirley Bassey fan. Her video of 'History Repeating' with the Propellerheads is one of the most brilliant music videos I've seen. I couldn't wait to see ""Standing Room Only"". I could not have been more disappointed. The production value is minimal and poor. Ms. Bassey's performance is unimpressive. She seems tired and bored, no patter with the audience, just cranking out the next song. I got the feeling this was the 2:00 show after lunch and everybody was anxious to get back to the slot machines - including Ms. Bassey."
3,Post Face Lift Bassey,"I adore Shirley Basses, one of the greatest voices of her time, but this performance shows her in decline. As with opera singers, and she has the power of an operatic voice, it starts to decline and eventually goes. Unfortunately Shirley's power and pitch is in declining. If you love her, get the DVD, if not, skip it. There was a special several years ago from England I think. I remember her flying on a hydraulic lift and gold confetti falling. It was fabulous! Why don't they release this on DVD? At least the voice was still incredible. I love Shirley but this DVD certainly is not worth having unless you are a devoted fan. It is not indicative of her great vocal power."
1,"IF DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, THIS ONE IS A FAKE","Bassey! The name means bombastic! Brilliant! The best! But on this DVD ... she comes across as fat and frumpy. Why she allowed this ""concert"" to be taped (years ago in Atlantic City) is beyond comprehension. The gown is unflattering. The face is puffy. The panty bulge noticeable. Yes, the voice is there, but the show gives no hint of her greatness, her power, her dynamic. There is no banter, no flower-tossing, no ""Natalie."" If this is her life, she better trade it in. Fast."
2,dull and boring,this cd is dull and boring. I listened to it once and sold it. Nothing new going on here. Not much else to say. Don't get this.
1,like other products,i have been using Lacinia almost 4 months and everyday.. There is no use to stop hair lost. on the contrary it has expedited...
5,WOW,Unbelievable result in a week Lacinia is not a lotion its a magic. Didnt make my scalp itchy or scurfy and i can see regrowing hairs every day even from the front. After trying Lacinia for a week i trash all minoxidil products.
3,Eso es todo?,"Al ver que Ruben Blades estaría en este disco, aunque ""se retiro"", fue algo bueno, o asi pensaba yo. En solo algunas canciones interpreta él, pero no en todas. Está bien que quiera lanzar otras carreras artisticas, pero si los ""reviews"" profesionales dicen que el canta en todo el disco, eso solo es mala mercadotecnía, y saben que el disco no vendería si el no aparecia en las canciones. Ya que ésta orquestra es conocida, debería tener sus propias melodias y ocacionalmente tocar una pieza que otro artista ya haya presentado."
2,"Good band, a shame they can't play original pieces.","If you are tired of listening to the same soft salsa that is out there, then this is for you.If you are looking for originality, then don't bother.The musicians put together in this album are the top in their genre. Too bad that there is no creative mind to exploit this power with original cuts. All songs are covers.The album only adds the same ole stuff many groups out there have done lacking the creative mind and is just another dull salsa recording.It is a 5 for the straight salsa sound, a -3 for originality."
3,"Buena introduccion a Salsa, no para el veterano","La salsa de este album tiene mucho que esta hecho bien. La voz de Ruben Blades es excellente, y probablemente le hubiese dado cuatro estrellas si el cantara todas las canciones. Pero el problema que tiene es que cuanto todo sea bueno, No hay nada que sea profundamente original. La emocion que se siente no es muy personal, y muchos de los arreglos terminan sonando bastante parecidos."
2,What's The Big Deal?,"This is another glorified top 40 Salsa band. Their repertoire is all covers that pale before the originals. While it may be a good sampler for people who want to dabble in Salsa, the magic of the originals recordings by the original artists towers over this studio band''s versions. Get the originals."
5,Muy Bueno!,I just saw these guys in concert. They played some of the best salsa. I met some of the band members and they are so down to earth! This CD is awesome & a valuable addition to salseros/salseras collection.
4,Great christian music,If you like soulful praise music this is a great christian cd. Think in the vein of Katinas or Salvador
1,At Risk For Tape Damage,"If you think this item will be usefull to avoid wearing out camcorder for rewind, then please reconsider.I tried my Kenyo KV-885 for the first time this morning. It continued to run in rewind mode after reaching the end of tape. You've heard a small electric motor bogg down I'm sure. That was the sound. The motor kept running.I hit the stop button and then eject button to get the tape out. About 1 inch of tape segment was outside of the cassett. Yep it damaged the tape. Guess I am lucky it did't completely destroy the tape.As a service to customers Amazon.com should remove this item from the catalog."
1,Dead out of the Box,"I looked forward to the usefulness of this product. When I plugged it in, I got no power light. After about 5 minutes, I pushed the start button and got power. The start button stayed pushed-in and I couldn't even open the unit door to put in a tape! The stop button was equally worthless. Too bad."
5,Excellent digital recording,"I realize that classical music is something were there is a range of conesuirship, and I represent perhaps the lowest tier of appreciators. In my wholly uniformed opinion, ""Adagio I"" is an excellent classic music collection, containing well-executed pieces ranging from a few instruments to full orchestral ensembles, representing a variety of composers. The digital recording is remarkable, and an unexpectedly full sound comes from the CD. The 2 1/2 length is nice, split onto two disks.My favorite pieces are the justifiably famous ""Suite No.3 In D Major: Air"" and the goose-bump inducing ""Concierto De Aranjuez: Adagio."" The style of the music is mostly soft, and relaxing but there are thrilling moments peppered in. The violin and the guitar have wooed me to contentment many evenings, and do so know as I am writing this review. An enjoyable CD set."
4,be frank,I enjoyed reading this book and got alot of helpful tips that I have needed. Also have read his wife's book. They are great too.
5,I Gave it to All my Friends for Christmas,"The title says it all. I found this book at the library several months ago, brought it home and began using EFT on myself. Not long after, I ordered six copies -- one for myself and five for my friends as Christmas gifts.I used EFT on Sunday to remove a friend's fear of flying. It worked like a charm. I should point out that I am not trained in EFT -- I learned what I need from this book and the book rocks!"
5,Great for my 99 4Runner,My 4Runner has been running great since installing these. Were recommended on the forums as an OEM replacement to the ones that ship with the truck form the factory.
4,Dated but still superb spiritual writing,"I first read this book more than 10 years ago. I loved it then. It really touched me. I recently led a book group discussing this book. Some in the group found it to really touch them deeply giving them the balm they needed; others felt that it was a bit dated. They felt that this was written for a different time.The book's initial purpose, a apology for faith, never really was met, but for the Christian seeking a deeper insight into faith this book is great."
1,PJAGER,"This book has made such an impact on me and others that have read it. The ladies of my church are reading the book as a book study. The fact that a Catholic priest is writing it to his Jewish friend makes it even more far reaching. That this realization that we are the ""Beloved"" is not just for those in particular religious sects. I highly recommend this book. It will open your eyes and your heart and you will learn, step by step, how to claim your belovedness."
1,Confusing and depressing.,I hated this book. As a christian with questions this book did nothing for me. The author had a very interesting take on the chosen people of Jesus. This book is all about broken people and I came out of it utterly depressed. I read it twice back to back and really do not understand why it has so many great reviews. It seems he sort of created this quasi religion out of some of his half baked beliefs and the very non-faithful beliefs of a bunch of his liberal academic friends. I would never recommend this book to anyone who has questions or doubts.
5,good read for the soul,this book helps me to remember that i am much loved. if i can let it seep through my dull heart and mind. all of us are much loved but me telling you won't convince you. maybe if you read this book you can see that the Great Spirit or Higher Power or God or Allah is a loving prescence no matter what state we are in. check it out for yourself. i had this book hanging around for a while then it opened up. i keep it close by.....
5,Human to Human,"This book is simply written, not from the academic prowess of Henri Nouwen, which he certainly has, but from one broken human being to other real people of the everyday. It's really hard to state the profound in simple terms, but Henri Nouwen has done just that. This book takes spiritual principles and applies them to the longing of every human being. It's an easy and quick read, but so worth the effort. I was personally blessed by this small, simple, yet prfound book."
1,No,This book was recommended by an Episcopalian minister but I had no interest in it at all. I did not even finish reading it.
2,BACK with guitar scales,"I picked this one up on my travels in Copenhagen as I was a huge fan of Terror Squad. First up, the production is killer (after that Metallica producer killed their By Inheritence LP) and this is quality thrash played by quality thrash musos, but it just lacks something...The first two songs are rifftastic, but then the riffs on the rest of the CD seem to be as 'feel/groove-less' as playing scales. Needs some chugga! Some ok songs though. Would probably have got 3-4 stars if not for the crap lyrics throughout and too many overdubs of Ronsdorf's vocals. His voice should be heard by itself, the overdubs and effects are just annoying. Drums are provided by Per M Jensen of The Haunted and man he can play."
2,Good for review only,"In my opinion this book should be use for review only, and not for learning Finite math. But maybe that goes without saying for Schaum's books.This book has MANY errors in the solutions to the supplementary questions, so a knowledge of the concepts is already important in order to identify where the authors made mistakes (in the first 46 pages alone, there are 7 incorrect solutions given).But like I said, for reviewing what you may have learned years ago, this is a cheap resource."
2,Very nice,"Shipping was slow and not shipped when promised. I paid extra for quicker shipping, lol, dont do it!!!! Very good quality though"
5,Common language and examples that enlighten a very deep subject.,The entire book is captivating in its simplicity but depth of meaning. Extremely easy to read and gives very practical suggestions for applying the theology to your everyday life.
4,pierre cardin,"Was more than happy with the Pierre Cardin watch l ordered through Amazon. Delivery time to Australia was exceptional, 5 days. Thought the postage was a bit expensive, but the watch was so cheap l was happy with the deal. The response from the recipient was worth it.Thanks again, great service great product."
1,Religious Bigotry,"I was skimming through the book, and he listed about 100 hundred things. He even included all the major religions except for Christianity. His book revealed so much reliigous bigotry. He included Unitarian Universalist and Unity churches as cults. Of course, he included Native American religion/spirituality and African religion/spirituality as cults. The latter definitely gets seriously demonized. Look how Voodoo is depicted. Voodoo is not necessarily bad."
3,Encylopedia of New Age Religions,"If you are looking for an encyclopedia of New Age Cults and Religions, this is a book for you. It does a good job of cataloging a great deal of New Age Cults and Religions as well as some old religions. It is basically a book outlining an antichrist movement. If you are looking for something more, a narrative, or an explanation of a conspiracy, or something very involved about a particular movement, people, or persons this book is not for you."
2,Lacking,"Length:: 5:31 MinsA 5minute video review concerning Texe Marrs Book of New Age Cults & Religions. The purpose of this video is to illustrate some weaknesses in the book which are important for the reader to know. One thing which was forgotten to mention was internal inconsistency concerning Krishnamurti: ""Dejected and embarrased Krishnamurti sailed back to India where, in 1929, he broke away from his sponsors in Theosophy and, in fact, repudiated all connections with organized religions and ideologies."" (233) and ""Finally, in 1931,a dejected Krishnamurti himself abruptly renounced his title of ""Christ"" and became an independent guru..."" (317)."
3,Half-Baked but Useful,"This book is easy to dismiss. Tex Marrs sees dark conspiracies and satanic influences where none exist - or more precisely, where they might exist but are laughably ineffective. Tex Marrs' later books have gone totally over the top. However, in this particular book Tex Marrs has done a creditable job of cataloging the proliferation of New Age Crackpottery that has penetrated deep into both popular and elite culture - even into mainstream Christian organizations. Skeptics and people of faith alike will find this book a useful reference (at least until something better comes along). The book does need to be updated -in the past decade several new crank belief systems have come into prominence."
1,One of the worst religion books ever.,"Mr. Marrs has grotesquely mischaracterized the majority of religions and groups that he examines in his book. While I am not a scholar of religions, I am currently a senior in Religious Studies, and can honestly say that, for the most part, Texe Marrs has no idea what he is talking about."
5,Great Disk for the Price,"I tried cheap DVD-Rs for my movie collection but they fell flat when I tried to use them on my DVD player. Recommend you buy one or two disks to try first before committing to 50 or 100. Once you find a brand that works, stick with it. These Ridata disks work great for me."
2,Not a good brand anymore,There was a time that Ridata/Ritek was a great brand to use but that like many other things has changed. I own a name brand 16x dvd burner that is installed in a highend desktop machine and the best speed I can get from these disks is about 6x - 8x depending on the disc. If I use other brands I get the full 16x. At first when I got the discs I thought it was my machine but when I did a search online I saw that many other people complained about the same thing. To add insult to injury they aren't very good about sending out the rebate either and make it very difficult to resolve the problem. Don't waste your money on Ridata/Ritek products.
2,"Price is okay for 4x, which is what they really are.","4x is the best speed I have gotten with my discs. Not a huge deal, but these will most likely NOT burn at 16x for you."
1,Disasterous loss of data,"I bought a 100 pack of Ridata DVD-R discs and stored valuable computer data and photographs on them. Now, less than two years later, 86 of them have failed. I have tried reading them on five different computers. I will not go near this brand again."
1,Poor quality,Out of a package of 100 I could only get about ten to record. On the rest I had disc error messages. They seem to be of poor quality. Other brands of the same type of disc have not given me any error messages before or since.
1,only burns at 4x with pioneer dvr108,use something else if you want high speed burns. my old ridata 8x will burn at 12x but this media refuses to go more than 4x.
1,no record speed,Have used many types of dvd-r. This the only one I have found that didn't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable. Tried different locations on the spindle and the same results. Would have been a good buy if they worked. Gave it only one star because there was no 1/2 star.
2,Ify at best,"I have been burning for many years, using two multi burn dvd burners (LG). I have used Ritek & Ridata discs before on these burners & haven't had any issues.Until I used these discs. I will say that about 1/4 of them come up with errors. Mostly they look like a record, with series of lines between the information. Burning the same information on another disc type doesn't produce this & the disc is playable.If the price goes well under 18.00/100 than it may be worth throwing 1/4 of them into a landfill (sarcastic). Otherwise, I wouldn't really bother with these discs if you're looking for speed & accuracy. Even slowing down the burn speed doesn't help (in case you're wondering)."
2,Packaging Needs To Be Improved!,This item arrived in a box with very little cushioning material for its weight. The spindle was dammaged and a few the DVD's were cracked. Where's the QC?
3,"GOOD PRICE, SLOW SPEED","The actual product is very good for a low price. The problem is speed. It claims 16x speed, but these disks will only burn at 4x speed. I have used other brands that have burned at the full 16x speed. I guess it depends on your burner, but buyer beware, you may be waiting a while for your burn."
2,Works Kinda,I have used these discs on 4 types of burners lite-on 16x won't even start. Sony 16x work but only up to 12x then they slow down to 6x and stay there. Pioneer 4x work fine. Pioneer 12x have to try mutiple times to get the burn started and then they only burn at 8x. These are not the ritek DVD-R discs I used in the past. I have had much better results with sony 16x.
1,"Pilfered shipment, damaged","THe container of DVDs had been cut open, apparently before packaging for shipment. Over twenty discs were missing, and the remainder were covered with dust and debris. The discs were packed loosely, and rolled freely inside the box. Amazon sent me a label to print out for return shipping of the box for a refund, but it's been a week and a half since I mailed it back and I have yet to receive acknowledgement."
5,Wonderful lyrics with a combination of heart and gusto!,"This CD is bound to be looked back on as the one that a lot of people overlooked. With the release of Matt's second album, I am sure his career will get the recognition so much talent deserves. This album has a wonderful blend of heart felt lyrics and up beat tunes that will keep both sides happy and listening. I reccomend it!"
5,Just what we were looking for,"Bought this to ""girl up"" my daughter's hand-me-down Sansa. It fits great, and hasn't torn a bit despite constant tugging from a little girl."
2,Oops - should have read the fine print!,I thought I was paying for 2 bottles or perhaps 3! Much too expensive for just 1 bottle. I should have paid closer attention.
3,Not a bad licensed game,Hard to rate this game as just being Fett is so cool. The graphics were OK for a Cube game and some levels were quite fun. It loses major points for a jerky camera angle and some missions where you have to run long distances and backtrack.
5,GTA + STARWARS + HALO= you lose xbox and this is a winner,"in a sense this is gta 3, it has a huge arsenel of guns, weapons and anything that gta has but its better because of the huge levels (fly...yes fly over courasunt, the nyc of starwars,) and if you look at the other pix you will see the carnage of jango fett. NOTE TO ANYONE WHO HAS CLONE WARS... THE DEMO VID U GET ON THAT GAME IS NOT THE REAL DEAL...THE GRAFIX ARE MUCH BETTER and if you prefer being a jedi than try jedi outcast."
4,not a bad game,"this game seems really cool, the only problem is you only can be the bounty hunter. the good thing is you get different types of weapons and you have to defeat bad guys. so if you like being different people you only can be the bounty hunter. like it says on the cover.Anyway, you go to different planets too."
5,BOUNTY HUNTER!...,"Out of all the Star wars games i have played i enjoy this game the most, You take on Small armies basicaly and you can have fun using fancy backflips and rolls. The controls are simple and using all of jango fets gadgets including, Ordanary laser pistol, a jet pack and even the flame thrower!!! You are a mercanary and yoou must capture or kill bountys that can even be Hostile!! I give it 5 stars."
1,BAD!!!!!!!!,"Really, be honest. This has got to be the WORST LucasArts game out there, besides the fact that they all are really horrible. The game has no real objective, besides get the bounty on an alien, while shooting five hundred others that look exactly alike. The gameplay is like a broken record.1st, you scan an alien.2nd you capture him dead or alive.3rd repeat the process for 18 levels, while being blasted by dozens of other aliens that don't die until they have about fifty red hot laser beams in them.I really fooled myself buying this without renting it first...I wasted --- dollars on a game that isn't worth two. The long and the short of it? Do not buy this game, unless you like to be driven to the nearest padded room in a white coat..."
2,Decieving,"The first time I heard of this game I thought it was a must have. I thought it would be awesome to play as my favorite star wars character. In fact, once I got a Gamecube, it was the first game I got. Here are the pros and cons of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter.pros:1-You get to play as the most feared Bounty Hunter in the galaxy.2-You have all the weapons Jango has in the movies.3-It has a good plot.cons:1-Levels are way to long and hard. Sometimes you don't even know what the heck you have to do to advance.2-Graphics could use a little bit more work.3-It's only one player. This game would be awesome if you could play cooperative.I would suggest renting this game before actually buying it, to see if you like it or not."
5,Jango rules,"well i can't really find anything wrong about this game so i give it 5 stars. the weapons are awesome, jango's armor is realisticley burned and scared. so go ahead and buy it! or at least rent it."
1,Bad Graphics and Gameplay,"This game is utterly terrible. They could have made this game so much more better. Instead of actually getting credits to buy possibly different items, your credits are turned into secret pictures which is terrible. Every bounty you get will reveal a different concept art piece, so basicly it ruins the bounty part of the game with an also bad storyline and plot. I would stick to either Metroid Prime or RE and RE0, which are much better combat games. This game also had bad camera angles so unless you are some person who likes to look at pictures and a comic book don't buy this game. There is 0 replay value too which adds to this disaster."
3,a little too easy,"It's a great game but I think you might just want to rent it first. It was fun it was so easy. It only took me one day to beat. After you rent it if you liked it you should get it. I was entertained for over 3 hr. pretty good game, dude!"
1,This Is The Real Review!,"This Games Blows because it's so logical. You have to get through puzzles and stuff. Its not even fun to use the jetpacks.Its disapointing. If your hurting for some real star wars action, I highly recommend Star wars jedi knight 2 Jedi outcast."
4,"My Backpack's Got Jets! I'm Jango, the Fett!","I'll keep this short, Bounty Hunter was a really great game for it's time. Compared to games now, the graphics are nothing to write home about and the storyline could've used some touching up, but in the grand scheme of things, this game is still a lot of fun to play. I originally owned it for PS2 until someone stole the console from me. I ordered the Gamecube version and it arrived ahead of schedule and in good condition. Overall, it's a fun concept to run around tying people up with your wrist cable and dragging them around. The game play does get a bit repetitive, but if you enjoy Star Wars as much as I do, then you're so immersed in what you're doing that it doesn't bother me too much. I gave it 4 stars simply because it's an older game and because of the slight repetitious nature of the game itself. Final Rating: B+"
4,Let the Hunt Begin,"This game is story breaches the gap between Episode I and Episode II, specifically weaving the story of how Jango Fett became the template for the clone army. An interesting concept for Star Wars games by letting you play as a bounty hunter collect your bounties and hunting down people with the ultimate goal of hunting down a rouge Sith. You have arsenal of weapons one would expect Jango to have that making the game a pleasant experience to play."
5,"Undoubtly, The BEST GAME EVER!","Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, is without a doubt, th8e best action\adventure game ever, easy rivaling HALO and Zelda: Ocarina of Time. YOu take on the role of Jango Fett in his mission to find the leader on a secret cult...Dead or a Alive. You access to a huge arsenal of weapons, including toxic darts, flamethrowers, sniper rifles, and my favorite, dual blaster psitols. You also have unlimited access to Jango's jet pack. What could be cooler than see that there are guys shooting at you from another building and rocket up and forward and blast them with your pistols from the air? The graphics are simply incrediable. The game pushes Gamecube's proccessor to the limit(imagine that!). Pre order this now. To all X-Box owners, IN YOUR FACE!!!"
4,"JANGO,THE COOLEST OF THE COOLEST","THIS GAME IS AWESOME,IT GIVES ME HOURS AND HOURS OF FUN,I'M SUCH A BIG FAN OF JANGO FETT AND GIVING HIM HIS OWN GAME WAS GREAT,THE GRAPHICS ARE WELL DETAILED (look at the Coruscant scene)AND THE WAY YOU ELIMINATE YOUR ENEMIS IS REALLY ENTERTAINING,IT'S FUN WHEN YOU BURN'EM WITH YOUR FLAMETHROWER AND THEY RUN SCREAMING ON FIRE,THIS GAME IS GREAT,IT'S A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STAR WARS FAN LIKE ME"
2,Dissapointment,"Looking at the promotions and reviews of the game, I decided to purchase it and unfortunately it was a huge dissapointment. All I have to say is play either Metroid Prime or Jedi Knight Outcast and them play Bounty Hunter. You too will be disapointed. THe idea and concept of the game is awesome, I just wish more time had been put into the graphics and game play. Once again Lucas disapoints."
3,"Fun for a while, but loses its appeal","Bounty Hunter had a lot of great graphics (for its time), gameplay, and even a decent story. But at times it just got too tough and frustrating. After a while, it got boring trying to fight so many enemies. At some points, it's not even clear what to do. I wish there had been an easier mode (and I consider myself a video game vet)."
4,Most Relentless Player,"My name is most relentless player because Ive been at it for three years.Im not even done,Im on level fourteen out of eighteen.And theres you should know,I feel bad about this but in year one I used a cheat code to get past the whole game.But in two months of extra levels I punished myself and restarted the whole thing.And (luckily)because of playing and winning the final level and seventeen I was much better.But I learned something wierd about the game,although some levels are higher there not the hardest.I say level fourteen is the hardest.I could be wrong,I could be right youll have to find out.But overall its fun,great graphics,and a good plot.If your a diehard Star wars fan,buy it,if you just want to try it out rent it."
4,Broken Heart,"Toni Braxton has always found ways to seduce so many men in the music industry. Still, there is nothing that can strike a man in the heart better than a sad song. Unbelieveably, that is how I believe it anyway for men to really understand woman. That also comes with the case on songs too. How Could An Angel Break My Heart is that kind of a sad love song that really knows all about broken hearts. The song features Kenny G playing in the background. It is just a beautifully enchanting melody that just makes you cry from the soul and the mind. I just don't understand why music isn't like this all the time. Not the fact that it makes you cry, but that the fact is that it is just a very simple song, without letting the artist sell, but the music sell for what the meaning is suppose to. I just hope that Toni can keep delivering great songs like this again soon."
3,Sublime Elvis,"I suppose some folks feel that "" Jailhouse Rock"" was Elvis, best film. Other prefer ""King Creole"" ( A Stone for Danny Fisher) , myself I prefer this 1957 entry because it was his first color film..and much more.We are aware that Elvis, mom was in the audience during the filming in that theater scene. I suppose this was one reason why Elvis didnt watch this film much after the passing of his mom.There is nothing special abut the story ( its really his). The cast of Wendell Corey and Lizabeth Scott make it happen and adds some real character to the plot line. The songs , I think are Elvis, best. That includes the bridge "" Hot Dog"" and "" Cowboy""Finally, this film has one of the few performances of Dolores Hart. Even the sweet Judy Tyler couldnt match Ms. Hart,s sincerity in performance. The original sound track on vinyl is worth big dollars. This is the way I like to remember Elvis.!!"
2,Not Useful,"The fact that I cannot play this CD on my DVD player, It was not made clear that this itemwas from the United Kingdom, there virtually useless in the USA, unless you like viewing this CD on your computer. Which I do not."
5,old classic,Happy to add this to my growing collection! Arrived in great shape and fast too! Elvis at one of his best!
2,Didn't really work,I think sometimes your just SOL when it comes to pregnancies searing heartburn. I had hopes that it would work but it didn't.
1,Very realistic -- NOT!,Not his best. Bad story and poor acting. I understand why it was a box office bust.
2,about the movie half past dead......,"I have seen this movie before and there are some people whom are disappointed with this movie/film. This, I could say, is not a very nice movie to watch for some especially how this story is set etc. A recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film. Enjoy...."
2,"I'm not a Segal fan, so maybe my vote doesn't count...","I was never a fan of Steven Segal. I found his movies a lot like Van Dam's -- pure action, no plot and little (if any) notable actors. This film is no exception. The other main stars are Morris Chestnut (spelling?) and Ja Rule...wow what a relief! The films plot evolves around an undercover FBI agent (Segal -- of course!) who gets busted with a stolen car (just a cover) with his criminal friend (Ja Rule). Their sent to the pen and soon after the pen is taking over by a group of 'terrorist?' who want some money they are owed. Not much plot, too much action, no good actors and little (if any) direction. No wonder this film stayed in post-production for almost two-years -- Steven Segal, please quit deluting our cinema with this garbage!"
4,Good action support a good flick!,"The plot has been done over many times but just the sheer action level of the movie will keep you entertained for 95 minutes. I'm sorry Seagal even though you're lived right near me, I have to give the best acting award to Ja Rule, who for once didn't die at the end of a movie (check out his breakout role in ""Turn It Up"") lifted the movie from being another dumb action flick like the average ""Ballistic- Ecks vs. Sever"". About 7/10"
3,Half Past Dead,"Sascha Petrosevitch is a widowed undercover agent posing as a tough, international car thief. He has many friends on both sides of the law. One of them, career criminal Nick Frazier, has been like a brother to him. One night while on a heist job, Sascha and Nick are intercepted by a female FBI agent, EZ Williams, who, unbeknownst to Nick, is working in tandem with Sascha. Nice action movie."
2,Better than I thought it would be but nothing too impressive,"When I first saw the trailer for Half Past Dead I thought film would be allright but then I found it was PG-13 and named it a stinker on arrival. I'll admit my opinon was wrong while the film isn't Segal's best it's not his worst either. The action seqeunces in the film are okay, I think there could have been more martial arts fights and Ja Rule is good as alwayas. Morris Chestnut makes a good bad guy (he hasn't played one since The Inkwell) and Kurput is good in his small role. The film is full of errrors and non believeable stunts but if you're willing to look past that and just wanna waste 90 min then do so with this film. It's not bad or good just aight."
4,A Surprise,"The cable channel I watched this on rated it with one star and gave it a bad review. But it was desperation time so I figured what the heck I'll watch this.My husband won't stay in the room when a Seagal movie is on but I have enjoyed most-not all-of his films. It's like Stallone, Arnold,Bronson or early Eastwood sometimes you're a fan of the action film. I actually heard a famous reviewer heave a big sigh and say ""If you're a fan of Charles Bronson you'll love this movie"". Well, I love these movies and that's it.If you haven't already seen it rent Glimmer Man it's really good."
3,PRETTY GOOD TO ME,"I liked this movie. Although Segall seems to be gaining weight and looks a little bloated , his martial arts are still on track. Ja Rule was a pleasent surprize as an actor and the rest of the cast was fine also. People just want to diss the movie because its not some deep mind study of prision life. Its an action flick. Reality has to bend a little. By the way... Nia Peebles plays a great charter in this movie. She looks fantastic in the skin-tight outfit and she can fight like the devil. Her stunts looked fantastic. If she could she should make a movie herself with this type of character she might hit it big. Reccommened."
1,"Embarrassing, even for Seagal","I've only seen this one on cable, and it's about as ludicrous as you'd expect (although it is amusing the lengths the movie goes to to keep the portly Seagal *off* camera). It's like the really crappy movie on late night cable that you happened to come upon. As a matter of fact, it *is* that crappy late night cable movie I came upon!My real question, though, is this: who the heck is this Jeff Shannon who writes so many editor reviews for Amazon? He writes fluff reviews for even the most abominable flicks -- take his blurb here for this piece of garbage: 'Half Past Dead isn't half bad'. Huh?! Name *one* movie that's more incompetently made from top to bottom, more ineptly directed and acted, and more insulting to its supposed audience. I'm astounded that this ever got a theatrical run -- it's direct to video all the way.This one even makes some of Seagal's mediocre movies look like classics in comparison. 'Fire Down Below' is 'Die Hard' compared to this."
1,No.,I refuse to believe that anyone would give this rag 5 stars. Just trying to find some balance.Donate your money to an animal shelter before you buy something as stupid as this.
4,Still better than most Van Damme movies,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, but it was suprisingly tolerable. The fight scenes are good, although I don't like those lame camera effects where something's in slow motion, then suddenly it's in fast motion for 2 seconds, then back to slow motion. Nia Peeples was awesome. I've never seen her like this before. This makes me forget about her lame charactor in The Blues Brothers 2000. The bad guys are led by Morris Chestnut, who was Segeal's sidekick in Under Siege 2 as the porter on the train. He does a decent job as the villian. Then, of course, there's a couple of rap singers trying to get into acting. Ja Rule and Kurupt (?) They're acting is okay, but I don't see them winning any academy awards for Best Supporing Actor in this movie. This dvd is worth checking out if you like Steven Segeal movies. It's already in the ""cheap"" section at certain stores. I guess that's just because only 4 people saw the movie in the theater."
3,Ah but the fight scenes...,I ususally sit there and yawn at fight scenes [Shades of TV Batman] in movies but the pace and the direction in this one hooked me. Worth it to kills some time and some popcorn when you want to shut your mind off. If you are out to be totally impressed... Why are you watching movies like this anyways?
3,Overweight Segal battles on...,"This really is a pretty good movie. I can see why no one wanted to pay ten bucks at the theater, but it has moments. I guess you have the plot from the other reviews, but its the type of movie where you must suspend you belief in physics and logic. When thats done sit back and marvel at gunfire everywhere yet hardly anyone gets hit. Massive explosions that hardly hurt anyone and a overwight Segall fighting like a 20 year old against all in his way. Mia Peeples lights up the screen with her charcter. A hell bent woman which has no emotion, no fear, and can kick major booty with Segall at his best. (Plus the skin tight outfit she wore made it easy to enjoy her.) Thats it from the front row."
3,Works for a while,"It worked great the entire time that my dog was on it and for a short period of time after I stopped giving it to him, but then he went right back to his nasty little habit. I have used it several times with him and every time it works while he takes it but stops working when he stops taking it. I have used it with both my dog and cat (to keep the dog from scrounging through the litter box). This is the only product that I have found on the market that is safe for both dog's and cat's. I would be interested to see if it has curbed anyones pet completly."
3,It worked for about a week.,"I have two Australian Cattle dogs and the female, Daisey, loves to eat...well the stuff that comes out of their behind. After a few days of using this it worked quite well and we thought it was going to do the trick. After the second week Daisey was back to her bad habit. I'm sure if it was most any other dog it would work quite well, but my Daisey is EXTREMELY stubborn and if she wants something bad enough she will get it. We even poured hot Tobasco sauce on the waste and that only slowed her down a little bit...One other thing is that in to the second week it gave both dogs horrible gas to where we almost couldn't stand to be in the same room with them."
3,I'm not sold,"I'm not sold on this one. It might have helped but it isn't as effective as they claim. If your dog is eating thier poop, the best way is to keep an eye on them when outside and train them to leave it be. This didn't help much...if at all."
3,"The ""Green Books"" still right on.","This is one of the Army's ""Green Book"" series. All of them are very well written but they are geared for the military historian. This is a reprinted copy and dose not contain all of the maps of the the original,which was disappointing."
2,Digital woes,"Having read this book before I was thoroughly disappointed by the version delivered to my new kindle. I like the green book series and was looking forward to re-reading this electronically. The kindle version is riddled with typographical errors that swing between amusing, confusing and irritating . It's also devoid of any of the original images or maps.If you're looking for a good overview of the okinawa campaign then by all means buy this book, yes it is short on first person accounts but it is well written with a good level of detail .Buy it yes, but only the hardcopy version. The kindle version isn't worth the paper it isn't written on."
4,"The TI-68, why did they discontinue it?","The TI-68 is a fine calculator. A search on Google of ""TI-68"" will bring up plenty of positive reviews."
4,very charming book,"Excellent and funny book with a lot of illustrations. I purchased it about 10 years ago in USA with Jim Kepner's ""Becoming a people..."" and Terry Boughner's ""Out of All Time"". They are very nice and intersting volumes. In these books, however, we can find only the occidental people with few exceptions ; e.g. Mishima Yukio, Suleiman . Though English has become nowadays as if a kind of LINGUA FRANCA , I don't understand why the English speaking people still have such a narrow-minded thinking. I'd like to read more international, global and comprehensive books.PS : Noel I. Garde's ""Jonathan to Gide : The Homosexual in History"" also is a very intersting book of ""The Gay-people's List"" , although it is on the westerners including some Oriental men like Abu Nuwas and Saladin."
1,Ben,"This is possibly the worst video game ever made. You have a machine gun and are supposed to shoot down enemy planes. You don't see the planes until they are right in front of you for about one second before they fly overhead. This game probably took about half an hour to make from start to finish. It is completely two dimensional, it has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I was completely tired of it after about 15-20 seconds of playing. I gave it one star because that's the lowest rating available. The actual rating would be about negative 4 stars. Don't buy it."
1,Historical Features as Bonus Items are Good,"OK ... this game looks like something made for Windows 3.1 or games from around the early Win95 era. BUT ... the one good thing ... there is a nice historical feature - when you start the game, you can either play or choose this option. You hear the radio broadcast of the Pearl news and see a full screen phote with FDR and all the congressmen seated around him as he stands at the podium and gives his famous ""Day of Infamy"" speech. Or you can view the time-line - I actually learned a fact or two that I didn't already know."
1,A Rip-Off,"This game tries to capitalize on the familiarity of the Pearl Harbor name.I was completely disappointed in 10 seconds and I have purchased lesser priced games knowing that there was a reason for the lower price. There is no conceivable reason for this game other than what it is, a complete rip-off!"
1,The worst game ever,I've played better games than this on the internet (WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BUYING THIS GAME) by the way if you really want this game email me at ztcm1013@msn.com
5,A good mental attitude in sport wins 90% of the time,"Sports Psyching gives you a roadmap to achieving your personal best in sport through mental training. Combined with the testing program by Dr. Tutko, called The Mental Game Plan, a test that appraises your attitudes against thousands of other athletes, this information allows you to implement a plan for better game performance and improved communication between coach and athlete."
5,great project for a independent newcomer,"melodious praise is an awesome group. The Cd is anointed spiritual, thoughtprovoking and inspirational. My favorite cut is churchin the remix. It's funny yet truthful in looking back at the old days of church going. I like King of kings it's funky yet powerful in its delivery. The other songs all folow a cycle of the prophecy of jesus's birth through his death and resuurrection and the Jesus is sure, reminds us that he will reurn one day. It's great. the vocals are great> I especially enjoy yhte variety of lead vocalist. from powerful sounds of vickie woodard herself, to tracy and darius you lead an inspiring ballad called ""in my frustration"". It is just a blessed project."
3,21st Century Sewing,It's a little outdated for someone that really want to learn to sew. I knew as much as the dvd had to teach me.
3,Gossipy self-portrait,"I've been a fan of Helmut Newton since I was about 13 when, Woody Allenish, I miraculously happened upon his pictures of women. Unfortunately this book captures none of the excitement those pictures generate. He tells of growing up in Nazi Germany, his escape to China and his move to Australia. He also shares many (and there are many to share) of his sexual exploits. The problem I had, is if you take the pictures out of the book, it could almost be about anybody with an overactive libido (or imagination). All-in-all it is a gossipy read and amusing at that level but with very little to indicate what makes Newton's photographs some of the most recognizable around. If you're thinking about this book because you know his work, consider one of the books containing his photographs instead."
3,A revealing look at an innovative artist,"I enjoyed reading the author's recollections, even though sometimes I wondered if they were wishful thinking (find it hard to believe that a 21 year old woman would be interested in a 14 year old boy - re: the bus story).The only annoying part was having to constantly switch to the back of the book to read the photo illustrations."
2,Short lifespan,"I bought these expecting a decent pair of sunglasses, I have a Fossil watch so I am familiar with the quality of their brand. I am very careful with my sunglasses to avoid damage. After approx. 2 months of use one of the arms snapped. I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement pair under warranty. Things were mostly OK after that -- the screw in one of the hinges worked itself loose causing the arm to fall off (easy to fix though I shouldn't have to), and part of the frame chipped somehow. Then shortly after the warranty expired the arm snapped again. Perhaps I just had bad luck, but I won't buy Fossil brand sunglasses again."
3,Average glasses for a not so average price,"When I bought these glasses they were about $40, I am careful with glasses, and I used thes only for driving. The fit was fine, but my eyes grew tired after a couple hours on long trips. I was disappointed that they weren't polarized. Frankly, ALL sunglasses should be polarized. There is no excuse for them not to be. But caution these are NOT polarized.Also, the lenses seemed to incur scratches rather easily."
5,The best How-To Book on Reading Charts,"I've been reading charts since the 1960s and still found much to savor in this book. Cunningham is a master of sorting out the important from the background noise.The more we learn and the more astrological factors we know about, the more complex it can become to read a chart. Cunningham takes us back to the basics in a way that brings new richness to every chart you will read.Thanks Donna!"
3,"Nice try to ""commercial""bombastic?",I adore both Sunn o)))And BorisBoth bands Sunn's special 2 cd editions are just incrediblesame with Boris Great great bandthe problem is.;its like too short...and it gets boring quite quicklyhowever if you are a boris or sunn o))) fanor you would like to hear a more accesible Sunn o))) By all means get this.But get like all sunn cds .;you have this the 1 cd..Or The 2 cd package with an extra cd with every sunn release.With Altar you get in the 2 cd version:Her lips where wet with venom 25 min+ So do not get this single cd version!!!If you like Sunn.;you need thisBut its my least favouriteI also dont think the bands really got the results that could have been.Gety all Sunn and Boris releases insteadThey are all 5 star!!!!!
2,Only 2 Music Videos!,"Save your money. I expected to see ""Come on Over "" video. Nothing. There were only 2 music videos on this tape/DVD, whichever you decide to buy. I recommend Madonna 93:99 or Jennifer Lopez - Feelin' Good. Now those tapes/DVD (I have both on DVD) are packed w/Music videos!"
5,A Must Have,"Christina Aguilera is number one. The dvd version contained behind the scene footages as well as a collage of her best songs turned into unforetable music videos. The video editing is excellent for it demonstrated her artistic dancing abilities and the clean cut from one scene to the next. The audio is great, but I wish for more live performances instead of audio dubbing from her cd. I was at her great america concert and it was the bomb. I wish it included some more footages and songs from that concert as well as a subtitle to sing along. I had no idea she was so talented and silly."
5,Wow!,"I was surprised at how wonderful this video was. The only thing I would change was how long you see her in the studio. You watch her sing an entire song, which gets old. Other than that, it was great. They show amazing performances, signings, fans, and songs. Well done Christina!"
2,It's good if you like Play Back,"I'm quite dissapointed of this video. I have seen ""Time out with Britney"" and It was amazing; real concert scenes and the sound was great (5.1 Digital). But this one of Christina is dissapointed that presents her performing on stage but they put the record song, no the one that is live. And moreover, the sound is not Digital. However you have a chance to know more about Christina and if you like her, you spend a good moment."
2,nothing spectacular,"if you think this is a must-have or a keeper then this is not it. however, if you're a young impressionable aguilera fan then you'll buy it. but if you're someone like me who knows a talent when i see one yet never bias and always objective, i recommend you not to buy this DVD albeit aguilera is a superstar, buy her CD instead!"
4,VIDEO IN A BOTTLE,"THIS IS A OK VIDEO IT IS COOL YOU GET A 2000 CALNDER POSTER.AND I LIKE THAT YOU GET TO SEE THE VIDEO OF""GENIE IN A BOTTLE"" AND HEAR A B-SIDE SONG ""AT LAST"" BUT EVERYTHING,IT IS OK."
1,Baby blues to die for !,Brittany Spears eat Christina's dust! What a boy wants is Christina Aguilera. Those cool blue eyes warm my heart. One thing though she has to lose the clown in the what a girl wants video. clowns bad. Christina good.
1,"CHRISTINA THIS AIN'T ENOUGH, RELEASE ALL OF EM!","I REALLY, REALLY, REEEEEAAAAAALLLLLLY WISH CHRISTINA AGUILERA WOULD RELEASE A VIDEO COLLECTION WITH ALL OF HER VIDEOS, BRITNEY HAS DONE THAT, WHY HAVEN'T YOU, CHRISTINA?! I REALLY WANT YOUR VIDEOS ON DVD!!! THESE TWO ARE CUTE BUT LEAVE ME WANTING A LOT MORE! OKAY, WELL, THE VIDEOS FROM 'STRIPPED' ARE TRASHY AND AT TIMES JUST PLAIN SCARY BUT I REALLY WANT THE VIDEOS FROM HER DEBUT AND HER SIDE PROJECTS LADY MARMALADE, NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY, THE CHRISTMAS SONG AND CAR WASH.....CHRISTINA, I BEG YOU!!!! RELEASE A VIDEO COLLECTION, YOU KNOW THE FANS ALL WANT IT!!!"
3,"Decent, not great set of tools. Name somewhat deceptive",A decent but not great set of tools for doing work such as hobbyist electronics. Beware that the precision title is a little misleading. I expected at least one of the needle-nose pliers to have a smaller set of jaws for very small/precision work. Also would have expected some of the screwdrivers to be jewelers size. Also be aware that 20 of the 39 pieces are blades.
4,"Good Quality, nice cases dissappointed with the screw drivers..","Good Quality, nice cases dissappointed with the screw drivers. The pliers and the razor cutters were well made and sturdy, the cases they came in were additionally well made and sturdy. The only disappointment were the screw drivers, the ends of 3 of them fell off and they didn't seem as sturdy as the rest of the items in the set. Took a while to get here, but overall I'm very happy with the set."
3,"3 stars, more like 3 1/2 ... The plier set is worth the money ...","The precision screwdriver set in this kit is an improvement of the one in the Denali 52 piece screwdriver set.The main attraction of this kit is the six piece plier set. Those are indispensible for fine work: modeling, small electronics repair, ever small Bonsai (for those who don't know, copper wire is often used to train the branches of specimens).Xcelite (among others) makes premium pliers sets - at a premium price, too. Exacto makes better blade handes. But for the money, this kit ain't half bad."
4,Excellent Combination!,This book was a very good read. It gave you a taste of the writing styles of each author. I've read several of Niobia Bryant's books but this is the first I've read of Schuster and White. I believe I'm hooked on there work as well! I would definitely recommend!
5,Real Stories About Real Life,"I could not put this book down! Three of the best Arabesque authors all in one book! The three stories were real - the cyber-reality-speed dating life for professionals of color! Each heroine had it together as well as each brotha' Of course not all cyber-reality-speed dating stories end up well (take from one who tried!) but these storeis were real -the doubts, the safety issues, the stigmas are all here! Melaine Schuster's ""Chain of Fools"" has a WONDERFUL treausre in her story - Walter Benton's ""This is My Beloved"" Please look on Amazon for the recording by Arthur Prysock - listen to the sample - you will buy a copy on the spot as I did! A wonderful - erotic- romantic find! Now I know where Barry White got his stuff!!!! Ladies! Please do this again!!!!:)"
4,Very Good Read,The book was very interesting. I would recommend it. I am always looking for books with more than one author. Melanie Schuster is one of my favorite authors. A very good read.
5,"Finally, a band leading country into the 21st century.","""Break In the Storm,"" an Alantic release of an already published album, is a shining star in the country music world. Off the beaten path of pop country songs that have no meaning, The Great Divide's songs spellbound a wide variety country music styles. Having two videos on CMT (that should be shown more often), The Divide has only just begun in the music world and if marketed correctly could be the next best thing to come out of Stillwater, Okla. since Garth."
5,exciting and stimulating--definately worth listening to!,These guys are the best thing to happen to country music in a long time. Their sound is great in a laid-back kind of way! Its one CD that won't get left behind when I pack for the beach! Keep up the good work!
5,I LOVE IT!,WHAT CAN I SAY ...? THIS CD IS THE BEST ONE I BOUGHT! IT IS ALL GOOD THERE IS NOT ONE SONG I DONT LIKE ACTUALLY BOUGHT 2 ONE FOR HOME AND ONE FOR WORK.
1,Does not store,"Easily pops open, but it will stay that way forever. I'd give a reward if someone could come get the thing to fold up for storage. The directions are junk! And it's huge."
1,Impossible to close,"Although this may be very easy to assemble and very entertaining for kids, it does take up a lot of space and is impossible to close and put away."
4,a challenge to us all,A well illustrated book and it has a message of hope and fear. The boys fleeing from danger is somthing that I see in the news but this put a reallity check on it. Well worth reading it to your children
4,"fourth edition still good, but third edition better","The fourth edition is an excellent compendium, although the third edition was better even if it was shorter. The fourth edition errs in including too many fringe poets (from what Harold Bloom calls the School of Resentment) from the past and from the present. One would prefer to see more material from authors who must be read in quantity, such as Whitman, Pound, and Auden, rather than bits and pieces from a hundred recent poets. However, there are some welcome additions to the selection of contemporary British poets such as Peter Porter and R. S. Thomas."
4,All about English Poetry,"This one is great book for the students who major in english literature.I know this book is really heavy for carrying but it worth.You can find most of important poetry and little explanation.You can find short history about english poetry and every poet in the book, too.Every thing is perfect but I can't give 5 stars.Because binding is'nt good enough. It's too weak binding for heavy one like this.And there's another reason.There's a lots of differnces between each edition.I couldn't find some of my favorite poem.So, I gave 4 stars.Anyway I love this one."
1,Nautica five pocket jeans classic fit,"I rate a one star because the jeans, my son likes, BUT the rivets on the back pockets have ruined my dining room chairs and my leather recliner AND my car's leather seats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thought anyone who plans on buying them should be AWARE!!!"
5,La Oreja de Van Gogh es buenísimo!!!!,"This album contains a concert CD and a DVD. The DVD also includes music videos, interview, photos and of course concert. It is worth to buy and you can find that Amaia sings really well. There is no difference between CD version and live version!!!"
5,Great board. Spend the money for it!!,"Recently bought this board to upgrade from my 12 dollar piece of crap. I love it! I would highly recommend buying this board over just about any one that I have played on. Spend the money up front to avoid headaches. Darts rarely bounce out, easy to use features, easy to mount, holds two sets of darts, and is regulation. The only thing I would change is having more volume settings. The darts it comes with are lousy, but a decent set of darts is only around ten dollars. Highly recommend it. Really. Stop reading this review and buy it!!"
2,"Electronics off on day one, sending it in...","Looks nice, installs easy, and has many game options, however the 20 registers as a 5 80% of the time and the 1 registered as a 6 at about the same rate. This occurred from the first time I played. I will be sending it back."
1,"I had to ""massage"" this thing to life.","For a product that costs over 100 dollars, the packaging was surprisingly cheap. 10 dollar action figures have better packaging than this dartboard. I turned it on and realized that only 2 numbers functioned. I literally had to ""massage"" the entire board with my thumbs and miraculously brought the whole thing to life in 20 minutes. A few numbers still don't react to the darts but a few kneads with my thumbs sort of made it a bit better. I wanted to pay more to insure that I get a higher quality board, but i was mistaken."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this item hoping it would stand up to our family of four and our love to play darts. The item worked for about one hour. Three of the six darts broke within that first hour also. It seemed if you threw a dart too hard or near the center, the machine just simply went ""black"". We had to start our game all over again. It was disappointing with the cost of the game and discription stating it is durable. We returned it."
1,crash unplayable.,the board simply went crazy restarting every time i switch on the board. it looks okay on the first day everything was find with few bounce out.if you think of getting this board look somewhere else.
3,On 2nd Set,"Arrived from Amazon, plugged it in, and immediately smelled some burning smell. Was able to select game but within a minute, electronics stopped working so must have shorted out. Amazon was great with the exchange, UPS picked up defective the next day and received new Arachnid one day later. Have only played for a couple hours but new set is working fine. Not a big fan of heckler but can easily turn off. Volume is very loud but adjustable (or can turn off). Scoring is bright and easy to read. Although I didn't see other reviews with this issue - I have run into some non-counts when I changed to next player (and darts stuck). It would be great if selecting games were a bit more intuitive than G1, G3, G5... but there are a few default games with their own buttons (basic cricket, 301). To play other than the few defaults, you need to refer to your manual when toggling through options. For price - seems like a good board but if more serious, may want to go for their more expensive model"
1,Unfixable error after 2 weeks,"Extremely disappointed. It worked well for the first 2 weeks, then an error developed that can't be fixed. I can't even open the frickin thing because there is a warranty seal on it. In order to get it fixed, I have to pay the return shipping for their original non-working product, then possibly a fee on top of that. Absolutely horrible business practice to make the customer pay return shipping for a product that fails within the warranty period. Seeing if I can get an exchange through Sams Club so I don't have to send it to the company.3 bad reviews, to 8 good ones should tell you not to buy this product. For DMI Sports, Inc. it is inexcusable to make a customer pay return shipping and a possible fee for THEIR non-working product. DO NOT BUY!!!"
3,Board is good....Darts are junk,After about 2 hours of play 4 out of the 6 darts were out of commission. The tail pieces come off way too easily and once they are off they are nearly impossible to get back in. As a matter of fact they were kind of pain to get put together in the first place. Do not buy this dartboard unless you have plenty of soft tip darts around or don't mind buying some extras.
2,Not Built Well,"This is the potty we used to get our lil guy potty trained. What I do not like is that there are two top pieces - the top (white cushion seat)and under that blue part (with the handles). They do not stick together and when my son sits, it would slide out of place - leading to ""it's broken mommy"" and not wanting to go. I ended up buying Velcro to attach the two parts, but it doesn't last long. The pee gets in there - it get's disgusting and needs to be taken apart and scrubbed several times a day - - too much work, if you ask me! Try for an all-in-one potty or one that has a solid top."
3,Pee-catcher is awful. Sticks to the butt.,"I only used the toilet seat part yet (not the bottom potty).1) The pee guard is awful. One of the major reasons we bought this was the pee guard, as the son has a hang-up about ""Don't want to go #2 on toilet because I'm afraid I'll pee on the floor"". First of all, it is EXTREMELY wide. Basically, unusable - the child immediately said it's very uncomfortable to sit with (could not bring his legs as close together as he's used to). On top of that, the design of it is bad (very flimsy where it goes into the seat, AND not easy to go in/out, and too many curves/bends/details to easily wash thoroughly). Plus, just looks like cheap junk, to top it off :)2) The seat top sticks to the child's butt VERY much. MUCH stronger than previous toilet seat tops we used.Pros include the handles - very convenient and well designed, and the quality - other than pee guard (which was very important to us) it looks/feels/works pretty well."
2,"If you have a boy, this may not be the right seat...","I'm going to have to buy a new potty seat for my little boy. The ""pee shield"" is removable and that's exactly what my little boy does -- he removes it. He's very young, so we're not officially potty training yet, but he likes to sit on it and use the bathroom before his bath. Each time, he takes the shield off. I'll be looking for a seat that has the shield molded into it, not a removable one."
5,Great seat!,"I bought 3 different seats. It was the only one he would sit on because of the soft seat. I had tried the baby bjorn and the safety first 3-stage one similar to this one. I think the padding makes a big difference. My son is only 10 months, but sits on this potty just fine and is learning to use it and what it is for. The only problem I have with it is that his feet don't touch the floor so I have to hold him on there, which is not a big deal because the others were a little like that too. Also I took off the splash guard because he kept playing with it. Didn't make a big difference when he pees in there - no splash anyway. I don't know if that's because the hole is nice and big or his butt is teeny because he's young, but I do know that the holes on the other two were small even for a 10 month old in the 25th percentile for both height and weight!"
2,Not so comfortable,My daughter is 2 years and 4 months old. This toilet doesn't seem comfortable. In fact it hurts after she seats on it for some time (soft seat crinkles and becomes rough). Would not recommend to anybody. We're switching to Baby Bjorn potty chair.
5,seats well,The soft seat potty is great for the toddler being trained. The height is perfect and the handles help balance on each side. It has worked well with our grandchildren boys and girls. Have only good to say about it.
3,My son does not use this,"I bought this potty after reading the reviews from other customers. However my son continues to only use his Saftey 1st 3-1-cushy potty which he has been using for over a year. He is now 26 mos old and it kind of outgrowing the Safety 1st one but he finds the potty hole in this one too big and does not want to use this potty. I think the hole size would work well for older kids 3 year olds or so, but then the whole potty is very low even now for my 26 mos old so it would be really low for the older toddlers. (My son is ~50% percentile in height and ~25% in weight for his age)"
3,Does what it's suppose too!,My 18 month old is not potty trained yet but is getting there.She sits on the potty and pretends to go potty but the seat is a little tall for her right now. She also uses it as a stepstool when she brushes her teeth.Con: The lid does not stay on its hinges very well. I tried to gently bend the plastic back to make it tighter but this did not work for very long. It is a small annoyance but for the price of the potty and that she so far like it is worth the small annoy factor.
2,falling apart after 6 months,"This seat was fine at first--except that my son wanted to play with the guard, so it always came off. Now, however, the lid frequently pops off its hinges when he uses it as a stepstool, and the plastic cover on the soft seat has come apart all the way around at the seam, exposing the foam. I'm glad to see from another review that we can order another seat from Graco, but am still disappointed that this did not hold up to regular use."
2,Poorly Made,"This works best as a step stool. As a potty chair it hasn't worked well with my daughter. The cushioned seat keeps coming off the chair whenever she makes the slightest movement (and we all know how much toddlers like to squirm) which has sometimes allowed the mess to get on the floor as well as my daughter. Also, it gets dirty in all the extra nooks (like under the cushion) which requires a lot more work to keep it clean."
5,Awesome Potty Trainer!,"I bought this same potty trainer 11 years ago for my first child and love it so much that I just bought one for my second child! It is the right size and it is very sturdy! And when you put the lid down, it turns into a step stool which is at perfect height and it is very sturdy and durable...not made cheaply at all! I totally recommend this toilet!"
4,Great Transition Potty,"This is a great potty for learners. Its not ""gimmicky"" with cartoons on it and it looks like a toilet, which makes it easier to eventually move on to the standard toilet. The seat portion can be removed and put on a standard toilet. Its very easy to wash and relatively portable if you ever have to go on a short trip. My only complaint is that the pee guard sometimes comes off too easily...but I think it may have been designed that way since its irrelevant for females."
2,It hurts my bum!,I bought this about a year ago and still no peeing in the potty. My boy just turned three and he is saying that it hurts his bottom. He seems eager enough to try and has the same complaint every time so I think the problem is that the seat is too large for his bum. Not having seen them together the hole on this one seems alot larger than on the Fisherprice one. So maybe not good for little bums. If only they could test them out at the store - not naked or anything just for size.
2,Egyptian Heiroglyphics,I wasn't happy with the book. It is outdated and doesn't measure up to some of the newer editions. I did get some benefit out of it but not enough to say the book was worth the price.
5,The best egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary,"Pot esser que sigui el millor diccionari escrit, pero es necessari l'altre volum...enrecordat de comprar-los junts!Com a membre de l'Institut Clos d'Egiptologia, puc garantir la seva utilitat."
3,Only half a book,"When I ordered this title, I was not made aware that it is a two volume work, of which I only ordered vol. one. So, I ended up with what amounts to half of a book. I do not fault the publisher, but I do fault Amazon. Now I will have to find the other volume and pay shipping all over again.... Poor job Amazon."
2,Beware! This work is out of date!,"This book is very, very old. There's nothing wrong with the scholarship in this book - Budge was no nut case - but about 10% of what's in here is flat wrong because it is outdated. We've learned a considerable amount since the days of Budge. Use Gardiner's Middle Egyptian Grammar, E. O. Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian, and/or Allen's grammar. Budge is still useful, but only for advanced students who know enough to know which parts are wrong. For heaven's sake, if you're just starting out, avoid this book!"
1,Sadly out of date -- save your money,"This book was out of date when it was 1st published in the 1920s. It certainly is not any better now. If you want a dictionary of Egyptian, look for Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian. Don't fool yourself into thinking Budge's work is good. He is generally scorned by professional Egyptologists, including those around when he was alive, because of his shoddy and inaccurate ""research"""
2,BORING!!!!!,"I have read several westerns by Leonard, this is the worst one I have read. Corey Bowen is trying to escape from the prison camp Five Shadows. He tries and is caught but does he give up, NO. He lives to try again. Page after page is spent talking about the escape. A girl he has seen one time, Karla Demery, likes his looks and contacts an Attorney to see if he will help him. The Attorney agrees and has a new trial set up when Bowen tries another break out. The big villian is Frank Renda who is in charge of the prison. He and his side kick will shoot you for nothing and call it an attempted excape. The book was slow, I found my self wanting to skim pages to just get it over with. If this happenes to be the first Leonard book you have read don't think they are all like this one. He does write some good westerns."
5,The Truth Straight From The Source,"The beauty and depth of this book is that it tells us about human political relations today even though it was written over 30 years ago!I also like that it is Martin Luther King in his own words (not some opportunistic interpretation of his ideas) on subjects like:Black PowerAffirmative ActionPovertyLoveIt also makes it painfully clear the Martin Luther King Jr. was far more extraordinary in his leadership than we give him credit for being today. He thought deeply, connected the dots, and put his life behind his ideals. This is a must read for anyone who hasn't already connected the dots between justice, religion and love."
5,Thought provoking any time in history,"His thoughts, words and deeds apply to any time in history. King challenges us to remember where we have been so we are more consciousabout where we are going to create our future history."
5,Great dealer and phone,"I think this is the best phone i could have found for the area i live in {fairbanks, alaska}. The seller was great with shipping, and product quality was great. I will buy from them again if i get the chance."
4,Great cord and charger organizer for travel!,"I wanted a way to organize several USB charger cords for an upcoming trip to Europe, and this organizer worked great! It held an APC battery backup and charger cords for my video player, cell phone, iPod, camera cords as well as other extras like SD cards. It does not hold very large chargers (such as a MacBook pro charger or a large notebook ""block"" charger). Regular a/c adapter plugs are a big of a squeeze, but they do fit. If you had several A/C adapters this could pose a challenge. The bag is perfect for what I wanted. As long as you are using this bag to organize lots of USB cords and only a few A/C adapters, you will be fine."
1,Built NY charger Notebook,I dont think this was worth the money I sent one back and never was refunded for itLaura J g tooo small not worth the price
3,"Too Small for Daily Use, But Great for Travel","I purchased this with the idea that my laptop power cord would fit snugly into the bag with room to zip up. No dice. This is more for cell phones, iPods, and other compact devices. The dimensions of the openings would be about 4-inches deep by 2-1/2-inches wide. So, if your items don't fit into that small of a space, this wouldn't be the charger bag for you. Sadly, I will be using this solely for travel."
2,Don't bother....,It's just too small to hold anything bigger than a cell phone charger. Laptop charger was too big. Didnt realize how much it resembles a womans purse lol If you're a man do not purchase! lol
3,Small Pockets,"I love Built NY products. I own several including a laptop case and double bottle wine holders, but this product was disappointing for me. The pockets are too small to hold my laptops charger, the small cordless mouse barely fit. I used a seam-ripper and removed the barrier between a couple of the pockets, which was an improvement, but in the end I bought a Relish Lunch Tote and it works perfect for all of my laptop accessories!! A Black laptop bag with Micro Dot 7 Tote and USB holder and I have a nice matching set. I gave the cable bag to my niece to use for her iPod and its accessories. She's very happy, so it's just what you plan to use this bag for."
4,Very good.,"I really like the style. However, I feel that the compartiments are a bit too tight.Otherwise, very good."
3,"Good, but don't put it under a whole lot of pressure","This is a good little puller, for tie rods, pitman arms, etc. However, don't put too awful much strain on it or you will snap the little arms. Its not as strong as some of the tougher ones. Then again, it doesn't cost as much either."
3,1 good and 1 bad,"I ordered 2 because with the free shipping over 25$ it was about the same price for 2 as it was 1. The first one out of the box worked once and quit, the second one has worked fine. It gets used every single day and no problems yet."
3,Good for a while,"Loved this product for 11 months, at which time it just quit working.It always worked well, and my grandson liked the automobile shape and headlights.Am returning it this week as it is under warranty"
1,Bought two and they both DOA!!! Buy something else.,"I was very happy to get two of them today, but after plugging them in neither of them worked. I could not believe it. One had the car headlights on but would not rewind, the other, just plain dead. I was pleased to find out that at least Amazon paid for the return postage.I would not recommend it for anyone. It's a roll of the dice, as some of you had no problem."
5,Kinyo UV 6145 rewinder,"FABULOUS product ! Works great....looks terrific, is fun to use, and is very quiet. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"I bought two at the same time. The first one rewound one tape, then wouldn't work again. The 2nd one works -- but not well. It doesn't always catch the gears well, and sounds like it's in a bind at times. But it sure is cute!"
1,rewinder,"I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE REWINDER I BROUGHT,IT WORKED FOR ABOUT A WEEK GOOD, THEN IT STARTED TO ACT UP. YOU HAVE TO PUY THE TAPE 3 OR 4 TIME FOR IT TO WORK, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT, IF IT DON;T LAST ANY LONGER THAN THAT IT AINT'T WORTH BUYING............."
1,Junk,"I could not find a reliable tape rewinder, so I tried this one in spite of the ridiculous design. I used it twice, then it broke. Just junk."
1,7 months and now it's dead,"After months of use, the rewinder had a hard time seating downward properly. I tried forcing it down but ended up cracking the front. Additionally, the rewinder wouldn't eject. Then one day, it just died."
1,Cute but doesn't work for long,"I had read other reviews stating that this unit was not very reliable but I purchased anyway. After less than 10 uses, it completely died. I like the shape and only wish it would have lasted."
1,Very bad...,"I hated this book. I miss the old V.C. Andrews books, sure the pattern was getting old, but at least they were interesting. This series isn't even up to the usual miniseries standard, much less the regular standard. All of the characters were boring and the ending was fake and unreal when usually at the end of the last book of a series is so sweet and/or sad that it makes me cry. Avoid this at all cost!!!!!"
1,The Andrews family has some sense...,"Look at it like this: The V.C. Andrews Trust has some sense. You know how normal books are printed in hardcover first before in softcover? Well, these books are just printed in soft cover. Hardcover books can cost quite a bit in comparison to softcovers. Think of the money we'd waste if they went the normal route! So we aren't wasting all that much money, although I could use my seven or four dollars on better things than the awful books that were spawned starting with the Wildflower series."
2,Not the best,I had trouble finishing this book. It didn't grab my attention or curiosity as other vc books have. I love the first 4 books to this series but not so much in this one...
2,lovely,"I bought the hardcover, because it was glamorous to watch. I read this book in about 3 days, and I didn't like it. There was no suspense. The ending was so stereotypical of teen rape. Although the ending did have a scary point! All of the actors, singers and dancers worke the Run WAAY!!! Shante?! Sashay?!I can't believe that the only student there, were the gals(s). Thank god, I didn't read all the 4 books, that lead up to this conclusion!"
5,A fun toy with an air many will love.,"This is my favorite of the Plasma Series 1 dragons. Tailtorn has this interesting look about her that gives me the feeling she's both unpredictable and trustworthy. Her design is what I most enjoy about her. The coloring of her scales is vibrant and unique because all of the other plasma dragons are very dark in color. Every limb on her is chisled and strong; it gives her the look of both a dinosaur and a dragon. Tailtorn is a wonderful toy and there's nothing you won't like. (except for the fact that somethimes her wings fall off, but again it's rare.)"
5,Warbirds of World War II: Air War Over Europe,"I had a good experience with this purchase , It came in a timely manner and the quality was good .Thanks again Bill"
3,"good footage, bad text","The footage is good and fairly complete. Some of it is in color.Now, regarding what is said and all the crap about ""precision bombing"",it would hardly be acceptable as WW2 propaganda.For real information, get the books ""Bomber Command"" by Max Hastings or ""Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War"" by John Ellis.Being this DVD inexpensive and 3 hrs. long, it is a rather good value for money."
2,Very cute slippers....BUT,"These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo, it's like walking on concrete. There is no arch support. I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue."
3,Not a good production,"I'm a fan of CC, but this DVD does not meet my expectations at all. It has a mediocre sound and the performance, well, he could do better."
2,Disappointing,"I have all of CC's CD's and their sound quality is excellent, I even use CC's Saling song to demo detail in High-End equipment but the sound of this DVD is extremely un-detailed and poor. Christopher deserves a better, much better sound engineer. It is a real disappointment. ! !"
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited when I saw this DVD in the store. Only one copy left, so I bought it instead of another title I wanted. The production quality is not good. The 2-channel audio track is horrible. Video quality is alright, but the camera work is also subpar. I could overlook these annoyances if it was a great performance. However, it seemed that Cross was struggling through the songs, occasionally off key, and having alot of difficulty with transitions. For me, the transitions were what made his studio work unbelievable in the early 80's. I couldn't even get through the entire concert in one sitting. For the die hard Cross fan, this DVD may be an appropriate purchase. However, for others, there are other concert DVDs that would be more enjoyable."
4,this is good stuff scott.,The interesting mix of string and sometimes accordian instrumentals in this cd are definately not what the traditional STP fan would expect from scott weiland. I find the change of pace a good one for the talanted musician. his individualistic expression in this album show his true creativity. I hope he is working on something new!
3,very interesting,"This is something only Scott Weiland could have pulled off. This album is very interesting, strange, but pretty cool. It's got some pretty hard core tracks, like ""Cool Kiss"" and ""Jimmy Was a Stimulator"", some pretty basic but good ones like ""Where's the Man"", and some weird ones, but still enjoyable, like ""The Date"". I'm glad STP got back together, but I'm glad this album came out, too, because in a way it illustrates what contributions Weiland makes to the sound of their music."
5,Scott W. Makes A Leap For The Better,Scott Weiland proves he is not just a hard rock caricature (even though i LOVE STP). He's a genius of the lyrics and it shows from Jimmy Was A Stimulator straight down to Where's the Man. The only bad song is Chateau Mars and that's not on everybody's. The best song is Lazy Divey but that also is not on everybody's. Ta!
5,"I really, really like this cd.",I don't know how to classify 12 Bar Blues. It's just.. different. My wife and the majority of my friends either don't care for it or are indifferent. I can't really tell you why I like this cd so much. It's got a combination of ingredients that leave a satisfied taste in my brain. If I were to spend the rest of my life on a deserted island this is one of the cd's I'd bring along. Thank you Scott.
5,A master piece.....,"Well, I'm not a STP die hard fan, even thought I love their music but Weiland's solo project is certainly the most weird CD I have, and it worth listenning it as much as you need to love it... Sincerly, I was struck the very first time I listenned to it, about 1 year ago maybe, and I've been listenning to it almost every night before sleeping for 6 months without getting bored of it... Songs like ""Desperation # 5"", ""Barbarella"", ""Jimmy was a stimulator"", ""Lady your roof brings me down"" and ""Mocking bird girl"" are amazing, they're really unique, no doubt about it... The sound of the whole album is tremendous, the production is awesome... Weiland's music is like something you know that you keep on discovering everyday... Sincerly, I won't try to say what kind of music ""12 Bar Blues"" is, nobody can I think... This album is a master piece, it's the kind of music you simply live with.Peace and enjoy"
1,what i this?,"The only good riffs on this album are the ones that are stolen. And as for the awful drum tracks, sounding as if they've been created on an old Casio, I can do without them. I've heard that some of these tunes were written while Weiland was still in rehab. If so, they seem to reflect his poor physical and mental states quite adequately."
1,Please make a new STP record,"Stone Temple Pilots has always been one of my favorite bands, so when this cd came out I decided to buy it. Big mistake. It's literally one of the worst cds I have ever heard. The one resonably decent song on it is #10, but that's about it. Don't waste your money, just wait till the group gets back together again and puts out a good cd."
5,A Musical Adventure,"An interesting Cd- very avant garde and experimental. I love it, but I do believe that not everyone will. It is different. Buy it if you're in to musical adventures.........."
4,I Really Don't Know What To Say...,"This album is weird. I think Scott Weiland created his own style of music. I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just not as good as STP. I'm glad they got back together but at any rate, gave it the same rating that I did Talk Show."
2,Westward ho animated DVD,This DVD is a low budget animated version of Charles Kingsley's historical novel. It would have been better if they had followed the story more closely.
5,Another Great Book,Dudley Pope does a great job of endearing his characters to us and creating action that is often surprizing. He is nautically correct and instructive. His inclusion of accurate maps makes it easier to visualize the action. The dialogue and narration are witty and informative.
4,More humanity from Marc Cohn,"Another collection of heartfelt music from Marc Cohn. I just received the CD and most of it is still sinking in, but 'Healing Hands' immediately went right to my very soul. Anyone who has ever gone through the process of healing, whether from a relationship or a dependency will find this a most beautiful anthem. May we all find those healing hands somewhere. Thank you Marc, for putting into words, exactly where I am right at this moment in my life."
3,three or four very good tracks... so far,"First impression: a bit bland, disappointing given the excellence of his debut album. After listening several more times, I'd now say that there are three very good tracks on it - healing hands, girl of mysterious sorrow, and ellis island - and I daresay the rest will grow on me, they are varied and they are written from the heart."
4,Thank God For Marc Cohn,"Marc Cohn is probably the most underated musical talent that has ever lived. After a classic 1st album and a good 2nd album Marc Cohn seemed to disapear of the face of the earth. The long anticipated ""Burning The Daze"" was not a disapointment. Cohn seemed to pick up right where he left off. His songs seem to flow together with such ease on this album, and although he can not duplicate that of his first album, songs like ""Saints Preserve Us"" and ""Ellis Island"" are worth the price of the album itself. Marc Cohen fans could ask nothing more of ""Burning The Daze"" and can only hope for a new album in the future."
2,One strange CD,"Like many others here, I find Marc's voice to sound very strange on the majority of theses songs. It's hin and lacks his trademark timbre. Most don't even sound like him. Also, the album is way overproduced and lacks the raw, live sound of the first two CDs."
1,Truly disappointing,"While waiting for my amazon.com delivery of this cd, I went back and listened to Marc Cohn's other two cd's in anticipation. The final track on Marc Cohn (the first album), True Companion, brought very real tears to my eyes and I couldn't wait to hear his new stuff. This album which has just finished on my stereo was over-produced, uninspiring, and uninteresting. What made me like Cohn in the first place was his unapologetic rough style. This studio album brings with it all the negatives of the recording industry. All the idiosyncracies that make a musician great are lacking and they are replaced with the air-brushed equivalent of soul."
3,It grows on you.,"At first I thought only the music and background music was great, and Mr. Cohn's vocals weren't so much. I thought it lacked range. But then it began to grow on me. The only reason I didn't give it four stars was because it's not my style."
2,far from being as good as the first two...,"I loved ""marc cohn"" and ""the rainy season"" witch are two strong and powerful cd's but ""burning the daze"" is really two steps under... I was desapointed when I realised that electronic drums were used on almost all songs, that marc's voice was not as warm as on the other cd's. Only few songs can remind you the good old days of marc cohn : the tracks 2, 6 and 11.conclusion: get it only if you are addicted to marc cohn's music and you look for everything from him. if you don't know his music get the others... is that clear ???"
4,"Didn't understand before, now I do.","I've been a Marc Cohn fan since the first time I heard his first album. The second album, I liked just as much especially 'Paper Walls' which reminds me of '29 Ways'. The first time I heard 'Burning Daze' I didn't understand the songs and why it sounded so .... sad. I'm now currently going through the divorce of my first (and only?) marriage and can now see a new side to the music. He deftly tells of his pains and hurts without bashing the woman he loved. I find that this sends a strong message about the man and his vast talents. I recommend this CD to any Marc Cohn fan, but listen to it with a little thought and a lot of heart."
3,Too little given the wait,"Marc Cohn's third album strikes me as his least satisfying. Unlike many other reviewers, I found ""The Rainy Season"" to be an impressive and highly listenable piece of work. By contrast, this album lacks coherence and moves from mood to mood far too rapidly.The writing is, at best, uneven. ""This is the winter of our discontent "" -- a great line to borrow -- seems forced and trite in Cohn's application. These songs, although well done as a rule, simply do not resonate with me in the way that Cohn's earlier offerings did.Given the enjoyment that I derived from Cohn's two other albums, I eagerly awaited this one. Ultimately, however, this album disappoints."
3,"Good enough to stand apart, but doesn't","I'm a big Marc Cohn fan, and guilty of singing ""Walking In Memphis"" as loud as my wife will allow when I hear it on the radio. That said, I enjoy Burning The Daze almost as much as his debut album (I'm not familiar with Rainy Season, and can make no comparison here). His voice maintains that soulful, gravely tone, and the sound of the album is similar, even fuller at times. It's a very personal recording, by all accounts, and only a Harry Nilsson cover keeps it from being autobiographical. But there is something in these songs that prevent me from fully understanding and appreciating, and it almost feels intentional, like the details have been changed just enough to throw us off his track. It's a shame, too, because there are gorgeous, inspired tracks to be heard here."
5,XM,"XM. A radio that can be used around the world. Say you live in NJ and drive to CA. Your favorite stations will still be there. THe 100 stations are universal. They are the same stations around the world. XM is static free, too, no matter what. Many of the 100 stations are commercial-free. The stations are split into genres, too. There are stations that only play one artist. There's an Eminem one, a Faith Hill one and many others. BUY IT!"
3,EHH i would read this before buying,"Umm well here is the pros and the consPros: its latex and it doesnt seem like it will rip , its looks ok in the dark actully better in the dark, it covers all your headcons: its big it fits my head but it has some dents and when i say dents i mean some of the head mask goes in out, in the picture it looks like theres that marterail that makes your eyes dark nope theres nothing jest two holes and it kinda tickles my eye and the mask does not look like the describtion"
1,Circle is Broken,After all the hype I expected a very good film starring the fantastic Angela Bettis. I am still looking. Bettis' performance while very good is wasted in this cheesy film student style movie. Shooting in digital gives the director lattitude but also allows for sloppy filming. The hype of being shot in one take is clearly wrong as there are at least two points where the film is cut. The story line is not new and the 'twist' ending is very predictable from the middle of the story. The filming looks like a bad soap opera and the writing isn't much better. Following characters walking down halls and sidewalks for long periods of time is not interesting and it was clear that the actors were struggling with it. While the plot device is not new it is always nice to see Angela Bettis doing anything. Her talents are so wasted here and I don't know why she signed on to this poor film experiment. The only circle I will complete is going back for my money.
2,"Normally a fan, but.......","I love Lyn Denison's books, but to me this one was just a retelling of Gold Fever with a little twist. Now THAT is a fun book that will give you some romance butterflies. My advice; buy Gold Fever or Dream Lover (ooh, or The Wild One, I really liked that one a lot)."
5,Joyful book,I really enjoyed this book. I have read it for a total of 5 times. It is written in a way that allows you to experience varing degrees of emotions.
2,Mr. Pic Is over Emotional,Has anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1? Mr. Big Pic sounds like he is crying at the end of every line he spits. he is so emotional. it must be from the bottom of his heart
1,Don't,"What ever you do, don't pay a dollar a page for this book. The information it contains is available several places on the web at no charge."
4,Engaging bookseller investigates murder,"In her second appearance, antiquarian bookstore owner, widow, and single mother Dido Hoare distracts herself from a London heat wave by indulging her curiosity over the death of a learned but possibly homeless customer, Tom Ashe.Ashe piques this curiosity when he disappears from the hospital Dido has taken him to after finding him unconscious on her doorstep. Reappearing to give Dido an old, possibly valuable necklace Ashe is then found dead, having appointed Dido executor of his (surprisingly substantial) estate.Dido doubts the official verdict of natural causes and her suspicions are soon buttressed by the stonewalling involvement of intelligence services - and the wartime memories of her father who once knew the man.Dido is a resourceful heroine who encounters more danger than she bargained for but remains undaunted. Macdonald writes with warmth, humor and energy."
5,Beyond Thunderdome....,"Is where these guys are gonna be. I bought this CD just cause I heard it had cow on the cover, but it's more than just a cow, it's a cow with some talent. I mean seriously, these guys have got an original sound that is going to take this world by storm. You should really take a listen..."
3,IT IS HUGE,"I purchased the item for my son's 12th birthday because he really loves airplanes,and anything have to do with airplanes. It is a huge airplane and the box it comes in is even bigger. The only setback that I observed is that I expected it to fly and not have to pay extra for a remote control and an engine, etc. which will now cost me over $500 to prepare it to fly. That is too costly in these economic times."
4,Unnamable,"This one's exciting, fast-paced and steeped in the absurd. It reminds me in many ways of Flann Obrien's The Third Policeman, but updated and hardboiled for a new generation. I'd give it five stars, but I want Sands to have something to shoot for with his next one."
4,WHAT?,"It Came From Below the Belt is vertiginous, full to the brim with unrbridled nonsense and an experience not unlike having a brain tumor that allows you only to remember animated shorts by Terry Gilliam. This book's untenable protean plot makes Seth McFarlane look like Tolstoy in comparison. I have read it twice and I can describe the plot of this book as well as I can describe that of German films I saw on the Sundance Channel at 3 am when I was in the 10th Grade. So, have you bought it yet? Have you bought it yet? How about now? Why not? It Came From Below the Belt is good absurdism, strange to the point at which it makes you question your own surroundings, uproarious and at the same time a piece of abject, bonechilling otherness. Oh, and a guy's penis turns out to be the reincarnation of Hitler and runs for high school class president. So buy it. Your brain will thank you. If it doesn't implode."
5,"Strange, to some, perhaps","But always sharp and funny--like a smiling, crying clown, wielding a machete, with flowers painted on it."
5,Beautiful buckle!,I get compliments every time I wear this buckle. The colors are bright and she's very sexy. Heavy material. Highly recommend!
5,Fantastic sounding player,"The MPIO FY200 sounds fantastic, looks great and has great battery life. With the new support forums at mpioWorld (www.mpioworld.com), things are looking even better."
4,First Hand Account of Russian History,"I decided to read ""Way of the Lancer"" after reading Boleslavski's classic acting book ""Acting the First Six Lessons"".Way of the Lancer is Boleslavski's account of when he served in the 1917 Russian war that saw Tsar Nicholas abdicate. It was published in 1932. The stories are still amazing and interesting. The book almost reads like a collection of short stories about the war. These are stories about young soldiers interacting with townspeople in ways that sometimes seem very unjust. It is a glimpse into a very different world, time period and mind-set. It is amazing to see how harsh the circumstances back in 1917 Russia were.I normally don't read books about war or politics. But since Boleslavski is a noted acting instructor, I wanted to learn more about his life. I found this book very easy to read and understand. The stories of what happened to him and his fellow comrads during the war are amazing, and still fascinating."
5,This real story reads like a novel.,"Very readable account of the revolution. It's written by a soldier who eventually managed to get out of Russia. He is neither a tsarist nor red, and thus his account is pretty neutral. Lots of hair raising adventures. I found particularly interesting the description of the decay of the Russian army between the February revolution and Bolshevik coup d'état."
5,Perfect,I can't imagine getting any easier with binding. Haven't used them long enough to know how long they will last but they are fine half a year in with minimal editing. They seem like they would be easy to wear out but my experience seems to say otherwise.The ability to cut them with scissors makes it so simple to get the size you need. And editing or reusing them is so fast and can be done tool-less if need be.These are awesome. Great idea. I'm surprised it hasn't taken preference over other binding methods.
2,Poor quality,Video and songs included were great. The quality of the audio is horrible. The point of buying a DVD is to get video with CD quality. The music was muted and flat.I returned the DVD. I am a big Thoroughgood fan but this is a waste.!!
2,Disappointed in 99,"The cd by the same name is fine, the vhs video is fine, but the dvd is flawed. CMC international should recall this dvd and re-publish it with the audio corrected. Either that or they need to supply a line amplifier with every disc. The audio is recorded about 10 to 15db below where it should be. It is the only dvd that I have come across that needs so much volume gain to bring the sound up to normal listening levels. Most all of the other reviews fault the audio. I believe that a mistake was made encoding the sound on this disc, and the publisher should correct it. Until then, I reccomend that buyers who are interested in this otherwise great concert stick with the vhs or the cd."
2,For your parents (of which I am one),"This concert recording is not as good as I expected it to be. The sound was close to awful at times as the guitar mix is muddled up with the other instruments. The sax player was very good, but again the sound is not mixed well. I got fooled (again) by the Dolby 5.1 specification on the package. Just because it says Dolby 5.1 doesn't mean that the sound was mixed right.The performance is good but the crowd is old (like me) and pretty quiet. Maybe George is getting too old for this stuff. I was looking for some vintage Destroyer footage and got George lite."
1,Really dumb,"The story seems to have been concocted around each of the principal actors' sterotypical characters...especially Hopper. There may have been a story somewhere here, but it falls way short of the mark."
3,Not a review - a question!,"What color is ""white coral""? I need a glossy white to go with subway tiles, and does this hold double-rolled paper?"
1,Not Interesting,This is the worst book I have ever read! Who writes a book with no plot? Morning Girl is not an interesting read.
4,A story of sibling rivalry and family ties,"""Morning Girl,"" by Michael Dorris, is a short novel that is told in the first person by two of its characters, Morning Girl and her brother Star Boy. The chapters alternate between these characters' two voices. The children live with their parents in an island village; their community has a pre-industrial culture.Morning Girl and her brother have the type of conflict you might expect between a sister and her sometimes annoying younger brother. This relationship is explored against the backdrop of the children's culture and the island setting. I particularly liked the character of Star Boy: he's experiencing some emotional growing pains as he yearns for respect while still engaging in some childish actions. An important theme in the book is the naming tradition of the children's culture.Dorris writes in a clear, poetic prose style that is touched by a mystical element. And don't miss the startling epilogue which pulls the whole story into focus."
2,"Confusing, but bearable.","I rated but a two star because I thought the book was confusing, and it didn't exactly have a main subject. It had detail(earning one star) and juicy words(earning the other star)though.It was also hard to understand."
4,Very well written,"Our teacher read this book to us at school. I liked it, but why is it called Morning Girl when Star Boy is also in it? Also, I like the way that the chapters rotate from Morning Girl to Star Boy."
5,Good family read aloud and discuss book,"This book does not have the traditional format, but this is a poignant story that not only presents a slice of a society right before the arrival of Columbus, but also deals with the universal themes of love within a family, loss, gratitude, growing up, self-forgiveness, relationship between siblings, between parents and their children and between parents. The language is deceptively simple and it may be easy for children to miss the story without an adult to discuss what's happening. My daughter (9) enjoyed reading this with me and it was a wonderful opportunity to discuss our values in a non-pendantic or moralistic way."
4,A Pleasing Novel,"This book was an interesting work of art, which included seeing life in an unusual format. It contained life for a girl named Moring Girl and a boy named Star Boy, and their relationship together as a family. There is a storm, and Star Boy gets close to dying, and meets his grandfather who died, his little sister who never came, and his relatives that passed away, and connected with them by skimming heaven. In the end, (I won't spoil it for you...) Morning Girl encounters Indians? Christopher Columbus? Which? Read it and interprate it for yourself........"
2,Not in good condition,"When I recieved my book, it was in terrible condition. The pages looked like it was water logged. I am dissatified with this product, and will have to go buy another one from somewhere else."
3,Helpful but short,"The Student Guild is helpful, but keep in mind that only the bulleted problems from Basic Complex Analysis are explained (only a few from each section). And the cost was a little high, expecially considering it's 135 pages."
1,Hood of Horrors!,"This movie sucked big time! B-rated actors and B-rated acting. The storylines were terrible, the special effects cheap and homemade and the actors awful. Don't waste your money on this one. This DVD belongs in the dogg house."
1,Dvd freezes up about one third of the way through the product.,"dvd starts freezing up about one third of the way through the product. The show was good, what I could see of it."
3,A Fun Horror Anthology,"My 3 stars may be seen as a bit generous, but I'm a sucker for horror anthologies. Although it's not as good or as memorable, Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror reminded me of Tales from the Hood. HoH has over-the-top gore, bizarre characters, and a fast pace throughout all three of the stories found in this anthology. But it also has some bad acting, the stories weren't as effective or scary as they could've been, and it doesn't have a ""wow"" factor, aside from the gore. What I'm trying to say is: this movie is fun and enjoyable if you have an open mind and it's definitely a time-killer.There are better horror anthologies out there (Trick R' Treat, Tales From The Hood), but this one wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. As of 8/5/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.HoH has strong violence and gore, nudity and sex."
1,Astonishingly bad,"Lower than the lowest low. Ideally, some kind of anti-star is required to properly rate this..."
5,"Fun, Funny and Gory","Overall, this movie had a bit of everything that makes a horror movie good. It was gory (to the point of being grotesque but with a touch of humor). It was funny, (a good horror movie is better when a few laughs are thrown in). Finally, it had excellent animation and with Snoop Dog playing the role of the ""Crypt Keeper,"" this movie is worth your time to have a fun, funny and gory time."
1,Stay Away!,"If you love either the book or the classic 1930's movie STAY AWAY. Either is a masterpiece as it's just a fascinating story with swashbuckling, heroism, and an honest hero. Apart from this version. I don't know or care where it's from. All you need to know is that they took ""creative license"" and now our twins are not interested in the same woman. Instead the hero is interested in an unattached woman... This ruins at least half the point of the story about being honorable even when it means foregoing something you cherish. The point of these stories is to instill honorable characteristics in the young, to me anyway. Without the honor of Rassendyll it's quite impossible. I just threw this away as soon as it became apparent they'd changed the story. Read the book (and the follow up) and watch the classic film. That's enough..."
3,rousabout,I was very disapointedwith this i thought the cooler came with the rack WRONG. YOU get the rack it'e a little weak.
2,ok,This was a gift and when it arrived I was a bit disappointed not at all what I expected and was really expensive
3,I like women,"I think that should be the title of this book (and all of the other Amado books I have read). While the story becomes interesting after a while, I get bored reading about how beautiful the women of Bahia are (although, it's true they are!). The beginning of the book is full of descriptions of old men and young beautiful women, which as a women is not only boring in such quantities, but also unappealing. It may be a little difficult for some women to laugh off, the way the author does, the social inequities of women that occurred at that time.That being said, the story does pick up after Gabriella comes into her own. After the first 1/3 of the book, I couldn't put it down - Gabriella is a great character! She'll make it worth reading Amado's sometimes borish descriptors."
4,I miss my friends in Ilheus,"I just finished Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon and already I miss my friends from Ilheus. Amado's writing is gentle and his attitude seems to be that we are all in this together. Characters are not all bad or all good. People slowly, patiently, discuss differences and wait to see what will happen. People are going to be who they are going to be and you can't much change that. In a way, he reminds me of Trollope as he is writing about the different social layers of the community and the twisting relationships in the town. I think I just start back at the beginning and read the whole book again."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"IN MY OPINOIN', THIS BOOK IS QUITE VAGUE' AS TO A COLLECTOR AS MYSELF LOOKING FOR ITEM'S ON THE GENERAL MARKET SUCH AS'' COMICS, KNIVES, RACING ITEM'S AND PRICING POCKET WATCHES'ETC ETC;;;;, IN THE CASE OF THOSE TYPE ITEM'S THIS BOOK FAIL' BIG TIME, ;HOWEVER' FOR THE OLD VET. IN THE COLLECTING FIELD, GLASSWARE,FURN,OLD OLD ITEM'S THAT IS BARELY EVER SEEN''OK''"
4,The Book Of Secrets Unlocking the Hidden Dmensions of Your life,"I found deep pleasure in reading this book. I always find that reading on his level of enlightenment brings a sense of ""Oh yeah ,I know what he's expressing or gee I have felt the same way.and always a wow! I can now look at this from a diffrent perspective. Is always a joy to spend time with his thoughts. thank you."
5,Simply Mind Blowing,"This really is a special book. I've read a lot of new age stuff, including many of Chopra's other work and this is book is absolutely amazing. It transforms you as you read it. You can almost feel your being touching other levels of consciousness as you read. I highly recommend this book for just about anyone. It doesn't use a lot of jargon. In fact, people of any spritual or scientific background would enjoy it. Meaning, even a non-new ager would get a lot out of this book, if they are open to the wonderousness of the universe at all. This is worth the investment."
2,Very disappointing - disjointed,"After reading Seven Spiritual Laws, which has become my bible, I was anxious and open to reading more texts by D. Choopra. This book was a disappointment in that it made odd and inconclusive jumps between science and his premise of his book. I had to re-read several portions simply because he asserted scientific evidence and then tried to connect it to what he thinks and it just missed some important steps.Also, a little frenetic for him. Perhaps because he wrote this shortly after his father died.Very disappointment although I am trying to slog through.I am going to go back to his very first books instead of his newer books.I had really high expectations...oh well! Ce la vie."
5,Profound and Exciting,"I'm a long-time reader of Dr. Chopra's books, but this one is truly unique. It pulls no punches, telling the whole story of how he sees spirit and the path to enlightenment. In the past Dr. Chopra has used a lot of pop metaphors to get his message across and has been lumped with motivational writers like Wayne Dyer and Tony Robbins, but in The Book of Secrets he is all spiritual, and for me that is really exciting. If you want to learn about everything from good and evil to life after death and the five illusions that create unreality, this is the book for you."
5,Excellent,I have listened to this book about three times. I think it takes that many times to really understand everything Dr. Chopra is talking about. I recently lost my father and listening to Dr. Chopra's insights into his fathers death and the secrets he learned about life was excellent. I highly recommend this book.
3,Over my head in many places,The ideas are interesting but the writing is hard to grasp. Worth checking out. I couldn't get through it. I'm a writer but my reading skills are not great due to ADD I believe. Or maybe I'm just dumb.
5,Deepak the Mystic,Once again Deepak Chopra thrills me with his enchanting words and what he says is all proven and true. Truly amazing book. I recommend it very highly!
5,Thought-provoking,"This book is a guide to losing yourself in order to find yourself. Too many people are trapped in their egos and can't see the world for the place it really is. Deepak Chopra's work is always enlightening, and this book is particularly so."
2,someone writing a college term paper,"...who is ill prepared .The first chapter sets you up for a fantastic quest , The book fails to answer its own questions. A lot of antecdotal fluff."
2,"no facts, just thoughts","I thought as a person with so many credentials, Chopra would cite all the references he made. i was disapointed he started out the book by stating that our cells ""talk"" to each other and are willing to commit ""suicide"" for the body. But he had no medical journals or valid references to back his claims. I prefer that if a book is going to state a fact, that it has the ability to back it up."
1,Who gets this stuff?,"I have read a good part of these glowing reviews and I must just be stupid or something. I really love hearing different opinions and alway hope that I will be enlightened by hearing a new view. I have listened to one of Deepak's books on CD before and was confused. I listened to this one and had to rewind and listen to ideas up to four times. I really love Deepak's voice... I love that Indian accent.... But the ideas seem to be idiotic. He makes assertions without any basis and then starts on a lot of junk science to support some of his notions. I guess that all of you DP readers are used to this Newage stuff, but it makes no sense to me. I will not waste any more money on Deepak's work. This book will probably work for you ""feel good"" believers, but if you have an ounce of logic, please look elsewhere."
1,old stuff in a new package,"The can got my attention, and it is a nice looking package, but all it is is a few episodes of Victory at Sea narrated almost word for word of the original narration, but not Leonard Graves,the original narrator. Victory at Sea is a outstanding series, so your better off getting the original series. youll get all of the original series episodes, more than twice the bang, for less than half the price. tigers of the sea is a fraud"
2,Tigers of the Sea,"It would be nice for some one who has not seen Victory At Sea, TiGers Was just a copy of Victory. Igave my copy of Tigre s of the Sea to the local libaray."
4,Calmdown,"After tour-de-force called Lore, Clannad seemed to have lost most of that old force and decided to go back to mainstream. It doesn't mean that Landmarks is bad. It's as good as Oldfield's Tubular Bells III or Enya's A Day without Rain - kind of a come-back after all the best is behind. A Mhuirninn O is a really good variation on a folk-theme: something that Clannad know the best. Of This Land is one of the best more-or-less pop stuff, although it still has much of that new age and folk sound so typical for Clannad. Golden Ball is an interesting jazz-folk instrumental, where the group really has something new to offer. Landmarks is not among the best Clannad's albums, but fans will know how to appreciate it."
4,Exceptional music,relaxing and thought provoking music that relaxes and allows an individual to reflect without being bothered by a fast beat and words.
4,Sweet Celtic and Rolling Green Hills,"That is the vision you get when listening to Clannad's LANDMARK. ""A MHUIRNIN O"" has that step dance feel while other cuts on the album give you vision of rolling green hills and misty valleys. Clannad has been around for many years and I enjoy them more and more with each album and the more I listen. They are truly talented musicians that share that spirit of Ireland. The music calls you to reflect and dream. Clannad always mixes well the old Ireland with the new Ireland."
1,Test takers beware,"The practice tests for the HSPT in this book are terrible. They are filled with typos and poorly written questions. The tests are so bad, in fact, that I think they can detrimentally effect a student's performance on the test by seriously shaking his or her confidence.Kaplan publishes an errata sheet on the Kaplan website, but even that is very far from complete. Princeton Review books are nearly as bad in the typo department, unfortunately."
3,Needs editing,There is an error in the TACHs mathematics page 12 problem answer and page 15 answer key explanation. You'd think they have editors for stuff like this. There may be more errors.
4,Thought provoking,Haven't used the book a lot but from what I have read there are a lot of open discussion points that can be brought to light in this little book.
4,Very good old school book with thorough information,"I found this title surfing the web and falled in love not only with this one but also with this editorial.As an apprentice crafstman with a love for restoring old cars, this old books have plenty of useful information on forgotten skills, many of them fundamental for doing proper restaurations.About this book, I appreciated specially the complete information about metals and their characteristics and behaviour, and also the deep information about many chemical process.Highly recommended."
5,Great Book!,This was a required book for Oklahoma University Goal Setting class. A novel! So informative and real life problems. I did love this book!
2,Superficial Drivel,Nothing new. Common sense re-packaged. Wonderful example of an author with a blinding sense of the obvious. Little applicability beyond the manufacturing environment.
1,Far from impressed.,"I didn't mind that the author chose the format he did, but as a successful business owner myself, I would be disappointed to think that even an entry level manager would find revelation in the concepts of this book. But then again, I am constantly amazed at the naivety of most people as to what it takes to make a business run successfully. I thought that The Goal, while providing a useful reiteration of common sense ideas, was, overall, written at a level for fifth graders. The book presented good ideas, but would be better suited to a high-school economics class than a CEO's library. I have found that almost all successful businesses are run by people who are born with a natural ability, and who may also have learned the necessary concepts, but never by people who learn the concepts and are born ""without"" the natural ability."
1,The book is probably really good if you are plant manager.,But oddly enough I'm not. Our economics teacher made us read this book for economics class and I found it to be totally irrevelent to anything i would have to learn in high school. And now i have to write a nomination based on the book for the Malcolm Baldridge Excellence Award. Reading this book was a complete waste of time for me.
5,an inspiring business novel,"I used to think business books and novels are of two distinct & unrelated world (and shelves) and here comes ""The Goal"" which I spent my least time to complete the book ever. Interesting and inspiring!"
5,"If you have a problem, Eli teaches you to look for solution","The book I have been waiting for and never left my side. I find this book interesting in its story telling - not fables but reality and the way we usually think. Eli, through the character, Jonah, guides you to use your deductive reasoning to solve any problem. Though this book is backgrounded in a manufacturing environment, it is applicable in any situations.Read on and you will agree with me! Welcome to a journey of enlightment."
4,A business person's book,"Our senior class wrote a theme sentence for the book. The theme is to prioritize your options by determining the goal and the correct measurements in order to balance your business and personal life and achieve ""ongoing improvement"" in both. It is a college-type book."
5,The basis for the correct way to run JIT manufacturing.,"I could not put this book down. I read it 5 years ago, since then every one of our operating staff has read it. It is facinating the way Mr. Goldratt and Mr. Cox weave the story in, around and about a manufacturing operation. If you are in manufacturing and expect to get anywhere read this book."
3,Better than average,"The first time I read the book, I found it really enjoyable as well as stimulating. Tried to relate the problems mentioned in Mr Rogo's plant with my work place. However, after the second glance of the book, some of the problems were over-simplied, especially towards the end of the book - when Stacey & Ralph found that more than twenty orders were or would be delayed ... because of the balance had been changed due to accepting more new orders. I'm sure in real life, these problems are more complicated and cannot be solved as easily as descrcibed in the book.Anyway, it did offer a new fresh look at the problems in mnaufacturing site."
4,The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement,"It is a book that my teacher required for the course, but I am sure this will benefit me to understand the Cost Accounting side."
4,"Easy read, but tends to drag at end","Straight forward & easy to follow reading. The Theory Of Constraints portion was a bit dumbed down and a the romance thread was a little tiresome, but all in all it was a decent read. The last 50 pages are a complete bore...just kept dragging along so I suggest you close the book once you think the hero has saved the town - you won't miss a thing."
