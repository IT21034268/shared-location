1,Why would they put the games name on the mouse when it's not compatable?!?!,Lately my game of choice has been 2142 and I picked up the G5 after my mates who are ALL Quake players swear up and down about it.Turns out the G5 gaming mouse is not compatable with 2142. How stupid are these guys to put a game logo on the mouse and it's not compatable with!
3,Has been done earlier... Been there... done that !,"I am sorry but these compilations seems to be stuck on several tracks over & over again. I was expecting more ""previously not released on CD"" 12inches but this its just OK.If you don't own a 12 inch compilation this is a good starter but for me is just another collection giving me 2 new songs and the rest is just ""old news"".The rating is 3 because its good but not ""wow great"".There are great tracks that is yet to be re-released on 12inch CD collections. How about to give other great 12 inches from Dead or Alive some more releases. This is the 32nd time I see the same song with Dead or Alive ""You spin me round"".BUT as I said if you want to own a 12inch compilation this one is OK... sadly but true... some of the 12inches are found on the corrensponding artist original albums on CD.I still look for Whitney Houston - ""So Emotional (Extended remix)"" on compilation CDs... will someone finally release it PLEASE !!!"
2,No bargain as far as variety of songs,"Usually on sets such as these you may not know the song by title but when you hear it you think ""oh yes!"" Not with this compilation as far as I'm concerned."
1,Dixie Carb Counters Country Biscuit Mix,"This is the absolutely worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. I have been doing low carb for a long time, so I understand that even though something is advertised as something such as a ""country biscuit"" that it wont have the same consistancy or taste that a regular biscuit would. However, this was NOTHING even resembling or tasting like a biscuit. I would definitely NOT recommend this product. Every last bit of this went into the trash, along side the money I spent to purchase it."
4,Fabulous sound for it's size.,"I am a ham operator, not a CB'er. My rigs (2 of them) are both mobile units being used as base stations. Their inboard speakers are of no value. I tried replacing them with external speakers. At first I was dissappointed. Most external speakers (inexpensive ones) give poor quality sound. I then tried this Cobra. Fantastic! This speaker is built very well, has a large speaker, and produces the best sound that I have found from any external speaker. I purchased two of them, one for each rig, and am completely satisfied."
4,Vachss first Burke,"Vachss had a clear and graphic style. He weaves an intriguing plot with characters with plenty of color, and with vague histories.In all, a very exciting and interesting book."
4,So you want to go dark and nasty,"I never want to meet this dark s.o.b. ... but I'll probably read the entire series. Nouvelle noir that reveals awful things we should be mindful of when we dip into sex and violence. Finely nuanced with a side order of urban grit and gifted, terse narrative. Thoughtfully descriptive with the shine knocked off.You think you know exactly what his car looks like. His crummy two room dump apartment, the big ass dog, Mamma at the cash register, the junk yard, the Mole the parking by the river. I tasted the fear, I smelled his damn cigarettes .. you want crime noir? You better mean it when you read this fabulous spell of dinge and danger."
4,The best of the new noir,"With a cast of unforgettable characters, this, the first of the Burke series hits you like a slap in the face. Although not the best of the series, it's a must read as an introduction to the world and the characters that Mr. Vachss has so deftly created. Not for the kids, but an incredible tour of a New York underworld that you would neither want to visit OR live in. But it's a place that makes for a riveting read"
5,"Gripping, intense - not for the faint of heart!","Vachss has fast become my all time favorite author, as evidenced by my framed autographed photo and enormous collection of his works. Flood, the first in the Burke series is an intense thriller that draws a reader directly into the action and makes them feel a connection with Burke's 'family'. After reading this, it's a sure bet you'd want to rush out for the next in this series! If you like crime novels - do NOT miss this one"
2,Vachss Flood,"Vachss stories always seem to have potential but in the end turn out to be cliched and corny. He puts an interesting mix of characters in his books however they come off as cardboard cutouts. He also has the habit of taking the safest politically correct route by making the villians Nazi pedophiles. Wow your really going out on a limb there eh Vachss? His writing has always seemed to be better suited for comics, but even those ventures turned out to be disappointments."
2,"More of a pilot of a TV series than a true novel,","Vachss seems to be more enamored with wisecracks than a substanstial plot. Much of the novel was devoted to creating an atmosphere rather than driving the storyline. In fact, the actual plot happened on the last 50 pages of the story! And mix in comic-book/TV show quality characters like a master kung-fu artist, a RuPaul like hooker, a lawyer ala Danny de Vito in The Rainmaker, among others and you have a nice prime time P.I. action-comedy series."
2,Buy a comic book instead,As unpredictable as an episode of Scooby Doo. I think he stole the plot line from a Batman comi
1,Not for my needs,The description was misleading. The book may be useful for hospital triage nurses. This is not meant for telephone or outpatient triage.
2,I'm Twitterpated,"I bought this CD hoping to hear some obscure Rockabilly so I was a bit disappointed to find out this is really a fine collection of obscure Hillbilly and Honky Tonk. Beware, if you are looking for Rockabilly you will not find it here. If it had been called ""Bayou Hillbilly Cats"" or ""Bayou Honky Tonk Cats"" I'd be inclined to give it more stars, there is nothing wrong with the music here it is simply NOT Rockabilly as the title claims."
3,"Not bad, definately not great","This book is more of an overview on how to load 3D models from files more than anything else.By overview, I do mean quite sketchy.The file formats talked about are:.obj (ASCII, poor coverage).3ds (3DS Max).md2 (Quake II).ms3d (Milkshape 3D).mdl (Half-Life).md3 (Quake III)(Note that the .obj format was not discussed correctly. The code that comes on CD is actually a very poorly done .obj loader with minimal functionality. The library known as GLM is an .obj loader that is well written and outperforms the authors code by a large margin.)The .md3 and .mdl coverage is somewhat skant of details.Overall, this book is not a definitive model format book - you can get the same information on the web for free, with much better written loaders and the likes.If you can pick this book up for under 5$ go for it, otherwise forget it."
4,Good beginners intro,"An excellent starting point for somebody that knows nothing at all about 3D models, but can only be considered a stepping stone to other books that gloss over the basics.He starts with a good intro to matrices and quaternions, followed by a good intro to modeling concepts, and then describes a few formats in detail. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into any more advanced discussion on how to put things together... i.e. how to *use* the models. A few pages are wasted explaining how to use some basic ""C"", but I've seen worse...Overall, I give it four stars because, if you know nothing of the topic, it is an excellent jump start. If you do have knowledge of the topic, then you aren't the target audience."
4,Fits Nikon D90 + 18-105mm lens,"This bag does exactly what I want it to do. It just barely fits my Nikon D90 w/18-105mm lens, with just enough room for the kit strap inside the case. I bought it to hold the D90 with the 35mm prime lens when I don't want to carry a bigger bag. With the 18-105, I'll have to be a bit more careful, since I can feel it against the bottom of the bag, but there's a bit of space between the 35mm and the bottom. Any ""entry level"" DSLR should fit without problem with a small zoom lens. The D90 would not fit with anything bigger, such as the 18-200mm zoom. The Tamrac 5683 is better padded than theLowepro Rezo TLZ 10, but only slightly larger. It's a great walkaround camera case. I rated only four stars because I haven't used it, but hope to provide an update."
3,Ladies Love Outlaws,I ordered Waylon's `Ladies Love Outlaws' CD but I received his `All American Country' CD.Both CD's have all the same songs in the same order. The cover of the CD I received is a variation of the CD cover displayed for 'All American Country' with Stars and Stripes background on Amazon.com.
4,1965---book nbr 15,"John MacDonald 7/24/1916 to 12/28/1986TRAVIS MCGEE-a knight in rusted armor.He recovers peoples missing property fora fee.No one has written a character betterthan McGee to date.This story takes place in Florida, Mexicoand LA. It is about a solid gold AZTECstatue.Very enjoyable. Amazon has all 21 McGeefor as low as 1cents.bette okc 63 retired"
3,Another Good Travis McGee yarn,McDonald's fifth McGee novel delivers all of the usual entertainment. McGee travels from Fort Lauderdale to Mexico and Los Angeles to seek the killers of an old friend. Plenty of action and self-righteous commentary. Travis McGee is thoroughly readable. A great book series that should live well beside Chandler and Stout.
3,A bit dated,"A Deadly Shade of Gold was my first John MacDonald novel. It was written in the mid - 1960's, and read like it. The dialogue, metaphors and characters were terribly dated - think Sam Spade meets Jimmy Buffet in 1965 Ft Lauderdale and you've got the picture: the chauvinism, the Hemingwayesque machismo, the budding ""youth culture"" and of course the tropical south Florida sunshine. With that said, however, the book was a remarkably entertaining read. The plot twists kept me rivited to the story line (in spite of the by-now cliched characters). The occasional diatibes against the development of south Florida and the damage to the eco-system also made for entertaining asides - as well as a haunting foreshadowing of what was to come. But I think this will be my last John MacDonald novel. For my money, Randy Wayne White's south Florida sleuth ""Doc Ford"" is better. If you enjoy John MacDonald, you are sure to love Randy Wayne White."
2,"Fails from ""IR interference"" from LCD or Plasma!","I thought that my Channel Plus 3025 was at fault when ALL of my 2133 IR targets in different rooms failed to work. But tech support said it's because of IR interference from LCD and plasma TV's. They said the target needn't be in line-of-sight with the TV for this problem to occur, just near it and they couldn't say how far away would fix this. They told me to use Xantech IR receivers instead, but I coudn't find a Xantech model with the RF in and out jacks needed.Their tech support is very good, by the way, but had lousy news.So now what.. send back the 2133's and the 3025 and start over? Or switch to CRT TV's?"
3,enjoyed,"Thought this new version would be against this new type of war fare we have, unnessary war in Iraq and back-in draft by continuing the Vets TOUR!But still enjoyed what was mentioned!"
4,"Nice concert, somewhat shoddy sound","This concert was not recorded in New Zealand. Basically, this recording is The Fall at their popiest - pretty much in the fashion of the ""Live at the BBC"" show but significantly longer. The concert is pretty nice but the sound is pretty shoddy at various occasions. There are weird fade-outs and some distortions but all in all it's a very nice CD to have. It features some of my personal favourites (""Cab It Up"", ""Bremen Nacht"")."
3,Only half useful without a power cord,"This is exactly like the docking station that comes with the Zaurus, EXCEPT is does not have a power cord. So if your docking station fell and broke, this is a good replacement. But if you want another docking station so you can sync both at home and office, you will need to get a power cord, too.The ad implies that this is a complete solution to docking at home and work (""Handy extra docking station for your home or office"") which is misleading at best, and an outright lie at worst. At the very least they should try to up-sell you on the power cord when you buy the docking station.The power cord sold by Amazon is over [money]--but you can get the travel cord elsewhere for around [money]."
4,Great Piano w/exceptions,"Great baby grand for my 2 year old, however, the seat is too small for him (and he's a tiny boy). The seat is made for looks and not for comfort. It does in a pinch when he feels the urge to ""jam"" really quick, but if he's concentrating on what he's doing he'll get one of his foam blocks to sit on instead b/c it's more comfortable. Despite that, it's a great piano. I do wish there were a few more keys and it sounded more like a real piano, but otherwise it's great."
2,very outdated...,"the video lacks a great amount of up-to-date espionage. i regret buying this video bec. it seems like it is made in the 1960-1970s... the techniques and devices used for spying and surveillance only clash with this time period. its like the game of a child, bec. their actions (the spies) are so obvious, like holding a walkietalkie or an earplug attached to them. they're not discreet, so i dont really suggest this video. its not so useful except for getting to know the different spying devices. try going for something like the 1990s or 2000s if ur gonna buy a video for espionage."
2,Not always fresh,FIRST ORDER WE RECEIVED GREAT FRESH NUTS. REODER AND GOT LOTS MORE EMPTY SHELLS AND TASTED STALE.
2,Not totally satisfied.,"They sent the wrong product. When I tried to call their customer service line, it was closed. They are apparently frequently on holiday. Got totally screwed on this deal. Won't shop with them again.(Will give credit to Oh Nuts in that, after they did finally come back from holiday, they sent me two of the item I originally ordered and refunded my money. They quality of their products is very good. Sadly, their SNAFU wasn't resolved until after my special event had already occured, but at least they tried. Might shop with them again, but will check the holiday schedule first to make sure they will be in office.)"
3,"Nuts are fine, company is terrible","I have only ordered from them once and that will be the only time. They did nothing but mess up my order both the original and the replacement. They sent me the wrong thing which was intended for a Christmas present, acted like they didn't believe me on the phone and wouldn't send a replacement until they received the wrong item back so the present was late. Then they sent the wrong item as a replacement. I ordered a 5 pound bag for a reason, 5-1 pound bags are not the same thing. It was already a month late so I went ahead and gifted it but never again. Cheapest isn't always best. I can't fault the product though, just their crappy service. It was actually regular pistachios they messed up on but I also ordered 2 bags of these and they managed to send them fine. They do have more flavor than the regular ones, not so much different as just more intense. Just find another company to get them from, item gets 5 stars company 1."
3,Mighty tight,"This item came free with the Canon point-and-shoot camera I bought. It's fine for that purpose. But it's a pretty tight fit, which barely zips over the camera. It also has some tiny accessory compartments, but once the camera is in the case, it is nearly impossible to get anything into them. Just a wee bit more room inside would have been nice."
3,Nice looking case but just too small,"I purchased this camera case for my Canon SX210IS. According the description it fits the camera. I was very happy to receive the case in a week after orderred it. When I open it, I found out that it's just too small for my camera! Otherwise, it's good."
3,A Bit Smaller Than Expected,"I bought this bag (Lowepro Ridge 10 Camera Case) for my Lumix DMC-FP2 camera. It's a little smaller than I imagined. The camera, which is fairly small itself, is too big for the bag. The velcro closure is very strong, so it cannot open easily when walking and bumping into something, and the belt loop is better than a velcro loop, hands down. Someone else mentioned the zipper on the flap opening with gravity, but if gravity was strong enough to pull the zipper down, then I'd weigh much more than I do now! The price was right, and I can use it for accessories, so it wasn't a complete bust. With that stated, the construction is excellent and the quality is very good, so it rates 4 stars to me even though my camera won't fit."
4,Good bag.,The bag itself is adequate and great given the price. My only dislikes are the shoulder strap begin to narrow and the hooks that connect the strap to the bag are made of plastic. Otherwise it serves its purpose quite well. I even have room for an extra battery as well as another compartment for a cell phone or ipod. Good for roaming the city.
5,Good product!,"We own three of the Lowepro 10 camera cases and all are working fine. Our Roofing Estimators have not destroyed any of them and all of our cameras are in good shape.Randy MayLarry Haight's Residential Roofing Company, Redmond WA."
3,Got free w my camera,Never reallly use it but it fits the camera I have. Construction seems fine but I would rather stick in a thin bag and throw in a purse or back pack.
3,Does not fit Nikon P300,"For reference this does not fit a Nikon P300. For some reason I thought it would, but learned the best thing to do is go to LowePro's site to double check inside dimensions before purchasing. TheLowepro Dublin 20is a better choice and fits quite snug."
4,Compact,"The product looks just like the picture. It is a great little camera case for a small camera. It has three compartments, one large for the camera, one medium for an extra battery, and a small pocket for extra memory cards. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I would have preferred the medium pocket to be a little bigger to hold the charger for my Canon SD1100IS. The charger barely fits into this pocket."
3,Too tight for Panasonic DMC-FH25K,"The case is nicely padded and has quite a front pocket that can hold another battery and an SD card.The main pocket is too small for the Panasonic DMC-FH25K. I can squeeze it inside, but the zipper can easily scratch the camera body while trying to close it.Bottom line: if you have a smaller camera, go for it. Otherwise, buy a slightly bigger case."
3,Camera Case,"This was a great case but too small. Hard to get the camera out quickly and also only fit the camera....no pockets for extra memory cards, charger. Couldn't use it for the camera...."
4,As advertised,"I bought this case to protect my Canon Powershot A1200 as I know the Lowepro name. If a case were available locally, I would have bought it, but I took a chance and bought it online. My camera JUST FITS inside the case - there is no room to spare. If it had a tiny bit of wiggle room, I would have rated it higher. Padding is good, strap works well and is easily adjustable. Color is bright enough to be seen if the case is stored inside another bag which makes it easy to grab. I haven't used the belt loop yet, but I'm sure I will test it, too. All in all a good deal."
1,Doesn't fit Nikon L18,"While I generally like Lowepro cases and own one for my older point-and-shoot and one for my Canon DSLR, Lowepro needs to revise their compatibility chart for the Nikon L18 (as well as the alleged measurements on the Ridge 10 product page) on their website. The L18 just doesn't fit in this case. The L18 is actually LONGER than my Canon A570 IS, which fits comfortably in the Ridge 30 (2 sizes larger than the Ridge 10!). The inside length measurements on the Ridge 10 product page are at least 0.5 inches longer than the actual inside length. I don't know how this happened but Lowepro will hear about it (especially considering they are probably providing this case-compatibility information to all of their retailers, like Circuit City, where I bought mine online and now have to send back.)"
2,Camera case snug,I liked the looks of the bag and it had been recommended as a fit for my new Canon PowerShot A3000IS 10 MP Digital Camera. Upon receipt the camera fit the main compartment but it was not easy zipping it closed. The small pocket on the front for extra battery or memory card while large enough under normal circumstance bulged significantly with anything in it. I have ended up just using the case as storage for the camera when at home.
4,Camera Case is Good,Quality and cost of Camera Case is good as per the specifications.I have received the item in time without delay.
5,Nice Little Camera Case,"The Canon PowerShot 10 camera fits nicely in this case with a pocket for flash card, battery, or cords. I recommend this item for this small camera."
3,Does not fit the Sony HX9V camera,"Not a fault of the bag, but unfortunately it was not large enough to fit the Sony HX9V camera. Too bad, because I really like the size and construction of the bag."
2,Not the same as picture,"The item shipped is not the same as the one pictured, even though it is the same model number. What was shipped is an ugly tan with green and brown memory and tax keys. Not attractive at all."
4,Calculator review,"Nice piece of equipment. I had hoped it would be a little larger, but once I received it, I found it does the job quite nicely."
3,Great Book!,"This book wasn't the best in the series, but it still was a very good book. If you don't read this book then in the third book you are totally confussed. There is a lot in this book that is VERY important. It links all their past to their present."
5,Can't wait to read #3!,"After just finishing book 1 of the series, I jumped into book 2 (The Wild One) which focuses on my personal favorite character, Isabel Evans.For those who watch the TV series, this book is like no episode the WB has ever done. In fact, this could be the perfect storyline to follow for their season finale.Another alien in Roswell? Is he the ONLY other one? Isabel Evans getting hot and heavy with someone besides Alex?If you want answers to all of this, I highly recommend this book! I can't wait to jump into the third one!"
4,Enjoyable,"Teen action, relationships, feelings, desires, self doubts all blend together to create a fast-moving and surprisingly enjoyable read. The only real difference between this and other teen novels is that some of the characters happen to be aliens--survivors of the Roswell UFO Crash, so the plot takes some unusual twists. Each main character is clearly defined, and portrayed in a believable and sympathetic manner.As a Roswell resident it is fun to pick out details that reflect the setting accurately and those that do not. I wonder if the author has ever visited Roswell.The ending is more like the beginning of the next chapter in a continuing story. The first book in the series worked better as a ""stand alone"" novel, but I don't suppose anyone reads them that way.-Lynn Michelsohn, author of Roswell, Your Travel Guide to the UFO Capital of the World!"
5,a great book for a 1 yr old,"I bought the 1st little qauck book while I was pregnant with my son. When the time came at 7 months old to start reading to him at night, I remembered I bought this book. We read it all the time. We even bought the other 2 books in the series. I had to buy extra copies because he riped them turning the pages so much to read with me. The duck caculator is great for kids to learn adding & subtraction with."
4,Critics love a tragedy,"These aren't even reviews.While I do not subscribe to all the helpful hints in this book I found its principles to be lifesaving and my doctors could not be happier. AA never worked for me. AA saved the lives of people I love however.That there is a group of people out there happy that Audrey Kishline has failed to uphold all of her ideals and failed in such a horrible way is sick. Nothing could be worse, but it is not where the story begins or ends. AA too has had its failures and deaths which resulted from those failures, but we do not point a finger at AA. AA is one very extraordinary approach, this is another approach and one path does not work for everyone. Quit being so militant and return to being human beings.If you have an opinion about the book, write it, otherwise this isn't the place for such arguments."
1,Really sad,"This book is really quite sad and poses methods that will only lead alcoholics to more intensive drinking and guilt. This, of course, was the case with the book's author, Ms. Kishline, who killed people in a drunk driving accident after writing this book! Moderate drinking simply does not work with someone who has a drinking problem. I have been sober in A.A. for 18 years now and that has worked beautifully for me and countless others. A.A. Has had more success than any program. It was beautifully devised; there are no leaders, no dues or fees, no enforced beliefs, just meetings with fellow sober alcoholics and steps 'suggested' for recovery. I hope that Kishline is one day able to enjoy the beautiful life of physical and emotional sobriety."
1,You're kidding right?,"Here is a woman who writes a book on Moderate Drinking, and then gets in a car while intoxicated (more than 3x the legal WA limit) and hits another car head on, and kills 2 people! Obviously this is not a book ANYONE should read or take seriously. It actually makes me sick, and the worst part is that her web site is still up and running. Does her site mention that she is in the middle of going to court for killing 2 people? NO! Does it mention she obviously knows nothing about ""MODERATE"" drinking... considering there is no such thing. Please don't buy this book."
1,Essientially useless,"This is a great book for: 1.) Those who really don't have a problem with booze or 2.) Those in denial about their drinking ( as was the authour who not only committed a drink driving offence on her ""programme"" but admits to years of secret intoxication ). When alcohol causes trouble it's time to grow up. I did without this appailling book. AA drove me nuts but Jack Trimpey's ""Rational Recovery"" was so simple, safe and effective. Let finally reiterate to you a point I have already made. Ms Kishline who exposes ""Moderate Drinking"" manages to KILL two people whilst on her programme by Drink Driving. Not a very good arguement huh? Her programme is simple wishful thinking. If you have not got a drink problem ""Moderate Drinking"" is unnecessary. If you're a big boozer eventually you're inhibitions will be lowered enough to binge. Simple"
1,Denial of Alcoholism,"Ms. Kishline's perspective is much the same as many problem drinkers/alcoholics. Most do not WANT to be alcoholic, and groups like Moderation Management give them the reason to drink they are looking for. Drinking alcoholically is a grave danger in society. Kishline found AA to be disagreeable, because in the state of denial, alcoholics do not want to stop drinking, and most cannot--without a spiritual power of guidance. Unfortunately for her, and for the family whose father and daughter were killed as a result of her drunken driving, her life is now unmanageable. This book does NOT propose abstinance for the chronically sick alcoholic--now we have seen the results in the author's life. The words ""moderation"" and ""management"" can hardly be associated in the same sentence with the word ""alcoholism."" Alcoholic people cannot ""manage"" their drinking or responsibly ""moderate"" the amount of alcohol they consume."
1,PLEASE TRY RATIONAL RECOVERY,"Moderation doesnt work: proof, this author, tragically caused a fatal accident and is serving time for vehicular homicide. Hey folks, take charge of your life ! Stop being a slave to your beast and you will find life to be more enjoyable WITHOUT booze! REALLY !! Read rational recovery, and make your plan..."
5,Great Product,I have an inexpensive CB: This is a perfect replacement for my 15 year old radio. Seems to duarable as I have had it since January.
2,"A better title would be ""Mediocre Portrait Painting""","The book is a disappointment. The paintings are well reproduced, but for the most part they are undistinguished, pedestrian pictures by new and [one hopes] developing artists. Not master of the genre is represented. No Kinstler, no Sanden, no David Green, no Gordon Wetmore, no Jack Beal, nobody. Sorry, there are better coffee tables books available. No John Singer Sargeants here."
4,Vampire with a heart!,"Ben Cross was great as Barnabas Collins. It's too bad that the series didn't go on with more twists and turns. Dan Curtis, if you ever read this, please, please have Dark Shadows back on the air waves!"
4,Good stuff,"Love these chocolates/candies, however the top third of chocolates in the container were slightly stale, not entirely, but definately noticeable to the taste, which is why I am giving it 4stars vs. 5."
2,short but sweet,"I ordered the 42oz. canisters for a party. We needed a certain amount so when they said 100 pieces per canister, I ordered just the right amount...however, the first canister was short by three...the second short by two, the third short by five...a total of 10 short. Why??? Not pleased. Yes the candies are good but if you say 100 pieces, makes sure you put 100 pieces in the canister. A ripoff..."
4,"Slow Start, But Worth It!","Like other reviewers, I think this is a great story. There are multiple levels to the plot--a murder mystery, a run at a basketball championship, a school project mirroring real life, a friendship tested. Even with all these elements working together, the story isn't convoluted. The start of the story, though, does drag a bit, especially compared to the fast pace of the rest of the novel. Overall a great read, though--another great one by this author!--and one that boys and girls alike would enjoy."
4,Good for mystery people,"I read the ""Perfect Shot."" Its a good book full of mysteries and sports and its main characters are Brian and Amanda. I really liked this book and I give it ****. First, I like how Elaine Marie Alphin goes into such detail in the important parts of the book. Secondly, I like how she keeps you guessing on what happens next through out the whole book. Lastly I liked how the book is related to a real-life problem that many people face. I recommend this book for anybody who enjoys mysteries or to somebody who just wants to learn about another situation that life gives us and how you can react to that situation."
5,Knock Off Delivers Genuine Entertainment,"Rhonda Pollero strikes again with her entertaining, sassy, funny ""who-dunnit"" with a reluctant sleuth like Finley Taylor who you'd just love to have as a best friend. Knock Off is a great read, a great romp through the Palm Beach legal world and an excellent reason to kick back and laugh out loud. This is five star entertainment at its best!"
2,Knock Off,"I found this series by accident and although it was different than other books I've read I went why not!Well, this book was so slow to get into I would read a few pages and put it down. A mystery doesn't usually dothat for me. Today I gave up. I think I will look for another mystery with a different author."
2,Disappointed,"""The case of Jack the Ripper finally solved in San Francisco"",is a false statement that brings disappointed to any one that knows anything about Jack the Ripper. Mr.Graysmith brings upon an absurd connection between the Ripper murders which took place five years earlier in England and the Emmanuel Baptist Church murders which happened in America. Just because the description given about Jack the Ripper matched John ""Jack"" Gibson, Mr.Graysmith draws his own conclusion that shows lack of research. There was never an investigation ever done on John Gibson or any proof of a connection. Reading this book confused me on the great mystery of Jack the Ripper and a possible killer."
4,Graysmith keeps the reader wanting more - excellent!,"Graysmith is wonderful at keeping the reader mesmorized. Each page loaded with evidence of the crime scenes and statements from witnesses that contradict themselves. The author provides an intriguing description of the birth of ""yellow journalism, dirty politics, wheeling and deeling by newspaper publishers, William Hurst and Mike and Charles De Young,(""San Francisco Examiner"" and ""Chronicle."") Anything to sell papers and be number one, even at the expense of playing judge and jury. One accused. Other players look equally suspicious. But one man has to face the mobs, dirty journalism, and judicial circus."
3,Interesting history of San Francisco,"Being from San Francisco, I loved reading about streets and places I am familiar with. The book was a good read. The Ripper link was possible, but he didn't really go into that as much as I would have liked."
4,Ignore the Jack the Ripper Subtitle,"I am a Jack the Ripper buff, and that is why I got this from the library, but I found it more interesting if I didn't think about the Jack the Ripper subplot. It is written well, and an interesting case. If you're only interested in Jack the Ripper, go elsewhere. But if you're interested in William Hearst, San Francisco in the early 20th century and well-written ""true""-crime, this is a great example."
2,"Entertaining, but too many loose ends","I have read many books dealing with the Jack the Ripper murders; however, I believe that this book does not solve the mystery. Granted, the theory that Pastor John George Gibson (who liked to be called ""Pastor Jack"") was the Ripper proved to be interesting. Who knows, maybe his roommate in England, Reverend Jesse Gibson <no relation>, did assist him in committing the murders; but, there is just not enough evidence to prove this. The author is way too optimistic in his claim that the mystery is solved.Also, I found it very frustrating to be reading about the crime and then having the story interrupted with the ""De Young vs. Hearst"" newspaper battle. I could have done without this; it added nothing to the book....**Overall: The book will give you quite a few hours of interesting reading, but it's disappointing for true Jack the Ripper history buffs**"
1,Utterly unconvincing,"Graysmith didn't even convince me that there WERE two murders at the church or that the church even existed! If a book purports to be ""true crime,"" please don't make guesses at what the thoughts of the principals might be! Refer to your sources! Use footnotes! Were there any photographs of San Francisco from at or near the time of the murders? If I can see photos of Lizzie Borden and Jack the Ripper's victims elsewhere, why do we just get illustrations (most without source citations) in this book? Evidence of this kind would make the book much more credible and convincing. I didn't pick the book up to read about the newspaper wars, either! The story of the Bell Tower would have been interesting as a novel if the secondary plot lines were abandoned. But if it's going to be written in narrative style, PLEASE tout it as fiction it is!"
2,"interesting, but has a few problems","As always, Graysmith's research is thorough, and while I don't completely believe his ""solution"" to the mystery of who Jack the Ripper was, he does present a good case for his theory.It seems, though, from reading this book, that Graysmith originally intended to write a couple of different books and merged them together into this book. A narrative about a dual murder in San Francisco's Mission district is awkwardly interrupted by a retelling of the Ripper murders and an over-long tale of two warring newspapers in the early years of The City. Had he focussed on just one of these stories, instead of trying to merge them into one book, the flow would have been greatly improved and each resulting separate book would have been much stronger."
4,Too cute!,My daughter had a few sets of the PeekaBlocks so getting some of the balls was just a given. We bought the animal ones and they are soo cute. They are just the right size to fit into her hand for rolling or -morelikely- to be tossed out of her highchair and fetched.The one of the hamster in the hamster ball is my personal favorite. And what child doesnt love balls. I dont see her outgrowing these any time soon. We do not have any of the playsets like we do for the blocks but will be getting some for her birthday:)
2,Over Rated,"I was not impressed, all my son did was look at them. Now that he's standing, he likes to throw them on the floor (as hard as he can) to hear what sounds they make. That's it. The paint on the dog has rubbed off on the inside of the ball and you can't even see the figurine anymore. Just a waste of money...."
3,"Not Quite What I Thought, BUT...","After reading numerous reviews, I anticipated this to be a much more entertaining toy than what it turned out to be. Basically these balls (at least the ones I got) don't make any real noise at all. My son seems to enjoy holding them and rolling them across the floor, but I think he would have the same experience if they were simply solid plastic balls without the animals in the middle. They are durable, and he does play with them, but I cannot say that they are anything special."
1,might as well be considered used furniture,I purchased this from another online source. After it arrived we found a damaged board. We contacted the manufacturer for a replacement part and it came. Then as we assembled it we discovered banged corners and other visible damage. After assembly it doesn't sit flat on the floor. Other problems I don't know how to describe. Of course now its too late to return it. I'll never buy another piece of Bush furniture again. Its too big of a risk.
5,Great Book,"I love this book! I like the way the book is organized. Lots of great ideas! This book is good for future and currrent teachers. You will not want to sell this book back, I didn't! Great book to have in your classroom library."
4,Content and THINKING SKILLS!,"This text is an amazing resource for both teachers and teachers in training. It details seven different models of classroom teaching in addition to containing three chapters on how to cultivate thinking skills in students. These three chapters may be the most important in the book. Cultivating thinking skills in our students will help them as they work through their entire lives. The seven models for classroom teaching supply ideas, methods, and suggestions for implementation in the classroom.I would highly recommend it to all teachers and aspiring teachers because of its applicability in the classroom. It is good for spicing up instructional methodologies and for inculcating a desire to learn in your students!"
5,A Conceptual Approach to Math +,This book is not a school 'workbook'. Math concepts are taught with art activites. Well pleased with this fresh air approach for math instruction. Useful section on teaching approaches included. Very Fine!!!
1,Where is the Connection?,"Where was the math art connection? I was extremely dissapointed with this book and wonder how it got any glowing reviews. It is preachy about teaching to the right brain with little substance for teachers to use. In addition, either the author has serious issues with administrators or I just didn't get the little sarcastic cartoons in each lesson. The ideas for making the connections were ideas I'd already seen. Last, there were no visual examples to help the reader, which I was extremely strange given the topic. I expected to see things about the Golden Ratio, proportion, and geometric relationships linked to actual artistic works. I regretted having bought this book and if I didn't live overseas would return it."
3,Descent system for office or small room.,"I purchased this micro system for my office. It is compact and has a good sound, at moderate levels, for such a small unit. The clock and timer are handy for the office. The only item of question would be sound quality when you turn the volume up, There is only 12.5 watts per channel but the spekers still distort somewhat at higher levels. Steer clear if you have a large room, but its almost perfect for a small office."
3,Channel Plus Modulator,"I am very disappointed in this product. The directions given to set the modulator frequency were very difficult to understand. Once resolved I felt satisfied that I had now set the frequency and would not have to do it again. To my regret, the first power outage, even though only for a few minutes, required setting the frequency all over again. We get frequent power outages with thunder storms and I am greatly disturbed that I must reset the frequency with every power outage. For my case the problem is ""compounded"" because the modulator is not easily accessible. If I had known about this deficiency in advance, I would not have purchased it."
1,"Poor edit, and too many ads","This magazine is filled with ""advertorial"" and is over 70% ads. The articles they do run are about their advertisers or are copies of articles from other magazines. The November issue had a reprint of a story from Midwest Living. Reprint didn't look as good either."
1,Home improvement 1-2-3,Total piece of junk. It's not worth the $4 I spent. It has even less information than the books they sell at Home Depot.
3,Boring Read,"I had to buy this as a text book for a class I took. It's not a bad book, and the examples it has are detailed, but it's really boring."
1,was great until I needed it,"The book arrived on time as promised. The book was in great shape, however the cd that comes with the book seem to be sealed but was a different version then on the front of the book. Also when I tried to install the cd program SPSS it said there was a file missing. I took notice to the back of the cd and it looked a bit rough. I almost did not need the cd until the last week of class and so I lost points off my grade. I attempted to contact the seller,but received no feedback from them. I have not spoke to Amazon, so I thought to warn people to be careful if your order required the cd programs."
5,Beautiful paintings!,These paintings are absolutely gorgeous! Someone should put them on the Internet.
2,Kindle edition horribly edited,"Wambaugh's story is great as usual, but there are so many typo's in the Kindle edition, we shouldn't even have to pay for it. It's worse than a high school edit on an old typewriter. Disgusting!!!"
5,humour with heart,"Wambaugh almost satirises his own work in this great book. Time there was a movie remake. His lumbering detective's secret fears are slowly explained to the reader, and his female partner learns to look below the surface"
3,Not my favorite Wambaugh work,"Joseph Wambaugh has taken a literary detour with The Black Marble - almost to the point where I wonder if he actually wrote it. (something not totally unknown in the world of book writing) Probably, he just went off course under the pressure to produce. I'd skip this one."
3,Pretty good light reading,I give this one three stars only because it's not up there with the great literature of our time. It's just a good read. The characters are well developed and you find yourself caring about them.The slow motion chase scene at the end was very well written. Not the kind of thing you see every day. A nice touch!
2,Dated information?,"This book is good but not great, and appears to have lots of dated information. For example, the author cites Nike, Reebok, and Adidas as the brands to look for when buying technical running shoes, but the fact is that these three companies make a lot of ""casual"" and ""retro"" shoes, many of which are mixed into their line and sold as ""technical"" shoes to the unknowing. He also seems to suggest that cotton t-shirts and sweatshirts are fine to run in; if you are seriously training for a marathon, whether it's your first or your fifth, you would be better off with advice that encourages you to wear technical running tops made of technical fabrics (coolmax, dri-fit, etc.). They are much more comfortable, breathable, and moisture-wicking, therefore leaving your body to focus on running efficiently rather than struggling to cool you off.It just seems like there's some not-so-great advice in here, which then made me wonder about the rest of the information he was presenting..."
4,A basic but complete guide to marathon training,"This is a short and easy read. It contains all the information you'll need to run your first marathon. It is geared to first timers with information on everything from what to eat, what to wear, and training schedules, but has good information for anyone who wants to run long distances. It was my bible for for four months and I used it to run my marathon in 3:58:40. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to run their first marathon."
1,Complete rip-off,"This is not a book, it's a pamphlet. For that amount of money, you would expect something more substantive. Not a lot of information, or motivation is included in the couple of pages. I much preferred the The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer, which really motivates and informs you."
2,Simple advice but may not lead you to a 4-hour marathon,There is nothing in this book that I didn't agree with except that I'm not sure that you could follow these instructions to run a 4-hour marathon. It's a straight forward book and it's simple to read. You can pound it out in less than an hour.
1,Not Very Helpful!,"I found this book to be very disappointing, and quite frankly, a waste of money. As a 5+ hour marathoner, I bought this book hoping to gain insight into how to run faster. Instead, the author basically assumes that you're already running fast enough and enough miles to run a 4 hour marathon, so he simply provides a standard training plan that would allow you to run a 4-hour marathon. Therefore, I found this book to not be very helpful!"
4,Decent book,"This isn't a book that goes into fine details about every aspect of marathon training, but it has enough to guide a runner who's already run a marathon and knows what to expect. For first-timers, I would suggest, ""The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer"" instead. But in the Four Months/Four Hour book, there's a running schedule to keep to. That's handy, as well as other general tips."
2,Read with Caution.,"Make sure to combine brains with your brawn, when working out. While there are some interesting factoids peppered throughout this little paperback, it may be too simplistic for the novice runner and result in injury. Jeff Galloway's Marathon training technique is far superior and slow and steady is definitely a more prudent (and ultimately successful) method for marathon preparation."
3,Not a book for beginner runners,I bought 2 of these books. One for me and one for my sister in law. I had been running 40 miles a week and she was more along the lines of a beginner runner. This book had her running way out of her ability the first few weeks. It was very easy and fun to read and did motivate me but is not suitable for beginners.
3,"Oprah, 4 hour....?","I bought this book from a friends suggestion for my first marathon. I thought the info was good and easy to get through. My only issue with it is the author makes you believe that Oprah ran a 4 hour marathon, which makes it seem like, if you follow the training, you can too. But a 4 hour marathon is much harder than it seems a huge goal... After running my first in 4 hours and 18 minutes and my second in 4 hours and 16 minutes, I read a little more and found out Oprah ran hers in 4:29:20. Which is good, but it is not 4 hours.I feel the real goal should be to finish the race, and then the 2nd goad should be a time... still shooting for the 4 hour, but will try another program this time around."
1,Very weak,Really more a pamphlet than a book. Not good for beginning runners; very little explanation of the topics covered. Training methods not suitable at all for beginners.
4,4 months to a 4 hour marathon,"So far I love the book. But I am only in week 8. I have done everything at the same pace or faster (including cross training).....so I am eager to see if I can actually run a 4 hour marathon at the end of May.I have a question to the author, publisher....or anyone who has read the book or who has an updated copy. On page 59, Week 14, it says to run 3 miles at a 10:40-11:10 pacel HOWEVER, I am thinking that is a misprint and it should be 23? Please post a response if you know the answer. Thanks!"
2,No content,"There really wasn't much information in this book. As an adult, you should be able to dress yourself for runs in differing weather but this was the type of information that was contained in this book. The training program with speed work is essential to lowering your marathon time which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to one. Unless you want the VERY basics of marathon training/running, I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Information is just plain wrong,"The central contention of this book is that Oprah ran her marathon in under four hours and so can you. Such a feat is incredibly inspiring, but infortunately, it is simply not true. Oprah's time in the Marine Corps Marathon was a respectable 4 hours and 29 minutes, but not sub-four. Plus Oprah had her trainer with her the entire race, pacing and encouraging her. The lesson, don't believe everthing you read.I did find the book helpful in my marathon training, but don't expect any miracles. You'll do just as well picking up a runner's magazine and reading the articles on marathon training."
3,a short run,"Kuehls offers some sage advice, but there is nothing really novel for prospective marathoners. There are other books that offer more in-depth information and insight to help runners meet their goals. If you know someone who has this, borrow it."
2,"Informational read, nothing more","It is informational, nothing more. There are some good points to the book but it is not realistic. I have run 5 marathons and the only way to get to the 4 hour and under mark is to do alot more training than what is listed in the book... period. If you are a mere mortal like myself (ie; you have a life, kids, job etc.) then you are kidding yourself if you think you can do this. I am not saying it is impossible, some people are in fact natural born runners. For those people they could read the wall street journal or daily news and run a 4 hour marathon on that training. Of course, speed work is important, tempo runs and long runs (no duh) but alot more of all of the above will get you to that goal (think 50 miles a week or so). I keep it around and thumb through it to look at goal times and get some pointers, thats all."
4,Informative and necessary for the novice.,"Fun reading and full of beneficial tips, this book enabled me to complete my first marathon (Pittsburgh, 5/2/99). Has also served as my inspiration to run a second marathon. A few mistakes in pace calculations did not detract."
3,Training Plans Typo?,"I bought the original version of this book to help me go sub 4:00 for the 2006 Chicago Marathon, and succeeded by 28 seconds. That was my 5th marathon. Since then I have done 6 more, but none as fast as that one. I lost the original book, so ordered the updated version. Big disappointment - I can't recall the excact data, but if one looks at the tempo and long runs distances for the 4:00 and 4:15 plans, they are way out of whack with the 4:30 and 4:45 plans. This was definitely not the case in the original book. I have tried to find a correction from Mr Kuehls online to no avail. Anyone with this new updated version, use the distances and repeats for the 4:30/4:45 plans, but change the target times to match those shown in the 4:00 or 4:15 plans depending on which goal you have."
2,too short.,"I am training for my first marathon and thought this book would be a good resource. It's got some good motivational stuff, but the book is just about basics; I didn't feel it had any ""meat"" so to speak. You can read it cover to cover in an hour or so, and I didn't come away with anymore information than I could find on marathon websites. Save your ten bucks and do the research on the net, buy a different book, or even better - join a marathon training group headed by a veteran marathoner. BTW, I did pick up Nancy Clark's marathon nutrition book - that is a great resource."
5,perfect book for 20-something female wannabe,"I wanted to find out the basics to training for a time-goal marathon. This book provided all the pertinent information for my attempt of a 4 hour and 30 minute marathon. I recommended it to a friend and she is going to train for a 4:45 marathon with me. One thing I also like about this book, in comparison with other running books I've looked at, is that it doesn't have a ""special"" section on ""women's running."" It treats us like we're all the same in the running world. Last I checked we all have two feet! Some of us may be faster than the guys, too. So look out!"
3,"A good, but far too brief book","4 Months to A 4 Hour Marathon is a good, but far too brief book on preparing for a marathon.While the back page of the book states that it is also for a recreational runner, the book is not truly made for beginners, as it assumes that the runners can easily 8 miles. The training regimen the book suggests is likely to be too hard for a lot of runners.While the book has a very easy to read style and has a lot of helpful hints, most readers preparing for their first marathon will find the book lacking in depth in many areas."
4,"a quick, whirlwind tour down a 26.2 miles path","this book is a very quick read, a trait that i found very refreshing after digging through a lot of big running handbooks. it includes very helpful training schedules for a 4:00, 4:15. 4:30, or 4:45 marathon. it has some major gaps due to its (lack of) length, but i think it is a good supplement to a more general running book. as for whether it works? well, ask me in january."
5,Great book for beggining marathoners!,This book makes it easy for a runner who wants to jump to the marathon level. It gives you a step by step training guide along with nutrtional tips as well.
3,A score of 2.5,"I got two good nuggets out of this: what bars to eat when running long distances, and running a half lap in 68 seconds is what a nine-minute mile feels like.I'll admit that the book has you believing you can pull this off, and I'm not sure that you can't. Obviously, many have.But at the end of the day, all you're really buying is a training plan.Ten dollars seems like a lot to pay. If you must have it, buy it used, or read it at your local library for free and THEN decide if it's a must-have."
1,Too good to be true,"NOT FOR BEGINNERS! This might be a great training program for somebody who has already run marathons and is looking for an easier way to train. However, I have been a runner for 15 years and decided to run my first marathon, and this program was totally inadequate.Unfortunately I didn't consult my experienced marathoner friends before starting this program. I learned the hard way that this program DOES NOT REQUIRE ENOUGH WEEKLY MILEAGE to run a sub 4 hour marathon. The longest run at race pace is 8 miles. The author makes it seem like it will be so easy to stretch that 8 miles at race pace into 26. I was COMPLETELY UNPREPARED for the marathon and hit the wall at 13 miles. I think somebody without a strong running base could seriously injure themselves using this program.From what I've heard Hal Higdon's program prepares you much better for the race than this book and has the necessary weekly mileage so you won't get hurt."
4,Easy to read & follow,"I am an avid runner who has completed a few marathons and half-marathons, but am not pleased with my long times. This book is very clear and to the point. Some of the information is a no-brainer for those who have run a lot, but I found it to be a good refresher on the basics. The most valuable part for me are the training schedules. The book covers training plans for 4 hour up to 5 hour marathons. I am looking forward to putting this book to the test!"
2,Ok,Too brief for a serious runner.sounded anecdotal to me - but might work for you if you like to read success stories and get motivated by them!
2,Dont waste you money,Very basic.. Not my favorite book on marathon training. Hal Higdons books are better and more informative. I wouldnt buy it.
3,Okay at the sale price,"I bought this equipment on sale for about $45 or so, and at that price, I haven't been disappointed. If I'd paid any more, I'd have been upset.The trampoline that returns the ball works well enough, but angle adjustment isn't quick and easy. I have to set an angle and be happy with that angle. If the adjustment were easier, I would get more use and more enjoyment from the returner. The returner will move across carpet a bit when I'm using it.The medicine ball had a great feel. Overall, the ball was soft and a nice size for gripping. Unfortunately, the seams were falling apart from the moment that I received the set. I tried putting a fabric cement on the seams to hold them, but the cement cracked and cut my hands. I tried knocking off the extra cement, and the seams split completely. I'm using other medicine balls with the returner now."
1,not one of Arlo's best (by a long shot),"I own the entire Arlo Guthrie catalog and this collection is at the bottom of my list of favorites. Not sure why it these songs seem so banal to me, but I strongly suggest you listen before you buy."
5,Groovy!!,"This CD should have gone platinum. Arlo has created a powerful and compelling piece of work. Moon Song, Face of Time, Mystic Journey and Under Cover of Night are haunting. When a Soldier Makes It Home is a great tribute to our sons and daughters in uniform. Rediscover Arlo...Buy this CD."
1,Verow Vanity,"It's little wonder this particular dvd has received no reviews on Amazon thus far. It's dreadful. The ""product description"" promises a story of a weekend after which the characters lives will be changed forever. Plot is simple. Verow hires a hustler to spend a weekend with him and then films their multiple sex acts. Other than a series of hand held camera close ups (many out of focus), that's it. If you want well made gay pornography, than buy it. Don't waste your time on this pretentious vanity project."
2,After just 18 months the dictionary failed.,"I have owned this dictionary for about 18 months. Used it once in a while, however, its screen started to show signs of failure not a long time ago. The Ectaco refuses to repair (I was told that they, actually, do not repair its products at all, they just replace them), and asks ~$200 to exchange it for another model which will probably last another two years... I have two Ectaco electronic dictionaries, and based on my experience, all of their products are overpriced. Their Customer Service is far from being perfect."
4,"Long, but interesting read.","This is a good book. It has a lot of good action, even though there are some sections that are rather boring. This is not the kind of book where all of the main characters stay alive until the end, although the two main characters do survive.This book keeps you reading, although it can get tiring in a few spots. By the end, I found myself just wanting to get it over with, even though that was where most of the main action was.Overall, I think that I would give this book between 3 and 4 stars if it was possible. It is a good book with faults (which few books do not have) and I would recommend this book for someone wanting a good, clean book."
3,Buy the hardcover version,We like the Bible itself but the paperback cover started curling immediately and we are very disappointed with that. My son doesn't like the Bible so much as a result.
1,Grossology? Give me a break.,"Don't buy this Bible for your son, nephew, grandson, etc. Buy a Bible that is honoring to God and His Word. The Word of God and His Gospel do not need to be done up with ""grossology"" and ways to be ""cooler."" The Gospel is about our need due to sin and the redemption accomplished in Christ Jesus, His perfect life, atoning death, and glorious resurrection. If you truly love some boy, you won't short change him with silly entertainment. Let him be cool and laugh at ""gross stuff"" if he wants, that's healthy; but don't diminish the Word of God in his sight, if you love his soul."
1,Do not buy this bible we dont need a grossoligy section.,This is not a good bible you want something that will give attentionbut also be gods word not how to be cooler in school and grossoligy DONOT BUY THIS BIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,first bible i bought my son,"My son is 11 years old. He was curious about the Bible and about Jesus. He LOVES this book. He reads it at school during his required 30 minutes of reading with the rest of his public school classmates. Yes, public middle school. I think that is terrific. He can't put it down. Thank you."
2,Print to small,I purchased this for my great nephew. I did not realize how small the print was. I pray that he is able to read it.
5,Great for the grandson in your life,Gave this to my 8 year old because he started going to Sunday School. He liked having his own Bible although I dont think he reads it much during the week.
5,Perfect for pre-teen boys,"My son is 11 and this bible is perfect for him. He hasn't put it down since it arrived. The ""Godstops"" at the bottom of some of the pages helps him to relate scripture to his own life. And the Gross! write-ups on some of the pages (like camels being fantastic spitters that can hold 21 gallons of water) give him insight on animals and things of the bible he might of otherwise missed. And how perfectly titled, ""Gross!"" It was enough to even grab MY attention! The text is descent size, the coloring is cool, and the first page of each book answers questions such as: Who wrote this book, what happens in this book, what do we learn about God in this book, when did it happen, where did it happen, and what are some stories in this book.Overall, I highly recommend this bible for boys! Thanks, Zonderkidz!"
3,more than the slim,"There are additional features in this the ""thicker sets"". dvd features for season one not in the slim include:Interviews with Chris Carter about 12 of his favorite episodes: Pilot, Deep Throat, Squeeze, Conduit, Ice, Fallen Angel, Eve, Beyond The Sea, E.B.E, Darkness Falls, Tooms and The Erlenmeyer FlaskParanormal and Alien Abduction Trivia and WeblinksCross Reference of 24 PreviewsAn all new 11-minute ""Truth About Season One"" documentary47 promotional television spotsDVD-ROM Games11 ""Behind-the-Truth"" segments from F/Xbut if you never heck out extras go with the slim versions.(some stores have marked down the thick versions to the same price as the slim)"
1,MISREPRESENTED LISTING,"This Amazon-exclusive bundle contains all 9 seasons in the original, collectible boxed set format. This is untrue. This briefcase edition does not contain the thick first release box sets. What it does contain is a booklet with vinyl pages that hold all the discs. Amazon`s listing pictures the boxed sets which is very misleading. If you want the first released thick boxed sets don`t buy this item. Also this item is not exclusively available through Amazon. It has been released outside of the U.S. and contains foreign language not English on the packaging. I hope this posting prevents other buyers from such frustration of receiving something different than what is described."
4,simple game!,"Knuckling Knights (4461) - by HABAa nice simple game for beginners, a four year old would probably be bored easily with this game. a fun, first board game."
4,Refreshing Schoneberg Concerto,"The two works included in this album are among the most unlikely of recording combinations, but here they are, under the baton of Claudio Abbado and the BPO, collaborating with Abbado's bosom friend Pollini.Abbado has recorded the Schumann Concerto with other artists (notably Maria Joao Pires) under DG. Pollini's Schumann is as different from Pires' as difference could be. Whichever way you want it, the Schumann here is a much heavier sounding piece than Pires's, as well as much more 'classical' in style.The Concerto by Schoenberg, on the other hand, is colourful and full of elan. The orchestral backing is truly wonderful, with the BPO blasting in the absolutely correct moments in full tonal glory. The piano sounds alive and alert the whole time, and the tutti and solo passages blended in exceedingly well. If you have any aversions against Schoenberg, this highly delightful piece would offer a good start in your way of appreciation of this composer's works."
4,Magic card collection,"My son loved getting this set. He already had about 100 cards, and there were only about 30 duplicates which he traded. Good value."
2,"overrated, but readable","Banks has written some great novels, Continental Drift and Affliction being two of the best, but the short story seems to be his true love, or so the author says in his rather self-aggrandizing note, ""Dancing with my Eyes Closed."" While Banks dismisses a lot of his earlier work for its youthful ""pride and rage,"" I find those two ingredients to be at the heart of his best work. The nine new stories in this collection, ironically, placed in competition with some of the old (even if edited) stories, lack the very heart and abandon of a writer on the edge. Instead, Banks seems to have eased into the comfort of an older Cheever or Updike, churning out self-conscious and self-impressed stories that are readable and well-crafted, but ultimately rather dull."
2,Dreary,"If there was a sense of humor, or even hope in Russell Banks' life, it must have been beaten out of him a long time ago, if these tales are any indication. There is a perverse yearning glamor to be found in these stories about the hard, bitter truths the characters find, or don't, almost as if the hopelessness is something to be envied. Cheever, it can be said, is often times dour and meloncholic, but at least lightens the load with transcendant prose , and a dark wit. Banks lacks even that, and this succession of dark skies, long winters, and teeth-grinding pain bearing just wears out: the writing, dare we say, even veers towards the cliche.A better written and more incisively written set of stories are needed in place of this."
2,disappointed,"I browsed this book at a local bookstore: on page 94, the authors claim that 'navajo', 'hopi', 'apache' and 'inuit' each translate literally as 'people' in those languages. Both 'Navajo' and 'Apache' are other peoples' names for the people we call Navajo and Apache - not their own - not words in their own languages at all. 'Hopi' *is* a word in the language we call Hopi, but it means something along the lines of ""well-behaved one"", its use to refer to the Hopi people is an extension of that concept, and the generic Hopi word for 'people' is unrelated to it. 'Inuit' (the plural of 'inuk') *does* mean 'people' among the Inuit, but 1 out of 4 isn't a very good track record. The authors' main point - that many peoples call their group simply 'people' - isn't wrong, and it would have been easy enough to provide accurate examples, but the sloppiness they display here - well, I didn't buy the book..."
2,Not convinced,"I'll keep it short. While I respect Elizabeth Barber's expertise when it comes to ancient fabrics, I'm not convinced by her take on ancient myths."
3,"Good information, bad presentation","Having read Elizabeth Wayland Barber's works before I really looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately I was very disappointed by it. Although the information is fascinating, the presentation is irritatingly pop-sci. The authors went overboard codifying their 'myth principles' into sound-bite names (Bumping Upstairs or the Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent) that have the opposite effect. They created a jargon that is specific only to this book, carries little or no information, and does not serve to remind the reader of the encoded meanings. Exactly the opposite of the myths the book examines.A good academic work is capable of explaining a concept once and then re-invoking it later without a lot of snappy fanfare. The book would have been just as good written in plain English without the overworked shorthand. Really too bad, because the work the authors have done is illuminating and valuable."
1,Not for notebooks/laptops!,"I purchased Coby CV-M25 Hands-Free Headset from amazon and was absolutely disappointed. Description tells how it will fit PC notebooks. We'll it does not. The jack is only 2.5mm. I had to return the item the day it arrived. Hopefully refund won't take too long.When shopping for headsets for your laptops (for the use of messengers and Skype), make sure it is 3.5mm."
3,Where are the Northwest architects??,"Works by outstanding firms from the Pacific Northwest are totally omitted. (Miller/Hull, Cutler, Olson Sundberg Kundig and Allen...anyone?) An otherwise fine book."
2,My 2 cents...,"Here are the things I like about this book:1. It uses actual financial statements from well known companies2. An ""ok"" description of how to do some research on sites (mainly cnbc.com)3. Links to a few sites I hadn't heard ofBesides those three things I think in this book Mr. Byron's writing is clunky and I found the text hard to decipher at times, I think there would be a lot of improvement if parts of the financial statements were marked so you'd get in idea of what he was mentioning (instead he'd say now look for something that is close to 300 million... yeah like that helps.) Also if there were screenshots (pictures) of the websites where he is discussing how to do something it would be easier to see.All in all, I don't plan on using this book for anything and I don't think it's worth anything to investors who've used cnbc.com before and have seen financial statements.Reed Floren"
5,Great Gift.,"Bought this for mom(Long time cooker) and she loves it. She swears its the best thing ever! Cooks everything evenly, super easy to clean!Would def recommend."
4,Stood by their product!,I had the pan for 2 years and bottom did start to peel!!! So I called Swiss Diamond and they told me I would have to send it in for a review. So I did. They did replace free of charge! So I guess it does pay to pay a little more for good frypan!Thank you Swiss Diamond for standing by your product! It feels as though few companies do this anymore!
3,"beware, may not have a lid","Although the product is shown with a lid in the picture, and a lid is mentioned in the product information and some other reviews, when I bought it the pan did NOT come with any lid. I reported it to Amazon but they did not change anything. I cannot report much on the quality because I had to send it back because the handle broke off in shipment. Buyer Beware!"
3,costs as much as a diamond,Disappointed about this pan. First use and the screw in the handle is loose.after a week of use I notice some scratches. I asked myself why I just paid a 150 bucks for a frying pan.
3,A 4 year review,"I have three of the fry pans now. Started out with the small 8"" fry pan, and was so pleased with it I purchased a good 6 months or so following. My third was the 12"" fryer. My fourth was the actual replacement of my 8"" pan. The surface on these pans seem to last just around a year. I had no problem with getting my first one replaced with a new one, so the customer service was wonderful. I actually thought we may have been at fault for the first pans surface wearing out, but after babying around this 12"" pan for a year it has done the same thing. I will attempt to get this newer pan replaced again, and will not purchase any more of these overpriced pans. I will buy a cheaper nonstick pan, and continue to use my stainless steel cookware."
2,This is a true review because it was purchased 3 years ago!,"The good first, first impression was fabulous. We loved it, kids loved it. No butter/oils necessary.The negative. Don't buy the life time warranty. It does scratch with extreme care. We don't own anything other than wood or plastic cooking tools and we see the scratches on the bottom. We haven't tried an exchange with the company but we wouldn't spend the money again...."
5,Fantastic Five,"I haven't watched 24 because I couldn't commit to the time and schedule. I had heard so many good things that I decided to get the five season package. The first weekend (9PM Sat. to 12MN Sunday) I watched all of season one. I couldn't stop myself! In one month I have viewed all 5 seasons! At least for me, this is one, DG series. For the critics, just remember: IT IS FICTION! And, GO JACK!"
5,24 - Season 1-5 excellent product,The set is excellent. Highly recommended. Price is very reasonable. You will have many hours of entertainment. Good stuff. A++
3,Not Very Loud,"A user guide was not provided. Plug this into my music device to full volume, the speaker did not amplify the volume. There is no volume control on the speaker so you are pretty much stuck."
4,"A good unit, minor issues","Ours is used because the Cobra 75WX ST CB radio has a weak speaker. Works good but the talk-back feature doesn't seem to do anything. Unit looks very sturdy. The noise cancelling feature reduces background noise but also reduces total volume, we sometimes need to turn it off for weak signals. The speaker has a black double-wire cord and a red single-wire cord, identical plugs on the end and no instructions on what to use them for. I phoned Cobra and they said the black double wire is for normal speaker use, the red can be plugged into a PA amplifier."
2,Not what I was expecting,Active Directory Cookbook is okay if you alrady have Active Directory up and running AND have problems. This wasnt what I was expecting given the reviews. This is meant to be a I can't do ... here's what to do book but it falls short in many ways. The recipe/cookbook format didn't work for me at all. I think a large IT department may find it useful to have a copy somewhere but a quick search of the Microsoft KB articles would turn up the same answers. In fact 99.5% of this book are condencsed KB articles.
4,Answers Questions,This book consistently answers questions I've been asking. How refreshing. This is a good investment for anyone who wants to go beyond the GUI.It's Mike.
5,Amazing VB scripts,"If you write scripts in ADSI and VB for your AD environment, this is a must have book for you. Extremely good resource. You can also email the author, after you purchase the book, to get an electronic copy of the scripts."
5,AD Cookbook,"This is a superb guide to administering an Active Directory environment. It is aimed at the administrator who knows the theory & now wants to get on and do the work. Practically all tasks have solutions in terms of the GUI, command line tools & scripts. It is one of the books that will always be on my desk within easy reach. Too good not to have."
3,Great I guess if you write Visual Basic...I don't,"This was just not what I expected. I was looking for an in- depth book about all the ins and outs of AD, but this book is basically a book full of VB scripts. I am not a programmer, I am a System Admin."
5,Very clear writing style,"Fabulous book, I like the recipe format. If I see the code then I understand how it works and for me that is far better than reading 30 pages of explanation. I agree with the other reviewers, five stars. His homepage is a good source of info as well, http://www.rallenhome.com/"
3,"Hmmm, lot's of pages, less content","Firstly a warning, this is the second edition and covers Windows 2003. There is a third edition that covers the newer OS. I bought this book by mistake and it's too big (postage would be too expensive) to return. So buy with care.This is a big book in terms of pages but the content is less than stellar. Don't expect to find too much on designing AD in real world situations such as integration with networking topologies and devices. Nor expect to find details on integrating AD with other Microsoft technology such as SharePoint. No this cookbook is really an administrator companion, and I think it does a pretty decent job in that but not more."
2,OK for speech,"The HPM-70 earbuds are quite poor quality compared to at least two other Sony-Ericsson models. I was surprised given their supposed original list price of $30. I looked hard for indications that they were fake, but they seem genuine, are branded Sony-Ericsson, and came in original type packaging.Sound is not that clear, and is very lacking in bass. This is not fixed by boosting the bass input.Nothing like the HPM-77 for sound quality and fit. If you want to use them for music as well as speech, get the HPM-77 which are very high quality.The built in microphone with included switch to allow receiving calls is very useful if you are listening to music when a call comes in. This feature is also in the mores expensive HPM-77."
5,Great product,[Black Color] OEM Original Sony Ericsson HPM-70 Stereo Earbud Handsfree Headset for K510a K550i K790a M600i P990i W200a W300i W580i W600 W610i W660i W710i W712a W800 W810i W880i W950i Z310a Z520a Z525a Z550a Z710i Z750i I got one with a sony ericsson phone and needed one for my other phone. This is a Sony Ericsson product and it works just as well as the other.
1,Awful!!,"Sony Ericsson OEM Original HPM-70 Black Stereo Headset for K510a K550i K790a M600i P990i W200a W300i W580i W600 W610i W660i W710i W712a W800 W810i W880i W950i Z310a Z520a Z525a Z550a Z710i Z750iIf you had to use this just to answer your calls, its fine. But its certainly not for music!!!! its so terrible... The audio quality is 2/10.I just bought it becos it said it was 'original'"
1,wow this is pointless,"Wow ok well when I saw this, I was like ok great this is exactly what i want and it came with all the parts and everything was fine. Although when I opened it, the earphones themselves are screwed up, One of the cords attaching the listening piece is longer than the cord to the other listening piece which causes even more problems because then the part where you plug it in has very little cord and you have to hold your ipod or phone close to you or it unplugs because of the length of the part that plugs it in. This normally can be adjusted on any other earphones but not on this one, If you try to adjust it, it wont budge, i tried even harder and i realized why. There is no extra cord, if you take off what looks like the adjusting piece, it just has the non-insulated red and yellow wires. This just pissed me off because it came uneven and thats just how it is and theres no way to get it back to its regular way.WHATEVER YOU DO, DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Good sound at a great price,"If you have a Sony MP3 music phone, this connection type is necessary. And these headphones, while certainly not top of the line, none the less sound very good, at least to my old ears. The price is a bargain."
2,Lost but still charged,"Hard to review an item I never received. A week past its noted delivery date and I never received it.No ""contact seller"" button, no ""track this package"" link.Don't use this seller. Your stuff disappears and package tracking data doesn't exist."
1,Broke Within a Few Months,"Ok, so yeah, the case is impossible to open and definitely takes a hammer. More importantly, I had these headphones for just a couple of months before the left earbud mysteriously shorted out. There is NO damage to the headphones or the cord and I took very good care of them. However, one day the left one simply went out. Perhaps it was an isolated incident, all I know was it was a waste of $10 since I like to hear my music in both ears. Next time I will invest the extra $10 in a pair less likely to short out."
2,"Requires exact positioning in ear, still low volume, low bass","Compared these to buds that came with the Sansa e250 MP3 player, and they're really bad: very quiet, and almost inaudible if you snug them into your ear like you'd think you should. No, these you must actually pivot them a little in your ear, else sound is totally blocked. Then compared them to some Creative buds, and the difference was even worse. The Philips are too bad to live with."
1,"waste of time, waste of money",How difficult would it be for Philips to put instructions on the package? I got so frustrated that I returned it to the store.
1,Worst headphones ever,"These are the worst headphones I have ever purchased. The packaging is terrible, the carry case deserves a hammer, and the cable is far too short.Don't waste your money!"
2,It's ok,"Sound quality is so so. Bass is ok, Treble is ok too. For anyone who had hard time to open the case. I think they are first time to see this type of earbud storage case. It's so popular in ASIA since 10 years ago. Need to pull the cord out first, then open the cap and take out two earbuds. If you try to open the cap first then you will have bid problem to pull the cord out."
2,Good At First But Gets Bad Later,"I bought this item about a month ago.I was so happy that I finally found cheap earphones that worked very wellHowever, yesterday the left side just stopped working for no reason at alland yeah i got so pissed off and I`m looking for new earphones right now"
3,Good Sounding 'Buds,"I bought the Philips SHE2650 in-ear headphones when the original buds that came with my 1st gen shuffle developed distortion. I paid $11.49 at Best Buy. I popped open the plastic case to remove the wires and listened to a couple of tunes. It was a great improvement, as expected, without the distortion. Then I read the 15 reviews here and decided to give the engineer who designed the case a second chance. I placed the ear buds in the sockets and wound the case. After experimenting with different finger placements, I was able to wind and un-wind with some degree of proficiency. I feel I got my 12 bucks worth."
3,"the case sucks, but the headphones are good","I too had trouble with it, but I figured out how to open it, and it's worth it. Just don't try to remove the buds themselves from the case first, but keep them in the top part and just pull the plug out, and, it will unwind and you'll be able to extricate the case. then, throw the case away (it sucks). the headphones themselves are very comfortable, nice and simple and streamlined, and they've got great output. and for the price, you can't beat the quality."
3,"From what I hear, it's a great deal!","For the price and the quality, these earphones are definitely worth it! I've used them for about a year now, and I can say that they're durable and the sound that comes them is completely worth the bang they give for the buck. They do, however, get uncomfortable after a while, but that's just the woe of earphones.In a nutshell:Pros1. Price2. Sound qualityCons1. Uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time2. Rubber earphone cover spins around sometimes; requires adjusting from time to time3. Metal diaphragm came loose after about 10 months, but a little glue fixed it right upI personally find these headphones to be the most comfortable, and the ones that I'm using right now. They are, however, ear buds: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EM8008/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00"
1,Protective cover fell off one of the buds and cant wear,"My pair has a black plastic cover which covers the metal band that holds the two halves of each bud together. I found that the plastic cover coming off in my ear and shortly lost one. Without the protection of the cover, the metal edges on the ring are cutting into my ears and I cant wear them at all. I dont see why the didnt glue / bond the covers to the bud???"
2,It's just not true--there's no extra bass,"I was excited to have some earbuds that might actually provide some quality bass. I've always liked the Apple earbuds (though I know I'm somewhat unique there), but my pair broke.First, the bass is the one thing missing from the sound of these earbuds. Treble and mids are fine, but there's really no bass. I went so far as to set the EQ on my iPod to ""extra bass,"" and that's pretty much where I leave it with these headphones.Second, the cord is somewhat stiff (unlike the Apple ones), which means it's always getting caught on my coat lapel and pulling out of my ear. It just doesn't bend easily enough.For those that complained about the shape--face it, every ear is different. I do think these earbuds are slightly larger than others I've had, but comfort-wise they're fine. But I prefer the Apple ones.I guess I just need to suck it up and pay the $30 for apple's, since the $10 variety is just not cutting it."
3,eh...,"with what i'd heard about philips headphones in the past, i thought this one was a slam dunk (especially with the words ""extra bass"" in the name of the product). however, i was hugely disappointed. i did a head-to-head test between these and my sony MDR-AS20J headphones with a couple of my favorite, most ""groovinest"" songs on my ipod...and these came up way short of my sony's. i was very surprised; i was rooting for these and thought for sure they'd blow my sony's away...but i was wrong. the bass was ok, but definitely shallow in comparison. i did like the design of these better -- not to mention the convenient storage case (once i figured out how the heck to use it)...but that's not the main purpose for buying headphones. if you're looking for 'phones to really groove with, i'd pass these by and keep looking."
4,Good - But NOT a software for Dig-N-Rig unit,"We bought this software hoping, but not clear, that this would be additional software for the Tonka Dig-N-Rigs game. If you are not familiar with Dig-N-Rigs, its a GREAT game that comes with a dashboard unit that mounts on your computer keyboard. You load the software and then all of the controls are on this dashboard, like the steering wheel, crane levers, key, and horn. It is a 5-star game and my 4 year old son said, after playing for a few moments that he would be playing the rest of the day and the rest of his life. We'll, just realize that Construction 2 is not a supplement to that game and you just use your mouse. Its still a good game but not near as gratifying as Dig-N-Rigs, and I hope they eventually come out with supplemental software to that game."
5,other review isn't accurate,"I haven't played this game in awhile but that other review isn't right. There isn't a news van, docks or warehouse. The game encompasses a bunch of activities. The meat of the game is the city activity where kids can tear down old buildings, dig holes, pour foundation and build a new building. Its really cool because you can customize how everything looks and there are a lot of add-ons (windows, doors, roofs, trees, bushes) that you can add to your building. I think most kids will have a lot of fun with this activity, the other activities are mostly fillers."
3,fragile,"My daughter played with this lightly for two days and loved it. Then a small plastic peg snapped off, leaving the toy useless."
2,Cat-A-Pult Kitty Flinger is not a toy,I bought this as a joke gift and the few times it worked it was funny. Not for kids by any means. But if you know someone who would enjoy flinging a very tiny plastic cat then this is the gag gift for them!
4,Flying Cats and teens,"This is a fun gag type toy best reserved for geeky teens and adults. The cats do fly a good distance, aprox 15 feet, but what happens after they land? Did not excite my 18 year old. Perhaps best left to cubicle-rats..."
2,Cute but NOT,for pets to play with -- a cat or dog could swallow one of those things with deadly results.
4,Nicktoons Racing!,Nicktoons Racing is a very good game. You get to choose a Nickolodeon character and play against 5 other ones. Get the game. It's really fun and I'm an expert at most of the laps except the cup 2 lap 1 and cup 3 lap 4.
2,Not Good Writing,"If you want to interest your child in poetry, have them read Dr. Seuss or Shel Silverstein. This poetry is unthoughtful and spat out at best. If you want to enjoy spoken word poetry, read or listen to Miguel Piñero. Start with the ""Lower East Side."""
5,Ahhhh!!!! I LOOOOOVE him!!!!,Bradley's Book is absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!! I't is full of the honest truht about practicaly everything!!!!! I recomend this book for everyone ages from ages 1 to ages 1001!!!! It is deserving of your household and is calling your name... It opens the eyes to the simple beauty of God and his creations... You should buy it!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Base wouldn't come off: Wall Mounting an issue,"The base wouldn't come off. It is integrated with the main back panel body. And the back panel wouldn't come off easily either. So if you plan to put it on a wall mount or a deck mount, then then basee will keep hanging. It's definitely not omething you want to see with wall mount monitor."
4,Worked like a charm.,We spent a week in Ireland after purchasing two of these converters. They were used in two different hotel rooms in four different cities throughout Ireland. Never a problem with either curling irons or hair dryers.
5,THIS IS A 'MUST READ' FOR ALL SENIOR HRM PRACTITIONERS!,The thrust of the book is about how the HRM function can be redefined to make it more effective. The authors explore outsourcing transactional work as a middle ground between being trapped in an administrative role or becoming strategic at the cost of abandoning these duties. The book addresses such basic questions as: How new business realities increase the demand for HR services and actions? What HR departments do to deliver value? What new business models for delivering HR will work? How to measure HR effectiveness? The authors examine a major HR business process outsourcer in action and provide case studies of four major companies that have reinvented their HR functions. We at HRconsultant.com highly recommend this book. It presents the cutting-edge in designing the HRM funtion; it points the way forward. The book is a 'must read' for all senior-level HRM practitioners and leaders.
5,Awesome Guitar,This Electric Guitar is a great value!! It has a nice sound and different modes. I suggest to beginners that you get this guitar. It has a guide and a poster with some guitar chords on it! I love this guitar pack!!!
2,"good pack for the money, but...",I had to spend the same amount of money fixing a tuning problem on the guitar and changing the strings
5,Great guitar !!!!!!!!!,"Great guitar for the money, good color,good sound and the amp.........15 watt..... AWESOME!!!"
3,"Good price, fair guitar","The guitar was a good price for the money, pretty colors, my 12 year old was very happy with it , until one of the strings broke after 1 day of owning it. Not a big deal to get another string, I think. Very fast shipping, only problem was the package was fully exposed with no box or protective covering. So when I went to pick up the guitar from the post office with my daughter, unfortunately she saw it. (So much for a Christmas surprise!) Most things I've bought on ebay or elsewhere come in a box or with private paper wrapping. I feel this seller could have packaged the item more discreetly. All in all, a nice guitar though."
2,Sprayer Defective,"The product works okay ... However, the sprayer nozzles are defective ... I am on my third bottle and they have all given out when the product is only 1/2 empty ... it just doesn't work anymore. Not sure what is wrong with them, but I keep having to switch to a different spray nozzle. Won't purchase again."
1,12 Sprays are all leaking when I receive them,What can you say when you received your spray and they spilled over the boxex from 10 sprays of 12. You feel short
5,A bible for the training of business development staff.,"I used this book in the planning of a training program for business development activities at the engineering/surveying firm, Psomas and Associates. We needed a training program for every level of staff from principals to marketing support staff. This book was amazing! It made the job sooooooo much easier! The information in this book was nothing short of inspiring and the success we are having in the program is testimony to the quality of the ideas and programs described in the book. I recommend it very, very highly!"
4,Rainmakers function better in a forest,"By thinking of Rainmakers as separate from the organization, the firm severely limits its potential and actual benefits from the rainmaker's efforts. This book is valuable for training potential rainmakers, but probably more useful in helping the firm to understand what the rainmaker is doing, why and how they can help. By focusing the energy of the firm on rainmaking, a much more powerful force will be generated to serve existing clients and encourage new business. This book provides a good basis for creating this new synergy for the firm."
3,A good tool for those in the industry,"The previous reviewer is correct. This dictionary is not about culture or background. This is a function tool for someone in the food industry. Good examples of people who might get use out of this are: A Chinese chef who goes to work in a western restaurant, a westerner who goes to work in the chinese food industry, etc... It's biggest flaw is that it does NOT also have Chinese->English translations."
3,Be aware,"I ordered this holder along with a set of 4 coasters from Thirstystone and some of the coasters don't fit in the holder. I think this is more a problem with the coasters not being uniformly cut, rather then an issue with the holder itself. Other thirstystone coasters I have seem to fit better.Just though you should be aware that it's hit or miss as to wether or not your coasters may fit. You might be better off buying a different style of holder."
1,extremely poorly made,"This thing is very poorly made. It arrived cracked and with a disgusting, badly applied finish. You'd be better off without it."
3,Meh,"This fits the coasters, alright, but it looks and feels as if it may actually be bamboo stained to look like oak, rather than real, bona-fide oak. Also, there are some spots where the stain didn't take and there's a much lighter wood (bamboo?) underneath."
4,"Cough, sounds of Freedom","The latest and supposedly last album from the D.C. band Black Eyes, is a stretch but yet not surprising work compared to their first self titled album from 2003. The change from using two basses and two (sometimes three) drums with one guitar did not make them necessarily stick to one sound but did make a very dark style of music on this band. Unlike Cough, though, which seems that they've grabbed any wind instrument they could find and put it on this record, made them a more complex sound. Do expect, however, the two infamous screeching vocals of B.E. to be present. Hard to tolerate at first listen almost, a few spins in your CD player with an open mind should make you experience some kind of enjoyment if this is your taste. For fellow Black eyes first album fans, do not anticipate the same record, just a different and unique piece of Brilliance."
1,Wamsutta?,"The pattern is actually very nice, but yuck, so scratchy. I actually looked to make sure it wasn't a knock off or something, checking the spelling of Wamsutta and everything. Not your typical Wamsutta."
5,EXCELLENT SOURCE,"The Federal Impeachment Process is described in this book. Fortunately, we have not utilized this method of removal often, so there is not a lot of precident established. While this is one of the three most authoritative sources on the subject, I wish that the author had described in greater detail some of the precidents in English law, the thinking of the framers, contrasts with state impeachment procedures, and a more thorough procedural analysis of impeachment cases brought before the House and Senate ... Next book, maybe? At any rate, this is an excellent book, one certainly worth the used price!"
4,Necessary Information for a necessary process,"This is a book for the serious political participant and observer. It is technical in its nature although fairly easy to read and comprehend. Gerhardt is straightforward in his purpose: (1) provide readers with a historical perspective on Federal impeachment processes and (2) provide readers with necessary information on just what impeachment means and how the process works. He achieves both purposes very well. Since there is at least a possibility of one Congressional house changing party control in November, and that the new party in control (Democrats) likely will call for the impeachment of George W. Bush, citizens should be well informed on what the process means and how it impacts their nation. This book is an excellent choice for becoming so informed."
1,aptly named,"Well, there is an hour and a half that I won't get back. Wish there had been a review of the movie so that I might not have wasted my time."
3,A day late and 150 dollars short!,"I ordered this item on October fifth. It arrived the day after Halloween. I think the company should have been concerned enough to contact me before it shipped, or payed extra out of their pocket to get it to me on time. It's good business. I didn't need it after Halloween."
1,Missing the point,"I don't see how overexposing a subject like sodomy between pirates has much to do with their time. Sure, that was a part of their lives, but did it really have any part in establishing the new world? The book spends too much time on discussing how the bigger, stronger pirates dominated the smalller, weakers ones until the would let them perform sodomy? Big deal!! We all knew that pirates sleep 3 to a rack!!"
1,"""Well, It COULD have happened!""","This is the most un-researched ""Academic"" book I have ever read in my life. I'm all in favor of sodomy, and have read piles of history about pirates of the carribean, so I was expecting things like, oh, historical references, captains logs, journal extracts. SOMETHING other than 215 pages that amount to ""Just because we can't find any historical evidence doesn't prove that it DIDN'T happen. Feh."
3,Dry academic read.,"Not what I expected. Too much time spent on things other than the topic suggested by the title. I bought to earn learn more about the everyday life of the pirate, sadly disappointed"
1,"Johnny Depp read this before he starred in ""Pirates of the Carribean""","If Johnny Depp read it, I thought it must be good. Great picture of Blackbeard on the cover. I don't know what I expected, (besides exciting pirate sex secrets) but it was almost impossible to read more than a page or two without slipping into a coma. I did learn 2 things: I'm disappointed in Blackbeard and I'm glad I wasn't a cabin boy. I gave up halfway through it. 2 peg legs down. I don't want to be a pirate anymore."
5,I love Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition,BRAVO!!!! All books should be like this! At one point the book made - even me - question my own sexuality. Bring back Pirates!!!!!!!!
2,possible but unlikley,"Being a expert on pirates I must remind readers and the author that fully half of all pirates were casterated before they went to sea.Also a ""anus"" chastity belt was in common use then.Pirates rarely if ever sodomized each other only the captain and his officers were allowed so enjoy sexual favors and they usually always raped big black slaves freshly captured from Africa.But otherwise the book is quite enjoyable I like the chapter on ""hot bunking"" and also the sexually charged ""whale blubber rub down"" were quite interesting.Any Pirate ships hiring?"
3,Arrogance is the new Black,"If you can get past the arrogance and bitchiness of the author, this is an okay book. Will not read her others...too crass and just downright bitchy. I know lots of people like the books which is why I was so dissapointed. Would not recommend to others unless you are already a fan, don't bother."
1,I'd rate it <0 if I could,"Let's not forget to mention obnoxious and toxic too. ""Can it be that the actress reading this audio memoir hates this woman as much as I hate listening to her read it,"" I wondered halfway through Chapter 1? ""Do I continue to listen long enough to learn if this person ever demonstrates any redeeming character traits?"" I think not. And please consider that purchasing this enables and encourages more of the same and don't do it. Check it out of the library instead if you just gotta."
1,Bitter is ME having wasted money on this crap,"I barely made it through the first chapter and put it away. Got it back out, flipped through to find something to redeem this book but nothing. [...]."
4,Fun to read,This was a great book and many people will be able to relate to the carachters on many levels. The read was fun and witty and I will be purchasing more writings from Jen Lancaster
3,"Title says it all... ""Egomaniacal, Self-Centered""","I'm really on the fence about this book... it was funny and cute at times, but at other times I really felt like the author was droning on and on about nothing important just to hear herself talk (but then again, the title did contain the words ""egomaniacal"" and ""self-centered"". I think this would be a good book to gift or let someone borrow as a hint to their own behaviors though! I can definitely think of a couple people who could use a lesson like Ms. Lancaster's."
3,Entertaining. Not a reread.,I bought this for book club. It was a fun read. But I don't foresee every reading it again.
1,"""I'm a horrible person! Isn't that FUNNY?""","I wish I could have given this zero stars. In full disclosure, I didn't read the whole book... I couldn't get through the first chapter. It's the account of a cruel, utterly self-absorbed brat who loses her job and has to stop living her life around what label is on her handbag. I did skip to the end to see if she gained any enlightenment through her experiences, but nope - she's still a terrible human being. I enjoy some fluffy ""chick-lit"" on occasion, but this isn't lighthearted or fun - it's just the egotistical babbling of an incredibly shallow person.This book is for people who think Chelsea Handler is funny."
1,...Just couldnt get into...,"I tried over and over to get into this book...but found it totally boring.....or maybe cus its the fact that i know too many ""real life"" Jens....just totally conceited and ...pathetic. I dont know...but either way, i wasted my money. I was under the impression the read was going to be similar to a Jane Green read, whose books I have no problem getting quickly into."
4,a good chick read!,the first few chapters were somewhat slow but by the end of the book i was all giggles
4,Bitter is hte New Black,Arrived in a little over a week and in very good condition.....overall very pleased with services and product.
4,don't need to like jen to like the tale,"I don't particularly like the narrator/author, but that doesn't mean I can't find this memoir hilariously funny. This is a tale of a well-to-do woman hit hard by the recession in 2001 but it rings quite real to this victim of the more recent downturn (well, I am nothing like her ""before"" self but the feelings resonate)."
5,"Truthfully honest, Gut busting laughs~","I couldn't put it down. The title caught me and I couldn't put it down. It's light and fresh, it can be a quick read SO I READ IT TWICE :) I now read her Blog daily for details of more ""Asshats"". She has also recommended other Authors books and I haven't been disappointed yet!!!JUDGE FOR YOURSELF. I loved it!!!"
5,Seriously hilarious~,"Loved this book!I started off hating the main character/author, but by the end I loved her. She really gets a dose of reality. She is completely honest in her writing and holds nothing back. This book had me laughing out loud, and her footnotes are awesome!I definitely reccomend this if you're looking for a quick funny read!"
5,BUY IT!,"Bitter is an excellent read! I couldnt put it down and read it in 2 days!! Jen Lancaster has a great way of putting her thoughts into a very conversational writing style that is highly entertaining. I caught myself laughing out-loud in the most random settings, airport, desk at work, etc."
4,Title hooked me...writing kept me,"When I purchased this book, I didn't realize it was non-fiction, I just bought it for the title. I was leary when I learned it was autobiographical from a blogger. The first few pages made me nervous - she was SO awful!! Then as I got into it, I loved it! She openly admits she was THAT bad and that's refreshing. The book is funny, well-written and even educational if you're a stay at home mom in the 'burbs.I'm also enjoying her blog - double treat!Not brain surgery, but a great, laugh out loud funny, easy read!"
5,"the most amusing, blithe, capricious, riotous, risible, waggish, whimsical, etc. book","I absolutely loved this book! Jen is hysterical, her stories crack me up, Her sarcastic voice and thoughts are what the rest of us are thinking but are afraid to say. Jen say's them this book rocks! I can't wait for the next book!"
2,"2.5 stars, good, entertaining at times, quick read","I find it interesting that people either LOVED this book or HATED it. I find it to be just fine. I think some of you expect too much from a book, and some of you are easy on the author. If you're looking for a mindless, easy, quick read (perfect for a flight), then this is a good one. It's sometimes funny, sometimes heartwarming, and sometimes makes you roll your eyes back in your head and put it down because the author can be a bit offensive and stubborn and frustrating and just small...but she admits to all of this. So no harm, no foul."
4,Bitter is sooo my color too!,Picked up this book basically because I thought the title was great. Little did I know I would not put it down for 2 days. It was so hilarious! I am anxiously waiting for the next book!
4,I didn't want to like it...,"This book really turned me off at first, and I was definitely waiting for her comeuppance, but she is so hysterical, and I love her relationship with Fletch (who deserves to be canonized for putting up with her). She does have her moments of self awareness, but it took her a while, as it does in real life. Jen, it really IS all about you. She really is a bitch with a heart."
4,Enjoyable,This was a funny book to read. It is hard to imagine people really are as shallow as Jen was when the book began. Thankfully she has come back down to the real world! I'll pass this book onto a friend.
2,not my kind of book,"This book was very shallow, and I did not enjoy it - in fact for the first time in many years, I did not even finish it."
2,You either like her or you don't,"and I didn't. It seems as if all the other characters in her life were easier to like than Ms. Lancaster herself. The situations are entertaining and the book is an easy read, but unfortunatley Jen's real life persona is annoying and self-centered at most. Her bitchy, catty attitude made her book unenjoyable and reminded you of the bully girl in high school. And the way she writes? With so many broken thoughts? Make this book? A definate no."
2,Bitter Needs Some More Lively Color,"Throughout the first 200 pages I despised the author, but the whole time I assume I was suppose to hate her. However, it didn't ever get much better after that even though she toned down the obnoxiousness a few degrees. Upon conclusion, I felt that her story wasn't that interesting to put into a 400 page memoir. I can empathize to a degree with the difficulties in being laid off and trying to find work that will pay at her previous level. I do think she is a hard worker and am certain it was a horrible situation. However, most of the book talks about her behavior in reference to being laid off and I think she tried too hard to make herself seem funny and cute. I actually found her to be quite boring and fake (despite the fact that she constantly told stories of how NOT boring she is in life). Also footnotes in a memoir only discussing your opinion is irritating."
4,Loved it,"I had not heard of the website, but bought the book and think it is HILARIOUS! I'm telling all my friends to read the blog and to buy the book."
1,Sorry I spent my money and time on this book.,"I feel guilty for spending money on an book authored by someone who finds humor in calling people retards. How can anyone be so devoid of empathy? Joking about people with cognitive challenges is just a step below people who use the ""N"" word. How can anyone find this funny?"
1,This Was Funny?,"I alternate my reading between fiction, non-fiction, travel, politics, humor and my hobbies (sailing and scuba). I rarely say that a book has nothing to offer, even if I disagree with a non-fiction position for example. Skip this book ... it has nothing to offer a reader looking for funny, life experieinces or creative insight. I can't remember having read a book this pointless in the last 15 or so years.(Jan 2013 - re-review) So, I picked this up again to see if maybe I was having a bad year and my review was unfair: it's not. I feel bad that someone actually is going to profit off of my book purchase. The conclusion I reached when I re-read the book is this: Trying to be funny in pointing out the disparity between wealthy and poor is possible, and I actually enjoy it. Think David Sadaris or Dave Barry. Those two authors use clever, creative writing, which is unfortunately missing from this book."
1,How was this a best seller?,"The author is self conscious and the book reads like a bully looking for affirmation. Dont waste your money, time, or energy on this book. Save the trees too etc."
5,HILARIOUS!!!,"What a fun read! I laughed until my face and stomach muscles were so tight that they ached! This is a witty, hilarious, delightful piece of work! This will appeal to anyone with a sense of humor!! A must read for those who love to laugh and and love life!"
5,FABULOUS READ!!,"This book was passed on to my from a friend, who said it was great. She was so right!! This is definitely one of my top favorite books. The biting sarcasm of the book make it a fabulous, hilarious read. This book left me wanting more- luckily, the author has a website of blogs so you can continue to keep up with the life of Jen Lancaster."
3,Lancaster is hysterical!,"Losing a job is terrifying and reading about it probably doesn't sound like much fun either. However, Lancaster seems to be able to turn anything into a hysterical, fun-filled ride. That's not to imply that Lancaster is flippant about her situation (though she is a tiny bit). Lancaster details quite honestly her life before and after the economic downturn and is very precise about the conditions and situations in which she and her husband find themselves. But she also manages to find the humor in their situations, like taking her Prada purse to the unemployment office.Lancaster comes off as a little obnoxious in the beginning of this book, but I think that is important to the person she becomes through her financial trials. I really enjoyed this book and, like Lancaster's other works, highly recommend it."
1,stunningly bad reading,I thought this might be funny because I enjoy books by women that are touted as humorous chick lit - but this book is not only not funny - the writing is so cliched and forced that I had to stop reading about halfway through. It is so rare that I don't finish a book because I have never been a quiter and I can count the books on one hand that have gone in the trash and this is one of them. Stick with Crusie or Kinsella who have it all over this wannabe writer. Sorry but the truth must be told. Not sure how a publisher picked this book up as it appears to be a debut - must have been desperate or blind.
1,Meh,I think the author is just a bitch. Not an entertaining bitch. Haven't even finished the book because it was so uninteresting.
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book because it was listed in Amazon's section of other books purchased by people who purchased books by Laurie Notaro (a truly funny chick lit author). I found my way to Notaro's books in a similar search for what people who read Sedaris purchased.At the start of the book I thought the main character was a caricature who was mostly oblivious but still in on the joke with the readers. When I realized that the book is truly a memoir and I figured out that the author's picture is in fact a picture of herself from her wedding day as described in the book, it just made me feel sad. Going through life on a daily basis with that much disdain and dislike for those around you would be miserable.Had I been expecting that, rather than what I had hoped would be a funny riff on a stereotype, I may have been better prepared to enjoy it or likely not have read it at all."
5,Too good to put down!,Jen Lancaster is toooo funny!! This book was great! I stayed up all hours of the night reading it in a 3 days.
5,Loved it!!!,I just finished reading this book and it is so funny. Jen Lancaster hits the nail on the head with what she writes. I plan on reading her next book as soon as I can. I think this is a book that anyone could read and like.
5,laugh out loud,"You don't have to be into fashion or corporate america to enjoy this book. Jen Lancaster is hilarious and witty, and pulls you into her world from the first chapter. I laughed out loud and really enjoyed her use of footnotes to add extra context!"
5,Fabulous!,I read this book a while after it came out and I've never laughed so hard in my life! I've read everything else that Jen Lancaster has written since and I love them all! She's one of my favorite authors :)
5,YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK NOW..RUN,"Seriously hven't been this obsessed about a writer since Laurie Notaro. This book isn't just hilarious, it's SMART, SWEET, Hard-to-put-down (impossible, really) and you cant help but fall in love with this girl! it's not your typical wanna-be-funny memoir, it is fresh and different and anyone who's ever been a snot in their life and can still laugh at themselves will LOVE it!"
3,Mildly Amusing,"I find the ""real life"" moments in this book mildly amusing. Once you get past the abrasive and self-centered nature of Jenny you'll find yourself waiting to see how she'll embarrass herself next."
1,Less about this book but prompted me to ask the question,"Anyone can call themselves an actor, right? I mean since 99% of actors are unemployed, why can't anyone just say they are an actor? They will be lumped in with the rest of the unemployed actors. No need to show talent. No arbiter of talent.I felt the same way about this book. I was given this book(apparently no one actually purchases this book as everyone writing reviews seems to have been given the book)and upon reflection asked the same question about authors. Does being published make you a writer? To me, Bitter Is The New Black is proof that being published does not make you a writer. Having a blog does not make you a writer. Saying you are a writer does not make you a writer. Sadly, the author is not a writer. I hope the ""New Black"" is inheritance for this lady. Do not waste your time when someone tries to pawn off their book to you."
1,Awful Condition,"I bought this used book under the impression that it was in ""Very Good"" condition. The book arrived and it is ripped, dirty and in no-where-near ""Very Good"" condition."
1,The life of an author,"I remember reading the absolutely horrific review Publisher's Weekly gave BITTER IS THE NEW BLACK and thinking ""Please if there is a God don't subject any other author to such embarrassment"". Then I read the book and found it atrociously written. I pondered, why should I write a negative review about it? Didn't my family teach me if I didn't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all? Is there a greater purpose for opining about the poor sentence structure, the disjointed storytelling, the endless bantering of self importance?No, a true gentleman would just let it go."
2,"Repetitive, This Has Been Done","It's been done ladies. If you are writing a chick lit book, please stop relying on italics for emphasis. It's lousy writing. Anyway, Jen loses her job. Is incredibly superficial. Then gains perspective and gratitude. Name dropping, lable dropping, discussion of roots, discussion of values. She then must provide a fairy-tale ending of getting a job and a book contract. Boring."
1,Would not want to be her friend,"I really thought I would like this book, initially I thought it was witty and clever. It is good vacation book, easy and mindless, but really by the end I just felt like I had wasted my time. I am just glad I am not friends with ""Jen,"" what a piece of work."
1,"She is nothing but a money hungry, spoiled .....you know what!",I thought that this book was awful. Jen is nothing but all about herself. Through out the whole book all she talked about was how she needed a job to buy more stuff. She should have been grateful that she still had a roof over her head instead of worrying about how she can buy herself a new pair of shoes. I am sorry that I even wasted the money on this book. I read it with my book club and not one person thought it was good. I do not recommend buying this book if you feel you must read it go to the library!!!!!!
4,Funny and inspirational,"I really enjoyed this book. It was entertaining and thought-provoking. A good, fun read, that will also force you to think."
1,Very slow train wreck,"Just like Forrest Gump said ""stupid is as stupid does"", and this book has the examples - from beginning to end. She not only burnt her bridges to any and all past employers, she added gas and flame throwers to make sure those bridges were fried to a crisp. It was like watching a verrrry sloooow train wreck from the time she was fired (if she was just laid off - she would have been re-hired by her former company when they were hiring again) through her long unemployment. The title is all you need to read - the rest of the book is just more of the same. It's a good read for those contemplating employment as to what not to do if you want to stay employed, or if laid off, what steps to take to not get re-employed. Some parts of the book were an actual three star rating, some parts just didn't need to be in the book at all - so I would have averaged the score to a 1.5 star rating if I could. Not worth reading."
4,Bittersweet,"I listened to an audio version of this book, so I'm not sure if that has any effect (positive or negative) on my impression.I found the book to be hilarious. Jen's character is part bitter, part go-getter, part shopaholic. True, I agree that this book isnt award worthy and isnt what I would ever consider 'classic literature', but its not suppossed to be. It was extremely entertaining and chick lit at its best. Most people that gave this book poor reviews commented on how bitchy Jen is, but why? Thats the POINT of the story. In the title, she tells us she's self centerd, egomaniacal and condescending. I laughed out lot a various points throughout the book. I also found myself envious of her purses, shoes, clothes - and hell - even the job she loses in the very beginning.I'm a new fan of Jen Lancaster and am currently downloading Pretty in Plaid.Look at this book as a light, entertaining read and you will not be disappointed!"
5,Fantastic,I loved this book. Jen's sense of humor and honest writing made this book so amazing. I can't imagine anyone not loving this book. I am making everyone I know read it.
1,"If you're looking for witty, look elsewhere.","I am honestly mystified by the popularity of this book and, in particular, by reviews that describe it as ""witty"" or ""clever."" It was recommended to me by a friend, and I resolutely plowed my way through the first three chapters without coming across a single witty, clever, or even original turn of phrase. Rudeness, selfishness, and egomania can indeed be witty and clever, but they are not necessarily so. Ms. Lancaster has apparently not grasped this crucial distinction. Her particular rudeness, selfishness, and egomania is tired and dull. Who could possibly find a woman describing someone as ""my gay best friend"" witty and clever? Sorority girls have been doing it every day for years.There are many funny and well-written memoirs out there, most of them authored by people who have actually done something worth publishing a book about. This is not one of them."
1,Entitled much?,"I have no idea how this book got published other than the possibility of Ms. Lancaster having connections within the industry.It is never a good idea to write a memoir when the main character is wholly unlikeable. One example: Ms. Lancaster sneers at people who are on welfare, and then goes on welfare...so she can buy designer shoes. That pretty much sums up her attitude about life and herself. Her sense of entitlement is positively staggering. Blah."
1,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a funny read with this one... there wasn't one part where I laughed out loud. Jen comes across as spoiled and ignorant, with a huge false sense of entitlement. Not for me, glad I bought it on ebay for only 5.00. Even that price was too high for my wasted weekend/hours of my life I will never get back. Sorry."
4,Supremely bitchy,"I wasn't sure where it was all going during the first half, and whether I should keep reading because it wasn't exactly chick lit, but more like bitch lit - and I'm very happy I finished it! As condescending and entitled as she pretends to be, her dealing with the fate of her own financial mistakes is real and accessible, esp. in 2009. Plus, she's a good writer and I did actually laugh out loud many times.And yes, she did get a book deal because of her blog. Pretty cool for her!"
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read,"I actually read this book for a book club, and I'm so glad we picked this book! This book is made up of short stories that give you a very real and funny look into Lancaster's life after she is fired from her job. During this time she applies at every company imaginable, gets married, adopts a couple of dogs, and even loses her apartment steps! This book was laugh out loud, and I can't wait to read her other books!"
4,Bitter Is Totally My Style,"I enjoyed Lancaster's writing style, as I am a fan of snarkiness, bitchiness, and cynicism. However, about three quarters of the way through the book, it started to drag and all of the whining and complaining and bitching did begin to get to me. I started skimming a bit, eager to get to the end of this tale that probably could have done without 50 or so pages.There were times while reading the book that her spoiled, rich girl/sorority girl, utter obliviousness with regards to manners, money, or tact attitude grated on me. However, her ability to make fun of herself for who she was and to reassure us of how far she has come and what a humbling experience she had kept me from disliking her. I actually would love to have martinis with her and make fun of people.On the whole, I found Lancaster to be refreshing, fun, and easy to read and relate to."
5,one funny b---h,"this was one of the funniest books i ever read. i gave it to all my friends. jen lancaster made me long to be her friend. i thank her for sharing her talent and herself.also, her other books are just as awesome.if you want to laugh so hard that your stomach hurts, so loud that your husband wants you to share and the possibility that it may make you pee, you will love this too."
5,Hilarious and honest!,"I loved this book! As I was reading it, I came across line after line that made me think of comments I have always wanted to verbalize myself, but never had the balls to do it. I was amazed at how she transformed her lifestyle, but still seemed to stay true to her old, snarky self. Plus, I thought the footnotes were fabulous. Every time I flipped the page, I immediately scanned to the bottom to see if one was included because I thought they were hilarious!"
1,"don't care if i don't finish before book club, only reading on the toilet.","This author is completely full of herself. Her humor is mediocre at best and I've since started 2 other books. This title was selected for a book club read, luckily my book club is moreabout the wine than the actual book. I refuse to waste another minute on this book outside of the bathroom and I will show up to book club with a strong list of suggestions, as this garbage was agreed upon after several bottles of wine. Jen Lancaster is an annoying ego maniac. I can't believe she was compared Sedaris, if I were David sedaris' publicist, I would sue, this ""book"" is generic trash."
5,So funny and so real,This book kept me laughing for hours. It made me think back to my college days and kept reminding of people I knew. I loved reading it!
5,Too funny!,"I couldn't put this book down, which says a lot since I have a 3-year-old and a 14-month-old. It's a funny and quick read...the perfect escape from Mommy boredom."
2,Big Promo for Jen's Website,"I liked this book until I realized it was just a huge Bait and Switch tactic. Shame on you, Jen. Though I felt guilty inwardly chuckling at the story of a rich, pampered white girl making too much money ending up living in the barrio (hey Jen, it's the BARRIO, not the HOOD) with no luxury SUV in sight, I still chuckled. Then I realized she was merely again tooting her own horn about how brilliant and funny she is and as proof, here you are reading her brilliant and funny new book. Too meta for me.This would be a good guilty pleasure book or cotton candy fluff when you get tired of the good literature. Then again, realizing all I've done is feed into Jen's shoe shopping obsession by buying her endless self promotion packaged as her first novel, I feel cheated."
1,"Not an enjoyable read, don't waste your time.","Confession...the only reason I finished this book was so that I could contribute something meaningful to my book club's discussion. If my book club ever reads another Lancaster title, I'll opt out for that session of the book club. While at times Jen is amusing, overall, I found myself disgusted and annoyed by what a mean spirited, whiny and spiteful person she was in the face of her circumstances. THOUSANDS of people lost their jobs during the last and current downturn, yet most of those people didn't continue to act like unapologetic, entitled divas. An extremely disappointing read. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,She never really gets it... don't waste your money.,"I kept waiting for her to redeem herself, but she never really gets it. I was hoping for a light-hearted witty, sarcastic and funny book, but this is not it. The popularity of this book is as disturbing as that of Fifty Shades of Grey."
2,I just didn't get it!,"What the heck??? Those were the words that kept running through my head as I listened to the audio version of Jen Lancaster's book (which --thank God!-- I had downloaded for free from the library!) I guess I don't understand Ms. Lancaster's humor, though I thought ""Wish You Were Here"" was a hoot. Yea, that one tended to drag a big in the middle, but it was still pretty funny. This seemed like a bunch of rambling, incoherent nonsense! I'm glad this isn't a book I paid for. I would have been horribly disappointed if I had. It was pretty bad. I got through about 1/10th of the book before giving up and deleting it off my Kindle. I just didn't get it..."
3,Nice to see someone develop some maturity,A good read which provides a first hand view of the dotcom/telecom bubble. The narrator is funny and annoying at the same time.I am trying to read the author's other books --but am finding her self-centered worldview tiriesome.
3,Good but not great,"This book was entertaining, but wasn't a page turner for me. I can identify with finding a job when the economy went bad back in the early 2000s. People with PhDs were working as receptionists because no jobs were available! It's now late 2012 and some of the things in the book are a little outdated (Kate Spade) but those things were popular back then.The biggest thing I did not like about the book was the profanity. If I had know there was so much, I would have chosen something else. I just don't find it necessary."
2,"Poorly written, boring.","This was pretty terrible.Remember in The Babysitter's Club Series how the author was always describing the hideous outfits everyone wore? This was just like that, only for adults. If it hadn't been an audio book I just played in my car I wouldn't have finished it."
5,Why you should read this book right now.....,"I picked up this book in the hopes it would help me through a long flight and even longer weekend with my in-laws. It did that, and so much more! I don't want to say it changed my life, but it certainly impressed upon me a few points which I feel compelled to talk about here. 1) There ARE others of us out there in the world whose scarcastic wit is not fully appreciated by the masses. 2) Jen Lancaster has written a great book that I really enjoyed reading, and when I am having 'one of those days', I pick this book back up and re-read it to help me get over it/put it out of my mind. If that is not a sign of a great book--then all these years of reading, the astigmatism I have and the bookshelves of other books have really just been a cruel joke."
5,Fun Chick Lit,"This book is awesome. Lancaster holds no punches as she describes her former self. The transformation from high-class to nearly homeless is heartwarming. If you liked ""Devil Wear Prada"" this book is similar, but I was much happier with the way things turn out in Lancaster's tale. Lancaster can dish on fashion and the light and trivial, but she also addresses the serious struggles of unemployment and the shock and aftermath of 9/11. A great read."
5,Great Writing!!!,"Very clever and witty book, just like her blog. Jen has a wonderful sense of humor and I cannot wait for the next book to come out!!!"
3,funny but slow,I have been reading this book for almost 3 weeks- I read a bit before I fall asleep. It is very humorous but moves very slowly. I am about midway thru and honestly there is nothing to really keep my attention except the funny lines thrown in here and there. Not bad but NOT a big page turner for me.
1,More blog-inspired diarrhea,"The best way to describe this book is misogynistic. I can not think of a better portrayal of the most negative stereotypes of a woman. Yeah, yeah, I know it is supposed to be snarky and outrageous and as believable as James Frey's memoir, but it is nothing unique or insightful. The sarcastic sentiments of this book are being echoed a million times over on blogs littering the internet: ""I am a woman; I think I am smart, I can write creative insults, I deserve a fancy purse. Gimme gimme. Life is hard. Wah. The end."" Seriously folks- don't fund this woman's attempt to make a living off of worthless drivel...send her back into the unemployment office."
4,Bitter is the New Black,"raw and humorous writing style - sometimes a bit ""too much"" - tries too hard to be raw and humorous. good beach read. relatable to most young women in some form or fashion."
5,Best Book I've read in awhile,My Friend gave me this book for my birthday. I started it the next night and stayed up until 4 in the morning because I couldn't put it down. Not only do you become attached to Jen in the book but how she finds her strengh when everything seems to come undone is a lesson I really took from the book. Read this book and see how your perseption changes not only on Jen but on your own life as well.
4,Funny fluffy chick lit read!,"I picked up this book on a total whim (ok it was the darn cute cover that lured me in) on Sunday to read while recovering from a little surgery. This is absolutely what the doctor should have ordered! Laugh out loud funny at points (the line about letting you know when the tofu starts to taste like prime rib is my new sig line on the forums I frequent so that will hopefully drum up a little advertising for you!), a good man, cute dogs, a professed love of shoes/bags and a happy ending...what more could you ask for?Behold my surprise when I log onto Snarkywood this morning and realize that you are that Jen! I HEART THAT SITE!Keep writing and best wishes on #2."
1,I think I know why you are bitter,"Your book makes me so sad - how is it that life is all around you, begging you to give thanks for all the things you have - handing you constantly new opportunities to grow up and grasp its true meaning - and yet you spend your time whining and grieving things that aren't real to begin with. Let it go, baby, because it is gone! What could you do with your life if you took all your wit, humor, and belly button snuggling and applied it to help somebody else??? That's the blog and the book I can't wait to read!"
1,Book Club wants money back,"Our book club picked this book a month ago. We were pretty excited and considered contacting the author to do a little q&a.;As we began reading, each of us individually called each other with ""can you believe how awful this is?"" We decided to ditch the book and read 4% Famous. Thankfully the bookstore agreed to take them back as an exchange.I'd like to hear from other book clubs on this. We actually stuttered it was so unreadable. The self importance, superficial, mean spirit coupled with poor excecution. But again, I only read a portion."
2,Cutting edge theories and practices from five years ago,"Having read several CS books, this one breaks no new ground. Had this book come out five years ago, it would have been more useful. As is, the book seems terribly dated and not especially enlightening. If you've read nothing about customer sat, then this book is a good read."
3,old stuff,"This book should have been titled ""Best Practices,as Understood by AA"". While there's good information on how others have focused on giving customers what they want, when they want it, where they want it and how they want; there's little new ground covered. Rather than looking inward to AA people for ""Best Practices"" the authors should have sought out cutting edge solutions and provided ways to implement. The promblem with corporate inbreeding is that you limit the intellectual gene pool."
4,An Excellent Collection of Best Business Practices,"After getting past the sales and marketing pitches, the book began to provide a number of interesting examples of Best Business Practices. I would have liked to have seen more Best Practices provided. I was extremely disappointed with the blatant sales and marketing that was thrown in."
3,Outdated but still somewhat useful,"Disclaimer - I've only spent about twenty minutes skimming through the book, but from what I can tell this seems to be written before the internet was popular as most of the book seems to be about writing to government and commercial agencies for info. Still, this is useful info and for the price not bad, but this is definitely not the ""single source"" you want for skip tracing."
5,From the Director:,"Jean Goulet-Klein teaches basic exercises from bellydancing and T'ai-chi showing how to move the body more sensuously, for health and beauty. She also demonstrates some bellydancing and T'ai-chi form. Jean explains each exercise carefully, especially about the purposes for health, relaxation and for igniting that inner glow which other people can sense."
4,An Good Value,"When I first saw the price on this subwoofer I was a bitskeptical. I did not think that such a cheap subwoofer would be ableto deliver deep, clean, high quality bass (especially not down to 30hz). But I decided that I would buy it as part of my Dolby Digital home theater system. When I recieved it and set it up I was very pleased with what I got for such a low price. While it is by no means the best subwoofer out there, it delivers very good bass. Sound stays realitivly clean unless the volume is high, although it does often sound boomy. It does have deep bass, but not the deepest, it produces almost nothing below 50 hz, so consider the frequency range to be 150 - about 50 hz. If you are setting up a home theater system or upgrading a pair of weak speakers, you should seriously consider this subwoofer, especially if you do not want to spend a lot of money doing so."
1,Customer Service,"The sub is OK, rounds out a basic system, low price for basic performance. However, the one I purchased stopped working after about a month of use. KLH asked me to send the power unit into them for repair. I have not heard one word from them since. Phone calls and e-mails have not been returned. It is like I never existed. So be wary, sometimes buying cheap cost you in the end."
1,If you want a sausage factory BUY IT!,"The sweet grill over the port rocks for acurately recreating the sound of driving on the highway with the window down. The hexagon legs transfer the mighty sound of the 8"" driver into your carpet! While running a frequency test of 30hz the woofer separated from the box and the port blew out because of the stupid grill. However, it was slightly amusing watching it fly apart. If you buy this subwoofer even for [$]..."
2,Bigger is Better,"I have changed my mind about this subwoofer. The sub performed fine for the last two years, but it started having problems. It would thump very loudly when powered on and the bass would flutter as if the woofer or the amp was going out. I purchased a 12"" 200 watt power subwoofer and I am very pleased. If you can afford a 12"" sub go for it. If you want the full movie experence go for the bigger sub."
3,bad place to cut corners,"I dumped almost 3 grand into my home theater system and the last piece was a sub woofer. if i had a cheeper system this would have been a good addition. Unfortuanatly, running in concert with my very nice speakers, the bass was out of sinc and stood out. the bass just sounded muffled and out of place. I am currently not using it, becuase the bass sounds better comming out ht ethe subs on the side and front channles."
3,Good value with moderate quality,"I hooked up this sub to a JVC FS5000 mini-system to fill in the low notes. It integrated easily and really improved the sound. The only problem has been that my JVC system has fairly low-power pre-amp outputs, and the auto-on feature of the KLH subwoofer doesn't kick in until moderate volumes. I now leave the subwoofer power on all the time and the system works great."
3,"Be careful in the description of the product, please.","While reading the description of this item, I came to the conclusion that this was a bandpass subwoofer. I even called my friend to describe it to him and he had the same one, or so I thought. When I got the product, the picutre on the side of the box had legs on the bottom...meaning that is was a down-firing subwoofer. This was completely different from what I had in mind. No where in the description did it have anything about a down-firing subwoofer, nor did the pictures show any legs on the unit to indicate this.Please be more precise in the descriptions. Thank you for your prompt service"
2,Not very reliable...,"When I first bought this sub, the sound was great. It integrated nicely with my DD 5.1 / DTS hometheater system. Now, one year later, it has a bad buzz that just won't go away even when no signal is being sent to it (not even CONNECTED to the amplifier). I guess you get what you pay for. My next purchase will definitely be of a better quality and hopefully much more durable."
4,Great Deal for a Hundred Bucks,"Sweet sub that rocks any movie. If you need a little more bass for your home theater this sub is perfect. Most people with home theaters that are upgrading from pro logic to dolby digital have little tiny surround speakers. This is a great idea to balance out the sound during those action packed thrillers like the Matrix or Saving Private Ryan. If you're after more boom, like for music only systems, then you might want something bigger, but for home theaters this is perfect. It's a good size, about the size of a milk crate, it was easy to hide next to my couch. This thing gets real loud, if it's not against a wall the sound is a little sloppy. Volume, x-over, phase, and auto on, switches are all on back. Hi and low level inputs are there too. This will work with any system. Bottom line: For a hundred bucks, you can't beat this deal."
2,Disappointing for XP users,"I was very disappointed--the description said it was compatible with Windows XP. But it simply would not work on my computer. Constantly froze up, display didnot fit screen (no matter how I adjusted the resolution). It was especially disappointing because I had this game on an earlier computer, several years ago, and it worked just fine--it was alot of fun, good action and graphics. But something got lost in translation from earlier Windows versions to this one. In this case new and improved wasn't!"
3,Its Ok,"Mx Unleashed is a ok game. It gets boring riding around on a dirt bike doing nothing. Its fun the first couple of times you play it. Dont buy it because people say you can ride in biplanes, monster trucks, dune buggys and helicopters because the control on the biplanes, monster trucks, dune buggys and helicopters suck. Its really hard to control them and you dont do anything but get stuck in places and crash. The game is a little unrealistic because in the game youcan jump like 1000 feet on the dirt bike. The goals are mainlythe same on every level. You have to race other dirt bikers, jump stuff and race a clock. I wouldnt pay more then 20 dollars for it."
2,ok,"If ur into semi-realistic games, this is a good buy. If ur like me, and u actually ride mx or supercross or for that matter any motorcycle, dont buy it, its more like riding a bicycle, and the cheezy tricks are impossible, even for nate adams (freestyle champ)."
2,it is the most bootleged game ive ever seen,can you say not deserves to be a game if you get this game your a p*$$%. how do you jump over a by plane and of you do please imform me.
3,"Fun at first, then you get very sick of it.","This game looks like loads of fun when your reading the back of it at the store. When you put it in at first it is very fun and exciting. Then after a couple of hours you get sick of the lack of detail in the levels. This game is hardly a challenge. If your someone with any sort of gaming skill don't buy this game. Save your money for a better, more challenging game."
1,Avoid.....save your money for another game purchase!,"This game is an embarrassment. I love the idea of a demolition derby game, but haven't seen one in years. Bought this thinking ""what the hell.....it's only $15 bucks!"". My mistake. From the beginning of the game, I could see that not much thought went into it. Trust me. Save your money and buy a game that is worth the money and will entertain you. This game certainly won't! It vaguely entertained my for about 15 minutes."
1,an embarrasment,"bad controls, bad programming, and dinkie-toy car graphics don't make it hard to guess why this game was sold for about 2 bucks. Nice concept, but the game is absolutely awful. The worst game I ever owned. It's worth nothing, it's a waste of time and money"
4,headphones,works great...i even accidentally dropped it in the bathtub....it's just a little big for my head and it's not adjustable
4,Very comfortable Headphone,This headphone is very convenient. I had this headphone last year which I bought from FYE. And I liked the way it fits into your ears. They design the headphone in such a way that even if you talk for hours and hours you dont feel any pain in your ears as I noticed in some headphones you feel your ear paining after a while. Another feature is that you can use the same headphone for your computer/audio devices. 2-in-1 feature makes this more useful.I would strongly recommend this.
4,Great help,These pills will help your pet IF you start at the onset of hip displesia or at the onset of other joint issues. It will not reverse anything but will ease some pain .
4,Cosequin effect on dog's joint problems,"I have been using Cosequin now for about 2 weeks for my dog, who is heavy and is over 10 years old. It is still too early to tell, but I think there is marginal improvement in the joint pain that he faces. He is able to walk a slightly longer distance than earlier. The vet informed me that I should see the effect in 3-4 weeks, so still hoping for the best."
3,"Cosequin DS Double Strength Chewable Tablets, 650 Count (Purchased on 09/27/2010)","I'm new to this product, I saw it advertized on TV by Jack Hanna, I thought if it worked for his dogs it should be a good product, so I ordered it for my dog. I ordered the 650 count container because I am sharing with my Son for his dog. I thought it was a little pricey, but if it helps the dogs it is worth it."
3,OK book to review for CCNA exam but not for serious learning,"This book focuses mainly on last minute preparation for the CCNA exam, more like an exam cram book. Beside that, you will not LEARN a lot about cisco router configuration. There are limited information on every topic."
3,Go with Cisco Press,"Although this book had better coverage of subnetting than Odom's Cisco Press book, I found that Odom's book went into better depth on the exam topics. I also found a couple of spots in Lammle's book where I was forced to reread because I simply didn't understand the concepts after reading it the first time, I didn't have this problem with Odom's study guide. The biggest savior of this book are the flash cards on the CD-ROM, which helped me a lot when it came to some quick review. I passed the test on my first try using this book, Odom's, and some hands on experience through a Cisco Networking Academy Program."
4,Easy to read book,This is an easy to read book with all information you need to do your Cisco certification. Unfortunately there are some heavy errors in some chapters. It seems to be written by different people with different understanding of the technology. In some parts it could be more precise. An errata is necessesary.But over all it makes fun to read and to learn with this book and the tools that came with it.
2,Beware: Not enough to get you through the CCNA exam.,"You'll never pass the CCNA exam if you depend on this rag. The information seems comprehensive, but there are so many errors that I am certain the text was never even tech reviewed. I recommend finding a better resource and saving yourself the fifty bucks."
4,This book is the one stop shop for CCNA certification!,"The CCNA study guide is without a doubt the best written study guide available to prepare for CCNA exam. Without this guide you would have to use at least three different sources of information (the ICRC and HPSDC books, and the ITM CD). Having one study guide made exam prep easy. All the neessary test material is included and CORRECT! Hands-on experience with Cisco routers would be the only other recommendation prior to sitting for the exam. This is a must have book, worth much more than it costs."
4,"Good book, needs to be backed up with other sources",This book provides a solid foundation for the CCNA exam. Do not however base only on this book to get you through the exam. I would also recommend going on Cisco's site and browsing through their support documents when studying areas such as WAN networking.
4,gives the knowledge but does not train for the exam...,I found this book very easy read that also gives very good knowledge on how to configure a Cisco router/switch - you will not be bored!But ... this book does not train you to pass the exam. I passed my CCNA only with this book from the first time but most of the answers were a good guess based on the knowledge this book gave me. If your goal to obtain Cisco certifications I would recommend to stick with Cisco Press books.Success!
3,Good Review.....but NOT end all and be all,"I had some router experience before reading this book. Using this as the only source is NOT recommended. I passed on the first try, but it was hard. Use some other source of resource along with this one....good luck"
2,"Concise, easy to read and riddled with errors.","A good introduction as long as the reader relies on the prose sections, and not the illustations or the study questions. Shows evidence of hasty and slipshod editing. My CCNA exam contained a large number of questions on topics not covered by this book."
5,Better then Osborne and MacMillan books.,I have seen all three CCNA books on the market. This is the best book of all of them. I also bought the Sybex CCNA Notes book which is a great compliment to this book. The Keystone CCNA videos are great too and feature Todd Lammle himself. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to pass the CCNA exam.
2,the networking content is great but the router prog is not,"If you have taken mcse essential, you will agree that the networking section is good. Yet, I was not able to learn how to configure the router from the book. I think the CD exam was more help than the book. Sorry, thumbs down on this one."
4,Very good for the money.,"I think this book is very good for the price. It is a good starter book for anyone interested in Cisco routers. I gave it a four out five stars...it would have 5 but I like more graphical representation in my learning material.Good Book, Good Price."
4,Excellent book for CCNA prep,I just passed my CCNA test. This book is the best one for this topic. Know Lammle well and you can pass too!! I will continue to use this book for reference in the future.
4,"Excellent, succinct, and to the point for a class textbook.","My Cisco Academy Class has adopted this book as the text of choice for enhancing the Cisco Curriculum. Well written, easy to understand and contains useful exercises that lend themselves to hands-on and theoretical practices. We have room for more students in class and each person enrolled is urged to consider this text. Many of the CCNA textbooks are limited in one area or another. Lammle's book is robust and addresses areas other might miss."
2,Mistakes & poor editing!,"Many of the illustrations used to define & explain the concepts in this book are just plain wrong. It would appear that the editors did a poor job in detailing this book. I am quite suprised, though. I have always found that Todd Lammle & Mark Minasi have put out particularly high quality books, until now. I have even more of the same mistakes with its big brother CCNP. To add insult to injury, I tried contacting the writers of the book with questions & comments. I received no response. Try again, Guys!"
4,Most on Target Guide to the CCNA Exam,"Of the 3 study guides I used for this exam, I found that this one covered all questions asked. The only area I found inconsistent with the book was the forward that explained how the test would be administered. No ""question marking"" or ""going back"" was allowed on my exam. Otherwise the technical aspects of the book are quite correct. As these are the final days of exam 640-407, I am sure that any inaccuracies will be eliminated in the newer study guides."
4,This book has everything to pass the exam,"This book, the ccna exam notes and boston test got me a 90% with one week of study. I had some hands on with routers first but all the screen printouts are in this book."
5,Excellent test preparation,"Everything you need to know for the new exam is talked about in the book. Although there are proofreading problems (you can get the corrections from the Sybex website) I found that they did not interfere with learning the material. After going through the book, I used the CD-ROM for extra practice questions and found that I was prepared to sit for the exam (which I passed my first time)."
4,I passed! So can you!!,"I passed earlier this week on the first attempt!! This book, the CCNA Virtual Lab e-trainer (also from Sybex) and about 2 weeks of real world CISCO experience (3 years ago) were all it took. This book is very well written eventhough there are a few spelling and syntax errors. Nothing that will keep you confused! The exam was not what I expected. I focused more on actually physically putting together and working on a production network. The exam focused more on theory and terminology. It was a very hard exam. I am also an MCSE and I think that this exam was more difficult than those 6 exams. Buy the book, buy the e-trainer and study your ARSE off. That is all it takes. No great words of MAGIC, but one really good book! Thanks to Mr. Lammle and Sybex."
5,Must-have tool for the exam,"I've just passed the exam last week with 850. Most of the topic and sample questions were replicated in the exam. I find no any reason nor excuse not to recommend this book to anyone who want to be a CCNA, especially in short preparation time frame of within a month.Besides, don't take the exam without going through all the mock questions on the CD ROM!"
3,"Great book, the CD-ROM is useless","I used this book as my primary study guide. Now I can now officially boast that Cisco certifies that I know the ISO layers, IP and how to login to a router. Come on people, the exam is not that hard!The book covered all the right topics, the preparation questions were right on.I would have given this book a 5 star rating if it wasn't for my disappointment with the CD. The questions are the same as in the book, the demos are useless. In fact, questions on some of the exam objectives are not available in the CD unless you dish out additional bucks to the publisher. Thumbs down for that!Now on to CCNP... I will consider Lammle's ACRC study guide but if it's the same deal with the CD contents, forget it!"
5,Worth Every Penny...,This book is worth its weight in gold. Good clear illustrations and examples. Lammle provides good explanations of difficult topics such as subnetting. His 'shortcuts' were like gold when I took the exam. I passed on first try using only this book.
4,"Pretty Good Book, not the best","I enjoy reading the book so far. A few mistakes and errors on the answers to review questions. The book need more explanation on the last few chapters. I think it would be great to add harder questions on the review.The review questions, test questions and hands-on lab are easy.I would recommend to buy also a CCNA Practical Studies and a Transcender AssociateCert 3.0 (about 200 questions).If you have more on your budget, buy CCNA Preparation Library and CCNA coursewares/notes."
3,More pictures and simple English,"I am a Chinese. I am also a beginner in Cisco products. A lot of friends use this book as the preparation tools in CCNA. However, after reading for several times. I cannot clearly understand ALL the materials in the book. (My English may be poor.)I know that I can give up some difficult topics and memorize the hints from the web sites and then get the certificate. However I want to learn something. I want to say that I am an actual CCNA professional.If possible, I hope the authors can simplified some of difficult concepts and explain the materials in multimedia format. Also using the MS-Press training kit style to train the readers step by step in exercise.I do not mind to spend over US50 to buy a text book if it is the best. The training course fee is much higher than that amount."
4,Good for the ccna exam,"good for the ccna exam but if u plan to think, there are areas where the info is too little....take autoinstall for example. guess the objective isn't tons of info but the ccna exam.....good for people with little or no hands-on ....the cd that came along gave me no marks for a question that was correctly answered....tried to go to the web site of hercules training..never made it in a whole day...does it exist? a little nit picking now...sybex asks you to go to the microsoft site for the exam objectives in case they change...too many microsoft books i guess ! have fun."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"I just finished reading this book; I am not sure what I read -- it is very CONFUSING! IT WILL IN NO WAY HELP ME PASS THE TEST. There are zillions of typos, unclear statments, and so on. I have browsed some of the other books,which look much meatier and less confusing, and would NEVER buy another Sybex book. There are other much better books that cover the materials on the test. I am upset that I wasted my money on this book! This will definitely NOT help me pass the test!"
5,"An easy to understand but in-depth book, highly recommended!",This book is absoultly OUTSTANDING! Nothing has helped prepare me more for the CCNA test than this study guide. The authors seem to have taken the time to clearly explain the concepts behind routing and switching. Their techinical expertise clearly shines through. I recommend this book highly!
4,Great study guide and collateral materials.,"Very good study guide, the CDROM has a good test engine. There are a few small errors, so back up your studying with some reference material. As always, you should never assume you buy any book and pass tghe test only from the book. You need some hands-on too."
5,Another good one from Todd Lammle.,"Todd Lammle has done it again. I would highly recommend this book, CCNA Study Guide. This latest work,like his others, has proved to be the best in its class. It is very readable as well as technically accurate. I know that obtaining the CCNA certification will enhance my career and having this resource has been a tremendous advantage. Keep up the great work Lammle!"
2,"Don't read TCP/IP, Just use the Questions","I took the test and passed, but with little help from the book. The TCP/IP charts are all wrong, and the book is very cursory at best. If you want to pass and be successful at your job, read the Cisco Press book and use it as reference. Buy this one for the questions, only. (Todd Lammle should know the test questions; he took the test 6 times.) Then burn it."
1,The casual style lends something to be desired,I found the book hard to read due to the casual style of writing. The author uses first person and slang to teach a very technical subject. The book has errors as most do. It also does not fully cover the material neccesary to pass the test.
5,Best Preparation for new CCNA Test,"I passed the new CCNA test in about 40 minutes (including a delay when the test crashed) using this book, the Exam Notes, and a Cisco 804 router to prepare. This was the best self-study guide I have even used, and I passed the six MCSE tests also using Sybex guides. In fact, I was intially reluctant to buy this volume due to my lack of satisfaction with Todd's ""MCSE: TCP/IP for NT Server 4 Study Guide"". But after readying very good reviews in Groupstudy mailing group, I'm glad I made the purchase. I just bought the ACRC Study Guide, the Ciscopress ACRC guide, and two 2501 routers to get ready for the next test."
3,"Good for basics,weak on advanced topics","The book does a good job on network basics, the OSI reference model and TCP/IP which is good if you haven't studied these topics before. However most people interested in as CCNA have. When it gets to specifics on Cisco configuration (OK) and more advanced topics like WAN Protocols (weak) it starts to get a little sketchy.The biggest dissappointment is that the ""practice exams"" are just the same review questions from the end of each chapter of the book put onto a CDROM. They are even organized by chapter with no testing simulation at all.I haven't tried the CCNA test yet but I'm pretty sure it will take a more advanced book than this for me to pass it."
3,It'sOK,"Well written, but mostly out of date for today's CCNA exam. Good for additional material or just basic knowledge. Maybe get it at the library and save a few bucks."
4,Very Good,I just took the CCNA exam last week and passed it with a 841/1000. All I used to study was this book and the Study notes by Lammle's. Also used Boson practice tests! those were awesome! One of those tests ( series of 4) referred directly to this book and gave page numbers. That was awesome. Thanks. AG-T.. Now! off to the next adventure! GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU!
3,dry writing n' dull reading...,"I passed my CCNA with this book and the CISCO press book. As I worked hard on both books, I am not sure which one helped more. But I have a strong feeling that the CISCO one really helped.Reading this book is not fun at all. I don't particularly enjoy Todd's writing style/capability. Lots of mistakes and pointless comments. I agree that it is easy to understand, but the problem really is that you don't learn much from it...Don't buy the e-trainer. It basically repeats all the questions/procedures in the lab exercises in the book. And it is out of sync' with the book! It is totally a joke."
2,Chapter 1 terrible,"I haven't gotten past chapter one yet, but I hope the rest of the book is better than this. A lot better. The book seems to contradict itself regularly, and uses terms that it hasn't previously defined, so I have to keep a bookmark in the glossary section and flip back to it frequently(and I'm not a novice either). The questions at the end of the chapter are completely worthless. Many of them are so vague as to be unanswerable, and for many of the rest I can find quotes in the chapter that contradict the answers given. I like review questions, so I've bought another book that has better ones. But if the quality of the text doesn't improve in the coming chapters, I'll have to give up on this book."
4,Over all Good Book,"Good things: Very precise, not much detail. Good esay explanation. Some nice historical notes about some protocols, and finally a good explanation of CISCO IOS with examples. Bad points: Simple grammar and language mistakes. Q&A at the end are not as tricky as CISCO's. Some times not enough details (like ISDN)."
4,The World According to Cisco,"I'm a BayNetworks Certified Router Specialist, and used this book as my sole study guide to the CCNA, which I passed easily. The test is alot harder than the test questions on the CD, but if you know routing/routers, this may be all you need. If you're a newbie to this topic, take the class..."
3,A nice book with some problematic chapters,"I've just finished the first 6 chapters on this book. In the chapter on routing, there are MANY mismatches on naming in figures and in explainations. Also, chapter 6 on VLAN is a total dissaster. Is this chapter even written in English??? It's so confusing I think Cisco's white paper might do a better job expalianing the material than this chapter does. However, I think several other chapters are very well-written. The practice problems are very useful. The chapter on IP subnetting is awesome."
3,The book needs revision,"Contents focusing on exams objectives but too many typos which lead to misunderstanding in concepts. This is my first time reading the book written by the author whom I have heard his fame. However, I think the author should have done it much better than this. Hopefully,the 3rd edition, if considered, and/or other study guide books for 2000 Cisco exams will not be like this."
5,I passed the test with this book alone.,"I passed the CCNA exam by only using this book as a study guide. It maps to the test, has an easy to understand format, and a CD with great tools and testing engine. I recommend this book to all readers looking to pass the CCNA exam."
4,"Read the book, had experience, passed first time","Great book. I already had a ggood amount of experience working with IP addressing so I didn't even bother to look at that chapter in the book. As for the rest, it was good. Information was clear and concise. The examples were good. I passed the exam first time and am now goingt o start going up toward the CCNP. Recommend the book to anyone who wants to get there CCNA. Even with the book, I'd still recommend some work experience."
4,Excellent prep...when combined with hands-on,"Greetings from a newly-minted CCNA! To prep for the exam I used the ICRC CBT and this book (not to mention real-world Cisco experience and a VERY good understanding of TCP/IP).The book is a pretty easy read as tech books go. I read it on the train on the way home every day for about two weeks, then did some intensive ICRC work and some last-minute question drilling to pass the exam on the first try.If you read this book cover to cover and can answer all the review questions included (on the book, not the CD) you WILL pass this exam. But don't expect to pick up this book with no background in networking or IP and walk away with a cert. The Cisco certifications are still tough.Again, cheers to Lammle for a great study guide!"
4,Dan the Man - Cisco Network Academy Graduate,"Well, I'm back again. I wrote a review on this book April 3rd when I was in 4th semester of Cisco Networking Academy. I have taken the exam since then. I made an 869 and passed. This was a hard test even with the Academy, Todd Lammle's book and the Cisco Press stuff. Don't let all of these rave reviews and phenomenal scores bowl you over. A word to the wise, study everthing you can get your hands on. This book was very readable unlike the Cisco Press material. The CD questions gave me a false sense of security. They were nothing like the exam. ISDN was stressed heavily on the test and it was pretty light in the book. I recount my rating to 4 stars because, with this book alone you will not pass the exam if you are completely new to this field. You will get some good basic concepts down and it is a good read. On to CCDA, I'll pack a lunch for this one."
4,"Good, but contains mistakes","Very good book. Definitely worthwhile. But the second edition does contains mistakes. If you're treating this one book as your bible, you might want to seek other sources of information."
5,CCNA V2 Study Guide by Todd Lammle,"This is an excellent book and more than sufficient to pass CCNA V.2 Exam. I purchased this book just before 15 days of my exam.I scored 889 in first try, this is my first career exam.Todd has covered all required topics which are easy to understand from basics.I suggest even for beginners to read this book.The beauty of this book is it is very cheap in price.All the best"
5,Passed CCNA with this book,"Hi!I have given my exam on 13 September 01. Passed my Cisco CCNA exam on my first try with a score of 956. Thanks Todd for writing this book and making CCNA possible to me.I will highly recommend this book. Todd has covered OSI reference model & layered communication, Network protocols, Routing, Network Management, LAN design, Cisco IOS very well.The only weekness in this book is he has to go in more detail on WAN protocol, Bridging & Switcxhing. Hope this will covered on next edition.There are good sample questions which are very similar with the real exam. I realy enjoyed the lab session.Hasan Mahmood MCSE, CCNA"
5,Great Book for Entry Level,"I Just passed the CCNA test, mainly by reading this book once and practicing the tests from the CD-ROM. It is a great book for those with no Cisco knowledge. It is easy to understand and doesn't include a lot of garbage that you don't need to pass like other books on the subject. I read two other books, but they were not as good."
1,Not worth it.,"Didn't bother finishing the book as it wasn't helping. Confusing text made me doubt things I already knew. Unfortunate, but caveat emptor I suppose. Make sure you know where to find corrections if you drop cash on this book."
1,Back to the drawing board,"This particular book I read, thanks to one of my Com Sci professors, was really a waste of time. The book drivels more on Cisco product and interface. If you want to pass the exam, Cisco Press books are the only way to go. Take my advice, you won't be sorry"
5,This book is the one. You get what you pay for!,"Yes, this book cost me more money, but it is worth every cent!!! It has the actual Cisco test objectives covered in each chapter listed at the begining of the chapter. I haven't had time to read the whole thing yet, but so far it is fantastic. I really feel I can pass the test after looking at the quality of this book. I returned the Osborne book and bought this one. If you are looking for a CCNA Study Guide, I recommend this highly!"
2,Only a Good Start for the CCNA,"Let me start with the Pro's:[1] This is a great book for people who have ZERO knowledge of CISCO like me. Todd does a great job of explaining the things that he writes about in the this book.[2] This book does a really fantastic job of discussing Sub-Netting.Con's:[1] This book falls short when it comes to the material on the Transcender test. This book is missing at least 30% or more of the test. Becuase you will be tested on hardware inside a CISCO 7000 router which is not covered in the book. There are also some commands that are not covered as well.Also, do your self a favor and do purchase Todd Lammle's CCNA Gold software program that emulates a CISCO router/switch network. Our CISCO engineers at work however, do recommend the CISCO Press books by Wendell Odem. Also, it would be envaluable for you to go to Ebay and purchase a CISCO 2500 or better router to play with."
2,"Good Read, but information can be incorrect.","The writing style of Todd Lamle is great, however, when buying a technical book, you want it to be correct. Can you imagine buying a car, and in the manual it tells you to used Leaded Gas because they forgot to add un in front of it!I found a few errors in his books, so instead of relying on them I always went to the source... Cisco's website or books.I will not buy more books from Lammle, if you are going to go for the higher Cisco certifications, then you should definitely get a book written by a CCIE, not a CCNP. You can get the CCNP without any real world experience, however the CCIE is a different story, and that makes all the difference in the world.Sort of like Microsoft books, get ones written by Mark Minasi, he is experienced and knows his stuff well."
1,Over 100 DOCUMENTED ERRORS!,"This book has over 100 DOCUMENTED ERRORS and some that are NOT!. What's WORSE is that if you buy the DELUXE version for an EXTRA $20 bucks you get almost NO errors (same book, no errors, more $$$!). Unbelievable!"
5,Great Study Guide,"I scored 935 on my first attempt to pass this test. I studied for less than two months and used only this study guide for preparation. I have worked with ""the other guy's"" routers for several years, but I had never really worked with Cisco, so I wanted to learn how. I was really nervous about the test since I had never taken a Cisco exam before, but Lammle's study guide really helped me to nail it. Get this guide, study and pass."
5,excellent book for CCNA prep,"I used only this book for CCNA test, and passed with flying colors. Questions given in book are of great quality. I recommend this book for someone preparing for CCNA. Donot waste your money on anything else, as this alone book can get you CCNA>"
4,Great book for CCNA Test,"With the help of this book, I scored 916 at the new CCNA test (although test crashed several times.) It's an excellent book to prepare the CCNA test. There are some editorial errors and some topics are not covered enough. But if you have some hands on experience, this book is sure enough for the test."
5,THis book is a must have to become CCNA,"I saw lots of books and lots of Guides to become CCNA but this book really is the best.It's very clear , comprehensive and it covers everything you need to know. And it is even fun to read :)"
4,Good Books for CCNA Exam #640-407,"Just manage to pass the CCNA exam today, score 850. Thanks for the CCNA study guide & Exam notes! Brgds. Alvin Wong"
2,After CCNA,"This book is excellent for learning about routers and the principles that go along with them. But, the exam CCNA 2.0 goes another way than this book. Users should buy this for knowledge but not for exam purposes."
3,Great Overall - But Full of Errors,"This book would have easily been a 4 or 5 star, but it is simply full of serious errors. The errata lists most of them - and some of them are grievous - but the errata misses a few glaring ones. For instance, the IPX/SPX model is drawn incorrectly in regards to how it is mapped to the OSI layers. In the 1st edition of the book, it is drawn correctly, but in this one it is not and no mention is made in the errata list. This is a large error, that could give some people some problems. The coverage is straight-forward however, and the book helps tremendously with the test, and doesn't do a bad job teaching the command line interface (CLI) for the Cisco products. If you buy it, ensure to go to the Sybex sight, and get the errata list, and then look a little more into IPX/SPX to ensure you've got that area straight."
5,my opinion about the book,"I read this book couple of weeks back and managed to pass the CCNA exam. I think the book is excellent and well written for the exam. One requires to go through the book very carefully including the Appendix. If you understand the subject , you will be able to pass very easily. The best way to understand the subject is to study this book. One of the best I ever read."
4,Michael Milia CCNA,"This is a pretty good book, although, it only scratches the surface in a few areas. Had I not been doing networking for the last 6 years and read numerous other books, I don't know if I would have passed the exam. I probabaly would have come pretty close, but may not have passed since 82% is required to pass. I guess what I am saying is that you need to have some networking knowledge before you pick up this book. All in all, this is a Solid Book for an intermediate level engineer."
5,The best just keeps getting better...,"I read the 1st and 2nd editions of this book, but never took the test because I didn't have time.I did learn a whole heck of a lot about Cisco routers and switches, which help me in my job, but I didn't get a chance to take the exam until last week.I want to report a 949 on the new 607 exam! This is ALL thanks to Todd Lammle and his book and RouterSim. I couldnt have done it without his book and software. It was right on the money for the new exam.I am extrememly impressed with the quality of this book."
5,This is a great book!!!!!!!!!,I strongly recommend this book for anyone preparing for the test. It is excellent. I took the test and passed it the first time.
3,Excellent Study Guide,This book is an excellent study guide. But only to be used as a study guide. AFter taking a CCNA course I recommend taking the course and then using the book as a reference guide not to be replaced. The software included with the book is excellent especially the CCNA quiz and IPCalc (a shareware product that calculates IP addresses.) This book should ONLY BE USED AS A STUDY GUIDE not as a teacher.
4,If you buy it you will pass!!!,I bought this book and passed the test the first time! Well written and easy to understand! The only flaw I found was that a couple of the review answers where wrong.
3,Too small plants,"I received the plants on time, that was pretty fast! Kudos! However, the pictures posted on Amazon are misleading: the plants are too small. Moreover, they are not in a good shape and the leaves are pale green. They seem to experience some stress. Is it due to the packaging and trip? Dunno. Not sure whether they will survive. I'll be back to complete this review in a couple of months, and maybe, give more stars, hopefully."
1,So many typos it spoiled the enjoyment,"This edition of the book is riddled with typing errors - so much so that it spoiled my enjoyment of the book. Published books should be of reasonable quality. If I knew who to complain to, I would."
5,Excellent resource for the serious watercolorist!!!,"What a delightful surprise this book has been. I first picked it up at the library, but had to purchase a copy as a ready reference. There are so many useful tips and techniques for rendering natures beauty in watercolors. While this can pose serious challenges at times, this book gives you step by step methods to simplify the process. A must have for the serious watercolor enthusiast."
3,Good product bad design.,I purchased this product to use on my trip to Spain. When I got there I found out that I could not use it because it has a flat back and all the plugs I encountered where round and set in about 1 inch. The prongs could not even reach the outlet. Thankfully someone I was traveling with had an extended for the plug and I could use the adapter with that extender. The adapter worked fine.
1,Dangerous product!!!,"I purchased 5 of these converters for use in India where the current is 240v. I handed them out to relatives along with mp3 players and phones. They all overheated and one actually melted and the black plastic casing became deformed by morning when plugged in to charge an MP3 player. This product is dangerous, at least for use in Bangalore!!!"
1,Defective,Took 3 of these when travelling indian subcontinent to use with cordless phones where voltage is 220v. All 3 burnt and this is dangerous to use.
2,Useless in France without an adapter.,"Bought it to use in France. Couldn't plug it in there without an adapter. The prongs are right, but the French outlets require a different presentation. Enormously frustrating and a waste of money. It may work fine -- who knows? Why does this have to be so complicated?"
5,The Dancing Mind,One of the best speeches you'd ever want to read or listen to....I have listened to it many many times over---exquist writing and insiration.roma guy
3,Not hefty as expected,I store my mid-sized car outdoors in the winter and found that this cover doesn't do the job I expected. Leaks. I've ordered a cover that is built for my model and dust and water are now not a problem. Wouldn't recomend the PolyPro.
4,Car cover,I bought the full size for a Toyota Camry. The side of the car is not cover because of the side mirror. The design of the cover did not account for the side mirror.
4,Not a bad car cover,This isn't a bad car cover if you want to keep the dust and dew off your new or classic vehicle. Nice attached bag keeps it out of the way. I would recommend this product.
2,too short for mazda 3 HB,"the length of the cover barely fit my mazda 3 from front to back bumper, however, the cover did not reach the bottom of the car. As a result, the bottom feet and a half of my car gets dusty while the top part of my car is maintained clean. My car looks like it has a beany as the car cover. Overall, the product was ok because of the price, but I would recomend the car cover company to specify the dimensions from top to bottom of the car, or provide a list of cars that the cover FULLY is able to coverthe car."
2,Too small,This Mid Size Cover won't fit my compact sized VW Golf GTI. Other than that it seems well made.
3,Car Cover,Somewhat disappointed with this product...It claims on the box it will fit a CRX which is what I purchased the cover for...The cover fits length-wise but does not come down as far to the bottom of my car as I would like...
4,Car cover,"I received the cover promptly after ordering. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. I like the material of the car cover and it is doing what I need it to do. Note: While the mid size fits well front-to-back, the sides could be a bit longer for a 2009 Corolla."
2,Not satisfied,"The car cover resulted to be way too big for a Mazda Miata. The material doesn't seems to be waterproof. Also the cover should come with some kind of fasteners to clip it to the car and they were not included as it was promised in the product description (""Includes non-scratch tie-down grommets, rope and handy storage bag"") nothing was included."
1,does not cover all car,"It fits from bumper to bumper ok, but it only reaches half the height of the car. I cannot get it, why?"
2,Nice cover but does not last,"I have had this cover for less than 6 months and it is deteriorating. The fabric is turning to dust, In some spots the fabric has already failed completely. NOT recommended."
3,Not the best car cover,"The material is very strong and resistance; however, it left a white stuff (powder) in the car and it is not water proof as it said. Rope was not included."
3,Not quite there...,"I am a little disappointed in this product and would send it back, but my other cover was shredded in a windstorm and my car needed to be covered. I ordered an extra large size and it is supposed to fit up to 228"" and we have a classic that is 218"" and we had to stretch and stretch to get it over all the bumpers and it does not even cover down to the full length of the doors!! I had to cut a hole for the antennae which quickly ripped after all the stretching involved! It did not come with rope as advertised and there are NO grommets for tie down as stated either. You should not state things that are not true just to get a sale!!!! I usually have good luck with my Amazon purchases but I will not buy from the seller again!!"
2,Ok,The box says it should fit a Honda Fit and it doesn't completely cover it. It does keep the dust off.
5,Great car cover,"great cover for my 2011 Jetta TDI, easy to get on and off- and easier with another person. would purchase again"
2,HOLES IN THE FABRIC,"FOR THE PRICE, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BUY, HOWEVER, LIKE OTHER PRODUCTS MADE IN ASIA, BUYER BEWARE. THE FIT WAS GOOD, AS LONG AS I KEEP THE VEHICLE GARAGED. THE VEHICLE COVER IS NOT FOR VEHICLES BEING STORED OUTSIDE...THAT WAS PLAIN TO SEE. PROBLEMS WITH THE FABRIC BEING WORN TO THE POINT THAT THERE'S HOLES IN 2 PLACES, AND BECAUSE THE MATERIAL WAS SO THIN IN SPOTS, YOU'D HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN STRETCHING THE COVER OVER THE VEHICLE. AT SOME POINT IN TIME, IT WILL HAVE TO BE PATCHED...YA GET WHAT YA PAY FOR AND IT'S NOT WORTH THE EXTRA $$$$ TO PAY FOR SHIPPING BACK AND WAITING FOR ANOTHER ONE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WORN WITH HOLES IN IT..."
3,Polypro Car Cover,"This car cover is light weight, inexpensive and protects the car finish of dust and bugs. I purchased the mid-size and it is a bit bigger than needed for my Jetta.It would be good information if the company would state the size or give examples of the car models that the sizes fit.At any rate, I feel that this is a good cover that protects the car finish from the environment."
1,DOESN'T FIT MUSTANGS,I bought it for my one-of-a-kind custom mustang AND IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT.Mustangs aren't that large of a vehicle so what the heck
5,Worked well while it lasted,Did a pretty good job of protecting my Toyota Corolla against the sun and the rain. I think it lasted two summers before starting to fall apart. It was big enough I would tuck it in under the front and back bumpers. There are holes on the side so when I parked for a longer duration I would use bungee cords to hold it in place.
5,Awesome Product!,I now have 2 of these! This is an awesome product! It makes unoperable vehicles in your driveway look better while protecting the car from weather damage! The product came on time along with a gift card from the company! Awesome!!!
1,Disintegrated in 6 Months!,"My vehicle resides in Northern Los Angeles and is kept outdoors most of the time. I purchased the car cover in December 2011, but did not start using it till late February, 2012. By mid-August 2012, the car cover had lost most of its elasticity and began to crack and tear. This product is warrantied for 5 years yet barely lasted 6 months. Making matters worse is that I bought this product from Amazon and therefore it is an extreme pain in the a-- to deal with the manufacturer. I do not recommend this product unless you keep you vehicle in a garage 100% of the time. Very disappointing."
3,Not a good long term investment,Completely disintegrated in 7 months in mild southern California weather. Car only sat on the side of the garage with no abuse and little cycling. Probably only took it on and off 6 times
3,You've got to walk this lonesome valley,"You get a very good overview of what Australia is like from one coast to the other, looks mostly really barren, horrendous flies, but more creeks, lakes and water than I expected. 2001 was a very wet year there, which caused lots of problems. This walk was incredibly difficult, and Jon carries it off with honesty, dignity, in a marevelous way. The film is very low key, terrifically sad at one point. The end is very anticlimactic, as Jon says. It's not a nature film, though you do see a few animals. The cinematography is not what it's about either. You happen to go along on a very difficult journey. I am not sure why anyone would want to do this, rather than taking their time, exploring the land as you went along. But he did, and it's possible to salvage some beautiful country and glimpses of the plants along the way. The journey seems foolish, really. Like rushing through a museum just to say you did. But it was pretty interesting, nevertheless."
3,"Interesting, but...","Interesting read if you plan on randomly traveling in Wisconsin, or if you live in Wisconsin and are curious about oddball tidbits about the state. I definitely wouldn't use it for a travel guide..."
4,FF,Very helpful to the family of firefighters. The Dr. Spock of what to know and do about living with one.
2,"Good high-level information, but lacks depth and details","This books contains names that we have all become familiar with over the past several years. There were several references to chapter 7 and how to value these companies. It was really lame and not worth the wait.If you want a general overview of what everyone means when they say ""internet company"" this would do the trick. This book won't help you at all in becoming more successful in investing. The information in this book was not anything new and could easily be picked up by reading any general publication."
4,My 3 year old son loves it!!,"My 3 year old son just recently received this gift as an early christmas present. We played it together and I thought it was great. He really understood how to use it. I really like the fact that there is two volume settings and the lowest isn't too loud. The only two things that I really DID NOT like about this product was the fact that when you slide the book into the book area, there is nothing to hold it in place so when my son was using his finger to count the toys he kept accidentally sliding the book out and he would have to start all over. That is a bit annoying...and the fact that you have to put the star on the mouse almost perfectly over the star on the page in order to select anything can be a bit difficult for a 3 year's level of patience. Other than those two things I think it is a fantastic learning toy. I would recommend this toy..probably for children over the age of 3..."
2,Too Out-Dated,The electronics on this toy look and sound like they are from 1980's. Atari had beter graphics. I found a phonic toy at Ross for $10 that was so much better than this one. I really should have sent this one back but it was wrapped in brown paper that someone had already half way opened and when I finished opening it the original box came apart (And it had tape and Christmas paper stuck to the back--re-gift!) It was a bad purchase on my part--I should have read up more about the toy.
4,Great toy!,"I bought two of these for my grandchildren ages 3 to 6 years old. The toy is extremely well made except for one thing. It is difficult for a child to put ""the book in the unit"". It requires an adult to help them put it in. There should be a better system for attaching the book so that the child does not need adult help. When the book is not placed in the unit correctly, you hear the recording ""is your book in the unit?"" over and over again. It would be in the ""unit"" if the child could put it in! Otherwise it is an excellent toy."
5,Dexter is AMAZING,"Dexter is the best series I have ever seen by far. The story lines and plots are so different and interesting. This show could be compared to CSI but 100x better. Not one season is boring, each episode leaves you wanting so much more!"
5,exciting and suspenseful,"I had not seen any episodes of Dexter, but these DVDs are terrific. Just a warning. Not for the squeamish."
4,"Great show, well worth the hype","After all the hype and reviews that I had heard about this show, I was a bit skeptical upon purchase. I could not have been more wrong. This show is witty, dry, and brutally honest. It adds a different dimension to the usual ""drama"" show and is both engaging and entertaining. After blazing through the first 3 seasons, I was so hooked that I immediately went out and got the 4th. I recommend this show to everyone, and have yet to meet someone who didn't love it."
3,"Don't buy the non-HD version, the image quality is Very Poor","I love Dexter and it only gets better from Season 1 thru Season 3, BUT I wish I had bought the BluRay version. I thought, 'it's just a TV show, so why do I need BluRay?' but the video transfer his horrible. I thought it was just my copy so I rented a copy and it was the same *poor quality*. The image is all pixelated and looks grainy & dark. Spend the extra $30 and get BluRay."
4,Tough to care,"I heard a lot about Dexter and wanted to see what it was all about. The three season packet was a great deal. It was worth the time to watch, but at the same time this is a very different type of show because of the emotionless character. Tough to care about a person like that."
1,Worse TV SHOW EVER MADE!,"Oh no, I can't believe this series made it past the first season. Its such a pointless and stupid show with a morbid and really meaningless storyline, and a freak-show main character who reminds me of a weaker rip off of actually good dark super heros. What were they thinking, when they made this garbage. Here's some advice set this box set on fire and watch some decent tv like House, Rescue Me, or Man Vs Wild. Those shows at least have a point."
2,Missing Disc,so i got the set of the 3 seasons and much to my dismay i received not 1 but 2 season 2 disc 4s and no disc for season 3 disc 4
3,Awesome show,This show is awesome. I bought these discs from amazon and the discs are fine but every one of the cases were broken.
4,Dexter: Seasons 1-3,"I'm totally happy with this product. The DVD is clear, concise and good quality. I would recommend friends or anyone to make this purchase. You will not be disappointed."
1,Disappointed,"The guitar is about to break the neck. Its way too small for my teenage son. I'm not a guitar person, so I don't know how to explain this but it won't keep a tune becaue the the neck doesn't have the metal bar to tighten. And when I asked about returns it would be ridiculous to pay to ship it back and then not receive my full money back. I don't trust the company enough to order another item but I would still have shipping and handling that I was out.We have kept the guitar due to the financial burden. Thus far the crack in the neck hasn't broke."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"That's a negative one star, folks. We first watched this movie (by mistake!) when it first came out. We actually watched the whole thing because it was so funny (not on purpose, mind you). But once we got started, we just had to see what happened next. The filming was completely cheesy. The slow-mo in the last scenes had us laughing so hard we cried. The ""wolf"" attacking the bad guys was particularly memorable (not!). Have you ever seen a little kid with a stuffed animal held to their throat pretending to be attacked? Yea, well that's it. And the narrator.... he's in the movie, then dies... but keeps narrating. How does that work? I did just buy this ridiculous movie, cause we've been wanting to laugh again. But I don't seriously know if I can sit all the way through it. Good luck to the unsuspecting!"
3,Ok but not long lasting,This product is probably good for beginners or the occasional computer user who wish to save a few files. The fact that it is external allows you to switch it from one machine to the other. It is to be noted though that mine broke down within a year... A cool startup tool but don't put too much hopes in it.
2,pretty useless for storing anything real,I agree with the earlier reviewer that this is a waste of money. The zip drive with a 100M capacity isnt very useful for backing up MP3 or other large files. I can save 5-10 MP3 songs on each floppy. A CD writer is a better investment.
1,UNSATIFIED CUSTOMER,"Received the iomega zip drive. No USB cable, and no Power supply cord was included in the shipment. It was advertised that the product was considered used only because, the zip drive sent to me was not in the original packing. The original packing is considered the box it came in new. I feel the advertisement was misleading. The USB and Power cord atleast should have came along with the zip drive. I Responded to you on March 13,2011.It is now April 12th and I finally acquired a power cord and a USB cable that would fit the requirements for the Zip drive.. Also loaded from the internet 'Drivers and softwareNOTHING WORKED..It is sickening to me that AMAZON.COM would not have a fail-save procedure to protect buyers from junk. I would be very skeptical to buy anything ""used"" from Amazon.com under these circumstances.UNSATIFIED CUSTOMER"
4,"Snazzy, quick, but...","I LOVE the case, especially next to my grey laptop. Easy to set up, MUCH quicker than the parallel-port version, but watch the eject feature...my first try sent my Zip disk into the kitchen...! Also, if you are using other USB devices, the software warns that some, especially slow-speed mice, etc., may cause the drive to crash. Newer USB standards should smooth this out, but if you have an early USB computer, check this out. Also....Microsoft? What about USB for NT?"
5,Much faster than the parallel version but a little noisy,"The new cool look that iomega has given to its already very famous 100MB ZIP Drive adds a new dimension to computer storage. Now not only is storage faster with the revolutionary USB port but more user friendly and much much cooler. I bought it and recommend that you buy it NOW too... The only fault I find with it is that it is a little noisy but that's just a minor thing, I guess..."
4,Great bit of work,This drive works well from the get go. Install is nearly effortless. I recommend it to anyone that needs an easy backup for modest sized files. I've got a burner but I still use this toy because it works fast & easy. There's no formatting issue.
1,Not to be used with other USB devices.,I'm running windows 95 and I had no problem installing the drive. But when I plugged in my USB scanner my computer hung. Iomega's USB drivers are not compatable with other companies products when running under Windows 95. If you're using multiple USB devices with Windows 95 look else where.
4,Worked fine until drive malfunction,"Got this drive for an original iMac back in the winter of 1998. It worked just fine until 2002 when the eject function stopped working and it wouldn't accept any disks. It wasn't worth going through the trouble to get fixed, so a new model was purchased."
5,Should've bought this sooner,"Switching from a 100Mb Parallel Zip drive to this USB one has saved me countless minutes that I used to spend staring at the stupid little bars slowly indicating that my files were being transferred.I'm amazed at how much faster, and less of a hassle to install, this one has been. The portability has also come in handy, as has the ease with which I can switch this from my desktop to my laptop and back again. Wish I'd bought it a long time ago."
5,HURRAH!!!! I can now retrieve all my files,I purchased a zip to keep from loosing files...if system crashed...not realizing the zip would stop working first. Found a refurbished more updated with usb and I am in heaven. Now I can travel with it....
3,Disappointed in product,Arrived as expected but the zip drive doesn't release the disk once it is inserted. Must forcefully open drive to get disk out.
5,Just what I ordered.,"I was replacing my old CB, so I wanted the exact model to fit the bracket. I didn't want to drill new holes in my dash. Amazon always has what I need."
1,Doesn't last long,"We purchased this radio and have not used it but once and then it broke. May not last long, beware."
5,Love the blues and SRV,"This book is written by Keri Leigh, who was actually chosen to do the job by SRV himself just before he died.Keri's done a beautiful job. When you read it, there's just NO doubt, she loves the music, and Stevie Ray too. She has, however, also managed to get the dark side of SRV's life in there too. All in all a brilliant job. Well-written, and her love of the music is a great comfort when the story gets too sad.I loved every second of the book as I read it. It is an absolute MUST HAVE for any SRV fan out there. Get it A.S.A.P.!!!"
3,Enjoyed it; different from other SRV books,"Don't know the relationship between the author and SRV but it seems as if they were friends. This book has a more personal feel to it; different from ""Caught in the Crossfire"" as an example. As a result, gives a slightly different picture of Stevie. Not better or worse, just different. Not my first choice for SRV biography material, but certainly not a bad one. I'm immersed in a ""blues"" period and looking for as much information on SRV and other blues artists and this fit in well for that quest."
4,Split Enz and God are the same thing,The Music is excellent but sound is not than good. I adore Split Enz but this double CD need a urgent remasterization.
5,Great Gothic!,"I haven't read a Michael's book in ages and picked this one up. I absolutely loved it. Couldn't put it down until the wee hours of morning. If you like old houses, mysteries and ghosts this book is for you. Wish she would write another with these characters.Enjoy!"
3,Great storyline,"Although the house with spirits has been done repeatedly, Barbara Michaels does a wonderful job with her interpretation of this well used theme. I found myself being drawn into the tale and especially enjoyed the picturesque description of the castle. Despite its great twists and turns, I couldn't help but be sadden by the choice of endings. It does leave the reader wondering, how much of the ending was a result of the ""spirit of the house"" and how much of it was the mental workings of the heroine? You decide."
2,This one was a disappointment,"I love this author, whether she is writing under the name ""Barbara Michaels"" or ""Elizabeth Peters"", but this novel was a disappointment to me. It is a gothic mystery. Carla is a young American who suddenly finds herself the sole heiress for a Cornish mansion. No money comes with the deal, so she is going to have to sell it, but why not vacation there for a few weeks first? Well, it's a haunted, ancient mansion. And there is a legend that a young woman disappears, supposedly taken as a bride by a water monster, every two hundred years. And Carla is the next intended victim. Interesting story line, but in my view, a very unsatisfactory ending. And it all just doesn't fit as neatly together as her stories usually do."
5,The twists and turns just KEPT on coming!,"The atmosphere created in the telling of this story, at times, made you want to keep all the lights on while reading it! The plot twists and turns made this book nearly impossible to put down -- one of the fastest reads I've ever had"
5,Asi 'ta la vaina!!,"Ellos si saben representar a mi querida panama! Le dan un poquito de reggaeton de lo que esta de moda aqui en los estados, pero tambien ponen del reggae/dancehall como la cancion Bam Bam con soca y calypso del estilo panameno con La Botella. Que bien que el reggae de panama sigue sonando!"
2,Didn't get the right item,The item in the picture is not the same as what you get. I thought I would get value pack and only received the single pack. Picture is deceiving. I sent an email about it and never even got a response
5,Perfect,The cameras came new in a box. Came as described and quicker than scheduled. All in all great service and I would suggest to anyone!
1,Not woirth the money,I bought these cameras for a very special event. I am sorry to say they weren't worth the money. The pictures were very bad---the color so off it was kind of frightening. I would never buy these again for any reason. If you expect GOOD Pictures from these cameras you will be incredibly disappointed.
5,They produce Fantastic High Quality Prints!,"Wow what a great idea. I'm now a regular user of Fuji One time use Cameras, they are great to take out with friends, parties, housewarmings, just about anywhere! The idea of buying these in bulk (10 pack) sounds good for the Photographer in your family!"
4,Who still uses disposable cameras? We do!,"All of our trucks are required to have these in case of an accident. I don't know why this is still policy when every phone has a camera on it now. Regardless, we bought these they don't expire for 2 years. 4 stars for the hassle of having to find a place that still develops disposable cameras."
2,Quick delivery-Lousy photos,"Amazon delievered as quick as could be in time for our wedding. It was a last minute idea to get disposable cameras for guests to take their own photos. Well, they got used, but the quality was really bad...most of the frames didn't wind properly, so we wound up with 2 scenes on the same photo. They didn't do well in low light either. Wasn't worth the expensive price of processing. Oh well..."
3,Don't expect good pictures at night,"Bought these in bulk for our wedding to have for the guests around each table to play with. Cameras take very acceptable pictures during the day, but once the sun set, in the normally lit ballroom, these cameras produced almost worthless pictures. Without the flash they are definitely worthless, but please expect exactly what the product description says... flash range is 10-14 feet. Beyond that, you will see nothing. So if you want to take nice daytime pictures for cheap, this is a neat camera. But at night, unless you want to take an overexposed picture of someone 5 feet away, this is not the camera you want to be using- especially when development costs will hurt your wallet again just to find out how disappointing they look. The product isn't misleading, it does what it says- so set your expectations accordingly.(If you are going to use these at a wedding reception, I hope it is during the day)."
1,So disappointed!,"I bought these for a special party and everyone pretty much decided they were too much of a hassle. Besides having to ratchet the film after each picture, you also have to click on the flash button - several times before it comes on. It took almost a minute in between pictures. Nothing ""quick"" about it. I bought one for each table and for the most part, people took one or two pictures and gave up."
3,"okay, but looked nicer in picture!",Bought my 17 year old grandson a Swiss army knife for Christmas plus this holder. He loved it! A Swiss army knife is a lifetime gift.
3,"Sturdy and well made, but leather is dry.","The Wenger knife pouch is sturdy and well made, but the leather is very dry and inflexible. As a result, the surface of the top flap is cracking on initial use before I could even get the leather conditioners and neatfoot oil applied. Holds the 3 1/2 inch Champ knife although the fit is very snug making the snap an effort to close."
4,tota,"Nice 750 watt light. It is very bright. Buy the tall stands because if you get the short ones they will be too close to eye level and you will be blinded. They get very hot, but cool off very fast. Once I turn them off it takes maybe five minutes and I can put them into my camera bag with my camera. With no fear of heat!"
5,CELEBRATING THE JOURNEY!,I LOVED this book! I am a 55 year old female who has always been commited to my life getter BETTER as I mature. There is not always a lot of support for that in our youth obsessed society. This is the BEST book that I have ever read that celebrates and honors the aging process. It has great stories and exercises and does it in such an entertaining and inspiring way. I feel rejuvenated and more excited about the second half of my life than I have in awhile and more grateful for the journey I have taken thus far. It also kicked in my creative juices about what I can do to make my life increasingly more FUN and fulfilled in every area of my life. My girlfriends have also thanked me over and over for sharing it with them. THANK YOU Marilyn & Nancy!
5,"A fresh, new perspective on aging fearlessly","What a relief to finally have permission to age with grace, dignity and a bit of joy. I've joined a Fearless Group thanks to this book and am enjoying bonding with a group of ten women who have given me support and hope for the second half of my life. All inspired by Marilyn Kentz and Nancy Alspaugh. Thank you, my Fearless Ladies!"
4,Promising author!!!,"I enjoyed this author's debut novel and will surely look for more by her. A few spots were a little slow but the story was interesting and kept me reading to find out more. I hope there's a story for Gareth & one for Matthew, they both need to find someone great too!!!"
1,Bad product from KB Electronics,"I bought this product from KB Electronics.Because of this product, my digital camera stopped working.On giving a bad review to this product, KB Electronics offered me 10% discount on my next product. So, I told them that I would give a good review to them if they can repair my camera. At this they went silent. So, basically this means that they would try to make someone silent with a few dollars, but if they have to fix their problems, then they would forget all morals and turn dumb.I don't know about the current company, but beware of the same thing happening to you guys. It is possible that KB Electronics has started selling the same product by the name of its sister concern - businesses do this all the time!"
1,Didn't work,"Even though it had a lot of different sized plugs, the plug size still didn't fit my rca telephone. So it really didn't work."
1,"Not the same ""live""","Love the music, didn't love that it was recorded live. My fault for not researcing first, but I do wish it would have been listed in the product title like it usually is."
5,Any New Robyn is a Good Robyn!,"This album is definately the pared-down, sparce, and hauntingly beautiful persona of Robyn Hitchcock...most closely what you get at an acoustic show. While it may be a bit uneven, and you might not LOVE every song, as with every other Robyn and Soft Boys album this one does contain many (call it 5 of the 13 tracks - ""The Idea of You,"" ""Maria Lyn,"" and ""Idonia"" especially) absolute masterpieces! And, nearly every song has at least a few amazing moments or lyrics that keep the banality of todays music at bay. I am so thankful that there is a Robyn Hitchcock in the world, and that he is continuing to make the wonderful, quirky, and utterly unique music that he does. This album still is a must for fans, and soon-to-be fans, alike!"
2,never listen to it,"like the reviewer below, i'm a massive fan of hitchcock--but i never ever hardly ever haul this out: there's the real test of a record. it's dour, sans sparkles or a ""vibe."" never thought he'd made a bad record till i heard this. hardly any floaty melodies, either. get ""Spooked""--it's brilliant and lively."
1,This is the low point. Hopefully.,"I own every RH ablum relaesed and several test prints that were never released. Let's just say I have a lot of his work. This, however, is not some of it. Everytime I listen to this, I feel like this is a CD of someone doing a bad Robyn Hitchcock impersonation. The lyrics are trite, which for him, is the worse thought I've ever had, and the melodies are somewhat weak. I am still a ravenous RH fan and will continue to be. This album though, is far below the stratospheric standars he set with Eye, Respect, Storefront and just about everything he's ever done. In fact, this isn't even as nice as Invisible Hitchcock, which was a series of B-Sides and unreleased songs. Buy every album he's ever made and you will not be disappointed, just don't let this be the first."
3,Tell su something we didnt know,"Anyone of any intelligence knows that the media should be broadly ignored in making investment decisions. Various studies have been done on the acuracy of analsyts forecasts and econonomic prognosticators, all unfavourable (to the forecasters). Conflicts of interest abound on wall street, where the quest is not for truth but justification for massive fee raising deals. Where are all the sell recommendations?This book sums up many areas of useful information on how the Wall Street media circus really works but really has not much that is original."
3,Interesting but Inconsistent,"I am a portfolio manager who deals with the Wall Street ""Machine"" everyday. The book is on target with respect to the goings-on in the investment world. The book gets a little slow and boring in the middle but overall it is an interesting read. I enjoyed the sections on Jim Cramer but I think the author exaggerated a little bit when he states that Cramer had a hard time getting a job on the Street....he was an editor of the Harvard Crimson which can open a few doors in the world...it is this kind of hyperbole by the author that can make one question the veracity of the other stories...anyway, it isnt a bad book, nor is it a great one, but overall an interesting read."
3,A Great Narrative,"This is a terrific yarn about the fast-paced interplay between the media and Wall St. Kurtz brings the relationship alive through the personalities-their goals, their motives, their anxieties. I loved the details and descriptions. Kurtz truly understands the media as he demonstrated in his book ""Spin City"" on the media and White House. He advances the ball here for readers who are intrigued by the media and who, like myself, find wall street a big mystery. Best of all- this non-fiction book reads like fiction. I finished it in an evening."
1,Wait for the Cliff's Notes,"Wall Street's version of CNN's ""The Hollywood Minute"" - Mind numbingly repetitive, rehashing the same five stories over and over and over for 300+ pages. This manuscript could and should have been published in brochure format and placed between People Magazine and Barron's on the newsstand. While the author certainly has a valid point in his ""groundbreaking"" exposure of the conflicts of interest plainly visible the street, it need not be rephrased and recounted again and again. I thought on several occasions that I had previously misplaced my bookmark twenty pages back (""Didn't I just read this?"")Did I mention the book was repetitive?If you saw Kurtz on CSPAN's ""Booknotes"" discussing the book, you've been exposed the entirety of the content without the trip to the bookstore/library.Next time I'll take a Novocain injection in the skull instead.A disappointing effort."
2,A major Disappointment,"As a fam of Spin Cycle I was eagerly anticipating this book, but after reading only half way through I must say this is one of the most boring books I have ever read. The author brings nothing new to the table and he repeats old news stories over and over again to the point of making the reader fall into a deep coma.I don't buy new books to read old news stories. Most of the material is ""ancient"" in that it took place a few years ago and any respectable investor knows that Wall Street is all about today or tomorrow--not what happened in 1998. He puts CNBC, Jim Cramer and others under such a microscope that it becomes silly. I really don't care when Maria gets a cup of coffee or Jim clicks his mouse to buy a stock. Give us something we care about it and can learn from--not a book based on old news and yellowing newspaper articles."
1,People Magazine for Investors,"What was the point of this book? If you are a CNBC junkie, you will like the peek behind the curtains. If you have a life, and happen to be an investor, there is nothing in this book to hold your interest. There is no scandal revealed, no call to action by business or government, nothing useful about the investment world that anyone with a mild interest in the market wouldn't already know. This book is a 309-page People Magazine article."
3,Just alright,"Company is awesome, but the bars don't have any cookies and cream taste to them, very bland..."
4,CB radio,Bought this CB radio for my son for Christmas. He is a semi truck driver. He is using it and likes it.
3,"This is not the best radio out there, but it does a fair job",As a stock radio without all the mods it does a fair to poor job at best. Unless your going to spring more money to have this radio peaked and tuned don't waist your money. I would go with a Galaxy DX949 or DX959. I bought this radio as a backup and am going to have it upgraded eventually.
3,Bluetooth CB,I am not that all pleased with my purchace the CB works great I wish that the bluetooth part did not come on everytime you turn the radio on.I have verison wireless and it dont seem to work that great on it also like the other reviews say the blue light is way to bright even on low
5,awesome radio/ excellent service,Thank you for the radio. I'll be using it in the back country to communicate with other 4-Wheelers. Your service was excellent
2,Thumbs Down,"Though there are a few interesting tips, the tape is boring and useless. I would not buy it again."
1,Avoid avoid avoid,"I felt like I was waiting and waiting and waiting for the skiing to kick into high gear...and then the movie ended. Does not compare to a TGR, MSP or other major ski movie producer film, there quite simply just is not enough skiing. Save your money."
1,Chapter Six,"If you are into getting preached to about the evils of Global Warming and climate change this is your brainwashing dream.The beginning of the movie has some decent non-ski cinematography. Wait, where is the snow?There is some decent pow, but the shots are all cut up in some lame attempt at art. Clean smooth ski shots are generally better than splicing ten different lines together semi out of order.Then 2/3 of the way through the skiing stops and it goes to full guilt trip you are ruining the world, climate change is the most important thing in ski movies crap.Wait, I thought I ordered a ski movie?Save your money, or better yet, get the new MSP movie Attack of La Nina, that movie is sick.Pros:There is one sick section with some of the deepest pow ever.Cons:The movie is a downer.Soundtrack might be ok, but the lame voice overs...Final verdict? I want a refund."
1,Not a ski movie,"I was extremely disappointed by this movie, as it was high on half-baked skier metaphysics on life and global warming and very thin on actual skiing. For every brief scene of skiing, the audience is forced to muddle through environmental-awareness oriented shots (which are, admittedly, very nicely shot) and embarrassing voice-overs by the athletes. If you buy ski movies to see limit-pushing skiing that amazes you and gets you excited to get on the mountain, then absolutely do not buy this movie."
4,Provides Good Overview of Statistics,We use the latest edition of this book in our safety course to provide students an overview of statistics. The errors contained in the previous edition have been corrected and new examples have been added. The book covers various statistical examples in a step by step format.
4,Very Useful Textbook,I would have never made it through my fall statistics course without the use of this book. The book is very easy to read and follow. The examples are very useful and helped me study for my quizes and exams. Well worth of every penny - especially if you are a poor college student. This is one book that will stay on my bookshelf and not back to the college bookstore for buyback.
2,Too Many Errors,This book would be fantastic except there are way too many errors - especially for a book about statistics and statistical error.This book should cost 1/10 the price because you have to go through and find and correct all the errors - especially frustrating when using this text in a class.
3,gift for my husband,"I thought my husband would enjoy reading these books by Pat Buchanan so I bought two for him. He read both books, but neither was really a big hit with him."
2,Crazy xenophobic conspiracy theories,"Pat Buchanan has created an elaborate conspiracy theory to back up his xenophobic views. He seems to think that Mexican immigrants are coming here to claim land that they view as theirs due to old history.Ironically, the reason they flood here is because of something that his people gave to latin America . . . Catholocism. The 'no birth control' and 'no abortion' tenets of Catholocism lead to an explosive population growth among its followers. And since the economies of their native countries are unable to create jobs fast enough, these people migrate north for economic reasons. That is all there is to it.This book is an interesting read only to get a glimpse into the mind of a reactionary right wing."
3,Pat Buchanan is Paul Revere,"Pat's very well documented account of the over-immigration of America is a must read (for those in power). For the rest of us, prepare to pop tums and rolaids. It's an upsetting doom and gloom (true but depressing) look at our open borders policy and how it is killing the dream of our Founding Fathers.I had to put the book down after reading half way through. It's way-too dark to read all the way through. Closing hospitals, old diseases made new and more dangerous, American culture overwhelmed by un-assimilating hordes of third worlders, English as a forgotten language in blocks of American cities and towns!Pat is an American resource that should be exploited by every politician that wants to do what's good for America. Read this book Hillary Clinton; since you're obviously the next annointed President."
5,Modern America's Paul Revere!,"Once again Pat Buchanan is warning America about the danger of it's collision course with the deleterious effects of uncontrolled illegal immigration on our culture, morals and values. He has continued to sound this admonition for fifteen years while our current elite leadership in this country and both political parties turn a deaf ear despite continued outcry from our citizenry for border control and reform. This issue has been a ""Trojan horse"" as millions of undocumented aliens have crossed our borders unchallenged every day and night for decades and continue to do so as we speak. Pat Buchanan has had the courage and foresight to once again send a wake-up call to our leadership and complacent, apathetic citizens and agenda laden multiculturalists that the fall of our nation is near just like Rome, Egypt and modern day Europe, who also failed to heed the warning signs! A must read for all concerned Americans who are willing to take action and not just talk the talk!"
5,Essential Reading,"If you're an open borders proponent,you should read this to understand the most articulate opposition to your crazy ideas."
5,It Gave Me Chills,"Pat's book, right from the opening page sent a shiver up my spine.One of the best parts of State of Emergency is Pat's selection of quotes to introduce his chapters.In part one, ""How Civilizations Perish,"" he quotes Thomas Cahill:""Why was the border guard so thin? Did the Romans not notice... that their way of life was changing forever?As I read that it gave me chills to know that today our borders are just as unguarded and open to invasion.Rome fell. If we do not heed Buchanans call we will see the demise of the United States of America.Unlike most non-fiction books, State of Emergency is the ultimate page-turner. You will find yourself rushing through the pages to find out what happens next.It's no wonder this book has skyrocketed to the top of the charts!"
1,Misunderstanding definitive evidence,"Pat Buchanan relies on much of statistics in his book. It would be worthwhile to double check his facts with other think tanks. When looking at many other policy institutes, one can see that we are not being ""overtaken"" by immigrants. We have the lowest percentage immigrants population in US history. I often read in his book, as well as other reviews, that ""they"" are trying to take over the country. Who exactly are ""they?"" Has anyone ever asked ""they?"" Are ""they"" the immigrants who have been here for three generations, or are ""they"" refugees? Are ""they"" children who had no choice but to follow their parents? Maybe someday we will have better definitions so as not to label a group of up to 13 million with one characteristic.I would not steer anyone away from reading this book, but it would be worth it to read Enrique's Journey to at least understand the causes of immigration a little more."
1,Right Wing Rants,"Pat Buchanan is America's premier isolationist. But at least he is against the war and the Bush doctrine. Personally, I'd trade Bush for 10 good Mexicans any day."
1,We Have to Do Better Than This,"Buchanan fails to provide a workable solution. His list of references is not scholarly, and many on the list are from the same website.Hate-thy-neighbor is not a workable framework for solving society's pressing conflicts.The prevalence of Nativist views surrounding this book is reason enough to be concerned for the future of our country's democracy."
1,Good read if you dont have a functioning brain.,"Today on FOX, Buchanan emphasized that immigration policy should be reverted back to quota allocated between western European countries. Unfulfilled quota should go to relatively poorer south and east Europe. America defined from Hitler's point view. Like the other reader said, FASCISM ""LITE"" is same as FASCISM. Dear Buchanan, You dont cut your hand because of a strained muscle. Use common sense and not reactionary emotions.If mexicans and eventually non-whites are eliminated from USA, its going to be between immigrants of French and English descent and then English and Scottish. Where does it end?"
5,Thought-provoking and Dead-on True,"Excellent and thought-provoking analysis on this country's illegal immigration problem. You may not agree with everything Mr. Buchanan says, but this book will definately get you thinking. It is a serious analysis- not the typical ""knee-jerk"" populist reaction. In other words, Mr. Buchanan treats the subject seriously and has some great insights and ideas- a true conservative's outlook, not some ""neo con"" blowhard (like on the radio). If you are at all interested in some ideas to tackle our illegal immigration problem, read this book."
3,déjà vu,"i am keeping this short. what most amazes me is virtually EVERY One of the arguments made in this book were the same ones used against the Irish, Italians, Japanese, eastern Europeans, Vietnamese, Cubans, Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, ect. my heritage like Pat's is Irish BUT i don't forget how we were treated and so say screw the WASPs and the powers that be. they didn't want us here and somehow the country is better for us and the others being a part of it. why the hell is any Irishman siding with them?!?"
5,Fantastic Reading Material! Quick delivery! Real Good Condition!,Purchased as a gift! I know he will be anxious to begin reading right away! Thanks!
2,I've heard this all before from Pat.,I think Pat keeps writing the same book over & over but calling it something different each time.
1,Since when...,"Since when did ol' Patty-boy see fit to start ripping off Michael Savage? This is the sermon Michael Savage and the Paul Reveres have been preaching for well over a decade now, albeit, to some extent, on deaf ears. Borders, language, culture. People, that's the essence of Patty's book here, just a rip-off of Dr. Savage - someone of which Patty has obviously been reading much.At any rate, whether you agree with the message or not, this garbage is barely worth one star simply for the fact that Patty-boy can't come up with an original message to save his life/career. Rather, he resorts to standing in the shadows of others. Pathetic."
1,What the @#%&,"I remembered playing this game when it was released it was fun .but then I lost the copy of my game . I ordered this game now only to find out that this copy is not playable at all game as an option menu but it doesn't work . diggles work on surface but doesn't dig at all , so play is just over on surface. I am not happy with it at all"
2,You Get What You Pay For,This recorder is very cheaply constructed with inconvenient controls. Pay a little more and get a Sony.
3,Medeokre,"I would like to say that for the amount that this product cost, it was worth it. However, there was an excessive amount of static picked up and I was not all that impressed. Fortunatley I will not be using it frequently, so if you plan to I would not recommend you buy this product."
2,when will I learn?,"If I had just waited til the weekend, I would've had the opportunity to shop for a small recorder. Ah, but I love the convenience of online shopping! So, not only am I a dunce but lazy, too!This is really not worth a penny of your money. DON'T GET IT!!Poorly constructed - doesn't play well. China gets more of our American dollars! Forgive me, fellow citizens!"
3,"Suits my purposes, but not clear sound","I purchased this micro cassette recorder for a student of mine. I teach in a middle school special education setting and have a student with autism that needed reinforcement with her reading skills. She enjoys hearing herself so I needed a cheap tape recorder for her to take home and practice reading.She uses it all of the time! It is a great size to toss in a bookbag. It doesn't go through batteries badly at all. The sound quality is a bit ""canny"", but it suits my purposes fine."
2,not what i wanted!,"I needed a micro cassette recorder that I could use it with headphones and with this one you cannot. When you plug in the headphones automatically the sound goes off and you can't hear anything you recorded quietly with headphones, without disturbing anybody."
5,An abundance of treasures,"I have been re-listening to these terrific CDs and appreciate them more than upon first hearing them. As with other Telemann programs by the wonderful MAK, this one---and it's a big one: 4 CDs---serves to destroy any notion that Telemann was a boring, long-winded, repetitive artist. The variety and imaginative combination of instruments make for pure delight indeed. No group has done more to further the much-maligned reputation of this great, gifted baroque composer. If you haven't moved beyond Bach and Handel in your baroque meanderings, this set of Telemann works is a wonderful place to start."
4,Other Books,"A very well done book, with insight into this area that is engaging. Definitely a job you don't want. The story of a bunch of English bombers whose job it is to take out some strategically important German dams, unsurprisingly. Brickhill is a fine war writer, so anything on that subject by him is worth a look."
5,So sorry to see it go!!!,"I have also used this product for years. I have always had combination skin, even into my 50's now and this product is the best. Not too drying for my drier patches and the microbeads keep the oilier areas under control, and I use it daily. As this product was becoming less available, I was it afraid that it was being discontinued. I have tried other things including: Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser (too few microbeads and cleanser is creamy but more drying), Olay Total Effects Citrus Facial Scrub(again, too few microbeads and cleanser is more of a gel, but even more drying),and Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Brightening Daily Scrub (this one is the closest to the Nivea product with a nice tea tree oil scent, but still falls a bit short of the Nivea product). I'm stocking up again, but I guess when I finally can't find this product I hope the Aveeno alternative will still be around..."
3,Not very inspiring.,"I bought this book new thinking it would show dozens of ideas for tablescaping. It was a disappointment. It is very basic and although it does have pictures of different themed tables it was not very inspiring. It is yet another book I should have ""pre-viewed"" in the bookstore before deciding to buy."
2,Headset doesn't fit ALL size heads,"While this headset looks great (and Coby is an EXCELLENT brand), the rigid design isn't flexible or moldable and doesn't fit all-sized heads."
3,Product is good but quite pricey for what you get.,Shipping was very quick. I was a bit surprised at how little I actually got for the amount of money I paid.
3,"More like ""Cool Blue""","Bulbs are great minis, but the light they emit are more blue than white. One more thing, the price really isn't worth it, as others have noted. Just a week after buying them, Costco had real white ones for sale for less than $4 for a package of 8 (and that's after taxes)"
5,Gwo Ka percussion fest,"Powerful music. If you like the Gwo Ka style, creole music, or congolese and/or guinean percussion, this CD is for you. This is roots music, filled with cultural richness, and this group does justice to the tradition. They deserve your attention!"
5,Beautiful,"This is one of the most beautiful & thought provoking documentaries on body modification that I've seen. There are a few moments that might make you cringe, but this documentary is very worth every cringe or gasp."
1,Not for sensitive People,This should be rated a BIG M! For parents or moral people out there this is not a suitable Documentary at all!
5,Helping Children write and illustrate their own stories.,"I greatly enjoy this book, and I intend to use this in a class room setting as soon as I can gather the materials, and generate some intrest in the kids. I think it will do wonders for the childrens desire for hands on creativity as they see their thoughts and ideas put into print.Valerie Bendt is wonderful."
1,Upset Customer!!!!!!!,"This company explicitly states that this battery fits the Sony VX-1000 camcorder. After waiting 10 days to get here, I open the package to discover that this battery DOES NOT FIT THE VX-1000, not even close. Great, now I have waited 10 days just to be dissapppointed and now I have to make a return, reorder with some other company that KNOWS how to properly list their products. THANKS FOR NOTHING and all the FRUSTRATION. Idiots!!!"
5,Will Young does it again with All Time Love,"Will Young has done it again is all I can say! This is a beautiful song with a stunning video set in what looks like Fascist Spain and it not only proves that Will is a fabulous singer with a voice to die for but he is also a man who should do more acting, he is SO good and the song, it is haunting, moving, slow and so very elegant, it reminds me of velvet cream sliding off my tongue.Look out for the girl behind the veil in the amazing court scene in the video, the song and the video were just meant for each other.WONDERFUL!"
5,A Brave soul tells all ...,"Yes, sad reading, but eye opening and I salute the man who wrote about his beloved wife in the dying phase as she courageously did everything to hold on to life. A huge example to us all and much appreciated the sharing."
5,love these cards,"wow what can i say about these cards , i get strong readings from them an there vibrations are verry strong sometimes i get head spins, make sure your well grounded when useing these cards."
3,Product packaging opened and shuffled on arrival.,"The individual product was absent the usual card package seal and the contents had been shuffled. Not a good thing with cards of this type. I have energetically cleansed and healed them. If problems develop I will let you know. The product should have been sold as ""opened-used"" and not ""new"". Thus this product is not up to the usual Amazon ""new"" quality."
2,should be called Bella Rainbow Bright,"This is not what I was expecting for the money! I thought it would be an adult instructor, not a 14 year old who looks like she's auditioning for a Rainbow Bright video. Only about half the 30 minute video is actual ballet, the other half is silly dialogue with puppets and another song that isn't related to ballet. (about good eating habits.) The whole thing is rather ridiculous. That said, my 6 year old dd loves it. She enjoys using the mat and barre."
4,everybody hates chris the complete season,"chris rock voices as the narrator of the show. the season is about his life growing up as a kid and many of the things that he experienced and it gives you an insight of how he was raised growing up. not really for kids because of the language that he uses and because he is the only black child going to the school, there are many racial comments thrown out that many people may take offense too. i personally thought it was too much at some point and no longer thought the episode to be funny, but its a good show to see because i know its about his life and i am able to see how hard he had it growing up as compared to the children of today."
5,Actually Everybody 'LOVES' Chris,"I actually ordered this for my grandson, who first saw it on TV, then downloaded episodes onto his iPod, then wanted the whole series. He has gone through the entire series, and now, while out of school for the summer, watches the episodes over and over. The entire family has laughed over and over at how funny these DVDs are. Some of the language and situations were inappropriate during the 80s, on which it was based, and even now, but if you don't take yourself too seriously, it's absolutely hilarious. Chris Rock was and is a favorite of ours and sometimes too shocking but too funny for words. Reminds us of how times have changed and how to laugh at ourselves."
5,Marvelous!,"This is a fantastic situation comedy with loads of humor, fun storylines, and interesting characters. It is hysterical to watch and makes me chuckle, though some content is a tad bit mature and should basically be only viewed by teenagers or young adolescents who already understand the subjects dealed with or mentioned in the episode (such as teen pregnancy, racial stereotypes that many misguided characters believe that Chris, the main protagonist, may possess, et cetera) but other than that, it's a fantabulous program for anyone old enough to understand any inappropriate subject matter."
2,Cut and paste book,I don't like or recommend this book for the following reasons.1. Why is the Mayan 20 count included in a book about the Cherokee?2. Raven Hail goes into an astrological system that seems to imply that one's future is set in stone. It is NOT. I am living proof that one can be anything thet want to be; providing they have the will and desire to change their life.The book has a few Cherokee legends.Please E-Mail me if you have questions or comments about my reviews. Two BearsWah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)
2,Very Imaginative,A New Age version of the Mayan calendar given new Cherokee-esque names. What is reprehensible about this book is that Raven Hail is in fact a Cherokee tribal member.
1,many questions raised,"The Cherokee Sacred Calendar is a piece of writing that begs for explanations. Why is the Cherokee astrological system essentially the same as that of the Maya and Aztecs and why hasn't this come out before? (We are also informed of the news that the Cherokee counted in a vegisimal system of dots and bars exactly like that of the Maya). Why do only some of the personality descriptions seem to be cleverly lifted (a short string of words at a time) from those in the book ""Day-Signs: Native American Astrology From Ancient Mexico"" but not others? Why are the tables the same as those in that unmentioned and uncited book? These are questions that both the author and the publisher need to answer."
2,"Two titles, two publishers, SAME BOOK","Warning, This book, and the book titled ""Cherokee Astrology: Animal Medicine in the Stars "" published by Bear & Co. ARE THE SAME BOOK.The titles are different, publishers are different, but it's the same exact material inside.Other than that, I question the validity of this work. Yes, there are some things that are Cherokee-words, a few pieces of stories (not much detail) but I really have to question, especially since she doesn't give any background, whether this is simply Cherokee stories pasted over the Mayan calendar. Information on Ms. Hail and her background, studies, etc. is scarce.This comes off as untrue, a bit new agey, and really does not do the preservation of Cherokee ways any justice. In my opinion, misinformation is worse than no information. Don't write something and say it's Cherokee when it's not. That is an insult to my ancestors.She could have at least sited her teachers or some lineage of teachings."
3,Insightful,"I found this book interesting; the symbolic natal sign easilyaccessed using Raven Hall's charts was most interesting and not at all a surprise to me! I do wish more information as to how Raven Hall's claim this information came from ""ancient Native American Tradition"" was discovered .Since the system is so strongly similar to Mayan systems, is Raven Hall suggesting Mayans and Native Americans are interrelated? I would love to hear the answer;in spite of this ponderings, I truly enjoyed the book!"
1,horrible movie!!!,"OMG this movie is so annoying, I stopped it after 5 minutes. My 7 yr old even left the room,saying: ""I don't like this movie"". William Shattner's raspy voice-over will definitely win the most irritating character voice of all time. it's cheaply made & looks more like a puppet show than a cartoon movie. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE."
1,I'd give a zero-star rating if possible!!!,"This is probably - no, positively - the worst movie I have ever seen. Made the mistake of buying it; first time I couldn't continue watching after five minutes. My three year old wanted to see it and she watched maybe seven minutes before she left the room. William Shatner should be mortified to have his name on it. Or, hey, is it SUPPOSED to be a caricature? Truly, it didn't deserve the one-star rating I left, but there isn't a no-star rating available. Avoid it."
1,"Terrible, weird creepy","We rented it from redbox thinking it was the Antonio Banderas version. It was horrible, creepy and something which people on a bad meth trip probably made. My kids are too young to realize how bad it was, but I was weirded out by it. Must avoid, worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad that I had to log into my amazon account to write just how bad it was. It was even worse than any Bollywood crap or Indie horror Euro cult movie."
1,Crapfest,"I selected this on Netflix and was increasingly annoyed with this movie. Immediately you feel uneasy and there is 0 connection with the story or the characters. Within the first 5 minutes of the film, I realized that this was NOT THE MOVIE I WAS LOOKING FOR and was feeling actual distain for the aggrivating protagonist! I originally was hoping this was the Shrek Trilogy character. Nope it was a poorly animated, horrifyingly arranged wannabe. There was nothing to look forward to except to find the escape button and find a different movie to watch.DO NOT BUY this movie. Save your money for something like a dental visit, renewing your license at the DMV, or getting a haircut. All of which are MUCH more enjoyable experiences to sit through. It pained me to even give it 1 star. Negative 5 stars is more like it. P-U! This stinkfest is a tragic waste of man hours, film stock and no one should have to be subjected into giving away 90 minutes of their life watching this hot mess."
1,What a waste,"Rented this flick for my toddlers. What an absolute waste. This movie was like watching paint dry. No humor, no action, nothing entertaining except for maybe the annimation which, by the way, featured a very shapely ""queen"". The voiceover for ""Puss"" was downright creapy.My kids watched the movie with marginal interest and ended up disregarding it after 15 minutes.Don't waste your money or time on this movie..."
1,"Horrible, creepy movie","This movie was purely awful. The voices are terrible. The queen sounds intoxicated, the voice for puss n boots sounds like he has bronchitis and says strange, random things. Terrible movie don't waste your time, go straight for the DreamWorks version that one is cute."
1,Will cause premature death,"My life has been shortened by some 4 years, and that was only from watching about 10 minutes of the movie. So terribly awful. If you value live, don't watch this... thing."
1,Great for naptime,"I rented this movie for my girls, thinking it was the Dreamworks version. I had no idea they are two different movies. Anyways, after the first 10-15 minutes, my girls put themselves down for nap. Not long after I was sleep myself. Whomever put the money up for this film is probably still kicking themselves. HORRIBLE!"
1,TOTALLY BUSH LEAGUE,"WTF! This movie is creepy like a bad mustache. I would rather drink boiling water than ever sit through 10 minutes of that movie ever again. Thankfully, I only lost 10 minutes of my life. I actually apologized to my child for even putting this movie in. How did this even get made. Got duped as others did with the Dreamworks version on the way. Do yourself a favor, never watch this, and tell everyone you know this was the best movie you have ever seen. When they get back to you with WTF!!!! You can have a good laugh. Would have gotten 0 stars if that was possible"
4,"Fun & creative but not a ""typical"" movie","This movie is unexpected and possesses more of a ""fable"" quality than most major motion picture productions. I watched it with my 4 yr old and my 7 yr old. We found the music very enjoyable, and the queen's voice-over cracked us up. Witty banter throughout. It definitely won't be suited for everyone's taste but our interests are wide and varied so we enjoyed it. Our kids are still talking about it, quoting lines and even humming the songs."
4,"Weird, But Very Enjoyable!!!","I Really Enjoyed this Movie, it's a little different, Yes! But overall still Very Enjoyable, and the Cat was Awesome, I think we all have friends like that, lol."
5,Fantastic movie,"My kids (5 and 2 years of age) and I really enjoyed this, not so mainstream movie,with incredibly funny music, It is highly underrated."
1,William... Why?,"I just have to say, all reviews were spot on. I as well allowed my son to rent it, not knowing the fact there were two puss n boots made. My son paid less attention to this than any other tv show/ commercial he has been placed in front of. He only watched when the princess or whom ever was singing in the bar, short lived at that. We heard the voice of PNB and as my wife and I cringed the only funny thing was to see my son doing the same... William Shattner.... WHY?! I am scarred for life to think this is where you have gone. I am only further upset that I must wait another thirty minutes to return this disc to the Redbox and waste more money on gas. I am only overjoyed that I won't be spending another dollar to keep the movie or worse have to buy the movie because my 12 ga. leaped into my fear stricken hands and I happen to pull the trigger with that disc in my sights... Only advice: Know what you are renting"
1,creepy,we turned it off within 5 minutes. It was just 'off'- too creepy. I think if I had watched the whole thing I would have had nightmares- and I have no idea what my kid would have made of it. Did not seem geared at kids.
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!,"This movie was horrible. The characters are not likable at all. Not even the cat. You can't even tell in which era it takes place. The women are usually dressed very provocatively (why?). What's with the tight body suits??? To me it had a freakish ""dark"" feeling to it. Why would they create such a movie when children are the primary audience??? I have not yet seen the New Puss n Boots. Hope that one is better."
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE! A scam! Do not buy this!!!,"This is probably the worst movie ever. Seriously. We rented this thinking it was the Dreamworks version and were quickly disappointed!!! The script is horrible, the voices annoying, and the characters are all poorly written (the queen is a disjointed drunk sort, the princess is a b!#Ch, and the miller's son is not at all likeable....never mind the cat (William Shatner) has the worst voice I've ever heard. This is really really HORRIBLE). Most of it doesn't even make sense. Think it was just a big scam to trick people right before the Shrek version came out. Enough said."
1,Horrific voices,"The cat's voice is horrible, at best. The queen sounds like a drunkard. The king never talks. The chamberlain looks like a bad clown, jester or something... if you can get past the horrible voices in this, the animation isn't THAT horrible. I kind of like that part of it, but that's it. I rented it on redbox & wish I would've saved my $1. To make matters worse, my 9-year old likes it."
1,My kids hated it.,"Shatner trying to do a cat voice was a complete FAIL! My ears were bleeding after fifteen minutes of dialoged. A high pitched nasal nails-on-chalk-board kind of terrible; Shatner singing ""Rocket Man"" terrible! The singing in the movie is just as awful - it's pretty bad when the actor's voice always cracks during the high notes. The story made no sense and had no content. Not even humor. I mean, they tried to be funny, but the punch lines to every joke kind of drifted off and got lost in a corn field. Just don't watch it. Your children will thank you."
1,This movie was a turd.,"This is the worst kids' movie I've ever been subjected to. It's totally inappropriate for kids of any age. It's racist, sexist, the characters are ugly, the animation sucks, the story is weak and predictable, the so-called music is horrible, and Shatner's voice is just grotesque. I feel fortunate that I neither bought nor rented this movie, but if I can deter even one parent from doing so or streaming it and wasting an hour and a half watching it with their kids (while possibly scarring them emotionally) then maybe I'll feel slightly justified in having had to suffer through it firsthand."
1,My ears are still hurting...and my husband is still sleeping!,"We rented this to watch with our toddler. I'm getting a headache, and it's put my husband to sleep. There is no real story in this movie. The cat is a ridiculous character that speaks shrilly and has no depth whatsoever. We generally enjoy children's movies that are well written, but this one is far short of that mark. Save your money--more importantly, save your time!"
1,Weird and creepy. Don't be fooled!,"I rented this thinking that it was the Antonio Banderas version...do not be fooled like I was, this movie was horrible! My husband and I turned it off 5 minutes into it. I had rented it for my 3 year old, it was definitely not appropriate."
1,Garbage,"This movie is absolute garbage. I was not surprised to see a film made to further capitalize on the wildly popular puss-n-boots character from Shrek, but this is going to far. With graphics that would rival a 2001 video game and a pointless story line, Phase 4 has successfully robbed millions of viewers of life for the 5-10 minutes before shutting it off. I would be hard pressed to believe that even the producers endured watching the entire film. Shame on Phase 4."
1,HORRID!,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I managed to drag myself through 45 minutes of it. The thought of it makes me cringe. The voices are absolutely awful, the animation is awful, the plot is awful, and the movie is awful. And what's with the castle in the middle of a swamp, with palm trees??"
1,It will make your ears bleed,"Avoid this movie at all costs. It is absolutely horrific in every aspect. My wife and I rented this Blu-ray to watch with our eight year old daughter and five year old son, and every single one of us thought it was atrocious. Especially the voice acting. I like William Shatner as much as the next Trekian, but he did a terrible job as the voice of Puss'n Boots (it made me want to put sharp objects in my ears).If I could give it zero stars I would. Do yourselves and your kids a big favor and never watch this movie."
1,Not what I expected!,"We rented this movie thinking it was the dreamworks version, it's NOT! Very strange and twisted version. Not suitable for young children."
1,OMFGosh!!!,I am dumber for having watched this movie. Do not waste your time. It was an hour plus of dumb music box movie and freaky dancing clowns. And a dumb cat that sounds half dead! Beeeeewwwwaaaaarrrreeee!!!!
2,Should be rated PG,"My little one is really into cats right now (especially orange ones), so I thought that she would love this movie! Sadly it did not get her attention and honestly I was glad after watching it! I am not a fan of this version... I think that the way the animated characters are dressed are inappropriate for you children, there are some pretty dark scenes, and the voices are just creepy(William Shatner really should have used his regular voice)! This movie was just not age appropriate for us! The animation was really great though!! I would have to say that we DO NOT recommend this movie to everyone, that parents should watch it first to see if they approve of it for their child (should really have a PG rating)!!Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to review for Phase 4 Films through Team Mom. I received this movie for review purposes only. I was not compensated to write a positive or favorable review. This is Keeping Up With The Rheinlander's personal opinion."
3,either...,Either this movie was a masterstroke of artistic genius or the worst kids movie I've ever seen. I don't know enough about movies to be sure. My wife rented it thinking it was the Shrek Puss in Boots and we kept waiting for Antonio Banderas to stop talking in falsetto (not realizing it was William Shatner - and that alone was worth the cost of the rental). Either destined to be a cult classic or just plain terrible. I'll let you know after I stop laughing. The music was good and the princess had short dark hair with brown eyes - you just don't see that with princesses very often.
1,wtf is this,"OMG do not get this, this is not made by Dreamworks, its garbage... if rotten tomatoes ever gave this a review it would be a rotten 0% tomatoedit: my mistake it is on rotten tomato's <...>"
1,Run...escape while you can.,"Okay...here's what you need to know. 1. The opening theme sounds like bad intestinal gas. 2. The queen acts and looks like a very drunk Roseanne Barr. 3. William Shatner tries on a feline voice and sounds horrid. 4. The Princess looks like Halle Berry and sings the seduction scene from Bizet's Carmen, which is not family material. That said, you've been warned. Run. I caught this stinker on Netflix and I'm still recovering. Rated one star but should be ZERO.Don't waste the money on this. Get the Antonio Banderas version, but neither are actually true to the fairy tale. The True Story, indeed. This one is almost as bad as Titanic, the Animated Musical."
1,Rated i (square root of negative one),"Here is my 7-year old's review: ""Worst kids' movie ever. I'd rather watch 2 hours of Dora than 5 minutes of this crummy stuff!"" We rented it from Red Box, so at least we don't blame Amazon for foisting it off on us. Wish we'd checked here first!"
1,I wish I could give it negative stars!,"I thought this was the movie with Antonio Banderos' voice. One of the biggest mistakes of my life. A few minutes into it, I wondered why it was so horrible and went on the web to figure out I got the wrong movie. My only problem was that my five year old actually wanted to keep watching it. I thought that even at five she would be able to recognize weak animation, a lame/unfunny script, and irritating voice overs that weren't even close to matching the mouth movements. It was like watching a bad video game that went on forever. The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves."
1,not a childrens movie at all,rated R!!! Mr shatner should be ashamed horrible horrible movie!! dont waste your time or money if i could rate this movie with a - star i would
4,love Andy Sheppard,"Love Andy Sheppard's sax. I love his tone, love the fluidity, love the lyricism. I fell in love with it during his forays in Carla Bley's many albums. This music is definitely different than Carla Bley's. Her music is a very personal take on the idiom of ""jazz.""The music in this CD are evocative soundscapes of wonderful saxophone and guitar. Just sit back and listen. Beautiful stuff. Tough to explain. Just give it a try."
1,A negative star book,Sham Tickoo should stop writting books. Sham organizes the book around a few types of design projects. This is one of the most terrible books I have ever seen in my entire life.This is why there are used books on Amazon. The graphics and text are terrible. Why to people buy his books? Do no make the same mistake that I did!
2,Not for a new user. I am a new user.,"The SolidWorks for Desingers 2004 book is a good book, I think for advance users. I am not sure. I am a new user. I am using SolidWorks for 3 months. My company moved from Pro/E to Solidworks. Good move. [...] I am concern with learning SolidWorks quickly. [...]The book is filled with pictures and figures, but I do not understand the commands and layout. The book is not helping me with explaining the terms, commands, menus and layout. The exercises do not make sense and I have located mistakes in the book. [...] I am sure that Professor Tickoo book will increase my knowledge, once I understand how to use it."
2,Not a very good 2004 book,...my boss informed me that I needed to learn the differences between SolidWorks 2003 and 2004. My company is upgrading in January. I would not recommend this book to learn 2004. This is an advance book that does not cover any of the preliminary details and is written in a jumpy fashion. It is very confusing to even a user for two years....
1,Junk: 2004,"I question book reviews from Sham. Sham created an 800 page book of questionable information. The book is filled with gaps, miss spellings, menu and command mistakes, etc.Sham does not even explain the native design philosophy of SolidWorks itself. If you are looking for a balanced introduction to SolidWorks, or for a reference guide, do not buy this book."
3,Not bad for the money.......,"This is a pretty decent CD, especially when you consider it is priced under $7.00. However, if you are looking for just one CD by the Grass Roots, you would be better off to get their ""All Time Greatest Hits"" CD. It's a little more money, but you get a much better cross-section of Grass Roots music. If, on the other hand, you just want another Grass Roots CD that sounds good, go ahead and buy the ""Temptation Eyes"". I wasn't disappointed and I don't think you will be either. There is just something special about the Grass Roots............."
5,Excellent,One of the best collections of the works of the Grass Roots on the market! Their Midnight Confessions is great!
5,Great Classic Rock Music,"What can I say about the Grass Roots? For anyone lucky enough to have been a teenager during this groups prime, you have to have fond memories of what you were doing when you hear these classic songs, I know I do. Outstanding in all catagories vocals, lyrics, and music."
5,Sooner or Later This is Grass Roots at Their Best,"Good quality sound. If you like music from the '70s or want some travelin' music while you drive, this is an excellent choice."
3,Ok for the money,"You sometimes get what you pay for. I was interested in this radio after the fancy Grundig Porsche style radio's antenna broke and it stopped working. For small change and less leather, this radio is about equal in lack of sensitivity. For strong signals, it's fine. An external antenna jack would be nice."
2,There are other places and other brands,"I purchased this model for a lower price at a local ""mom and pop"" store in my town. This model is quite cheap in quality and rivals Goodwill in value. That's the problem, the tuning indicator sticks while ""sweeping"" for stations, and since it's a low-market model, it lacks decent sound quality and any form of sensitivity. It's not too bad if you've recieved it as a gift, but quality control is severely lacking for this company."
2,A bit short of middle-land,I don't like righting a 2 star review. I tested it befor I sent it to a kid in Africa with a 2nd radio. Am was really poor.
3,Good Radio but doesn't always work.,"I bought this 12-band radio and it works great in the US and in Latin America, but unfortunately it does not work in Europe."
2,"Ok for the price, but one major flaw","I was wary of buying this radio due to the negative reviews, but for$10 I thought it'd be worth a try. AM/FM come thru just fine, and Iwas able to pick up quite a few stations on the SW bands even in theafternoon. I'm in North TX and was able to hear Radio Havana, RadioChina Intl and Radio Canada, as well as a few other ones I could notidentify. There is some signal drift and few stations came in crystalclear, but for that you will need a real (and expensive) SW receiver.For the price, this is more than appropiate for a casual shortwavelistener or someone who wants a good emergency radio.**EDIT: After about a month of using this radio, I realized thatthe shortwave frequencies are labelled wrong. For example, the needlesits on 11.35 mhz, but you're really listening to 11.75 mhz. Irevised my review and shaved two stars off for what is a major,major defect. I'd rate it lower if it wasn't so cheap."
1,Terrible!,"This radio cannot isolate stations, and as I flip through ALL of the SW bands, all I get are AM and FM stations all overlapping.. It's borderline impossible to isolate any one station on any band outside of FM without having at least one other station audible in the background.. Bad circuitry or something, because it seems that everything is polluted by AM and FM.. Like they screwed up the circuitry allowing cross-over.. JUNK."
1,Serious AM issues,"My biggest complaint is that the local AM stations are not tuning in at the proper number on the dial. Of four regular stations in the area, this radio only picks up two. The two stations I do get, can be tuned in at the lower numbers on the dial and then again at the higher numbers but not at the number it should be. I have had better luck with five dollar transitor radios."
1,WEAK!! will not pick up local stations!,"This radio does not have any oomph to it! My husband works (driving a route)in the city where he always has listened to the local stations, that is until his old radio died! I bought this to replace it and all it does is emit a fuzzy static sound over a station. It sounds as if you're trying to get a signal from a distance too far! Save your money, this does NOT work!"
3,Sound quality is OK,Sound quality is OK. Though there seems to be some issue with the tuning knob (time lag in knob and actual tuning).
3,Good for what it costs,It is okay for strong stations and good to pack away for an emergency. It is not a great receiver but for what it costs it is a good deal. Just remember you are buying a radio that is good for an emergency receiver and one that you would not feel to badly about if it was lost on a camping trip.
4,Excellent Radio With A Low Price Tag,"The reviews were terrible, but it was eight bucks so I went for it. I'm glad I did. FM and AM reception is crystal clear. People who are complaining about FM and AM reception should be sure to read the instructions. When on the FM band the telescopic antenna should be extended. But when listening to the AM band, the antenna should NOT be extended. There is an AM/LW antenna inside the unit itself. If you extend the telescopic antenna on the AM/LW bands you will overload the frequency reception and not get the stations you want.I reduced the unit by one star because of the SW reception. I bought this radio for the SW functions but haven't had any luck with them. However, I live in a large city with many TV/radio transmitters that may be overloading the SW reception. I have a feeling that if I get an external antenna, SW radio reception will be fine. If you live in a rural area you will likely have better luck with SW reception."
3,Camry Hitch,Bolt pattern did not match exactly. Had to ream out one side of passenger side center bolt hole about 5/16 inch to make it fit. Also section that passes below muffler is only a few inches above the pavement and frequently drags when I drive over a low area. It's probably the only one you can find to fit this car so either tolerate the shortcomings or buy a pickup.
4,"Correct fit, missing pin","I am a professional auto mechanic and I had this installed on my Camry in about 15 minutes. The holes in the hitch lined up perfectly with the factory holes. I had to drill 2 holes for the 3rd and 4th left side bolts, but the u-bolt slid into the frame rail easily. I was a little ticked that the receiver pin did not have the cotter pin type clip that prevents the pin from falling out (It looked like the bag had been opened previously). Luckily I had an old clip from my last hitch, but if I didn't, I would've had to spend another $6 to get a new pin and clip. Minor setback, but It should come with all the hardware. It would've got 3 stars if I hadn't had an extra. And it would've got 5 stars if my muffler didn't rattle against the 3rd bolt on the right side. I removed that inner bolt (2 mounting bolts on the right side is enough for what I tow). It would also be very nice if it came with a plastic or rubber plug for the receiver hole. No biggie though."
3,Mounts - with work,"Not a bad hitch for light towing on my '99 Camry. As others mentioned, holes do not line up, so you had better have the tools and skills to re-work this hitch, and some patience to fit it to your vehicle."
4,Carmy receiver Hitch by Curt,"Recieved the hitch quickly and installed that evening. Hitch was shaped well for bolt-on installation, and bolt holes were almost perfect, but had to file punch ridges to get the factory bolts to line up. They were approx. 1/16"" narrower than the welded nut placement. Installed on 2005 Camry for light towing."
4,great hitch,"hitch is great. looks well made.fit and finish excellent. ease of install great. just as they said. internet video of how to do the install was very well done. was able to do it my self with no problems. oh ya,and it's made in the usa, no money leaving american soil."
3,Get what you pay for.,"Works best when stationary, gets a little sketchy when I take it running. Very light and feels ""cheap"" but I have dropped it more times then I should have already but it still works perfect.All in all I am totally satisfied for the price I paid."
2,Save Your Money,"This is really a toy, not a good radio. Make your purchase knowing that ahead of time. I gave it to the kids to play with.It is under $10.00 for a reason. If being able to clearly tune in your channels is a must, stay away."
2,Can you hear me now?,"This Radio has a cool sleek look to it but it is junk. I took it apart to try to expand the antenna but was unsuccessful because it is so small. I got this for my desk to listen to SF Giants games but it is nearly impossible because the slightest movement turns into static. Look somewhere else, you pay for what you get."
5,Great for FM and worth the money.,"This portable radio works great on my bus ride to work. Stations come in well, For less than $10 it is assume. Don't know how long it will last,probably at least 1 year. Have doped it on the sidewalk a couple of times with no damage."
2,Little Radio a disappointment,"I ordered this little radio to replace a digital one that had been damaged. While I got a good price, and the seller delivered the radio quickly, I am disappointed with the reception on this little radio. It is difficult to listen to my normal station because of the poor reception. I will probably try to find another radio that has better reception."
2,Bad Reception/Crummy Sound,"The reason I bought this radio was to take it when I walk the dog. I find that I have to constantly hold onto the radio and reposition it to keep the signal, which seems to fade out our dissolve into static every few feet. I don't know if this is from interference or what, but it is really irritating. Buy something else!"
1,What? Not even STEREO?,"That's right, So cheap it's not even good enough to be awful. NOT STEREO! Who ever even heard of a earbud type walkman radio that takes stereo phones that's NOT STEREO? Incredible. Plus COBY has 3 other similar earbud pocket radios that aren't stereo either! Even better, the Coby website states this radio IS stereo! Somebody DO SOMETHING!"
3,"Lot's of room, Less sturdy","It's huge! That's what I thought when I lifted it out of the bag. It is great but it did fall a few times. I mean, the Velcro couldn't take much weight. But if you hang it in the closet like you are supposed to on a rod, you will have little to no trouble. Listen kids if you want this big green fun toy thingy, you have to take care of it ok?"
4,"Cute, Strong, Well designed","This product is working perfectly for storing all of my daughter's stuffed animals, while saving valuable floor space - I love it! The only thing to watch out for is to hang it at such a level so that your kid will not stick their head in the hole! Of course that was the first thing she did when we hung it up ... our little product tester"
5,Great product,I was looking for a solution to organize my daughter's stuffed animals which always looked so cluttered in her room. We purchased this closet organizer and its great! It looks cute and she was really excited to put the stuffed animals in their new home. Very happy with it so far.
4,Great but poor build,"All you need to knowGreat sound quality!! Less irritating ear buds, easy cable!! Poor build, could break easily, Mine broke in two months, had to reclaim it under warranty for a newer version as these are discontinued"
5,Great Radio,"I had purchased two other ""cheap"" cb's in the $40-$50 range. Just couldn't seem to get out very far. I researched this radio and decided to go with it. What a difference it made right out of the box. It has it's own SWR meter so I can switch antenna's at will and get the best performance. It arrived quickly and was brand new as advertised!"
1,Shavers cause nics,I tried the Lady Bic shavers several times. The shaving angle causes scrapes and nics. I do not recommend these.
2,Slim or not too Slim,Was not slim enough for my pants pocket and was too tight for my credit cards unfortunately. Don't use it.
4,"Small, but still too bulky",This product is the smallest and nicest of the cases currently available for the Palm V series.....However......The Palm V was meant for the shirt pocket with the original flap cover. My cover separated at the rubber hinge after much use. I would like to find another flap cover to continue my shirt pocket use.Prolog: The Palm V allowed me to shed my leather and paper organizer. Big organizer cases for the palm therefore seem to defeat the purpose for having a Palm!
3,Executive style case with technical flaws,"The case is rich looking, padded and offers ample protection for the Palm. I received many compliments on the case. The problem lies in the railing sliding out and not locking in more securely. The second problem is that after using the Palm in my hand with the case open after 6 months, the rail seam to the case split. Perhaps if you keep the case on a flat surface when using the Palm, you might avoid the rail from ripping off the case."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this cover to protect the screen of my Palm Vx. It does that just fine and is pretty sturdy. This means it's also fairly thick -- the device with the cover on is nearly twice as thick as the device without the cover on.Another disappointment was the leather clasp. While it does keep the cover shut, the tongue part of the clasp is quite stiff and holds its same position even when the cover is open, blocking the screen, unless I force it out of the way with my pinky as I use device. This is annoying and awkward.Also, the clamshell nature of the cover means that I cannot place the Palm on its charger without removing the case, stashing it somewhere nearby and adding to the clutter on my desk.In short, I would recommend getting a flat, flap-style screen cover instead of a clamshell case, if all you're doing is carrying your Palm around in your pocket or purse, unless what I described above actually appeals to you."
4,Elegant and practical,"This slim case will give your palm quite an elegant touch. It is also lightweight and compact, and it will store your Palm, as well as some business cards and/or credit cards. I personally preffer the hard cover, which has a more modern look and protects the Palm better. Nonetheless, I use the slim leather case when I go to elegant social events because it is slimmer and less heavy, so it is easier to carry in your coat pocket."
3,"Nice case, worries about the rail","The case is a nice complement to the V and worthwhile despite concealing the V's good looks. There does appear to be one worry, the security of the fixing depends on the rail 'clicking' into the rail trail on the V. My rails does not seem to benefit from a particularly secure click. I have caught it sliding out on more than one occasion, presently a small bit of 'post it' pad is wedged in alongside the rail. This serves to tighten the fit. Also, has anyone realised, iyou put the rail fixing upside down, even if the V got loose, gravity could not grab it!"
1,Great (Until It Wears Out After Only 9 Months),"I was pretty satisfied with this case. It's slim and has somepockets for credit cards and cash. The loop closure was a negative,but livable.But after owning this case for only 9 months, it hascompletely fallen apart. The pockets are ripping away, threads arepopping out and at this point it would be embarrassing to pull thiscase out in front of friends or business associates.I've stopped towrite this review as I peruse the Amazon site looking for a newcase. Spend a little extra money and get something else. Trust me."
1,"Power turns on, rail falls off","I liked the case for the first few months. In combination with the stylus pen, it was a nice package. Six months later, I'm not so pleased. It is not very good at protecting the palm from inadvertent power-on. It also pins down the up arrow, so alarms barely sound before they're silenced. Worse than that, the rail that holds it to the case is attached with a strip of rubber that is ripping off. This is probably because the rail fit is pretty tight and the edges around where the rail inserts into the Palm are a little sharp. Taking the palm in and out of the case daily (which you need to do to sync or charge) has worn down the rubber. I'm thinking of asking for a refund."
5,Best Socks Ever,Bought my first pair in 1996 while in basic training at the United States Air Force Academy. Been wearing them since. The cushioning and the length of time it takes to wear a whole in these is unbeatable. Worth every penny.
5,Best socks ever made!,I love thes socks! They are comfortable and last forever without losing their softness or shape. I bought these to replace some that I have had for 20 years!
1,NOT SO GREAT,"I bought these socks thinking they may be like some fantastic socks that I bought in a factory outlet in Salisbury, NC when I was visiting friends there. NOT SO. These socks are totally unfinished on the inside and consequently I feel little bunches of thread bothering my toes/feet. I am sorry I donated to the troops via this outfit, because I am afraid they just aren't what they're cracked up to be (regardless of the glowing reports)."
2,Thorlo Unisex thick cushion running mini crew sock,"I wouldn't recommend this product with this price. It way too expensive. I understand it is thick and has some cushion but it shouldn't be priced at $13-14 a pair. I was wearing addidas socks that I bought at Costco for $13 (6 pairs) when I saw the promotion buy 3 get 1 free for this item. I tried it but I couldn't feel the big differences though. I end up return it. If you run or walk, I believe the insole is the different maker not the sock. I run and walk a little bit so I have a good insole and that's all I need."
5,great running sock,This is the second pair of socks I own from Thorlo they are very padded in the right areas for comfort. Excellant Socks for running.
2,Just Not Thick...Very Expensive,"These socks are reasonably comfortable, but they are only the tiniest bit thicker than the average sock. For what I paid for one pair I could have gotten a ten pack of regular socks at any big box store, but I needed cushion socks so these were a pretty big dissapointment for the price. They also twist around like crazy, so the little extra padding there is ends up on the top of my foot where I don't need it. Ok, done venting. :)"
2,Seam runs across toes,"The socks are well made and provide great cushioning, but contain a heavy seam that runs across the top and over the toes. I use the socks on three runs and experienced irritation and bleeding on all three runs. Suggest they get rid of these seams."
4,Nice sock,This sock is a new experience to wearing in a shoe with the extra cushion. The cushion is great but its like they took the top of the sock and put it on the bottom because its really thin. The price of the sock is ridiculous.
5,Great Sock,I run 10K about 4-5 times a week and I have had four pair of these socks for a couple years. They are in great shape still. I tried quite a few different smart wool running socks but after trying these I haven't wanted to look for a new running sock.
3,Solved one problem but caused big blisters.,"They got me through my marathon and solved one problem by adding a bit more cushioning along the side of my foot, but I ended up with huge blisters on/behind my big toes as the socks tended to bunch up."
1,Thorlos socks - cheap knock off,"VERY DISAPPOINTED. Seems like a cheap knock off for the same price as the real thing. If I sent it back, it would cost almost ten dollars. Expensive lesson learned. Thorlos is my favorite sock. But not these."
2,Disappointed,I had expected to recive 3 pairs of these socks not one. I had previously ordered Nike socks for a s imilar price and received 3 pairs. I expected 3 pairs of the Thorlo socks. There was nothing on your website to indicate that the quoted price was for only one pair.
1,Scoks stretched out,"I actually returned these socks, due to the fact they stretched out after wearing them one time. I bought these because I was getting blisters. Since they stretched out so much they were rubbing my heals really bad."
3,Not exactly the same as bought at sports expo,"I was given these sox when I bought a pair of running shoes at a marathon expo. I like them so much that I wanted another pair and ordered these. Although the brand and picture show the same sock, they are not exactly the same, or as good as my original pair. The cushioning isn't as plush and the fabric doesn't wick moisture away from my toes as well. If I didn't already have the pair I love, I might be less critical of them, but I won't be ordering more here."
5,Still the best running socks around,"Still the best cushioning and fit for the money. Been wearing these socks for more than 25 years. ""Nuff said""."
2,Didn't like the socks!,"Didnt' like the socks, Waiting for my return. Didn't like the socks! Didn't like the socks. didnt like the socks"
1,Disappointment,"Usually Sweeny's books are good, however this one touches on stuff that has been covered over and over. I found maybe 2 things that were semi useful.Needless to say I was completely disappointed.I wish that once in my life that I could find a Music Business book that covers fresh material.Sorry Tim but I have to pass on this one."
1,not worth it,"Not worth the money. I highly recommend you avoid this title and check out something else, like BUZZ YOUR MP3 by Brian Freeman or HOW I MAKE $100,000 by David Hooper. This just wasn't worth the money and the hype isn't worth believing. Sorry cholly."
5,Good quality - amazing price,"This foyer light is very well made. We just replaced pretty much all the lighting in our home. We bought most items at the local home improvement store, but could not find a foyer light there. Amazon to the rescue!!! Compared the the other lights we purchased, this seemed to be much better quality. It is very heavy due to thick, solid metal parts."
2,Poorly written!!,This book is very poor in the presentation of the material. The format is not easy to follow and the lay out could be improved upon! The points the author makes are valid yet the presentation lets it down!!
4,Good Choice,It was my first time buying Verbatim and they work perfectly for burning video and audio. I am glad I chose this product and will likely do so in the future.
3,When they are not defective they work,"I bought these to create recovery disks for my new laptop. The first one I inserted in the drive could not be used because it was defective. The second worked. The third was also defective. The next two worked. I have no basis for comparison with other brands but I do not consider two out of five to be acceptable reliability. The only reason I give these 3 stars is because when they work, they are OK. I chose these because they were highly rated."
2,Coasters - A - Plenty,These DVD+R DL disks failed >20% of the time! At LEAST 6 of the 30 FAILED! I tried several write speeds to no avail. I had some Fujifilm DVD+R DL disks left that wrote 100% out of 20 I had. Recommend them rather than the Verbatium! Was writing with the latest version of CloneDVD2.
4,DOUBLE LAYER WORKED GOOD FOR ME,"I recently purchased a new computer with Windows 7. I occasionally back up on disk. I've only used one of these Verbatim disks, but it worked perfectly. I had read reviews of similar products and some apparently have problems. Verbatim got the best reviews from others."
5,Perfect,"I got these in the mail right on time, because I just bought a few more games and needed to backup. I have used 8 of them so far, and only one is a coaster (but it was my fault because I knocked over my tower), so don't count that one. Don't listen to the people saying that all they get is coasters. It's their fault, not the discs."
4,Verbatim 8.5 GB recordable blu-ray discs,"These discs have been consistently reliable for problem free recording. Verbatim and Memorex blank blu-ray media are definitely my two favorite brands to use for backing up, or burning HD home movies! I always feel safe buying from Amazon. Not only can you count on quality products, but you also have reviews from others who have bought and used the products. No surprises, just guidance in making sure you're getting what you you're looking for in the product!"
1,800 mb but not on a Mac!,I tried three discs to burn via disc tools and Toast Titanium but they all crashed out mid burn. This may be the computer rather than the discs but I shall be complaining.
1,Received a bad batch! Zero Stars!,"I've tried to burn about five discs and all failed.I have a very reliable burner: LITE-ON DVDRW LH-20A1LI've notice the recording surface, the shiny surface, has many, many ""rainbowing"" distorted areas that follow the diameter of the disc from the center to the outer area. For sure this is a defect, as the surface should be mirror like, with no distortion.Very disappointed...was avoiding Memorex brand as Verbatim was supposedly a much better brand. I just threw in the trash $30.00!"
5,verbatim DL,"best i have ever used. if i get 50 all 50 work, best DL disk on the market worth the price"
5,Hands down best DL media,"Ive bought these discs for a long time since i burn xbox 360 games. Hands down the best quality and most recommended anywhere. The biggest reason, and also of course the most important, is the lack of times these will error out on you. You want to be pissed go by some cheap kodak brand DL discs and watch as you throw more than half of those pos discs away. Anyways not to get side tracked but yes these cost more than a lot but you pay for the great quality. I used to get these at Frys electronics but the store is just horrible, customer service, theres never one really close to you, and they constantly had them out of stock. Ordering off amazon simplifies the whole thing and i just wait to get them at my door for about the same price as in store."
5,Good discs,I have not burned any coasters using these discs yet. I would purchase these again if needed. I have not had any problems with Verbatim discs at all yet.
2,Read,Disks are packaged in a strong container and thy arrived to me in perfect conditon however its about a 1:3 ratio of quality. there is an error on the third disk half the time. Meaning out of the 15 in the package about 5 disks while burning an error occured and i gained myself a coaster. When it works however the speed is great and quality is also good.
3,Failed Disks,"I was trying to make copies of dual layer 8.5 GB disks. Should be no problem, right?Well, it could have been a software related issue, but a successful copy was so rare after the first five tries (two out of five) I decided to give up and send them all back for a refund.Happily, I was refunded my money.I won't buy them again, however. Not unless I'm sure my software can handle it and the disks are OK."
1,First time using this was complete ( DISASTER ),"I was forewarned about the outcome results about this product.What a waste of time & ( money )paying a premium sum for non-productive results.Over 75% of these disc were completely usless.I was totalaly LIVID because of such a waste, I went back to Memorex & SONY Nooooooooooo Problem. Spending HOURS REchecking all connections , Diagnostic testing ,Compressed-Air cleaning ,Checking service manuals , final conclusion(malfunction product).NEVER AGAIN!"
4,Unlucky,"2 out of the 5 turned into coasters. That's a horrible odd in my opinion, but I've been suspecting that my DVD Writter is going south for some time. I've never had any problems with any Verbatim product, so I'm going to take only one star off since there is always the chance that it was indeed the medias fault."
1,Won't even play on my player,I apparently wasted my money on these. The program I used to burn them works fine and they seem to burn o.k. but they won't even play on my player so I wasted $30.00 on these. My fault I guess. I thought they were compatable with most players...maybe they are but they wouldn't play on mine. Live and learn.
1,Junk Discs - Not good for 360,"These are cheap discs, and you are bound to get bad burns for these. And absolutely do NOT try to burn xbox 360 games with these. Thank god for Amazon returns!"
4,they work as they should,"They did what they said they would do. I didn't have any bad dvd's, they all burned without any issues. The price was alright. I hardly buy them so when I do I happy they all worked."
1,kinda sucked,there not from singapore didnt work for my needs more than half didnt wok at all !!! realy disapointing! avoid!
3,50/50,"The first time I bought this, no problem, all of the discs worked and recorded well. This time, only about half of them have been willing to write at all, and of those, I keep encountering errors -- 2 discs, so far, out of 5 successfully written, have had errors that made them next to unusable. I'm disappointed and uncertain whether I'll purchase again."
4,So far so good,"The reason I didn't give them five stars is because I haven't burned many movies yet, but with other inferior brands I got coasters right off the bat. You pay a little more for the Verbatim brand but if you count the money you loose on coasters with the cheaper brands you probably come out ahead. And yes I did get the ones made in Singapore which are much touted by other reviewers here on Amazon."
5,Super DVD,"I have two burners, Liteon and LG and I get excellent burns using Verbatim media. No drink coasters."
5,sweet,I've had great success with the Verbatim dvd-dl. I use them primarily for copying movies(back ups). This is a great product and a very good price.
5,Incredible Product,"These discs worked perfectly. I am not an expert at copying dvds, and read other reviews on other products and noted that some of them were duds. Every dvd in this package copied perfectly. I am very happy with the product and would buy it again!"
4,Backing up some dual layered DVDs,"Having a 3 year old in the house who doesn't quite how to handle DVD's can be frustrating at times. Instead of paying $20 and having it become a coaster and then him wanting it again and spending another $20, I copy the DVD, put the original DVD away, and let him watch the copy. When it gets destroyed, I make another one. Eventually, he will learn to take care of them, but until then, it's a great way to keep his newer DVD's intact."
5,Verbatim Double Layer Recordable Media.,I started out using a familiar brand of Double Layer Recordable media with AWFUL results. This is a brand a lot of stores like Office Depot and Staples love to sell. They were absolute crap! I would estimate 40% of the discs ended up as coasters due to burn errors and the successful burns I never fully trusted. I have yet to have a single burn error from the Verbatim discs. Verbatim Double Layers cost a bit more but are well worth the extra cost.
4,Works so far.,"Been through 5 discs in the spindle, and so far, no bad burns. I've been burning at only 8x however, the highest I can go with my burner."
5,Great discs!,I needed a large double layer disc to burn and this did the trick! Love that each disc has 8.5gb with no need to flip it!
4,Will they burn on my HP Notebook drive?,"Would really like to buy these due to xtra GB's however, I don't know if my HP pavillion dv6-1352dx will let me burn DL's. Does anyone know?I've been all over on hp official website (& manual) & other websites to see if my notebook can use DL's and no answers or info has been stated. Yes, frustrated cuz I don't want to buy expensive DL's if my driver won't write to them. If you know about notebooks/pc's, esp my question, I'd be ever so grateful if someone could help with my question. Thanks!!!Update: I ended up purchasing these discs without knowing if I could write to them. My HP plays and writes to DL's which I'm DELIGHTED about along with Amazon's speedy free delivery!!! Altho it only allows 7.96kb (vs 8.0-8.5kb), it will be nice to use these vs 4.7kb's for various functions of using discs. I haven't had an opportunity to try using disc I burned in my std VCR player, hoping it works based on reading the comments. Thank you for the comment(s) and feedback."
5,quality discs,I have purchased 3 of these dual layered dvd packages & none have been bad I have copied many various types of data to them .The quality is TOP NOTCH if you need a dvd with extra file space try these you won't be disappointed.
5,**THEY WORK GREAT!!**,"After 2 coasters with preloaded SW I downloaded Nero Burning ROM 10 and FINALLY **VOILA** success!! The software you use appears to make a HUGE difference. Yeah, they are more expensive but better that they do work then buy cheaper and get more or all coasters!! I also changed my review from a 4 to a 5 star as it's not the disk's fault if the burning SW is lousy - I have not had a bad burn since I changed to Nero 10 - the downside is the download is only good for 15 days, so if anyone reads this and has any suggestions for me please do let me know... PS - I bought more Verbatim 8.5's here at Amazon.com & got an even better deal!!"
4,the best i've found,"these discs are the only dual layer discs i buy. it's true that they are more expensive than others but when you consider the failure rate of other brands, these are cost effective. i use DL dvd-r to back up xbox 360 games and verbatim are the only brand i've found that consistently work on that platform."
5,You get what you pay for!,"I do a lot of DVD burning, I won't mention any competitors all I will say is that I NEVER have had a Verbatim disk fail on me. If it fails its usually my fault. I have had great success with the Verbatim +R DL disks."
5,Best discs out there,Best discs to use when backing up your old dvd's ( don't pirate ). I have yet to have a verbatim disc fail.
5,None better.,The best Dual Layer discs period. I burn files and never have any issues with them. All my friends use these for Xbox 360 Game Backups never have any issues with them.
5,"Not bad, just a little pricey","Basically, here's what you need to know. These DVD's are great in every way except one: they are slightly easier to scratch than most. But if you take good care of your discs, then that shouldn't be a problem. And obviously, they are a little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for. If you need more than 5GB, this is the way to go."
5,Never A Bad Disc,"I've yet to have a Verbatim DVD+R DL disc fail to record. I've tried to record DVD's using cheep Dual Layer Discs and it doesn't pay. The Cheep Dual Layer discs who shall remain nameless (Memorex) have such a high failure rate that they are not worth the cost savings. Accordingly, I have two Dual Layer recorders and the discs fail on both machines. Who knows what the durability of these discs may be as well.As I've stated; ""I've yet to have a Verbatim DVD+R DL disc fail to record""I bought my last Verbatim 30 pack at a cost of approximately $1.00 @ disc from Amazon. If you've ever shopped Verbatim you'll know this is an awesome price for DVD+R DL discs.How many times have you heard ""you get what you pay for""Well, I learned my lesson. Again!Best Wishes, Mitch"
4,Good choice for your DL discs,"I have a Samsung 12x BD-ROM/DVD Lightscribe Writer. I had purchased a HP single layer 50-pak spindle, then I thought I should try the Lightscribe function, so I go the HP Lightscribe single layer 25-pak. After trying to copy / backup some DVD vidoe discs, I realize most of them require more than 4.7GB, or a double layer disc.I've got this spindle instead other brands, including HP, because of the good reviews. Even though this is not the best price per disc (such as the 50-pak DL discs from Memorix), but I prefer not to make coasters. I've burned 5 discs so far and it's a 100% success rate.I give it 4 stars, and I highly recommend it! (Not five because of the price)"
5,Happy,"I think this is the best kind of disk of its erra, and I have bought many since I use them to sell call of duty world at war and modern warfare 2 ISO disks on rightburn.com. Check out my site if you are looking for these disks for iso reasons, because my site can sell you an iso you are considering to make for MUCH less then it costs to make one. :)"
4,Excellent!! It works as expected. Worthy of cost. Only recording speed 4x,Excellent!! It works as expected. Worthy of cost. Only recording speed as 4x instead of 8x - 10x as it mentioned in the spec. I'm given 4 * in it.
2,Very hit and miss on imacs,"I've been trying to burn copies of my wedding onto DVD and haven't had much luck with this brand. Out of 25 discs, only about 7-8 burned successfully on my imac. The other ones gave me a failed burn message with either a medium write error or a disc failed to verify error. The TDK brand seems to work better for me but I guess it depends on your machine. It's a shame because it's a lot of money being wasted on experimenting with brands."
1,first 4 off the stack are coasters,"Finished up my previous spindle of Verbatim +R DLs this weekend and ordered this one to finish up the job.Turns out it's a spindle of crap. First four are 100% coasters. 1st disk didn't error on burn, but doesn't produce anything useful. next 3 all errored during the burn. (quad core mac pro w/ stock superdrive) 8x, 6x, 4x, 2.x4 (slowest I can go) are all failures.Sigh."
5,Burned through 20 of these AWESOME discs!,"These were such a good price on Amazon, I bought four boxes!I just finished burning through them today. NOT ONE COASTER. YAY.I love these. I'm ordering MORE. I wish they sold them by the case.I'm using my Sony DRX-840u to burn on these.LOVE THESE. I'm ordering more and more :)"
5,DVD-R DL,"This is a great source for storing presious data, videos and all that your heart desires. I am very pleased with these DVD's."
3,Basic informaion of growing fruit & nuts,"This is a good book for those wanting very basic information on planting, propagating, caring for, & harvesting the fruit of the trees. More detailed information is given on citrus & exotic fruits as well as on a few nut varieties.Several gadgets that can be used to make caring for the tree easier are also listed along with places to get them. There is also a small but delicious recipe section as well as planting & apple-tasting record templates.There is great chart that explains how to organically fix or prevent many diseases & pests that can injure your trees. Another chart lists zones, chill hours, height, pollinator & susceptibilities for about 16 trees.A bibliography & many associations where you can find information on growing specific trees are also included. Information on where to buy trees is as well as a list of tree museums is a nice bonus."
5,Great Product,"This item is just what I was looking for, I don't understand why the local stores don't carry these .... Why would I pay double the price for the same quality item.... Thanks"
5,Just as good as non-recycled regular napkins,"I've been switching my house to a ""green"" and ""organic"" home. I've been through various types of paper products, and the recycled stuff tends to rate low. I tried two of the Green Forest products--bathroom tissue and napkins--and both are very, very good. The bathroom tissue is actually soft and ""normal"" (unlike Seventh Generation) and the napkins are like regular ones you get (not the premium, but everyday).You can use these recycled napkins with confidence.One hopes eventually the price on recycled paper products will be more affordable. But for now, I'm willing to pay a bit more to be earth-conscious, and Green Forest is getting it right (so far).Mir"
5,Way You Move by Outkast,"This CD single has 5 different versions of the song ""Way You Move"" by Outkast."
5,AWESOME overlooked classic,"Great film, funny, entertaining, great cast, has one of the top 5 car chase scenes in movie history, IMO. Where's the DVD!?"
4,Funny DVD,"Funny DVDFunny DVD, I had the VHS version and needed to upgrade to the DVD version. The quality was good and it met my expectations."
3,It is alright,I like watching some of these older films for bits and pieces of how life was viewed when it came out. The video was entertaining.
5,Dabney Coleman Shines !!,"C'mon Movie Studio execs ........ ""Can't you guys do anything right !!"" Re-release this out on DVD PLEASE !! For ""Dougie's"" sake !!"
3,Too many ingredient lists!!!,"I like the show and was interested in the book but have to say I was disappointed, mainly at the long ingredient lists for most of the recipes within. Plus I found it hard to believe there couldn't have been more of a variety of desserts offered that were 'cooked thin'. Her recipes seem abit far fetched in most cases and from the one, yes one recipe, that I tried it tasted like a diet recipe and it doesn't have to!There was alot in the book about health and nutrition that is helpful but as a cookbook, I felt it lacked in the practical. I can't purchase oodles of ingredients for one recipe; I rather having several items on hand. Sorry, Kathleen!"
5,Another great collection of recipes from Kathleen!,"I love Kathleen's no-nonsense, no-off-limits-food, get-moving, eat-well approach to diet and exercise. I've lost 50 pounds in a year, and am using this book to get the next 50 pounds off. Her approach works and tastes great. I am not a food weigher, calorie counter kind of person, and her books don't require that. I also like that she includes recipes for foods that are tasty and so relatively low in calories that if you eat the entire 4 servings, you haven't derailed your diet forever. Some of my favorites in this book so far are the white bean and roasted red pepper salad, the apple/celery/pecan salad, the tabbouleh, and her orange-raisin breakfast bars. If you loved the first book and are looking for some similarly fantastic, high flavor, healthy recipes you will like this book!"
4,Getting Thin and Loving Food,"I really like this book. It's simple to follow instructions, and there is good advice all the way thru it. Everything from the author's mom's advice to what to do to jazz up a low fat, high flavor recipe to make it more flexible, tastier, or fancy enough for company. I like KD's tv show on Food tv, and I liked her first book, this book is better than the first. I am eating more healthfully(Is that a word?) and keep taking the small steps KD recommends to keep doing even better. I highly recommend the book."
3,An OK test prep supplement,"i read this thing like a Bible for the course at least three times before the test, starting 2 or 3 weeks before i had to take the test. the book bragged that you need not study anything else but it. however.... there were many things on the test that were not in the book. so, my advice is... use this book only as a supplement to help you study, not as a course manual because they do NOT ""know what's on the test"" any more than any other test prep company who publishes an AP Euro book. But, I'd still have to say that this is a pretty good test prep overall...I had a friend that bought the Test Prep for AP European History from the ""Research and Education Association"" and found it very very in depth and helpful. I'd try that one.The Barron's book is only good for the review questions at the end of every section, but lacks in good detailed description.Good Luck"
2,Did not fit,"These did not fit in the label maker I had for it. I've had them too long, so it's too late to return them."
4,Women's Invicta Morgan Diver Two-Tone,"Nice product. Looks refined but a touch sporty. Band is not as solid as I was hoping, but still seems to be of good quality. Amazon's listed retail price seems quite inflated as the actual price tag on the merchandise was listed as less. But, since I purchased it on sale, with an additional % off, it was a good bargain for a Swiss timepiece."
1,not a good watch,"i brought this watch in december for gift, and the person has use it only several week and the crown( the black and red part from the top) of the watch has fall apart. very bad product."
5,Outstanding Book,You will not be disappointed. It is lavishly and beautifully illustrated and printed. The text is clear and concise. It doesn't cover the basics of Polaroid transfer but then it doesn't claim to.
1,Sharp speakers live up to their name,"Sharp was and is a good brand,and the speakers live up to their name Sharp"
5,Very powerful and moving!,About eight years ago in Junior High School our drama teacher had us preform this play. The poems these children wrote were so powerful you couldn't help but cry. I never forgot that play and what those children went through. This is an excellent play! It helped me understand the Holocaust better than any text book could.
5,So Moving!,This play reminds me of my senior year in high school. Our drama club performed this play for OAP. District Champs! I played the father. I loved this play!
4,True to Life,"In his novel, HER DADDY'S EYES, Gary Parker pens a realistic story of one woman's quest to bring closure and healing to the circumstances surrounding her father's absence. In the midst of planning a wedding, Allie begins a journey to find her dad, which creates tension with her fiance. The adventure leads her to another handsome young man who happens to be a Christian and who sticks with her as she searches, answering questions about his faith along the way. An easy, well-crafted read. Eileen Rife, author of RESTORED HEARTS, Book Two, Born for India trilogyRestored Hearts"
3,Her Daddy's Eyes,"As her wedding approaches, Allie discovers an old picture of her father, a man who abandoned herself and her mother after returning home from Vietnam. Over her mother's and fiancee's objections, Allie feels compelled to try and find the man, and at least get some sense of closure. Her quest leads her to Chase, a young man who considers her dad to be an uncle of the heart, and whose parents hold the key to Allie's past. Chase may be the key to her future. It becomes clear rapidly that he is a believer, something Allie has never really been. She is as curious to know more about Chase's faith as about him. Is she prepared to pay the cost of truth?*** This book effectively delivers both a good story and good message. The witness and sense of destiny conveyed in this novel are subtle and profound. The message is not overly preachy, but it is effective. It would be a great gift from a believer to an unsaved friend. ***"
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"THE TREE THAT WAS SHIPPED WAS NOT WHAT WE ORDERED - THE MANUFACTURE CALLED SANTA'S OWN DOES NOT HAVE GOOD COMMUNICATION WITH CUSTOMERS - IN FACT, NO ACTUAL PERSON HAS EVER ANSWERED THE PHONE AT SANTA'S OWN- NOR DO THEY RETURN CUSTOMER MESSAGES LEFT ON THERE VOICE MAIL. THE TREE WE ORDERED WAS THE CARRIBEAN BLUE AND SANTA'A OWN DID SHIP THE BOX THAT HAD THE PART # OF THE CARRIBEAN BLUE... HOWEVER UPON OPENING THE BOX THE TREE WAS THE ""TEAL BLUE"" (BAIT & SWITCH ROUTINE)----- CLEARLY NOT THE COLOR I ORDERED - AND WHEN YOU CALL SANTA'S OWN NO SINGLE LIVE PERSON CARES TO ANSWER OR RETURN MY MESSAGES - THE TREE IS GREAT - JUST NOT MY ORDER !"
4,My first Diana Palmer,I was given this book by a friend. I had never read Diana Palmer before.This book got me hooked. A good escape book.
5,Quick delivery of infielder glove that delivers assists and putouts.,"My grandson the teen-age infielder says this is the best glove for an infielder. He loves it. His teammates agree it is the best. Good for catching the ball, with sure and easy extraction to make the quick throw. Would be good for pitchers and outfielders, also. Delivery from seller to grandson was very swift."
1,Does not fit 2002 Civic Si,"Despite assurance that this blade fits the windshield on the passenger side, 2002 Civic Si, the additional plastic mounting clip required to fit the blade frame to the wiper arm was incorrect so that the wiper blade could not be mounted. I'll have to buy another blade. Interestingly, the 24 in version of the same blade did come with the appropriate plastic clip and it fit perfectly on the driver side. Zero stars. Unusable product."
2,not good,"on web site it said it supports the model of my car, but after I got it, I could not install, it is missing one of the pin needed for my car model. I ened up to buy another brand."
4,They work fine...,These work great! They are on our 1998 Ford Escort Station Wagon. No complaints. They're just wipers for goodness sake!
1,31-16 Does NOT fit on 2005 Prius rear window,"I bought this specific windshield wiper because I was specifically informed by Amazon that this wiper Anco 31-16 would fit my 2005 Prius rear window. It does NOT. The arm on the Prius to which it attaches is too wide for this blade. I know what you're thinking, and nope, even if I remove the rubber blade itself from the arm, it will not thread into the arm on the Prius because the rubber blade and metal rods are too wide. Fail Amazon. Interestingly, I hadn't noticed that other folks wrote the same review as I just did. Fail Me. I could have saved myself the trouble. I will be sending this blade back for a refund and ordering ""Trico 16-A Exact"" instead per another helpful reviewer."
1,Doesn't fit Odyssey Van,"I purchased the product to replace a rear wiper blade on a 2005 Odyssey van, the product did not fit the van."
3,didn't fit my car,I own a 2000 Subaru Outback wagon. I order these for the front and rear of my car. The fronts 22 and 20 work great but the rear did not. They didn't have the correct size so I order one inch bigger. The rear wiper arm makes contact with the wiper. Maybe a size smaller would work better but I will try a different brand with a smaller profile.
1,"Anco 31 Series 3116 Wiper Blade 16""","NOT FOR 2004 TOYOTA SIENNA.Nextday went to AutoZone to get exact wiper blade.Anco 31 Series 3116 Wiper Blade - 16"""
1,NOT FOR 2006 Honda Odyssey Rear Wiper Replacement,"The ""one star"" rating is due to the fact that Amazon confirms this part to fit the rear wiper assembly for a 2006 Honda Odyssey... FALSE! Be aware that the size is correct (16"" or 400mm equivalent), however, it will not attach to the rear wiper arm.Another reviewer mentioned they forced it on (no idea how they managed that, as I tried and stopped when the plastic base was about to snap.I have two recommendations:1) Do not rely on Amazon to tell you whether it fits your car or not.2) Go to your local Honda dealership and pick up an OEM refill (will cost you around $6 and you can easily put it on yourself)."
1,2005 Volvo XC70 rear wiper...not,"Amazon says this fits a 2005 Volvo XC70 rear wiper arm, but it has a completely different attachment system- so not even close. Very annoying."
4,Good windshield wiper,These windshield wipers are good economy wipers. I've used them on my vehicles for years in northern Ohio. They seem to last about 2-3 months working really well. They can last up to 6 months or a year even if you can deal with little streaks. They are not top of the like though. But you could buy 2 or 3 of these for every 1 nice one. And it seems to me that 2 ok wipers are better than one nice one.
4,Good value,"I have used these the past couple years, replacing about every six months. They do a fine job for a low price. I was buying much more expensive blades and noticed only a small difference in quality. These are worth their price, and inexpensive enough to replace when needed."
3,5 Tier Hanging Mesh Storage will do,"5 Tier Hanging Mesh Storage will help hold my little girls stuffed animals just fine, thank you for your prompt service."
1,"Pretty razors, but they nick and cut your skin","I was fooled into purchasing these by the slick packaging design, the pretty colors and the promise of lavender scented handles. I naively thought the fact that they each had triple blades would cut down my shaving time to 1/3 the time. Instead, I felt trapped in the shower with a pretty little razor that had no intentions of getting rid of hair, but instead, wanted to chew off the skin of my legs by nicking and scratching no matter how slowly or delicately I handled it.Save your money and purchase another razor."
2,Unless you like pain stay away!,"I am a very cautious shaver - I really go slowly and take care since I hate cuts. No matter what I do these shavers cut at least 3 times. Oddly enough they also dull quickly - which makes shaving hazardous even more. I don't see a big difference, other than weight and heavier plastic, between the actual razor part on this and the cheap razors. Given that I won't purchase these again. I recommend you look elsewhere as well given the cost."
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS! BEWARE!,"These razors are THE. WORST. RAZORS. I. HAVE. EVER. USED. IN. MY. LIFE.I literally have SCARS from them. I take my time when i shave, I'm always careful. That doesn't matter with these. They will tear you up! BEWARE!"
1,Use at your own risk!,"I agree with the other reviewers when they say these razors cut up your skin pretty good. With the first use, everything was going pretty well. I got down to my ankle and it literally cut a one-and-a-half inch strip of my skin like a potato peeler. Blood was everywhere! It is still fleshy a few days later :( --Sorry about the grotesque imagery, but understand that I just don't want this to happen to you. Bic should stick to pens; I'll stick to Venus or any other razor I can find."
4,Three old girl loves this toy.,"My three year old daughter loves this doll and will sit down with her and brush her hair. She never would play with baby dolls until I bought this doll. For one week straight, she would not put the doll down. I recommend this item to all children."
4,Insightful Predictions,An excellent read. Their blunt candor in this era of obfuscation is refreshing. The insights and predictions certainly provide food for thought.
5,The King of all Grease Guns! !,This is a Professional Grease Gun built like a tank! The convenient Air-Bleeder Valve makes loading a snap! Full range lever sensitivity for tight spots! This is a 30-Year tool; just holding it you can tell that it's very well made and built to last. Not a Toy!!!!
2,"Great workout, unpleasant narrative","I have quite a few Pilates DVD's and I try to rotate them so that I get a well-rounded workout. I always dread this one because the narrative is irritating. Rael seems to micromanage your breathing and every movement. Rael, you don't have to talk constantly. Silence is good for peace and concentration. We only need to hear a directive once or twice to know what to do. I don't recommend this DVD since there are plenty of other rigorous workouts without the annoying narrative."
4,Rael Pilates: System 27,"I'm a big fan of Rael. This is a good instructional video. It's not one to really work out to on a regular basis as the pace is slow for more advanced practioner. Rael gives a lot of good cues and insight into the movment. The instructor/models are amazing. Beautiful, graceful bodies. Nothing too difficult, good modifications."
4,Not for the faint of heart,"I really like this workout video. It leaves me feeling both physically and mentally relaxed, which is what a good workout should do. Rael Pilates is a thorough and comprehensive pilates workout. Rael provides effective form cues for the most part but for some reason never explains the Pilates stance with hips rotated externally. I like how he provides a few minutes of warmup and incorporates some yoga moves such as down dog and child's pose. Be aware that there are some advanced Pilates exercises, which if you are beginning you may want to skip."
3,"Good sound quality, not very reliable","This adapter has excellent sound quality with very little 'fuzziness.' However, if you have had issues with your tape deck rejecting adapters in the past, I would not recommend this product. The magnetic strip is narrow, which may decrease the volume level or the sound quality. For some tape deck adapters, (particularly older ones) the narrow strip may not align properly with the reader in your tape deck, and the adapter will be rejected after a few seconds of playing time.I enjoy internet shopping as much as the next guy, but tape deck adapters are something that should be bought at a retail location to ensure you get one that will work with your tape deck."
5,"Good Quality, Good Price, and Great Features","This is the second tape adapter I've bought (the first was crushed by my car) But from my experience I would recommend this tape adapter to anyone. The cord attaches with a special changeable plug so that the tape can be loaded in two orientations(a very ingenious design) The tape provides good sound and doesn't feel flimsy or of weak construction. I had my previous adapter for about a year before I crushed it and I had no complaints. Cons: The cord length is on the short side if you want to extend it more than 3-5 ft. But if you want it for use in a car or close proximity, no problem."
2,you get what you pay for,"It does the job and sounds good. My stereo doesn't always know what to do with it and usually ejects it a couple of times before I can get it to work. It makes a funny sound when it's trying and can't figure it out what to do. I've tried other adapters and had a little more success, I know it's a older stereo but this is a cheap adapter and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless your short on cash and plan to never eject it. Perhaps I got a faulty one but coby isn't exactly known for quality."
4,tape adapter and auto reverse,"I have an auto-reverse tape deck in my car. After reading the review (March 27, 2007) telling me how to alter the adapter to work in my car, I bought it. You don't actually need to remove any gears, just tape down the piece that the moves back and forth. It works great - a huge improvement over any FM adapter I've tried!"
2,Some Re-design is in order,"This item does what it is supposed to in the sense that a CD player, or MP3 player can be heard through the car radio. In my case, when inserting the adapter into the tape player it activated the tape transport mechanism and the mechanical parts in the adapter made a lot of noise. Consequently, I tossed it as it was not worth the trouble to return."
1,Clicking and Whistling,"I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2. The car makes a lot of noise in any case, so I'm not holding out for audio lab quality. However, the product made a quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me. I'm trying out the offering from Philips next..."
3,works great but sound quality not too great,"This worked quite easily in my car (hooked it up to my samsung epic), but the sound quality is not as good, it is not clear and sharp. Not sure if sound quality is a limitation due to it being through a cassette player though. (Honestly can't remember when I last used cassettes)."
3,Pretty good,"It Gets a little better quality than a normal tape but, it's far from CD Quality. It is still avery good deal for a really good price"
3,You get what you pay for,"When I first bought my adapter, it worked as I wanted it to-it played music. But then it started acting up. My cassette player in my truck would switch the tape from side one to side two repeatedly. This made it impossible to listen to a song. Also on occasion the vocals wouldn't come through in the audio and I would be left with instrumental versions of songs.If I was going to buy another adapter I would probably drop a few extra dollars and get a higher quality adapter."
1,Wouldn't Purchase Again,"The sound quality was very average, the gears inside were making a little noise that I could hear over the audio, and worst of all every minute or 2 it would eject the tape portion of the unit. This required me to insert it again. Once again, 1-2 minutes later it would eject itself again. After about 10 minutes I tried it in a different tape player. The same thing happened. I purchased this item with expedited delivery and received it the day I was leaving town for a week. That being the case I went and purchased a different brand from a local store and its been functioning very well with no issues. Now I have to waste my time to return the unit to Amazon for only a few dollars. Not really worth my time."
3,Worked... then didn't,"I loved this product when I first recieved it. It worked awesome for the first two months I owned it, then it just stopped. My car's tape deck started ejecting it randomly. I was able to fix it once or twice by hitting rewind on my tape controls, but then it just kept ejecting it over and over again. I tried my girlfriend's tape deck player in my car and it worked fine, so I know it's not my car. Oh well, luckily it's not too expensive, but I don't plan on buying another."
4,Review,"Its a good product, plays music and everything I wanted it to, it makes a small noise by the cassette gears moving but nothing to throw a fuss about with a product like this, fast delivery"
3,Stops a lot.,It took me a little while to figure out how to work it and now it will randomly stop working and the tape will come out. I have to quickly push the tape button when it cuts out before it spits the tape out. It's annoying but when it's in it does work just fine. So I guess I'll just deal with it.
3,Temperamental,"I bought this cassette while living in new york city and I couldn't help but notice that whenever it was bitter cold outside (like 24F) the cassette will keep coming out, it was very frustrating and annoying but once the wintertime was over it kept doing it now and then. Sound quality wasn't the best but it was ok and all in all I got rid of it as soon as I could upgrade my stereo and replaced it for a USB adapter that plays my music and charges my phone, it doesn't get any better."
4,Does it's job and priced well,"We bought this so we could easily play our iPods over the speakers while we moved across the country. It worked great and we had no problems. Some people complained about the quality of sound, but what do you expect when your transmitting it through the tape deck? Cassette tapes never had great quality to begin with. This was very easy to use and definitely got us through many long hours of driving."
4,Works OK,Works ok with my car stereo player. No issues as of now. price of this product is now doubled.
1,Save your money and your time!,"It's junk. It doesn't work. Simple as that. Only played one channel of mp3 player through car cassette deck. Like most products from this manufacturer, it's crap. Got it yesterday, tried it today, will return it tomorrow. Thank god for amazon's easy return policy!"
1,Junk,Coby CA-747 Dual Position CD/MD/MP3 Cassette AdapterI bought this to replace a Jensen that the cord went bad on. I placed it into my cassette player and the wheels spun and the cassette player spit it out. I became so frustrated that I threw it into the garbage can!
2,not too happy about it,It doesn't work with old cassettes meaning 10 years old dating back to 1998 but works great on new cars I ended up getting a used sony which works great. sony is the way to go.
1,"Click, Click, Click","The Coby adaptor did a good job of transporting music through my car's FM radio. However, there is some sort of mechanical problem with it that caused it to click every second or two. It wasn't worth having."
5,It works great!,This is the first and only cassette stereo adapter I have had. It works great. The sounds quality is very good. And it is inexpensive and easy compared to installing a new stereo. I have a great stereo but it does not have an input or MP3 connection. I use this to connect my MP3 player or my jukebox for longer trips. I have had it now for a month or so and I recommend it.
5,Great device,I had to make my car volume louder but it worked perfectly fine. It even ejected itself when my car was getting too hot to avoid damage.
1,Deficient,"Failed to work, had to spend time to send back. Bought one at Walamart for less money and it is still working."
3,Coby CA-747 Dual Position CD/MD/MP3 Cassette Adapter,"I should've given this product 2 stars but i guess it's pretty ok. I bought this item about 3 weeks ago. It had better sound quality than the cassette adapter i was using before. After using it for only a couple weeks, it stopped working properly. I was listening to my mp3 player through the adapter and it just suddenly stopped. I used my finger, trying to spin the cassette's teeth but felt that there was a little bit of friction. Because of the friction, the tapedeck couldn't spin the teeth causing it to stop. The problem still persist."
1,Didn't work with my Toyota Camry!,I bought this to fit it in my Toyota Camry V6. i couldn't make it to work with my tape system at all. I returned this item and Amazon was prompt with the refund.
5,Works Great with XM Radio,I bought this to replace my broken Roady 2 cassette adapter. It works better than the one that came with my car kit.Highly recommend it.
1,garbage,"at under 8 buck it seemed like a good deal, but this cassette adapter broke after 15 minutes of use. in the time it took me to leave my house and drive halfway to school the gears inside had dismantled. i guess you get what you pay for: overpriced garbage."
3,Happy about it...,I am quite happy about it..so folks told that this may create a noise once at time of playing in the player..but I never felt so..hope it will create in future...I recommend this to all....
1,Dont buy it it will only last a day or 2,This item is a piece of junk it worked 1 day and i bought 2 of them and both lasted maybe 6 hrs then quit working i waisted ten dollars on them and im not going to buy to much more from amazon because i made another purchase of a webcamera that worked 2 days and now is junk another 6 dollars waisted and no one cares when you send somthing telling them about it avoid amazon there is a lot on junk being sold and they dont care.
2,Doesn't work Suburban,This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players.
2,a waste of my time and money!!,"I have been trying to make this thing work since it was delivered to me. I read the instructions and tried to change the plug for the thing to just stay in the player, but to no evail it keeps spitting out the cassette. I have moved on trying to find an adapter that will work for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good at first--but dies quickly.,"This adapter is sub-par at best in terms of the performance I have received while using it. At first, the adapter worked like a charm . It was quiet, without static, and adjusted just fine to changing volume.However, after about a month and a half, the adapter started to interrupt itself, cutting out and grinding audibly, even occasionally forcing itself to eject from the tape player. It still works somewhat, but its overall durability leaves something to be desired and it is only a matter of time before the thing completely dies.I should note that I did try to take the precautions listed in the adapter manual. I did not leave the adapter in the cassette player while not in use, and was careful with it.My bottom line: you're gambling if you buy this adapter. Maybe it will last. Maybe it won't."
1,Very Bad product,This product has stopped working within 2 weeks of my purchase and it is of very bad quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,cheap product,Didn't work very well. Kinda sounded like listening to the radio in a bad area. Came in good physical condition though. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Poor Durability,"I purchased this product in October of 2011. It worked well for about 3 months. After which, the sound quality rapidly became worse and worse. It stopped working completely at around the 6 month mark."
4,Eh..,"This is more about the manufacturing than the company. It is dual sided, so the cassette player keeps trying to change sides and when it does, the music stops. It happens over and over and very annoying. But this is probably due to the way the item was made, not the storefront's fault! Most likely there needs to be some way for the cassette itself to block the automated thing that plays both sides. Since that is not new technology I'd have expected more from Coby. Other than that, great price and fast shipping. The days it works properly it has excellent sound. I have gotten a lot of good use out of it despite the issues, and well it's worth the price, and shouldn't cause someone with a non-dual cassette player any problems at all."
3,It depends on the vehicle,"We have two cars. In the one this works perfectly; in the other it constantly causes the tape deck to switch ""sides"" and then it stops working. I tried various lubricants, I tried taking it apart and removing certain inner gears to change how much friction it generates. Nothing helped. In the one car it works perfectly and would earn 5 stars. In the other it has never worked well and would earn 1 star. So I averaged at 3. I wish I could say what the difference is, but I do not know."
4,Good for the price.,I was going to buy an adapter from walmart- but the only one they had was $15. I took a chance on amazon and found this item which was about what I was looking to pay for anyways.When plugged in it became static-y when the wire is moved. I assume it might last 6 months more- but the more expensive ones only last 1.5 years- so i still think this is a better deal.
3,Great for the money... but buy a couple!,"These things have been around forever, and while I have seen units for a lot more, I felt this unit was decent for the money, BUT after about 6 months it started acting up and I would have to mess with it to get it to work, which isnt fun when you are using the thing to talk on the phone! Its a mechanical device and is subject to wear and failure, but I would have liked to see it last longer. I would actually buy it again since it is cheap, but I know that it wont last forever... (so buy 2)"
3,Great - On a Temp Basis,"I have had trouble finding a long-lasting cassette adapter. When I went with Coby, I thought I finally found the right one. On a positive note, it is the one that didn't begin ejecting right away. That's what made me believe that I found the one. But the problem develops later. After a month or two, I come across a problem with each of these that I purchase."
1,Broke in less than 2 months and Amazon doesn't seem to care,"Do not buy this. It is cheap and works when you first get it, but then it will break completely and not work at all. And to top it all off, Amazon's customer service department doesn't seem to care that they are selling a product that breaks with less than two months of use. They told me that I couldn't return it and I couldn't get a replacement. Horrible customer service. Do not bother to buy this because it will just break and then amazon will refuse to let you return it. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and with Amazon's customer service."
3,Good for a Year,"It works for me, but for the price, I really wasn't expecting it to last forever. I think it goes out in 1 year and I end up having to replace this product every year. I have bought a nicer brand version, but it had the same issues and was more pricey."
4,Great solution!,"This little converter is a great solution for playing my ipod in my car. I was worried about the sound quality, but it sounds really good, just about the same as playing my radio. I don't know how long this will last, but at this price, I would be happy to just buy a replacement if it gives out.I wasn't really thinking about the ""dual position"" thing when I bought this. I could honestly not even remember what my tape deck looked like. But I am so glad I bought this one so I could change it to whatever position the cord needed to be at to fit my player.Highly recommend."
1,THIS Product does not work at all?,NO sound does not work at all?must be defective right out of the box!Had a BELKIN for several years and it worked fine this did not work from day one!
2,When worked was great!,Bought for my daughter as she doesn't have an mp3 jack in her older car. Worked fantastically for about 2 weeks and now just keeps ejecting itself. Waste of money.
3,I love the sound quality but.....,I love the product but after a while it kinda goes psycho. It starts rewinding by it self which makes the music stop. Also the wire gets worn off after a while so I have to bend it sometimes to be able to hear the music.
2,Keeps auto reverse,"With my grateful to a super fast delivery by Amazon.com.Somehow it keeps auto reverse every 10 seconds with my car's cassette player (Ford Escort 1999).**I am not sure what went wrong, Coby or car's cassette player??**Give a good sound quality compare to its price.I will love it if it does not give an auto reverse problem to me!"
4,Works Great!,"The only negative to this product is that you can hear the tape turning slightly while in use. The sound quality is not perfect but very, very good. Works great... pop it in and it goes:)"
4,Meh It Works,"I have found that these little devices are expensive if you don't look hard enough. However I cannot deny the superior sound quality they offer compared to a radio transmitter, and I highly recommend them.If you have problems with this device I would suggest checking your tape deck. Most problems with be with that, and not this device however that is also possible. You may have to wedge something in with the adapter to reach maximum sound quality and avoid the tape turning over while in transit. Any period of silence may enact any 'Next' feature if your tape deck has that installed.I hope this works for you."
4,Easy to use,"I bought this last month, started using from first day with out any issues. I will recommend this as a best option of all cassette adapters.Coby CA-747 Dual Position CD/MD/MP3 Cassette Adapter--Deepak."
2,Great. While it works.,"This worked great for about a month and then started to have problems auto-reversing during play. There is something wrong with the friction wheel in the device that fails after a few dozen hours of work. The sound quality when it was working was great. I wanted this to work, since the FM transmitter products I have used have not met my expectations and cost a lot more.I bought two of these items and the other one has lasted a little longer but it is starting to show the same signs. One suggestion is flipping the cassette part over if you can use it that way in your player. This seems to work for a short drive, but you end up flipping the cassette over and over on long drives and the wires usually get in the way when you're not inserting it in what would seem like the primary direction for your player."
3,Does not Work with iPhone,"This sounds fine, but I had to get an adapter jack for it to work with my iPhone."
2,disappointed,I thought Coby was a decent enough brand but when using this adapter the sound only comes out clearly on one side of the speaker. So this purchase was a disappointment. I tried a few different cars and it's all the same result. And I tried a friend's adapter and that one has no problem at all. Oh well.
3,"Ok, but not good quality","I bought this because I needed to replace another broken cassette adapter. The fact that I even need a cassette adapter suggests that I have a really old car (and I do, it's 1997). I really just wanted a cheap replacement so don't expect too much. It serves its purpose (plays the music off my Iphone) but sometimes can get stuck in my tape deck and I have to eject it and put it back. Not sure if that's the tape deck's fault or my old ass car's fault, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a little bit of both."
1,They Sent Me A Philips Not A Coby,"They sent me a Philips not a Coby! Philips has only one direction to put the cassette in not the “Dual Position” change like the Coby offers! The Philips is flimsy and very useless for my needs! Thanks Amazon, you really screwed this one up! It would cost me more to send it back and get the right one instead so I am stuck with this piece of garbage!"
1,Static unusable after 2 months,Now I am looking for a replacement cassette adapter. Horrible product. Cannot stand the static that it now generates. Huge regret in buying this product.
5,Works,Have now used this adapter with Ipods and Itouch for 4 months. Works in my Accord and Highlander. Just a tad noisy from the turning cassette reels (not sure why they even exist in an adapter) but its livable. The previous Philips adapter cord failed (probably from tension and bending fatigue) near the ipod plug after years of use. This one looks like it will take the wear and tear better with a coiled wire.
3,"Works OK, but...","When I first got this product, it worked great. No problems whatsoever in a Camry. Later on, I got a different car, a Taurus, and that's when I started having problems. First off, I had to use the auto-reverse deck fix, no big deal, but then it seemed like it would only play out of the right channel. If it got really warm in the car, then the left side would start to kind of work. After a bit of poking at it, I found that the cord could be an issue on this. The way that the cord comes out, it interferes with the cassette loading all the way into the deck. If I press down really hard on the left edge of the ""tape"" both sides work, but as soon as I let off, it goes back to only one side working. Also, this thing will warp if left in the hot sun."
1,Never worked right,"I put this in my car tape deck and plugged it into my iPhone. At first I thought it wasn't working at all, but then I realized I had to turn the volume *way* up on the car stereo. It played for about 5 minutes (with fairly bad/fuzzy sound quality). Then suddenly all the bass dropped out and I only got a very tinny rendition of the music. I tried popping it out and back in several times as well as messing with the iPhone itself. It would appear that either I got a faulty cassette adapter or it was incompatible with my car stereo."
5,Good Product,"love it. it works really well in my car and can be adapted to other tape players. doesnt have trouble running out of tape or anything like that. nice, easy to put away. good, good!"
1,constant clicking made me throw this away!,"I had to finally toss my old adaptor that had developed a hiss. I always rely on Amazon for reviews and such and ended up ordering this as my replacement. The coiled cord is nice for the car, but aside from that, this thing is garbage! Constant clicking -it sounded like there was a metronome in my car! I couldn't take it! I went to radioshack (I was on a road trip and could not do without music!) and got one for around $20 -no hiss, no click, just great sounding music."
1,Mass Produced for Quick Revenue,"There can't be many people with cassette players left who actually need this device, but alas, I am one of them. My car cassette player is a Bose, factory installed by Volkswagen (1997). So, when I got through the dangerous mega-plastic packaging (actually did it without cutting my finger), I popped it in the player and watched as it flipped between side ""a"" and ""b"" and the ejected itself (all in 4 seconds). In short, when you read the fine print on the package, it says, ""may not work in cassette players that have auto-reverse"". Mind you, the Sony and Memorex adapters I bought and used for years had no issue with my auto-reverse (aren't they all auto reverse??). Anyway, as I continued to read on, disillusioned with my purchase, I saw also that it contains traces of LEAD (???) in the cord. Made in China, folks, where safety and functionality are optional."
2,Worked fine for a little while,"I bought this instead of shelling out $100+ for an adaptor to use the ipod in the car. It was fine for a few months, but then the tape stopped working and kept ejecting from the tape deck. I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it."
3,need a little work....,"It's working all fine now, but as has been mentioned in previous reviews, you need to do a little work in order to make it run properly in a cassette player that has auto rewinding feature...."
1,UTTER CRAP!!!,DID NOT WORK!! I had the same problem that a few others mentioned -- my tape deck kept trying to auto-reverse this adapter... RETURNED! Stick with the Philips...
1,issues with adapter,"The first problem encountered was that when you eject the adapter, and because the wire attaching the plug is located on the side of the adapter and not the back, the adapter would catch in, and jam in the player. I remedied this by taping the wire so that it was tight against the side and re-routed to the back (player open side).Lately I notice the skipping (drop outs of sound) which I can only surmise is the result of a faulty contact with the player's head. I intend to trouble-shoot this problem by re-cleaning the player's heads. If that corrects the problem, then it would not be the adapter, but the player."
2,Poor sound quality,"Others seem to be happy with the quality of theirs so perhaps I just got one that's a dud but it has a LOT of static noise, to the point of being distracting from the music. I would purchase a different brand next time."
2,Noisy Apparatus,"The mechanical apparatus is very noisy in the cassette slot. This noise competes with the sound of the music, making for a very unpleasant listening experience."
5,works great,"Works great in my 1989 am/fm cassette player. Just insert like an ordinary cassette and connect to the zune, music comes out car speakers, pretty good sound quality and good volume. Glad I got it."
4,I like this one!,"I've tried three different tape adapters recently, with this being the fourth. My car's factory stereo is equipped with an automatic tape reverser which could not be disabled. This was the ONLY tape adapter I could get to work in combination with the recommended Macguyvering from another reviewer here. Now the thing plays nonstop with no tape flipping interference and confusion on my car's end.The sound itself is a little fuzzy or staticy. I don't notice it much, to be honest. I am not sure if this is due to my cassette player or the adapter itself. It would be better if I didn't have to take it apart to get it to work properly in my car, but after throwing away three other ones in as many weeks, I'm very very happy with this one."
5,great so far!,great product so far! i've had it for about a month/month an a half and i use it everyday on my 40 minute drive to and from work. quality is soooooo much better than my FM transmitter and i don't have to keep searching for a clear station while i'm driving! I would definitely recommend it! I haven't faced any of the problems other users have stated.
1,Great product! For two days!,"When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.I didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour?Yes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..."
1,Doesn't work,"Like many other people, my car's cassette player keeps ejecting this. It seems that the device won't work on cassette players with auto-reverse."
2,Quickly broke.,"I was going through items I bought with the intent to review more, then I came across this.This item was thrown away months ago.I don't expect tape deck play adapters to last long, or to cost much, and this one did neither. Sure, it was cheap- but with all those positive reviews I figured it to be a good product. Not three months after I purchased it, the thing stopped working, literally broke (physically) and was thrown in the trash. I bought another generic brand one and it's still going strong 8 months after purchase.But, that's just me."
1,Not compatible with auto side reverse tape decks.,"I am very sorry to say this cassette adapter would not work in my auto reverse tape deck. I do not know if it is the wheel tension that is triggering the ""side reversal"" but it only plays for a few seconds before going to ""side 2"", realizing there is no side 2, and spitting the tape out."
1,Still haven't received it,"i still have not received this item yet. i purchased it on may 5th, and still don't have it. now, first thought would be that it just got delayed some how. well, this is not the first time i've ordered something from amazon and didn't receive the item. and you would think that in a situation like this you could just contact the supplier, being amazon, and explain the situation to get it worked out. has anybody tried getting in contact with an amazon representative? you can't, there is no link that says, CONTACT US, like most websites. this review is the only means of communication, if you call it that. the first time i let it slide. i will no longer order from amazon again, i've learned my lesson."
3,works like a charm,"after reading and following the modifications posts, worked like a charm.Thought I would try it pre mod's and b4 it got through a song it reversed, then quit.OK; said I, lets do the mods, and I'm happy to report, works as prescribed."
3,cassette tape sound quality,"I purchased this cassette adapter at the same time I bought a FM transmitter adapter. I now remember how bad cassette tape quality was. The sound is muffled like the cassette tapes always were. My wife heard the tape spinning and she didn't like to hear that, but it didn't bother me as much as the quality of the music coming from the speakers.The FM transmitter had much better sound quality. I was surprised that there was so much difference."
1,Piece of junk,"This tape adapter is a piece of junk. When I first put it in my car's tape adapter, it couldn't read it. After I read the reviews, I decided to modify it myself. When I fixed the gears inside of it and gotten rid of one of them, it finally worked. The problem is now that it's just not sensitive enough to play at a good volume level. It's not loud enough and after 30 seconds, it rejects the tape.DON'T BUY"
2,"Dosent work in my car, even while modded.",Bought this in hopes or replacing my FM transmitter. After reading all the reviews it sounded like it should work moded even with my cars auto reverse feature. That wasnt the case. Even while modded it still just auto flipped every 2 secs. Unusable. I threw it out. Luckily it was cheap. I ended up just buying a whole new car receiver. You can get some great ones cheap. Just buy a new radio and dont waste $10 like I did.
3,iit works sometimes,if you have auto reversing then this works randomly. it just a problem with your radio not this device. my advice is use the type that use the radio transmitter to get your mp3 player into your radio. this isnt that reliable.
5,Very pleased with this purchase,"This cassette adapter has done exactly what it is supposed to. The sound quality is excellent, and it works perfectly! One thing I thought I'd share, in case it happens to someone else: when we first put the adapter in and turned our MP3 player on, the sound was horrendous. Very staticky and we could hardly hear the music. Then I realized that we had the sound turned almost all the way up on the MP3 player... so I turned it almost all the way down and turned the car stereo up instead. Instant fix! So far we're very pleased with it and it was worth every penny! It sounds much better than the FM transmitter we were using before, and it's much easier to use."
1,Worked all of two minutes,Worthless. It worked for two minutes and then stopped. I tried over and over again to get it to work to no avail. I already threw the packaging away so I can't return to Amazon. Avoid this and search for something else!
5,Cheap portable DVD car player solution!,Works great. Sound is very clear. We plugged it into the headphone port on laptop and had a great entertainment system in the car for kids. The cord on the cassette adapter is very short! Barely reached to the back of front passenger seat from our van's tape player.
5,Sweet!,"So, I recieved this item 3 days sooner than expected. Opened up and everything was in excellent condition. I plugged it into my phone to play my mp3s in my car and it works like a champ! No problem with autoreverse or anything! Sweet!"
5,The only reliable one I've found,I've tried several different cassette adapters and this is the only one that's lasted more than a year. In fact my first one did so well that I bought two more: one for my wife's car and one to replace the original. The only problem is that four years later the original is still working fine so I've got the third one still in its original packaging.
5,Works great,The cassette adapter works wonderfully and I really like the dual position allowing for any kind of holder. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
4,Good item for the price,"The Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter is a good, inexpensive way to listen to your MP3 player in your car if you have an older stereo system.The adapter arrived quickly from Amazon and I have not had any problems. Another quality purchase from Amazon."
4,Works good,Had a problem when I first used it. The cassette player would keep reversing. Got that fixed and all is well.
1,Horrible!!! don't buy it!!!! waste of money!!!,"Within 2 weeks stop working now is on the garbage, and I have to buy another one.. It keeps repeating cheap items at the end will cost you more money!!!!!! Now I am buying a sony adapter...."
1,Coby Cassette Adapter,"This product did not work in my car. No matter what I tried to do, as per instrucions from other reviewers, it would not work. Within two seconds after I would insert the cassette adapter, the car's tape deck would eject the adapter. A complete waste of money."
1,Auto-Reverse,"This adapter didn't work in my car because of the auto-reverse feature, and it seems that a lot of people are having trouble with this...In my opinion they should make a separate adapter that doesn't have auto-reverse on it, then people will buy that instead of seeing what they have to do to make it work, and then end up not buying the product."
4,Good product,"i like it alot. sound quality is really good, and the fact that you can put it into multiple types of cassette players is a real benefit.one bad thing is that the cable is way too long. its so long that your mp3 player can fall out of your car, without the cord holding it back. i lost my ipod touch because of this.great product, highly recommended to anyone with a car with not way to connect an mp3 player. much better sound quality than a fm transmitter.ps, there is some white noise in the background, because of the way sound is transferred by the adapter"
1,My car cassette player hated this!,"I am sure this might work well for people whose cassette players don't do auto-reverse, but I can't turn that feature off in mine, so my iPod played for about 30 seconds and then turned off. Drove me nuts!!! It worked when the car wasn't actually moving, so maybe it's just my player, but I returned it and got something better..."
1,coby ca747 one channel only,You get what you pay for sometimes. The Coby CA747 from day one had sound in only the left channel. Putting my finger in the cassette opening and pushing down seemed to get two channels occasionally but then nothing. The auto revers fix described in one of the reviews did not fix the issue but I knew this was not the problem. Just seems the head was not aligned with the cars cassette deck. Going to another vehicle had the same issues. A much pricier unit purchased from a local big box retailer works great. Based upon the reviews and being cheap I thought I'd give this one a chance. A gamble that didn't pay out.
1,Ejected,Returned item as it would be ejected by my vehicle's cassette palyer after two minutes everytime I tried.
3,Worked great but last only 5 weeks,I got this for my wife since she didn't want a bluetooth or FM connector for her phone when driving. She liked it very much until it stopped working after 5 weeks of usage right in the middle of a phone call for no reason.
1,Don't buy it,"Does not work well at all in either of our vehicles, skips and stops altogether, sound is awful."
2,"Warning about the ""warranty""","I purchased this product in April 2009. In January 2010 the product stopped working properly. It now skips sound every 5 seconds or so. I tried calling Coby's warranty service and their CSR verified what I feared. The warranty is exactly as it states on Coby's on website:[...] . In order to get a replacement you have to send the original item back to Coby (which will likely cost you $4 shipping) AND you must send them a $6 money order to cover return shipping back to you. So essentially the warranty is useless as it's going to cost you more to get a replacement then buying a new one from Amazon. The product did work perfectly for 8-9 months so if you are ok with spending $9 every 8-9 months then this product might be ok for you (assuming you get one that lasts as long as mine did), otherwise look elsewhere."
1,Hiss/Pop during playback,"I ordered the Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter brand new from Amazon. Item arrived as promised. However, the sound quality was horrible. I used a Phillips adapter prior to purchasing this one. The Phillips lasted about 2 years. One day the sound began to come out only from one speaker. The sound quality of the Phillips was outstanding. This one, not so much. I'm not sure if I received a defective unit. I returned it back to Amazon. I will purchase another Phillips and hope the jack does not go bad again."
1,Already broken,"After two days of use, one of the audio channels (right, I think) has cut out completely. The wire the comes with this is extremely cheap, and the wires have messed up somehow at the 1/8"" connection side. I can get the full audio after messing with it, but it again goes out if the wire moves at all. Unacceptable."
4,works well,"This cassette adapter is exactly what I need to listen to my iPod in the car. I've owned two others. The first (can't remember the brand) lasted years before the tape in the cassette broke. The second (this exact model) lasted about 8 months and then the wheels stopped turning and it would no longer play. I was disappointed but these things are cheap so I just bought another. I like the dual position for the cord, and the spiral cord that stretches long enough for someone in the back seat to adjust the iPod, but that doesn't take up too much room otherwise. Also, the sound quality of this model is pretty good."
3,"Popping NOises, and really bad sound...but","I fixed the issues, for the time being. I turned down the bass on my stereo. I also made the default volume 75% on my phone. This is the combination that worked for me. I also left the casette in. I figured if there was dust and other stuff in there, then i would have to let it settle. The burn in period was about 3 days. Afterwards it was AMAZING, the sound clarity improved so much. So don't give up, try these things. You may need to clear the dust from inside your tape player, I'm sure that may be the cause of many issues.Fix eject issue:[...]"
3,Auto reverse issues?,"Great suggestions here that helped me find the right solution for my situation, so thx very much.I came here expecting to buy a new adapter to replace the Coby one I have that recently started auto-reversing constantly. (It used to do this occasionally, but over several years got worse and worse.) While researching which replacement to get, I saw this comment and decided to try to fix mine. It seems reasonable that tape decks are looking for a bit of tension and contact at the right points -- but not too much -- to fool them into thinking there's a tape in there.I tried several combos of innards until one worked. Some auto-ejected immediately. Some played, but with a grinding noise that others have described. I finally left in ONLY the biggest gears in the center (that usually keep tension on the tape spools), and removed the entire set near the capstan/mag head. So far, so good!Note -- it helps to take a couple camera phone shots of the innards so you can re-assemble..."
1,Stopped working correctly within a week,"I bought this product on Amazon in February of 2012 for $8.05. I see it is now $5.49 in July 2012.It worked great for a few days but eventually, like tape adapters often do, at least in my experience, the audio would only play out of one side of speakers in my car. This time it would only play out of the left side. I tried adjusting it, checked levels and fade, reinserted, ejected, reinserted, tried in other tape decks. It was definitely the product. I was going to send it back and get a refund but decided it was not worth the time or money.I hope that if you receive one, it is one that works correctly for a longer period of time.The end."
2,initially worked but then........,"Overall, this product worked ok with my ipod. However, when I played some songs, the quality of the songs didn't transfer well into my car speakers. They would sound very shrill, especially if there were words containing the letter ""s"". Also, sometimes the songs would lack in bass whereas when I'd listen to my ipod with regular apple headphones, there was a good amount of bass in the songs. About 6 months after using the cassette, the wire started breaking (and I never removed the cassette from my car nor did I handle it roughly). Music started coming out only from one of my speakers. After trying to fix it with electrical tape, sound wasn't being transferred at all to my car speakers. -.-'"
2,You get what you pay for,"When I bought this I was in desperate need of a new cassette adapter for my car and wasn't looking to break the budget, so I bought this guy. At first it worked okay, but within a few weeks it started skipping and making music painful to listen to. Furthermore on more than one occasion it got jammed for one reason or another, and I eventually just pulled the wire out of it (yes, I know, not intended). Perhaps I got a faulty one, but in the end I was not very pleased. Buyer beware~~~!"
1,Nice features but...,"This cassette adapter has nice features but the only problem is it doesn't work. I got this adapter and it worked just fine for... one day. No, this wasn't due to auto reverse function of my car because I got that fixed. I recommend going with dynex it seems like there the best brand out there when it comes to cassette adapters."
4,Great product! use it daily (after modifying it),"The product is great, However when first used out of the box it is loud. Best way to go around this is to remove some uncessary plastic parts to subdue the rattling noise. Once that is done you can hardly hear it when the tape drive is on."
3,Constant Humming Noise,I bought this cassette adapter for my Zune and as long as the song has a high level of bass and treble this works perfectly. But if it doesn't then while the song is playing you hear a constant humming noise that increases as you accelerate. At first I thought it was my car so I tried it in 2 other cars and they all had the same problem. If this problem was eliminated the product would be perfect.
3,"Good, sort of",I got this product because I have an older car with no cd player. I have an I-pod Nano and wanted to use it in the car. For the price the adapter has a great sound however my cassette player kept ejecting it. Sometimes I could go days with out it ejecting and then it would just spit it out. I finaly gave up and installed a hard wired fm modulator. I'm not sure if other people with different cars would have the same problem
2,Works well until it wears out,I bought this in August and it had completely destroyed itself by February. The internal gears wore out. I used it about 80 minutes a day 5 days a week during my commute.
2,Would be great if it worked,"Simply put, this is a great concept of a product that failed within the first 20 minutes of working. I inserted it into the cassette player on my stock 2005 Honda CR-V radio and driving bliss resumed - listening to my ipod. Then my radio began to FF the casette, thus interrupting the playback. I ejected it, and tried two more times. Each time, 20 minutes in or so, it would FF.I sent it back.Your mileage may vary."
3,"broke , no clue whats the reason , may be from the heat","i gave 3 stars, i had it less than 5 monthes and last week , didnt work , no reason may be from the sun heat"
1,trash dont buy,very poorly made used it a few days and the black rubber on the left side fell off i opened it and fixed it only to have it fall off a few days later opened it again and fixed it but now its not working anymore also the gears inside were making WAY too much noise. over all JUST DON'T BUY IT!!! you can find something a lot cheaper that does a better job then this useless thing.
1,Waste Of Money,"It comes in Mono (You can only hear it on one side of the speaker) and you can barely hear it at full blast. The hissing and the sound the cassette player makes was louder. A real waste of money. You get what you paid for it... I will never again base my purchases on price. Read the reviews, people."
1,Stop working every few seconds!,"Before I bought this tape, I had an old tape. The old tape is very cheap, just more than $2.00. It worked noise so I decided to buy a new one which more expensive. I think it will better than my cheap one. But, everything is disappointed. I inserted it into the cassette of my car and the noise is louder, but that is not the worst thing. The tape runs every 30 seconds and stop about 3 seconds. How can I enjoy the music with such a bad tape. Now, I comeback to use my old tape and feel sad myself. I lost nearly $8.00. ZZZzzz..."
3,After fixing the auto reverse problem it works fine.,I had the problem where the tape would get ejected after being inserted. This wouldn't happen all the time but enough to be annoying. So I finally got around to taking it apart like one of the other reviewers said to do. I didn't exactly follow their instructions because they were unclear to me.Instead when I took the adapter apart I ended up just taking out the entire guide part in the lower right hand corner. Just pull up on it to get it out. Also take the gear out that is under it. That is all I did and then put it back together and it worked fine.It works fine now but it gets three stars because I had this trouble with it.
1,VERY Disappointing!,"I was very encouraged when I read so many glowing reports, especially regarding older vehicles. However, this product DOES NOT work well in my vehicle, a 1999 Jeep Cherokee with the factory-installed stereo system still intact. I'm not sure why, but I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the fact that my tape player does not have an actual play button - it begins playing the tape as soon as it is inserted. I tried switching between radio/cd/tape and then engaging the adapter and iPod, but that did not help. When engaged, the volume is so low that you cannot hear it while driving. I could go on - but .... You really do get what you pay for. And I was so looking forward to listening to my iPod while driving."
2,Very noisy,"This is an unusual product in that it comes with a coiled connection cord (about 5' long when fully stretched out), which makes for a neater setup in the car. And because the connector to the cassette is modular it will work with a wide variety of decks. Sound quality is good, though I didn't do any kind of rigorous test.The problem for me was noise. I purchased it to replace another adapter that was intermittently noisy. This one makes a permanent, very noticeable, non-stop clatter whenever the deck is turning. This makes it totally unusable for me and I'm going to have to return it. That's unfortunate, given the price, but there you are."
1,Great Price - Great Product - NOT A GREAT PRODUCT,"UPDATE:After my initial excitement, I found that I didn't use this much. Yesterday, I went to plug in my iPod and it didn't work. The cassette ejected itself as others have note. Sometimes one channel worked. Tried it with my Blackberry - nothing. Even though I have had this for almost three years I've used it less than 10 times.NOT RECOMMENDED REGARDLESS OF HOW CHEAP IT SEEMS.DISREGARD THE BELOW:About three minutes after this arrived, I was driving down the block with my Blackberry happily playing tunes through my car stereo. Couldn't have been easier and I can't see how it could be cheaper."
5,Awesome,This is a great item to hook your mp3 player to you cassette deck. No issues and it sounds great!
3,Works okay,"Does the job, but makes a bit of baseline noise and can easily be overdriven. Other tape adapters I've owned can accept a line-level input, or full volume from an iPhone without distortion, but this one can be completely overdriven and sound like garbage - but it sounds fine if you turn down the source volume.The 90 degree plugin is too bulky to work with an iPhone 4 wearing a Bumper.The coiled cord is kind of nice, depending on how you use it, but for how I use it dangling in front of my car stereo, it's actually more bulky than a regular tightly-wound cord would be. I wish they would have shown the cord in the product shot.Otherwise I'm relatively satisfied."
2,Sometimes does the job,"I'm not sure if it is my tape deck or the product but it doesn't work very well. if I hit a bump the ""tape"" resets and the tape deck ejects it. It would be awesome if that didn't happen but it was so frustrating I just stopped using it."
2,Not Always Functional,The tape does not work all the time. It tries to reverse to side b randomly and frequently. I haven't figured out how to fix it...
2,Didn't work for me...,"When I finaly popped this thing in, it works but it is getting worse an worse by the day and I've only had it for about 2 weeks. It may just be my tape player in my car but this thing just makes my car tape player click allot and it spits the tape adapter out ever so often and its VERY irritating. I'll keep it until I go buy one from a store..."
2,Just ok,"I couldn't find any of these cassette adapters in the stores, maybe they're not making them as much anymore? this one definitely causes a slight distortion if my music is turned up even a little bit and has an odd humming sound when the Ipod isn't plugged in. On the plus side, it's nice that the cord is coiled, keeps it out of the way more than the others. Still not sure if I'm going to return this, not really happy with the quality. Disappointing."
3,"3 Stars out of box, 5 Stars after moding","This is a simple plug and play cassette for your iPod/MP3 player. Out of the box the internal components of the cassette make a little bit a noise when in use in the cassette slot in the car. I found that in my car the cassette player would auto try to rewind, but since the cassette has a stopper from letting it be rewound my car would pop it out of the slot. I would push it back in and it would work for another 3 or 4 hours until the same thing would happen again. I read online that this is not a isolated problem and it was easily fixed. With the removal of 5 or 7 screws the cassette splits in half and it is very easy to remove the ""stopper"" and gear components that attach to it. After I did this I have not had any problems with it at all and that was about 5 months ago. I am so glad I did this quick 4 minute modification."
4,Does it's job!,"If you want a simple and cheap cassette player to play music from your MP3, this is it! I've had it for several months now and it has yet to fail me.PROS:- Cheap- Works (as in, it plays music without static or whatever)- long chord- chord is spiraled (so it doesn't get too tangled!)CONS:- Sometimes you can hear the cassette spinning (might be normal to my cassette player though)"
1,Bad sound quality and contains lead???,"I got these to play my MP3 player in my car but the sound quality is bad and the label says ""Contains lead. Wash hands after use."" I would've returned it but it only cost $8 so I just threw it away.I would not buy."
2,Piece of junk,"This worked perfectly for twelve hours and now it's stuck the cassette stereo drive in my 1992 Honda Accord. I listened to some music on my portable CD player for half an hour then came home and went to bed. It worked fine this morning for ten minutes, but now it's stuck in the car's cassette drive. Thanks a lot. Now I have to get a pro to remove this. Not recommended."
1,Disappointed,"I tried it as soon as it came and promptly returned it. I barely worked, very low volume."
1,Does Not Work for All Cars.,"This worked fine in my Monte Carlo SS cassette deck, had great sound and really liked the coiled cord. Then, after about two months it stopped working. It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time. I tried the fixes mentioned here, no luck, the unit kept ejecting. I bought another of same and less than one month later, same problem. It either is junk or may be my Monte Carlo auto reverse deck as this Coby works so far without ejecting problems in my imported car. I switched to the Sony Cassette Adapter for the Monte Carlo and so far, all is well."
1,Channel Cuts Out,"worked pretty well. unfortunately, even with infrequent use, after less than a year one channel cuts out and i've got to mess with it very delicately to get it to work. very frustrating and now, basically worthless."
2,ejects all he time,The Cassette adapter ejects all the time from my car stereo. I tried in other stereos as well. Did not bother to send it back because of the postage expense.
2,"Didn't work very well. Also, tape players are beat","I purchased this adapter thinking I could hook up my iPod to my car's cassette player.It didn't work very well, and would only transmit sound to the passenger side speakers. I have since traded in my car with the tape player.If you still have a tape player in your car, don't buy this. Instead, drive said car off a cliff."
1,Ordered a Cassette Adapter...Got Trash,"I went shopping for a new cassette adapter to listen to my iPod in the truck. I got this thing and it would not work at all. Upopn examination I could see the little black drive belt was off the pulley. I used the mod directions in one of the above reviews to see if I could dismantle it for a more in depth examination, but never got it completely opened up, before all the innards just started falling out. I had little white plastic gears and wheels and rubber bands and silver springs all over the place. This is a piece of crap."
1,Royal Buzz Buster,Don't waste your money. Spend the extra ten bucks and get something that will last.
3,Does the job,Not the best sound but turn down the volume and it is better. I use it for podcasts and audiobooks so it is fine for me but I would want better clarity for music.
5,Worth the money,I know there are cheaper tape adapters out there but this one is really good. Have been using it for a year with no problems at all.
4,"Occasionally doesn't work, but good overall","It sounds good, and the adjustable orientation for the wire is great.Occasionally it won't work right away. I have to take it out and spin the gears with my finger, and then it starts working again. I'm thinking it's probably the result of always leaving it in my car in the Texas summer."
1,Decent,"It worked great for the one week i had it. However, after the one week of working perfectly: various rubber bands in the adapter came loose, causing the adapter to stop working."
1,"If it worked, it would be amazing","I read the other posts and saw that many people were having issues with the adapter switching sides. I also saw that there were fixes so I thought I would give it a try.It worked for a the first couple of days without me altering anything (It sounded great too). And then it stopped working and would try to switch sides a few tmes before it would spit the tape out. I attempted to fix it by removing different parts like others suggested here. I consider myself above average with fixing electronics...can repair/build computers, but nothing was working for me. I tried for about 4 days with different configurations of gears and parts...nothing helped. I would turn on my ipod and insert the tape, hear the music, and then it would switch sides back and forth...then spit out the tape.So I threw it out the window after banging it repeatedly on my dashboard. That part was fun!"
2,Not what I'd hoped,"Sure the product was easy to set up and use; the adjustable plug was cool. But, when I put it in my car and pressed play, it would go silent and try to rewind every 10 or so seconds. I have a ford escort 2000 and it just wasn't working. I'd have been ok with that though, except that it wouldn't even pause the music when it tried to rewind. So I'd end up with silence every 10 seconds and then end up on a different part of the song- totally ruining the effect of the music. sound quality was decent when actually playing. but i wasn't satisfied with the prduct. it was a waste of money, unfortunately."
2,Good for less than a month,"This product was good for about 3 weeks, I read it was a fragile product so I was always very careful, but it stopped working anyway."
1,"Poor sound, poor fidelity.","Bought this because my Lexus doesn't have any means of allowing me to play my songs on my MP3 player.I was really excited when I got it because I was leaving on a very long car trip and thought I could enjoy my music on the trip. Boy was I disappointed.The quality of the sound that came through was very poor. I had to crank the volume to 4X normal levels to be able hear it at a reasonable level. There was a lot of background hiss and the bass/treble levels were completely out of whack. The fidelity was very poor: rather than sounding anything like a CD, the quality of the sound more like that of a clock radio."
1,What do you expect in todays technology,After use it broke. Worked well for about three weeks but what do you expect in todays advanced technological world
1,Junk,Easy to place in stereo. Just wish it worked as well as advertised. I would not recommend buying this product.
1,Did not work at the first try,"I've been looking for a cassette to use in my car to play my iPhone music. This one was bad right out of the box. All I got was loud static., no matter what I moved or changed it did not work. Thank goodness Amazon is a reputable company and takes returns of faulty products."
4,Still working great,"I've had this product for years and it is still working great. There are rare breaks in the sound, for maybe 1 second. Other than that, it's great. Also, I use it every day, so it's been used a lot."
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"This thing is a piece of junk. It worked perfectly fine for about three months then all of a sudden it produced a loud screeching noise and it is now worthless. I had a tapedeck adapter that was back from the 90's. It worked for like 15 years before it gave out and I bought this one. This one only lasted 3 months. You can tell just by looking at it, it's a poorly constructed adapter. It's worth it to spring for a pricier one, because your going to end up doing that in four months anyway when this craps out."
4,Good Sound quality but cracking noice,"This cassette adapter is good for it's price.Sound quality is good and fits to almost all kind of players.There is a noticable cracking noice from player, if you listen in low volume then its not a good option for you."
1,broken,"I loved this product for as long as it worked, which was a total of 15 hours or 1 book. Now it rattles and skips and stops."
1,"Not a very good strategy, more like a scare tactic.","Avoid this one at all costs! Historically speaking, for growth, stocks are pretty much always a better investment. As an investor, you must weather the downturn in stocks, not fear them and run for the bonds."
1,10% of this book is education about Bonds; 90% stock basics,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about investment products OTHER than common stocks. Instead, (in the book on tape), I got 5-10 minutes about the different types of bonds, a little detail about T-bills, and the frank admission that this book ""doesn't really discuss corporate bonds"". WHAT!? The whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 - for that, I must say he was prescient (Too bad I didn't read this in 1999!). More time is spent describing the basics of common stocks, and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds! Oh - and that WRONG formula for computing the price/sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version. I actually had to rewind the tape to see if I had heard correctly!"
2,Not enough content; poor research.,"I gave the author 2 stars because I agree with him on one basic premise - equities are generally overvalued. However, I found the rest of the book to be entirely lacking.First, it severely lacks content. The book is short to begin with - and what few pages it has are spent poorly. Almost 1/3 of the book is dedicated to descriptions of the 30 DOW companies.His investment strategy is simple. In fact, it's too simple. His conclusions are based upon very little research - nothing more than historic data that just happens to work out.He has some valid points (i.e. zero coupon bonds as investments), but spent very little effort crafting it. The knowledge encapsulated within the 200+ pages of this book could be condensed to a single web page with little effort."
3,I got what I paid for,"I really can't defend this book, other than to say, ""It told me what I wanted to know."" Higgins' original Beating The Dow was my first introduction to the wonderful world of investment literature some ten years ago, so my purchase of this latest one was not an impartial decision. What's ironic about the existence of BTD With Bonds is that at the end of the original book, Higgins plainly showed that mixing his original Beating The Dow theory with other investments only weakened it. So why did I buy this book? I wanted a very clear, easy to understand book about investing in bonds. And that is what I got. While I probably won't be following the investment advice in this book, I did find it a pleasant alternative to Bonds for Dummies, or some similar title."
2,superficial,"Although O'Higgins' point about stocks being over-valued is well taken, he does not go nearly far enough to prove his thesis. His new method is not back-tested before the late '70s, and he provides none of the source data that would enable an interested party to verify his returns or extend the method."
1,Not the Book I Hoped It Would Be,"I was disappointed with this book. I read every page from beginning to end. The reasons for his strategy are interesting but as other reviewers point out here at Amazon, the actual part where he shows you how to use his method is really bad. It has mistakes. It talks about the S&P Industrial Index when it means the SP500 Index. I get the feeling that Michael farmed the last part of the book out to the coauthor. Whatever I suggest just reading the end of the book at the bookstore."
2,Poorly written,"The central tenet of this book can be summarized in one sentence: ""Buy bonds because stocks are due for a meltdown."" Problem with this book is that it's repeated so often. Finally in the next-to-last chapter, the investment strategy is introduced, but the fundamental reasoning for why it works is not explained (why gold?). There's even a major editorial error. It says to subtract the S&P500 yield from the bond yield and to invest in stocks if the result is ""greater than the S&P500 yield."" In fact it should say ""invest in stocks if the result is less than zero""--i.e. the S&P500 yield is greater than the bond yield."
2,"Not very good, but....","The book was not very well written, and why he felt the need to devote 70 pages describing in copious detail all 30 of the Dow stocks is beyond me. However, his 30 year zero-coupon analysis does have something going for it, and the inflation rate is a good predictor for a change in asset allocation."
2,Hire an editor,"I'm disappointed in the quality of this book. O'higgins is probably on to something, but the explanation he offers on how to use his method is just about incomprehensible. Did no one bother to read this book before shoving it out the door? I really tried to like this book, but it just has so many errors, you're better off checking it out of the library."
1,"Method is GOOD, but the book is VERY POOR!!!","The method of BTDWB is good, but the book is VERY POOR!!! There is serious mistake in the method described. Don¡t forget to go to Corrections to ""17 Simple Steps to Super Returns"" for a further reading. (You can find it in Amazon website----Editorial Reviews) But the correction is still containing mistake. Please note the Gold Price of the example in Corrections to ""17 Simple Steps to Super Returns""!!"
1,"It doesn't work, even in the past","The biggest problem I see with this book (besides the entire premise of timing the ""overvalued"" market) is that it doesn't even work with the historic data he choose to show in his book! I've seen lots of books that are entirely backtested and don't work in the future, but this is a new one. The stock market has been overvalued since 1980? He's stuck in T-Bills with his +5% in years where the BTD5 are doing +30%.It's too bad he feld the need to put his name on this total piece of trash, and start it with the words ""Beating the Dow..."". The original BTD (and the assortment of improved variants of it that now exist) was, and still is, worthwhile.I'm glad I skimmed it in the store instead of buying it."
2,Interesting...but confusing,I agree with much of what has already been said as far as the amount of filler and the editorial glitches. And can anyone figure out the last chart -- table 11.1? These numbers make no sense and don't even correspond with the info on table 9.1. I began the book with some excitement but ended up feeling very uncertain about the method.
2,Poor editing makes me wish for my money back,"Here is the book in a nutshell: Stocks are overpriced, so buy bondsPage 166 has an asset allocation worksheet for your pleasure, but good luck using it...the text instructions have at least one error and Step 8 is very unclear.I'm much happier with ""Stocks for the Long Term"" by Jeremy Siegel, also available here at Amazon"
5,king of the hill,product arrived sooner than expected and in good shape. I love this tv program. I will buy the next sets as they become available.
5,King of the DVD,I'm verey happy with this poduct. As I have been with all I have purchased at amazon. Thank you for the quick delivery most of all.
5,King Of The Hill Complete Series,"When I want to get away from the World's problems, I insert one of the DVD'S into my DVD player and instantly become entertained. I just love this show and everything about the show. I just wish that they would bring it back to Fox, and make more episodes."
5,"YOU FAILED ENGLISH, YOU SPEAK ENGLISH","Mike Judge is a genius. Beavis and Butthead were the best, BEST cartoon of the 90's. King of the Hill ended the decade and began the new one with its over the top comedy that somehow was realistic. This show will live in cartoon history as one of the greats up there with South Park and The Simpsons."
1,"Stop! You only get 12 razors, not 144","I ordered this bulk purchase of razors (144 razors) and then received only a single package of 12 razors. I asked Amazon to investigate, but buyer beware. You will not get what is advertised for this item, and Amazon will blame you rather than the buyer. Somehow they let this scam stay up on their website."
2,Horrible shaving experience,"My skin seems to be very sensitive, I have problems with irritation, razor burn, ingrown hairs, razor bumps. So I have been experimenting with as many shavers as I can. This one constantly gave me cuts and nicks, it has no glide pad with aloe or vitamin E or anything, it has a horrible angle also. If you don't mind a bloody mess, this shaver is for you. I would recommend the Schick double-blade over this one."
1,Satan's Razors,"I was trying to save some money by buying disposable razors. Since these were cheap and for sensitive skin, I went ahead and bought them. They are awful. I really don't get how they are supposed to be for sensitive skin. I hardly ever cut myself shaving. No matter how much shave gel I used or how much or how little pressure I applied to the razor, I managed to cut myself every time. Also, I noticed that the shave wasn't as close, so I still felt stubble after shaving. I just don't think the money saved is worth the cuts and discomfort. I gave these to my dad and I will be buying my normal, multi-blade razors."
5,every bit as good as the expensive ones,"I used to use a variety of those expensive ones with extra blades and built-in shaving cream etc because I get terrible rashes from shaving my legs. Then a health magazine and a newspaper both ran stories which said that fewer blades are less likely to cause irritation, and that you might as well use a simple disposable. So I bought a huge box of these which I am still slowly working my way through. The shaving rashes are certainly not worse, and in fact I think they are a little better. I see no advantage to the fancy kinds."
5,Super,"I have been shaving for awhile now. Always have been a blade man. Unlike my roomie. he uses an electric razor. IMHO he's a wuss.I have tried many other blades. Some have 2,3,4 blades, have nicer handles too. I have even bought a blade at Walmart that resembles this, it was the worst of all. Hence my attempt to find this razor finally took me to Amazon. It has been refreshing to use this razor. Cuts the hair off my face, comfortable to use, and not as expensive as the others I've tried that don't work as well."
2,"Does not cut close, takes multiple passes...","I bought these at a store after reading the multiple good reviews on Amazon. I usually use disposable double blade razors. I have found that these do not perform as well as the double blade razors I usually use. The main problem is that these do not seem to cut as close to the skin. It still looks like I have a day of growth after shaving. It also takes a lot more passes with the razor to remove the hair, which actually irritates my skin more than a two blade razor. Lastly, the blade does not last as many shaves as my normal disposable razor. I have an average amount of facial hair and the blade lasts 2-3 shaves before it feels like it is just scraping my skin. This razor might work for you as it did with some of the other reviewers, but in my experience, I'd go with another product."
1,coby radio,"I purchased this to use at the gym, specifically to watch the television while on a treadmill. The dial is not digital and I find it very hard to tune in to the stations. I had another Coby with a digital tuner that was much more effective."
5,The Series' Cliffhanger...,"This was one of the three episodes I had originally taped back 10 yrs. ago, but the tape has poor quality now. I have to agree that I remembered the series enough to buy the entire collection. I've never seen the original daytime version of Dark Shadows (1966-71) but I like everything about this revival series much better. The stupid folks at NBC decided to cancel the series after this episode because of poor ratings (poor because it premiered the same time the GULF WAR started...if that war never happened, the show would have continued) Nevertheless, a wonderful collection and if they were to remake Dark Shadows again, I would definitely keep my eyes open."
5,I would actually rate this a 5+ stars!,"I never got into the old Dark Shadows, but i thought this was fantastic! I saw the mini-series on tv back in 1991 and i wish i would have taped it. I'm wondering and questioning if they will ever show it on tv again? Until then, I'm buying the episodes one by one. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Dark Shadows. Joanna Going is wonderful in this and Ben Cross does a fantastic job of Barnabus Collins - not to mention that he's good-looking!"
5,Hilarious!!,I'm still in stitches from watching it for the third time. No political or religious organization is safe from his wild satire! Robin is truly a gifted comedian. One of the funniest men alive!!
5,Robin Williams At His Best,"Its been too long since one of comedy's geniuses has done a standup routine, but now the wait is over. Robin Williams explodes onto the stage, telling jokes at lightspeed, getting laughs everytime. Packed full of both extremely creative and outrageous humor, Williams once again proves that he is the king of stand up. He train of thought never seems to break, as he jumps in and out of dozens of characters. Despite the fact his jokes include lots of physical movement, this routine is not recommended for children, due to the adult humor and language. A 5 star congratulations to Mr. Williams and this outstanding routine!"
3,Not Bad,"I like Robin Williams' comedy as much as the next person. This tape has its moments and as usual it also has the bad language and crude sexual humour that Robin does so well. I didn't find this performance to be drop dead hilarious though. A lot of what he does on this tape is very similar to what he has done on shows like Jay Leno and Conan O' Brian (but a lot of comedians are repetitive anyway). This tape does have some really funny stuff without question, but I didn't find it to be the kind of comedy that would make me lose my breath."
5,So hilarious!,"I loved this. Every one at my work recommended it to me, so I rented it. I WAS NOT LET DOWN! Now I am the one recommending it to everyone else. I couldn't find it anywhere else to buy, and now I find it for a good price. You should atleast rent this movie!"
1,I USED to be a Robin Williams fan.,"Of course I had never seen him ""Live""Crude,Filthy, Mrs. Doubtfire would not approve!!!!!"
1,This video is awful,"While, I have enjoyed the movies Robin Williams has been in, the video has given me a different perspective on him. He may be funny, but the language and topics in this video are awfull. I was embarrassed to listen to it. I won't waste my money on another one of his videos."
1,A complete and total disappointment,"I'm not personally attacking anyone who liked this DVD or anything, it's just I got no joy out of it. Now i love stand up comedy, Jerry Seinfield: Live on Broadway, and The Blue Collar Comedy Tour has left me rolling in the aisles. Robin Williams however does not work for me, I love his movies, almost every single one of them: comedy and drama. I do not like his stand up because he moves at such a frantic pace that he doesnt really have a stand up routine it's like a kindergartener who gets up on stage and only tells the punchline of the jokes but does it at such a rapid pace that you cant help but smile...notice i said smile and not laugh. Truth be told i did not laugh much while watching this.bkm"
1,Yow!,"Robin Williams is a third rate Steve Martin, and this dvd is something that should be shoved back into the horse's end that dropped it.William's sophomoric monologue is tired at best. This dvd will probably be popular with citizens of other countires outside of the United States.It definitely won't make it in West Virginia."
4,Flash,NO time for talking or commenting with friends or family watching this DVD.....Robin moves so fast its hard to keep up with one joke before he is in to another on a different direction. But it is an enjoyable show to watch for the Robin Williams Fans.....you wont be dissappointed.
2,Should try harder,"Robin Williams is, without doubt, an incredible comic genius. But as with many comedians of his ilk, there is a lot of muted rage beneath the humour (check out John Cleese in his pre-Fish Called Wanda days, for example -- especially the Fawlty Towers series). And this rage of his is what comes across strongest in Live on Broadway, and it simply gets in the way. Then, too much of Williams' material here is a rehash of stuff he has done before, or stuff other stand-ups have done (and done much better). To see him on top form, check out his earlier stand-up videos from the '80s and '90s. It's not that this is a terrible performance, but having seen him do so much better, it is a disappointment."
5,Laugh yourself Stupid,"This is one of the best comedy rountines I have seen in a long time. He never misses a beat. The one I found the funniest was the joke, ""Quebec is going to break with Canda, but still take the currentsy. It's like a kid moving out, but I would still like allowance, f*ck off you. And their (Candian) money called Loony. I mean how can you take a ecomic situtaion seriously. Oh, the loony is down, how sad for you."" Anyone would love this. You could laugh yourself silly."
5,Hilarious,WARNING: pause the show before you eat or drink anything or you're likely to choke from laughing! Robin Williams hasn't lost any of his stand up comedy chops. This performance goes at his standard frenzied pace and is absolutely hilarious. This is not for the easily offended as he is not politically correct.
3,robin williams on broadway,I always like Robin Williams stuff....even when his shirt is literally dripping sweat like on here!
5,Hilarious,Robin Williams is just hilarious all in his own. But this dvd tops it for me. I was suprized how dirty he could actually get. HAHAHA. This DVD is highly recomended!!!!
5,Side splittingly funny,Robin Williams at his best. I have watched this many times since I have purchased it and it never gets old.
3,Quite a bit of skipping =/,I bought this before Christmas and was really excited because I love his standup. I would have been more excited had I been able to watch all of it before it started skipping so badly that I just turned it off. When I tried again. . . there was no sound from where it skipped and onwards. I guess you get what you pay for. =/
3,Comedy,This movie was okay. Not to impressed with the comedy displayed in the film. Hoping that there will be better ones.
5,Hysterical!,"Typical Robin Williams. Some portions drag a little but when he settles in and gets wound up he is on FIRE. This is real ""tears in the eyes"" laughter, except for the very ending when I litterally couldn't breathe and was begging the TV or Robin to STOP. I couldn't see for the tears and swollen lids. Ladies.... don't miss this part!"
2,Not one of his better stand-up comedy - - -,"I love Robin Williams, & love his stand-up comedy. This one though, was not funny at all. Bored to tears, continuing to watch, to the end of it, hoping it would get better... no... it didn't. Needless to say, this is not one that I'll watch again. I'm just glad I bought it used, & it didn't cost that much."
5,A Definite for any Robin Williams Fan,"IF you like Robin Williams you will love him after this energetic performance with kind hearted material from September 11, 2001 (its ok to laugh now)to the truth about Golf. It is a must own."
3,THE EGG,"Go to the bonus features, and go down to the bottem of the page, and press right->, you should have highlighted an icon thats one of those ""parental advisery"" logo things. Then push ok on your remote and you will have the hidden montage of every swear word Robin said during the show!"
5,Robbie rules!,"Great show from the greatest comedian! I laughed the entire show through - only one thing could have brrn better: to be there on Broadway.Pricing? Cheap, even with the shipping to me in Sweden.Shipping? Fast, to be from US to Sweden."
2,very average,compared to His Older stuff this is very run of the mill to me.He went through alot of topics without really saying anything worthwhile remembering to me.I say pass this one by.
1,disapointed,"My wife and I watched this and were extremely disappointed. Not his best! There were some good parts but over all boring. I know it's hard to believe, we are talking about Robin Williams. Wait for a re-run on HBO and don't waste your money."
2,Way too Raunchy,"Robin Williams is a genius when it comes to comedy. His humor is usually so rich and amusing. This DVD turned out to be an exception. The skit about golf was beyond hilarious and a few other bits were funny too but the vast majority of the time even I was turned off by his vulgar humor. I didn't think I could be turned off by this kind of humor. I've heard other comedians do it before and it's funny. Robin Williams with his quick wit took it was over the edge. He'd hit something vulgar and just keep on going with it until he took it way too far. Also, I don't necessarily mind hearing the F word 50 million times (I didn't count but it must have been close) but the jokes were just too raunchy! He just went over the top. I've never seen R. Williams do anything this tasteless before and hopefully we never will again. I'll forgive him for this one. Hopefully the next DVD of his will better-reflect his typical humor. Keep kids far away from this."
4,An Essential and Timely Reader,"The book is a great guide fort small and medium-sized business owners .

3,"Not his best, BUT-------","Better than nothing, which is all we have had for the last few years. I know the guy writes slow, but I do wish he would get on the stick. I love all of his books, and even though I wasn't quite as enamored of this one, I still want Amanda to continue and to have learned from her mistake and get into more action and thoughtful ideas that make her even better. I agree that I also want some of my favorite characters to reemerge, but not necessarily Arkady. I enjoy Amanda and want her to continue developing. If not Amanda, someone else can be introduced, but get with it. I just like Cobb's books. I reread WEST ON 66 often and enjoy it, too."
4,Romance with the wrong pirate,"In Target Lock, Amanda gets involved romantically with a modern day pirate, whom she helps capture (eventually). The suspense comes from not being sure which way she'll jump when the decision has to be made. This book is an interesting continuation of her story, but I'm still wondering WHEN she's going to notice that the Admiral is interested in her (I see echoes of Honor Harrington here)."
2,Disappointing,"I am a tremendous fan of Cobb's earlier books in this series and was very excited at the prospect of another outing for these characters. However, I found this book to be an enormous disappointment. The relationship Amanda developed with her nemesis seemed dramatically out of character and frankly detracted from the story. I also like an earlier reviewer missed the Arkady character and the strong interaction of Garrett with her crew from earlier outings. I am not sure what direction Cobb is hoping to take the franchise in but this particular outing came across as flat."
2,What a shame...,...that Cobb had to write this [book] and ruin a great character.Amanda Garrett may as well retire now. This book could only have been written by someone that has never worn his country's uniform.Don't buy this book. Don't borrow it from a friend or from the library.
4,A Compelling Story,"Gypsy Summer is a great read--fast-paced and true-to-life. It will certainly open the eyes of young readers and give them a glimpse of what it's like to be homeless: the uncertainty of tomorrow, the despair, and the loneliness of being different. Best of all, it shows how God can take any situation and turn it around for His good. Highly recommended."
4,Good book!,"I just love books - any kind of books that I can get my hands on, I love 'em. This one is a good read, it's kind of sad in parts but I really enjoyed it a lot. Makes you think about real people out there who may be going through the same situations and you want to help them any way you can. I enjoyed this book."
4,Cucumber cactus,So easy to care for...GREAT PLANT FOR THOSE LIKE ME WHO DON'T HAVE A GREEN THUMB ...& IT'S SPROUTING ALREADY. !
4,Finally.,"I am glad to have found this product at [...]. At this moment , on our planet , you would imagine biodegradable laundry detergent would be in every market. Not so in my little neck o'the woods. I appreciate that there is no scent and that this product is concentrated. Also, my post office required pick-up instead of delivery to my address, saying the carton was too heavy.I will re-order.Happy laundering, Jamie in Baywood,Ca."
1,Yuck!,"Yuck! I love Philosophy, but this smells terrible. It smells like really strong soap. I don't get any hit of cookie in this. I was so disappointed when I opened the bottle. I thought that I got a defective bottle until I read other reviews. It smells bad enough that I will through it away. What a waste! If you want a Philosophy product try any other scent, but not this one."
5,So yummy I could almost eat it!,"This was my first philosophy shower gel, and I love it! It is wonderfully rich, and smells like lemon-scented sugar cookies. I lather up with it every day just for the scent. I prefer this shower gel over most of the ""holiday"" fragrances because it's not too sweet, or spicy."
1,Wish I could rate it lower...,"I am a HUGE fan of Philosophy, I buy everything I can. But this item I am very disappointed about. It has a very odd smell, nothing sugar cookie about it! It is the same great product, but the smell is not attractive. I hate to review this so low, because I am such a big fan of Philosophy products. But I wouldn't waste my money on this one. Sorry."
3,good racquet for kid bad supplier-TARGET,Its a decent starter racquet for kids but do not be fooled by Target's ad... it cost 4 times my shipping...
1,Warning - Animal torture,"I like Ed Gorman. I hae read his 1950's detectie series, but this book is sick. I had to stop reading in parts where children and puppies are cut up and tortured. I cannot believe Dean Koontz, the man who never tortured animals in his novels and who wrote such great books about his dog Trixie, wrote a blurb for this novel.I might come back to the Sam McCain detective novels, but it will be awhile before I forgive Mr. Gorman. Maybe his name should be Mr. Goryman."
2,a real chestnut,"I'm only on page 95 of this book and can barely stomach the cheesey down-homey prose -- truly cringeworthy. The plot seems to be on autopilot. If you want a really good serial killer thriller, stick with thomas harris or even patricia cornwall."
3,Half-hearted update to the Quadrant Solution,"All of this is covered in ""The Quadrant Solution"" by the same authors. TQS was better in that it covered a technology example. Also, it has lot more detail on how to discern the quadrant the product/customer relationship is in (without some of the,IMHO,distracting ""ancient-egyptian"" spin on things). The best in TQS (also covered here) is a description of the four personality types that are effective in each of the quandrants. Recommend TQS as a second read, if you don't have time skip this just go to the TQS."
3,Less boring than expected,Read a few sales books and you'll find them repetitive. That's why novelty helps. This book uses a story to explain how having a great invention doesn't lead to instant sales. Success requires different salespeople and different sales approaches as a product moves from a novelty to a commodity. You already know that but a reminder can't hurt.The audio version is more entertaining since different voices are used for the different characters.
5,Review 1,"This is an excellent sale training book told in a format that made it extremely interesting. The ""story"" format allowed the reader to entertained and learn at the same time."
3,Interesting chronicle of the historic Chisholm Trail,"The Chisholm Trail was named after Jesse Chisholm although this fictional novel concerns his son, Tin, mostly. Not a whole lot about the trail itself but more about his romance with a New Orleans belle."
5,Christmas preparations,"Loaded with great suggestions for a more enjoyable and less stressed out Christman - just like the title says! Also, excellent worksheets in the back to keep you organized and on track."
5,Professor - Harvard Business School,"Excellent book! This book provides an insightful understanding of the importance of relationships in everything that we do in organizations. It offers a critical, yet helpful, eye on negotiations, strategic alliances, and a variety of other contemporary management topics."
1,"Serious Fairy, serious flaws","Do not waste your time on this toy. We purchased this toy for my 4yo yesterday. Withing 3 minutes of removing it from the package, the legs fell off. Considering it was meant for children over the age of 3 you would think it would be constructed a little better. Luckily the store took it back."
4,fairie-fan,"I purchased this and several other Fairy Friends last Christmas for my 3 year-old daughter & will continue to purchase them. -Including the latest additions such as Dulcie, Pluck & Iris, ...along with whatever they'll be releasing in accompaniment to the upcoming movie ""Tinkerbell"".The dolls themselves are very small (only 3.5 inches) and their wings are thin & fluttery & flexible as stated on the package. They could easily be ripped off if handled rough, though I'm sure you could do so with many toys. These petite dolls in particular are not designed to withstand rough play & wrestling competitions with kid-brother's GI Joe's. They are ""pretty"" little things created with small details (such as sparkling skirts & barbie-like hair) and are great for pretend play, even without the larger home/fort things, sold seperately. -My daughter plays with them all the time along with some inexpensive dollhouse accesories. Of all 12 dolls, only one has suffered a torn wing since last Christmas."
4,Good product,"Great for what we needed it for. It came with one shattered bottle and one broken cork, but thankfully we didn't need that many."
1,Does Not Fit,"This lens cover does not fit the trucks it is advertised to. I have a '98 S-10 and this lens cover is at least 3/8"" shorter than the OE lens cover. Also, the enclosed bulbs are a size too big."
3,Sorry but no real Texas Cowboy that I have ever known would cook any of this,"I love the beautiful photos of real cowboys- a nice pictorial history. I am sure the recipes actually taste good, and I am not accusing Grady of not being a real cowboy, I am sure he was. But sadly to me, he continues the trend of taking traditional food, which was fairly simple and tasty in itself, and re-inventing it to make it fancy restaurant fare. Like Barbecued Quail Tamales with Avocado Cream. I ordered it looking for some classic dishes that are so very good, that I might actually make. I started to order another of his books, that has a great title- just what I am looking for, but now really don't think so. I am sorry- a lot of people would love this, the contents just don't seem to go so well with the title. Perhaps 'The Modern Texas Kitchen' would have been better."
1,Arrived broken,"Unfortunately, this racing set was our son's most wanted item last Christmas. It was the first gift assembled once the last box was opened. Right from the box it didn't work properly. Only one car would move. The other didn't go at all. We believe that there was a wiring problem either in the controller or the track. We contacted the seller immediately and were gratified that they issued a refund with no hesitation."
1,"Very, very disappointed",We love Mario Kart but this toy is a disappointment. We owned other racing tracks before and they are all working well. The racing kart is not a new concept but we cannot believe they cannot make this Mario Kart working right. We cannot believe that the manufacture put this product out to the market without testing it. We bought it at Fry's Electronic for $[...] for Christmas gift but returned it to the store immediately after testing it. Do not recommend anybody to buy it. This product is Made in China. The Kart won't stay on the track even you drive very slowly.
1,Disappointing gift?!?!,We were so excited about this gift since my kids love Mario Race Video games. What a huge disappointment...your lucky if you can keep your car on for one lap at a slow pace. Cute concept but I'm really surprised it made it to production since the cars dont even make it around the first turn without falling off the track.
1,No fun at all,We have not been able to get this track to work. It seems pretty simple to put together but when all the pieces are right. The cars still won't run. I am very disappointed.
2,What you pay for is really what you get,"I wanted to buy a Car Kit to listen to my MD player inside my car. After browsing around the web, I found this Coby Car Kit Adapter which had everything I needed at a good low price. I ordered it immediately. After it arrived, I plugged the adaptor in my cigarette lighter to test it out and the fuse burned out. I was going to send it in to the manufacturer but realized that they actually charge you 10$ shipping and handling on this item. Thus, I just took it apart and realized it was only the fuse and bought another one at radio shack and it seems to be working fine right now. Besides that, the sound quality isn't too bad."
5,cd converter,casette to cd converter.Item works great.I never suspected such great audio using this adapter.What is amazing how it transfers audio by pressing one pickup head against the original head in the casette player!
2,power adapter fail,I have had this product for about 3 weeks and the cassette adapter still works (occasionally it takes a second try to make it load but not a real issue there). My big complaint is that the power adapter stopped working within the first week (the light still comes on but no power makes it to the cd player)! The main reason that I bought this kit is because it is the only one I saw that came with a power adapter so I would not have to burn through batteries just trying to listen to cds in my car. So now I am back to burning through batteries and am so disappointed that I will think twice before purchasing another Coby product.
2,"Good concept, poor frequency response","I like the ability to connect devices to my car stereo, but was very disappointed with the poor quality of the audio."
2,Didnt Last long,"Thats about it, it started clicking,or didnt play, Ihad it connected to my Sansa MP3 player, as a side note Ifound a Sony car adapter I had for a previous car, and it hasnt stopped working.I am always surprised when something doesnt work I guessI have to much trust in the endless glut of electronic crapdoes Toyota ring a bell?"
2,Not for the Techy Illilterate,We tried with no success to learn how-to set this up in the car without shocking us.
1,Did not work,I bought this for my husband for Christmas along with the CD player for his car. From the first time he tried it we could not get it to work. Not sure if it was the adapter or the CD player but we ended up returning both for a refund.
1,Broke on day 1,"I bought this product and it worked great for the first hour or so of use. After that it started skipping on a song and then it cut out the singers' voices all together. DON'T BUY THIS, ITS A PIECE OF JUNK!"
1,Product never received,"I ordered this product on May 31, 2004 and today is July 5th and I still haven't received it. I was told because I used regular mail to have it shipped that it was basically my fault that I don't have it. The postal service doesn't take over a month to ship a product from eastern pa to western pa.I am very dissatisfied with the customer service I have received to date...."
1,Somethings wrong with these cameras,"I bought the kodak C643. and by the third day it stopped working.I had to go through the hassle of sending it back.Amazon was cool about sending another camera (same kind)after they recieved my return.On the third day...the second camera went blank, nothing worked.I had to ship that one back too.When I asked Amazon about these cameras they wrote and told me:(I copied and pasted their words to this review)""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item; however,I cannot guarantee when the error may be fixed""They said as soon as they recieve my return they will give me my gift certifcate back and I can pick another camera.Amazon did all they could to help me. I was very impressed about the way they treated me.But this camera stinks."
5,Great camera for even a beginner,"I bought this for my parents, and they were very pleased with how easy it was to use. Also, the large LCD screen and docking station makes it simple for those who are not too friendly with the computer to use."
5,6.1 megapixels for less than $ 150,"I purchased this camera this summer for $150. For some reason, this camera dropped in price during the summer. I heard that it was being discontinued. This is my 2nd Kodak digital camera. My first one took great pics, so I did not hesitate to buy the 643 model. I took this camera to Ft. Walton, Florida and it took pictures with fantastic color. I tried the long exposure taking pics at the pool during the evening. Those turned out very nice also. I don't use the video much. Any vibration in your hands(s) will show up in the video. My camcorder has Steady Shot to eliminate this. I use a 1 GB memory card which will hold 4,000 pics at 1024x768 resolution. The menu system is easy to navigate through. I have not tried all of the camera functions yet. I highly recommend this camera for less than $150."
3,Be careful if buying used,"I purchased this camera used so I could save some money and it arrived way more scratched up than I ever expected. I never thought buying something through Amazon could be ""so used"". My daughter is happy with it so far. There are things she hasn't figured out because it didn't come with any user instructions at all. Had I known this was how the camera would arrive I would have spent more money to get one that wasn't scratched up and had all of the instructions with it."
2,Unpredictable,"My main problem with this camera is that the picture quality is very unpredictable. Some pictures come out perfectly clear, while others are extremely blurry. I've found that the pictures without needing a flash have better clarity. My hand is very steady, so I know it's not a matter of moving during the shot. My previous camera, which was a different brand, never had these problems. I would not recommend this camera and am currently shopping for a different one."
3,SLOWER and LESS VIVID than lesser Kodaks from the past,"I have been a Kodak guy for sometime. I sold $100,000 professional Digital Cameras before most of you knew Digital Cameras existed. So I have an eye for color and what Digital is and does.This camera is slower to respond to the shutter button than others I have owned from Kodak that were supposedly lesser cameras. It has nothing to do with memory speed. I am referring to the act of simply STARTING the shot capture. Too much delay.Also the color is less vivid but more importantly not as accurate as supposedly lesser Kodak cameras I have owned. It just seems like as time marches on they expect us to expect less. Good enough is fast becoming the standard."
2,People who thought this was a nice camera haven't tried other brands,"The Kodak C643 is a pretty crappy camera. That sums it up. I bought this camera to replace my Canon Digital ELPH because it was inexpensive and has a lot of megapixels. You definitely get what you pay for. The camera is very light, which is not a good thing. It's made of cheap plastic. The pictures it takes are of very low quality. The flash makes objects appear washed out, even when the subject is 10 feet away. Low-light pictures are awful. They turn out with a brown tinge. My four-year-old Canon could make low-light pictures look not too bad.In short, pay a couple of extra bucks and buy a Canon. You'll be much happier and your pictures will turn out better."
3,Disappointed,"I wanted to warn potential buyers of this camera that, unless you have ideal lighting conditions, the resulting photos will be grainy. I've tried many things to get better interior pictures with this camera, but am still disappointed."
1,Will never buy anything from Kodak every again,"I purchased this camera on June 17, 2006. It worked great at first with a big LCD screen and with a memory card I could take what seemed like an unlimited amount of pictures and videos.However in January when in Disney World, all of a sudden the screen had blue lines across it in every which way and half the screen was black. I called Kodak and explained that I did nothing to the camera to cause this, and they fixed it for me.And then yesterday the exact same thing happened, again, while I was on vacation. And since it was one week over a year old, the warranty is void and I'm basically screwed, and now I'm wasting my entire day off from work looking for a new one.In addition, the quality of the pictures even at the highest quality is horrible, as they are blurry and look smeared.I will never buy another Kodak as long as I live."
1,Unreliable,"Camera diedThis review requires that I write ten more words. Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word."
4,Awesome,"I love this camera. It can zoom and has several settings for different distances and lighting. It's good day or night, near or far. The only downfall is that it uses batteries very quickly. You need to change the batteries after every 3 uses."
1,outstanding,The item I ordered was as it was described in the add. It arrived in a timely manor and in excellent condition.
3,Kodak EasyShare C643,"This camera is very reasonably priced, if all it's features worked correctly.....Although the camera takes very nice pictures, there seems to be a problem with the video clip feature. I originally thought that it may have been a problem with the particular camera I was sent, however, I exchanged it and had the same problem with the new one. When reviewing the video clips right on the camera, all appears to work well. But, when downloading it to the computer clips are not viewable. I've even contacted Kodak about this and was told to try a different series camera that C series were not made for video. Then why would it have this feature, I wonder? Not to mention, about a year ago, I had an earlier C series model and the video clip feature worked great!"
1,Worst camera ever made,"I have owned this camera since January and have YET to take a camera that is not blurry.I get the ""red hand"" in every single picture. Even with a tripod. I have tried every setting, every lighting, inside, outside, you name it and I NEVER get a clear picture. Not a single one.Needless to say, I am beyond disappointed and will NEVER buy another kodak camera."
3,Quite disappointed,"Well the first one I had got water behind the LCD while I was vacationing in Cape Cod...and no, it wasnt dropped in water, it was just the humidity. Kodak claimed that I needed to be careful in the future and not bring the camera into an environment where there was a lot of moisture...THANKS! So the camera was replaced with a refurbished one, and this one is driving me nuts.The first one never had an issue with the Autofocus, but the second one has alot of trouble in low lighting...it cant catch the image in order to focus. Needless to say, Kodak customer service has been good to me. They pay to fix it and send it back promptly. The process is pretty flawless; they even send you emails updating you on the progress. But I will never buy another Kodak camera again. This camera has been a headache. I should have listened to the guy at Best Buy and gone with another brand...he warned me about Kodak cameras."
1,KODAK EASY SHARE C643,The worst camera I've ever owned. Picture quality is horrible. A very bad Camera indeed. I will never buy any Kodak camera anymore. Highly disappointed. I bought this Camera almost 2 years now and I get horrible pictures whenever used. I am going for a Canon or Sony camera.
4,Like the Camera and the Printer,"I got this as a gift in June and didn't use it until the next month at a party. The camera worked fine but then I guess that I left it on for too long because the battery ran down after less than 20 photos. My next mistake was putting it away for several months without trying to learn how to use it properly. It seemed too much of an effort as opposed to my previous digital camera.In October, I made an effort to learn how to use this camera and printer and...voila! Now I love them both. The LCD screen is a great improvement over the HP digital camera I had before. This Kodak is actually mostly self explanatory and the printer works fine.The Kodak Gallery is easy to use and is helpful when you need to share lots of photos."
1,Can I Give It Zero Stars?,"Yea, I know, what did I expect from such a cheep camera. Pictures that are not grainy for one. Pictures that were sharper then my old 3.1 mp Fuji for two.The image quality on this camera is pure garbage. I just compared my old Fuji with this camera and it is not evern close. 6.1mp on this camera? Where?Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. I have no idea what I was thinking buying a Kodak.You have been warned."
3,sexy hostess,this film has some funny and some very sexy clips from some foreign and U.S. films. Humor abounds as does some very sexy women and some men. Juile Strain is featured and is in top form!....
3,One Heavy Wedge,The shoe is cute. But it's REALLY heavy. They must have put stones in the wedge :)It's tolerable if the shoe actually fits. I'm a size 5..sometimes 5.5. Chinese Laundry did not offer either of those in this model. So I tried a 6. Way huge. I sent these back.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this as a gift to my wife to replace the clock radio we currently have in the kitchen. Mounting the unit was simple enough. Connecting up to my cable system seemed to work, but the viewing angle for the TV seems pretty limited and the sound was not very good. I connected the FM radio antenna and the reception and sound quality for the radio was terrible. Our old clock radio was much better. I also don't like the fact that the TV always comes on when you turn on the power - I might like to go straight to the radio, but that doesn't appear to be an option. I should have heeded the reviews I read stating this product is flakey. I guess the technology for this type of thing just isn't ready for prime time yet. I returned the unit."
3,Good,"This product was easy to install, easy to use, and very compact. It works great in small spaces, and deliveres great picture for the price. GOOD BUY!"
2,You will need an extended warranty!,We purchased this item about 8 months ago and now it is completely broken. The TV no longer works and the speakerphone never worked properly. They only offer a 90 day warranty so... out of luck! I suggest waiting until the technology is better or getting an extended warranty if you can. Wish I had...
4,Oh My!,"You will never look at seafood or a Rosary the same again! Other recovering-Catholics will either be amused or terrified! No more side shows for me, that's for sure (unless they would let me join) :-)"
5,The most significant film of the century!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Any one who thinks this is a horrible film has a horrible sense of humor. Multiple Maniacs is probably the most ground-breaking independent anti-art film ever. It's jet black humor surpasses any movie that was made before or since. John Waters at his best!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"The horror, the horror","Oh god! I recently sat down with a group of film students to watch what will Haunt my dreams for the rest of my days. This movie was outright horrible. It wasn't shocking, wasn't offensive (ok, to me at least, maybe for your Mom) and wow did it make me wanna die. I have never felt so strongly about a movie before. I hate Multiple Maniacs with my entire soul. You gotta see it."
3,John Waters Early Days,"Waters made this movie on a shoestring budget, and it was obviously a short string. It's great if you like his early works (this was right before Pink Flamingos). The lesbian scene in the church is hilarious, unless you're a Christian. The most creative use of a rosary that I've ever heard of. No kidding.Unfortunately, the video is jumpy and doesn't track too well. There's a lot of backgrond noise."
