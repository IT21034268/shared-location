5,Sagan's final work. It's sad to see him go.,"A very enjoyable book. While it is not anything new to this reader, it is still entertaining to read a master write about science and the world as we know it. I will miss Carl Sagan."
3,"Last articles by a ""generalist""","The articles that impressed me where the ones on global warming, theozone hole and ""The Rules of the Game"". This last article could have been transformed into something important if it had been put into a set of game matrices: his five rules defines alternative strategy games.In "" The Common Enemy"" the editorial censorship of even a well knownand well received scientist is plain. It seems strange that people who have only limited background in science, but are literature trained both choose and edit documents by technologically trained ""great"" scientists'?I think that the graph on page 110 of long term historical global temperature that shows our current temperature is on the 'geological"" scale as a maximum may be the most telling page in the book.Carl Sagan to the last was true to his science."
5,forceful and persuasive,"Sagan covers much more than environmental issues in this book. However, his writing is so forceful and persuasive on environmental issues that this theme overshadows all others in my mind. Before reading this work, I was under the impression that global warming was still a theory and that things were happening so slowly that there was little need for action. Now I'm convinced that we are in the midst of a global crisis, a crisis with the potential for the most catastrophic and irreparable of consequences. The issues covered here are of extreme importance. We all have a responsibility to be informed. Please read at least part 2 of this book, which runs from pages 75 to 178."
5,"Feel Smarter, BE smarter !","Thoroughly enjoyed this. Sagan never claims to have ALL the answers, but encourages the reader to think in a non-conventional fashion. As a community college instructor of the Natural Sciences, I appreciate Sagan's ability to describe and relate the micro- and macroscopic nature of the universe. Each chapter reads well on its own. Especially enjoyed the chapter on the myths of Croseus and Cassandra and their applicability to today's political approach towards current environmental and social issues."
2,Not Expected,"I bought this cd like two years ago hoping it'd be great. it's sad to say i found it rather boring... maybe some people like it, i just don't."
5,Still a great guide after all these years-- B. Neuwirth,"Although The Essential Feature was published in 1990, it is still extremely useful, well written and interesting. I am surprised, however, that the publisher has not issued an updated version reflecting the changes that have taken place in the writing field.Vicky Hay was by far the best English professor I have ever had, and many of the ""tricks of the trade"" she taught us in class are in this book. The suggested reading lists after each chapter are particularly helpful. I also appreciate the Appendixes, which include Basic Punctuation Rules, Twenty Rules for Good Writing, Useful Editor's Marks, a Glossary of Magazine and Newspaper Terms, and more. There is something here for everyone."
2,Worst Delorme Atlas,"Delorme's Nevada Atlas and Gazeteer does not approach the quality of its other western states atlases. Users will be disappointed to discover that contour lines are rarely labelled. There is no distance scale, either on the pages or in the key - an oversight which would produce an automatic 'F' in introductory cartography. Furthermore, land ownership status is not indicated on the maps by color coding as with other atlases - instead there is only a single statewide page which is essentially useless. Finally, the maps on each page run to the edge with approximately a half-inch overlap between pages. Although convenient for inexperienced map users - it is a source of frustration for those with greater map experience. If you really need a Nevada atlas, then get this one. Otherwise, wait until Delorme reissues a new edition correcting its most serious flaws."
1,Road condition accuracy is completely unacceptable,"As other reviewers have noted, some roads were poorly marked ""other state route or major connector""; when we got to some of these roads they were dirt, and labelled ""unmaintained"" and ""use at own risk"". In addition, I am fairly sure that some of the roads marked on the maps do not exist. We looked for a couple of turnoffs off SR 160, twice going back and forth where they were supposed to be, without seeing them.This inadequate accuracy made the atlas worse than useless, since it cost money and time."
2,Get the Benchmark atlas.,"In the other cases where I have compared DeLorme & Benchmark side by side (California, New Mexico, Arizona), I prefer DeLorme. Not this time. As other reviewers have mentioned, BLM land is not marked in the main body of the atlas, only in the whole-state map; this alone makes the atlas nearly useless for those interested in exploring public lands. Benchmark's marking of public lands at a coarse scale in their ""recreation maps"", but not in the finer scale ""landscape maps"" is not ideal, but it is workable; DeLorme's approach for Nevada is not. I also notice that Benchmark includes more campgrounds (including one I stayed at last summer south of Silver Springs) and other fine detail for Nevada than DeLorme, whereas in other cases the opposite is true. Elsewhere in the west, stick with DeLorme. For Nevada, get the Benchmark."
2,Many errors,"Took a number of non-roads shown as roads in this atlas and almost became stranded once. Also missed some interesting roads not shown in this atlas. I later reviewed these errors in the other brand atlas of the same size and found them ALL to be correct in that atlas. I continually find errors in the California, New Mexico, and Nevada versions of the DeLorme atlases. I have since converted my usage to the other brand."
4,Great trip planning tool,"I use the Delorme Gazetteers, including this one, for planning my fishing trips every year. They include comprehensive coverage of the state in question with sufficient detail to identify all the major topological features one will find, including streams and lakes. Also, they show all the roads. One criticism is that they don't contain road mileages between locations, unlike a highway atlas. But, a highway atlas will not show topographic coutour lines, or indicate locations where one may launch kayaks or rafts, or show locations reputed to have good fishing. I keep a Delorme Gazetteer for each state in which I expect to travel on any extended drive. They enable me to find campgrounds (in the indexes and shown on the maps), roads, topography, and all the essentials to plan a trip."
1,misleading,"Thank goodness for survival skills! This atlas suggested a road going north from Black Rock Desert was graded gravel, but it turned into a challenging 4 wheel track. I triple checked GPS coordinates along the way, so my position was correct. What should have been a 1/2 day drive at most turned into 8+ hours with an overnight roadside stay. This Atlas would be better for target practice than back road navigation. One good quality is the overlap from one page to another, saving page flipping when traveling along roads that border the page edge. Don't buy this Atlas! Look for another publisher or go BLM."
3,Elexorien Sword,"This product is very dissapointing in that it is being advertised falsely, when I recieved the product it did not contain an art print as is advertised in the product description. Other than that there is nothing wrong with the product."
4,the white jesus,Jeff hunter was a excellent actor who died way too young. This movie was pretty well made the only thing that in hindsight one could say that is wrong with it is taht jesus was a brown skinned man from the middle east. But in truth the message jesus gave us was color blind so it wouldn't matter if a chinese man played him. If you see it today noone could imagine that critics said it was made for teenyboppers because it's a solid movie about the jesus story. The print looks good on this one and that's a good thing as many biblical epics from this era have prints that look pretty bad. especially foriegn movies. So This one is worth having and reflecting on jesus christ regardless of the lead actors color.
5,Jeffrey Hunter is very beautiful.,"This movie is very beautiful.Music is gentle, Jeffrey's jesus is very charming.And all characters in this movie, are very cute.Jesus in this movie, is gentle and beautiful.Jeffrey Hunter is No1 beautiful acter, in the world.He is very beautiful,pretty,smart,charming,and cute.This is my favorite movie.I have been watch this movie one hundred times.New testament will be happiness hundred-fold.I love Jeffrey Hunter."
4,GOOD MOVIE,I saw this movie and loved how this one was done but the only reason i'm giving four stars is because they didn't show a lot of Jesus' miracles and cut out the seen where Jesus knocks over the tables in temble.
2,IT'S FUN JUST TO LOOK AT JEFFREY HUNTER AS JESUS CHRIST!!!,"KING OF KINGS IS FUN JUST TO LOOK AT JEFFREY HUNTER AS JESUS CHRIST!!! Unfortunately, the critics displayed their conventional bias against goodlooking actors and blamed Hunter for KING OF KINGS being such a weak movie--it's too long and boring--and then Hunter's career went into a gradual tailspin that was accelerated by his then wife Sandy Bartlett's decision not to allow him to stay on as the Captain of the Enterprise after his appearance in the first Star Trek pilot, and then Hunter stumbled through a series of terrible movies like DIMENSION 5,and SERGENT O'FARRELL OF THE NAVY with Bob Hope, and by 1969 Hunter was dead.But if you want to see Jeffrey Hunter's unusual combination of all American good looks and acting ability see him in STAR TREK's ""The Cage,"" or in KING OF KINGS. Yes, KING OF KINGS is a slow, boring movie, but it's still a lot of fun JUST TO LOOK AT JEFFREY HUNTER AS JESUS CHRIST!!!Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"
1,Shamefully Lame,"If you are looking for a film that even remotely attempts to follow scripture, look elsewhere.It's a shame. Many of the pieces were in place to make a very good movie but when they tossed the Bible in the trash, they blew it."
1,buy it if you like sci fi,"These is the worst film I have seen and I didnt finish it neither. The producer makes so much use of his imagination , in side stories like the time that Jesus Himself went to visit John the baptist at prison? This is a perfect example of someone who had all the resources to make a wonderful scriptural exact movie and decided to go sci fi , hollywood bologny instead.I started to watch it in christian homeschool with my kids and had to stop it and tell the children this was all incorrect.Not for educative purposes and definitively a turn off if you are looking for some veracity.If you like fantasy this is your trip!"
1,one of the worst life's of christ,"rent it first jeff hunter just reads the script no emotion poor acting, great music score by rosza"
1,False Content,"I saw on television. I shut it off at the point where Our Lord is depicted saying, when asked how we must pray, ""..for Thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the glory....""St. Matthew does not record His saying this. Only heretics and schismatics recite this addition.I have read and been told by good traditional priests that it was purloined by a Protestant revisionist from a prayer of Thanksgiving written by, as I recall either St.Jerome or St. Justin (martyr to the Faith)."
5,King of Kings,This movie is a good interpretation of the last years of Jesus. It is only shownon cable during holidays and I wanted to have for my collection. Jeff Hunter isamazing as Jesus; not to mention the fact he's gorgeous. A great movie.
5,"He May Have Been Labeled A Teenaged Jesus, But Hunter's Piercing Blue Eyes Makes You Want To Believe","Epic and excellent tale of Jesus from creation to the resurrection, I love and adore this movie and have watched it so many times over the years.Frank Thring plays a truly crafty and nasty Herod and Robert Ryan a solid John The Baptist.This movie is way too good for just an Easter viewing."
5,the king of kings is the king of the christ movies!!!!,"love the movie...jeffrey hunter makes the best jesus christ of all the religous movies..puts on a great performance.very well done.i can see this movie 10,000 times and i won't get sick of it!!!!\"
5,Clear and great Movie,"I love good clear and bright religous movies. There are some with the same theme, but they were dark, The lightening was very bad, but this one has no issue with this. The movie really had me thinking about why this has happen the way it did. The actors did a great job in their character."
5,King of Kings DVD,I was extremely happy with the purchase of this DVD. It was of extremely good quality and received well before estimated due date :)
5,so well done it brings me 2. tears.,"Have loved this film since fjrst time i ever saw it. Jeff hunter should have rec'd Oscar for his portrayal of Jesus.yes,it was THAT good! Part that brings me 2 tears? Wben he recites tbe Lord's Prayer. I get chills every time!"
5,Best Movie Ever,Of all the movies about the story of Christ in my estimation is one of the best. Read once that in the scene at the crucification there really was a storm that came up and they did not need any special effects to create that.
5,I'm glad to have this dvd,I'm really glad to have this DVD. I couldn't be more pleased. Thankyou so much.
2,"not at all what I expected from a ""classic""","I found the story writing to be scripturally unsound and/or out of context. The plot was either so unbelievable or boring that it was difficult to watch completely through. Nothing at all along the lines of ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""."
3,Review DVD Purchase,"The DVD is fine, however there was no indication that I would be purchasing a DVD that will not work in my region. No warnings. So the DVD is useless in any Region 4 players. (Not everyone lives in region 1).Not satisfied!"
5,I love this film,Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance in this movie about Jesus' life. The best scene is during the Sermon on the Mount.
5,A Classic Film Gets The Blu-Ray Disc It Deserves,"the remastered dvd that Warner Bros. Home Video released of this film say 10?years ago was A+ so i knew the eventual blu-ray disc would be spectacular to saythe least. the crispness, sharpness and clarity of both the picture image(whosecolors are eye catchingly vibrant) and the multi-channel audio tracks show how ablu-ray disc can truely make a widescreen roadshow epic from the 50s or 60s comeexcitedly alive. if you're a fan of the film but have only seen the vhs get thisblu-ray disc. it is without exaggeration like seeing and hearing the film forthe first time.but i do have two gripes. KINGS OF KINGS was a big release for MGM when it wasreleased Oct. of 1961 so i can't believe there are no special features, interviewsetc.... to be had other than what was on the dvd. also why didn't they simplyuse the film's original ad artwork on the cover like the dvd?"
5,King of Kings,Everyone of any age will love this DVD movie. It is a great learning tool for those who don't know the Bible that well. I hadn't seen this movie for years and loved it all over again.
5,My Classic to Behold,"We have many religious movies and I'm not sure why this one did not reach the measure of Ben Hur...another fabulous movie...but from the first time I saw this, I was enraptured. The story of Jesus touches many and I just feel the actors/actress' of this movie were marvelous. Plain and simple, I have loved this movie from day one and now I can enjoy it again without hoping to find it on any tv station."
3,Visually interesting but terribly inaccurate,"I just watched the King of Kings a few moments ago. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Visually, its re-issued version is awesome - the colors and tones are sharp and brilliant. The cinematography was superb. In terms of the production value, it is impressive. Unfortunately, it is so inaccurate in terms of details - culturally and historically. Sadly, there are so many elements that are fictional, they are not found in either scripture nor any historical sources. The large scale attack led by Barabas against the romans, Jesus' visiting of John the Baptist in Prison, are just a few of the things that have been fictionalized. Even the portrayal of the political landscape of the time is so inaccurate. The whole movie is so very theatrical in its presentation that it just lacks a sense of realism. As a movie from the 1960's it is entertaining to watch. But as a religious or biographical film it did not inspire me."
2,You pay for what you get,"As my title says, ""You pay for what you get.""The case can carry my ipod, but I cannot do anything on my ipod touch while in the case, so each time I need to select a song or adjust the volume I have to remove it from the case every time. (very hassling indeed)Did I say you pay for what you get?"
4,Great read for those who can't stop climbing.,"It's a very good book since it walks you through the basics of being a good athlete that focuses strictly on being a climber. It organizes a great work out for those who are able to climb every day and those that can't. Most of it is logic and common sense so for me this book was very entertaining at midnight after a climbing session when I couldn't climb more, I would read this. It filled in the blanks about certain work-out myths and it helped me focus my routine towards climbing.So, is it worth it?? If you searched for it, and you found it, it's probably worth it for you."
4,"Very Good, but...","I bought this and the ""Training for Climbing: The Definitive Guide to Improving Your Climbing Performance"" from the same author and I think it is a lot better than how to climb 5.12 beacause it has everything and a lot more things. I don't regret buying both, but If I knew It maybe I would just buy one of them. But both are excelent."
1,Beware - Bad Release,"Hopefully, they'll clean this up. Right now, it's not ready for prime time. I am a power user with 5 years of data.I work the heck out of this program. I had to reinstall once because it mangled my data. It crashed at least half a dozen times during initial setup. Now that I've got it working, it's lost my online payee info. I don't see anything here I couldn't live without (they didn't make it any easier to update mortgage payments). I'm sorry I broke my own rule -- don't install ""beta"" software. Wait six months!"
3,It's not that bad!,"The earlier reviews on this product scared the beejeepers out of me. I had to upgrade because Intuit was stopping support on the Quicken 2005 I was using. I would no longer be able to download stock prices, transactions from credit card companies, etc. It's their way of extorting more money out their users. They only provide 3 years of download support. Then you either upgrade or enter all the data manually.Overall, the product has not been too bad. So far, I have not found one single feature I would have paid for that makes Quicken 2007 better that the 2005 version. The graphics a little better though - but that is inconsequential.The upgrade was easy, it's stable, and the operation is very similar to 2005. It appears as if all the reviewers were Beta users.While I'm still very peeved at Intuit for forcing the upgrade, the product is not that bad. I wish I had a good alternative, but hate to walk away from 10 years of data in Quicken."
3,A good book to understand the devastation of pornography,"This is a very good book for help in understanding the devastation that pornography can cause in a marriage relationship. The hurt and pain are obvious as is the authors commitment to working the relationship out. The one part I missed was the compassion for the man. Anyone struggeling with this problem in their own life knows how very difficult the whole issue is, and Dr Schaumburgs book on False Intimacy gives good help to those caught up in this addiction."
1,worst book ever,"We were having problems, but this book only made them worse It makes any manwho ever looked at porn or been to bachlor party seem like a sex addict,serial rapist, axe murderer, and an agent of the devil. This book will not helponly make convince a wife to seek a divorce."
1,Not what I expected,"I spent way too much money for what I thought would be a new book that turned out to be used. Furthermore, the content of the book was not what I thought it would be."
1,This book took my emotions downhill fast!,"Why would anyone say this is a helpful book? If it is helpful it is because you have NOT been through the devastation of pornography in your life. My emotions went on a downward spiral which is NOT what I needed. There were no helpful hints on how to get out of it; it only pushed me downward. The only people I can see that might be helped out by this book is the addict. If a spouse is trying to work through the pain [...] of pornography in their life---this book is NOT the one to read. I was so hurt, broken by reading about all the specifics. [....] I cannot recommend this book."
3,"Good Information, Strong Fundamentalist Values","Much of the information included in this book is based on very strong fundamentalist Christian Values. I was looking for something with more focus on how to address the issues which I am living with rather than stories. Also for more practical actions than prayer and scripture. I admit that the book is effective witnessing for those who do not have a relationship with God, but was hoping for more practicality and less preaching."
2,I was disappointed in this book,"While there was some good information in this book the author's viewpoint seemed self-righteous and extremely judgemental. A lot of information that was presented as factual was really just the author's opinion on a select group of academic studies. I was hoping for a better understanding of what the author faced and how she felt, as well as her busband and family but instead felt lectured to. I don't recommend this book."
1,Over religious,"I am a fairly spiritual person, but I cannot get past the third chapter as I am having scripture thrown at me in every paragraph. I am very displeased with my purchase. I would like to confront this serious issue with other means of coping."
5,Recommended reading for every man,"The author writes from the heart, avoiding superficialities, intellectualization and spiritualizing. Her journey has not been smooth or easy ... this is not a success story with a fairy tale ending. I have to disagree, however, with the reviewers who think it is too pessimistic and without hope. The progress seen by the end of the book (which is certainly not the end of the story) is marked and more representative of the healing in addict families than is a quick, happy ending.Good insights on forgiveness, especially regarding the pain that it involves.After reading this book, I found myself wondering whether it should be required reading for pre-marital counseling. Given that the problem is so prevalent, would earlier awareness of the issues promote their resolution before the sexual addiction and family patterns cause such destruction?"
4,Insightful,This book was my first reading on this topic and I found it to be helpful in dealing with the emotions running through a woman's mind when dealing with a pornography addicted husband. It was like she was reading my mind. She was very courageous to write this book! It will help you to sort out those feelings and know that what you're feeling is just like other women.
2,Affair of the mind,"The book was factually correct as to the devastation that porn can cause to a marriage. I was however disappointed that in spite of all that the author did, her husband did not leave pornography. I was looking for a book that provided hope for me, that my marriage can and will survive, but after reading all the negatives, I even became more bitter and hardened against my husband.I decided to leave the book and go back to the bible and God for a solution that works without all the negativity I read.I must say that as a result of my decision, I can see a marked difference in my husband and our relationship. We can even talk more openly about issues."
4,Inspiration to another,I purchased this book for a friend who recently got married. She was very depressed over her husbands porn use and his treameant towards her. I found the title of this book in some christian reading at Bible.com. I found it on Amazon and had to get it for her. We have not talked about it but she tells me she is doing much better and her and her husband are in church now. They have been going together for 3 weeks. I pray this has been a comfort but most of all that God be glorified in all of this.
5,An Affair of the Mind,"I thought this was an excellent book, it was written so well that it grabbed my attention from the beginning, I hope she comes out with more books, not just in this subject, but many other Christian books, she is so anointed and so is this book, and I dont say that about many books. This book is for both the addicted person and for those whom this addiction has effected."
4,An autobiography,The best book I have read on the subject of pornography. It tells the story of a woman whose husband is addicted to porn and [...] and she dosent have a clue of what is happening. The addiction takes her husband away from the family isolating him infact. The children grow without a father around them. The book has had great impacton me. It did teach me a lot though. I am not married yet but God taught me a lot of things through this book. A highly recommended book for both men and women who struggle with Porn and self indulgence
5,Great for the women who think they're alone.,"This book was awesome, it didn't tell me what to do in my situation, but it certainly helped me to know I wasn't the only one suffering.No simple answers, just a very touching story with some great ideas towards self recovery.Awesome reading!"
2,Where's the butter?,"I love butter chicken. I order it almost every time I go to Indian restaurants. I even make it from scratch at home when the craving sets in. I have had A LOT of it. So when I was looking for a quick and easy dinner at the grocery store and found a jar of this stuff, I was pretty excited to take it home. Man, was I let down. This tasted more like barbecue sauce than butter chicken! I even added peppers, onions, curry powder, and cayenne in attempts to make it better. Nope. Just spicy barbecue sauce. Where's the butter!?!"
4,Smells like Butter Chicken...teriffic stuff!,"Maybe the previous reviewer got a bad jar...but this is the second time I've cooked this stuff and it smells and tastes like authentic Butter Chicken to me!An odd thing about us British is that 'traditional' food is now Curry in various forms...it's been hard to find a reliable source of these sauces until recently. Amazon is very reliable...but my local market is now cheaper (by over $1), that's the only reason I knocked off a star...the product is great, the price isn't."
2,Tastes decent...just nothing like butter chicken,"When I think of butter chicken, I think of a smooth, creamy, almost sweet sauce with complex but subtle flavors. This sauce, while it tastes pretty good and is easy to use on chicken, tastes nothing like any butter chicken I've ever had. It tastes more like a red enchilada sauce (yes, as in Mexican food!) with a little bit of Indian spices added in. The flavors are too strong, the texture is thicker and not as creamy, and the mild sweetness is missing."
2,weird smell,"This sauce kind of has a weird unappetizing smell. It smelled bad while it was cooking. I was able to eat the chicken I made only by masking the taste of the sauce with a lot of basmati rice. Maybe the smell is just something I don't like, but I would not buy this product again. The texture of the sauce was fine however."
2,Almost Home,"Since I have followed the case for awhile and read the trial transcripts. I find this book to be a fairy tale made up in Damiens Echols head. Anyone that wants to investigate the case should go to callahan.8k.com, the case transcripts are here, the reader should pay attention to Woods Affadavit, and Exhibit 500, which contain the mental health records of Damien Echols.The book was fairly well written, but its not about Damien Echols. His colorful descriptions, of people are very disturbing, for some reason if you are not one of his celeb friends, you are some low life. To read the true Damien Echols, read the trial transcript, not this made up life he has created."
5,Eloquent and Inspirational,"I just received this book today and could not put it down. Despite having read and watched everything I could find about the West Memphis Three case, to some extent Damien Echols remained an enigma. This book makes it personal. Damien shares his story with honesty, intelligence, and wit. Although this tragedy has been and continues to be devastating to all involved, Damien perseveres with hope and grace. With all the hard work of so many determined supporters, I hope his next book will be about the release and vindication of Damion, Jason and Jessie"
4,Almost Home,I knew all of the people involved in ths story and I have read many books and articles about these boys and the crime. T he book was a couldn't put down. It was interesting to read a book written by one of the accused and get his take on what has happened in his life.
5,Is it all for Profit?,"Love the book and have my own copy however I am curious to know what the sellers on here will be doing with the money they are making off of the sale of their book? Will they be donating it to the West Memphis 3 fund, to Damien Echols or what will you be doing with it?"
4,Excellent and moving autobiography,"This is a book you just can't put down once you start reading it. Even if you've seen the documentaries on the West Memphis Three and read the Everitt book, this autobiography adds so much more in revealing Damien's life up to (and including) his imprisonment, and just how strong a character he has to have survived everything that has been thrown at him to date. Damien's story made me even more angry and frustrated at how he has been treated than I was after seeing the docos and reading Everitt's book, but also made me simply awestruck at how he has come through everything without losing his sanity. He writes in a very flowing/easy to read style, and does not seem to hold back on revealing personal details or feelings along the way. Definitely recommended to anyone, even if you've never heard of the ""West Memphis Three"" case."
5,GREAT READ!!!!,"I started following Damien Echols' story early in 2000. I have seen both Documentaries about his murder case. I never believed he was guilty. But you never get to see the ""real"" Damien in either of those docs. So finally reading a book he wrote about himself was great. I can't wait for him to write another book."
5,Incredible.,This book is absolutely incredible. There are parts that will make you laugh and cry. This book shows the true Damien Echols. By far one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to anybody (whether your interested in the case or not).
5,"Impressed, but Not Surprised","Outside of his unfortunate status as one of the West Memphis Three, Damien has proven himself a person worth knowing. This book discusses his legal situation very little, for obvious reasons (he's still in the appeals process) but that is why I liked it. As a supporter of the WM3, I've wondered a lot about the pre-prison lives of all three men and have wanted to understand them more on a personal level. That is precisely what is accomplished in this book.Interest in his case is not at all necessary to enjoy Damien's book. I would hope, though, that reading this unflinchingly honest and excellently written autobiography would at least create curiosity about it."
1,Free PDF was worth every penny!!,"I read this book after I found a FREE pdf file of it online. Man is this book amazing. If you are interested in reading it, let me know with a comment below.I am so glad to see these guys out of prison. iliveforhim1976 at the mail that starts with a G. Let me know if you want to read it.iliveforhim1976"
4,Being objective...,"I read this book without being influenced of what has happened in Damien's past. For some reason, I was able to do that. I don't know why, but I just didn't think this book was wonderful or all that great, but not horrible either. I hope Damien keeps on writing though. I think he's a very smart man.I think had I been thinking the whole time about what's happening with Damien now, I would have given it a better review (but I'm not saying anything bad about the people who gave it five stars). However, people should read this book anyway. The whole feel that I got from the book was that here was a teenager who was just living his life, then it was ripped away. Whether he did it or not, none of us truly know that, but the point is that it's a sad, sad state that he's living in, and justice wasn't served. What happened to him could have happened to a lot of us, and we could be where he is right now."
3,No need to get if you've read life after death,"This is essentially a rawer version of large portions of Life After Death. What makes it interesting is since it didn't (assumedly) have pr people checking final drafts, it comes across as angrier and more judgmental of Echols surroundings and circumstances, (he really seems to hate fat people!) which is interesting but not compelling enough to spend $50-$100 on, especially since you'd be buying it from a reseller.If Echols rereleases it, I'd say go for it, otherwise it's not really necessary to read this if you've read Life After Death"
4,"A Nice Collection, Not Great But...","If you are a fan of the music found on the Tommy Boy Label from 1981 to 1996 then this compilation will have you walking down ""Memory Lane""... A number of tracks on Volume 4 make it a nice addition to any Hip Hop collection but odds are if you are a fan then you probably have most of the tracks in this collection already.I think Tommy Boy would have done us a better service if their ""Greatest Beats"" were just Beats and Instrumentals to the songs.One nice thing about this collection is the ""Mixman"" software included on the CD."
4,Nice watch,"Stylish design and received some compliments. If it only had a backlight feature, then that my rating would have been 5*."
4,Knees,"I have to say this product worked out pretty well --Although I wish I could find a cheap knee brace where the cold pack was actually built into the brace more securely - this works well.It has two cold packs in it that velcro in and out - I put mine in the refrigerator instead of the freezer, because I don't want to have to put anything between the brace and me knee.I use these pretty much 5 times a week after hard work outs and it significantly reduces any kind of knee troubles I have been having.If you are looking for a solution I would try this one out."
2,don't buy,"The video on this dvd is terrible. It's not as long as stated The first video of the Jackson 5 is so grainy you can't even really tell it's the Jackson 5 or who it is. The only decent part is when Michael is doing ""man in the mirror"" at the awards. Most any thing else on the dvd is on the Live in Bucarest (not spelled correct) and with much better sound and video quality. Use your money on something worth while and NOT THIS DVD."
5,"Soft wonderful plush toy, fun to enjoy and give to grandkids","Bought this for our grandaughter for Christmas as she is a huge fan of Pugs. Amazingly, it was the only one she got [she got 4] that EXACTLY resembled the Pug in her mind.So thank you, shipped well, all went smoothewill work with them again"
2,I thought and wish this was a live concert,"This was a promotional dvd for an artist who needs no hype; the resalution was less than 1080i. Overall, I liked looking Ashunti; but, I wish she would have given a full lenght concert."
1,dang it's really bad,she has one or two songs I've caught myself humming but what has she done that's so special that makes her the princess? Maybe I should read a book on computers and call myself a computer engineer when I'm done!
2,RAISE TO PRINCESS OF HIP HOP,I was desparate to see a music dvd by this talented young lady and was very disappointed with this poor quality dvd with still pictures and bad lighting. It was interesting to hear the running commentory but it would be better to actually hear ashanti singing and doing what she does best.
1,I Hate Her!!!!,Please save your money and buy something usefulDon't put another dime in this talentless trick's pocket...She can't sing ..she can't dance..I hate her gutsHave A Nice Day!!
2,Teenage live journal,"I was disappointed. I bought this book because it was interesting for me to read what a New-York poet can tell me about Queen poetry, Queen meaning for the world. But instead it I found a live journal of 12-years old teenager who even cannot tell what he want to say. Today I eat my soup and thought about Brian May. Looking to my picture disk -how are you, Roger? And this kind of thoughts from the beginning to the end. If it's good tribute from American writer -my condolences to modern American literature. Queen didn't deserved so poor tribute. Shame."
1,What has the world come to???,"OMG, the title must be true - stars are blind alright! Especially Paris Hilton who thinks that this will sell! This is so manufactured and bad that I can't believe it! ""If you show me yours I'll show you mine"". Come on Paris..... how stupid! Don't buy this or her album."
1,Stolen music from Hollywoods #1 fraud,The music from this song is stolen bar by bar from UB40's Kingston Town. All they did was drop on new lyrics and add a chorus. But it is a complete rip off of UB40. Nothing about this girl is original.
4,"Not a bad first song for Paris, really!!","I didn't know what to think when the radio said ""...here's the first single from Paris Hilton..."", but I listend and liked it. Granted she's no Madonna or Whitney Houston, but it's pretty good! The beat makes you wanna dance and it's pretty laid back with its reggae-esque sound.To all you people who are whining and complaining because it's Paris Hilton, just shut up! She has as much right as everyone else to make a record. You're probably just jealous because you're a bloated former highschool football player that can't even get a skank to look at you. PWNT."
1,Please go away....,"I find her voice.... annoying... and when I heard it on the radio, it was almost enough to make me run off the road. She has now shown us that she can do everything in the world.... unless it involves tallent. She should stick with ""The Simple Life"". At least there, it was AMUSING to act like an idiot."
1,Someone pedigree this skanky hosebeast!,"Triple H: What the Hell is music coming to, Paris Hilton has a record out? Shawn Michaels: Apparently so my man and it s*cks. Triple H: We are not referring to her sucking d*cks or c*cks neither(which she is superb at as her One Night in Paris film attests) but her singing is a joke. Shawn Michaels: This girl got famous for being a heiress, what the Hell is a heiress. Triple H: Who gives a f*ck, I thought she got famous for having blink one second and miss affairs with married women's husbands, Puff Daddy and that dog who looks like a rat and would get killed with one kick in the head! Shawn Michaels: No, she got famous for shooting up with Nicole Richie and her l*sb* friends. Triple H: Stars Are Blind is awful and if this is music then may I shoot myself. Shawn Michaels: ME TOO! Triple H and Shawn Michaels says if you are not down with D-X, we got TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells S*CK IT!)"
3,disappointing,it would have been nice to describe that the product is simply a piece of paper stapled to a board. looks a lot more professional in the picture.
3,"nice bag, but not very big","I bought this bag to tote my clothes and stuff to and from the gym. it's a great bag, but there isn't enough room to fit all of my stuff in it (work out clothes, shoes, shampoo/conditioner, soap, ipod and wallet).. so I ended up buying another bag which doesn't seem that much bigger, but is designed to fit more stuff in it."
2,I didn't get it,"Man's Search for Meaning is my bible for life. I so anticipateddigging into Volume 2, couldn't imagine it could get anybetter, it didn't.You need a PHD in Pysch to read the first page and I onlymade it to Chapter 4 and I couldn't figure out what hewas even trying to say. The verbage alone requires adictionary, but my arm got tired looking up every otherword.What happened???His first book was so rich in real life examples andtouching experiences I was filled with tears of joy.This book is as if Victor lived his whole life inthe ivory tower talking to other suits.Oh well, vita continua."
2,Esoteric,"Read several positive reviews of this book; my assessment is the subject matter is certainly interesting however the presentation text contains a considerable number of ""terms of art"" that I simply have not been exposed to making for a complex read."
5,Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning,"The author, through his research and personal experiences, has undoubtedly left me to think. His propositions and explanations do require time to digest. For any one seeking out more light, this is a great book to purchase."
2,if you have a degree in psychology...then try it...,i simply could not read beyond 10 pages... the sheer use of psychiatric words without any pretext will drive you mad... only meaning out of life i could get is that it is very complex just like the book....
3,Better to hear a lecture!,"(DrEwgog, Croton NY)Some very good bits and some passages that warrant meditation for months to come, but the first third or so seems to be a wading in the weeds with far too little development for the layman`s understanding. Clearly the opening third is directed at a very specific audience upon which the shorthand would not be lost. But for the rest of us I would recommend rereadin ""M`s S for M"" rather than this ""ultimate"" trip."
5,The True Story Of The Hall of Fame,At first I expected this book to be an argument over the merits of certain players. Who should and who shouldn't be in the hall of fame. I couldn't have been more delighted to find out that while the book does contain those arguments it actually functions as a history of the hall of fame.I have to agree with Bill James that their are a lot of players whose plaques don't belong in Cooperstown. James not only tells you why they don't belong but tells you of the good ole boy network that got them in there. His chapter on the Frankie Frisch saga at the hall is very enlightening while his argument over the merits (or lack thereof)of Phil Rizzuto is hard to debate.If you are one of those who debates who should be in the hall of fame with your buddies than this book is for you. After reading it I have no doubt that Ron Santo is the best player not in the hall (with the exception of Pete Rose and Joe Jackson). This book will tell you why.
4,Worthy Effort,"This book does a good job of showing that a lot of Hall-of-Famers don't deserve to be in the museum. It also does a good job of telling fun anecdotes and tales. But overall, it seems to be just a little bitter and not all that important. Much as James would like to influence the Hall's selections, it ain't gonna happen and he doesn't give a compelling enough reason for significant change. Interesting, but not up to five-star callibre."
4,A good primer.,"As a prospective first-time property purchaser, I found this book to contain some good information on the particulars of condos and townhouses. I did not read the section on Co-ops however. Parts of the book seemed to contain redundant information, not necessarily for emphasis. Perhaps the chapters were intended to be somewhat self-contained. ""Buying a home for Dummies"" has been my first resource. I'd recommend reading something like it first in order to fully appreciate the differences w/condos and townhouses described in this book."
3,"Rookie cop sharpens her ""people skills""","In THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, a rookie cop (Lea Thompson) who graduated the academy with highest grades experiences her first night shift at the precinct house. Eight people are booked for far-ranging reasons (a drunk driver, a crossdresser, a KKKer, a mugger, a man who helped his terminally ill wife commit suicide, etc.). Good cast is featured in TV movie based on a play that is by turns humorous, melancholy, thought-provoking and preachy.(Not available on DVD.)In the biggest hit movie of 1985,BACK TO THE FUTURE(and its two sequels), Lea Thompson played Michael J. Fox's girlfriend.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(6.0) The Right To Remain Silent (TV-1996) - Lea Thompson/Robert Loggia/Carl Reiner/LL Cool J/Judge Reinhold/Amanda Plummer/Patrick Dempsey/Laura San Giacomo"
4,One of the greatest books,This is one of those book that you can't put down. Evelyn Waugh is one of the great writers of all time. His way with word is truly brilliant. This book is a must read and a must buy.
4,Not Just a Cautionary Book for Aspiring Journalists,"This is not Waugh doing Waugh so much as it is Waugh doing Wodehouse (the Jeeves the Butler author). Shows you what Waugh is like when he's actually nice to his characters. Chirpingly silly, this one was written for the masses, not for Those Who Understand - this ain't no ""Brideshead."" But it's still devilishly clever and entertaining - ""B"" Waugh perhaps, but still better than the ""A"" work of a lot of other authors."
5,Great Fun,"Waugh's books are serious literature, of course--they show a fine sense of structure, a masterful command of prose, and a charming condemnation of the foibles of his (and our) day supported by a genuine understanding of the world.However, as Crispin's witty mouthpiece Gervase Fen remarks in BURIED FOR PLEASURE, reading Waugh for philosophy is missing the point; his books are FUNNY. SCOOP is one of his most hilarious, making great comic fodder of the pretensions of journalism, politics, and England. One remarkable thing about Waugh is that he is a biting satirist who doesn't seem to dislike even the targets he attacks most ruthlessly--they remain humans rather than straw men, which makes the point better than any mere caricature could possibly manage."
5,Another Winner,"Ms. Waugh continues to impress. I picked up this one in Brazil and went cover to cover. Her send up of journalism is dead on. It reminds me of Christopher Klim's Jesus Lives in Trenton for pacing, comedy, and style."
3,A blend of P.G. Wodehouse and Art Buchwald.,"But not, I'm sorry to say, as entertaining as a romp with Bertie and Jeeves or as outrageous as a Buchwald column. The story centers on the wrong Mr. Boot, sent to darkest Africa by a London daily to cover a war that never quite happens. It's a fine opportunity for Waugh to skewer everyone in sight, and he does the job skillfully. Journalists, capitalists, communists, bureaucrats, and common folk--they're all grist for his mill. And the story moves along nicely, what with one mistaken identity and unforseen adventure after another. This must have been a good read and a shocking picture of how the world worked when it appeared in 1937. But we're now living in 1998. The shock value is gone, and the genre for which ""Scoop"" helped set the style has moved on. Read this book for mild amusement, but not for much else."
2,Scoop - A letdown,"I was eager to read Scoop, it has great adjectives attached to it: Intriguing, ebullient, witty, etc. I did not find it to be so.This book is in no way a classic. I realize that it was written in what? 1937, so the social mores have changed. The casual rascism was jarring to say the least, and it took me out of the book often. It was no Huckleberry Finn, where the character was doing the talking, it was text, straight from the author's head. It doesn't hold up well to modern eyes.There was one laugh out loud funny part, and it occured near the end. In no way did that joke make up for the pages gone before. Overall, I felt that it was a one joke book, from which perhaps Saturday Night Live could perform an unfunny skit."
2,Dated Satire,"Few would dispute that Waugh is a great writer with a memorable style. However, this book has a rather weak plot, and thin character development. The biggest disappointment is the much vaunted satire that comes across as dated and humorless. Read it quickly if you are interested in journalism. Otherwise, your time would better be spent watching an episode of the Gilmore Girls."
5,awesome,"Estoy muy feliz con eata CD.. me ponen a bailar.. I love this CD after many years without good latin music.. I love every song, I dance to the songs all the time.. thank you for a wonderful talent group.. I would be looking for more of this kind of music..ALSO AMAZON YOU DELIVER FAST THANKS BLANCA"
5,Language Has Everything To Do With It,"This is a magnificent English, Writing and Linguistics text. I have only just begun, and already there is a line of friends who want it ""next"". Language is fun, powerful. It defines who we are. This book goes into cartoons, historical detail and sometimes philosophical discussion about the very stuff of which our language is made. There is a serious look at sexist pronouns in the English language, as well as the usage of ""Latino"" vs. ""Hispanic"", and examinations of most of the languages that have come into common usage in English as spoken in the United States.There is plenty of room for an under-motivated student to enjoy the experience of learning about writing and language. It is well worth the $60 price tag, a price undoubtedly defined by the fact that it is a textbook. I bought it anyway, and it will remain a part of my permanent library. It just doesn't get any better than this!"
5,Deluxe Skip-Bo,My grandson and I play this game every week when he comes over. I already had a Skip-Bo from years back. We wanted an extra one to take on vacation to the beach every summer. This is a great family game!
1,not even for fans,"Shockingly bad sound--the amateur quality you would expect from a pirate taping, not from this (up till now) respected label."
4,"Interesting, dry","It has been a little over two years since I read Influence, the Psychology of Persuasion. From what I remember it was a very interesting read, though I found it to be quite dry from time to time. This definitely isn't bedtime reading material. The topics covered are all useful to anyone with an interest in the psychology of influence, and probably to anyone in the business/sales/marketing world. The examples and studies given in between the text are a joy to read. You'll probably find yourself discussing them with friends and acquaintances in between chapters. Even though the book can be dry at times I give it a high rating as a useful, insightful, and in depth look into, the topic of the book, they psychology of influence. Happy reading,-Zsen"
4,Okay,It's a good book worth reading worth the price but it does labor some points for a long time. ok
1,"Boring, Common Sense, written for Beginners","This book was really weak. It spent pages and pages making points that are common sense in everyday life. When I finished it, I was mad that I hadn't tossed it after being half way done.The author is a ""goody two-shoes"" college professor and the readers should be high school students. If you want to read descent books, pick up something by Robert Greene. His books at least take longer than 3 hours to read and keep you rereading them."
1,"Could be named ""how not to fall for marketing tricks""","If you summarize the book into one page, you will find in it useful, but basic, information about the psychology of consummer behaviour, and you will find some blank lines in it too."
2,Too much random running,"There were some useful tips displayed in the book, however most of examples given under each chapter are quite far from real daily situations and there is not close relation how the influence can be used in our work or private life, instead of that, there is 20-30 page random running about extraordinary and historical situations (for example world war, army camps etc).I was expecting to discover influence weapons that may be used in work and private, I did not receive it. Also The things discussed in book could be written much shorter to get the idea presented in it."
5,Awesome Book !!!,Great read and a must read book for everyone. Stays on my coffee table for ever. Every sales pitch looks funny for me now :)
2,"If you buy it, you have fallen victim of methods therein.","The big title ""Ph.D"" beside his name follows the Authority method (chapter 6). The quoted comments are blantant use of the Social Proof method (chapter 4). If you buy other books of Dr. Cialdini, you fall victim to the Commitment and Consistency principle (chapter 3). But indeed, this book says very little that has not been said in Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"""
4,Things you thought you knew...,"This is not the most well-written book I've ever read, but it's definitely one of the most thought-provoking. Some of the things Cialdini reveals seem like common sense to me, but the rest really surprise me -- not that I am a sociologist. Some of the techniques have also been very helpful in gaining compliance from my kids, who are only 2 and 4. We have an older edition of this book, and I like the layout of that one better -- easier to read. Asthetic aside, this book will raise your level of awareness, even if only a little bit."
2,Influence: The Psychology Of Persuasion,"Good information, but written in a style that fails tocut to the chase when the author give examples of basicconcepts."
3,An interesting insight into persuasion techniques,Quite a clinical report but well written. Mostly based on observations from studies conducted by students of psychology and therefore fairly reliant on statistical analysis.
5,Loved it.,"Definitely a classic. The six points are proven over and over. In fact the whole book is filled with ""I always wondered about that, and now I know why!"" stories. Sometimes verbose and a lot dated, still it is a book I will remember and go back to over and over as people try to influence me every day, and as I try, hopefully, to influence them!"
3,"Interesting topic, but too long-winded","The author has chosen some interesting phenoma, and he does a fine job at explaining them. However, it seems that the book could easily be reduced to half of its current length. The author goes on and on in redundant explanations about the topic, intermixing with anecdotes that I find to be unnecessary and not that believable."
5,The applications of this book are limitless,"We purchased this book with the intent of customizing a program administered by a non-profit, of which we are a part. Currently, more than 67% of offender who will be released this year will be back in prison within the next 30 months. Our mission is to keep people that have spent time in prison out for good and living a law-abiding lifestyle.As you might imagine, influencing ""hardened criminals"" can be dicey at times, which is why we felt adding the psychological tools and techniques this book teaches would bolster our efforts 10,000 fold over the price of a copy. So far, it has - and there is no indication that it might fail in the future.If you want to teach your children what they don't necessarily want to learn - if you want your impact in meetings to improve - if you aspire to political office - if you . . . Well, I think you get the idea.If you want to augment your influence in virtually any environment, then . . .BUY THIS BOOK"
4,An excellent book on behaviour,"I really enjoyed this book, it has some eye-opening concepts regarding human behavior that I wasn't fully aware of before. These concepts are good to know, not only from a marketing perspective but just as way of understanding our dealings with other people on a day to day basis. Overall it was very insightful, and I would surely recommend it to anyone who wants to know why we do things that we do."
5,As entertaining as it is educational,"I had so much fun reading this book. I would have been happy with the book if I had only learned about the psychology of influence. The substantial entertainment value was an added bonus. The author has a great sense of humor, particularly about himself, and all of the scientific studies that he cites as proof for his points will at least make you think, ""huh,"" if not say it out loud. I think my wife will be happy to hear that I am done with this book, because I think that I've worked a mention of it into every conversation we've had since I started reading it. And if all that weren't enough, the book's everyday usefulness is another compelling reason to read it. In a consumer driven culture such as ours, learning how to fend off the ""compliance practitioners"" should be a useful skill indeed. This book comes highly recommended."
4,An eye opening reading!,"Cialdini's book elucidates the insidious strategies of compliance that are used by consumerists, marketers, politicians, and compliance experts to manipulate the masses.His book is simple yet enlightening.It makes an interesting and edifying reading."
5,Extremely Interesting book,"I was assigned a book report to do for my psychology college course one day. After looking around for a interesting novel i happened to find this one. Then the general search brought me upon Robery Cialdinis book The psychology of persuasion.After recieveing the book, i begain to thus read it. Through out the whole novel, i was just noding my head, replaying in my mind instinces of such events happenening to me.I work in retail, and i use the same rules as described in the book, but just never knew why. now i know. It works people. Read this book and you will at least be aware of others actions.Protect yourself, and your wallet, it is the least you can do"
3,Influence book,"Haven't had a chance to read it yet, but received it quickly through the mail, so am very pleased with the seller."
2,I think you should read this,"I was very dissapointed by this average book.Persuasion is another marketing trick and actually a branch of SELLING. Instead of calling his book The Power of selling which immidiately puts the author in competition with others, he smartly decided to start Moutnain Dew, instead of Sprite.All this praise from Warren Buffett makes me think that Warren himself is a ripp off artist who is only interested in helping the author, who happens to be his friend.The book is actually not defined well, but the cover will persuede you to buy it.The author is nothing but a smart salesman, with average writing abilities.Do not look for business or dating tips here.I am sorry but public opinion is so easily manipulated in America.And you will buy this average book, because you do not know that it is actually selling tips, organized badly and backed by studies on animals.Sorry,a cowsalesman will give you a better review of persuasion tricks."
5,Gave as a Gift to Husband - He liked it.,"I bought this book for my husband as a birthday gift and he says that it is great reading and told me that I can read it only after he is finished. I didn't tell him that I actually wanted the book for myself, but I knew he would let me read it, and I had to buy him something for his birthday. I didn't know what to get him. So I killed two birds with one stone! Thank you Amazon!"
2,Too long for the amount of information,"The author could have spent only a few pages giving the same information. The content is interesting, but he repeats himself too much. Each method of persuasion can be detailed in one page without losing any significant information, but he managed to use an entire chapter for each.This is a book I recommend getting at the library or buying used."
3,Common sense info to most people,"Anyone who has dealt with salespeople will be familiar with the techniques described in this book. Nonetheless, it can be a good refresher to read before going out to make a major purchase, such as a car. The author tells a lot of ""real-life"" stories that demonstrate the techniques, but they tend to be a bit long-winded and slow to get to the point. Also, just my opinion, but I suspect that some of the stories didn't really happen, as they are just too tidy and neat to be true (that doesn't mean the principles they demonstrate are false)."
3,Useful,Useful insight into the world of influence. Captain Obvious appears a few times but generally a worthwhile read into the way humans work.
5,better than any marketing textbook.,"if you are involved in marketing or advertising, this is a must read. throw away all your marketing textbooks in college. this is the real thing. no theories but real studies. shows a ton of techniques in persuasion which you don't find in college textbooks."
5,A must read for marketing departments,"This book was recommended to me by a very well respected marketing professional. ""If you read one book, this is the one"".All I can say is, wow. It's powerful. A must read."
5,Excellent book for more uses than you'd think.,"I was actually suggested this book while attending a Hostage Negotiator conference and I don't regret it at all. I tend to be a non-fiction reader anyway (Malcolm Gladwell and his ilk) and this book was very interesting and fit the bill. Not only does it give fantastic suggestions for how to understand and help situations where these tactics come into play, but they also help you understand how others are doing the same to you. That aside, it was certainly a great read as far as usefulness in a crisis negotiation as well and helped me to understand the underlying psychological hooks that could help me help others out of their crisis. I can see many uses for this knowledge is day to day life and if you're a salesperson, negotiator, or just have a general interest in psychology it's well worth the read."
5,Incredible insights.,"Most of our actions are automatic. You can take advantage of this fact, by activating the psychological mechanism that triggers them. Use it wisely."
5,A Must Read For Sales People and Business Owners,"I recommend this book to all sales people and small business owners. An understanding of the psychology of why people do what they do is key to shaping your message, your product and your business."
5,Foundational,"Every aspect of human interaction traces back to the principles in this book. In any dealings with others in your everyday life, ehther profesisonal or personal you simply cannot afford to ignore the veracity of Cialdinis findings."
4,Great information,Want to learn how to be more persuasive? This is the book to do it. Cialdini does a great job of putting academic information out there for all to understand.
1,"Buy ""Influence-science and practice"" instead","Dont buy this book:""Influence- the psychology persuasion"". Buy ""Influence-science and practice"" instead as they are the same book !!It seems that the latter is more up-to-date.P."
4,Fun reading for the reluctant business book reader,"I am usually reluctant to read ""business"" books, but I am very pleasantly surprised by how well the information is presented and that it is a page-turner. At least one, and usually several, experiments are explained to provide foundation for the evidence, which satisfies the curiosity about this aspect of human behavior. I have begun looking at sales, advertisements and communications in general in new way!"
3,Interesting but is it actually informative?,"I'm glad I read this book. It provides a good look at how and why people are influenced in the decisions they make. On the other hand, I find myself thinking that I haven't really learned much I didn't already know. For instance, did you know that an individual is more likely to consent to a request from someone he likes than from someone he does not like? Well, yes, you probably did know that. Yet Cialdini spends an entire 40 page chapter telling you this."
4,Some Good Tips on Persuasion,"This is a good introductory book on NLP, because it provides some good tips on persuasion. For example, if you give someone a small gift (i.e. a cup of coffee) before you ask them to do something for you (i.e. buy some Girl Scout cookies), the chance that they will in fact do that favor for you increases drastically. And if you give absolutely any reason (i.e. I'm running late.) for cutting in line, most people will let you get in front of them.Katie"
3,Great of those who are new to this subject.,"Very interesting information if you have not taken any courses in psychology or economics in college. If you have, this book will be a repeat of most of what you have already learned. There are very detailed chapter long explanations that I feel might be overly expansive, or perhaps it is not written for audience like me. Practical use is definitely apparent as soon as you open the book. Albeit I feel that it could have been abridged to several paragraphs and still be equally effective.I recommend this book to those who are new to the subject of psychology."
5,"A great, insightful book","From a pure curiosity perspective, or if you are in sales, this book presents some very interesting aspects on influence.I read an interview with the author and was so intrigued that I had to buy the book. I was not disappointed. If you spend time thinking of these concepts, you will be better enlightened, whether it be for your personal knowledge or insight into sales concepts."
5,Least painful academic required reading,"I was required to purchase this book for a graduate class I'm taking. It was a really interesting and easy read. Cialdini uses his own experiences, research and submitted stories to communicate ways we agree to do things (whether we know it or not).I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in marketing, psychology or learning how to avoid being manipulated."
1,Only 1 use for each rod,i thought i could use them more than once. i was wrong. some fell apart while bending it to hold curl.
5,Easy Peasy,"The Amazon gift card comes directly to my email address, all I have to do is copy and paste the code when I am ready to check out my shopping cart. I have never had a single problem with it not working, or being the wrong amount.I have received numerous gift certificates and have yet to have that first problem with any of them."
2,Awful Gift Cards,"Amazon needs to make some major adjustments to their gift cards. First, the scratch-off material does not come off easily and is apt to smear, preventing one from even getting to the code. Second, if you succeed in getting to the code, it is in a miniscule font such that it is almost impossible to figure out the numbers/letters. Great idea; poor execution."
5,Great for e-books,"The card works perfectly for e-books. It's a win-win for me, and the gifter because we both know I got exactly what I wanted, no one had to go to a brick store, and the books are usually cheaper in e-form. YAY!!!"
1,Don't ever get one!,"You will loose you mind trying to redeem this piece of junk.Combinations after combinations of numbers and no result! Thanks for nothing Amazon, now since you got my money take it and buy yourself an Amazon gift card!"
1,Not satisfied,"My daughter purchased a Amazon gift card for me for 25$ which i tried to plug in several times to the system and it failed to work. I contacted Amazon thru there online chat system gave them all the numbers and was told to take the card back to the place that I had purchased it. Since it was a gift i cannot return the card which has the official Amazon logo on it, and was told they cannot help me. So in my opinion anyone buying these things are foolish."
3,Amazon Personal Wish List,"Editing gift card information - adding, deleting or changing individual gift cards - on the wish list would be useful. As I couldn't check the recipients or other selections of cards on the list after adding them, I had to delete the list and start all over to make sure what I wanted would be correct."
1,wish list,You don't give me the option to come back to purchase the item at a later date. I could not transfer my wish list to my cart no matter what I clicked on. It was very irritating!
3,Seattle Actually Has Style After All,"I've only heard a few tracks of this, but I did see them live last night at the EMP, I recommend! Their vocalist is a hotty and they are VERY solid sonically. I'm buying this CD now."
3,Ok for teachers to remind them about what passion is,"Thought it would be better, but nothing new inside this gem, still worth a read. Both books together certainly reminds teachers what PASSION is and should continue to be."
2,Not like seeing or reading it,I have seen and read the original star wars too many time to count. I bought these tapes when I was spending alot of time in my car. These tapes made that time go more slowly than if I only had an AM radio.
5,wonderful gift for new mom and baby,excellent products for baby! i try to give this newborn set to every new mom. not cheap but worth it!
1,Lob-sided view at the war that might of been.,"The book starts off with a 'very' fictional scenario, which depicts an army of USSR's elite tanks being destroyed by three Western MBT's. Totally discarding that T-80, has the most powerful gun fitted to any tank, and that it has the capability to fire an anti-tank missile at ranges well beyond those achieved by The Abrams or the Challenger. The whole book is structured to expose USSR's armoured weaknesses, some of which are quite fictional, while not even mentioning the setbacks the ""Western"" armies have. Steven Zaloga's reference to Russian people as ""Russkis"" is quite symbolic of the tone in which the entire book was written. Drawings by Simon McCouaig are of high quality, especially the detailed look at the Tanks from Top, Side and Rear viewpoints. Also note how the ""Russian observer"" looks, compared to all the other people drawn in the ""colour"" plates."
5,The Wild Girl: A Novel,"This book was a fabulous read and I recommend it highly. Would be a good book club read with interesting conversations. I read previously 1000 White Women also by Jim Fergus and wow, I love his books."
2,Not My Favorite,"I chose this book because I enjoyed ""1,000 White Women "" by Jim Fergus. It was GREAT! THis book was tough for me to stay with. It was also quite gruesome in places."
3,Enjoyable,The Wild Girl was an easy enjoyable read. The author's research in North American First Nation history was evident in this sometimes light fictional novel.
3,interesting,It is a good read but I wouldn't rave about it. It reminded me a lot of his book 1000 white women if I had not read that may have liked it better. It is slow to start but then gets better. I liked the cultural aspect and getting a glimpse of history however unsure the amount of truth behind it.
4,Great characters,Loved the story. I felt like I was there with them. The characters were unique and fun. I would like to rewrite the ending.
3,Entertaining Read but not a Great Book,"I had hopes of this being one of those great books that you will re-read for years to come but it didn't live up to expectations. The story was entertaining and the descriptive writing was very nice but my problem was the almost cartoonish charactors of the novel. The charactor of Tolley reminded me of someone from the show ""Will & Grace"" and was just completely unbelievable for the 1930's west. I really got tired of hearing about his lust for young boys. Sterotypical bad sheriff, independent woman proving her place in a man's world, down on his luck good guy hero, etc., etc. I did like how the story didn't romanticize the Native Americans as is the trend nowadays. It portrayed both sides of the coin, the injustices dealt the People but also their vicious brutalities. Good read if you can get past the over-played charactors."
2,disappointed,"I loved 1,000 White Women, so was thrilled to begin The Wild Girl. The first 1/3 of the book was a page turner---a wonderful scenerio---but then it fell apart. The character's language did not seem true to the era, especially the ""out of the closet"", flamboyant gay soldier. There were to many ""one in a million"" happenstances, and it was just plain confusing and disappointing as the story progressed."
5,I was sucked in,"I liked this book an awful lot. First off, Jim Fergus has also written hunting guides, so the areas of the book that relate to hunting or tracking or outdoor survival are very well written.The author was told a story about a ""wild girl"" and the end of her story was shrouded with suspicion so became the book.I thought it was well written, the author's writing style is highly entertaining and makes for a quick read, when I finished the book I read the Author's notes about circumstances that were artistically ""recreated"" for the book, and this led me on a very satisfactory journey of research, but even if you are not that ambitious, the book itself is a very good read."
3,Not as good as 1000 White Women,"For those that are considering buying this book because you LOVED Jim Fergus' other book 1000 White Women, be prepared for a let-down. This is not his better work. The characters are easily forgetable, the dialog is too contemporary for the 1800's. The book was OK, but is one that I will not be passing on to others as a MUST READ. Suggestion: buy it used if you can."
5,My deadlines simply had to wait. . .,"while I read on to see just what happened next in this page-turner.I LIKED the fairly contemporary language - this is the 1930s Fergus portrays, NOT the turn of the last century, or even earlier. The 1930s ARE contemporary, if by ""contemporary"" we understand that the people who were young then, though old now, are still many of them living and often lively!I LIKED reading Fergus' portrayals of what some readers refer to as ""stock characters"" - if the world weren't full of them, no writers would have made them ""stock"".I LIKED the ""side story"" narrative, it tied up loose ends and framed the main plot quite nicely.This was a perfect summer vacation/road trip read."
4,Good Introductory Book,"This was the book that I learned Complex Analysis from. Definitely made the subject accessible to pretty much any reader. Plenty of exercises: some more theoretical, some more applied. It skillfully straddles the gap between being a theoretical math book and a math book for people with more applied aims (such as engineers). Most topics are covered thoroughly, though certain more complicated subjects such as winding number are left out for simplicity.This book definitely prepared me for tackling the dense, theoretical, and exceptional ""Complex Analysis"" by Ahlfors. I'd recommend it as an introductory book for anyone trying to get into the subject who is intimidated by Ahlfors, as well as for anyone who is only interested in the essential commonly-applied tools."
2,I don't like it...,The MP3 version I bought has some gapes in the music where it stops completely then continues...If I could get my money back or a credit that would be greatly appreciated...If not I will seriously re-think buying music from Amazon anymore...John Lepore
5,A Must Have Album. Every Track is Golden.,"When released somehow learned of it and it absolutely amazing, golden. If you do not have this, you must. Words and music and each track, tune, tied to the next. Haunting, magical. A+++++"
1,buy real gear wrench!,I'm 27 years old and worked as a mechanic for the passed 7 years . i will never buy anything but craftsman ( best warranty ever) or gear wrench. Don't be fooled this product is not gear wrenchThis product is OK for small jobs will not bring it out for my regular jobs maybe i can give it to my 5 year old little girl as a starter tool set. its also made in Taiwan
4,At last...,"I'm happy I found this movie. I was a teenager when I saw it on the french television and the only thing I remembered was the chopper chase.And the end of course. I was looking for it for so many years and I'm so glad I got it.I love this main character played by David Janssen. I recommend it. If you loved it you should also like ""Vanishing point"" released 36 years ago exactly.Enjoy !!!"
4,Neat Flick...!,"Too bad this is no longer available here. It was great when I saw it on TV back in the 70's. Others here are commenting on the music, and I agree...it hurt to change the soundtrack on the re-release. The character Harry (David Janssen) was one of the flying tigers. I have it recorded on VHS, and enjoy it every so often. Watching two hovering choppers dueling it out in an old aircraft hangar was totally wild! See it if you can!"
2,Three Little Fishies where are you?,"One of the integral pieces of this film is the 1940's music soundtrack. For example, Harry Walker's (Jansen) favorite song is ""Three Little Fishies"". At one point in the chase, he can be seen singing along with the record. In this travesty of a DVD, he's singing along to some xylophone solo. Until somebody ""fixes"" the DVD, I'll have to stick with my home recording that KABC hacked up to fit in the commercials."
3,What did they do to the original?,"One of the most interesting aspects of the original was that the WWII veteran used a lot of swing band jazz titles as dialogue, which wasn't as corny as it sounds when coupled with the flying action and the matching WWII era song soundtrack. Why would they undo that?"
4,Critique from a Helicopter Pilot and 40's music aficionado,"My only disappointment with the this DVD is that the original soundtrack music has been altered (I will assume for licensing purposes). This results in two anomalies: the soundtrack is out of sync in some portions of the film and the first-time viewer of this film may wonder why the main character is waving his hands in 2 of the film sequences. The flight sequences (stunt flying) will be appreciated by any helicopter pilot; however, I miss the original music. If I could buy an un-altered copy I would gladly do so."
4,How sad - they lost the music,I was looking forward for so long to seeing this terrific movie again. I saw it when originally presented in '73 and loved it.When the saw that the disc was out I was all over it. Imagine my dismay when I found that they deleted the original soundtrack. It ruined the movie for me. Sure the action sequences are good - and Jansen is at his best - but without the original music it's nothing.Avoid this version until they correct the travesty. How much could Three Little Fishies cost anyway?
5,"Tender, Loving, and Heartfelt","This book was sooooooo good! Parker and Alex were a couple that i loved, they were apart for a period of ten years before they were able to finally embrace their love for one another and come together. They meet again at mutuals friends wedding at first Parker doesn't recognize Alexander, but she recognizes him. They are thrown together by their friends at the reception, where they pick up where they left off. At first Alex is reluctant, because she feels Parker left and abandoned her but soon she gives in after Parker encourages and pushes her to embrace her dreams of becoming a professional singer in the opera. Parker himself has become famous for his music, and isn't all into it as he use to be, but he wants Alex to realize, and embrace her dream, because she encouraged him to embrace his. When, Alex gets sick, Parker is finally able to prove and show her how much he loves her."
5,"cool hip,good dancing music,love b i g",this song is cool hip and it's got lots of style.i like this song alot.it makes me wanta dance and get down all dirty.b i g is the bomb and he made awesome music we all miss him.live on biggie.
5,One of her best,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! One of the gentlest, most tender romances I've ever read. You'll care about Louisa and J.W. and their journey from the first words, their first thoughts, their first steps. I couldn't put it down."
3,A Decent Spanish Text,"This book was used for my college Spanish course. It's a good course. It uses plenty of illustration and excercises to help you learn Spanish. However, as a college course book, I think it's weak. It's probably great for high school, but I found the book to be relatively easy and leisurely. If that's what you want, then this book is for you."
5,Manna from Heaven,"This recording is a must-have for Baby Lemonade, Wondermint, and Jellyfish fans. Deeper than the previous 2 Baby Lemonade discs, High-Life is a gorgeous thing of beauty that simply stuns. Trueaudio heaven..."
2,Not up to par...,"For $26 (that includes taxes and shipping) this is a pretty decent pair of camo capris for anyone whos looking for something to wear on lazy days lounging around the house and doing chores, or maybe even for a Halloween costume. However, the material is much too thin and delicate for long-term wear. Also, I followed the size chart according to my measurements and ordered a size 7/8 - it was more like a size 4. So if you're planning on ordering these make sure to order two sizes up from what you would normally wear. The size chart is totally off. I'm returning these and spending an extra $20 for a more comfortable and durable pair of camo shorts elsewhere. The shipping was pretty fast and the customer service was great, but these just weren't what I was looking for."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I received these capri's as a gift and even though they were the correct size they were about 3 sizes to small. I have been trying to exchange them for the past two weeks and have had no response from my emails. Whatever you do, don't do business with this company. They are very unprofessional and thier website is impossible to navigate. They also have no listed phone number."
2,Sizing is horrible,"Product run very very small. I would not recommend ordering this product if you wear a size 12 or up if you do please be aware it will not go pass your thigh. I was very disappoointed, didn't bother sending it back because of shipping cost. I found someone to give it to as a gift."
1,Terrible measurements,I ordered these pants for an upcoming event. I ordered a size up and they just didn't fit all of my booty. I'm either going to return them or sale them to a friend at my event.
5,Very good,"Thrashy folk metal with pipe and fiddles. Very good. I tend to like thrash, speed metal and power metal and I really enjoy this even though its different than other groups I've heard. The only other fold metal I,ve bought is Skyclad but this sounds heavier to me, but I still like the Skyclad I've heard too."
4,More metal this time,"I prefer Spirit of the Forest to this album. On Spirit the melodies stand out more, where I feel on this album rhythms are dominant and the songs are less distinctive. So if you are more into fast rhythms than strong melodies then you will prefer this album. The folk influence mainly comes from the fiddle, with pipes and accordeon also on some songs. Native Land is my favorite song on the album, it is a fitting anthem for a tiny country that held off the Soviets far longer than expected during WWII. I give the songs on this album 3 stars, and 5 stars to the band for being cool enough to combine folk and metal."
3,NOT THEIR BEST,"I'm a very picky person, unlike some who hand out 5 stars as if they were candy. With that being said, I enjoyed Korpiklaani's latest album ""Tales Along this Road"" much better than this one, ""Voice of Wilderness"". I'll explain why.""Voice of Wilderness"" starts off strong with the catchy ""Cottages and Saunas"" (and I can't help but smile when I hear them try to pronounce ""saunas""). But sadly, the next great song, ""Spirit of the Forest"", doesn't appear until several tracks later. ""Beer Beer"" almost found its way into my picky music library, but for one problem: ""Happy Little Boozer"" from their latest album is much better.The rest of the songs do their job of creating that fireside folksy ambience, but that's about all. I didn't find them all that catchy.If you like folk metal I also recommend the Estonian folk metal bands Raud-Ants (female fronted) and Metsatoell (male fronted)."
4,just one flaw,"i will not lie, this cd is friggin awesome. it really is, but the is only one flaw in this cd, every song is in the same key. my favorite song on this cd, Hunting Song, starts off on the same key, but in minor, but then it goes back to the same key used in the rest of the cd. i give this cd 4 stars, because of the same reason. hopefully on their next cd they'l be a little more flexible on that."
5,A Real Knee-Slapper,"I picked up Larry's CD last week and loved it. His pop culture-based comedy is better than any of the ""established"" comedians I've heard lately and gives the other young Turks a real run for the money. It's like the Grammys, Miami Vice, MTV, an After School Special and TV Land all rolled into one -- gotta love it. Plus, the CD combines a bunch of different musical styles into a true ""compilation"" album (rap, rock, country, blues, punk, plus some). Good stuff -- for my money, you can't beat ""Grandpas Gone Gangsta,"" ""500% More Crab"" and ""Country Folks Can Survive."""
2,simply inadequate,The signs are introduced too quickly and no opportunities for repetition or practice are offered. The producers of this video should have consulted someone competent in pedagogy.
1,How bad can it get?,I am glad you ask me to review the video. It was terrible and waste of money. I already understand a lot of sign and could not understand how the two people on this video could be teaching anyone anything.
3,Good tool but a little bit difficult for a novice,"The DVD is well done, but or they will repeat 2/3 time the same word which is good, or sometime they will go to fast which is frustrating because you do not have the time to see the hand mouvment nad so learn the word.I wish the CD would have more explaination about how to bild a full sentence and no just focus on words.Sould be a great tool for an advanced begginer"
1,Awful,Not the true artists. Didn't notice and bought the thing. Don't make the same mistake I did. Lori Burress u
3,Engaging View of China Before the Revolution,"While there are obviously dated aspects of this book (it was written around 1944) it gives an engaging view of the Chinese countryside under Communist domination, and is an especially compelling picture of the guerilla warfare against the invading Japanese armies at that time."
1,They feel like butter...for about an hour,"I live in Phoenix, Arizona and my feet take a beating year around. I have horribly dry feet and my right heel has a habitual crack that I cannot get rid of. I thought I would give these booties (plus the recommended tea tree oil lotion; sold separately) a try for a deep moisturizing. I wore them for several hours the first night, and it actually seemed to help, for about an hour. Then almost magically after an hour, my dry feet returned to their normal state. I attempted to wear them overnight, but they annoyed me so much that I couldn't sleep. The gel-like insides cling to your feet. It almost feels like you have wet socks on. They are one size fits all, so they are a little big for my size 7 foot. Therefore, when walking in them, the booties slide around a little. Overall, I would not purchase again. Especially, for the $20 price tag, and that is just for the booties."
4,Mom loved these,I bought these for my mom (late 50s) and she LOVED them. She said they're so comfortable and nice. I plan on purchasing more for Christmas gifts.
3,"Mercy, Mercy","This is my first book by Krueger and I don't feel I need to go back and pick up on the past history of Cork and Jo as this one pretty much spelled it out for you. I don't like endings like this either that MAKE you read the next one.Try John Lescroart's mystery, sleuth, court room dramas he sticks with the main 2 characters and their adventures but each one ends and is nicely tied up.But I would surely start at the beginning of these adventures to learn of the 2 main guys histories. These books will leave you satisfied."
2,mercy falls,"the book was okay, not great. the plot keeps you interested all the way through the book and the charecters are interesting, but there is no ending to the book. I don't know about anyone else but I don't like being held hostage to another book just to see how this one ends."
3,Disappointing....,"I love Krueger and his Cork O'Connor series. Now Cork is finally the Sheriff again in Aurora, MN. All of the books in the series have lead you to this point, and all the books have been grounded in the area and the interaction between the town and the Ojibwe Indians. While the story here is interesting it doesn't read like the rest of the series - and the ending is a gimmick. I wouldn't miss this series but this isn't Krueger's best work - an obvious lead in to the next book. Prior to this the books haven't needed a hook to get me to read the next one - I hope this doesn't become his pattern."
1,Mercy Falls,"I have always greatly enjoyed Krueger's books, and have highly recommended him in the past. I enjoyed this book, until the ending. It was so disappointing that I have dropped my rating of Kruger to poor. I now find it embarrassing that I have recommended his so highly in the past. I will not buy his next book and recommend others avoid him. Cliff hangers are fine in weekly serials, and unexpected plot twists designed to draw one into the next book are fine, if well done. But to simply cut off a book in mid-chase is inexcusable. I do not know if the author simply got tired, did not know how to end the book or if the publisher decided that the book had to go to press immediately even without an ending. But I was most disappointed."
2,"Sounded promising, but ultimately Disappointing","I have been going to the Boundary Waters to canoe since I was a kid, and I love the descriptions of this wonderful, beautiul area. I really like the Cork OConnor series - but I agree with others that the ending in this one sucked. Didnt adequately tie up loose ends about the murder, plus Cork is on the run with a bounty on his head, leaving you to wonder whats doing on, and trying to force you to buy the next book. Also why shd Cork trust the Dina character, who worked for the villain'sfamily? some of these things just dont make sense.Read the others, but skip this one."
3,Mercy Falls,WKKrueger is always enjoyable and this was within the realm of acceptance. I'm left with the desire to read the next Cork O'connor story and know it will meet my expectations. His books are simply good stories.
4,Krueger is one of the few that can get away with this ending.,"I love Kreuger's writing. He creates characters about whom you care, a plot that carries you without fault from beginning to end, a sense of place you can see and dialogue you can hear. He even get away with an ending that, from a lesser author, would be a wallbanger for me, but I know I'll read Krueger's next book anyway, so I forgive him but it did cause me to drop from an Excellent to a Very Good rating. If you've not read Krueger, do, but I would start at the beginning."
4,"Definitely a solid effort, but not the best of the series","Mercy Falls Kruegers latest effort in the Cork O Connor series is a solid one. I liked the story that was told because there were a lot of plot twists involved in the story. What I didn't like is if you really concentrated your efforts on the backdrop and elements of the story some of what happens is predictable. But I will say that Mercy Falls is better than 90% of the other novels written out there. Definitely a must read for Cork O Connor fans, if you haven't had a chance to read anything by William Krueger start with Iron Lake and work your way from there. In my opinion Krueger's novels are a great option when your through Reading Michael Connellys, George Pelecanos, or Ken Bruens novels and your looking for solidly written material."
4,Mercy Falls Review,"An excellent book and a fast read. This book should appeal to everone, not just MN readers."
4,Great read,"The plot keeps you turning the pages. Being from Minnesota myself, it's interesting to read of familiar places and enjoyable to read about native spirituality."
5,Nothing beats this sprouter,"I have used just about every type of sprouter over the years, but the sprout master is the one for me. It makes perfect sprouts every time. Drainage and air circulation is excellent. The level of difficulty is: EASY. They work well when stacked. I like my sprouts growing vertically I have learned. I prefer greening them up before eating, so this makes the perfect design. Plus the sprouts look absolutely gorgeous in the sproutmaster, unlike Easy Sprout, or jar sprouting where they are all bunched together. Make sure you sterilize the tray with vinegar and water soaks before sprouting new sprouts. If you do that, you should have no problems with mold."
5,Sprout Master Triple Hit,"I love the trays! My alfalfa sprouts are green and bountiful. Best of all they don't smell! This trays are worth every penny. Don't try mason jars, your sprouts are just going to get ruined.If you think it's to expensive, try the mini trays. But I know you'll just want to get the larger ones latter :)"
2,"Sounds so, so....",If you wanna hear some real tight beats check out:Rap Beats Hip Hop Beats All Instrumental Music Volume 2
4,High Quality Product,The product is high quality and delivers excellent listening pleasure in my own privacy without disturbing other family members. The headphones are used with TV. I am very pleased with the headphones and the timely mail delivery which was much sooner than expected!
5,Much better than Sony,Finally a good set of wireless headphones that are not limited to line of sight (infrared). I was leery of these since I was not familiar with this brand. How wrong I was. They are great and they have excellent reception.I can even wear them while walking into different rooms and still hear very clearly.
5,Great headphones for the price!,"These things work great, tv sounds awesome. I paid $39 dollars for these, so for the amount I paid, I think these are well worth it. They work on the 900 mhz frequency, not infrared, so I can walk around my apt freely, without worrying about line of sight. I get no static at all, unless I move a little too far out of range.The only drawback is that this model does not have a rechargeable battery pack, so you either have to buy a seperate battery/charger set, or continuously buy batteries. Using a pair of batteries every night for a few hours lasted me about 2 weeks, so if you use this often, rechargeables are the way to go."
4,Nice headphones,Well I paid only nineteen . ninety nine for these headphones (minus shipping)... so nothing much to complain about. I use these mainly for my TV. It's amazing... and perfect for it. I use re-chargeable batteries and I still have to recharge them. Never tried listening to music on it... so cannot give any feedback on it.
4,headphones,I ordered these for my wife because she is always asking me to turn up the volume on the television. They work great and now she can control her own personal sound volume. Hooray!
2,"playable for kids, a poor rip off for adults","I should know better than to buy games that are movie tie-ins but this one looked like it was fun.Whats good?...well..you can be Jack Sparrow and the graphics are pretty decent.Whats bad? Camera angles are quirky, the game is too dark and you need to play in a very dark room to see, there are no items to look for, you just go from level to level hacking and slashing.no matter how good the movie is, this is my last tie in game."
4,PUBLIC WORKS INSPECTORS MANUAL,THIS IS A WONDERFUL REFERANCE BOOK WITH A WEALTH OF MATERIAL. IF YOU DO ANY INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THIS IS A MUST
4,Just a few minor flaws,"Outstanding leather and workmanship. Sturdy, strong, well thought out and comfortable to carry. My only criticism is that the front two pockets and the back pocket close only with magnetic snaps. WEAK magnetic snaps. They pop open so easily I am not comfortable carrying anything in them. The cell phone pocket should be velcro and the other two zippered. Minor flaws but annoying nonetheless, especially for a bag this price. Other than that I love it. A little leather conditioner now and then and this bag should be able to take a beating for years."
5,Quality Leather Bag,"I bought the black one, this is my second purchase of this exact bag.My first purchase in 2007 was in saddle/tan.Some of the differences are magnets are used instead ofvelcro, and the strap hardware is a little more robust.Review for the new Black Bag:Good quality leather - hardware made well -construction is very good.Size is generous for a smaller bag. Magazines, Ipad, file folders all fit.The feel of the leather feels like real leather, not like some other bags made inChina. Also, one reviewer mentioned the magnetic flaps don't stay put, mine work fine.I would definitely recommend this bag."
4,Anglo-style folk with punch...,"It's a tantalizing mystery to figure out how Radioactive Records chooses its material. This one is a little more ""accessible"" than some of their offerings. First, it is in a musical style readily recognizable, Anglo-folk-rock in the general vein of the Strawbs and perhaps Lindisfarne and countless others. The band spends much of their time letting the ""rock"" element influence, as in the jaunty opening track ""Days of Sunshine"" and the absolute killer version of Dylan's ""Tom Thumb Blues."" The blasting Hammond and stylish guitar noodles on the latter just blew me away. I couldn't help but think that maybe I could appreciate the whole CD better if those two songs weren't so great. Try programming these to the end and see how that works for you. A fine effort, overall."
3,Paris in Detail,"I recently bought Paris in Detail.Paris in Detail is literally that, lots of detailled close up photos of Paris doorways, arches, detailled doorframes, and intricate wrought iron stairways. Although there is a few photos of detailled sculptures in it, the majority of the book focusses on doors, metal doorknockers, fireplaces, doorways and stairwells of old style Paris. The pages in the book are all black and white photos mostly covering the whole of each page. Many of the photos are of late 1890's in Paris.Reviewed By Liz Kelly"
2,Quality could be better,"For something with the Harley Davidson name on it, and how much it cost, I expected better quality.Not a bad tie, but worth no more than about $10."
5,How awesome!!,The story of Pearl was as charming as the rest of the Jewel series! Pearl and Cal seem an unlikely pair but when they get together fireworks start!! The whole series was awesome!! Read it if you haven't. You won't regret it!!
3,Skip the fiction please ....,"Add another star or two depending on how much you enjoy historical fiction. I wish the author had not been so creative because I think his fictional re-creation detracts from an otherwise invaluable account of his discovery of one of main sites of the legendary battle of the Tuetoburg Forest. A very detailed proposed reconstruction of the battle is thoroughly supported and explained though this is hampered by inadequate maps. I am determined to find adequate topographical maps on my own because the author is a man who has walked and explored this terrain and shares his insights about how and where the fights in and around the Teutoburg Forest might have developed. Something that is often glossed over by others. Recommended, but you will have to work at getting the most out of this book."
4,Disagree that the battle changed world history,"I agree with Peter Heather that if Rome had really wanted to conquer Germania, it would have and the defeat of three legions would not have stopped them. However, a cold, forest-covered land inhabited by wild fur-clad warriors held little attraction. The return for the effort would have been insufficient. The decision to forgo conquest was a rational one and similar to the similar decision not to fully pacify and colonise Scotland after the Battle of Mons Graupius."
2,"skip this, buy the other two","Some of my objections are similar to those already noted, especially the lack of maps and the annoying fiction. I bought the three major books on the Varusschlacht (Murdoch and Wells in addition to this one), and Clunn is the most irritating. He's a mediocre writer at best, and the book has too much redundancy, contradiction, and error. The narrative, with its imagined dialogue, is incredibly annoying. If you consider just the archaeological story, the book is okay. But even that is too drawn out, and the discovery of the most sensational artifact - the face mask - is completely glossed over. He doesn't even credit the person who found it. I recommend the other two books in combination. Wells does the best job of providing a historical background, and provides a sufficient number of maps. Murdoch's book is best read after Wells. Clunn's book is a major disappointment."
1,I Don't Get It,The ending was a monumental let down. Did I miss something that the other reviewers understood? Nothing is done to apprehend the thief...it's all left up in the air. I didn't like the book from the beginning but plodded on to the end. What a mistake. Don't wast your time.
4,"Good entertainment (no more, no less)","I had been a long time away from reading fantasy when I picked this one. It brought me back into fantasy stuff. The books strong points are it's agile storytelling and it's bizarre concepts. The author isn't excessively wordy, doesn't describe the settings and actions neither more nor less than he should. Concise writing. Good. He is also a little on the twisted side, as far as his villains are concerned. The evil on them is not comic book evil, or James Bond films evil - which are ""light"" villains. Silke's bad guys are ""heavy""; really insane and mean. They don't need to boast to be cruel. There's a lot of sexuality in the book, which, added to the violence, would make me label it dark fantasy. And good one at that. For fans of the genre (who aren't disturbed by strong violence), I recommend it."
3,Worth a read. . .,"This book has many positive points. I would encourage any TKD practitioner to read it. However, it is ponderous at points, I think due to Mr. Cook's attempt to convey the great inner meaning TKD has for him. It tends to be too personal and anecdotal, reading like a diary of his last trip to Korea. The author tends toward strings of polysyllabic words, however, that conceal as much as they reveal. A good editing to strip away the fluff would have made for a more accessible work. Like another reviewer, I found the author's enthusiasm for other spiritual/philosophical viewpoints a bit grating at times. Is it possible to NOT embrace Buddhism, and yet be a martial artist? If the martial arts encompass universal values, that should be true.Not to fault the author, though. He is clearly well-informed and writes with passion and enthusiasm. For that reason I would recommend it especially to adult readers who want to take their practice of TKD beyond a repertoire of physical techniques."
2,The hunting party,It was not as good as I thought it would be. I've seen Gene Hackman in better movies.
2,Languid Metaphorical Western,"Copious metaphorical rhetoric is abundant in this dubious Western staring Oliver Reed, Candice Bergen and Gene Hackman. Director Don Medford is out of his element trying to pull off a logical yet meaningful story out of this monstrosity of events and filmed images. Themes of violence, love, obsessive hate, sadism and more run throughout this film but there is no logical conclusion to what has transpired. Oliver Reed's performance is ludicrous. The stalwart L. Q. Jones gives the only good performance in this film!"
3,Kidnapping with a twist,"A good western which starts with a slap of rejection, twists to the kidnapping and then the hunting trip begins. As for the twist, well watch the movie!!"
5,Nice and warm for my little one,"The shirt is as described. If you are ordering this for your child who is at the middle or end of the size, order the next size up. It might be a little snug for a size 6. I think the extra small is 4-6. however it is soft, warm, comfy, cozy and looks great on my little guy."
4,Youth Crewneck Sweatshirt,Item was received in a timely manner. We are completely satisfied with the sweatshirt. My granddaughter enjoys wearing it and it did not fade or color the water when it was washed.
5,hanging flame lamp,the perfect finishing touch to my halloween decor. just what i wanted and the price is one of the lowest i found.
5,Great Deal,"Got a great deal on goldbox, I think the movies look great, others have commented on lack of special features but personally I never watch them, just want to enjoy the movie."
5,Great Buy,"J.K. Rowlings Book and movie series has always boomed with the masses. It's notable as to why this is true; From amazing special effects even in the first year, to the dramatic and dangerous storyline that has followed all the way to the present year, it's no wonder as to why younger and older viewers alike flow into the movie theaters each time the next year is released. Although J.K. Rowling is ending her series in the next few years, I believe that her greatest writings will be remembered long after. Harry Potter is one of the best movies I have seen in my life, and it is worth watching now if you have managed to dodge peer pressure and curiousity all these years. I believe that if someone else plans on making a movie about the mythical and magical, they will need to pour in more money than ever and use all the highest rated equipment imaginable, to have a chance against Harry Potter."
5,So great!,"I am a college student and, as such, spend a lot of time watching my favorite movies, but have very little room (or money) to have too many films. This box set is definitely affordable and fits perfectly on my bookshelf. The only problem I have is the lack of special features, but I can deal with that in exchange for the great product."
4,Excelente,"Maravillosos los Blu-Rays. Perfectas las opciones de cambio de idioma. Lamentablemente cuando hicieron el lanzamiento eran como a la mitad del precio en que los compre. No pude adquirilos en ese momento porque queria hacer una sola gran compra con otros articulos y fue subiendo de precio poco a poco. Entonces, era mejor opcion antes"
2,very Low Volume - Nice picture,"I like the series set.When playing the blu-ray disc, I have to turn my audio up twice as loud as other Blu-Ray disc that I ownjust to hear what the actors are saying.This maybe due to the duplication process used to create these Blu-Ray disc.The order arrived on time as promised.I would not recommend this set, unless you do not mind low volume when they are speaking."
4,this is the UK version,"i was so excited when i saw the price for this set! when it came in the mail, the first movie was titled the philosopher's stone and not the sorcerer's stone as previously stated in the product discription. other than that everything seems to be fine"
5,Nicely packaged set,The individual DVD's are in a thinner case than the normal DVD's you would purchase separately which is nice for storage. We already had all but the first movie and purchased this set for the cabin. My son loves the 'collection'.
5,"Dont buy all the Potter films on Blu Ray separately, just get this boxed set/",I got this for $39.99 here and that was a steal! Not the mention all the Blu Rays are loaded with bonus material and a picture to die for. The best way to watch anything is blu ray!
3,Audio disappointing,"I choose this boxed set of all available Potter films as my first Blu Ray purchase. The first thing I noticed was the audio. It sounded a lot like the DVD's, probably because it is. You ARE NOT getting either Dolby True-HD or DTS Master Audio on these editions except for Half-Blood Prince. Odd, considering the new lossless formats are available on each individual film sold seperately.If you have the equipment & are a fan of the new audio formats offered on Blu Ray, skip this particular edition & buy the films separately."
3,disappointment,"Alright there are no bonus features on this set which really disappoints me, this set is just for people who are interested in the movies not die-hard fans"
1,I thought this was a great deal...,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas. I thought this was perfect since she didn't have any of the movies yet & for the price ($42.00 at the time) it seemed the best way to go. These were new dvds, right out of the package. We all settled in to watch the newest of the six. It skipped, scrambled & then just froze. We tried cleaning it, tried using a different dvd player, nothing has worked. We're going to check the others, but I wanted to write this now to save someone else the same frustration."
1,Harry Potter Stinks,I have watched a few of the Harry Potter movies and I just don't understand why people like it. I really dislike it.
5,good buy,A great addition to any collection. My family enjoyed watching the movies in blu ray and are very happy to own our set.
4,Harry Potter is amazing!,"So, first of all, I love Harry Potter! These are some really great movies and I highly recommend them. They are at a really great price considering what I was finding on Ebay and [...]. The only thing I didn't really like about them is they have no special features, but if all you are wanting is the movie (which they're great even without the special features) then this is a great choice!"
2,Great set--if it weren't edited,"*Note this is for the DVD edition of the HP1-6 Set.It would have been nice to know that the movies are edited and are missing scenes. It is very disconcerting to watch a movie for the umpteenth time and realise a scene is missing. Really, it rather ruins the movie experience.For shame not warning buyers of this kind of tomfoolery."
3,What is up with amazon.com?,"The movies are great, but what is up with amazon.com and this item? The price has gone from $60 to a holiday special of $40 and is now $100. If you are thinking of buying this (at $100), you may want to wait until the prices goes back down."
4,The wish of the power of our mind in transforming space and time to our belonging,"This is as simple as to say: the story written is fictional yet the basic aspects are to be seen on the New Earth: time warp and travel, manifesting and more. So far, only the ones who have chosen to say with the wish I AM ALWAYS ON THE PATH OF LOVE have started to create their own positive way of life. This is the enhancement of the imprints in our world - to see and to wish to have ""back"" what we are here to learn: our ways of learning to manifest the given Einstein's E=MC2 - everything is energy.We use it the way we dedicate ourselves and the way we are shown the dark and light in the movie is the way we can enhance our own life. See what you wish to see and focus upon it - and wish to be in the best feeling place - while declaring I AM ALWAYS ON THE PATH OF LOVE.The Master."
2,Insufficient Information Prior to Purchase,"The title of this review says it all. I had viewed only 2 of the 6 DVDs in this set when I discovered that they are not complete movies. For whatever reason they have been edited and some of the original material has been removed. If I had known this prior to my purchase I would NOT have purchased it. Now it appears that I will have to purchase each movie individually if I want to watch the complete movie. Even then, I suppose, I will not know what I'm receiving until I view each one. Caveat Emptor."
5,Worth every penny,"What can you say about a set of great movies which are then improved even more by putting them on Blu-ray and packaging all six together? If you purchase the six individual Blu-ray movies, they currently run $105.94 as opposed to the $92.99 for this set. So you not only get top-quality movies, but you save $13.00 in the process. The picture quality and sound quality are superb. As I said, there isn't much more to say about movies that have been reviewed hundreds of times. As for an erroneous opinion that you are getting ripped off by this set, all I can say is do the math. The 5-pack Blu-ray version sells here for $80.99, not $54.99 (that was the DVD 5-pack which is now down to $49.99), so the difference between the 5-pack and the 6-pack is only is only $12.00. The Half Blood Prince sells individually for $19.49, so, you save $7.49 off the price of the sixth movie by buying this set."
3,Nicely Done!,"Aside from having to buy this series a second time, I have to say that this is a worthwhile purchase. It is crisp and clean, as you would expect blu-ray to be. I have to say it is not a HUGE difference in the overall film experience, but it IS a definite improvement. I think the small details are clearer and the color is more vivid, however after the first film the series gets considerably 'darker' as it goes; both figuratively and literally, so how much that matters is up to the individual.On the whole, I recommend it."
5,Bargin price = great time with kids,My kids and I came late to the potter books and movie but we are glad we got into them. the box set was on sale for $40.00 before Chrismas so we jumped at the chance to buy and don't regreat it at all. just to rent all 6 would have cost upwards of $20-25. this is almost like stealing...a 9yr old and a 4yr old really don't care about blu-ray vs dvd. they are happy to have all 6 movies and the looks on their faces Christmas morning was well worth it. amazon shipping took a little long but i guess they sold a ton of these box sets so it's all good.
3,must of been from overseas.,"the first movie was title HP and the philosophers stone instead of the sorcerers stone. which kinda weirds me out. the movies come in two packs. the first two years in one case, the next two in the next and so on. they all look really good. the first two movies a little grainier than the others, but still better than regular dvd. on the sixth movie the volume level on the dvd just wasn't as loud as the others and i dont know why. but overall the movies do look really well and the price wasn't to bad either."
3,Decent set but could have been better.,"I am a big fan of Harry Potter so I was very excited to buy this set for Christmas. However, overall this set could have been a lot better. First of all, it is lacking in special features. Not that it doesn't have any, it does, but it certainly doesn't have a lot. I was especially disappointed at the lack of deleted scenes, which I often consider to be one of the best special features a movie can have. Second, one of the movies glitched when I tried to watch it. I was able to make it work by fast forwarding and then rewinding but it was rather annoying. So, while this set was a nice way to get all the movies together (minus the final one of course) it was lacking in quality."
2,"Great Video, poor Audio","Thus far we've watched 4 of the 6 Video's. The graphics on our 55"" Visio Screen are truly magnificant. However, the Audio leaves a great deal to be desired. The Music background blows you out of your chair, while the Audio Dialogue between characters leaves us straining to figure what was said. Maybe it's our two 15 watt built in TV Speakers? We're in the process of adding an A/V Sony 500 watt receiver, hopefully complimenting our Sony Blu Ray Player and therein improving the Sound output. Till then, I'd be curious to read/review others thoughts on the Audio portion of these Video's."
1,get out of here...,Why would anyone spend $1000 on this when it doesn't include the movies?! You can buy the same Hogwarts castle and the complete 8 disc blu ray collection brand new for half that price!
1,Missing a disc!,For some strange reason the box set was missing a disc in the prisoner of azkaban. Checked it right after removing the wrapping and the disc wasnt there!
2,Bare Minimum Set,"Although it is nice to have all six years in one place, it would have been nice to know that it came without special features of any kind. Each DVD actually has LESS than the original versions DVDs. I was very disappointed. When sets come out if would be nice if all variations came out at the same time, so people have a choice in format, special features, or versions (like director's cuts). I would have paid more money for a ""fully loaded extended addition with new special features"" if it had been offered at the same time. Now, I will not buy another set for this movie, since I already have one.This is a missed opportunity for fans and Amazon. People WILL buy within the spectrum of offerings. I am very wary now of buying any sets in the future, knowing that more features means a longer wait. The longer customers have to wait to get the type of DVD set they desire, the less likely they may be to buy them at all."
3,product quality,"I purchased this collection for my 6y.o.child. The set itself is a good idea, however,the sound quality is poor, too quiet and bonus features are not there. I had to turn the sound volume all the way up on the TV to be able to hear it, yet, it's not enough.The picture quality is good. Well, what I paid-that's what I've got."
2,Overpriced,"UPDATE: The price of Harry Potter Years 1-5 was raised back up to $[...], which is questionable, but means that your best value is this set, Harry Potter Years 1-6. You're getting all six released Harry Potter films at a very low cost, in packaging that is going to save you space on your shelf. A great gift for any Harry Potter fan who doesn't have the films yet, or only has one or two.Harry Potter Years 1-5 can be purchased for $[...] and Half-Blood Prince can be purchased seperately for $[...]. That's a grand total of $[...] for the same films in this gift set (Years 1-6), except it wont cost you $[...]. That's roughly a $[...] savings if you don't buy this set."
2,scenes omitted,"While I love the full screen version, I noticed that scenes have been omitted, like a previous reviewer mentioned. I had not seen Half Blood Prince, and now I wonder what has been left out. I will probably buy individual movies now to see what this box set has left out, after I go to my local library and check out other versions. Kind of disappointed, but since I love the series, I'll bear my disappointment like Dumbledore said, ""we must rise above our anguish, Harry, and battle on."""
1,Not the full movies!,"Where does it describe that these movies have been altered and are not the full versions? I would have NOT bought this version had I known!! Is this what you mean by ""full screen version""?? Completely disappointed in my purchase! What a rip off!"
4,Harry Potter DVD set 1-6,I thought this was a good deal to get all 6 DVD's. No problems of any kind. Did not enjoy the movies nearly as much as the books but I thought the casting was wonderful and the sets and special effects were very good.
1,Unhappy about missing parts -,It should have stated upfront that there would be NO storyline because of the severely edited out content. Is this what Widescreen means?
3,Harry Potter Years 1-6 A Ok with my 10 year old BUT...,"Harry Potter 1-6 Gift Set represents a comprehensive compilation of JK Rowling's previous works in a smart economic package. However, what I did not know is that this particular offering is alphamorphic wide screen which apparently means that the screen size is in the original movie dimensions with horizontal banding above and below the picture. I guess that is what a movie purest may opt for due to it's authenticity. I like the image to completely fill the entire TV wide screen without manipulation. The subtitle option is very interesting in this version since it is extended into the lower band region.Examining the product descriptions on both Amazon and the packaging of the HP set--I have not as yet found indication of using the alphamorphic wide screen format, hence the surprise and minor frustration, especially for 6 movies costing a hefty chunk of change."
1,why this box set is dumb.,"Here is why this box set is dumb. In a year, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I will be in theaters. In a year and a half, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II will be in theaters. In two years, both will be available on DVD/Blu Ray/digital/whatever might be out in two years. why bother with a box set for a 7 year story that only has the first 6 years? Especially as most fans have probably been buying the previous sets and or the individual movies and thus is even more stupid."
3,great start off,Add's textures and models helps u get startedthere is also two more add on's for carrara not posted hereon amazon so u might want to visit Eovia's home page.
2,Ehhhhh....,"I recently purchased this and found some problems with it. Apparently, St.Clair Vision cannot afford to restore any films on their DVDs. Some of the Laurel and Hardy solos are good, but the technology is available to restore these films. The Buster Keaton films are of poor, grainy quality and feature inadequate music. They look like they were transferred from a VHS tape. Swing Parade abruptly stops in the middle of the DVD and shuts my DVD player down. The ""stunt reels"" are just clips pulled together from films already on these discs. The 4 three stooges Columbia shorts are released often and can be found, fully restored on The Three Stooges Collection DVDs, which I own. The General, College, and Steamboat Bill, jr can be found in better quality on the Keaton DVDs released by Kino. I am a fan of all of these comedians, but better quality and better presentation will be found elsewhere. Dont waste your money on this."
5,Great music,"This is an excellent CD, recommended! She writes a lot of her own material, and it s hard to categorize her because she seems to sing what moves her, and she does it well. Kind of a Dusty Springfield sound. And if you have a chance to see her in person, go, because she does a great show."
4,Just shy of greatness...,"I love the soul influences on this album along with the echos of Lucinda Williams. What knocks it down from 5 stars are the Sheryl Crow lite tracks that are a too obvious attempt at having a hit single. Otherwise, this is a fine effort."
3,"Flawed, overproduced sophomore effort","Maybe it's that I discovered Tift by way of Bramble Rose, but I have to agree with moose_of_many_water's review above; she's a talented artist but this isn't the album that's going to get her to stardom. It hearkens back too much to Dusty Springfield without ever giving us a reason to think she's found her own voice here. That's not to say this album doesn't have its moments, but nothing here demands your attention the way ""Trouble Over Me"" did on her previous album. If anything, TOO much money has been spent on this album; she would be better served to go back to more intimate productions, perhaps a la Willie Nelson's Red-Headed Stranger."
4,Middle of the road,"Not quite country, not quite pop but quite good. Not sure why she's gotten so much hype compared to other artists that are her equal and remain unknown-good agent I guess. But it's a fine album."
5,Amazing Talent!,"I just saw Tift in concert. She is an amazing singer, and this cd is awesome. I bought it recently, and I can't get enough of it. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,"Second album by an amazing artist, but not quite as good...","I love Tift Merritt's music. I think Bramble Rose is a truly amazing album. My favorite track is ""When I Cross Over."" Like a good song should, it makes my hair stand up and my eyes water. I was really looking forward to her next album, which finally arrived two years after Bramble Rose. Unfortunately, it's not as good as Bramble Rose. Bramble Rose was more country, whereas this album seems to use more rock, soul and pop structures. That should be a good thing, but I wonder if she's trying to appeal to a larger pop audience. Tift sounds very confident on this second record, but somehow I liked the more melancholy sound of the first album."
2,No So Interesting,"My wife introduced my to Tift Merritt's music when we were dating ... so I've got a soft spot for Tift and was really looking forward to hearing her second album, Tambourine. I'm disapointed.There's not mush to this album. It's lost the alt-country sound and is more of a boring pop album. Bramble Rose is much, much more interesting."
4,Strong 2nd Album from Tift,"After hearing/owning Bramble Rose, I hurried out to get this one when I heard it had hit the stores. And indeed, it proves to be a worthy follow-up to her first CD. The sound is more sophisticated and more sensual. And some of the songs here represent clear steps forward in songwriting for Tift Merritt. My only complaint on this album is that it seems to be reaching just a bit too hard for that ""Dusty in Memphis"" white-girl soul. On the last album, it worked on the song ""Sunday"" because it was a more subtle, slow-burning type of soul that better suits Tift's voice. Here, at times, the soulfulness of the album comes off a litte forced. But if you can get past that, the songs are good stuff. My personal favorites are ""Laid a Highway"" ""Stray Paper"" and ""Aint Lookin Closely"""
4,Worth it.,"I first heard Good Hearted Man on KNBT in New Braunfels TX and thought Tift sounded a lot like Emmylou Harris (which is a compliment to be sure), although the song didn't impress me all that much. It wasn't until I heard Write My Ticket that I realized her depth as a songwriter. I'm a sucker for a good redemption song, and Ticket gets to me like Delbert McClinton's cover of the Otis Redding classic Dreams to Remember, and that's about as good as it gets.... I bought the CD and the rest is history. Ms. Merritt has talent, both as a performer and songwriter, and that's a rarity in this day and age. She's destined for bigger things than Americana radio, and good for her."
5,Jello holders,"Used these at my kids ""mad science"" birthday party to put the ""radioactive goo"" aka jello in. perfect little dishes."
1,NOT STERILE!,"I just bought a sleeve to use to create cultures of a few different edible mushrooms and to isolate a yeast strain that I use in brewing. I used 10 other Pyrex petri dishes at the same time as a control as well as to have enough dishes for what I was doing. Two days after pouring the agar and all 20 of the plastic dishes have heavy contaminate while the ten Pyrex dishes are perfectly fine. I've been doing this for years and my sterile technique nor my flowhood is not to blame, these petri dishes were taped shut in a previously open bag and had holes all over the bag.These are far from sterile, buyer beware!"
5,Perfect!,"These petri dishes are exactly what I needed! I haven't used them yet, but they seem very sturdy and can probably withstand anything in your laboratory! Shipping was also very fast!"
5,Question Before I buy.,"The price is a great for a 20 pk petri dish, but before I buy it, does this product come with caps?"
4,Easy - Simple - Plain,"The problems given in this book were very easy to understand. The author shows step by step how to do the given problems and the answers are refferenced in the back. I always used how the book did the problems, not the teacher's way. I am always coming back to this book to refresh my math skills."
5,46 years of experience condensed,"I always believe that information is most applicable in ""context"". This review comes from someone who is at the beginning of their management career. I have been working with PricewaterhouseCoopers for over three years now and am beginning to assume greater professional management responsibilities.Not only do I think that this book is excellent and its 7 rules applicable to anyone looking to ""Get Ahead"" in their career, I have had the pleasure of working alongside Mr. Scovil as we both serve as members of the Board of Advisors for the non-profit organization AIESEC at Georgia Tech.This book condenses 46 years of professional experience into 7 simple rules. Not theory, not guesswork...this comes from someone who was CEO of a major international corporation! I'm sending a copy to all my friends in management and leadership positions."
2,has a few gaps,"The book is of PDE topics, with the understanding that you have a well mastered trig through calculus 3, and can recall them from memory.The book requores some on-line studying to find worked examples of the concepts instead of brief overviews."
2,Views from the student,"Having just taken this course from Professor Gustafson, I can say, with complete support from everyone in every PDEs class he's taught as of yet, that this book leaves a lot to be desired. There is absolutely no mention of separation of variables, the section on greens functions forgets to mention at all what they're used for, and further how to do anything with them, and numerous other grave omissions. I feel a more apt title would be: ""An overview of PDE's for the advanced student, and interesting applications."" So perhaps, for the right teacher this will be a fine book, but beware, you are going to have a lot of work filling in the large gaps the book leaves.Also, thought this has no bearing on the quality of the book, he has a strange obsession with the number 3."
3,Tough to keep together...,"...But what do you expect when handling a model of the human body?! Even though it's frustrating to keep all the pieces together, it's a good learning tool. My 3-year-old was interested about the skeleton and other things inside his body so I found this on Amazon. I usually purchase based on review strength, and this had none, so I took the chance. My son has learned, and I have learned. But there are body parts all over the living room!! Also, the product description isn't great...This item comes in a board game-sized box, has white and red paint and a brush to paint the muscle lines...and there is no ""game."" It's just a 12"" replica of the human body."
5,Excellent Material,"After reading others comments and seeing that it was comb bound I was a little worried about ordering the book. Once I got the book I found that it is an excellent source of information on inventing toys. This is an area I have been searching for information on for a while. I have often found books that discuss the mechanics of developing the product and selling it to companies. What this book has over many others is information on inventing and creativity. It provides exercises to help with generating creative energy and inventing new ideas. This book is exactly what I was looking for and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in developing toys and just needs help getting started on creating ideas. After all, you need to have the toy idea before you can create a business around it."
3,Uranium Rock,"A mix of rockabilly and country songs. Rockabilly songs are great (""Miss Froggie"", ""Ubangi Stomp"", ""Tonight Will Be the Last Night"", ""Rock & Roll Ruby"",...) but country songs are sometimes little boring. ""Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache"" is originaly his but Bob Luman made the hit. The sound quality is not the best, but it's ok! And of course all songs are recorded at legendary Sun."
1,not worth the bother,"I found A Dark Night's Work to be very tedious to read as it gets too bogged down in old fashioned, formal language and social class ideals. The story, although potentially interesting, is very slow moving and in the end i decided not to waste time finishing it. Apologies to the author,but that's how I see it."
3,Not a how-to,"Given the back of the book, it is easy to assume this a how-to book, another guide for the customer from Itiel. But this is really more of an autobiographical account of his own lifestyle choice to focus on the use of hustlers or male prostitutes. A solid definition of ""virtual boyfriend"" isn't even offered and the ""how-to"" parts are very few and far between. If you read his first book and thought he was an interesting man, you might like this. If you want to know how to get a virtual boyfriend, you mostly need to figure that out for yourself."
3,Nice Little Mystery,"Caught Dead in Philadelphia was Gillian Robert's first mystery novel and an instant success. The story profiles high school English teacher Amanda Pepper, an attractive young woman whose life is turned upside down when a co-worker she barely knows comes to her for help, and is later found dead in her apartment. I could not figure out who the murderer turned out to be. Roberts writes in the first person with a lot of humour, although sometimes she overdoes it a little with the jokes. I will definitely be going back for more mystery novels featuring Pepper by Roberts."
3,Where was the mystery?,"Although I enjoyed the humor of Roberts' writing while I listened to this book on tape, I felt like the solution to the mystery came up a little lacking. I don't enjoy it when the motive lies within a situation that the reader can't possibly know about (and isn't TOLD about) until the end of the book). I felt like the witty writing style was annoying at times, as if it was covering up for a weak mystery.I did, however, very much like the developing relationship between Amanda Pepper and C.K. McKenzie. I'm usually bored by the seemingly mandatory ""lead character falls in love with the detective"" plot, but in this case, I very much enjoyed it. Maybe it was the excellent reading of the story by the narrator?I am holding out hope that the next book in this series will have a stronger mystery."
2,"There was no ""there"" there","I opened up this web page with the intent of reviewing the last book I completed. I finished the book less than a week ago, and no kidding, I had to rack my brains to remember what book it was (I looked it up under the ""Your Account"" link of the amazon.com page). Then I had to rack my brains to recall what the book was about. That should tell you something.The author's writing is lively and witty but the plot was weak and forgettable. By the time I got to the end, I really lost interest in who the culprit was. I had a hard time caring throughout this book.I would give Roberts another try, recognizing that this was a first novel."
5,"So simple, even my child would do it.","I bought my first SproutMaster years ago at the Dowling Orchard Market when passing through Banning, California (back when they sold them).Through a bit pricey for a plastic tray, I cannot complain about the ease of use or the quality of the sprouts grown. The divider IS helpful to grow different sprouts, BUT it is more helpful to grow the same type of sprout in two different stages of growth. This way, you can always have fresh sprouts handy at anytime.They do grow fast and the Sprout Master makes it so simple to care for them."
2,Not sticky,I bought this paper in hopes of papering my world and everything in it yellow but alas the darn stuff just won't stick. I am happy that the product was cheep and was available on Prime because I would not buy this product again.
2,Just a rehash of other Tae Bo Workouts,"I bought this one hoping to get some ideas for my martial arts classes I teach children. I found it was just a rehash of other Tae Bo videos with kids working out with Billy instead of adults. The moves are basically the same. Having taught kids martial arts for 10 + years, I doubt if most kids would get into this video. After doing it a few times I think most kids would be back to the video games. IMO, kids would find this boring...I find it after a few viewings boring. I think Billy could have engaged the kids in more fun activity while working out. If you're into Tae Bo and want the kids to do it with you, then try this one. Otherwise if you want the kids to exercise, get them out of the house and into a fun activity that will be varied and not bore them."
2,Not as good as I thought it should be,"This video was a little disappointing. It really didn't appear to me to be kid friendly. Billy does a good job with the adult Tae-Bo, but he didn't seem to have it with the kids. Besides I think most of the movements were the same for the kid's Tae-Bo as they were for the adult Tae-Bo. I didn't care for this, I thought he could have been more creative. In my opinion Billy should stick to adult exercise videos. If you want a good kid's exercise video, check out Kick to Get Fit Jr. For Kids, Rich Grogan shows what creativity is all about."
1,Not a Good Children's exercise video,"This video is NOT very good for kids. The movements are very similar, if not the exact same as the adult Tae-Bo video. Kids are kids and they need to be treated & respected as kids. Sure this video has children doing (attempting) to do the movements, but it is not at all children oriented. My families personal favorite is Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, Rich Grogan realizes that kids are kids, and should be treated accordingly.Sorry Billy, pretty good job with the adult video, POOR job with the children's video."
4,Great for kids,"I use this frequently with second-graders. We have a weekly exercise class with 3 other classes. It gets them moving, and the boys really like it. One word of caution, you have to set ground rules (lots of room around each kid, no touching or hitting or kicking others). The only problem is that Billy gets quiet at times when he's giving really important information (like how to kick safely without locking your knees). Most kids can't hear this info in a crowded room."
5,great workout!,Bought this video spring of 2003 for my 5yr old daughter. We love it ! It's a bit fast for my daughter but she loves it anyway and still does her best. It is not just great for kids but also for anyone interested in starting Tae-Bo. I would definately recommend this video before starting the adult version. When you finish this video you will have a lot more energy and feel great!
2,Basically the same thing as the regular Tae Bo,"A little to hard for kids IMHO, but if your kid is a work out freak or something, I guess this would do."
4,FUN!,"THIS IS A GOOD VIDEO AND U GET A GOOD WORK OUT FROM IT, AND U CAN LOSE WEIGHT, AND U STRECH AND STUFF BEFORE AND AFTER TO WARM-UP/COOL-DOWN!! BUY IT TODAY!"
1,Wrong,The page states size D but the thread was size 00. I didn't open it until after 30 days and now I am stuck with it. :(
1,Tell me what is worse...,"Spending a night ""in"" Paris, or spending more than two seconds listening to her album? Well, I must say I gave a good ten seconds thinking of both options with delicate care. Which such a question deserves. However, after those seconds passed I totally forgot that I didn't care and I went back to listen to more Vital Remains. So, you want a review? An opinion? Don't buy it, unless you like being beaten in the street, which any sane person would do when viewing somebody with this in therr walkman."
1,Rotten Underbelly,"The Chinese are making cars, furniture, and appliances. We are making this rot and buying it. Celebrity, celebrity, celebrity. Do you know that this idiot charges six figures to attend events and parties? This is one more signpost that the culture and civilization of the USA is sliding downward at an ever-increasing rate. Yuck. What tripe."
1,FAIL,"Then the retards at MTV allow Paris to become a music star as an alternative to her questionable career. She quotes, ""WEN U PUT IT 2GETHER, U GET A MAGIKAL AXPERIANCE!!!""Yes such a magical experience. This beautiful 2 star average surely makes it magical. This is music for posers and preppies, that's all!"
1,She's the antichrist!!! The ANTICHRIST I TELL YOU! Check the back of her neck for 666!!,"Acting, porno, reality TV, MUSIC?!! My GOD she's everywhere. what is she trying to do, take over the freggen WORLD!!! If she likes the sound of her own voice than i guess this star is DEAF!! She is only making a fool of her self by trying to do everything. especially since she's NO GOOD AT IT!! She's plastering herself everywhere and becoming some sort of novelty, and She's so stupid, she ought to be sold at SPENCER'S!! this girl thinks that everyone loves her and that she's a total goddess. What is she, the antichrist? Someone check her for the 666 mark!"
3,It's a good Reggae tune,"I don't know if she wrote the tune herself but it's a pretty solid Reggae beat.(In a sugary pop sort of way which is exactly how alot of current Jamaican Dancehall Reggae sounds like) I consider myself a huge Reggae fan (I even went to Jamaica to buy vinyl 45s and dubplates)and I can honestly say that I like this song. I don't consider it classic Reggae music but after I heard it I was not only impressed that Paris did such a good job on the vocals but also that she did a Reggae song at all. She doesn't have much of a vocal range but then again some of the greatest singers didn't either. That's what microphones and reocording studios are for. Give her a break, maybe she did spend a ton of money on the best recording facilities and staff but sometimes even that's not enough to make a good pop song. I usually can't stand non Jamaican Reggae but for some reason I like Paris's Stars Are Blind."
3,PLEEEASE!,"OH C'MON PPL, GIVE HER A BRAKE, PERSONALLY I DONT LIKE PARIS HILTON BUT WHO CARES IF SHE CANT SING OR DANCE, OR READ, SHES JUST AN ENTERTAINER, JUST LIKE A CLOWN OR A WHALE, IF U DONT LIKE HER MUSIC, WELL JUST TURN OFF THE TV OR CHANGE THE STATION. IF SHE WANTS TO F***K, LET HER F...! (WELL THAT ALREADY HAPPENED, N WE ALL SAW IT!)AND IF SHE WANTS TO SING LET HER SING! THE WORLD OF MUSIC WONT END BCUZ SHE IS SINGING, WE SURVIVED TO MR. BRUCE WILLIS!"
4,"Paris brings the Paris in most people! This song is awesome, period.","Truth of the matter is Paris brings out or taps into the true nature of many of us. And you know damn well what I am talking about. So, don't dismiss something on the merits of your immature, pretentious, and uninformed self. Since this is a song, listen to it. Question is can you drop all your preconceived notions and allow yourself to appreciate things as they are? Most self-righteous and unsophisticated folks won't be able to. But then again, I don't think you're her target audience. More power, Paris Dear! :)"
4,REALLY GOOD,"PARIS, SOUNDS VERY GOOD, I THOUGHT SHE WOULD DO A VERY CLUB-EY SONG SO THEY CAN TWICK HER VOICE, BUT... SHE CAN SING, THIS MAY BE JUST A NICE SUMMER SONG, BUT I THINK LATER SHE WILL SHOW US SOME REAL TALENT, HER VOCALS ARE A MIX OF GWEN S. AND BLONDY, WITH A TOUCH OF BRITNEY, ALSO HER NEW SONG TURN IT UP IS ALL READY GETTING ATTENTION, FOR TALENT YOUR HOT PARIS...."
1,What the ????????????,"I came across this ""gem"" of a video while channel surfing. Needless to say, I did not watch very long. The music sounds lame,overproduced and her vocals are terrible. On a side note, the video portrays this skank as she truly is: a spoiled, ridiculous ho that has the brains of a pet rock. If people would stop eating up all the garbage that she endorses, maybe she would stop!? Just a thought."
1,"Stars are Blind?, Are you Blind to buy this junk?","Stars are Blind are just blind with awfulness, paris hilton is so untalented, she makes Jennifer Lopez & Britney Spears look like documentary, this song is idiotic, silly and just plain godawful.Hilton cannot sing, nor she has any real talent, she's a waste of time, the only reason that she is the business is because of her wealthy family.Stars are Blind are just blindly godawful, hilton is a musical version of sharon stone."
1,atleast she won't be worried about illegal emule downloads....,"In the words of the oh so famous philosopher Andrew Dice Clay: ""talking to her was like masturb... with a cheese grinder, slightly amusing, but mostly painful"" except here, she's not talking she's ""singing"".Actually, this was a bet between a friend of mine and me, we heard the samples from barnes and nobles; the bet was, how long you could last without having our ears bleed. He actually managed to last 15 sec, considering all in all, pretty darn good.I'll tell ya, between her and ""tila tequila"", music is dying a long and painfull death."
1,1 star is too much for this muck.,"Just listen one song and you know it is schlock.No Beatles, no Dylan, no James Brown but also no Madonna.....This has no perspective, it's only muck."
2,"Horrible, absolutely horrible","This song, as well as the album is really, really bad. I tried so hard to give her the benefit of the doubt, but in the end, she proved to be no more a singer than she is an actress. Listen to it online, but don't even think to pay money for it. Give it another month or two and you'll be sick of this song and wish you'd never bought the album. It's really not worth it."
1,Daddy...Can I Have A Record Deal???,"What started as a spoiled little girl has now become a nationwide phenomenom, and there isn't an end in sight! Paris Hilton has become a household name for all the wrong reasons. She is a blonde, brainless heiress who has never had to lift a finger or break a sweat, yet she gets exactly what she wants!The only reason this song is so popular is catchy rythym and a funky beat. Paris obviously did not sing this, nor does she have any understanding of how much work, effort and thought goes into creating REAL MUSIC.However, all the sheep (and I don't mean the ones that go BAAAA!) will rejoice. Another catchy, bubblegum pop melody that will soar to the top of the charts, only to vanish later as yesterday's sad, pathetic news.Please."
1,Paris? a singer?,"The expression on her face says, ""what? I just woke up."" Her singing talents leave much to be desired. Her vocal quality is very juvenile and she needs a vocal coach. There is no ""meat"" to the music - it is simplistic and lacks depth, not only in melody but in lyrical qualtiy as well. This is just her lates fling funded by dear ol' daddy. This star is definately blind... to reality.And who would pay 17.99 for 5 versions of the same crappy song??"
1,do not support this...,not when there are REAL musicians out there with real talent that are roughing it to present their art to the world. This is a disgrace to music. period.
1,the excrement of an heiress,"this is anti-music. just another example of how money is able to buy your way into the recording studio. as if she didn't waste enough money. what a contribution to society she is, ain't she?"
1,The Day Music Died,"I must admit that I almost cried when I heard that Paris Hilton was releasing an album. Why? Is the only question that I kept asking myself. This was a very sad day for true artists everywhere It's like Paris woke up one morning and said,"" I want to like make a like album like because it will be like way fun and awesome."" and a record company said ""Okay Paris since your blonde and rich you can make an album."" I now see that money getsyou almost anything even talent that doesn't exist. I have lost respect for the music industry. Whatever record label, company or whatever Paris is signed under..they need to be sued. This type of crap should not exist, should never have been made and anyone who actually spends money on this crap needs to seriously evaluate themselves because it's not a good sign. R.I.P Music Industry because you are no longer living"
1,"All 1 starers, esp. Eggplant, are absolutely 100000000000000000% correct","Eggplant, kudos to you for writing another great and true review.For real music, listen to Dream Theater and Symphony X."
1,paris you suck,give it up you have plenty of money from your parents. Could you possibley need more money. please come on you can't even sing.
1,Worst CD ever,"I wasted my money on this, don't even know why I bought it. Paris Hilton can't sing! Her songs are horrible on this CD. Don't waste your money!"
4,PARIS ROCKS!!,"I love Paris and can't wait until the CD comes out. So what if she goes out and has a good time, So what if she has sex. WHO CARES! Let the girl live her life. I'm sure we all danced until the early hours, or did things we are not ashamed of..PEOPLE GET A LIFE and STOP BASHING my GIRL..I LOVE YOU PARIS!"
4,ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE PURCHASE,"I humbly disagree completely with the reviewer below.The ""live track"" that he doesn't name is an 8:20 live version of ""Pallas Athena"" (AKA the ""Tao Jones Index"" on the Japan '07 mini-sleeve edition).Anyone who enjoyed the original ""Pallas Athena"" from the ""Black Tie White Noise"" album, or the subsequent remixes of that track, will certainly dig this version.It is a compelling listen, with a hypnotic, pounding rhythm track, and is worth the price of this disc by itself."
2,"Bowie's ""Seven Years in Tibet"" single is a bit to normal.","When you go out and buy a single, it usually just has the original version, and maybe a few remixes that sound very similar to the original. With some of his more recent singles, David has had great remixes that add more depth to the original version of the song. This isn't true in the case of ""Seven Years in Tibet"". It contains three versions, the original, the mandarin version, and a 8 minute long, live track that gets kinda boring. The song is great, but the this single just doesn't do it."
2,Fantastic film - Bad reproduction,"As anyone who would read this already knows, this film is a five-star, must-have for any collection. However, this DVD offers a VERY POOR reproduction of the film with highlights blown out in many scenes and a general loss of the black-and-white tonality that made these films great. It was obviously reproduced from a print that was many generations from the master.Too bad, because the sound track is reproduced well.My VHS tape has better video. I'm sorry I gave it away when I ordered this DVD."
3,Not a woman's watch,"This is not a woman's watch. It's larger than expected. While I didn't expect a delicate watch, I also didn't expect a watch as large as most men's watches. Also, it takes a fair amount of hand strength to work the buttons (which is alright for most watches because you don't use them that often). However, with a smart watch you are working the buttons quite a bit and this would become fatiguing quite quickly. The plus side is that the buttons are easily accessible."
1,Does not work in the UK!,This watch does not work in the UK. Its a nice paperweight as its quite large and heavy!
5,Why the R rating???,"Every time that I've seen this movie, I have to ask the question: How come that ""Firestarter"" got the R rating instead of PG-13? I feel that this movie should have gotten the PG-13 rating because there isn't enough stuff in this movie that could have supported the R rating. Yes, there is a ""Armageddon"" like ending in ""Firestarter"" but there is a difference between the two."
3,She has the power.,The book is good but I don't understand why it was only suitable for persons of 18 years and over? There isn't happening that much which you can't see in a regular cartoon. But it's an oldie and maybe they thought it would upgrade the story. I liked David Keith and George C.Scott the played well. A must to see for Stephen King fans but also read the book...
3,colud of been a little better.,"This is not the best film based on a Stephen King book, but you can lok at it thi wa, at lest it is not as bad as IT (nothing colud be as worse as that). any way Drew Barrymore did a good job, but Martin Sheen eats up all the scenes and going all out in his role. all i can say about the story is it is about a little gril who gets things on fire when she is pissed off and there is this really f***ed up Indian guy. it is siad that that John Carpenter was going to do this. he sound have (hey man he can always do another film verison). by the way i am 17 years old, it is does that i don't know how to sing up and all that. nuff siad."
1,More annoying than scary,"Federal agents spend two hours provoking a girl with dangerous powers. Gee, I wonder what happens?"
3,Big Screen adaptation of King novel,"This film was one of the first King adaptation movies I saw. I have actually bought this myself to own, though this is mainly because of the concept (original at its time) of a pyrokinetic child.As with most King adaptations, the film doesn't compare to the book. It looses the pain and suffering of her father, and the strange effects he has on people (specifically, the man fascinated by his waste disposal unit....).However, it is an enjoyable yarn. The special effects are quite good for the time, and the sight of a six year old loosing control over such a deadly force is enough to make most people shudder. I would recommend buying it for the scene at the farm alone!It is not a brilliant film, though. You can poke holes in it if you're in the mood, and there is no real horror or terror there, it's just fun. Try renting it first!"
3,DVD is NOT widescreen!!,"I am commenting on the specific product listed, not the film itself. The film is fine. The DVD is misleading. It says it's 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but it's within a 4:3 frame (let's see if amazon accepts my product info recommendation). So it's basically a letterboxed standard def. video. If you play it back on an HD TV, then be prepared for black all round the video - the black from the letterboxing and the black that the TV puts on the sides because the film is 4:3 video. Some TVs might blow it up at the correct aspect ratio to fit the screen. Ours does not. It's either watch it small or stretched.I suppose this DVD is older, from when widescreen was kind of a new thing. My recommendation would be to just buy to Firestarter 1 and 2 Franchise collection DVD - I suppose since that's newer, it would be anamorphic. ...Or perhaps a bluray version will be out at some point?"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A faithful retelling of Stephen King's pageturner, Firestarter hits all the notes of the novel without hearing any of the music; simply a mediocre film, it's entertaining enough without being any good."
3,An ok watch,"Its an ok movie. I'd watch it once,but I wouldn't pay to watch it twice. For an older movie it didn't look as fake as I thought it would.Its an ok movie. I'd watch it once,but I wouldn't pay to watch it twice. For an older movie it didn't look as fake as I thought it would."
4,"Ahh, the early days :)",This movie was awesome in the day and still holds some valuable elements of entertainment. Watched it with my daughter(17) and told her to disregard the special effects. She enjoyed it.
3,ShowBuyGal,"This machine ONLY works for Avery brand labels.It seems to be programed certain marks and thickness.Does not feed other brands (such as OfficeDepot) and if it did, it jams.I just got this today and within 30 seconds, already broke it because of jams. It can be fixed, but make sure to use Avery labels."
5,Outstanding value,"Of all of the bible study books I have, this inexpensive reference is far and away the best value. I like it better than my Little KittleTheological Dictionary of the New Testament, and it is about half the price. It works best with the Mounce InterlinearThe Zondervan Greek and English Interlinear New Testament (NASB/NIV), which also uses GK rather than Strong numbering. These two books are the best money you could spend for original language word study. I find them exciting.For those who would prefer to start with English rather than Greek, the Mounce dictionaryMounce's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words, is well written, compact and very useful. But it cannot equal Verbrugge's Greek based dictionary for insight and enlightenment. Choose the Greek based reference if you are at all up to it. It is not all that difficult, and well worth the extra effort."
5,Essential for New testament Greek Study,I can't say more but only recommend this book to you. It is concise but comprehensive and give you more details than the size of the book suggests. One of the best books I have ever gotten in this year!!!!
4,The Woman Behind the Scenes,I'm really glad I read this book. I gained a perspective of Oral Roberts Ministry that could only come from his wife. They were an awesome couple. This book helped me realize the price that others paid for me to enjoy my faith in God today.
5,Must have for propliner fans,"Arthur Pearcy did a splendid job; a thorough work about propliners. Being in my forties I know propliners only from old movies and books. Pearcy's book took me to the beginning of commercial aviation, showed me ""how things used to work"" in those good old flying times. Also included,a rich number of unique photos collected from various sources and lot of data about Douglas propliners - it's what the title says; a real history from DC-1 up to DC-7c, including some less known facts from behind production line and airlines history. All main typs as well as subtyps of Douglas produced propliners are explained in tiny details, including some of them you probably never heard of their existence before. When you read this book you'll know for sure - jets are for kids."
2,capsules much too large,These capsules which contain the liquid primrose oil are a challenge to swallow. The capsules are quite large in size. This is a brand I will avoid buying in the future.
3,OK but not great,"Don't get me wrong, I love them but this is average compared to the 3 great albums which followed it. Only 4 stand out tracks for me : La Tristesse,Sleep flower,Life landslide, and 'From despair'. For some reason I cringe at 'Roses', why do so many like it ? The album often sounds amateurish to my ears. Buy Bible instead."
2,Too Slow and Too Easy!,This game is really slow. There is hardly any turbo and the gameplay stinks. Pond hockey mode is cool but it gets old. This game is very easy and the fighting is bad. The goalies lie down and make the same save every time. Then the goalies make too many hand passes. Don't waste your money.
3,Air brush goof but only for shorter hair...,Hot air brush is not bad but it does not work on long or curly hair... it gets mixed up and the fan burns the hair strands.
4,Great Import,"If you liked Mark Boals' work with Yngwie Malmsteen, this is a must purchase. The band is top notch; Tony McAlpine, Vitaly Krujic (sorry, forget the spelling...keyboardist with Artension)and others. This disc blows away the Malmsteen's dreadful ""War To End All Wars"". A bit keyboard heavy for my tastes, but excellent metal just the same. Too bad it will probably never see a U.S. release."
1,"This is so bad,its not even music,","I wish that I could return this trash. I have not even waisted enough time to hear the entire cd, but I don't need to eat the whole rotten pig before I know the meat is bad, and this is really bad. I can understand some one's opinion of heaven and hell. All I can say is that I would not stand next to this creep on a cloudy day."
1,Torn out pages,"The point of the workbook is to learn Sectional Anatomy by labeling the correct parts or filling in the blank on direct questions. The way that this book is set up is to answer the questions in each chapter and then to check the answers in the back of the book. Unfortunately, the previous owner tore out all the answer pages. This makes it impossible to know exactly what anatomical part the question was looking for.I would have returned this book, and had a good reason to, but I am working through deadlines and have to have the book for class. Needless to say, I am not pleased with this book."
4,Good book,This book is very helpful in understanding the different feelings that step families go thru when a couple marry. It has helped me understand not only some of the feelings that I was having but also to see what my children & step children may be feeling as well.
3,Good introductory Bowen novel,"Not the greatest novel in the world, but a good introduction if you would like to read Bowen. The lack of any real resolution to the plot is kind of disheartening and leaves the reader with a feeling of nothing being accomplished. Bowen writes about subtle emotions well, but throws out too many at the reader at once. The novel seems more of an intellectual excercise in form rather than a real literary accomplishment."
2,Wordy,"This is possibly the most boring book I've ever (nearly) read. A group of English people, mainly women, are spending the English winter in an hotel in Italy and trying to fill their days with inconsequential chatter and hints of malicious gossip. The conversations are tediously wordy and mostly about nothing of any interest, between people with few brains and less charm. I gave up half way through as I felt it was a pure waste of time and eyepower!"
3,Practical Boater Pontoon and Deck Boats,"This is a good, general overview about pontoon and deck boats. It does not go into too much depth, unfortunately, and is a bit dated. I wish it would have addressed anchoring as the initial moderator advised during the intro. It did not. Overall there were some very useful parts for the novice 'tooner. Especially the safety section on ""must have"" equipment, ""ought to have"" and ""nice to have"". Price of the DVD should have been a little cheaper."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered two books. Both read ""LIKE NEW"". The first was like new but this one was damaged. The front cover had a large chunk gouged out on the cover bottom and a smaller one on the top. It did not happen in delivery as there was a statement enclosed that the book had a SMALL chip out of the cover. This should not have been described as ""LIKE NEW"". There were other choices and had this been advertised properly I would have made another choice."
4,From a S. C. low country native,"After a cursery reading of De New Testament, I am amazed at the accuracy of the translation to written language from the spoken. The only criticism I have is that to really appreciate the Gullah dialect, you must hear it spoken. Without some familiarity with the sounds and inflections of the speach, one can't duplicate it. The only solution to this problem is to include a CD of selections from the text, which is somewhat impractical at this moment. This criticism not withstanding, I am very impressed with the results of excellent research and field work."
4,Worked OK for us,"We have a GE XL44 gas stove. Installation was all often seconds. We have a ""crawler"" not yet ""toddler"".So far, he can just reach the knobs and can't get enoughleverage from that angle to do anything. For us it'spretty easy to open and close the covers to use theburners."
2,lasted about a month,"Okay these things might work okay, but they are cheap cheap cheap. They broke apart pretty quickly offering no protection.So yeah, it may work. . .but then they break and you think to yourself ""yeah, that was a waste of money"""
1,Our cat could open it.,"Ok, not literally could our cat open it but once you install it it is very very easy to pry it off. You don't even have to use the button to open it just squeeze the sides in gently and ""pop"" off it comes. NOT safe."
2,"Not bad, not good either","Knobs are big and fit over our stove knobs just fine, that's good. The bad: After six months, two of the covers have broken off at the hinges. We needed to buy another set to fill in for the broken ones."
3,Worked great until broke,"These covers worked great for about month and a half we had them. But then one of them broke (the plastic part where the lid attaches to the base chipped off -- this is the mostly used burner, but we had it for only 1.5 months!) Now we have to get another set (since there is really no alternative) to replace the defective cover."
1,Don't work on a Thermador Professional Range,These simply don't fit a Thermador Professional Range. Your stove needs removable knobs as well as a flat surface under the knobs for these to adhere.
3,"Annoying, but keep little hands away from the controls.","I bought these when we moved into a house with a gas stove. It was an older stove, so maybe that was the problem? The covers fit just fine, except they made it difficult to open the oven without lifting all of the covers up at once. Even then, sometimes the knob and cover would fall into the hot oven. They may have just been too large, or maybe it was the design of the stove. It did keep my son from accessing the knobs though. After a few months of this, I purchased an electric stove, and problem solved."
3,"Not great, but they stop the kids from touching the knobs","My kids are well behaved, but like any kid they are curious. These stopped them from messing with the knobs because it wasn't as easy and with gas, that's important for more reasons than fire or heat.They only get 3 stars because they aren't very heat resistant, and frankly are a pain in the butt on my island range because the knobs are so close together. Now, if that wasn't part of the point they'd get two stars. But that's actually a feature to some extent. Ultimately the kids are now old enough that they know better so they are off.They fit the knobs well, and cause issues even for an adult to use, so that stops the kids pretty well.In the end, they did their job and I'm not sure there is much out there that are better."
3,Great if you have removable knobs,"Unfortunately, the knobs on my stove are not removable, so these can't be used. Did not realize that prior to purchase. They seem like they would work great otherwise."
3,Not too bad...Serves purpose.But I don't think it will last long.,I don't think they will last long and they are loose on the stove although they do the job they are designed for.
1,not child-proof at all,"my toddler can open these without effort. in fact, if i bump one of these covers with my hand, they pop open. i don't understand how these can be sold for the stated purpose; do not rely on these to kid-proof your stove, they are worse than having nothing because they can lull parents into a false sense of security."
2,Couldn't Open Oven,The theory of these are great. And they look well made and nice. The problem we had is that they actual hang quite low and in front of our oven door. It's impossible to open or close the oven without taking them off. You might want to measure if you plan on buying these. Ours actually got super hot as well and we were worried about melting. We returned them and now just take of the knobs and put them back on when needed. It's actually less hassle than these.
1,good solution; bad product,perfect solution for my toddler who insists on reaching for our gas stove knobs. unfortunately within 2 weeks 1 of the knobs has already broken. disappointing.
3,Better than Nothing,"We have a gas stove and these do the job, but the issue I have is the plastic melts from heat from the oven. Especially if you use the broiler. My kid is 2, and we have taught him to stay away from the oven, so these are more of a redundant solution (but still important to have). We just buy more when the plastic melts."
5,work good,"I have these on our stove, they work great, my kids will play w/ them every now and then, they are 1 and have not been able to open them yet."
4,important safety device,These gas stove knob covers are very helpful; My niece has a vigorous 2 year old who loves turning knobs
2,Questionable investment,"I bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface. THey fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around. Also a few of my knobs pull off easily. My son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come, both knob and cover. Then it's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover. They do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to. I'm just not sure if it's worth it. It probably depends on your stove."
1,Save your money.,"*These covers are not universal by any means. The knobs on my 10-year-old Kenmore won't even fit inside them. The covers are about 1/8"" too small in diameter.*They are big, bulky and unsightly, and they draw attention to the knobs, making them more interesting to curious toddlers.*And, as someone else stated, the latch to get them open has no give at all, you practically need a flathead screwdriver to pry it open.Too much trouble and not worth the money.Just take the knobs off and lock them away until it's time to use them."
4,I like it,I like this item its great to keep kids away from the oven. But 1 already broke due to opening and closing each time I turn the fire out.
2,Not childproof,"These locks seemed ok at first, but within a month of having them my 13 month old is able to open them with ease. Definitely not childproof!"
1,daughters new favorite rattle,"they lasted about an hour on my stove, untill my 2 yr old pulled them right off. now shes running around the house with her new favorite rattles. after getting them off the stove it only took her seconds to figure out how to open them. would not recommend product."
2,Breakable,"These knobs worked for my kids, however they had to be replaced multiple times already, as they break. If you cook a lot, these are not very resistant to breaking."
4,Perfect,Works just as you would expect so I would recommend this product to anyone looking to baby proof the kitchen
1,Kids figure them out,"I was very happy with these covers the first week. However, my 14 month old was able to learn within less then a month that if he just grabs and pulls, they come right open and he can get to the stove knobs. They may slow him down a little, but they definately do not keep him away from the stove knobs :("
1,My 13 month opened them instantly,"I never write reviews - but wanted to mention that as soon as I put these on, my 13 month walked over and open up the safety knob right away. Defeats the purpose to have these if she can open them. I removed them right way, as I didn't want anything on the stove that would peak her attention."
4,Functional & Easy to Use!,"These are a great, inexpensive solution to oven knob safety proofing.Pros:-Takes seconds to install-Easy to use- pinch to open, use knob, and easy shut-Nice looking- clear plastic allows you to see the actual knobs and isn't a huge eyesoreCons:-The knobs on our oven are pretty close together so the covers are hard to control"
4,"Lightweight plastic, but they work as promised","Easy to handle - simple push button opening. These are relatively cheap, scratchable/meltable plastic, but they work so far! Good for keeping active baby's hands from the gas knobs on the front of our oven (whoever designed ovens with these type of knobs is not so smart!!! haha)."
3,Work but break easily,"They do the job of blocking the knob. But where on our 3rd pack because if you leave it down while you're cooking and child is not around, it takes only a minor bump with the hip to shear the cover off. A better design wouldn't have a metal pin locked in plastic hinges that break; but plastic pin and hinges that can separate when hip-checked and then snapped back together. Just haven't been able to find something better"
4,safey,"they work well when comes to keeping the baby from playing with the stove. However, it is tricky to take off when needed to use it!"
2,Does not fit viking stoves,These covers will not work if you have a Viking or if you need to push in to turn the gas on. I wished they specify this in the product description so you don't to waste time buying and returning them.
1,Disappointing!,This product is a joke! My 20 month old figured out how to open them in 3 days. I now have resorted to taking the knobs off of my stove. Do not waste your money on these knob covers. They don't deter little hands!
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I just bought the knobs and they are terrible!!!! I have so much trouble opening them. DO NOT BUY IT!!!! IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY, it's better to just remove all knobs off your stove and use one when you need it."
1,More of a safety hazard,These fall off extremely easy and do not hold the knobs on. One feel off into my oven when I was baking. I've removed them for now.
3,Broke,"They worked for a while, and worked well until one of them broke. I still use the others, but I need to get another one for the broken one."
1,14 month opened immediately,"My 14 month old can open two at a time, one with each hand. I love the concept, but these are a joke. You're supposed to have to push the button to open them, but you don't, you can simply pull them open.Save your money!"
3,3 out of 5 ain't bad??,"I was excited to get ""new and improved"" covers for my stove knobs since my 1 year old son is much more curious than my daughter ever was! But, now, within 2 months of getting them, I only have 3 that work. One of the hinges melted causing the product to not open. We do use the broil once a week or so, but shouldn't the product be able to withstand heat? And more recently one came apart and the pin was not installed correctly to start with and we are trying to fix it. What a hassle. I do like the newer version of these they are much easier to use, we'll see if my son gets the hang of it too. I may have gotten a bad batch."
1,Does not work,"These stove knobs were highly recommended by my sister-in-law. However, as soon as we installed them, my 1 year old twins figured out how to open them. Waste of money."
2,covers cracked off (at least for us),"We thought (and still think)that these covers would be a good idea to have with 2 kids around the house. The problem is that plastic part that covers the stove knob, protrudes off of the stove an inch or two and within a few months they were all knocked off. This may only be a problem with us, since the stove is sort of in a position where people walk right by it and are able to swipe the covers off."
2,Too easy to open,"Our 1-year-old opened two of these in under 5 minutes. Also, they make the stove knobs more appealing to play with. These just don't work unless your kid is too short to reach them :-P"
2,stove knob covers,"worked for my first born, however when we purchased new ones for my second son he quickly figured them out. curious boy that he is quickly discovered how to open and close them and pull them off."
4,works great! but have to close them!,"They work great! Just make sure you close them, if you leave them open & run into them they break easy...so sad!! but wonderful idea, useful item, great baby shower gift idea! One piece of baby proofing I will never be without as long as there are little ones in my home!"
4,It's moderately operational,"It's not impossible to turn the stove on while the knob is covered with this item. So, as it's often said, these safety products are no replacement for proper adult supervision; look after your kid and use these items only to give you a precious minute to remove your child from danger. You see your kid playing with the knob covers, remove him/her from there."
2,child proofs the knobs; but not durable with constant use,Bought these knob covers about 2 months back. Easy to install and does make it difficult for my 2 year old to turn the knobs.Hinges on two of these covers have already broken with the constant opening and closing several times a day over two months. I am looking at the alternatives to replace this already.
4,Serves it's purpose...,"Purchased these when our Crazy, Active and Curious twins boys started walking (around 15 months old). My husband felt they were crap from the get go but I disagree. In my opinion, these products are simply an added deterrent...they do not replace the supervision of an adult nor should they. No, it wasn't the most convenient when I was cooking but it certainly stopped the boys from having the ability to adjust the knobs. As the boys have gotten bigger (and stronger) they managed to pop the top and break the hinges on two of the covers. The other three remain and I've moved the operable covers to the knobs of the back burners which I use if I'm cooking when the boys are up. They have since lost interest in the stove and knobs all together...all in all, I feel they served their purpose."
1,DS broke all these off,"They suck, my DS broke ALL of them off. I dont think i even had these for 2 months. Quality is not there- how can this work if the kids break them all off?"
2,Melting Issue,"My fourteen-month-old can just touch the knobs on the stove, now, so they haven't been tested by nimble toddler fingers yet. The issue that happened with me is when I used my broiler and left the door open to let the smoke escape, it melted two of the knobs at the hindges. Plastic...extreme heat...I should have known better. I had to do some repair work with a file to get them working again. I do find they open easy for me, and I'm not bothered by opening and closing them every time I need to cook. But if they open that easy, I'm nervous they may not work with my child. I guess at that point we'll just remove the knobs completely and store them out of site until we need to cook."
2,Does not fit all stoves,"I bought this as my large puppy had jumped up and hit it while everyone was at work or school and turned on the gas. It does not easily fit all stove but if it did it seems like a good product. Yes, she should have been crated at the time~"
1,NO HAPPY AT ALL,My son figured out how to open then before he turned 15 month old and now he is 21 month old and broke 2 of them.... so I am not very happy....
2,Nice idea but fragile hinge.,"These are great to keep our kids from turning on the stove, however the hinge joint is pretty weak and these are easily broken."
1,They don't work very well,"We read all the reviews and while mixed, we decided to try them out. The bottom line is that they don't really do the job. There are two problems with them: (1) it is pretty easy for our 20 month old child to remove them by either simply pulling on them and removing the knob from the stove panel or by unlatching them (he primarily just pulls on them and the knob with cover comes off; one of the reasons that the knobs come off easily is that the plastic covers take up space and therefore the knobs can't be pushed in all the way, therefore their ""grip"" on the stove is compromised), and (2) every time you need to use the stove you have to unlatch the covers which becomes burdensome.Anyway, we threw them in a box for storage after a few weeks of trying to deal with them. Unfortunately, i don't know what alternatives we have to address this hazard."
2,The hinges are super-weak and 4 out of 5 covers broke off with 18 months.,"These are a good concept, but the plastic that surrounds the hinge is so thin, that 4 out of 5 of these broke in the exact same place. A shame."
4,Exactly as described,Arrived on time and are exactly as described. Only improvement to be made is to include a rubber grommet that fits in the through hole that stops cover from resting on the actual knob.
3,Knob Covers,They serve the purpose of not letting children turn the knobs. The only thing i did not like about his product was that on my stove when you wanted to cook something you have to pull the knob off with the cover on it. Then open the knob cover to get the knob out to put back on the stove.
2,Broken Hinges,"Both base and cover are plastic, held together by a sturdy metal pin which acts as a hinge. Problem is that the pin is way sturdier than the plastic it's mounted in. I have 4 of these, and 2 are broken: the pin broke off from the base in one & the pin broke off from the cover in the other (plastic's not sturdy enough in either piece). Design problem is exacerbated by the fact that you need to pinch these to open them (take a circle and pinch it into an ellipse), which puts a lot of additional stress on the plastic."
5,These covers are great!,"I've been using them for 5 years now--the SAME ONES and they're fabulous! They're not hard at all to use (nothing like the doorknob covers--those things are annoying!) and they DO keep my children from touching the knobs, which is what they're for. I've never had a problem with the babies pulling them off or figuring out how to open the stove AND if they go towards the stove at all it gives me that extra split second to deter them that I might not have without them."
4,Other comment is inferior,"Well, I was buying my girlfriend stuff online, and I got her some shoes through spike angel,and I thought what the hell... why not get her a cheaper pair too, because she needed a red pair and... a girl can never have enough shoes. Came on time, size was right, but most of all I was surprised at the quality."
1,Come ON!,"there should be some kind of return policy. Or if there is, make the date line more expansive! Make sure you know your shoe size like the back of your hand because if theses don't fit, well, you're screwed!"
1,Didn't stop disgusting 'poop eating',"So it's obviously a disgusting habit that many puppies go through. I've read up as to why they do it whether it be lack of nutrients in their diet, or too rich of nutrients. I've also read that dogs can 'eat their poop' due to boredom, etc. I picked this product because I was able to get it fast, and because it has a money back guarantee. Long story short, I have a Chocolate Lab and he does not like eating these tablets, so I have to break them up into 4 pieces and mix them with his food and hope he doesn't pick around them. Regardless, I've been using these tablets for almost a month now and he still comes back with poop breath. I guess I'll just keep trying other products until I find something that works, because it's embarrassing to tell someone not let my dog lick them because he's a little poop eater. Maybe it'll work with your dog, but it sure didn't work with mine."
2,Not what I expected,"One of my dogs ate the tablets eagerly, the other dog refused to eat it. Can't really tell if it makes a difference."
1,Super thanks to review from Dublin,"Many, many thanks to the reviewer from Dublin. For future ex-pats from US (and other countries), does anyone have any recommendations?"
4,Lots of good suggestions,"The authors seem to have a world of experience with ADHD and ODD youth. Their first hand stories are insightful.The early chapters had very helpful ideas about dealing with defiant children. The later chapters, dealing with ""take downs"" and ""academy"", I found less helpful. They are essentially Behavior Mod techniques, in new guises.I can imagine that with younger children, perhaps under 9 or 10, these more coercive techniques might be effective. For young adolescents, one would need a lot of help. I understand the need for parental control, but that can be difficult to obtain if the problem behavior has gone on for too many years."
2,Useful? Sure. Revolutionary? Not.,"This book contains some interesting ideas about how to handle difficult children, though it's not clear whether the book is for MILDLY difficult kids or EXTREMELY difficult kids (for example, it's hard to imagine that parents with a mildly difficult child would ever need to use physical restraint). As a result, I'm not certain the book presents a coherent plan for dealing with EITHER type of difficult child. Some good advice is provided, but it's hardly revolutionary."
2,Okay except one thing,"I find the book quite useful in outlining strategies on dealing with non-compliant children. However, one thing I can't get past is the recommended 'hold down' approach. The authors justified that method with their experience, but I can't imagine what this teaches the child - 'I can hold you down because I'm stronger than you'. You can only do this for so long, and it advocates violence, no matter how they defend it. They said children actually become more loving as a result. Maybe those children just become more accepting of things because they deem their parents as unpredictable and willing to resort to 'violence'?"
3,Blogging Incomplete,"The range of products reviewed is impressive; however, the information on each of the products is incomplete. For example, Xanga is mentioned to have a comfy community, but no where is it mentioned that with Xanga it is impossible to get outside of their community. And the Xanga community consists of hundreds of thousands of tweens who want to know whether or not Bobby really ate a worm. Not for serious bloggers. It seems designed for and catering to Junior High School aged kids."
2,For beginners only,"This book is very simplistic and there is not a whole lot of information that you can't find by surfing the web and visting blogger.com. Very basic stuff. If you are totally new and wondering what blogging is and how to get started; the book is for you. However, if you have web development experience and a do-it-yourself mentality, look elsewhere. I was expecting some information about programming and setting up your own blog. This book is basically a how-to review of existing blogging services that one must subscribe to. It seems to contradict the ""Genius"" description in the title. If you have your own website and you want to do it yourself visit: http://www.....org/....htm. It's all free. I am not affiliated in any way with the recommended site, BTW."
2,puh leez,"The two stars are because there is information in the book, not at all bad. The information, that is. I'm sure many members of the beginner audience would enjoy the book.But here's why I'll never read it: I can't tolerate the snarky 'tude of the dude who wrote it. Hey ""Biz"", you're a child; hey ""genius"", you really managed to turn off those older than you, and fast too.There's enough of this kind of noise in the world of guidebooks. Aspiring blogger, if you're looking for information to get you started, you really ought to keep on looking."
2,ok-ish but do you really need this book?,"This book is neither bad or great.If you are new to blogging mess around, see how it works with a free blogger. If you need more you can move over to the likes of MovableType or wordpress. If you use blogger, ElizabethCastro has a new book about a specific solution ""publishing a blog with Blogger"" which goes into more actual detail about getting blogger to work for you. It is better. Mess around and read lots of other blogs. This book is really worth a miss."
3,Italian Charm,"I really liked the idea of this one, but it ends up being so small, you really can't see what it is. Anyone that sees my charm bracelet always has to ask me what it is."
4,full of practical information on ascension!,"My great thanks go to Tony Stubbs for channeling this book into written form. It was the first book I read on ascension, and it really kicked my butt!Stubbs comes from a technical background, so his writing is a bit more precise and practical than others in this field. He brings a light and chipper tone through the book, always keeping things upbeat and effortless.If you're into ascension teachings, try this book."
4,"Well put together, a good resource book","Lots of clear pictures, well organized book. From history, choosing a class to fine tuning of hulls and rigs. Tips on building your own boat from scratch. Even racing strategy."
2,Don't buy it for the spout!,"I was so excited to use my smoothie maker, and was almost instantly disapointed. I added all of the ice at once and it had a hard time blending the ice all up. The stir stick came in handy, without it I don't think the ice would have gotten chopped. Once I finally had the drink blended, it was to perfection - no ice chunks, which was very nice. Then the time came to use the spout. The smoothie dripped out extrememly slow - it wasn't worth waiting for. Pouring it out of the carafe was much easier. Overall, it's a good blender and really does a nice job on ice - but the spout leaves much to be desired..."
4,Surprisingly Simple!,"Was worried about this product's manufacturer because of various neg comments. But for us, this smoothie maker is just right. Although I ""gave up"" on the spout because it is too slow. The button to replace it doesn't fit snugly and leaks so I've just kept the spout on and pour through the top. We make smoothies daily for our morning boost and so far no problems. Once I thought it quit on me because it wouldn't start. (A problem that has been noted by several reviews.) BUT, I hadn't secured the lid properly. Once done, it works fine."
5,smoothie maker,"I was very leary when I ordered this...after I got and used it, I love it...the drinks are very smooth with no ice chunks"
2,Won't last if used regularly,"I received this as a gift great timing as I needed a new blender. I use a blender about 2-3 times a week we love smoothies incl. my kids so when we use it is not just a single serving. Well the bottom seal wore out within a couple of months, its difficult to screw on if you don't just get it exactly right. The spout falls apart which then causes more leaking, also the auto serve is useless for most cups because of its positioning. Overall one of the worst Back to Basics I have ever had."
3,Large Cardboard Blocks,"These blocks (40) come in a flat package and take a while to assemble, but once you do a couple, you have the hang of it. Kids in the 3 - 8 age range enjoy them, and they do have some education value by virtue of the different possibilities for constructing a castle. Don't, however, expect them to last long. With repeated play by children of this age, they don't have extensive durability."
4,"Not the best, but well worth the price","This is a great set for the new Chaplin fan. I bought this DVD set after falling in love with Charlie Chaplin's silent comedy and I loved it. Until I purchased the The Chaplin Collection it was over 14 hours of pure fun. Its a great collection of his work and although its far from amazing quality you cant expect way too much from such old film, some are now over 90 years old. For the experienced Chaplin fan I would not recommend this set theres much better quality to be found but for a substantially higher price. If your new to Chaplin's work this set is extremely affordable and enjoyable."
3,chaplin,"this collection isn't as good as a previous one that i bought(charlie chaplin:the little tramp).what makes it bad is the lack of respect for the material/artist.chaplin was G-O-O-D!!!he was,without a doubt,THE superstar of his era...the material was fantastic when chaplin put it on film.this collection has a great deal of his funniest/best routines,but they're barely watchable.this cuts the entertainment value down to zero..."
2,Terrible Quality,This may be a workout but I can't get past how poor the quality of the DVD is. It seems like she took her home video camera and made a workout video with it. Definitely not worth the money. Try Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Workout...it's my favorite!
1,Cheap production.,The exercises are nothing special. The background is depressing - a grayish cloth with a few fake flowers at the corners. Just can't take this while spending my precious time exercising and this is not cheap at $19. I will stick with the quality known names. This was returned the same day.
4,review for total body tone,"I am a personal trainer so I am a fairly advanced exerciser. I thought the instructor was clear and did a good job on the cuing. She was not annoying. I was a little disappointed with the routine itself. I thought it would be a little more challenging and creative. Probably challenging for a beginner or an intermediate person but not for an advanced person. It does cover the total body but if you have been exercising for a while, none of the exercises will be something new to you."
1,Please save your money and your child the stress,"This book was discarded from our library by the time we hit page 20. When teaching the suffix ar and or, this text states that the following words are examples of words with the SUFFIX AR and OR:SUGARLIARPASTORLEGISLATORPlease tell me, when did the letters SUG and LI become a proper word and what does one do who SUGs?Save your money, but most of all, save the stress you will put on your child with this poorly developed book. Proper English and Writing Technique should not be sacrificed to make it easier to pass a test. Two wrongs do not make a correct answer."
2,...............,"Product is poorly advertised. Here I thought I was purchasing a Basketweave Bianchi OC Spray Pouch when in fact its the Gloss finish version.In text the product states that it's ""High Gloss"" but displays a basketweave product. The products image should be updated so future costumers don't get more upset than I. Fortunately, the gloss finish doesn't look too bad on my belt, so I'll keep the product rather than waste more money for return shipping."
2,Was not impressed ...,I got this book a while back and never really found much use for it. The monologues are ok but nothing to cheer about.
2,"I would call this spice ""Light Essence of Jerk Seasoning""","I had only used the bottled, paste type Jerk seasonings before and always like their deep aroma and the bite of the Scotch Bonnet peppers that give the spice its heat. I ordered this anticipating at least a similar flavor and was quite disappointed.As soon as it arrived I poured a bit out into my palm and gave it a taste...nothing! No kick and not much of anything but a slightly salty/allspice flavor. There is the slightest hint of the familiar Jerk aroma and that is all.If you DON'T like bold flavors and hot peppers then this might be a way to introduce yourself to Jerk seasoning. If you are expecting something bold you will be unhappy."
5,this is the baddest cd out there all the jams,i cant believe they grab all my favorite old school jams and whipped them into one great package thank you.... if your having a party grab this bad boy all the songs i used to chill to as a little girl together in a package deal not one song on these cds is bad its worth the money
2,mango gravy,I bought this product on a whim because I love trying new things and this one sounded good.It looks like gravy though and I can not use it after reading the ingredients. It is for over chicken and I just can not bring myself to put it over my chicken. It just does not look good.
4,One of the finer soul compilations,"This CD is great! Ok, I could have done without ""I Gotcha"", ""If loving you..."" and especially ""Ben"", but the rest are classics. The sound quality is great and all of the songs are full lenght. (Rhino keeps getting better about this as time goes on).I'd probably own the entire series if I didn't have most of the songs on other soul compilations!"
2,poor lining,The lining of the hamper is heavy cardboard. If damp clothing is put in I do not believe it will hold up.
3,A great selection of Jethro Tull tunes,"OK, I will admit it, I do fall in the category of casual fan of Jethro Tull. I don't have every one of their albums, but only a couple. Thankfully, one of the albums is The Very Best of Jethro Tull.This album has a great selection of Jethro Tull tunes, including The Whistler, Bungle In The Jungle, Thick As A Brick and Minstrel In The Gallery. Jethro Tull has an interestingly different sound that keeps their old tunes ever new. Why did I give this album five stars? Because I do indeed love it, and do not hesitate to recommend it!"
4,"Altogether, Pretty Good, Though Lacking Somewhat","I first saw this collection on the shelves of a K-mart, and I had a couple of extra bucks, so I bought it. A tried and true Jethro Tull fan will say that it is missing some essential stuff, (Teacher, Cross Eyed Mary, etc.) and the edited versions of some of the songs killed it altogether. But, I say, for a one-disc collection, it isn't bad at all. It has no songs from Benefit, and Thick as a Brick was numbed from 45 minutes, to almost three! That was one of the weak points of this. Other than that, it has all of the essentials, like Aqualung, Locomotive Breath, Minstrel in the Gallery, Bungle in the Jungle, and others. All of the albums, excluding Passion Play and Benefit are represented fairly. If it were to be complete, it would need to have multiple discs, so, conditions permitting, fairly good. Me, I am waiting for the box set to come out, if it does. Hopefully, it will."
2,Introductory Only,"This is a good collection of good Tull tunes, but not all-inclusive. Most disappointing for me is how chopped-down some of the tracks are (though there's not much other option with ""Thick as a Brick""). Instead, I might recommend the newer live release Living With the Past. (I have the DVD.)"
3,Halfway decent Tull compilation,Any greatest hits album with the remastering of hit songs is going to be fairly decent. I would have to rate this as an OK mix of 20 Tull songs. Favorites like New Day Yesterday and Aqualung still shine incandescently. There were however many notable excellent tunes missing. There was really nothing from the great Tull album Benefit and where was Cross Eyed Mary from the Aqualung album? There actually were a few clunkers included. The selection of tunes was dubious at best.
3,Great music; pitiful remastering job.,"The tune stack for this new Tull compilation effectively traces the unique prog-folk sound of Ian Anderson & company from their late sixties blues rock roots up through more modern productions such as ""Steel Monkey"" and ""Roots to Branches"". The only problem is the remastering: The application of digital noise reduction in the remastering process has sucked all of the warmth and vitality out of the music leaving us with a very cold and brittle sounding product. It would have been much better to just let the master tapes roll; hiss and all. I'll give this collection an ""5"" for content, but a ""1"" for sound. Tull fans should seek out DCC's ""Original Masters"" gold cd instead."
2,Classic Tunes ---- Terrible Remastering!!!,I (...) love Tull but loathe the remastering of this collection. This is another case of de-hissing sucking the life out of the music. (...)Have a listen to recent re-master's by Simon and Garfunkel or Pink Floyd to hear how spectacular older recording's can sound when re-mastered properly!!!
3,This Could Have Been Better!!!,"I have been a fan of JT for many years. This very best collection was missing some of the songs that I expected to be on here. Songs such as Cross-Eyed Mary, and Skating Away should have been included. Some of these ""very best"" songs I have never even heard. Oh, well at least Aqualung and Bungle In The Jungle are here. This could have been better...the editing and the quality of the CD isn't the best...But, it's still Jethro Tull."
5,Very Best Of Tull - Revised!,"I have just about everything Jethro Tull has ever done and I got this album, well ... just because. But I really like the way it plays, especially the shortened versions of ""Too Old To Rock'n'Roll.."" and ""Heavy Horses."" In the liner notes, Ian Anderson says something to the effect that on some songs in the past he got a bit carried away, thus the lengthy versions of the above mentioned songs were produced. I much prefer these shortened versions.If you enjoy Jethro Tull then buy this album. You will enjoy it! I certainly have.P.S. To Zanegang who asked if this CD has the extended version of ""Bouree?"" No! You're thinking of the version that's on ""A Little Light Music"" by Tull released in 1992, where David Pegg plays bass and then Ian performs a fast and furious flute solo."
3,Not quite best of,"Jethro Tull has had so many best of's that by now you'd hope that they would have a definitive single disc collection. This collection is too broad and does not present the tracks in any order. Narrowing the scope to '68-78', in chronological order, I have come up with my own track listing:1. Song for Jeffrey2. Living in the Past3. Sweet Dream4. Teacher5. Witches Promise6. Aqualung7. Locomotive Breath8. Cross-Eyed Mary9. Thick as a Brick (edit)10. Life's a Long Song11. Bungle in the Jungle12. Skating Away...13. Minstrel in the Gallery14. Too Old to Rock and Roll...15. Songs from the Wood16. Heavy Horses"
3,Great songs...too much repetition,"If this represents a contractual obligation to Chrysalis, then it truly lives up to that qualification. With the exception of ""Roots to Branches,"" there is nothing here not already packaged on another Tull anthology, and frankly, the constant recycling of the same old tracks gets tedious after awhile...and I'm a Jethro Tull fan, if you're wondering.This is a decent place for the Tull newbie to start, although the Anniversary Collection comes more highly recommended, as it goes into more detail with the early albums and presents the very best later tracks over two discs. Buy this only for your friends who are afraid to dig much deeper than this into the Tull archives."
3,Missing songs,"This album is missing a few songs. The very best of? Not quite. Where is ""Teacher Lyrics"" and ""Hymn 43""? NOw I have to get those songs elsewhere."
5,Just my opinion!,"If you ever heard Jethro Tulls Auqualung, and enjoyed the musical tallents in that song, you should buy The Very Best of Jethro Tull; it certainly has the best of his music you'll find, all on one CD"
4,What a Tull order this is,"Its got the more familiar tunes on it, but missing a couple of his better hits. Overall, a good collection."
3,"Not a ""Very Best"" compilation at all, but...","If you are not very well acquainted with British Folk-Prog music, but you just want to get a bunch of the most ""Radio-ed"" versions of Jethro Tull, this CD is for you. But if you want something extra, go to the double-CD ""The Very Best"" (import) by EMI International. It may be a bit expensive in relation to this one, but you'll find more of good Tull music that you expect."
4,"Good, but what happened to thick as a brick","this is a good compilation, and for the average person it is worth the money, but for those of you, like myself, treat ""Thick as a Brick"" as a devout christian would treat a bible this CD will be a little dissapointing. The song fades out and not all of it is heard. But if your religion isn't Jethro Tulls Church of Wisdom and you just enjoy listening to Jethro Tull, this is a CD worth at least a second look. ...And then she ate the pie!"
5,Very Best of Jethro Tull,"It is great as any other J.Tull works. The compilation is fantastic. The digitally remastered sound is perfect and gives us a great idea ""who is who "" in Rock music."
4,Quick and fairly easy to use,"Works pretty well, and certainly better than thinning or texturizing scissors. I have short but very thick hair, and a lot of it, with layers all over the place. With this razor cutter I can thin it out and layer it myself pretty fast. The only trade-off is that I sacrifice comfort for speed: with a razor, there is some pulling of the hair involved during the cutting. If you are doing it yourself, it's hard to avoid tugging on the scalp.I do like that this cutter is set up for replaceable razor blades. Although it doesn't come with spare blades, it looks like I will be able to replace the one in this when it gets dull."
2,"Well Intended, but Weak","This may hold some appeal for die hard running fans, since the passages about and in reference to the sport are the best written and most interesting in the book. However, this apparently self-published novel is as short on originality as it is heavy on a plethora of pop culture references and hokey, contrived dialogue.While the author is obviously a devoted and passionate runner himself, there is little here to keep a reader involved in the short, soap operatic chapters. It could also have benefitted from better editing, containing numerous punctuation errors and misspellings."
2,Far Too Cliche,"As an avid runner I am very excited for any work of fiction that discusses the runner's experience. However Maurer tries far too hard to match John L. Parker's gift for designing witty dialogue, and ends up creating character interactions that are far from believable. Add to this the main character's cliche obsession with Steve Prefontaine, the fact that Jim Ryun is referred to as ""Jim Ryan"" and constant insufferable references to a main rival known as ""The Kid"" it is easy to see why this work was (as someone already noted) apparently self-published.In sum, the story is actually fairly interesting and not a difficult read, though I would never pay more than seven or eight dollars for a copy because the money would be better spent on OAR or Again to Carthage."
4,Small Gardens - but by American Standards!,"This is a wonderful book - and useful too, since it contains garden plans for each garden featured. Living in the Netherlands, we found that the definition of ""small"" according to this book does not apply to some of the really (!) small gardens here. Yet, we can adapt the plans, adopt just a few of the design solutions, or consider the sometimes unusual materials applied. Definitely worthwhile, if only for the beautiful photography."
1,Disappointing Garden Design Book,"I was truly disappointed in this garden book. I was not inspired or intrigued by any of the gardens shown. I do admit that the book may appeal to someone with a very small urban courtyard and a preference for the avant garde style garden. The gardens were mostly minimalist with emphasis on huge graphic shapes imbedded in the lawn or piles of crushed glass layed out in pyramids. Really, an ""aluminum garden""?? If there is no plant life, isn't it really just a patio and not a garden? The photography was less than stellar, with several photos out of focus. The two to three page spreads per design usually just had photographs of the same object from three different angles. I do not recommend this book for anyone who enjoys gardening with plants, discovering new plant varieties, or are looking for inspirations for plant combinations. The hardscape designs weren't very interesting either."
3,Story of a dedicated nurse,"""I'm a nurse, not a woman. I've resolved never to marry, never to have a child. I'm a good nurse. I'll stay one. I'm not going to be a woman."" Could she turn love down?The story concerns a nurse, Kristine Grant, who is engaged to one man but loves another, while dedicating her life to the service of others. ."
3,Blunt edge,"I hate to be a party pooper, but I was disappointed with this novel. It was readable enough, but I was never fully engaged and I found the modern-day muckraking journalist subplot unconvincing and unecessary--almost as if John Lanchester had been persuaded to include it as a way to make the book appeal to readers who might mistake a reporter named Dawn Stone for Danielle Steele.The descriptions of Hong Kong are very fine, though, and Tom Stewart is an interesting, if disaffected, character. There's some nice stuff in ""Fragrant Harbor"", but for a truly exciting and wrenching book about Hong Kong, I would recommend Martin Booth's ""Hiroshima Joe."""
1,The WORST novel about Hong Kong,"I don't know much about Mr. Lanchester's background, but it's clear that he DID live in Hong Kong and he CANNOT tell a story. There are weighty issues in the book that he simply refuses to face, such as, as far as the readers could tell, the main character has one single sexual experience - why? If it's because of his love for Maria, Lanchester keeps it a secret from his readers. And there is the child between Stewart and the nun would have to be a bi-racial child and he would have to suffer a certain amount of discrimination in rural China. But Lanchester didn't even bother to touch upon at all. All the major events in Hong Kong and China are glazed over. And Please Please tell me what's the point of tagging a short story about a flighty British woman in the beginning? The novel reads like a first draft - sloppy, careless and uneven."
1,lousy,"Having lived in Hong Kong for almost 10 years I looked forward reading FH. Unfortunately, the book is terrible both in terms of characterization and atmosphere. Not to mention a series of inaccuracies."
3,A treatment of the classical theory of Elliptic Functions,"Let me start by saying that this book really is not worth the hefty price tag. I'm not sure why it's so expensive.Elliptic Functions is a pretty cool subject. I got into this out of interest in elliptic curves and modular forms. However, the connection to those subjects is not very apparent in this book. Chandrasekharan's book seems to focus on the early development of this theory (I'd guess from the late-1800's to early 20th century). Focus is primarily on analytic foundations and connections to Analytic Number Theory.No exercizes are included.For more on Elliptic Functions in the context of modern mathematics, check out the book by Serge Lang."
4,Great movie,"This is a great movie I love it ,the story line gives you something serious to think about. don't tamper with things that you shouldn't scientists are always pushing the envelope thankfully this is only fictional who would want something like a shark to be able to think !"
5,nice,came new and in great conditions. and it worked perfectly with the blue ray dvd.great movie. my mom loves it
4,Good Book with Nice Pictures!,"Good book that is easy to read with some good descriptions of shorebirds. Very easy to follow and understand...Gives some indepth info but not too much. Pictures are very good, showing some various views of different species. Only thing that would have made this book better would have been range maps that are not included, still a good book and worth the purchase price."
4,"Very Interesting, but very predictable","This book was pretty good, but as I said it is very predictable. The ending is expected because there is alot of suspicion towards the person who ends up being involved in the conspiracy. It's interesting how these innocent-like kids end up in a very tangled up situation! I would definitely rate this 8 out of 10. I would definitely recommend this book indeed! ~Chloe"
5,a very good mystery and scary too,"this book has been one of my favorite RL Stine books for a while. The book shows that you think you can trust someone but in the end you dont know who to turn to. This book also has good character development, you will feel like your right next to the characters the whole time and going through the same things that they are. i recomend this book to anyone who likes a good scary mystery"
4,Read it over a weekend...,"This book was REALLY suspenseful. I especially liked when they were trying to escape, and it was scary when they saw the guy staring at them from outsideThe ending was a bit confusiing though [i still don't really get it]*sparkle*"
1,Non-classic Classical Hymns,"When I saw the title of this CD, I mistakenly assumed it would be classical hymns presented in a--well, classical fashion. Instead it was a collection of contemporary artists' arrangements, which I found less than satisfactory."
4,Great Songs in Fresh Arrangements,"Some of the best CCM artists of the 1990s are collected in this CD of traditional hymns, lovingly updated. The one original song is John Gunden's Hymn of Grace, sung by Tami Gunden, which got a lot of airplay in the early 90s and is worth the rest of the CD all by itself."
1,The Humor at First Glance isn't True,"When I first spotted this sticker while looking through what was offered at Amazon, I was initially caught off guard by how cleaver this one was, and this Republican was impressed. But the more I thought about it, the more I wasn't.See, the story of Moses freeing the Jews from Egypt (from the Bible) does start when a burning bush tells him to go. God is using it to get his attention. And once Moses finally goes, God uses him to lead the Israelis out of Egypt and straight to the border of the land they were supposed to go to. When they got there, they panic at the people they'd have to drive out of the land, and that's when the problems started. God was so unhappy with their lack of faith, He then made them wander in the desert for 40 years. This was at least a year after the burning bush.While initially cleaver, this just doesn't hold up to any thought. No matter which side of the election you're on this year, there are better ways to express your opinions."
4,Well done,"This video is enjoyable to watch. The angles of the camera could be better, more helpful but Abby is great to watch/listen to. Her knowledge and skill are obvious and helpful."
2,Ultimately not clear,"When you have that sleeveless black top or dress that you love to wear you dread the accumulation of white deodorant schmear in the armpit area. I purchased Dove Ultimate Clear hoping against all hopes that it would be the ticket to ending the non-stop armpit check. Alas, it is not all I had hoped for. it's not even close. I think it might have slightly reduced the amount of deodorant dander left, but by no means is it undetectible or clear. The search continues....."
4,Mind blowing shine,I heard good things about Collinite. I didn't see the clear coat polish I was looking for but tried doublecoat. Word of warning its very very hard to buff off by hand but the resulting wax coat is really thick and shiny. It resists washing off and seems durable.
5,This Book literally saved my live.,I want to thank Dr. Weil for writing such an amazing book. I was recently diagnosed withchronic Hepatitis C and I was terrified when the doctors told me that the only treatment available was Interferon and it only works in 10-15% of the patients. I have no symptoms of any illness and with the help of Dr. Weil's Book I am determined to keep myself healthy for a long time to come .This book has inspired me so much that I am buying it as presents for my friends and relatives.With all my heart thank you so much Dr. Andrew Weil.I'm already reading some of your other treasures. Sincerely Beatrix M
1,Seems strained and inauthentic,"I have a hard time taking this guy at face value. His ego and self-centeredness just scream off the pages. Most of the information is second hand, and not terribly compelling. There are a lot of great new books on health these days. I cannot say that I can honestly recommend this one. Sorry."
2,Havn't read it yet,The ONLY thing that totally spoils the purchase of this item is the relentless volume of related Dr. Weil emails I receive.... I spend so much time deleting this junk from my computer that I dont have time to read the book.. How do I STOP this insanity??????? Cam Boynton.
5,Enlightening and Practical,"Great book. Found the rationale to be sensible and based on common sense information. Loved the 8 week program. Am trying it now and find it is working for me very well. Overall, learned a lot about alternative medicine and how to take a different view of illness."
4,some interesting ideas....,"that may seem far-fetched, but are definitely worth considering . . . especially given all the case studies that support the fact that traditional medicine often does not work . . . i'm going to change my life completely, as a result of reading this book, but i will make some changes."
4,"A Nice Collection, Not Great But...","If you are a fan of the music found on the Tommy Boy Label from 1981 to 1996 then this compilation will have you walking down ""Memory Lane""... A number of tracks on Volume 2 make it a nice addition to any Hip Hop collection but odds are if you are a fan then you probably have most of the tracks in this collection already.I think Tommy Boy would have done us a better service if their ""Greatest Beats"" were just Beats and Instrumentals to the songs.One nice thing about this collection is the ""Mixman"" software included on the CD."
3,Great in its day,"This was truly one of the classic books on exploratory factor analysis. However, the big problem is that the literature has moved on while (for obvious reasons) Harman has been frozen in place since its publication, which means that it is nearly forty years out of date. The literature made a substantial turn towards confirmatory factor analysis right as this was coming out. While EFA wasn't a hot topic anymore, there are developments of importance (e.g., geomin rotation, more focus on standard errors, the comprehensive review done by Cudeck and Browne in the 1990s, semi-confirmatory/semi-exploratory factor analysis, multiway/multimode models, models for non-normal data, etc.) that came after this book was published. Unless you want the best the 1960s had to offer and nothing else, a book like Stanley Mulaik's Foundations of Factor Analysis, Second Edition (2009, CRC Press), is likely to be more suitable."
1,Out of Sync,"I believe that bigger is not necessarily better. I was hoping to find good solutions and ideas (modernist or traditional is not an issue) to help bring a bungalow into the 21st century. The main problem with the book is that it seems 15-20 years out of date. For example, the bathroom square footage and storage areas in the plans are not generous (but this is ok for vacation or second homes). In this respect, the plans in the home have a lot in common with bungalows from the 1920s! The book does not give examples of forward thinking design for the year 2000."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"Has a bunch of more or less conventional designs, for small houses. I was looking for completely new designs -- ""tiny house designs"". Check out [...], there's a great pic of a tiny (mobile) house."
1,Disappointing,"Save your money. With few exceptions, the designs found in this book are not pleasing to the eye -- and there's just no way around it, some are downright hideous. This reviewer admits to a bias against modernistic design, which the editors seem to favor."
1,A Waste of Money,This is the worst home design book that I have ever seen! The vast majority of these designs are unattractive and unworkable. I was greatly disappointed. Spend your money on a full-service architect instead. A full-service residential architect will be better able to design a small home for your particular lot and will monitor the builders and sub-contractors for you too.
1,Recycle Bin Canidate,"Don't waste your money on this book. Most of these homes look like miniature prisons. Unattractive, cold, and bland. My copy went into the recycle bin. Atleast it'll do some good there."
1,Not worth the paper it was printed on.,If you want a book with better house plans just go to your local grocery store and buy any of the plan books there. It should only cost you a few bucks and you will find hundreds of better ideas than this book contains.
3,"Please, let Earl rest in peace.","Earl Swagger is dead. His death is described in one of Hunter's earlier, and much, much better books. Please, Stephen, let the poor guy rest with dignity.I am a big fan of Stephen Hunter's previous books. This one is definitely the worst in his impressive run, starting with ""Dirty White Boys."" The author really needs to find some fresh characters and stories, and not continue to rehash the same old.The book flowed well, but the main character seemed very uncomfortable in his own skin. Definitely not the Earl Swagger of the previous books, but a twisted carricature of himself, constantly wondering what the hell he was doing in that novel. Uncharacteristically of Hunter, the supporting characters are quite weak and undeveloped. Castro himself is portrayed as a babbling megalomaniac idiot, which, whatever you may think of him, is certainly not the case.Overall, the book was a dissapointment."
2,Comic book sans pictures,"Silly and sophomoric ""guy"" writing; needs to study John D. McDonald or even Donald Hamilton to see how it's supposed to be done.No character development, absurd plotting, cardboard hero and cheesy action. Give it a rest. There are so many superior books and authors who do this sort of thing. It gets a star for the jacket design alone."
1,Doesn't anyone edit Hunter's books?,"I deeply regret spending $26 on such a trite story. All the raw material was there--Swagger, the Russians, the CIA, Castro, Havana--but, this time, Hunter didn't have the interest or energy to meld it into a real novel. Havana is a comic book."
5,Good Book,"An enjoyable read. I wish you could figure which books came in what order a little easier, but it was a very good read."
1,This is what I think!,"This book is not even literature unless you are a NRA freak! I was expecting an historical novel with regards to the political situation in Cuba during the early 1950's as it related to CIA involvement and activities in the country. Instead, it was a preposterious shootout with improbable situations involving a bunch of sadistic gun slingers and torturers. I can't imagine the author sitting in front of the word processer trying to figure out the most bloody and disgusting murder and torture scenes possible. And then we're treated to pages of gun descripitions and operations - it reads like the old Field and Stream magazine. I'm interested in good literature and not junk like this. The author has a long way to go to publish an historical novel as distinctive as ""The Quiet American"". Save your money for Field and Stream!"
2,Trying to hard,"I've been reading Hunter for years and this is the first time I've been disappointed by one of his books. There's just to much cute about the characters and what they say and do. I especially found Short and Speshnev to be below his usual standards. As a film critic Hunter should know better then to write about ""B Movie"" characters. Most appalling was his portrayal of Meyer Lansky. Meyer was a gangster, not some oneswise old granddad. (Note to SH.. Lansky would never call anyone a ""schmata"" a rag, he'd call him a ""gonif"" which is a crook.)It was a poor end for a great series."
4,Havana,"This novel is set in the early 1950's When Cuba was being overthrown by the Castro regeime. It is hard-hitting and riveting, with the main character being both rough and tough, but with a concience. I first learned of this book in a magazine article describing the main character's personal weapon of choice - the legendary 1911 Colt Automatic chambered in .38 Super."
3,Not His Best,"While this book is worth the read it is not as good as his other works. It starts well and ends well but the middle really lags. If you want a good Hunter book read ""Point of Impact""."
1,"No ""swagger"" in this one","I knew better than to buy a book when you know how it ends.We know Earl can not kill Casto, so what's the point?This book limps along with plenty of filler to get us in the mood for Havana when Castro was getting weened.Since the end of the plot is a given it is difficult to turn the pages.I have read every Hunter book and enjoyed them. Save your $$ on this one."
3,"Kolchank's Gold, by Brian Garfield",I read this novel many years ago and enjoyed it then. Now finding it again on my Kindle I couldn't wait to get it. Again I found it a very intreging well thought-out story.
2,5htp capsules,"appears to be weak,assume it takes long to work, will give it a chance, nothing more to report, 5htp l00 capsules"
3,Food for thought,"I'm still half-way through but this is an intetersting book. If you want to see Mickey in person, you should head to his web cam disputes site: [bloggingheads.tv]"
3,"Utopian Vision, Creepy Dude.","Kaus' book outlines some truths about capitalism that even die-hard conservatives would have trouble dismissing. The importance of money in American society is increasingly apparent yet we refuse to level the playing field. While Kaus' perceptions are astute, his remedies are utopic to the point of being a bit naive. A guarantee of jobs for all typically creates inefficiencies in the workforce as jobs are assigned not because they are needed but because they are required in order to fulfill a worker's right to work. All in all not a bad work for a creepy dude who makes mixed cd's and mails them out to any half-way attractive girl that he meets."
3,A little disappointing...,"I had high hopes for this album based on the fact that the singer is Liv Kristine Krull's sister, and the advertised ""Nordic folk metal"" theme. Well, the singer is ok but not as experienced and talented as Liv Kristine. And as for the songs being about Nordic folklore - trolls and fairies and such, they aren't. Just typical heavy metal.So those are the things I was disappointed in, but there are some good things about this band as well. The artwork is exceptional. And the music is in fact very listenable.The best thing Midnattsol has going for itself as a band, in my opinion, is potential. Even if ""Where Twilight Dwells"" isn't all that great, the band shows a lot of future promise."
4,still got improvements,"don't get me wrong this band is good but they could be a lot better than this album again i say this is a band with the talent just haven't found there true cords yet. most likely there second or third album they will get the credit they deserve. this album is worth buying, so get decide for your self"
1,This book is one big let down...caveat emptor!,"The author claims this work to be a ""mammoth undertaking..."" which will ""bring you closer to the heart of the controversy..."". Bunk. This is a rehash of the more conspiracy-laden facets of the UFO phenomenon (Area 51, Roswell, MJ-12, abductions, Face on Mars, etc), presenting long discredited ""facts"" as some sort of revelation. The author promises ""recently declassified documents"" and ""rare photographs"". What we get are reprints of the MJ-12 papers, photos we've all seen since childhood (including a ""mysterious photo"" of an alien which has long since been identified as a wax model from a Canadian museum). There is more filler in here than in a hot dog, such as page after page describing the events in the 'Alien Autopsy'film and lots of quotes from TLC's UFO specials.There is not one original thought in this book. A real waste of time"
2,O.K.,"The previous review is about right on. What can you say about the same mj12, blue book, grudge, condon, and many other names for the same uninteresting and hardly reputable organizations within our government that hide ufos from us? the book is really well written and could lead anybody is not a true ufo buff right down the path. hell i even found myself looking twice at the alien video stuff. but in the end i found the book really entertaining but not educational..and the pictures suck...really they do...i have seen them all ....correction i had seen all those pictures by the time i had read my second ufo book in 5th grade (i'm 21 now) but like i said the book makes for a great fantasy."
5,"Great book, I dont care what the others say","This well written, fact filled book was very intersesting and amazing. It has a lot of convincing information,quotes, pictures, and lots more. The other reviews may be bad, but trust me--this book is not one to miss. I love reading it. Its great!"
1,Very untraditional girl in ultra-traditional society gets away with everything,"The book was well-written, for the most part, but i was repulsed by the portray of a society which punishes thievery with death, but placidly stands by when watching a man beating the living lights out of a woman, ""his"" woman. It is true that children love parents that abuse them, women refuse to leave the men that abuse them, but i just couldn't see any redeeming qualities on the Samburu. I know the author tried to portray them in a favorable light, but there are some things where no compromise is acceptable.This would be a fabulous novel for a book club, because it can be so controversial."
3,Useful but with Limitations,A useful tool for getting off the main roads but limited in that it does not distinguish between almost impassable dirt backroads and passable paved and or dirt roads. Better than nothing but should not be used as a stand-alone atlas. Have additional county and/or topo maps as references for serious backroad exploration.
2,New style is hard to read and use,"The Michigan Atlas & Gazetteer that I just received is a new redesigned style, and it is too busy to read, and minor roads-- the very reason that I bought this-- are not labeled clearly. Up to this point, I have always been happy with the gazetteers, we have several, and rely on them when on vacation to go places that are not on other maps. I will try to locate a used one that is in the ""old"" format, and that I have been very happy with."
4,Gazetteer - I use it all the time when motorcycling,"I always have a gazetteer in my saddlebags for whatever state I'm traveling in. I guess I'm old fashioned and like to use maps rather than the GPS. However don't put 100% faith in these maps as ther are mistakes on the maps, but I've used them for years and have discovered many out of the way places and always feel confident that I will find my way to wherever I'm headed. I've also used them as a guide off road- they have a lot of information in them - just don't be surprized if you find a mistake here and there. The overall accuracy is good and reliable."
1,offensively inaccurate,shockingly bad. rife with inaccuracies and flat out misinformation (even in cases of recent history like the North Hollywood shootout). terrible writing. really... i'm at a loss...
2,Disappointing after seeing the first Conan movie,"I watched this immediately after seeing Conan the Barbarian. I was really disappointed. After being pleasantly surprised by the quality of the first movie, I was looking forward to seeing this. I was really disappointed. The FX used in this movie are much inferior to the first, which is surprising since it was made 2 years later. The great scenery of the first movie was mostly replaced by cheaply made constructed sets that looked incredibly fake. This whole movie kind of had a ""Flash Gordon"" cheesiness quality to it. This is actually what I expected from the first movie and was surprised to the upside. I may not have been as disappointed in this movie had I not watched the first one immediately before it. The falloff in quality was hard to ignore."
4,Great glasses,This does a really good job of dimming the glare of the computer. I just would like for the frame not to be as flimsy and the lens can get quite smudgy easily. But for the price I'll take it!
4,Great,"Should have bought these a long time ago. Didn't really think these would work, but I was pleasantly surprised. Well worth the money."
4,Works,"I have found these glasses to work as advertised. As a graphic designer, I spend most of my day in front of a monitor. When I wear them at work, I end the day with less eye strain from glare than before. Worth the price."
3,OK,"These glasses are okay. I have not heard about computer glasses before, so I think there should be more advertising in order to raise awareness of this type of glasses."
2,Not Helpful for Me,These ar not really helpful for me because of my eyes. It is not the glasses. I am going to have some eye surgery and hopefully read comfortably again with glasses.
1,Do Not Read This Book.,"I am not one who reads the classics and relishes the writing style, the genre of the book, or the story content. For a first time novel, this book was merely an exercise is period writing. For relevancy to 'Alice In Wonderland', this was not a story that I made sure was part of my boys childhood. In today's culture, I found it very hard to see any literary merit!!!!!!! The subject of petophylia has risen to a new level in the author's interpretation of Lewis Carroll's childhood. I found the book repulsive, disgusting, and a waste of my time."
1,Outdated in every way,"This book claims to be a sensational new look at 'Carroll and Alice'. Actually it's just a warmed-over serving of old old news. Worse than this - it is totally out of date. All the 'facts' that Ms Roiphe bases her novel on were totally debunked two years ago in Karoline Leach's book 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'.It's ironic that beneath all this fake 'revelation' and fake 'mystery' in Roiphe's book there is a REAL mystery in Carroll's life that Leach revealed and which would make a great piece of novelisation.If you want to read piece of silly pseudo-history buy this book. But if you want to read a great story - which has the advantage of being totally factual - then read Leach's book. It's better written, more exciting and wil tell you a lot more about Lewis Carroll"
1,the realty is more mysterious than this fiction,"I've read this book and I've read Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild', which isn't fiction. Even so, Leach's portrait of Dodgson is more moving and more mysterious than this nonsense of Roiphe's."
1,Just silly,"It's not 'well-written'. It's not 'based on real historical events', and it most certainly tells us nothing about the real Lewis Carroll.If you would like to know about the much more interesting reality that this silly cotton-candy book obscures then buy a good biography or go to a good website like Looking for Lewis Carroll (www.lookingforlewiscarroll.com).But DON'T imagine you can read this and be reading history.It's intellectual junk food for the terminally dumb."
1,Junky and cheap,"Just as the other review stated, if you are looking for solid brass (or even bronze) shop elsewhere. These piush plates are actually made of very thin aluminum and very easy to bend out of shape. The antique brass finish looks nothing like antique brass but rather brushed brass.If you are looking for solid brass, go to Lowes where you can get solid brass (unfortunately you have to get the shiny, polished brass, though) for literally half the cost of these cheap push plates here at amazon.The only good thing about them is uf you have to drill holes in them like I did, they are much easier to drill than solid brass, but they are very cheap and will not last. I would also advise against using these on the outside of a door.Poor, poor, quality."
1,Maybe antique bronze but certainly not antique brass,I purchased the push plate with the color selected as antique brass. The coloration of the product when ordered looked perfect however the item received is almost black not the copper/champagne color expected. Couldn't use it.
5,Growing Through Tragedy,"BEYOND ONE'S OWN by Gabriel Constans, PhD is composed of l4 true interviews with individuals who have suffered great losses in their lives. These interviews, with a brief introduction by Dr. Constans, are told in the exact words of each of the survivors, some of whom are nationally and internationally known.Rather than being a repetitious reading of how these people have dealt with the death and grief of those whom they have loved, it is a fascinating, moving, and uplifting look at what tremendously positive things can come out of personal tragedy."
3,Bon Courage,The good news is that I finished the book -- despite this man's tedious attention to home improvement details. I'm surprised that his editors didn't edit more. The book is not on par with the other travel books I have been reading. Maybe it's a masculine type of book.
1,Sooooooo bad,I'm a huge Willem Dafoe fan so I just picked this up at a flea market. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen probably something film student made for fun.
1,Black Widow,"Probably one of the worst movies ever allowed into wide release - awkward dialogue, amateur acting, no signs of direction. Willem Defoe is cool; one wonders how he could have been part of this project. He was one of the writers. Autobiographical? Whoever's got the money has got the power. Oh, wrong movie. But anything would have been better than this one."
1,boring,I just watched My Son My Son What Have Ye Done? It wasn`t much better than The Black Widow or Anamorph. In my opinion this actor (Willem Dafoe) is really on a downward spiral and needs to salvage his career before it`s too late.
1,Only one redeeming factor.,"I watched this movie twice, thinking I must have missed something the first time. Alas no, it was as bad as I thought. Surely an actor of Dafoes caliber is capable of much better, especially in the acting department.The ONLY redeeming factor was the beautiful rendition of the song ""Domani e un Altro Giorno"" sung by Ornella Vanoni in the opening credits. I played it several times. Maybe the soundtrack would be a bigger hit."
5,CASTLE G...,"LOVE THE LYRICS...BOSTON HOLDING IT DOWN...TRYING TO MAKE IT ON THE MAP IN THIS GAME..(CELTICS,PATROITS,AND RED SOX) TO BE HEARD...RAY,E,GZUS..KEEPING IT REAL...TONY,KEV-SKI,ROME,DEF JEFF MISS THEM TOO...OLD SCHOOL...LOVE WHERE YAH STARTED AND WHERE YAH AT...THIS CD IS LIVE...AND HANGMEN3...KEEPING IT BOSTON MASS."
4,very enjoyable and informative,"The first 100 pages or so basically tries to answer the question of how a 'free' country could permit slavery. After that the book describes the plight of what these days are called (inaccurately) 'special interest groups' and how they fit into the broader context of american history.The book excels on many levels and is readable for a non scholar such as myself. It informs in a well written, accessible tone. The passage of time is done so smoothly you barely notice the changing eras. This device emphasizes the theme of freedom and is very effective. The author remains objective (aside from the descriptions of the Reagan era) throughout the story and has obviouly researched his subject thoroughly. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good and thought provoking american history read."
2,Not that great,"This is a bore to read, unless you're really, really into the stuff. His analysis is good, and well-organized, but he could use a more objective tone rather than analyze everything with a 1990s PC-liberal bent. (My obligatory disclosure is that I'm only halfway through the book.)"
4,black foil,"just what the description says it is. i bought them to wrap hard candies,but the mold i bough, come to find out, makes little candies so these are def better for truffles and whatnot. guess you could always cut them"
2,"Completes the receiver only, NOT the rifle!","Although I found the DVD a worthwhile instructional aid on finishing the KTO Sales AR-style modular receiver, the title is misleading: It stops with a completed, stripped, ""in the white"" lower - NOT A COMPLETE RIFLE.You will need at least one other video to learn how the lower's internals go together, and if it doesn't show about coatings - like a Brownell's or Duracoat - then you'll need another video for that too.I don't mind buying another DVD or three about the AR family (AGI!), and I'd have given ""Four Stars"" for the video's clear explanations and unintimidating style, BUT THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER TWO EMAILS ABOUT THE ISSUE (I gave them a month before posting this review) ON THE MISLEADING TITLE, so the DIYguns video gets two stars.The KTO modular lower is WELL WORTH IT! And the included DIYguns video does help, I just want them to change the dang title to ""Completing the Receiver"" - or something!"
2,Maybe it was user error...,Our tree lost its leaves and died not long after we purchased it. This could be due to user error or our geographical location (NE PA) but we have other plants and they are fine. It was very cute though while we had it!
3,Nice wireless keyless entry system,"I purchased one years ago and still utilize the unit. The only problem is that after time, the keys do not necessarily work the first time you press them but still much nicer then to have to either go to a car and grab a remote entry or go into the house to press the button. Easy to program"
2,Wrong Model,"I was told that this was the right model for my garage door but, when it arrived I had to call customer service only to be told that my system was so old, estimates ran from 1993 - 1975! - that no opener would be a match.The upside? Craftsman must have produced a superior product because my door opens without fail, even after all these years. I do hope to get a refund though and initial correct information would have prevented this hassle."
5,Works flawlessly with 1994 vintage Chamberlain garage door opener,Works flawlessly with 1994 vintage Chamberlain garage door openerThis keypad works great with my old Chamberlain garage door opener that was installed by the builder in 1994. Other universal remotes / keypads did not work nearly as well. Very easy to program or reset when the code gets compromised.
5,Nice transaction! Thank you!,Nice transaction! Thank you!Good delivery time.The book was in the same shape as mentioned.
1,this is not the shirt received,my husband ordered this jersey and received a plain generic reebok jersey with a number 13 on it with warner above it on the back. theres no cardinal on it anywhere. it looked nothing like this at all. we are very disatisified. we really wanted this jersey and cant find one anywhere.
1,"Waste of $ & I have no excuse, I am in the music business.","It was recommended to me by a friend. However, when I did buy it and called my friend with my reaction he only mentioned that he had just told me to buy it based on an obscure newspaper article (by someone who liked Cohen's father.)This album is angry, it does not sound like Adam had a pleasant childhood. An angry young man, bad poetry and mish-mash music. Waste of money !"
1,Sad and lonely,"I bought this CD thinking it would be a thoughtful and interesting singer-songwriter debut, and having been forwarned by all of the critics that this was not worth the expense, I still gave it a chance. It did not measure up..does anyone know a USED CD website to trade this CD on?"
3,Worth the effort...,"I had a bit of trouble getting my hands on this record as it was never released in Australia. I ordered it from here soon after I found this out.After hearing it all a few times, I thought I'd write a review on it. I don't understand why people compare Adam to his father Leonard, when their music is completely different.This self titled album is surprisingly cool. I would consider it an infusion of Jeff Buckley and Alex Lloyd with a flair of originality.My favourite tracks are DON'T MEAN ANYTHING, QUARTERBACK, HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN.If you dig this 'straight people music' then I highly recommend it. Don't get me wrong, I still love this CD. I just wish it was easier to get over here.Technically I give it 3 and a half stars."
3,Surprisingly Good,"While the lyrics imply that he has taken on some of his fathers pain, it appears that he has all the emotions to be a great songwriter. You will find yourself searching for the words. His voice is nothing like his fathers, however it is soft and strong - very pleasant to listen to. I'd say Adam is on his way to much success."
4,Actually 4.5 stars but who's counting,"I found that, when other people listened to Adam's album, they either immediately fell in love with it or they didn't. I personally thought this album was a rollercoaster ride of raw emotion and passion. Adam has definitely come into his own here. I was intrugued with every aspect of each song. Every song contains hidden meanings and truths, if you listen carefully. These are in the broader context of the various narrations that are carried out throughout each peice. In conclusion, thumbs up from me."
2,Ho-hum sound,"If you want to start gathering Bob's complete output, this set offers you a cheap option compared to the Bear Family boxes. Soundwise there's no comparison, this JSP sounds lifeless, shrill and lacks base. So the 2 stars reflect the unpleasant sound, there are not enough stars in the universe to rate the music!"
1,Where is Spade Cooley on this???,"The box set says ""King Of Western Swing"", and that was Spade Cooley's title for decades, yet I don't see a single Spade Cooley song on here.Must have been put together by some foreigners who had absolutely no idea about the history of this music!!"
5,Good Review,These pad were exactly what I expected. They were received quickly and I had an overall good experience.
4,Enslaved forever!,"This is a great viking metal album, from the fjords of Norway comes a hard hitting and energetic album, I particulary like track nr 5 For lenge siden (A long time ago)Vocals are in norwegian but dont let that stop you from buying this album!!"
1,What real had rock/metal is!,"kids in this new world don't know what real metal is. kids are influenced by screwed up metal like hatebreed and cradel of faith. thats not real metal. real metal is metallica, slayer, anthrax. megadeth, death angel, etc. thats real metal."
1,Bad Unit. Bad Service.,"Sirius sateliete has a problem. I actually like the service and what they offer. But in terms of customer support, they are awful. Ive called day after day after day only to be told that their computers are updating and that they cannot access my account to do any maintinence.....every time they claim..its unscheduled and just an amazing fluke.I have sent them email after email..only to be told that my issue has to be resolved over the phone....its a total catch 22.my unit recently stopped working..but nobody can provide me the info to get in contact with the warranty department...because their systems are ALWAYS down.garbage unit. garbage customer service."
4,Good price - Good service,"I bought this for around $100.00 in April. I love it. The suction cup was hard to get to stick at first but once you figure it out it never comes off! I like mine so much I am buying one for my fiance for Christmas. Yes, its not the best one that you can buy, but it is reasonably priced and does its job well."
2,low price... low performance,"I bought the Starmate for $50 and a $30 rebate rom Radio Shack so I can't bitch too much....wait a minute yes I can !! The mounting bracket suction cup won't hold the unit w/o falling off. The preseting feature will not store the channels I want to set in memory. The remote included is so small it would be dangerous to use in the car. I dont think I will invest any further in satellite until the home unit antennae issue is worked out, SWMBO (she who must be obeyed) won t let me screw up the sight lines of the house...now ask me why I listen to Stern.."
5,"If you have children, you NEED this CD. Amazing, practical advice...","As a parent of four teenagers, I'm always looking for ways to keep myself ""one step ahead"" of them. I believe that I have found just that help in this CD set by Jeffrey S. Wolfsberg. I was intrigued by the title and thought I'd give it a try since my kids are at that age where alcohol and drugs are all around them. I just have to say ""WOW"" to what Jeff has to say! He certainly has the experience to back up his information having worked with students in middle and high school for the last 10 years and traveling to hundreds of schools all over the world. His message is not sugar coated and he has specific tips on how to handle a variety of situations. Let's face it, our children are bombarded with messages to drink and use drugs ALL THE TIME. What's more important than our children's lives? I highly recommend this CD set and have bought 5 sets for my family and friends."
2,Primary Source on Dog-Fighting History,"The book was originally published in 1935 as an infomercial for one man's fighting dogs with emphasis on disparaging his competitors. I read it as background for a book I am writing, and it was helpful for that purpose.The book does effectively dispel the myth that dog fighting used to be a sport of respectable gentlemen conducted at wholesome family cook outs; the first hand accounts are basements and barns, hiding from the police, with people carrying guns and using them. It was interesting to note that many of the best dogs between 1900 and 1930 were English bull terriers or Boston Terrier crosses, not pits; and that the first fight Armitage ever saw was a Colby dog that quit against a backyard mix."
2,Thirty years with Fighting dogs,I think if you read the first story; you've read the whole book. It is the same story by different fighters. Pictures are cool.
1,Inhumane,"I'd heard that Amazon sells books like this, but I had to see for myself before I placed an order on this site. Amazon, consider yourself BOYCOTTED. I will place no orders as long as books like this are sold. SHAME ON YOU!"
1,I won't do this again,"While I enjoy reading even the darker side of one of my favorite breeds, this book did nothing for me. There is so much more to be expected from these dogs but not by people like this tending to their futures."
1,I dont believe in banning books..BUT,"I dont believe in banning books, but is it really necessary to sell books about dog-fighting? Its a cruel ""sport""...i just hope they are on here for research about ending dog-fighting"
5,RLOWERY30YWFD,"BRILLIANT!!!, SOME SAY BIASED BUT THIS MAN TELLS THE TRUTH,HE OBVIOUSLY LIVED IN A DANGEROUS ERA AND PARTICIPATED IN A DANGEROUS SPORT, BUT WHAT HE RECOUNTS IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!"
1,Don't order,"what is in the picture is not what they send. got the wrong item, sent it back and they sent the same wrong item the second time. had to send back a second time and still waiting on a responce if I can get what is pictured."
3,Not good if you have skinny legs/narrow stockings,"The product works really well, IF you can get the compression stocking over the center post. My father's legs are skinny and his stockings are narrow, and it took main strength and a lot of serious effort for ME (young and in good health) to get the stocking set up to pull on. He couldn't do it at all. For someone who is heavy or who has larger legs it might work better. The idea is great and if you can get the stocking on the device it works perfectly, so its design is good. It just takes more effort to get set up than a weaker elderly person can manage."
4,Beautiful Figurine,"I love this replica of Boba Fett. The only issue with it is the gun doesn't stay in his hands very well, however I would not see this as a deterrent from purchasing it. It's clearly made for display, and the gun becomes a non-issue providing you don't move it much."
3,I don't know.,I am a Star Wars FanaticI don't know why I got this. I got this with two titanium Darth Vader's. This is made out of plain medal! Nothing Else! This toy is not highly recommended. When I told my friends about it (they all like Star Wars) they thought it was bad too!
3,"How can this be the same Hart who wrote ""Defending the Faith""?","For more than ten years now Hart has written some of the best American church history around. His scholarly biography of Machen was widely acclaimed and in some ways set the standard for its genre.But this book is so utterly foreign to that Hart writing I have come to love. Balance, and indeed charity, often seems discarded for the sake of savaging the majority views of the OPC during their many controversies. Hart not only consistently sides with the right-wing minority camps within the OPC, but he shows little respect for the majority. I gotta say -- you should proceed with humility when your view is one of a minority (right-wing camp) within a minority (OPC) within a minority (conservative Reformed folk) within a minority (confessional Christians)!The OPC has a long, interesting and, in many cases, heroic history. Despite the editorializing, much of that wonderful story shines through on these pages."
5,slip-x splash control,Perfect product. Invisible from outside shower. Clear inside shower. Great for controlling water seapage in any shower. Great product. First one lasted seven years in heavy use. Finally broke and immediately ordered another one. LOVE IT !
5,Catasauqua/North Catasauqua A Twin Borough's History,I hope this is first in a series of books highlighting what the Twin Borough's meant to the development of our country. There are so many pictures out there that tell a story. Catasauqua was once one of the richest towns in America. The sense of entrepreneurship carried over from the 1800's through the 20th century.
4,A good sampling of Welsh musics!,"This CD has a good all around sampling of traditional Welsh music, well worth getting and listening to again and again."
2,Action but not much acting,"This is an early B-western starring Ken Maynard and does not have a music soundtrack so the action stumbles in some segments. Moreover, the acting ranges from mediocre to good with the real star ironically being bad guy Captain Serge Karlov, an outlaw gang leader based in Mexico across the border from the Arizona territory.Karlov and company earn a living by robbing in the Arizona territory and in this film also murder Dan Savage's (Ken Maynard) best friend.The script is decent and there are a few twists, so the suspense holds until the end.This DVD release from Alpha is from a fair 16mm print which has approximately twelve missing frames, some dark scenes, surface noise and in some places loud audio hiss. But, all things considered it is better than many other Alpha releases and worth a dollar plus shipping. It is not worth $7.95 or even $5.00.I doubt you will want to watch this more than once and it certainly is not worth watching on a high-def screen."
5,Bryn's Favorite,My 21 month old daughter Bryn loves this book. We have had to order more than one copy because it has been 'loved' so much. I would highly recommend this book! (Don't forget to buy a second copy...you will be happy you did!)
5,Excellent Book,"I have owned this book for several years and enjoyed it very much so and agree with it 100%. The authors acurately represent the five points of Calvinism and then defend them with pages upon pages of Biblical backing.To respond to an earlier user's comments: how is this book not suppossed to reflect bias? If it reflected no bias, then the book would have no creed to mention of and would be entirely not worth reading."
4,Good and succinct,"I don't read a lot of Christian books but I think this one is worth the read. It is a very succinct summary of Calvinism. It compares and contrasts Calvinism and Arminianism, summarizes the historical facts and then spends the remainder of the time explaining each of the points while supporting them with scripture.I would take issue with the reviewer who states that this book makes its argument simply by refuting Arminianism while ignoring other non-Calvinistic views. The bulk of the book is spent supporting Calvinism with scripture, not refuting Arminianism or any other non-Calvinistic theology per se."
4,A Biblical look at the defense of Calvinism,"This little book is a must for anyone interested in knowing exactely what Calvinists believe from true Calvinists. The authors go out of their way to demonstrate their positions from a Biblical point of view, and they do so in a convincing manner."
3,the basics,"Only gives Scriptural arguments.While this is fantastically eye-opening and of course necessary before believing anything . . .I had been looking for real-life answers as to why Calvinism ""makes sense"""
1,Creates false dichotomy to support its view,"This book commits the same logical fallacy that most Calvinist books are guilty of. That the only two significant views are Calvinism and Arminianism. The truth is that a small fraction of non-Calvinists are Arminian. Thus, the book in a sense creates a straw man and then burns it down to support its contentions, hoping the reader will then assume that the alternatives to Calvinism have been eliminated. Far from the truth. It doesn't even touch on other doctrines, such as the Limited Foreknowledge view, the Middle Knowledge view, and especially not the increasingly-held Open-Theist (or Neo-Theist or Open Dispensationalist) view. I'm not a Calvinist, but I can say... there are good books on Calvinism out there. But this isn't one of them. (But I can't help but continue to be dogged by an annoying question... If Calvinism is true, does that mean that God predestined me to be a non-Calvinist?)"
2,Biased,"I must comment that this book exhibits much of the bias to be found in much of the theological writings today, particularly on the issue of Reformed Theology and Bible versions.It is lamentable that seemingly educated people apparently cannot present an issue without distorting the position of the other side(s). And it's not only lamentable, it is downright sorry, particularly in view of the fact that we are discussing the grace of God (in this instance).I long to find a resource that presents fairly and honestly the positions held by both camps supported by Scripture. May God raise up such a creature and creation.In Jesus' Name"
2,terrble recording job,"need i say more? the great bob marley sounds flat and muttered. only for the most avid completist . ""live at the roxy"" is beautiful or ""live"" or ""babylon by bus"" or ""legend live"" on dvd.but this is terrible."
2,Bittersweet,"What a shame: This awesome performance is marred by sound ""quality"" that barely matches that of a mediocre bootleg. The first few tracks sound as if the recorder was concealed in a coffee can. After that it gets better, but beware intermittent channel dropouts and muffled passages. Still, the performance itself is stunning, marked by killer versions of Natty Dread and Zion Train. If you're a serious Marley collector, it's probably worth the loot, but if you're looking for a quality portrayal of the surreal mystical event that was a Marley concert, you'd be better off with Live! or Babylon by Bus."
4,Lyricism and Reality,"The River Beyond the World is an amazing, amazing book. Peery is a lyrical writer, but there's a tough reality to what she writes. In my reading/interpretation, it ends up being a very moving novel about misunderstandings and miscommunications based on class, culture and age and how these differences shape the lives of women. The choices the central characters make alternately managed to choke me up with sadness, to make me seethe with rage and caused me to smile with admiration. Well worth the emotional upheaval and the time spent."
4,GOOD EPISODE,"THE THING ABOUT THE OUTER LIMITS IS THE WRITING. I BELIEVE IT STILL HOLDS UP TODAY EVEN IF THE SPECIAL EFFECTS DO NOT. IN THIS EPISODE ,ALIENS ARE TRAINING GIFTED CHILDREN TO TURN AGAINST MAN AND HELP THEM INVADE EARTH. THESE STORIES ARE REMARKABLY FRESH EVEN TODAY. AS WITH MOST SERIES THE WRITING ALWAYS LEADS TO GREATNESS. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THIS EPISODE VERY GOOD UNLESS YOU ARE HUNG UP ON GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS. BUT BY 60's STANDARD THE EFFECTS ARE GOOD. THE OUTER LIMITS ASKS YOU TO IMAGINE THINGS AS YOU WATCH. WHICH IN MY BOOK MAKES IT VERY GOOD."
3,NYC n the 80's whats not to love,"I completely dug this movie because its NYC in the very early 80's. Not the best quality but I am more interested in content. I just fell in love with Jean-Michel's voice and his wandering around the city. We can only see gritty downtown New York in films like this now which sucks. I love looking back at how it was and the creativity that was bred in that era far surpasses anything to date.You would never see a film like this made today, everything has to be so glossy and contrived and done for money instead of art... Its so unfortunate!I don't own this movie but want it. Anyone wanna gift it to me? I'd love to have it. :)"
4,Downtown 81 Must See Art Movie,"Downtown 81 is a must see for those who enjoy learning about art or just love Basquiat. It's less than 2 hours and is a little funky. If you don't like experimental art movies, you probably won't like it. Well done!"
3,Fabulous for Kid Creole Scenes,"This is an OK movie if you like Warhol films &/or Warhol film wannabes. You get to see a snapshot of a lively time & place: Mudd Club (ala Max's Kansas City) & ""downtown art"" scene. The problem is that by this time it was all too obvious that all the art scene was about was self-promotion & some camera time (yawn...as they used to say in the funny papers). Still there's some fabulous unforgettable music here, especially Kid Creole & Coati Mundi & The Coconuts & that nutty great Japanese group The Plastics. You could erase the rest of the film & leave them & I'd give it 5 stars!"
2,It was Ok i think,pretty raw outlook in the life of BasquiatI'm an avid fan so i have no regrets having this.
4,Unusual and Entertaining,"This movie is totally not what I expected, and I am very glad it is not! It is a funny story with good screen shots of Jean-Michel and his co-stars. Not a documentary but a movie worth watching again and again. You will be pleased."
5,ANOTHER BELL RINGER FOR HEATHER !,"ANYBODY, WHO REALLY LIKES ""GOOD HONKY TONK MUSIC"" WILL ENJOY THIS ALBUM. THERE ARE TWO TRACKS THAT REALLY STANDOUT AMONG THE REST-"" BROKEN HEART FOR SALE AND PLAYIN EVERY HONKY TONK IN TOWN"". THESE TWO SELECTIONS WILL MAKE THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK!"
3,"She's good,but.........","With all the five star reviews,it looks like the entire extended family chimed in,so! I ain't gonna say anything derogatory just in case you all come lookin' for me,if you get my drift ? I think this lady has enormous talent,and given the time she will be one of the greats. She still has a way to go,and I believe she will wind up with a huge name in the business."
5,Worth reading,I found this as a great book. This book shows what happens if you play with fire. You could die because of it. The ending was pretty cool and it is related to the edition I have reviewed(the one with the girl staring at the fire). I hope you read this because this book is a pageturner.
5,This book was...,terrific! I enjoyed reading this book and I also enjoyed the plot as well. It's an idea that has never been used before i think. The ending sort of confused me.
5,You could get burned,"Jill, Andrea, Diane and three boys they hang out with set fires because of Gabe, who convinces them to set fires. One of their fires end in murder and their fun game ends and the terror begins. Jill must find the murderer before her life goes up in flames."
1,I have read much better.,I really like R.L. Stine but this was one of the worst books I've ever read. For one thing I really didn't like the characters [Especially Andrea]. They just seemed real snobby.For another thing the plot was kind of hard to understand. Maybe some poeple would like it but I didn't.
5,SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!,One of the best Fear Street books EVER!!!!!!!!!Rellay Scary AND EXCITING!!!!I don't see why everyone Hates This book so MUCH!!!!!!!I LOVED it!!!!!!I was HOOKED by page 1!!!Really Excellent book and defintely a Pageturrner!!!!!!!Highly recomended!!!!!
4,A suspenseful and exciting read!,"The setting is set in a town where all sorts of weird stuff happen at Fear Street. The characters are Gabe, Diana, Andrea, Jill, Nick, and Mike. Gabe just moved here from a big city. He's an old friend of Diana's. The whole group really helps Gabe to feel welcome at Shadyside. The plot is that Gabe starts a game with fire, and Mike and Nick really get in to it. Gabe challenges them to start fires in the boys' bathroom at school and at an abandoned house. Then it starts getting out of hand.I think this book was kind of weird and dumb at the same time. Some of the parts were drawn on for a long time and it gets boring. R.L. Stine writes really good books, and they are suspenseful too. I've read better books by him. The Fire Game is a good book to keep you occupied."
2,"THIS SET NOW SUPERCEDED BY A NEW 2007, 3CD BOX FOR LESS $$'S","In 2007, a new three-disc import compilation,Chuck Berry: The Ultimate Collection, was released. The audio on the Ultimate discs is virtually identical to that of the 2000 Anthology 2CD set, and the 2004 Chess remasters; it's very good.While Ultimate has six more total tracks, there are many songs that don't appear on both sets (most notably, the two famous Christmas hits, sorely missing on Anthology):Anthology-only tracks:Guitar BoogieDo You Love MeI Got To Find My BabyDon't You Lie To MeConfessin' The BluesI Want To Be Your DriverUltimate-only tracks:Merry Christmas BabyRun Rudolph RunAnthony BoyMad LadRoute 66Go Go GoGo Bobby SoxerLittle MarieThings I Used To DoLonely School DaysIt Wasn't MeClub Nitty GrittyAt this writing, the ""used & new"" price for the Ultimate 3CD set is actually lower than the Anthology set. So, with the inclusion of the two Christmas essentials, it's definitely the better deal."
4,Really complete collection,This album is the most complete Chuck Berry record I have. It includes some tunes I never heard. The songs are originals so they are not in stereo.
5,5 stars for each disc equals a perfect 10!,It comes down to this...if you read the songs on these two discs and recognize classic after classic...you are drooling and need this wonderfully paced and sonically sensational set. IF you read the song lists and don't recognize the songs (and claim to like rock n roll) you REALLY NEED to order this collection to hear where it all came from...lest you think the Rolling Stones invented this stuff! ..but don't be worried that this is some kind of egghead history lesson..this stuff STILL rocks and is perfect music for crusin around these hot summer nights...play it loud HAIL HAIL ROCK N ROLL...and Chuck Berry!
2,Great until the ending,"The idea is good and the twists in the plot are really interesting and unusual but the ending is ridiculous. I couldn't believe that Anita did not call the police, I won't spoil it for everyone but just say that the choices she made did not seem realistic for a mother in her situation."
2,I did not like this one. Audiobook,"The narrator was fine.The book was slow, boring and predictable.I didn't really care what happened.I really wanted to like it, the premise had potential, it just didn't meet the mark."
1,Trite & predictable,"I got the audio tape based on the reviews of other readers, but could not listen through the whole tape. Once Timmy disappeared, things became so melodramatic I had to start skipping sections. A bit over the top, with writing aimed at jerking the reader's heart strings."
1,"Been there, done that.","This book was only worthy of one star because I do not wish to glamorize my life.Basically this novel was an undocumentary documentary of my life, except I never recieved any royalities and I've never been to New York, hence the stench of B.S. in the aire.The first time I read this book grudgingly because I needed something to read while I ate breakfast; I never put it down.Currently my novel is in a drastic state of much needed repair because it's scattered in 3 seperate pieces, and the cover? I have no idea, because I've read it so much.I need another one, but this book is definitely a first as in first rate! I'll never again get that sense of awe but the memory and feeling of displacement will always be there."
2,Sent wrong product,Would have been a 5 star if I had received the nails that I ordered. I ordered clipped head nails. I received full head.
2,My Reaction to it,"I was so excited to get the King Rising levitation DVD.When it came in mail,I ran straight to my room to start learning the trick.But when I was watching it,I realized that I wasted $13.00 on the DVD. :(They showed how to do the ""levitation"" but it's not what I expected.I was so disappointed that I'm going to be 'hated' at school.I was gonna show the trick to my friends,but now I can't.If you're a parent & you're wanting to get this for your child...DON'T.I wasted 13.00 & now you MIGHT too...I really would prefer the Criss Angel levitation DVD.MUCH more 'realistic'."
2,hmmm,to be honest i was expecting more but this is just garbage the method sucks i would go out and by criss angels self levitation thats probably the best one out or skywalker levitation
1,Joke Book,The book is a joke. The levitation ellusion is ridiculous and may work if you are on a stage with lots of props to draw their attention away from what you are doing.
3,Book for School,"The book is okay. The exercises in the back are a bit annoying with the made-up abbreviations. It takes me a minute to figure out what the respondent is talking about. It's one thing to use shorthand when you're actually in the room with the person describing the blots, it's another when you're not. I would've preferred to read respondent answers without the abbreviations, and then have a section discussing the importance of using shorthand in order to quickly write down the responses."
1,"Terrible, Horrible, (idiotic?) people that edited this book.","Just a quick note to the grad students or whoever was unfortunate enough to have to edit this garbage. Could you have perhaps tried filling out the book just once after your shoddy job putting it together? After filling out the first half of the book, I have FOUR WRITTEN PAGES OF ERRORS. How anyone supposed to learn anything about organic nomenclature from this half-a**ed attempt at a workbook is beyond me when you have to spend a significant time wondering whether you or the book is incorrect. Mr. (Dr? I hope not) Traynham, make sure it gets done right or take your name off of it. Peace."
1,Buy this if you want to unlearn organic nomenclature,"This book is horrible, it's full of errors. If you use this book you will probably become worse at organic nomenclature due to the fact that it gives many blatantly wrong answers."
2,New editors needed!,"This book is full of errors and poorly written material. I have ordered the other paperback book on Organic chemistry nomenclature by Hellwinkel, ""Systematic Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry: A Directory to Comprehension and Application of its Basic Principles"" and will post my review once I have read it.Let us give credit where credit is due for the book by James G. Traynham:Pearson Education of Prentice HallEditor-in-chief, Science: Nicole FolchetteSenior Editor: Andrew GilfillanAssociate Editor: Jennifer Hard"
2,Many Errors,"I ordered this book as a requirement for a class. However, we ended up using the 5th edition because the newer 6th edition had way too many error (ex: 6 on a page) and almost every page had errors. Maybe this edition would be good for someone who already knows how to do nomenclature and just wants extra practice problems."
1,This is the wrong battery,I have ordered this product twice and both times have received a battery that is incompatible with my camera. It says it is BN-V306U but the battery that is in the box is not correct.
4,Interesting and adventures I like this book alot.,This book is good in that it's fast paced and funny Linsha is an adventuerus not so rule book morals as some characters you read about these days. Linsha works hard and isn't perfect so she's easier to understand than charecters that always do whats right. If your perfect frankly-you're boring.
1,Title says it all!,"How can you state that because Kansas is voting Republican something is wrong? As you see, the author has a horn to blow from the get-go. Kansans don't need anyone to tell us how to think -- when the law in this county is considering outlawing the word ""God"" in schools that are paid for by my tax dollars, there's plenty wrong with the people who are okay with this idea -- mostly Democrats.Maybe Kansans are simply Christians first and are voting their hearts. Think about it.Sign Me: Angry at the People who are trying to steal the heart of my country and the heart of my children."
4,A worthwhile read for our times.,"This is a very entertaining polemic detailing how conservatives get elected through appealing to emotional cultural issues (e.g. abortion, prayer in the public square), yet once in office, spend most of their time increasing the economic gap between classes in America (e.g. tax cuts for the wealthy, union busting, cutting benefits & government economic programs). His home state of Kansas is used as the primary set of examples.Progressives are still left with having to come up with their own strategies for fixing this problem. He offers none. The gist of the book is covered in the forward and in the afterward. The rest is detail."
4,Thomas Frank is FROM Kansas,"I don't know if that should matter, but I was getting sick of reading negative reviews that describe the author as an arrogant elitist Blue stater who thinks he knows better than the locals what's best for Kansas. The dude is from Kansas.And I don't see anything arrogant about saying that people aren't voting in their best interests. Most voters (myself included) are just getting a fraction of the information we would need to be informed, and we get bombarded by spin at election time. A huge chunk of the votes cast have got to be based on sound bites, spin, candidates' height or likeability, or just following the herd... this goes for liberals and conservatives alike (unless they're watching Fox News, in which case they're statistically more likely to have the facts wrong, and more sure of themselves).Also, if you're going to just cut and paste a two-page long rant by some blowhard pundit with a bag full of 50 cent words, don't."
5,All You Need To Know About Today's Political World,"Frank gets to the heart of the matter quickly--America is veering(dangerously) to the Right because the mostly-white working class has chosen to vote against its own economic interests. To paraphrase the author, the mob is angry, breaking into the palaces of the wealthy in order to....lower taxes. Although some chapters get close to repeating this idea unneccessarily, you'll find the book an overall excellant reading experience.Pay close attention to: Frank's description of the 1991 ""Summer of Mercy,"" which had the effect of eliminating the Democratic Party and moderate Republicans from the political process, his description of various Kansas locales and the effects neoliberal economics have had on them, and the lose-lose process by which cities end up ""bidding"" against each other for the benefits of attracting corporate jobs only to be ""stiffed"" when said corporation finds a better deal elsewhere(often overseas)."
3,Thomas Frank is not Tom Frank,"S. Hatfield in his ""review"" below titled ""straight from the pages of the New Republic"" confuses Thomas Frank with the New Republic's Tom Frank. The two are not the same.Since I have not read Thomas Frank's book, I have given it a neutral rating of three stars. I felt it was important to correct Hatfield's error."
4,"Why do democrats loose? Terri Schiavo, that's why.","It doesn't have anything to do with the economy. Republican excesses in the field of perks for the rich pale in comparison to the culture of death to which the Democrats have been, unfortunately, appealing. Look at the abortion on demand-- even late term and partial birth. Look at the euthanasia. Look at the Terri Schiavo case. Why are they supporting a husband alone making such descisions? Where are the real feminists?Democrats are looking for the social, cultural oil they put on the slippery slope this country is falling down. If they would stop that, they would win on economic issues."
1,Author didn't know why farmers vote Republican?,"The first page lost my interest when the author states he didn't understand why poor farmers almost always voted Republican. I'm not a Republican, but it seemed pretty obvious to me as they are obviously invested in the free market enterprise to make money, thus Republicans believe more in limited government and lower taxes in the economy. It makes sense, left and right, that one who is in business would vote Republican."
4,An insiders view,"I really enjoyed this book. The author laid out a convincing argument about how the neo-con movement has taken over the state government in Kansas while the Democratic party was asleep at the wheel.The history of politics in Kansas described in the book was interesting, especially as the author is a native Kansan and brought his personal life experience to the narrative.I recommend this book, especially to those Americans who don't understand how the citizens of Kansas consistently vote against their own material and economic welfare."
4,"Perhaps a diatribe, but...","...I suppose if ""hard-working"" conservatives had worked HARDER in school, they would know why Germany had its National Socialists, which any red-blooded German-American from Kansas might remember before ""casting the first stone."" Signed, a red-blooded German-American from Pratt, Kansas, last name Schmidt. As for modern ""Christian"" values as espoused by the far-""right:"" If you're told what to think, you don't have to think. Christ THOUGHT, and FELT; was he not made man? Perhaps we should be more Christ-like. And I LOVE Kansas because the horizon is flat as a plate, where the weather, stars, and the birds, bugs, and churchbells are all wonderful to behold, appropriately enough."
1,don't waste your money,"Do not buy this book. I came prepared to love it, I was really looking forward to an insightful, informed, inside view of this remarkable political 180 of our times. That is simply not this book. It may be well researched, but it is so poorly written that it is nearly impossible to find out. Negative, back-biting, harsh, judgemental, bad-mouthing, blame-the-other-guy psuedo ""politics"" IF you can call it ""policits"". Politically themed finger pointing is more like it."
1,Nothing is the matter with Kansas,"The problem with your reviews is the people are not from Kansas. The reason that Kansas is Republican, has to do with values. Most Kansas residents do not like the liberal doctrine, which has become more and more radical, not to mention socialistic views in a capitalistic country. We have strayed so far from what this country was founded on, but the people of Kansas still believe in God, Country and Family."
3,What's the Matter with the Democratic Party,"I grew up on a farm in Western Kansas 11 miles from the schoolhouse auctioned on ebay that Frank speaks of. Currently, I split my time between Greenwood County, KS, populated by blue-collar Republicans, and the campus of Utah State University, which, surprisingly, is rife with DLC"
1,lies,"to the IL idiot, Kansas is poor, it manufactures almost all the nations aircraft, and is home to the 4th richest county in the United States. IL doesn't even make the list. (Johnson county in the Kansas City area) dummy! and so is anyone who buys this book"
2,A sequel,"An interesting book...one that is understood from one side of the aisle, but needs an interpretor fron the other side of the aisle. I won't say which is which as I believe it's a good book for backgroung opinions, regardless of which you are...left or right.However there are many liberties taken with the truth, a fact that the knowledgeable reader must find out for themselves. Unlike Fahrenhite 911, that had so many ""over the top"" info that posed as facts, this one has enough to make the reading a little more interesting.This book begs for a sequel...What's the Matter with California?A state that votes for Socialism."
1,Smoke and mirrors,"Mr. Frank and the plethora of similar authors, politicians and pundits searching for an answer to ""WHY?"" fail to look in the mirror. Frank continues the long-practiced Democratic tactic of slamming the ""rich"" and ""corporate"" types who ""run the Republican party"" from their limos. Fact of the matter is that Frank and the proponderance of Dems making these complaints have directly benefited immensely (i.e., have made tons of bucks) from exactly the free market economic practices they complain about. The smoke they're blowing simply distorts the reality that America is the most desirable destination for anyone seeking a better life. If Mr. Frank and the others don't appreciate what they see through their rose colored glasses, they are welcome to emmigrate to, say, France."
1,Ridiculous,"How ironic that a north-eastern snob writes a book telling Kansans that yes, they are good-hearted people but apparently they don't have enough sense to vote and make a decision for themselves so Mr. Northeast is going to swoop in and save the day. Oh, it brings a tear to the eye."
3,Good background,"I wanted to learn why Kansas became such a conservative state and why religion has dominated the state. This book gave much information about why the turnaround. So, if you are interested, this would be a good read. Donated the book to m local library upon completion."
5,Yep. I love it.,"The Midwest was once reliably left of center. The Grange (a kind of union) opposed big corporations (represented by railroads). Farmers wanted college educations for their sons (and, sometimes, daughters). What went wrong?Kansas was apparently sold down the river - actually bought - by corporations and psychological warfare.The book is a bit dated because conservatives have 'shot their wad' and nobody (well fewer) are buying the myths of the far right (e.g. trickle-down economics). What, the people have no bread? Let them eat cake!Bread and circus, or corn chips and right-wing radio, have limitations. People start to see the carbs and clowns for what they are!"
4,Whats the Matter with Kansas?,His opinion expressed in his book actually offers a reasoned opnion on why the Republican party has gotten so focused on such fringe cultural concerns instead of watching their pocket books and doing whats right for everyone instead of the top 1% or big business's lobby.
1,A question the liberal elites can not answer,"Frank as well as the liberal elites, just don't get it. That is why they are asking this question. Liberal elites are constantly mocking and discriminating against middle America. I am proud to be from middle America. There is no mystery as to why we vote Republican. We have not been tricked to vote Republican, we vote for candidates that have values, morals, love of our country and respect for each other; from life to death. There is more to life than how much money you have, the car you have or house you own. We are not impressed with wealth and power. These are the things that the elitist will never get. Kansas is beautiful, the people are relaxed, educated and extremely friendly. There is simply nothing wrong with Kansas. Instead, it should be a model for both the east and west coasts."
4,"A wake-up call, ignored.","I have a connection of sorts with Thomas Frank, tenuous though it is. When ""What's the Matter with Kansas"" was making the rounds as an important book, I was living in Kansas, and watching the media and local responses. I saw what he was writing about, the home of free soil populism being sold a bill of goods by the right. There's one county in Kansas that by economic rights should be a Republican leaning area, home of gates communities and Fortune 500 businesses. There are a hundred other counties that should reject the Republican project and look left, but the right was effective at melding the economic interests of big businesses with the moral majority; now Kansas is more known for Fred Phelps and Operation Rescue than it is for John Brown. He tells that story well, and deeply."
2,Not Very Insightful,"Frank is a brilliant guy and a good writer. That's why this book is a little hard to take. It's very superficial and seems like it was written not as a deep analysis of heartland America, but more as a way to let the elites feel that they are morally superior...they're just getting out-huslted by a bunch of redneck snake-oil salesmen.He could have done a much more thoughful look at why blue-collar America has abandoned the party of Roosevelt/Kennedy/et al.For a much more balanced look at the American electorate, I'd recommend 'The Right Nation' by two Britons, Micklewait and Woolridge.."
5,a must read for conservatives,"If only every middle-american republican would read this book... If I had to pick, say, 10 books to give to a republican to try to change his or her mind, this one would probably be on that list."
2,More opinion than research,Disappointing that author was so biased rather than careful research to explain driving factors. Filled with bias.Frequently refers to local Kansanians columnists with bias when introducing
2,Understands the Reps but not the Dems,"I won't argue for a minute that Frank doesn't understand the Reps completely. His problem however is that he doesn't understand the Dems at all. That the Reps are bad for many Americans is virtually a given. That the Dems are as bad or worse is what Frank does not get. The economic policies of the Dems, not to mention their social policies, are a disaster for all Americans. Communism does not work as an economic tool and that's essentially what modern Democrats are peddling. Never forget that NAFTA, which has sucked more jobs out of the US than any other single piece of legislation, was a bipartisan effort."
2,What's the matter with the Democratic Party?,"Midwesterners, and southerns especially, reject the left wing agenda of the Democratic party on moral issues which they do not consider trivial, as does Frank, but central to what has made America strong. They will not consider a Democratic candidate, or any candidate, that does not hold to their values, nor the economic policies of someone they do not trust. Whether this is benefit or ill is a matter of endless debate by economists, but this situation won't change until the Democratic party nominates a more centrist candidate.I gave the book two stars because the issue is important and he has done a service by challenging us to think about what is happening to our country that is changing rapidly."
3,Not especially enlightening,"I'm a liberal, but I found this book unenlightening. It was kind of rambling and unfocused. It wasn't humorous either as indicated by the LA Times review. Mediocre. I wish it was better."
1,"After paying, never received it!!!!!!","I'm very disappointed! After paying for it to be sent from a seller in the marketplace (bordee books), I have not received it and the seller is (in my opinion) giving me a hard time about getting me a copy of it. Their solution was to ""wait and see if it comes. Get back to us in a week or so."" If it was possible, I would give ZERO stars! Think twice about using this seller!"
1,"It must be the people who are stupid, not our platforms or beliefs","""A healthy, well-educated child will grow up empowered and less likely to want or need that AK-47...""Wow, John Kerry is posting on here now! Only stupid people want or need guns. Just like the military !!! Way to go, John. Make sure that those of a lesser class understand their place and standing in your ""progressive"" society ...You guys just don't get it. The social issues ARE what's important."
3,its ok,If you read the first 2 chapters you do not need to read the whole book to understand the basic premise.
1,"""Tilt""","Initially I had a great deal of difficulty in reading this book. However, after I placed my 2500 page Websters New Universal Unabridged Dictionary under the right side of the cushion of my favorate chair and then sat down in the chair the forced tilt to the left made the book more understandable."
1,Independant,"I'm an independant Kansan. Middle of the road. People in the heartland don't appreciate a 'poll watcher' politician. They want someone who will stick to what they believe. Therefore, they overwhelmingly vote Republican. There you go. No need to read this book."
1,Wrong on many counts!,"The author assumes that the policies he believes in are valid without needing to substantiate his beliefs. The Kansas people just realize that free markets and lower taxes benefit the total American society of which they are a part. He seems to think that because some people take advantage of these freedoms and get rewarded extremely generously, then it must be bad for the rest of us. Just look at how the middle class in the US fares compared to any other society with less freedoms and it should become evident that these policies benefit the working class not detract from it. Well written but just not well thought out."
3,Soap Box Reviews Again,"Most reviewers of political books seem to forget to review the book outside of their own politics. It seems ridiculous that all of you are either bashing the writer for his opinions or praising him for them. The important thing for open minded people is if he has stated his argument well and written a good book. I think he has, although not a great book. His argument seems accurate As for all the pro-this or that folks who jump into the fray here on Amazon I'll save my arguments for a more meaningful and valid forum than trying to get people to not read a book by posting a review. So to all you republicans in kansas, read this book with an open mind."
4,Explains much of the 2004 election.,"I read this book because I always wondered why so many of the working poor would vote against their own economic interest. Had I taken this book to heart, I wouldn't have been so surprised and disappointed in this last election!After the election, I posted a paragraph expressing my digust on my personal website. Then, someone surfed in and signed my guest book. The ""author"" of this guest book entry could have been taken STRAIGHT FROM THE PAGES OF THIS BOOK! Interesting!I was told: ""God-haters, hollywood, criminals, uneducated, baby-killers, pseudo-intellectuals (like you), liars, immoral, welfare recipients, homosexuals, felons, and uninformed college children...those are the votes democrats count on.""To see what goes on in the ""mind"" of such a person, read this book!"
3,Typical Liberal Railing,"When are you guys going to get it? I realize that hypocracy is so ingrained in the liberal mindset that you can't believe that the rest of us might actually value some things more than the almighty dollar that seems to serve as your surrogate diety.It's really very simple Tom--until the Left get's on the right side(pun intended)of the social issues (abortion, gay marriage, acknowledging the role of Judeo-Christian belief as an ingrained part of our country's foundation and principles.....etc...you know the rest)--you will never win the heart and soul of the real America. There is no conundrum here, only your refusal to look beyond the self interest that dominates your decaying ideology."
1,Mr. Frank totally misses the mark,"Because Mr. Frank cannot possibly understand how people think in Kansas (or Mississippi, where I am from), he doesn't understand how badly his book misses the mark. Economic issues don't matter as much to folks in ""fly over country"". We've never had lots of money, and we don't expect to. So the idea of voting Democrat because of economic policies really doesn't appeal to us. What does matter to us is values. Money and jobs may come and go, but our Christian values are always with us. We will never support a party that supports, among other things: homosexual marriage, removing ""under God"" from the pledge of allegiance, abortion, abortion in the 9th month of pregnancy (partial birth), and federal funds for obscene art. Lets not forget the millions that the Democrats raise each year from the pornography industry. Mr. Frank misses the mark. It's about values, not economics. Now I have a question: What's wrong with Massachusetts?"
1,What's wrong with people who don't think like me...,"This is nothing but What's wrong with Red State people who disagree with liberalism. He tries to point out that people in Kansas suffer with Republican policies. But he doesn't bother to mention how Kansas has a significantly lower than average unemployment rate, high home ownership rates, and has had solid economic growth. This is another liberal who thinks he knows what's better for the people of Kansas than the people themselves."
3,Unmet expectations,"I don't think Frank answers his fundamental question. The book was an interesting personal assessment of Kansas culture and mentality, similar to much of the Midwest, and Frank gives a good overview of the puzzling paradox of a declining middle and working class voting increasingly for conservative Republicans who make decisions against their economic interest. He observes that the majority of Red State voters don't seem to be concerned about political decisions that politicians make but only about lightening rod, cultural decisions (e.g. abortion, gays).OK, but I expected more insightful analysis of the political culture of the US. Why have Democrats drifted so centrally to be indistinguishable from Republicans? Why is there a lack of deliberative democracy leaving delegated politicians to represent us?"
5,What's the matter with Kansas,"This book should be required reading in high school. To be able to understand the basis for where this country is now and how we got here is necessary to making informed decisions about the two party system of government.I highly recommend this book, but it's not good bedtime reading if you're a Dem like me. It makes for some frustrating enlightenment about how the R's do business..and hence not soothing for sleep!"
3,"Frank gets it right, kind of.","Frank's critique of the over-blown culture wars, nurtured to camouflage an oppressive economic agenda, is spot-on. Its an effective and well-documented political polemic. But his alternative to the Republicans he calls ""The Cons"" doesn't ring accurately with the history of mid-America progressivism either. The Populist Movements that Frank idealizes were rent by internal contradictions every bit as preposterous as the government-loathing cons who are terrified that antiquated bans on sodomy are being struck down by the government. In the case of the populists, the contradiction was that you could protect family farms and get family farmers to accept more than token responsibility for each other's well being.To better understand the complicated political dynamics of America's rural context I would recommend Catherine McNicol Stock's ""Rural Radicals: Righteous Rage in the American Grain"" and David Danbom's ""Born In the Country: A History of Rural America:."
5,Great Book,"He hits the nail on the head with his view of the great conservative lie. More folks, particularly conservative folks, should read this and wake up!"
3,Couldn't wait to read this one...,"In the days following the 2004 election, questions about how the Democrats or ""blue staters"" lost flew. I kept hearing Thomas Frank's book cited, so I decided to check it out.Frank takes an interesting approach to his theories by juxaposing them against the history of his native Kansas. While this approach intrigued me initially, it was a bit boring at times. Sometimes, this juggling act was too much of a stretch for the author to tie together.This book does a good job delving in to the mindset of many of those who feel the Democratic party has left them behind. I especially recommend this book to any so-called ""blue stater"" who finds themselves scratching their heads over those ""NASCAR-loving red staters"".Frank does make some good points here, but has a hard time tying everything together."
2,Not particularly useful...,"The problem with this book is that Frank, in typical liberal fashion, fails to realize the priority of religious beliefs and morality held by many conservatives. Frank cannot fathom that there are people who believe preventing abortion is more important than making an extra few dollars each hour, or that the right to own a firearm in order for the option of self defense is more important than relying on the state for protection.Additionally, the book points out that the Republican Party's policies are less effective for the ""working man,"" and yet it curiously fails to provide any facts to support the assertion. If you want something that states more of the same fluff usually spouted by the liberals, purchase this book. If you are a conservative--like myself--looking for an enlightening view into the liberal mind (I am beginning to believe this doesn't exist), or at least into the mindset liberals have toward the conservative viewpoint, you will be sorely disappointed."
2,Light on reasoning,"This is a purely antidotal treatment of why Kansans have moved more and more to the right over the last 30 years. Frank keeps asking why Kansans would elect free-market republicans to office when Frank views this as hurting the Kansan's own financial position. Frank continually asks for more labor unions and farm subsidies as the answer to the small farmer and small town financial woes. The question is never really asked about why a small business owner or a factory worker would hold a world view that embraces capitalism and less government, which really is the question that needs to be looked at. The author simply uses microeconomic examples to justify his macroeconomic decisions."
1,Why do liberals hate normality?,"Great title-but terrible premise. The author approaches the people of Kansas as liberals always approach those they consider common people. Liberals believe anyone who does not live in New York City, Chicago or Los Angeles and who do not worship at the church of Kennedy/Clinton/Kerry/Edwards are too stupid to know what is good for them. The great unwashed can only survive in the world if liberals lead them through their lives.That is the author's whole premise - that Kansans should be indoctrinated by Ted Kennedy. That is not enough for a book."
1,Nothing Wrong With Kansas,"This book is written on the premise that there is something wrong with being conservative. There is also an assumption that Kansas is rural and blue collar. Since this is the stereotype the rest of the world has of Kansas, it sells. The fact is that the majority of population in Kansas can be found in its urban centers Kansas City, Topeka and Wichita. These are not filled with blue collar farmers. There are major corporations based in the Kansas City area alone such as H&R; Block, Sprint, Hallmark, World Span and others. The housing market in the KC suburbs is booming. Kansans are educated, white collar citizens who know what's going on in the world and happen to be conservative. I lived there and I know many people who still do.Mr. Frank has written a book of fiction."
5,THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION FULL OF LITTLE-KNOWN SONGS,"There are so many good songs on this collection that have seldom been heard, at least in recent years, it's almost kind of sad. There's everything here, from great country like ""Goodtime Charlie's Got the Blues"" and ""Loving Arms"", to funky 70's pop like ""Find Out What's Happening"" and ""If You Don't Come Back"", to great gospel songs like ""I've Got a Feeling In My Body"". More people should hear these songs! I think if RCA had, back in 1974, just released the Stax sessions as one 14 or 15 song album, instead of trying to make 3 10-song albums out of them, it would have been one of the absolute greatest albums of Elvis' career."
4,Elvis at Stax Studios,"Volume Five of ""Essential Elvis"" focuses on alternate takes from the singer's 1973 Stax sessions. ""Rhythm and Country"" includes some classic latter-day material (""Promised Land,"" ""Talk About the Good Times"" and the gospel funk of ""I Got a Feeling in My Body"") plus the occasional clunker (Leiber and Stoller's ""Three Corn Patches""). The emphasis remains on country music, with strong performances of ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues,"" ""For Ol' Times Sake"" and ""You Asked Me To."" Lively studio chatter adds a nice touch. Hopefully, RCA/BMG will release a definitive collection of Presley's Stax recordings."
5,"Smooth, Warm and Tender","A lovely compilation of songs recorded when Vic's voice was at its peak. And what a voice! Some of the numbers suffer from dated 50s arrangements (tons of shimmering violins and harps with celestial choruses), but many others are more restrained, tasteful and even jazzy. Through them all sails Damone's glorious baritone, a rich, powerful and gorgeous instrument. Especially fine are the sultry title track, the swinging ""Alright OK You Win"", a wistful ""An Affair to Remember"", and a sexy ""Close Your Eyes"". The songs were recorded at different times, with some of the earlier ones sounding a bit scratchy, but overall the sound quality is fine. The only real flaw is the non-existent documentation: in addition to zero information on the singer, none of the recording dates for any of the songs is identified. Still, if putting up with such cut corners is the price consumers must pay for access to gems like this, it's worth it."
1,rambo collection,"rambo the last of the series would not play on my dvd player, it kept freezing up, also the rambo 3 played 3/4 of the way thru and then froze up...amazon.com does not have a phone no.to call to discuss these problems with...buyer beware...."
3,Great package not for the hard of hearing,"I really like this collectors set, the dvds come in a metal box that has some really nice graphics. The extra features are also quite good and the quality of the movies is also very good. The reason I give it 3 stars is that the first 3 movies have no subtitle options I live with someone that has hearing problems and well with no subtitles we have to crank up the volume a bit so we can both enjoy the movies."
5,Rambo,"This is a great movie. Completes the saga, shows that age is not a factor but heart & pure determination prevail."
5,Great Movies on blu-ray,"This will be short and sweet. If you love the Rambo movies and you want to see them at their best, then this is the collection to buy. For me, it's not about what special features there are. It's about the MOVIE. All of them are included here and they look great. Buy it!!"
5,RAMBO RULES!,"This set is hard to find. The only set I was able to find in retail stores is the one 'without' the last movie. This is the only place I found it and just in time for Christmas (I got a pug as a gift and I named him RAMBO!) The movies are great and the presnetation is well done. I know these flix are always on TV, but it's nice to just sit and watch all the way thru without editing and interuptions. ;)"
3,Not as described!,"A lot has been said about Rambo. But this edition is published with spanish subtitles and that's not true! I'll come only with english subtitles.... so, beware of what you buy!"
5,Rambo Blu ray collection,Has all The Rambo movies in Blu ray. Great Price for such awesome movies!! For fans of action or just fans of Stallone in general.
5,Just short of the Dead Calm soundtrack original score,After first seeing Dead Calm back in 1988 I was on a mission to track down everything related to SPK. After going through industrial to new wave disco funk I finally bought this and it's amazing. One of the tracks is used in Dead Calm and the rest of the music fits in with that movie's score. I just wish someone would release Graeme's score to Dead Calm on CD (update: after nearly 20 years of hunting I have finally got my hands on this score and it does not disappoint! 9 tracks and only 32 minutes running time). In the mean time this SPK masterpiece will do. It still holds up after numerous listenings. Nice ambient / ethnic / exotic sounds.
4,loose disconnected,"The album cover is great and the music certainly is wonderful for driving away annoying persons whether they be family, Mormons or some woman in love with Steve Perry. The cover is something that belongs on every single middle aged woman's bedroom wall.The tunes are a loose hodgepodge of live and studio stuff that still manages to maintain his odd conceptual contiuity. Weasels is definitely worth picking up for any fan but probably not the place for someone to loose their Zappa cherry."
3,Weasels Ripped My Flesh,"The music on this album is very early stuff from MOI, and they tried to do a lot! Its not neccessarily ""bad"" but FZ and the MOI have done better. If you are not familliar to Zappa, this album would sound very odd to you. If you are a true Zappa fan, you would find this fascinating early music and in that case this album is a must-own!! Highlights of the album are Directly From My Heart To You, Toads Of The Short Forest, Get A little, Dwarf Nebula, Oh No, And The Orange County Lumber Truck."
4,"An FZ Must-Have, But Not For Regular Rotation","As the others say, there is a lot of jazz improv and intense experimentation going on here; that's plain enough from looking at the liner notes and the nod to Eric Dolphy and his own avant garde jazz work. If you're open-minded, you'll enjoy the jazz tracks, but they're surely not toe-tapping hits. My favorite bit(s) on this album is the three-song combo of ""My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama,"" ""Oh No,"" and ""Orange County Lumber Truck."" I only wish the jam on ""Lumber Truck"" could go on longer. Then there's the culminating ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh;"" an appropriate title for 3-odd minutes of live, fully-amplified noise. This is definitely NOT an introductory FZ recording. This one should probably come in somewhere between #15 and #25 in your acquisition scheme. It's a great one to have, but it does take some appreciation, even a little bit of work to access. Enjoy."
3,"Well, it's the Mothers, no doubt","With the typical Zappa juxtaposition of dissonance and atonality with more traditional harmony, this album will probably appear to be a garbled mess to the new listener. The contrast does not appear only from track to track, but in ""Toads of the Short Forest"" and ""Dwarf Nebula Processional March & Dwarf Nebula"" abruptly appears mid-track. More easy on the ears are tracks like ""My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mamma"", a rock tune a little too straight for the Mothers to have been included without any satiric purpose in mind (or perphaps to please wary record executives). ""Oh No"" and ""The Orange County Lumber Truck"" are tracks Zappa would revisit later in his career in both vocal and instrumental versions. It has some important moments for fans of the Mothers, but new listeners will probably be turned off by all the hooting, hollering, and feedback."
5,Just a little something...,"I remember buying this LP back in 1970. I was 12 years old, The cover art was captivating. I also remember Frank Zappa advertising Mothers of Invention albums in the back pages of the comic ooks I was reading at the time. He knew his market. This was a mind-blower. The pacing of it blew mt fragile mind. Now it's available on CD, remastered to Zappa standards of audio fidelity. An awesome collection of recordings spanning the period 1967-69, ""Weasels Ripped My Flesh"" is a Zappa experience par excellance."
4,"Great, but intensely annoying.","Weasles is one of the absolute best of FZ, filled wih incredibly loony tracks of instrumentation and jazz squiggles. However, only the vocal tracks are truly great (especially FZ's cover of Little Richard's ""Directly from my heart to you"") and the reocurring formula for the instrumental songs (Begins with great tune, ends with folling around) grows intensely annoying. Some instrumentals are great (Prelude to the Afternoon of a Sexually aroused gas mask) while some are crap (Dwarf Nebula). If you're looking for a great mothers album, this is good but get We're only in it for the money first."
1,A tape-worm hiding in the Tequila?,"I enjoy books about culture clash. This one pits the Irish and the Persians. But it is so superficial. Every character is a stereotype with no depth. The good are goodie-good and the bad are ugly and crudely vulgar. And so much backstory tossed in interrupting the plot. And then plot resolution by tossing in an almost invisible character, Cat, who turns out to be a famous philosopher in Bulgaria. Please. And nasty Tom Jr.'s quickie redemption and weight loss by the ravenous tapeworm hiding in the Jose Cuervo bottle. This foodie-lit is giving me a stomach ache."
2,Where was her editor?,"""She could feel droplets of sweat dampen her school uniform and trickle between her breasts, settling in her belly button.""(pg.91) Is this really an image I need to experience??? While there are some moments of charm in this book, the author's writing is often torture:at least one overwrought simile per page,so many attempts to make minor characters interesting that I couldn't really tell whom this story is about, and I kept hearing the soundtrack from Chocolat in the background-did we need the tinkers? The recipe gimmick has been done a million times.These are the kind of beginning writer errors my jr.high creative writing students make. I think all the 5 ratings are way too generous."
4,Captivating,"Being of Irish heritage, I wanted to read this book from an outsider perpsective. It captivated me from the get go."
5,Iran meets Ireland,I have lived in Ireland and almost always enjoy reading books set there. This one I liked alot and bought for a friend. I enjoyed the story of bringing Middle Eastern food to a small Irish town. Their (Irish) food isn't real exciting and this would be quite a departure from the norm. Its an interesting twist to a country that has had millions emmigrate to other countries. I had also read the sequel Rosewater and Soda Bread and wanted to know how they got to Ireland. So I already knew about this book before I ordered it. I would appreciate one or two sentences about the contents of books before ordering. Usually I order something I know something about - maybe saw it in a bookstore or have read the author before.
1,This book is more about service to the church than gifts.,"Hemphill elevates any person's work or service done for the church to the level of a ministry performed through his/her spiritual gift. A painter paints, a repair man fixes things, a janitor cleans not through spiritual giftedness but through ability, training, and profession. A person with the gift of service may use his abilities to assist the church, but this does not mean he has the gift of air conditioner repair, painting, or computer repair. Hemphill confuses individual service opportunities with spiritual giftedness. Hemphill does not discern between gifts and talents. Lost people may do the very same service for a church that Christians do , but they are not using spiritual gifts to do them, whether they charge the church or not. I find this book to be of little value to the Christian community."
4,Good resource for lesson plans and ideas,"Meg Garrett presents an overview of orienteering for teachers, who may be unfamiliar with the topic, to use in their classrooms. It provides lesson plans, ideas for incorporating orienteering in various subject areas, and projects to deliver a sense of 'place' to students, especially in the elementary grades. In the U.S., where orienteering is practically unheard-of, these lessons can provide different ways for students to look at their world and their physical place in it."
1,Not an Orienteering Book,"The name of this book is not named appropriately for its content.There is no discussion of a magnetic orienteering compass, its parts, or how to use one.Orienteering in this book relates to aligning a map correctly with North.Sixteenth century European mapmakers drew maps with the Orient on the top of the map. When the map was positioned in this way it was ""oriented""."
4,Latin tunes,"I love the Globe Trekker TV shows, and the music has a lot to do with that. These songs from the Latin American tours are fun to listen to, especially in the car."
5,Chesty should have gotten the medal of honor!,"If anything, Chesty was a hero but had too big a love for medals. There is no doubt of his love of country and the Marines."
4,One of the real Old School Marines,"Puller was one of the real old time Warriors that Robert E.Lee or Stonewall Jackson would of known and welcomed to their outfits. Its a pity that he is not so well known outside of the Soldiers world.This book frankly was a real surprise to me as I did not expect such a well researched and balanced book by a ""Brother"" Marine Officer. But if one wants to get past all the nonsense put out and find instead the real Man, then go no further. The other book ""Marine!"" is a lot more fun to read, but if you want the cold hard facts of a really great warrior go here instead.Altogether another example of the right man at the right place at the right time."
3,Some good parts in the book,"This is a 2001 biography of LtGen Lewis Puller (1898-1971), written by a Marine officer. It quotes lots of favorable things aboput its subject, but also indicates flaws in his views and actions to some extent. I thought the account of his time in Haiti and Nicaragua was more detailed than necessary--though Puller obviously felt it very important. The account of his time in World War Ii and Korea was often exciting, especially the well-related account of the fearsome fighting on Peleliu. I also was not impressed by Puller's fierce efforts to not be found physically unfit for further service in 1954 and 1955 less than commendable. And after retirement he had some ideas which were less than admirable, I thought. But there are good parts in the book and Marines will no doubt be admiring of the book."
3,Exhaustive research...,"This truly exhaustively researched book of one of the greatest infantry warriors of the 20th century is seriously flawed by the author's inappropriate use of jargon and cliche's. LtCol Hoffman, a well educated man, unfortunately has only reinforced the sea-story legend personna of Puller (just like Burke Davis) in his attempt to establish Puller as something more. This book is more for Marine groupies than serious Marine students of warfare."
1,Bad reasoning and bad theology,"Not only is the theology here just... wretched, the work itself is generally what is worst about these religious pseudo-intellectual works. I am a religious person, and I study religion... but this is just terrible both as ""reason"" and ""theology."""
5,The Case for Christ,"This is very well done....factual and to the point. Having so many independent testimonies add greatly to the credibility. I intend to use this in my adult SS Class. Dave Hillman, Mt.Dora, FL"
4,Worth your time!,"Why would a professing atheist write a book, or make a DVD, on the ONE man he did not believe in? Read this or watch the DVD to find this answer. It is absolutely worth the time because it means YOUR life after death!"
3,A brief visual preview of the book,"This movie is good to share with friends and family but only reveals part of what you get out of the book. If you haven't read the book, I highly recommend you get that. Much more detail in the book. Doesn't mean not to get the video. I think this video is more of a teaser for the book."
5,When Pigs Move In,"Today, I'm sure we're all looking for a deeper walk with the Lord, but fail to realize there are many things hindering us from walking the talk. This book will reveal those stumbling blocks and get them out of our way...once and for all, that we might all walk in the promises of God, as destined."
5,**Two Thumbs Up**,"Great addition to your Christian book collection. Long story short, two thumbs up! Great gift idea."
2,Wha Wha?,"Before you look at the two stars I gave and you are a christian, I personally believe jesus was who he was and that is that, but Lee Strobel does not and I mean DOES NOT give the other side a chance to state what they believe, instead he takes the ""The God who wasn't there"" approach and interviews people on the street as the opposition; then he goes to people he knows that are Christians to make christ's case. It was disappointing. It would have been better had he put people who didn't believe in christ and that were also reputable people. I hate to say it but it wasn't very good."
5,Very logical and unemotional piece,"This dvd is very well done and will help people coming from many different beliefs to see the facts and come to their own conclusions. The research is well done and having been done by someone who was seeking solely the facts keeps this unemotional. The Bible encourages believers to do their part to help and encourage others to be saved, and this is one of Lee Strobel's strong works in that effort."
5,Excellant!!!!,"This movie was outstanding, and a great way for someone that doesn't understand Jesus or needs to see proof of his existance, to experience it in the factual way. So glad I bought it!!!!"
5,Tommy Hanson Rules,"This was my first read or for that matter first exposure to Ben Elton. I was hooked in the very first paragraph, very funny and yes over the top characters. But that is what is fun about the book, a comical stereotypical handling of a very serious subject: Drugs and the possible effects of legalization of drugs. I have often re-read the exerps of the lead character Tommy Hanson the Rock Star. I am currently reading DEAD FAMOUS and will probably read STARK next. Buy HIGH SOCIETY, read it, enjoy it, good read for your next trip by airplane."
5,One of Elton's best novels,"High Societyis one of Ben Elton's best novels. It's funny, it's well written and addresses a serious issue. No - scrap that: It's very funny, it's very well written and addresses a serious issue in an intelligent and convincing manner. As a non-drug user I still had an indirect experience through a close family friend and I lost a friend from school to drugs. I find Elton's arguments to legalize drugs absolutely convincing and I second his suggestion.This should be compulsory reading for politicians."
3,Not his best but still worth a read if you are already a fan,"I always like Ben Elton's writing style and comedic take on quite serious matters. I am the polar opposite to him in political views but still can appreciate his viewpoints and funny stories.This is not his best book but an easy, funny read that raises some interesting political points whilst also ridiculing politicians and other members of British society.Give him a try as an author if you haven't already tried him, you may be pleasantly surprised.My favourite of his is Blind Faith which is his comedy take on 1984 except it is the polar opposite where everything is public. This is a good one to start with for this author especially if you have read 1984 (and who hasn't) and was laugh out loud for me."
4,The only good Ben Elton book.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and thus far, this is the only good Ben Elton book that I have read.The two other books I tried to read by Elton I never finished because they were bizarre to the point of stupidity. I just couldn't read it anymore. Anyway, these two books, Dead Famous and Past Mortem, are so ridiculous it's hard to become interested and actually relate to the characters. Therefore, these characters cannot move me in the way that good writing can move me.This is not the case with this novel. Please write a sequel to this book, Mr. Elton, otherwise, your work will likely be remembered as airport/beach junk writing rather than real literature."
2,a disappointing followup,"Sorry to say that this recording does not stand up to Gillian Welch's first work. There are only two, maybe three cuts worth buying the disk for. You'd be better off with Lucinda Williams recent CD: Car Wheels on a Gravel Road."
2,Maybe I should listen to it again late night but....,"I thought it was a bit too skeletal, made me feel like slipping into a coma. Probably good as background but not very interesting upfront. I will try it again soon."
2,Whoa There!,If you are expecting an album like Time or Revival don't buy this album. It pales in comparison to these other OUTSTANDING albums. I bought it based on the glowing reviews written here and it was quite a letdown.
3,Welch's X-Files,"Great press has greeted Gillian Welch's latest release, ""Hell Among the Yearlings"" and it's not hard to guess why. It's a very accomplished musical production by a wonderful actress portraying a WPA-era country folk artist. Tremendous packaging and ready to be consumed by a public hungry for ""something new"" - movie roll to follow by the renaissance woman! Just as John Wayne has become the foremost warrior in the mind of America, Welch bids to become our primary country folk singer. Wayne never served in WWII and Welch is from downtown L.A. but I suppose this is the process America now uses to honor the truly brave and the truly creative. If Welch's good reviews stimulate, say, an interest in Roy Acuff or The Carter Family this will all be worth it. A great practitioner she may be, but please do not dishonor the ones who created this music by calling her an innovator!donna83@hotmail.com"
4,Songs that walk around inside you...,"I've been looking for someone who sings like Gillian Welsh for awhile. Her sometimes banjo-strung lyrics make you feel you are a piece of some big Appalachian Mtn. Gillian Welsh makes a tunnel through the rural mountains of the eastern U.S. mts and brings you home, makes you think her music is your own."
4,"Who cares if she's from LA, She a great talent.",Saw her about two years ago in the NC Mountain Doc. Watson Festival and have not looked back.Never had a performer live or recorded demand my attention as much. What syncopation.
4,fresh folk/blues,Appalacian sound. Many of the songs hold up well after multiple listenings. Its great to hear a new practictioner of a classic sound.
1,never did get my shoes...,"the vendor DEFINITELY sent the wrong size and color shoe. after alot of emailing back and forth, they issued a ups return label and i sent back the wrong shoes.too bad. i really wanted those shoes.obviously, i can't give them a rating since i received nothing that i could rate."
4,Coat rack meets needs in Beauty Shop.,"I was impressed with the styling and composition of the coat rack. It was extremely economical, and that is also very important to me. We're very pleased that we purchased it, and may purchase another in the near future for our other beauty shop."
3,Fair Value @ $20-$30 -- insufficient quality to support higher price,"The highest quality items in the box appear to be the couplings joining the 3 column pieces and the hex screws [hex wrench included]. The remainder is basic sheet metal with holes in it, absent any additional hardware to ensure alignment, alleviate stripping, or level the base.At $20-$30 this is reasonable quality; however, at a $100+ list price I would have sent this back immediately.Regarding assembly, the instructions were reasonably clear (didn't immediately notice that there are two sizes of screws), and construction took less than 20 minutes.I will keep the one for the office, but won't purchase another one for home use."
1,1 inch bolts included in the box do not fit.,"I've assembled the top of this rack without any problem, but 1 inch bolts included in the package for the bottom legs are not long enough. Had to go to Lowes, Home Depot, but could not find black bolts 1.25 inches long. So I bought regular metal bolts/screws. Didn't try to assemble yet. If they fit - would need to paint them with black spray. If they won't fit - will return this cheap chinese crap back."
1,Cheap,Don't waste your money on this coat rack. The screws for the legs are too short and the metal is so bad that the screws will pull out if you almost get them in. I was only able to get one of the legs on with the original screws but I tried to get the other legs on until the screws were stripped. I ended up buying some other screws from Lowe's which is enough to make the stand come together but it's still flimsy and wobbly and I have to be very careful when I put any coats or hats on it for fear I'll break the thing. I'm sure it won't last long. Keep shopping - you'll find a better coat rack and a better deal.
3,Worth the price,"Make no mistake, this rack is cheap. It looks cheap and it feels cheap. Some of the parts bent during assembly and the bolt heads strip out if you look at them funny.But, for the price it is worth it. It holds a few coats without falling over or coming apart. If you want it for looks, forget it. If you just need a cheap coat rack then this is the one."
1,Havent been able to use it since I bought it,"Upon arrival, the screw holes were stripped out where the legs attach. I attempted to contact the seller with no response. Logically, with 2 of the 4 legas not being able to attach, I havent been able to use it at all. do not waste your money."
1,Great price.....Poor Quality,"After putting this coat rack together, the screws supplied stripped and would not hold the coat rack together rendering it pretty much useless. This purchase was pretty much a waste of money for me"
2,Buy bigger screws for the bottom,"You get what you pay for with this coat rack, it's metal that's been painted black. Like some of the other reviews here, the bottom screws aren't long enough to hold the legs together. We finally jerry-rigged ours to fit and then they came loose and the thing fell over. We bought new screws to fit into the bottom (about $2 at Home Depot).If you buy this coat rack make sure to pick up 8 machine screws that measure 1/4""-20 to replace the bottom ones it comes with."
2,browneyes,"The Coat Rack Stand Is pretty but is not realy sturdy and the hooks on it are loose and the screws that came with it does not fit well in the holes, Very disapointed."
4,quality product for the price,I am very happy with this coat tree. It looks very nice in our front entry. It was very easy to put together. I was looking for a coat tree on a tight budget that still looked nice and I found it. I think it will last a very long time.
4,Don't put this together when you are distracted. It is wonderful for clearing out your front entry.,"This is a great way to clear the space in you front entryway. That is what we call it in Minnesota. I mention Minnesota because we have extreme temps, and the coat rack gets stupid full.I really like this item, it's fully funcional and good to look at."
4,Sturdy and beautiful!,"This product was exactly what I expected. I had previewed this item in a store and the price was definitely less, even after shipping. Assembly was VERY easy and it fits great with the rest of my decor!"
2,Broke 4 day after....,"This coat rack looks nice and appears sturdy, however my dog knocked it down right after I bought it and two of the arms broke off. The metal bends and tears easily once broke. I wouldn't recommend the product to anyone who wants to pile coats on it and has big clumsy dogs or small kids like I do."
1,Poor quality,"Got this coat rack and tried to assemble it. I read the other reviews stating there are two types of screws. I made sure to separate them and use the proper screws. I got as far as attaching the legs. The legs were constantly wobbly and would not stay attached. The problem is the screws do not stay in the holes. I was able to screw them in completely, and they come out after wiggling and pulling them (no turning of the screws needed). This causes the base to be too unsturdy and I would never trust this to actually stand up with coats on it. Item was returned same day it was received. I would not recommend this product."
1,garbage,"i received this item with missing screws, contacted company they sent me the mising part which never worked. practically money in the garbage.a waste"
5,"Nice look, functional","Pretty nice-looking rack that holds a lot and has that antique look. Easy to assemble, but make sure you sort out the short screws from the longer screws before you start putting it together - they look almost the same, but if you put them in the wrong place, it will appear to be defective. But it's not!"
2,poorly Made,"I don't generally review items but in this case I feel it is important to do so in hopes of saving others time and frustration. I wasn't able to properly attach all the legs due to a combo of the parts not lining up and the screws being too short to get a strong hold. When partially put together, it wasn't able to stand without falling apart and it was crooked. It sounds like other people had no problems with it, which would suggest that it is a consistency problem with the manufacturer. I would suggest skipping this brand all together."
5,Love it!,"I ordered this coat rack after searching pretty much everywhere for one to put in our guest bedroom. I love it! The bottom is wide enough that it doesn't tip over -no matter how many coats you put on just one side. It is sturdier than I thought it would be and looks great. I have even attached a few black curtain clips to the middle ""loopy"" part and hang hats. Great find!!"
5,Was a gift,I gave this to my daughter and son-in-law. They have one of those entrances where you have stairs going up and stairs going down. It fit perfectly for them. They love it!
1,Item received unable to be assembled,When I tried to assemble the product one hole was too big for the screw & another hole was too small. I contacted the seller & they offered a full refund. The refund finally showed up on my account after almost a month of me sending constant emails to get it.
2,makes me mad !!!!!!!,it's very pretty coat rack but the screws doesn't fit at all which makes the legs falling down all the timeI don't like it.
5,Whatta rack!,"This clothing rack arrived ahead of schedule, was properly packaged, easy to assemble, looks great and was an outstanding deal! I may order another!"
3,You get what you pay for,The delivery was on time and fast. After we assembled the coat rack however we noticed that it is a little wobbly and the main center pole doesn't stand straight. It leans a little. My husband is a very handy guy and even he couldn't get it adjusted to his satisfaction. So for the price I guess that's what we get! It's a little flimsy and it's just a below -average quality coat rack. But my daughter wanted it to hang her hats and scarfs on so it's adequate for that function.
3,Meh,"I got this product in the mail today and have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I am glad that I did not pay more for it, because it is definitely worth the thirty dollars I paid and not the hundred dollars that it is apparently originally marked as. Assembly was a bit difficult, the screws are not made of a very strong material, so there was a delicate balance of tightening them to make this thing sturdy, but not too hard. It looks nice from across the room, but the quality is apparent from up close. Made in China, I hope the materials that it is made of are not hazardous to my health (i.e. lead paint), and that it doesn't fall apart in a few days. It was a cheap solution for our winter coats, and if that is what you are looking for, that is what you will get."
2,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed when my husband spent an hour trying to make the screws for the top of the coat rack work. Finally, he gave up and is going to go and try to buy longer screws and paint them black. What a hassle!! Would send it back but really wanted it for this weekend. I read where there were some negative reviews concerning the screws. Guess I was one of the unlucky ones to get a bad one."
2,Get what you pay for,"It looks very nice and is a really great design. The upper arms assemble easy. The lower arms were more of a problem than it was worth. Due to the design with the recessed threaded holes, the longer screws are not long enough. The manufacturer would do everyone a favor to lengthen them by at least 1/8 of an inch. I purchased some other screws from Home Depot and it has been very sturdy. An easy and cheap fix."
3,great,"kind of annoyed it was a gift and when it was delivered there was a picture of it right on the box, grrrrrr suprise ruined"
3,well worth the price paid,I compared many coat stands and finally decided to go with this. I should say I am happy with the purchase made. This looks exactly similar to what I saw in picture and it looks sturdy.
3,Bottoms screws are too short,It was easy to put the top part together but the bottom part did not work out.The screws are way too short.I got a partial refund from amazon.com and will buy longer ones !
4,"As good as you think, no better","This unit looks like it would hold more coats and hats than it actually does, because of how close together the stems are placed. It's still a good product though."
3,Fine for what I paid for it,It's a coat rack. What can you say about that? It is sturdy though and heavy enough not to tip over with undestributed weights. There was more assembly required then I expected.
2,"interesting films, if you get them all","Some interesting films here, especially 'Breaking the Sound Barrier' and 'Angels One Five' spread over three discs. Unfortunately, my order contained a duplicate of the second disc instead of the actual third disc.Fortunatley for me, the two movies I listed above were the ones I actually ordered this boxed set for.You are SOL trying to find those two films elsewhere, so you have no choice but to order this boxed set."
1,Never CAME!,"My subscription has not come! I ordered it in May and it is now August, nothing!This was a gift for my brother. I want to get him something else because this has not come, and I'm afraid to cancel in case they do come or I don't get refunded!!! This is so frustrating."
3,Short Comics,"My fiance likes these comics, but they are so short that he is finished reading it in 5 minutes and has to wait a month for the next one. The price is pretty high for these short comics."
4,Por que siempre tendremos nuestros superheroe preferido,"Siempre he leido historietas y te acercan a un mundo no muy diferente del real, solo que en este universo existen superheroes, siempre tienen retos por delante, desafios por enfrentar, villanos a quienes encarcelar, pues sip cada quien elige su heroe,para mi este murcielago justiciero vale la pena manternerlo leyendo mes a mes, recomendado"
3,Not as good as the Debut.,"If you were a fan of the debut album of the Tony Rich Project, then you will not be disappointed with this purchase. Birdseye brings the same soulful, jazzlike style as the original, However this album is not as ""loaded"" with great tracks as the first. The debut album was a great listen from beginning to end, although this album is good, it does have some ""skippables."" Overall 3 out of 5 if you like this genre of music."
2,Weak!,"This c.d. was o.k. It was not as not as good as ""Words"". I was kinda let down by this lattest effort. There were a couple of good songs."
5,This is going to be an award winning CD!,"I purchased this CD before hearing it because I enjoyed Tony's last CD. Well, I was not disappointed! Every song is wonderful, and although I may not know the meaning of some of the lyrics, I feel good singing along anyway. Tony's style is definitely appealing and addictive. Since I purchased this CD, I haven't played much of anything else. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Another Great Album From Tony Rich,Tony Rich has yet another great album. The first album since Words is just as good. It is a very peaceful album that is good to help one get away from the problems they face in their everyday lives. Tony Rich is in the same mold as Babyface and The Artist.
1,babyface clone on loan,he rips babyface so badly and blantly it's a pure bad joke.his songs lack any kind of originality.and is it me or what doesn't that album cover look like michael jackson's dangerous? not to mention that he also bites prince on his singing and music.his music isn't flattery it's high way robbery.one babyface is enough and the man is good. but tony rich hasn't come up with anything good except nobody knows.and that's still 2ndtier face.
2,Much prefer the old Sayers translation,"Penguin classics had mystery author Dorothy Sayers translate the Divine Comedy decades ago. She died before completing the work -- Barbara Reynolds finished it in her spirit, preserving the flow of Dante's terza rima, and with copious notes especially careful on the theological side of the work's multi-faceted significance."
1,A very poor printing and editing of the book.,"Since this is a well known novel I won't review it. You may find a review somewhere else. This edition of the book is absolutely horrible. The text is not centered as you may expect from a book, making it impossible to read. I would recommend reading the book, just not this edition."
5,Excellent Translation,"The introduction by a modern poet rambles on and is not worth reading, however the stories by Dante are excellent and have been translated without losing any of the original meaning. Notes in the back make it easy to follow this 400 year old story."
5,The Divine Comedy: Inferno; Purgatorio; Paradiso,"It's a good book, it's new and i received it in a timely manner for a really low price."
4,book reveiw,I i was happy to recieve my book i orderd quickly and was pleased with the quality of it. I i was how ever disapointed to find the package was partly opens and part of the books cover was ripped.
3,"Great translation, but poorly put together!","The reason this edition of the DC only received 3 stars from me is not because of the translation; for lack of better words, it's gold. I have to say, though, I don't enjoy reading this copy very much, because the black epoxy-like material on the front and on the side that display the name crack off and stick to my hands while I'm reading, so I always have to wash my hands after I read this. If you wouldn't mind this, then definitely buy this! This is a great translation for a great value."
3,Smooth Music,"I actually own this CD already. A co-worker heard it and wanted me to burn it for them and since I couldn't get all the songs on one CD, I just reordered the CD and gave it to them. This is good, classic R&B for anyone's collection. Check it out for yourself!!"
3,A good but not comprehensive or unified sampler.,"Despite including such giants as Marvin Gaye, Barry White, Lou Rawls, Teddy Pendergrass and Al Green, this CD is not really a comprehensive or unified sampler of the ""Smooth Grooves"" series. It contains tracks mostly from the late 1960s and early '70s (whereas the entire series goes from the 1960s through the '90s)."
5,funny/smart lyrics that stick to your brain,"i saw 1000 clowns 2 1/2 years ago.(his first gig in LA) they are so funny, and for a change of pace ""pretty liar"" is a great song kevi does with jude, and if you don't know who jude is i suggest you look into it."
3,very good cd,i thought that although there couldve been a better selection of good songs on the cd since im so obsessed with not the greatest rapper that it didnt matter to me anyway im not suggesting to anyone to buy the cd but i thought it was ok
1,I hate it!,I thought the song Not the Greatest Rapper is a stupid song! The lead singer is a fake! Maybe I say this because I hate rap or maybe because I have good taste.
1,An unending torture,I did not know ultimate pain until the day I listened to this awful CD. Buy something else.
3,Take it or leave it.,"The single (not) the greatest rapper is in my opinion the coolest song on this cd. If you're looking for a hip-hop cd or a very different kind of cd, this one's for you. If not then save your money. As I said before you can take it or leave it."
4,"OK, not great.","Always searching for greater insight into the secrets of Zen, i bought this DVD hoping for some clarification. It did not give me any. This is more of a documentary style film more than a film about giving you the true secrets of Zen. So from a documentary standpoint, it will give the novice a good idea of what Zen is. But if you know a lot of this practice and want greater insight, you won't get it here."
5,Very Well done documentary on Zen Buddhism,"What a pleasure to view a documentary on Buddhism that is concise, accurate and artful on many different levels. The word ""Zen"" has been co-opted in English to represent many things that it is not. ""The Zen Mind"" is a true depiction of the practice of Zen in modern day Japan, both by monastics, clergy and laity. A very fine film, with very fine shakuhachi (flute) music and narration. Highly recommended."
4,great documentary,I thoroughly enjoyed this. Excellent introductory video on Zazen and varying concepts of Zen Buddhism. Interesting interviews. Beautiful gardens. Some history. If there had been more info from Zen Masters I'd have given five stars.
5,ALL TIME CLASSIC,"UpTown Top Ranking is a classic song by Althea & Donna which was a BIG hit in 1977. Althea Forrest and Donna Reid were 17 and 18 respectively when the song was bubbling on the charts. This cd is full of the style from the Golden Age of reggae. Althea & Donna helped blaze the trail for other female artists. Produced and engineered with Karl Pitterson at the controls. Musicians like Sly & Robbie, Earl ""Chinna"" Smith, Bernard ""Touter"" Harvey, Scully, Tommy McCook, Vin Gordon and Herman Marquis provide the crucial instrumental journey. Even though I already had the classic song (it's included on various complilations) this cd is an essential addition to my collection. This release is an All Time Classic."
4,A classic if you like reggae,"Excellent album of these two girls. Recorded in Kingston in the golden years of the seventies with people like Marley or Tosh on the top of their success. They released as far I know only this record. Highly recomended with fantastic tracks like ""If You Donñt Love Jah"" or ""The West""."
4,Great information and easy reading,Easy reading enabling me to understand the Old Testament stories better. Look forward to reading more of Francine Rivers books
5,Unveiled: Tamar Book Review,"All bible stories are great, therefore his book is no exception. I have already recommended it to my friends. The shipment was timely and the book arrived in excellent condition."
5,A challenging story,"Francine Rivers has stated that she believes readers want to be challenged, and she has succeeded in doing that with Unveiled. She has told the story of a woman who is strong, courageous, and loyal, yet submissive to the will of God. Tamar is continually subjected to maltreatment from everyone around her, and is ridiculed for the decisions she makes, yet she stands firm, and is rewarded for her obedience in the end. I'm looking forward to the rest of this series-as usual, Francine has delivered."
5,A Woman of Patience,"This is the first Christian fiction book that I have read and I was not diappointed. I loved this book and could not put it down! While fictionalizing the story of Tamar, the author really defined what life was like for women of the times. I had never heard of Tamar before, although I am sure many have heard of her brother-in-law, Joseph and his many colored coat!The story was poignant for me because of the incredible amount of patience Tamar had! In our fast paced, instant gratification world, we are all impatient. The story of Tamar revealed the value of patience to me. Tamar waited four long years, enduring ridicule, abandonment and disdain. Tamar's story is one of expectant hope that God would provide for her.It is a story that can enrich all of our lives. The Seek and Find bible study questions were especially helpful in obtaining additional insights into the bible passages."
5,Fantastic Read,"This book is a fantastic read. It tells the story of Tamar from the Bible in a more everyday way that captures your attention and brings the story to life. I have read the series and LOVE it. I had a hard time grasping the depth of the stories when reading them in my Bible, but Francine Rivers does the impossible. She really brings to life the stories and puts them in regular language that really makes you feel as if you are there yourself. I would recommend this to everyone. Incredibly hard to put this down. Quick read because it captures your attention and holds it. Well done Mrs. Rivers."
5,A lovely Fast Read!,"What a lovely story. This author follows Tamar through her difficult situation into her bearing beautiful boys. Tamar is indeed a strong woman of her day and does what she feels she needs to do to fulfill the legacy of her married family. She turns to God and welcomes in her sons. Her final husband never touches her again.Read the story for the details surrounding the beautiful biblical interpretation done by Francine Rivers. You wont want to miss this one. Its so endearing and your heart will surely go out to this great child, woman, Tamar."
3,Not Francine Rivers at her best,"I am a devoted Francine Rivers fan and love her work. She, to me, is one of the most real Christian writers of our time. She's not afraid to touch on topics for which many Christians would criticize her.""Unveiled,"" though is not one of her best books. It just didn't flow very well for me. To be fair, I'm just not a big fan of the Old Testament stories (although I did love ""The Red Tent"") so maybe that's why I couldn't get into it.I still love Francine Rivers and will always pick up her books."
3,A pretty good *novel* with a bias Christian viewpoint.,"It's a good *novel*. Emphasis being on novel. She takes artistic license to write about the life and customs of Tamar and Canaanites and of course, gives it a very bias Christian view. Being that it's a book written by a Christian for Christians that's to be expected. It did hold my interest and I just had to keep reminding myself that this person probably hasn't a clue when it comes to ancient customs and to keep in mind she's taken a story from the Bible and given it her own spin. I can only give this book 3 stars because her obvious ignorance on the ancient customs will mislead people as to what the Canaanites were really like. Other than that it was an interesting piece of fiction."
5,A Great Read,"I'm not much of a beer drinker but this is a terrific book. Wells is an entertaining writer and also a good reporter and observer of human nature. You learn tons about the beer industry but he is clearly most interested in beer people, the quirkier the better. By the time you finish the chapter on Extreme Beer, you will understand practically all you need to know about the microbrew business but also why it attracts the kind of people who could be running companies in Silicon Valley. I had no idea I would want to read an entire chapter about beer yeast but I couldn't put it down. The trip down the River of Beer meanwhile is fun and a nicely paced travelogue. He ends up in one of my favorite cities New Orleans and his essay about its drinking proclivities is very, very funny (and true.) I highly recommend this book. It will make a great stocking stuffer this Christmas."
2,Not great,"I agree with the other reviewers that have rated this book low (3 stars or less) - the supposed mission that the author was on is completely blown by his choice of territory to cover and his personal schedule. This is like reading about the authors vacation - driving from small town to small town and going out for a beer each day. Let me tell you, this gets repetitive very quickly.The only thing I learned from this book are some towns to avoid if I am looking for a flavorful craft-brewed beer."
2,The Cheap American Pale Lager of Beer Books,"Simply awful. Though author Ken Wells may not have succeeded in finding ""the perfect beer joint"" (as the ""premise"" of this book seems to have been), he certainly succeeded in writing an awful book about a delightful subject.Travels with Barley is uninspired, aimless, uninteresting, and and pointless. I gave the book a very generous 2 stars only because I found the chapter on ""yeast rustling"" very interesting -- it would have made a very good newpaper feature article, as very few of the chapters in the books might have. This collection of mediocre newspaper articles is mashed up into one barely readable book.If you know little to absolutely nothing about beer but would like to learn a little or buy a nice gift for a beer lover, then DO NOT buy Travels with Barley (stick with one of Michael Jackson's books [not the King of P--, the Beer Writer])."
4,Better than Most Beer Stories,"I thought this was a pretty good read at least as far as much about beer are concerned. It's not the best book, and if I could score it a 3.5 I would. Wells has a fairly good idea, but as others stated its not perfectly executed.Wells conveys a good amount of information about American beer history and the current climate. He is very even handed regarding craft brewing, home brewing, and mega brewing. All too often beer authors cannot overcome their own opinions regarding craft, home, and mega brewing. The problems are that unfortunately the idea of traveling the Mississippi for beer spots was probably not the best spot. Too many of the bars Wells visits are the same: poor, lame, empty, tacky, and forgettable. I think this is because too many of Wells spots were in rural, decaying towns or within the Bible belt. Also a few locations are down right failures."
2,Two halves of one book.,"The book was divided into alternating chapters. One half was the journal like entry of the author on his search. The other was the in depth explanation of other aspects of American beer. I really appreciated the information he shared that did not directly involve him; the history of Budweiser, the field reporting of hop harvesting, the homebrew meetings attended in Houston, the Extreme brewing. But when he went into the detailed description of his drive south along the grand ol' Miss, I felt it was time to skip ahead to the next chapter. And especially when he tried to detail his evenings out at bars drinking beer... I remember trying to document a night of alcohol the morning after when affected by a hangover, not very complete."
5,How Do I Get This Kind of Job?,"Some years back it seemed like the country was being taken over by wine and fern joints. While wine's OK, a good beer is so much better. Then I visited California and wonder of wonders the brew-pub idea had gotten started. Life has been much better since.Now there are thousands of beers where once only MilCoorWeiser was available. I can't say that they are all good, but I'd sure liked to have travelled with Ken Wells while he was collecting the data for this book. I'd even have just carried his baggage just to get the left overs. Not only did he investigate beers all around the US, but he investigated beer joints. How did this fellow possibly get a job like that?Not only that, but I grew up about 30 miles from his home town in south Louisiana swamps. Boy are there some beer joints down there! I think I'm even going to have to go order some of his novels, if they are written as well as this book...."
2,Beer Snobs: This Book Is For You!,"Although this book is occasionally informative and interesting, Ken Wells devotes way too way much ink expressing contempt for anyone who dares to like American lagers. There is more than enough room in the beer world for lager fans and Hopheads to coexist."
2,Just okay...,"I had heard so much about Jivamukti! I really liked the book, and I was excitedly awaiting this video. I thought it started off with a bang and was great for about the first 10 minutes. After which, the poses were not that imaginative and I noticed that the sequencing was slightly off (ie; the verbal instruction did not match the movement). I didn't feel like I got a great yogic workout after this video. The song during Savasana was a totally cheesy instrumental bad folk song. I think this dvd is not worth the asking price. If you get it, buy it used..."
2,Very little instruction,"The two stars are for the lovely raga played continuously during the practice by musicians right there in the yoga studio. This DVD gives you the options of either David's instruction or Sharon's instruction in the voiceover. What you get here is not really instruction, but rather a poorly-timed loose verbal prompting through a very traditional (and frankly, unimaginative) sequence of postures. There is no warmup; the sun salutation flow begins full on and at a very brisk pace. If that's how you like to practice, then this video might be for you. OTOH, if you like to linger in a posture and if you like to hear reminders about body dynamics to help you reap the benefits of an asana and get deeper into the practice, you're out of luck with this one. If the DVD still appeals to you after reading this review, please buy mine! It's been viewed twice, and is in like new condition; I won't be using it again."
2,Beware of the song during savasana!,"I don't understand why, during savasana, the soundtrack includes a guy strumming an acoustic guitar and singing a song containing rather vapid lyrics. I find it completely disruptive. All the rest of this practice is accompanied by instrumental music played on Indian classical instruments, with NO SINGING, and it works fine as a backdrop to the instruction. Why introduce some folky singer-songwriter at the end, when it's necessary to ""pacify the sense organs?"" The whiney singing does absolutely the opposite for me. And yes, I could just mute the television, but there are cues from the instructors that happen afterwards, and it would be counterproductive to keep my eye on the clock (DURING SAVASANA) to know when the song is over and it's safe to un-mute the TV. I think it's a poor choice of music for that part of the practice, and if I'd read about that in a review beforehand, I definitely would not have put it on my xmas wishlist!"
1,Bad Bad Packaging!,"Just received my order of 3 dvds. Each packaged separately with the most annoying packaging! So annoying I felt compelled to write this review! Change the packaging, please! Each dvd was packaged in an envelope that is sticky inside. It required minor surgery to remove each dvd from each envelope!!! Please change the packaging! I will probably never buy from this retailer again. Sorry."
4,",,,awesome!!","I love to have variety! I had seen David Life in a documentary ""Titans of Yoga"", was impressed with his words, thought I would try out his dvd. And, I'm glad I did!! This is a well rounded practice, done at a rather quik pace, with a nice variety of asanas to work with. I loved Davids style, and his narration is uplifting and very helpfull with instruction. The music in the background is soothing. Would suggest to anyone to give this video a shot, I think it is a great product!!"
3,boring,"I love Jivamukti and consider myself an intermediate yogi. Only the first 10 min of this video were challenging, the rest was slow and boring, I didn't work up a sweat. Shannon's verbal ques were before she actually did the movement which was annoying. The set and music was nice and I appreciated her explanation on why shoulder stand and head stand are important. But in the end I didn't get a good yoga practice out of this video."
4,Very nice,I love the live indian music and that you can have with Shannon's or Davids voice giving the instructions. You can also have just the music. Nice! Good balanced workout.
5,Fantastic!,I love this workout. It's so peaceful. Great pace. Not at all fast like they suggested it would be. The routine on the dvd is amazing. I loved it.
1,Tastes terrible. Feels like lotion,"I ordered this after falling in love with the body cream. I wish I hadn't. It feels bad, taste bad and smells strong. Much like smelly lotion on your mouth. Not for me. The body cream is amazing, though. Try it!"
1,out dated,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. It was probably an excellent tool in its' day, but the information and forms have long since seen their usefulness.I should have known when I saw the operative word LICK in the title of this book.I haven't had to lick a stamp in a decade now that everything is self-adhesive !"
5,"A selection, emphasizing Abba's musical excellence.","This album contains a selection of the timeless Abba songs, which can be listened to, in any mood. It provides a mix which effectively blends the popular and the seldom heard. Each song on the album runs deep in meaning, influencing your thoughts, each time you hear it. An essential buy for all those into Abba."
3,Poor Quality Control; good customer service,"Two of the eight wires in the set I received were bad. On one wire the spark plug terminal was inserted incorrectly into the boot making is impossible to connect to a spark plug. On another the cable was connected incorrectly to the spark plug terminal causing infinite resistance and making that wire unusable.After contacting Taylor Cable Products, they sent two replacement wires."
2,Long-awaited...but a disappointment,"After falling in love with Dee's evocative, unique first recording ""Regarding the Soul"", I found ""The Map"" to be trite, over-produced, and just plain uninteresting. There didn't seem to be the passion or the completely original presentation that so amazed me with the first CD. I actually gave ""The Map"" away to a friend after a few hearings (she, too, was disappointed). I hope that Dee returns to the exquisite, simple arrangements that so beautifully highlighted her voice and tender harp playing. Her first recording is by far the finest."
1,"Sounds great, doesn't turn out well.","In the sauces, the wines don't reduce well. The flavors are too strong for the dishes. At first glance, the recipies look good, but they dom't stand up to cooking."
2,"A simple list of words & translations, nothing more.","Uzbek dictionaries are hard to find. This claims to be the only one available in North America. Your key to the language and culture, and ideal for travelers. This I find slightly overstated. This is just a list of words & transalations, no information on grammar or Uzbekistan. As a book for travelers, the phonetic pronunciations are inadequate, they need to be included in both sections, Uzbek-English and English-Uzbek for both Uzbek speaking people learning English and English speakers learning Uzbek. A simple list of basic phrases and greetings, please & thank you etc., would go a long way to improving this book. Still, with 8000 entries it does give at least a reasonable list of words for a concise dictionary."
2,Great if you think that Uzbek is Turkish,"There are very few Uzbek-English dictionaries out there. There are even fewer good ones, and this sadly is not one of the best. I used this for first-year Uzbek in college, and by the time I was done there were more hand-written corrections in the book than typed definitions. The author has borrowed a lot of Turkish and said that it is Uzbek, so the more advanced the vocabulary, the more likely you are to be better served on the streets of Ankara than those of Bukhara. It's a good pocket dictionary for beginners, but don't think that you will be translating for Islam Karimov."
2,Not what I expected,"My 9 year old daughter couldn't get the doll to stand on the stand. Even with my help, the doll would still fall over. Not sure if we're doing something wrong. As a parent, I don't like toys that kids can't get to work."
5,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful album full of great songs sung by women from Latin America. Countries such as Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and the Dominican Republic. These are upbeat songs for the most part, which reflect the influences of African and European music on the Native South and Central American cultures. The 27 page booklet contains a photo and information on each artist and song as well as an introduction to Latin American music and the roles that women played in it. The booklet is written in both English and Spanish. Each and every song on this album is wonderful, impossible to choose a favourite."
3,from an actors point of view...,"Eric Bogosian's take on life as well as other people is well depicted in his writing. After a performance of ""The Fan"" out of this book to audience of 500, I got praise including a standing ovation. I recommend this book to an actor who is committed to energy, fun, and improvised movement."
1,7' telescoping squeegee without the telescoping pole,"Be warned! This does not include the telescoping pole. How it can be advertized as a ""7' telescoping squeegee"" when the 7' telescoping pole isn't included is a mystery. Misleading since nothing in product description mentions that the pole isn't included."
4,2 classic albums on one disc,"Bobby Vee was a sixteen year old kid when his band ""The Shadows"" made their first professional appearance at a concert in Moorhead, Minnesota on Feb.3rd 1959. It was the day Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens were killed in the plane crash. These singers, had they lived, would have played in Moorhead. The show went on and local talent was asked to fill in. This was the start of Bobby Vees career. Bobby was heavily influenced by Buddy and sounded alot like him. In 1962 ""Meet the Crickets"" was released with drummer Jerry Allison, Joe B. Mauldin on bass and a newer member. This album featured a mix of Buddys songs and others. ""I remember Buddy Holly"" was released in 1963 and featured ""Buddys Song"" which used titles of Buddys hits to make a song, a fun tune. Even if you have Buddys original recordings you'll want this one as well. I would buy this one!!!"
1,Belt Holster is too small,I bought two each but the KRZR phone will not fit this holster. Too small. Replacements were the same. Don't buy until this problem is addressed
1,Barclay,"Maybe one song in this album is listenable, actually no - to be honest it would be better if they just didn't sing!This is like a Saturday night live skit gone bad. I guess if you are really into obscure German electonica this might be for you. But most of the songs like Throw up or Stop Bothering Michael Jackson simple suck."
3,Great if it was longer.,"I was soooo excited about this toy but is you see the picture on the spygear website ( spygear.net/spyflash.php?toyid=10029 )look at that person! what good does a periscope 5 inches long do? If you stand on your toes, won't it be the same?So, if you've been wanting this very badly, why don't you make one yourself that's longer instead? After all, you're spying, not spy gear collecting!"
1,Discardable within 1 day...,"Toy is of not much use. The periscope, although functional, is much too short for the child to hide behind a wall or sofa and ""spy"" on others. Its poor optics makes it difficult to make out anything clearly.My daughter is very excited about spy stuff, but dumped this in less than a day as useless."
5,Incredible!,"I think this toy is awesome. I can spy on the bullies at school, and stick it in my pocket when I'm through! This is is incredible!"
5,Top notch songs; good compilation. Good for newcomers.,"This album has all top quality songs from Free Design, and would be a good introduction album for new listeners. It contains background information on the group, as well as recording studio photos. The entire album can be listened to at one sitting. It is perfect when you are in that happy-go-lucky mood. My favorites are ""Bubbles"", ""Kije's Ouija"", and ""Never Tell The World"". If you like retro 70's t.v. theme music, you'll dig this album."
5,We miss Raul Julia,"At first look, I didn't think anyone else could play the zany role of Gomez like John Asten. I was right. Raul Julia brings his own wacky interpretation. Together with Angelica Houston and Christopher Lloyd, you get two great films: The Addams Family and Adams Family Values. The ADDAMES FAMILY - (1991) Uncle Fester is found. For 1/4 of decade, he's been wandering the Bermuda Triange. But there is something odd to this honored Addam's family member. Could he be the real deal? The family of Addams decide to test him. ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES - (1993) Morticia is pregnant with a third child. Historically, the Addams family has a gruesome tradition for such an event. Watch out Pugsly. In order to keep domestic peace, Gomez hires a strange normal-looking babysitter who keeps from telling him about her criminal past. **These stories are family fun to watch. Special effects, great costumes, enjoyable dialogue exchanges. I like the new Wednesday. She's good."
2,Careful when ordering a used copy,"I clicked through to buy a used copy from this page (the 2011 version), and ended up purchasing the 1977 edition, which doesn't include the Kai Nelsen essay I was wanting to purchase the book for in the first place. Bummer. I didn't catch it (doh), but I also think these links are set up in a confusing way. Be careful if you're trying to buy this edition used."
3,Another Overpriced College Book,Book required for a college course. Should be around $25 - not $71! Would not have purchased if not needed for school.
2,Don't make the same mistake I did!,I ordered this thinking it was the novel. It's not. It is a very condensed version of the novel. My mistake. Will read more carefully next time.
3,"Ok Cover, But doesn't hold up too well","I purchased my previous cover two seasons ago. After research, Covermax seemed to be the best product for the money. The bike is parked outside all the time, but not subjected to full sun. I'm located in the pacific northwest, so plenty of rain though. Cover did sweat a bit, but the big problem is the fact that it's literally rotting away. Mostly at the bottom around the elastic and 6-8 inches up. No warranty coverage replacement."
4,"Divorce, German-American style","I loved German teacher Glen Cady, and was wrapped up in his story over the course of one enjoyable weekend. Weesner does a great job of getting inside both the head of Glen Cady and the heart of this sad tale of splitting up, finding love on two continents, losing one's profession, and then finding happiness all over again. I especially liked the dual stories, set in the USA and Germany."
5,Recommend this book to everyone,I recommend this book to everyone because it really helps you to see how family and family dysfunction can truly make you or break you. It is thoughtfully and skillfully written and I appreciate the intellect behind it.
5,Insightful,"This book was recommeneded to me by my counselor/therapist. I found it insightful, illuminating, and very helpful. It helped me better understand family dynamics in general and offered me a window into my role within my family in particular. I strongly recommend it to students and non-students alike."
3,Handbook for many,"This book is a handbook for so many people. I learn something everytime I pick it up. Some books read like a textbook and a novel - packed with info without sacrificing flow and accessibility. This is just textbook, in my opinion. Still, it is worthwhile and I am glad I have it."
5,Maybe his best?,"I think I've read them all, love them all, but this one puts the pressure on. Most important to me--the writing. Two lines in the flashback to the crime are the most gripping dialogue I can think of, ending with ""Not yet, Daddy."" Wow! And I still wish I could sit down with Hardy & Glitsky!"
4,4 and a half stars is not bad.,"Lescroart ewrote this fast paced thriller. I enjoed it a lot! ""Undownputable"". A great thriller. Dont miss this one. Its not bad for 4 and a half stars. The beginning is great the ending is a tour de force!"
3,Dis-appointing end,"Well written, as you would expect, and a good story. However, the end of the story has completely different feel and pace to it, almost as though the author decided he couldn't bring himself to write the dramatic end it deserved. The effect of this on me was to ruin the good feelings I had about the book up to that point = but that could just me!"
4,"Absorbing, complex, a real winner","Though I find I have to write notes to keep track of the many names in Mr. Lescroart's books, I love his work. ""Hard Evidence"" immediately draws you in and doesn't let go until the final paragraphs. There are few easy answers in this book, just as I suspect there are few easy answers in criminal justice. Virtually all of the plot is 100% credible and it flies along. Can't wait to start my next Lescroart!"
5,"It's a ""10""","Music straight from the heart. Songs from a group of young men and women who must know what it is to walk with GOD. The song ""My father knows"" Will bring you to your knees in praise!"
4,Fresh New Sound,"Angels Along the Way is not just the same old stuff. By combining some existing styles and showing some new talent, His Own does more than simply cover old songs by other artists. The song My Father Knows is the kind of tender work that makes you keep repeating that track.I'm looking forward to the next project by this new group."
4,Not what was pictured just the amber lense.,Great price and snapped right on where the broken lense was. Any one and handle this simple project of replacing a broken or cracked lense. Good as new now.
2,Bad quality most of it!,"The toob includes 20 plastic horses. They are 1 1/2"" size. But just 6 of them were high quality and beautyfull,, the rest were very different, and dint't like them. Some of them were also damaged."
2,GREAT FOR 30 OR UNDER AGE GROUP,GRACE SLICK OF THE JEFFERSON AIRPLANE FAME MAY HAVE HAD A BETTER VOICE-AND THAT IS HARD TO EVEN SAY THAT~ I THINK A LOT OF NOTES ARE FLAT AND THE MUSICALITY JUST NOT OF GOOD QUALITY. THERE ARE SO MANY BEAUTIFUL VOICES OUT THERE AND THIS GROUP FALLS SHORT.
1,Very Dissapointed,"I chose this product based on the experience I have had with Amazon. I reviewed this set for possible inclusion in classroom training I conduct. The material is outdated and biased. I got a history lesson when I was expecting a timely presentation of the topic of terorism. It wouldn't be so bad as far as history lessons go, but the lessons were outdated. I am very dissapointed."
3,It wasn't THAT bad.,"While, it wasn't the most vocally stirring recording I ever purchased, it really wasn't horrible. You can hear that she is very influenced by Ms. Ross, a fact supported in her liner notes. Give it a chance. Nice poppy flavor without the teen syrup."
4,Will someone please give this cutie a break?! It's NOT THAT BAD!!!,"It would be wrong to call this a truly wonderful album, but there is nothing really wrong with it, either. The backbeats are funky, well-produced, and mostly non-sampled, and no matter how closely you listen, you will not hear any rappers in the background. She's not a fantastic singer, but she can certainly sing better than a certain someone whose talent can pretty much be described her initials (think ""B.S.""). If you like fun, innocent dance-pop, this is a good album to have in your collection."
1,Worst CD of 1998,What a dismal failure. I listened to the CD once and it ended up in the resell pile. The songs are boring. Her voice is shrill and I can't understand who gave her a recording contract. Then again maybe it didn't have anything to do with her voice just her looks. I would not take this CD if it were free.
1,yeah....like one good song,"if you've ever heard laila's ""here we go again"", just buy the single....the album is an atrocity. Laila makes good on only the one song, and the others fall far short of anything near good. take ""heaven"" for example...""oooh/i'm in heaven when i'm with you""....classy, and original. the songwriting is horrible. again, on ""It ain't over 'til it's over"" try this ""it ain't over 'til it's over/it ain't over 'til we say goodbye""....brilliant. i mean, our music world right now has lots of sophomoric albums, but none rivals this as the loser album that is out right now....son't get me wrong, the one song is great, but that's where it ends. don't waste your time, if you want fun music, go buy shooter's ""and your point..."", it's far better."
5,Loved It.,My daughter loves the penquins and I have enjoyed watching them with her. They have great lessons taught in a fun way with lots of humor.
3,Disappointed,"I'm a great fan of Anger/Marshall, have been for 20 years, and bought this album because they're part of it. I have to admit, though, that I'm stuck on their playing in a pure string band setting. There's such rhythmic drive without drums or electrics, and you get to hear what's going on. With the addition of drum and electric bass, a lot of nuance is lost. I know it's their right to stretch out, but it's my right to be disappointed."
5,What I've Learned Is Worth Much More Than the Book's Price!,"The author Michael Molinski makes complicated materials easy for the individual investor to understand. Written in plain, everyday English for the common man. Very insightful and informative. This book is not just about investing overseas, but overall, it is about investing wisely. It touches upon a lot of investing issues, such as diversifying a portfolio, risks aversion, time span and horizon, etc. Specifically, however, Molinski makes a strong and convincing argument for investing in Latin America and shows readers how to go about doing so. Finally, he examines 35 Latin American companies that he sees as having good potential growth in the future. Molinski seems like an authority in Latin America investing because his insights could only have come from someone who's lived in the region and worked there for some time. Having read the book, I will definitely invest money in the Latin American region."
4,Inspiring Book,Want to be better or the best at what you do? This is the kind of book you use to fuel inspiration at a foundational level.
3,Not so good as an introduction,"So I am given this book by a colleague and told that it's a great book to teach proportion in art from. It has got some pretty and neat overlays, but I feel like it manages not to say very much. Also... there's something about this book that feels like there's an entire context that you're missing when you read it- I felt as though I was reading a math textbook in parts, that the focus wasn't nearly enough on how you as an artist can work an understanding of geometry into your own work. Also, pages 34 and 36 start with the same sentence.I just feel.. confused after reading this. I have only 2 notebook pages of notes, double-spaced. I feel like this book can be summed up by: ""The human eye instinctively likes certain proportions and in order to be a good designer you must understand and use geometry."" Ok, great, but how? In other words, this book is like half of a thesis- lacking the parts that tell me how to go forward."
2,Interesting but Lacking,"This is a good book for someone who has never delved into the subject. I find that it follows the same track as others in making the golden proportioning system fit about anything they want it to. Probably the most disappointing thing is the book's assembly: there are numerous overlays in the book that are not aligned with the images they are overlaying. The deviations are from slight to almost 1/4"" - very bothersome to view. This is more of a problem with mediocre quality control and concern by Princeton Architectural Press. It's good that the book is relatively inexpensive or I would have returned it."
3,From Architect Perpsective,"I bought this book primarily to see the studies of proportions in architecture. There are very few examples (really only 4 pages dedicated to that subject and 3 buildings analyzed) shown here. It does, however, give a myriad of ways to lay out different proportions using rectangles, circles, triangles, pentagons, etc. These, along with the examples of proportion in nature and on the human body were enough to spark my imagination as to how proportion can be used in design of buildings, but if you are looking for broad analysis of architectural proportions, look elsewhere. The examples that are given are mainly of poster design in the 1900s and Modern furniture design."
4,Good Intro with examples,"As a design student i have found this book to be very informative, yet it doesn't really get into too much detail which for me is good. This book is good for understanding the golden seccion and how it has been applied in some of the most memorable designs of all times as well as in architecture and other forms. If you want a full, no-details-left-out kind of book this is not it. The most important thing about this book is the examples. for begginers it really helps to see that proportion and composition is not just a matter of intuition or chance."
4,Nice little Gummies,"Nice chewie little sugarless Gummies. All the flavor and texture of regular. I just wish the came with sugar alcohol information. Other than that a fine product, with excellent delivery."
2,Story Lost Among Too many Details,"As a previous reviewer stated, this manuscript was written at war's end as an internal British Government report. I would assume that it was to be studied by future military leaders as a blueprintfor future military campaigns. I was so overwhelmed by all of the facts and details, that I could not find a ""story line."" Story as well as ""character development"" are sorely lacking. In fairness to the author, this was written as a ""report"" not a narrative. Nordid the author have the benefit of time to gain an overall perspective of the events described. I would recommend that any prospective readers look for a different source!"
2,"social satire, war story, disaster tale limply rolled into one","This book deals with a new ice age enveloping the world. It spends far too much time on the romantic triangle that forms an unnneccessary core of the plot. Frankly, I didn't like any of the characters except the African, Abonitu. There was some nice bits of social satire showing the displaced refugee Brits getting the royal screwing over and exploitation from their African hosts that they so richly deserve but for the most part this book is a rather dull exploration of what should have been a ripping good yarn."
5,"""Body Heat"" Movie Soundtrack","Having lived in St. Petersburg, Florida for many years, I can attest that this soundtrack captures the mood, heat, and humidity of Florida beautifully. I've run my movie tape so many times just to hear the music, that the tape is almost worn out. When I hear the piano and saxophone on this soundtrack, I can just feel the stifling heat, especially at night, and I love it. Buy it! You won't be sorry!"
3,Great voice but too polished,"If you are looking for a controlled, formatted Nina Storey then this is the CD for you. If you want to hear an incredible vocalist like Nina Storey give it everything thing she has then I would certainly recommend her live recording ""Bootleg"". The live 9 minute plus version of ""Left"" is alone worth the price of the CD."
5,Powerful Voice,"Shades is one of my favorite Nina Storey releases. I've had the privilege of hearing Nina sing live. The first time I heard ""No Man"" I was absolutely blown away. The recording is no less spectacular. Shades was the first of many Nina Storey recordings that I have purchased. Her powerful voice will keep you coming back for more."
3,"amazing voice, but the music...","I give this album 3 stars because I was shocked and amazed at what a beautiful voice Nina Storey has, however, the music just falls flat behind her. With her kind of energy I can only imagine her live. If you buy this CD you may be disappointed in the music and production, but you will never regret hearing Nina Storey's voice."
5,Nina really belts it out on Shades.,Nina's mix of rock and blues tantalizes the ear drums of many listeners. She has an amazing voice which she is not shy about using. I think the CD could have been produced a little better because Nina's voice wasn't showcased to its fullest potential. Shades is a CD that just about anyone can enjoy no matter what kind of music they normally listen to. Nina's singing speaks volumes. The CD Shades posesses a unique quality: the music is real and from the heart.
2,Looking for the energy and emotion of her live show?!,"Well, you won't find it here. I bought this CD after seeing Nina live and was very disapointed. The power and emotion that she emits live somehow failed to make it on to this CD. More of a performer than a songwriter."
3,So-so pop,"An awful lot of reviews for an unknown artist...and oddly enough, 90% of them are approximately the same length and stylistically identical to one another!"
5,There is nobody out there quite like her,I think Nina Storey is absolutly incredible. I havn't found one person yet who doesn't love the CD Shades. She is so talanted. I could listen to the CD over and over again and I have.
5,WOW!,this is how a mix cd should be made!! live without much edits and what-nots...mixed live represents the way cox rocks the crowd: full of energy!! i wish the cd have a video in it also. to watch carl cox in person is an experience..
5,An excellent work of techno bliss!,"Carl Cox is more than just your average dj today. He strays away from all the awful trance that lurks around every corner in clubs and raves. He plays straight up hard, funky tekno. For anyone who really wants to find that one amazing techno album, look no furthur than Carl. Techno at its very best."
3,Music Ruined by Crowd Yelling,"Carl Cox is Awesome. He picks good vinyl to spin, and he does just that for this live recording, which is unfortunately ruined by very annoying screams and yelling from the crowd. Some crowd chatter during the intro of the CD is acceptable, but this album has it marring every track of this CD, which would have otherwise been masterpiece of Techno music. Somebody fire the sound guy who left the mic on during this recording, and tell that ""chick"" to quit screaming over all the good parts of the music! She made me waist $15 bucks, thanks a lot."
2,Nothing but banging noises,"That's all there is to this CD. Just one banging high BPM noises after another. Track after track. The mix is almost incoherent at times and all the track sound alike. There is simply no melodies to distinguish one track from another. No doubt Carl Cox is one of the most famous DJ's around the globe, but this CD makes him look bad. One star because it's Carl Cox and another star for the ""live"" effort."
2,could only tolerate it once....,"like most moonshine releases, aimed at a new techno-pop audience, they don't stand the test of time due to their lack of true musical vision and soul. Carl Cox, who I cannot deny has skills on the decks as proved in this mix, spins a bombardment of your typical hard-house tracks- all looped and filtered samples with no build-ups or brakdowns; nothing that would keep someones interest if it wasn't ""mixed"". I could only hear it once, when I tried to hear it again a second time, but found myself skipping through the entire cd."
4,good shape builder,"the second of the three block sets i got my daughter. its fun for her because she loves to show off how well she can stack things on the little pegs. shes only 18 months. this one is her favorite. a lot of blocks were stuck together on this one and when you pull it apart you can see chipped paint but with toddlers, theyll chip them up anyway right?"
2,Target has a better one,"We bought one just like this in Target, made for Target and it has none of the problems listed on this product. Paint is still intact after many plays, looks still like new and we have so much fun with it. Stacking and sorting colors, making color piles, then shape piles, then stack by color, by shape etc. It has lots of uses to prevent boredom. Great toy. Yes, you should be careful not to have in laying down in the middle of the room or someplace where your toddler can fall on it. Clean up after play and just have fun with this."
5,Great like all M & D products,My two and a half year old swiped this from the dentist's office (with permission). She loves it and so does my one year old son.
3,stick came off after few months,"my two years old doesn't seem to appreciate this much yet. She kept taking everything off and just randomly lay them out on the table. Since every kid is different, i will give a bit of time, i think it will have good educational value eventually. However, one disappointment is one of the stick came loose after just a few months. And she wasn't even playing that much with it, this shows the quality still needs improvement."
1,Has potential to be dangerous,"A friend got this for our toddler. It's a great idea but poorly executed. We didn't have any problems with paint or anything like that. Problem is, when the pieces come off, you are left with three thin dowels/stands sticking straight up. Anyone who has a toddler knows that is an accident waiting to happen. One trip head first into this thing and the dowels are thin enough to take out an eye. Also, the edges are not smoothed down, so it also has the potential to tear skin if landed on.I would suggest that Melissa and Doug use MUCH thicker stands that are smoothed and rounded at the top."
1,Paint Chips,"I was excited that my brother gave this to my son for Christmas, because I am a fan of wooden toys... the less toxic plastic toys around the better as far as I am concerned. However I was VERY disappointed when the paint started chipping off. It was coming off and sticking to my hands...there was no way I was going to let my son play with it! I returned the defective item."
5,love this toy,I got this for My DD because she liked the one at the doctors office. when it came in the mail I was unpacking the box and she saw it and got so excited. Melissa and Doug items are great. I bought one for my DD and one for a friends boy.
4,Just don't lose a piece......,"I'll start by saying that i love their products. Anything without batteries that holds my son's attention for that long? How can one go wrong. Easy. Lose a piece. My son misplaced one of the round pieces. I wrote to Melissa and Doug. They responded that each one was hand made and therefore there are no replacement pieces. I respect their craftsmanship and quality but come on, have a couple of extras made for spare parts in case someone loses one. I am sure I was not the first to request one."
1,"Beware, this bleeds","Maybe it's non-toxic but after a half hour of our toddler playing with this - although he enjoyed it - his hands were red and there were red stains on his t-shirt. So its in the garbage now. Is it non-toxic I don't know, though if toy makers used toxic paints for years and lied about them, there's little reason to believe a label that boldly says non-toxic. How many pieces of clothing out there with Gucci labels are not made by Gucci?"
2,Poor quality control,"When we got this toy out of the box, about a third of the pieces were stuck together because the toy had apparently been packaged when the paint was still wet. When I pried the pieces apart, paint from one piece was stuck on the other piece. After I was done, it was looking pretty ugly."
2,Paint comes off,"If your baby is going to put it in his/her mouth, the paint would start coming off. I caught my 10 months old daughter putting it in her mouth and i saw paint coming off"
4,no paint issues,"I received this toy today (12/11/09). I was concerned because of other reviews stating that the blocks stuck together from a poor paint job. I am happy to report that the paint job is fine and no pieces are sticking together.I understand concerns about the posts that stick up and would suggest using without the base for kids who aren't stable enough yet. I preferred this version to the standard plastic baby one since instead of just allowing for standard stacking, this toy also helps kids learn how to fit different shapes together and sort by size, shape or color. When my daughter was young enough to need the baby version, she had no ability to stack so I skipped the baby one. She's now 15mo's old and ready for the better wooden one. I'm glad I waited."
3,"Great idea, bad quality! Paint comes off!","The more Melissa & Doug toys I buy, the more I am realizing how bad they are! It's such a shame too, because the toy concepts are so great, but the quality is just lacking. From the moment I got it, I could tell the paint job was bad, you could see peg marks from where they had a piece attached to something, then painted all around it. The worst part is the paint comes off onto everything!! The pieces are practically crayons! My son rubbed this against our white wall and realized he could use it to draw!! We've had it for about a year now and the blocks look terrible. I would not recommend this... there are much better quality wooden toys on the market."
2,Beware.This toy may hurt little ones,This toy may be good for education and play time but it could be dangerous if your little one is small enough.Once all the rings are taken off then the poles are dangerous if little one falls on it.I bought but not be using untill 2+ years.
4,Melissa & Doug have something good going on,"Our eight month old son loves his new geometric stacker. It was an instant like for our son, and he is not easily won over with toys, we are still discovering what he likes. The only drawback is when you wash the blocks in mild soap the paint chips off, this my son won't mind and probably won't ever notice - but as a mom - I do. But, I think it was worth buying and the price is right - Melissa & Doug have something good going on with their geometric stacker!"
3,good BLOCKING fun,"Overall a good stacking block for my 2-3yr old. She can stack everything as shown, name every color, and count too, plus tell me mostof the shapes of the blocks. A good dexterity and learning colors, counting, and what each shape is called.I would suggest a BIGGER bulky blocks (less halfs or smaller blocks) for younger 1-2yr olds to start off with 1st and work there way to this buy2.5yrs old. But do start young 1 to 1 1/2 with bigger blocks and they can work there way to this like my kids did.Would rate a 3.8 out 5. not a 100% amazing learning toy or that has lasting fun for a child but a good advance to a lower level stacker/rings etc."
2,Broke within the first 2 days,"One of the wooden dowels came unglued within the first 2 days my daughter was playing with it. Also, the largest wooden (red) circle is very resistant to go on the dowel or come off of it. She likes the toy, but get mad because she can't play with the red circle, and gets upset when it come apart."
1,Blue Mouth,"My 10 month old daughter received this toy for Christmas from her grand parents. She started playing with it right away and of course pieces went right into her mouth. Her grandma assured me it was a quality product with safe paint and construction. Well she was as floored as I was then when we saw blue stain all over my daughter's mouth! I took the block and rubbed it with my hand - and off came more paint. We put it up and she has yet to play with it again- maybe when she is no longer putting everything in her mouth, but she might be bored by it then."
1,Absolutely Hate It!,"This product seemed like a good idea. It's colorful and seemed like a great learning toy. After I received it, I realized how dangerous it really is. There are a lot of sharp corners and the post are also scary. My child fell on it and was hurt pretty bad. Also, my little one picked up the toy by one of the post and the post just came off. It's poorly constructed and it's a hazard to kids. I tried to return it but was told my return window had expired. Please don't waste your money on this product."
1,Not what it looks like on the website,This is not really like what it looks like in the website. It is smaller than it appears and does not seem to be very sturdy. I was expecting a more robust toy for this price.
3,Kat,"I really like this toy to teach color and shapes however my daughter hardly plays with it, it doesn't hold her attention"
4,Great quality,"I bought this as a gift for my two year old son this past Christmas and he absolutely loved it! The paint and wood is great quality, they don't chip and don't smell or mark other things with the paint. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because it seems to only entertain my son for so long, perhaps because he has other toys around him I know it's hard for kids to just stick to one thing but the square part seems a bit advanced for his age perhaps as he gets older he will get better at it and I shall update my review!"
4,Great design and product,"This is a more sophisticated version of the old plastic stacking rings. I like that there are 3 categories of shapes and several colors. We purchased this for our 20 month old daughter for Christmas and have enjoyed stacking the blocks by shape and by color. Regarding design, it is very well made (from wood).A drawback is that this toy does not lock in place for storage (which I did not expect or anticipate). It does get a little crazy when my daughter scatters the pieces everywhere (there are a lot to keep up with), so we do not keep this toy in a toy box. For storage, it really must be put together and kept separate. The only other drawback is the square blocks are a little too complex for a 2 year old.If you're in the business of purchasing a million wooden objects for a small child, I recommend getting the Melissa & Doug Classic ABC Block Cart so they can build / stack them together."
3,Not sure if this batch is part of recall...,"CBC News excerpt regarding this product quoted below:""The federal agency (Health Canada) issued the barium-related recalls for the seven children's toys between August and October...In August, (recall) notices were issued ...A stacking toy set called ""Geometric Stacker"" by Melissa and Doug (item 094730, UPC 000772005678, batch ZP1207)."""
1,Lead,"The red pieces tested positive for lead. How I wish I could turn back time and ""unbuy"" this. If I could rate it a zero, I would."
1,Must attend children playing with this,"To begin playing, take the blocks off the poles. At first I was worried she would fall over and hurt herself on these exposed poles. Next, the poles fell off, which then exposes this clear glue which my child wants to chew on.Just like the sorting cube I bought with this, the colored paint chips off. The square is 2 shapes which fit to be a square. Seems like a good advanced concept, but mostly concerned of the sharp edges. So those were put away.I should have bought one of the plastic versions of this. The paint would not have chipped off. And maybe the poles would have been attached to the base rather than adhered with toxic glue."
1,"Great design, abysmal fabrication","Quality control on the product is nil. Had to return item because the parts were assembled with wet paint, so ALL of them stuck together--required a knife to separate and all of them ended up with severely chipped paint. The replacement was worse. DON'T BUY IT. A shame, because the design is great--its more complex than other versions. But stick with the better ones--Plan Toys for instance."
2,"Not durable, sticks come off and paint comes off","I really like Melissa & Doug toys however, we've only had this toy for two days and with three children playing with it (total probably 4 hours of play so far), the sticks were not glued into base and quickly popped off (the baby did that first thing after removing all the pieces). The other part I did not like was the fact that paint is starting to come off already on the square pieces (on the corners). Even if the paint is lead-free, I still don't think it should come off after two days of play. I am hoping to write the company and ask them about that."
2,Disappointed,"Out of all the toys I have bought my child, this has been the most disappointing. The paint has chipped off so easily that I know feel they are unsafe for her to play with. It makes me rethink buying any other Melissa and Doug products."
5,great toy for 16 mth old,"Our 16mth old grand daughter loves this toy. She has mastered putting all the blocks in the right place. Now we are working on getting the colors in the right columns, one more week and she will have that down. We also place with the rounds ones, use them as rings, so she can be fancy. Then another thing we do is not use the stacker just the blocks and I see how high I can stack them before she knocks my pile over. She loves this and it's a great booster for her, she can beat gramma before I get them all stacked. She loves it and plays with it all the time. I highly recommend it for great hand and eye coordination."
2,Fun but easily broken,"I bought this for my son for his 2nd birthday and he loved it! He played with it all the time but we had to take it away from him when, with very little effort, he was able to remove all the poles from the base of the puzzle. We tried fixing the problem, but we weren't able to get the poles to stay in their slots correctly. Eventually, the puzzle pieces would knock the poles over and we ended up throwing the puzzle away. It's a great concept, and I'd love to purchase another one, but I'm not going to knowing that the same thing could happen again. There has to be a better way for Melissa and Doug to attach the poles so that they will actually stay on the base."
1,Save Your Money,"I did not find the dvd's helpful. The two folks in the 1st video sign entirely too fast plus the back ground for the host and hostess was horrible and it was tough making out their signs. What 'is' of use in the video (both) I learned more easily from 'TALKING WITH YOUR HANDS, LISTENING WITH YOUR EYES'-Gabriel Grayson, also obtained via Amazon, and much more for your money. In Fact, skip the video's and buy 2 copies of the book because you will easily wear the book out if you are serious about learning sign on your own.The 2nd video of this 2 set collection was a little better, clarifying the alphabet, but, save your money for maybe another video, or again, 2 of the Gabriel Grayson books.I showed the 1st video to my deaf friend to get his opinion. He looked at me,laughed, and shook his head no. He said it was too fast for someone new and he didn't care for the presentation. I didn't bother to show him the 2nd video."
2,Sign Language DVD Difficult To Use,I found that the Sign Language DVD was not easy to use. The DVD has two people signing to each other in multiple chapters. I thought it was difficult to follow some of the signs and sometimes very difficult to tell which sign went with which word. I felt myself constantly rewinding to see if I could figure it out.
1,Not Helpful,"This product is good only if you already have an understanding of sign language and are looking for a way to brush up. The signs are shown entirely too fast for someone who doesn't know any signs and the mock-scenarios only succeed in aggravating would be learners. Even the sections detailing the alphabet are done too fast to be learned effectively. The only useful part of this purchase is the DVD-ROM dictionary that comes with it. This allows the would-be learner to move at their own pace and repeat words, letters and signs at will. Overall not a good buy, and no, I will not be recommending this to anyone."
2,Why cost to learn ASL ?,"I don't think there should be too big of costs, if any, too learn foriegn languages or other types like ASL. DVD's are not a great way to learn sign language in my opinion. Anyone is going to have to reverse, repeat, rewind and so forth to really learn. Don't do it on any of these DVD's. There is a fantastic website done by a professor of ASLU named Lifeprint.com that is easier to go directly where you want, Visual dictionary, video lessons and just 10x better !! There is no catch just all free."
1,not user friendly,I have an autistic child that we are trying to teach sign-language as well as the entire family learn. This video is not usere or family friendly the kids lose interest within minutes of it being on so they know the first sign that is displayed and that is it. The quality and age of the video is terrible.
3,Hunky Dory - Bowie,"My mom and I think this is our best David Bowie record. Every song is great and couldn't be better. My favorite two are CHANGES and OH! YOU PRETTY THINGS. The song about Bob Dylan --- you might think I'm crazy, but I get a kick out of that song because it has some humor in it.Enjoy!"
5,"Most ""accessible"" Bowie album","Are you new to Bowie's music? Did his glam phase scare you? Or maybe his techno, drum'n'base, or ""plastic soul"" phase? Well, like they say, ""you got to learn to walk before you can run"". Start from this album, Hunky Dory. I really do not want to categorize Bowie's music because it is a mixture of different genres that makes his music so unique and special, but if I have to choose, I say this music is in a ""pop"" category. The album contains many melodic ""pop-ish"" tunes like ""Changes"" and ""Oh! You pretty thing!"" that do not overwhelm you with weird synthesized noise or just plain weird sound. Lyrics may be little out there but the songs themselves are very easy to listen to. You'll love this album. I can honestly say that all the songs in here are strong and I love 'em all. How often do you run into an album that has all the songs you love? Get this album, you will not regret it!"
4,Folk-y Bowie Not Quite What's Expected,"If you're not familiar with David Bowie's ever-changing styles, his career can look like a real mish-mash. He goes through some definite phases. ""Hunky Dory"" is still much more folky than some of Bowie's later work. The big hit from this album is ""Changes,"" memorable for its stuttering hook. However, two cuts of which I'm inordinately fond are ""Andy Warhol"" (to which one of my birds loved to sing ... it really wound him up, and I'm not sure why) and ""Song for Bob Dylan."" The latter shows Bowie's vocal versatility in an interesting way ... his ability to sound strangely like Dylan himself. This is an important album in terms of Bowie's career history ... just not one of my absolute favorites. It's vital, though, that true Bowie-philes own a copy."
4,Great Early Effort By Bowie,"Overall and inspired effort by Bowie. Hunky Dory is one of his pre-Ziggy albums that contained a slew of great songs and showed us that, yes, Mr. Bowie had some great ideas. Standouts include Oh! You Pretty Things, the ever classic Changes, Life On Mars? & one of my personal favorites Andy Warhol. Solid effort. Nearly perfect, but not quite. Bowie still had a ways to go."
5,andy dylan,"Last of Bowie's pre-Ziggy folk/art/hippie albums, preparing the runway for take-off. Any album with the line 'the girl with the mousey hair' just has to be great, doesn't it?"
5,CLASSIC,What a great album from a legend it will be 40 years since it was released in 2011 not a bad track we should be in for a Special Edition in 2011.
5,"quite a departure from ""the man who sold the world""","i guess thats why they call him the ""musical chemeleon."" that departure is not neccissarilly a bad thing. this is a beautiful album, its just different. if you're looking for the punk side of bowie this is not the album your looking for. i like it though."
3,References that will make anything gold.,"Bob dylan reference, makes this brillant. without it .. oh i dont know."
5,A delightful story,I enjoyed reading this book aloud to my son when he was in the 3-6 range. It is a delightful story about the young male rabbit developing a sense of joy and pride in artistic work and taking his place alongside his parents in their work.
5,I think about it all of the time,I read this collection of stories several years ago after finding it in my college book store. It is so beautiful and crazy and the title always intrigues everyone that reads the red letters on the yellow spine.Somehow the stories in this book have never left me. I think about them all of the time. Definitely Yourgrau's finest work.
4,Long Live Uriah Heep,"I'm one of the biggest Heep fans you'll find. This band is on target with this cd, many great songs here. Classic U/H organ sounds and Mick leading the way on his guitar, like old times. Shaw on vocals is suprisingly strong, maybe the best Heep vocalist of all, he can hit any note Byron could. This band has no real weaknesses. ""Sea of Light"", and the live, awesome, ""Spellbinder"" are also must own modern Heep. I'm amazed how this Heep combines elements of the new members with all the class of the original. The song ""Between Two Worlds"" is a very powerful tune about life in the two rock eras Mick Box has been in, an instant classic. This band is worthy of much praise and support by us, the fans."
4,Good.....but,"I bought this to go over my queen matteress in my guest room. It works, it helps the cheap matteress, but I wish I would have gotten another 2 to 3 inches thickness. For everyday use I don't think this is thick enough. I may get another one to put on top of this one."
4,mattress cover,"Expandable Cover With This Soft Sleeper 5.5 Queen 2 Inch 100% Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Pad Bed Topper OverlayI thought that the mattress cover that came with this would just zip onto the pad itself. However, it came with a total cover that covers the pad and the mattress (even the thick ones). Also discovered a bonus pillow included. SURPRISEVery comfortable and just what I wanted and it also conducts some body warmth."
2,This is really disappointing,"I intend to call the company tomorrow. We received our mattress topper two days ago. The first morning we felt totally refreshed with no backaches. This morning, my husband got up and told me his back was hurting again. I noticed a big dip on his side of the bed. Well, the topper is completely creased and sunken down (he's not a big man). It should have retained its shape, as my husband slept. Reeeeally disappointed! Well, like the saying goes "" You get what you pay for."""
3,don't be misled by 5.5,"The shipment was superfast. However, I am disappointed in the density of the product, as I assumed it would be heavy 5.5 oz per sq.inch, BUT it doesn't really say so anywhere. By putting the number on the picture and description it puts the idea in your mind and just lets you assume it (subliminal suggestion). Therefore I gave it only 3 stars. It is memory foam and will do the job for a spare bed (very occasional use), but for your personal everyday use look for a better foam, because this is very fluffy, more like a glorified egg crate pad w/o the pattern. This is barely worth the $50 we paid (I really didn't need the polyester cover, but it wasn't available without it). As usual, you get what you pay for - or less..."
1,A terrible product,"Memory foam SUCKS ROCKETS! My back is in worse shape than it ever was before I tried to make my bed fit my body shape. I have taken it off my bed and stored the enormous and heavy piece of foam UNDER my bed, where it does the most good. Additionally, it smells bad because it is a petroleum based product. Not recommended!"
4,Fascinating!,"Cheryl Hill writes of a world that many of us make light of -- but shouldn't. Satanic worship is real, terrible and practiced by some of our friends and neighbors. The author has created an intriguing story with believable characters, despite the fact that they must confront supernatural evil beyond their understanding. ""Family Tradition"" is not only a good read, but an education in the horrors of occultic practices.Becky Lyles, author of ""It's a God Thing!"" and ""On a Wing and a Prayer."""
4,"Brilliant, except....",Joseph Campbell is brilliant. Every sentence he utters should be pondered for hours. This video is great except for the awful narration by Susan Sarandan. There you hanging on Joseph's every word then SMACK and it cuts to Susan and some rediculous monologue. That pretentious cretan ruins the whole series. Thanks a lot!
5,5 star Mythos,Everything Joseph Campbell has done is '5 stars' to say the least. Definetly worth it!
2,Closed Captions???,"I've bought this DVD JUST BECAUSE it was writen at its Product Detais it has CC - Closed Captions.But despite have tried it in three different DVD players, and in four different TV sets, all of then with Closed Captions facility/function, NONE recognized or enabled this usefull feature.Does anyone there knows how to enable this? Or it really doesn't have CC and the marketing just made fool of me???Thanks for any help.mario"
1,Sakamoto got lost on this one.,"I suppose every artist is entitled to a dismissible, dismal failure and this one is it for even the undeniable genius of Mr Sakamoto. As a follow up to the sublime Heartbeat, this album tries to follow up with protégé Towa Tei's also fantastic solo debut 'Techinova', using many of the same collaborators featured on that album, but here something gets lost. It certainly is slick in production terms, but I can not grasp what Sakamoto was trying to achieve here. There's no cohesion, and the listener is left grasping for more. Fortunately, Sakamoto found himself again by the time he moved on to make 'Smoochy'. This is one to skip. Even the most ardent of Sakamoto fans would not be at a loss without this disc."
4,Quick witted hero makes this an enjoyable read.,"I was totally drawn into this book from the first page. The protagonist is quick-witted and his accomplices unconventional and often quite funny. While the language does take some adjustment, it adds rather than detracts from the tone and style of the whole. I love it when I haven't figured out the ending of a book before I've finished reading the first quarter. In fact, one detail of the plot was almost a total surprise to me when it was revealed at the end. If you're a fan of historical fiction and authors like Dorothy Dunnett, Judith Merkle Riley, Ken Follett, etc. you will enjoy this book as well."
2,Confusing writing style,"I am a great historical mystery fan, and wanted to like this book so much. However, the writing style detracted from what could have been a great mystery tale. Too hard to follow, too much like work."
5,A Highly Entertaining and Fast Read,"I have always been fascinated with the Elizabethan age and this book is a terrific story set in an extraordinary era. The depiction of Sir Francis Walsingham is particularly interesting in light of the character played by Geoffrey Rush in the movie ""Elizabeth."" I generally don't read thrillers, but this novel was a wonderful read in so many other aspects."
1,"Awful, hard to follow","This book was so awful I couldn't even finish it. The author melds Elizabethan english and modern english and it's terrible to read. She takes this annoying roundabout way to describe things, I kept having to re-read chapters to figure out what I had just read and what in the world she was trying to get across. I think the story has a lot of potential, but I just go bogged down in the writing style. I don't recommend it."
1,Major disappointment,I couldn't make head nor tail of it all and got rather upset about it. What a waste of time and energy!
1,Nothing new and poorly written,"I ordered this because I thought it would enlighten me as to just who Puff Daddy is. Instead, there were no original quotes, no new revealing information. All old hashed over stuff from magazines. It was so boring and poorly written that I found it hard to get through."
4,The Harlem to Hollywood story of Sean John Combs,"This book is old and dated but it describes how fatherless Sean John Combs from the housing projects of Harlem went from the struggle of a single parent household to the genius of entertainment mogul Diddy and the Bad Boy empire. A great read for fans and anyone who believes that its not where you come from but where you are going that matters. For more on Diddy's mogul ways check out the new reality show ""I Want to Work for Diddy"". Diddy is one ambitious and hungry dude whose drive matched his dreams to create Bad Boy. Like Madonna once said, ""how far you go and how successful you become depends on how hungry you are"". Diddy is an example of that."
3,UNAUTHORIZED PUFFY,"The designed book for the causal music fan seeking some information on Puffy. The ""Real"" music fan will not find anything new. Most of the material was hashed from magazine articles. I feel that you will get more interest from Nelson George's book ""HipHop America"", chapter 9 ""New Jack Swing to Ghetto Glamour"" then you will out of the whole UNAUTHORIZED book."
4,Seminal & Subliminal,"The second full length effort by early German industrialists SPK, Leichenscrei is more of an ambient train wreck than the more concise new wave experiments they would later dabble in, beginning with 1983's Metal Dance EP (which featured the crucial addition of Graeme Revell). Interestingly enough, while the band members preferred to retain their anonymity, an insert titled ""Dokument 2"" was included in early copies of the album detailing their growing interest in multimedia presentation of their work, and encouraging listener feedback as to the success of these groundbreaking experiments. In the next decade, the commercial success of rock-based acts such as Nine Inch Nails would obscure the original intention of industrial music, which was to update the trance-inducing characteristics of tribal music into the modern age, but by all accounts Leichenscrei must be considered a compelling example to re-evaluate this artistic conceit."
4,Cheaper than buying fancy watches,"Rather than buy expensive watches with designer watchbands, I buy Timex watches and then change the straps. Voila, designer colors. Since Timex watches last practically forever, by changing watchband colors, I always have a ""new"" look."
2,Awful.,"I bought the other DVD by the same company and loved it, however, this one is horrible and repetitive to the other DVD. I expected to learn something new but it just repeated almost every word from the other DVD and in a less effective manner. Do not buy this if you already have the other one."
2,Say it by Signing,"I feel this product is okay for someone who already have knowledge in signing; but as a complete novice, it wasn't very helpful to me."
3,A funny selection,"Richard Clayderman has produced yet another suavely refined album here, with the themes from all of his favourite films. Unfortunately, while the music is beautifully played, Clayderman's taste in cinema is not nearly as sophisticated as his piano-playing. The selections include 'The Goonies', 'Macgyer- Lost Treasure of Atlantis', 'Dude Where's my Car', 'Debbie Does Dallas', 'Big Trouble in Little China', 'Porkies' and 'Howard the Duck'.Maybe next time Clayderman should do a survey of the music from somebody else's favourite films."
3,Good but...,"...a bit of a bummer since all but three of the tracks were on their previous cd Pristine Smut. SOMEONE has not grasped the concept of an ep. Suck as it may, the evil genie's plan to re-issue! re-package! succeeds thanks to the new tracks, especially la di da, which any fan of the plugged-in, poppier Murmurs is bound to fall for. They are still a good band, writing good stuff, so let's hope a hipper cover photo and a radio-friendly single bring in the profits the now-out-of-print Pristine Smut apparently failed to. Another bummer--one of the best tracks from PS, Sleepless Commotion, didn't make it into the Blender. Can't anything work out?At least it is definitely fair to say if you liked the last one you'll like this one!"
2,amateurish writing overshadows somewhat interesting content,"I found this book to be annoying in it's very amateur writing style. Isn't that what editors are supposed to help with? The content was somewhat interesting, but overall I found this work preachy and disappointing. Can't really recommend it..."
4,Good introduction to enhancing the human energy field.,"Although certainly not a literary masterpiece, it offers a nice introduction to the exercise of ""prostration,"" a Tibetan form of concise yoga. Also includes some excellent breathing exercises. Limited Buddhist philosophy. The story, though sparsely written, grows on you, and there are some nice nuggets of wisdom within."
3,Luridly entertaining but slight.,"There's a great, seminal novel in here somewhere, but it's smothered by the self-consciously (and unconvincingly) naive narrative voice and the uninspired characterization and suspenseless structure of the book. Boys of Life is a teenager's fantasia on the far-off world of arty decadence personified by Warhol, Pasolini and Fassbinder and, as such, holds enormous interest. But it fails as a novel: when it tries to be debauched, it's gross; when it tries to be mystical, it's contrived. Boys of Life is a nice effort, and held my attention, but in the final analysis it's simply a painful and too-common thing: a trivial work that could have been great."
4,This book is impressing yet a little too graphic,"This is a book that can grab your attention and never let go. The realism that is portrayed in this book makes you think that this actually happened. Almost to the point of being in Tony shoes the whole time. That alone is a frightening thought. Well, actually to do all those things in real life is disgusting and too much for any one to bare..It is good to read in make believe."
1,SICK & TWISTED,This was too disturbing for me.It is a wild story!But I recommend the authors The Coming Storm instead.
4,The same as the craft store version.,"This is exactly the same company and product as is widely available from most craft stores... without the shipping costs.The bookmark has a dark (black) accent around the edge that makes it look more ""antiqued"" than bright silver... but that doesn't show well in the photo."
4,Fish Hook Bookmarks,"This hook is really nice. I like it because it's a little larger than the hooks you find in the bead and craft stores and although it costs a little more, it makes for a very nice beaded bookmark to give as a gift."
4,Snuggly,I can't really give it stars from my experience because it was a gift to my 7 yr old niece. She absolutely loves it.
2,Bad Recording,This is an awful recording of a great musician. It's a shame that this CD has such bad quality. On some of the tracks you can barley hear Bob Singing. On most of the tracks you can't even tell that it's Bob. If I were you I would stay away from this CD. There are Bob Marley CD's that are MUCH better than this.
1,Horrible,"I own several of the Japanese imports and this is by far the worst I've heard. I'm a die-hard fan and I can overlook sub-par sound quality given the uniqueness of the performance, but this is so bad it's not worth it. I listened to it once and filed it away. If you're considering it I hope you save your $$$ and pick from any number of other quality recordings that do Bob justice. This one never should have been released and those who did should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Visionary leadership for the church,I wouold recommend this book highly. It offers valuable insights for the 21st century church.
3,scooby-doo uh-oh,"This game is ok, sure. But I thought it was waaaaay to easy to solve the game and too boring. I LOVE scooby-doo, even though I'm over 11. This game is not really a mystery, but more arcade style. You have to find trap pieces to set a trap. There are many places in an abandoned ""haunted"" fun park where you can take each character in the mystery-solving game. what is kinda cool is that you can have 4 players playing in the same game on the same computer. Each player gets to choose a character except scooby. scooby is just a helper. You find clues to help you find the criminal. You need scooby- snacks which you can find throughout the park. It is a rather large setting with many fun and creative details. You have like 5 suspects to choose from. Kinda boring."
3,A Look at The real Beatles,"Although this CD contains no music, it is still extremely exciting to listen to. The interviews catch the Beatles individual spirits and are so interesting that you won't want to stop listening to it once you have started."
3,Works well after you visit the hardware store for missing parts,"Looked at all the reviews and decided to go with the most expensive winch because of reputation. It arrived in just two days, so super-fast shipping (thanks Amazon!). It receives just 3 stars because after paying more than $1200 it had several missing parts that required a trip to the hardware store. If I wanted to drive to the hardware store I would have purchased the winch in town... No response from Warn when we sent them an email; nothing, nada, zilch. The missing parts were just a few dollars retail so you would think a company would take the time to make sure everything required is included in the box."
4,Item as desribed,"I have not had a chance to use this item yet, but so far I am pleased. If only one this, it is REALLY heavy. 100+ lbs. I suggest getting the rope instead of the cable."
3,And?????,Why do we not have the spec for the length of the winch wire cable. I need a winch with a long cable. How long is this one? What about a link to a kit to install on a front or in my case rear bumper?
2,Probably their worst,"I guess it would be hard to top yourself after you've made one of the best albums of the 20th century (1995's Afraid of Sunlight), but I was expecting a little more than this. I don't think anyone would fault the band for wanting to explore new musical avenues..but the bottom line is that the songwriting is just not up to par."
3,Not bad for not good,"If you lean towards the band for its progressive inklings you may be disappointed at the pop production, but since I rarely see anything greater offered from the overly-cited dinos, a watered down format suits, and can even be better for, bland delivery."
4,"A little hard to get into, but worth the risk","I got hooked on this album by ""Answering Machine"", which I think is simply brilliant, lyrically speaking. Now that I've listened to it more, I also really enjoy ""3 Minute Boy"" and ""A Few Words for the Dead."" Both feature one of my favorite tricks- a sudden, total shift in the energy level of the song, which many refer to as a ""power kick."" Songs that start out quiet and meditative suddenly reach out and kick you in the proverbial behind.Certainly not their best work, but IMO much better than Seasons End or Holidays in Eden."
4,Some good some bad - Where's John Helmer?,"Not one of Marillion's most rewarding albums. However when the songs are good they are really good. ""Born to Run"", ""Cathedral Wall"" , and ""Three Minute Boy"" are a heart-wrenching as you would expect from Marillion, while ""These Chains"" is fair by comparison. Perhaps Steve H. is listening to too much Radiohead these days and not the brilliance on Mr. Helmer. If you have been a fan for years you'll enjoy most of it....but if your a newcomer....get ""Brave"" instead."
2,Where the hell is Fish ? Why did he leave !!!,"Certainly a great album for Marillion but not in the Marillion spirit. Too much synths, waiting to hear some god music. When a group has one of the best guitar players in the world...why don't they use him at his best ? Steve H. is a great singer but he should know that is sings for Marillion & not for himself."
5,Brilliant !,"The best thing EVER in the H Era of Marillion !!Grab this one, or lose out on a fantastic piece of Rock Music !"
3,and isn't true,"unlike the past hogarth-era marillion albums, radiation seems very superflous, with average musicianship. as marillion fans, we are used to deep and beautiful albums such as ""brave,aos,and tse"". with this album we get really flat hogarth vocals, with hardly a hint of steve r. on the guitar. now because of the fact that those are the best qualities for marillion, makes this a dissapointment, and makes me eager for the next album ""marillion.com"""
1,¿Marillion? I'm not sure!!,"This is probably the worst album of Marillion, only comparable with songs like ""Canibal Surfbabe"". I was very expected about this but really there not high points on this. Only ""Under the Sun"" and ""The Answering Machine"" are over the rest. I'm hopping an album like ""Brave"" or ""Misplaced"" where the music form a special athmosphere and the musicians shows all this quality, in special S.Rothery..."
3,Not particularly memorable,"This is definitely different from earlier Marillion albums -- chorused guitars and lush synths are replaced by fuzz distortion and Hammond. The raw, punchy sound is informed by Brit-pop acts like Radiohead and Oasis. But while it's different, calling it ""experimental"" or ""innovative"" is pure nonsense. It's up-to-date on the rock mainstream, but hardly cutting-edge.And while I like the sound, the songwriting isn't anything special. I get the feeling that anybody could have written these tunes, though none of them are that bad. (""Born to Run"", a limp and soulless attempt at the blues, comes close.) I could do without the stupid studio chatter, and their occasional attempts to sound like the Beatles sound amateurish and superficial.In the end, what counts is whether you enjoy listening or not -- and I do. But it's nothing I feel compelled to hear again. This one is primarily for Marillion diehards."
2,A dark period in Marillion's history,"Let's say it clear, this cd is under what the band can do.The only good moments on this cd are the songs ""Three minute boy"" and ""Born to run"". A special mention also for the acoustic version of ""Estonia"", this song was available on another cd (This Strange Engine)The other songs are weak with few good moments in them. This is one of the least interesting album from Marillion in Hoggart's era."
1,Is this the definate sign of Marillion's Decay?,"I couldnt be more dissapointed listening to this album..In one word,""flat""is everything you get from RADIATION.I am a Marillion fan but how can I possibly disagree with Michelle's M Smith review.She is absolutely right!I'm still giving the Band some credit for the future..Wishfull thinking?Only time can tell.I'll probably throw this CD away .Its an insult to all of us who traveled faithfully along Marillion's side all these years..."
5,This what I call PROGRESSIVE,"Great album like all the others. Radiation is more like the early Marillion: Market Square Heroes and Script For A Jester's Tear. It's experimental and refreshing ... 100 % Marillion. And this is REAL PROGRESSIVE MUSIC. Not like all these so called progressive bands that are repeating the old Genesis, the old Pink Floyd and the old Marillion. This is the new Marillion and it is great."
3,Hammond party...,"Yes, the one thing this album left in my mind was the classic Hammond sound used on several tracks. A lot of Radiation reminds me strongly of the last album's Accidental Man. Not a bad thing, but the songs could have been better. I still regard them as a favourite band."
3,Whats With the Flat production??,"I think Marillion is a great band, besides mimicking Gabriel era Genesis in their Fish era I think they are a creative and unique band. Brave, This Strange Engine, Afraid of Sunlight, along with Misplaced Childhood and Clutching at straws are all beautiful and inspiring albums. Radiation does have its strong moments but what realy kills it, is the production. Is it just me or does the whole album sound like they covered the microphones with blankets. The drums suffer the most. What I enjoyed on their old albums especially Brave was the emaculate attention to detail and clear distint sounds and effects. The one exception where the production seems to fit on the album is the song Answering Machine where Steve actually sounds like he's singing into an answering machine."
2,"emotional, but lacking","i admit, it made me cry - but what ever happened to the lady nurse who helped Joe Enders pass his hearing test in order to be able to go back to war, and was writing him all the time? the characters are static, though the Navajos are slightly more dynamic; there was little background info. too much bombs and shooting throughout, and i especially did not like the melodramatic part when Enders killed Whitehorse along with the Japs and then told Yahzee,""I killed him. I threw a bomb and blew him up,"" acting so sarcastic, wanting to provoke and die. finally, the code language should have been featured more."
2,disappointing.......,"Shortly after the war we lived on Saipan and our father told us about the bloody battle for the island......the thing that the film never described was the way the 30,000 Japanese were hold up in caves throughout the island.....As a child I also learned about the code talkers......so it was with real interest that I rented this film......however, it was soon apparent that Woo did not have the same direction in mind.....He spent entirely too much time developing the Enders character and little time was spent with the Yahzee, Whitehorse and their training. Too bad he did not do what Kostner did in ""Dances With Wolves"" and develop other characters......who became the meat of the story......Hollywood once more underestimates the viewing audience and what they expect."
2,"Go rent it, not worth buying.........","This movie is a very big let down....I couln't wait till it came out in stores, rented it and now regret doing so. It had horrible acting, horrible stunts and a horrible over all plot. It was a very big let down to what I thought it was going to be like after seeing the theatrical teasers........."
1,"Awful acting, detestable directing, thin plot","My wife and I were excited to see Windtalkers. With my wife being a US History teacher, we expected to see an intriguing story centered around the Navajo marines who used a secret code to help win the battles in the South Pacific during WWII. Instead, we saw John Woo's version of a war movie, which happens to be abysmal. Let me say this right now - SAVE YOUR ...DOLLARS, SEE SOMETHING ELSE! By taking one for the team and spending my own hard earned money to watch this film, I hope in some way I can save many other hard working Americans their time and effort. The action scenes in Windtalkers were violent, confusing, and jumbled. They all started to look the same. I wanted more of the secret code and how it changed the war, instead of seeing guys getting blown up by mortars. In all, I walked out shaking my head in disappointment."
1,It blowed up real good!!,"I love World War II action films, but I can't tell you how much I hated this movie. There's absolutely nothing redeemable about it. From the bottom up, everything about this film is wrong.To use an analogy, this film is like a $500,000.00 home in Malibu built from clapboard, thrown away furniture crates, and discarded soda bottles.I'm not going to go into the specifics, all I'll say is that this film has nothing to do with an accurate portrayal of history, or any reality in this dimension!!The acting stinks, the actions sequences are laugable, and the main characters seem about as real as Bert and Ernie. The pyrotechnics are so unreal, I half expected that guy from Second City to appear on screen and say, ""It blowed up real good!""If I were a Navajo code-talker, or even a relative of one, I would be totally insulted at some of the insinuations that this movie makes. It's too bad that these brave men couldn't have been honored with a more accurate picture of their heroism."
2,There's a reason why you can get this DVD used for $0.35...,"Yes, it tells a story in which there are code talkers. I don't feel it comes close to really telling their story, though. It's a Hollywood, tear-jerker, war movie. Cut w/the standard cookie cutter. The film is also heavy on totally unrealistic battle scenes. It's worth the 35 cents, not more."
1,Windtalkers Bloody Horror,This movie is not an appropriate movie for teenagers or anyone who doesnt like violence or gore. Its far to bloody and gross in my opinion. Seeing some guy getting his head chopped off or people getting blown up is a sick thing to show.
2,Clichés abound.,"I like the idea of shining some light on how the Navaho language was used as code in WWII, but the rest of the movie was so full of clichés it was hard to watch. Sure the action is good, audio very good, but there are so many unanswered questions left for me. If your looking for an action film and don't mind all the cliché - lines, background music, acting, one liners, then it's great. Otherwise Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and even We were Soldiers are a much better choice."
1,Absolutely a Horrible Movie,"I had such high hopes for this film considering the subject matter. What I should have noted is that Cage is hit-or-miss with his movies, and that Woo was directing. This is 2 hours of my life I will never get back. I could spend quite a bit of time describing in detail all of this film's faults, but enough time has been wasted already. Avoid this terrible film at all costs. I wish I could have given it zero stars."
2,Alot of action but a lil disappointing,"This movie is a great action flick, and I mean that. John Woo did a great job with it, making it in the vein of his Hong Kong classics like Hard Boiled and The Killer. It is an extremely flawed film, however. First problem is the lack of realism. I think of it as a western, where the marines are the cowboys, and they shoot ten thousand indians, who are the Japanese in this situation, but only two cowboys die. While those numbers may be a little exaggerated it did bother me. A movie based on true events should give a good and realistic depiction of the events. This movie fails to do that. I would say to any Woo fan to go see it just because it's Woo. But war flick fans may wanna steer clear of this one."
1,Another Cage flop....,"Nicolas is not chosing his screenplays correctley...WINDTALKER should have been called EMPYTTALKERS. God, nothing happens here, it's a total waste of time and money. They had a good plot concept, but they exploded it."
1,So disappointing.....................,"As a fan of both war movies and of Nicholas Cage I was very excited to see this movie. However, I was left greatly disappointed. This movie is horribly inaccurate coupled with poor acting by most. Nicholas Cage seems to be able to kill 5 men with every 1 shot. Seemed very unrealistic to me..........."
2,Awful- Hambone Cage Strikes Again,"I guess Nicholas Cage isn't being offered the good scripts anymore- and for good reason, the guy is so formulaic now- the surly sufferer- that his acting range is really limited to a short list of registering basic emotions. And John Woo- what a flash in the pan this guy is. The action scenes are awkwardly staged...something Woo is supposed to be great at. The fighter planes are clearly matted in digitally. Explosions occur before guns have fired.There's so many predictable cliches from other battle films stretching back to WW2 films that you get a feeling you've seen everything before- and you have! ..."
1,Needs more Navajo talking,Why is it called Windtalkers? It only has about 2 scenes of Navajo talking. When I saw it I thought it going to have a lot of code in it. This movie should be called Notalkers!
1,More appropriate title Bloodletters not Windtalkers,"The production of this film was expensive and the talent competent to say the least. The trouble was that while the purported subject of Native American code talkers is wildly fascinating, the actual subject of the movie was extensive, profane, ceaseless blood and gore. As a Native American I am deeply disappointed, as an American Citizen I deplore the shallow perspective and as a human being I regret the time spent in watching this bloody depiction under misleading banner."
1,Fooled by Woo,"I thought this would be about Navajo ""Windtalkers"", and theirspecial contributions-- WRONG. Did we get to see how the enemy was baffled, allowing strategic success? No. Did they need a Windtalker"" to call in artillery support for their overrun position? Of course not;just give the coordinates, for godsakes! ..."
2,Inaccurate and very silly...,"John Woo: possibly one of the greatest action directors. ""Face/Off,"" ""A Better Tomorrow,"" ""Mission: Impossible 2,"" ""Hard Target."" All great movies. So why does ""Windtalkers"" stink to a new high level of stinkness? Well, it's not very exciting, it's terribly predictable, and it's just not that realistic. I must say, as much of a John Woo fan as I am, he just didn't do too well with this one. Nicolas Cage is miscast as a war-weary veteran assigned to protect a Navajo codetalker from getting captured by the Japanese. Christian Slater plays his expendable buddy and the movie flops around for a long two hours with cheery war action, lots of dying, and no resemblance to the realistic movies of recent history like ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" or even ""The Thin Red Line."" Heck, ""Star Wars"" is a more accurate war movie than this. I hope this is just a temporary setback for Woo, Cage, and Slater. They've all done much better."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I enjoyed John Woo's previous movies for what they were, simplistic action movies with exiciting action, relatively clever plots and decent dialogue. This movie is awful however. The acting is bad. The script is bad. The characters are bad. And Woo goes overboard with the battle scenes. It's almost like he watched Saving Pvt Ryan and decided that he wanted to recreate the intense and graphic battle scenes himself - which he does about 10 times during the movie. Eventually you get sick of watching soldiers hurtling thru the air with missing limbs. I struggled to watch the whole film."
1,Bloodbath,this movie was so bad i wish i had never seen it. You dont even find anyhting out about the war all you see is fighting and blood. Nobody describes what is happening in the movie. Digusting and horrible you would two of the many words to describe it. My advice dont see it. it would be the worst exprience of your life.
1,Depression Sets In....,"John Woo, who normally makes good films, should fall on his samuri sword for putting his name on this trash. Nick Cage gives a performance second only to the infamous 8MM. This contrived and predictable trash should be fed to death row inmates on a steady diet, the chair cannot compare to the torture. This Rodney King We Should All Get Along Despite Our Differences drabble made me want to vomit. Before you rent this flick, pull the pin from a grenade, put it in your mouth, then duct tape it shut, you'll thank yourself for the sweet release of death..."
1,more imperialist US propaganda,"If you think the US is the best country on Earth, is ""the home of the free and the land of the brave"" and all that [stuff], you'll love this 2 hours of propaganda.""Yes, the US should defeat the evil Japanase (and Germans) so *WE* can control the world. And to prove how honorable we are, we'll even let our Indians help us, whom we've been massacreing, cheating, and discriminating against for five hundred years.""After this film, your next neo-fascist imperial-America homework is to watch ""Bad Company"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Sum of All Fears"", and Brad Pitt's recent ""Spy Game."""
1,Windtalkers,This DVD is not widescreen . And I need all my DVDs widescreen because I have a windscreen TV. Went to Hasting all of Windtalkers DVD are both widescreen and Fullscreen.And I went back to my order from you and it show it was widescreen that was order.What happen?
2,Another War Movie????,"man, another War Movie??? what's going on.. But I'll tell you I don't care for War Movies but I'm willing to give this a shot because John Woo directs it.But John woo really lost his Hardcore Touch. After Hard Boiled, his movies are not as great or soo hard core!! His american movies are too restricted, yuck!!Come on John pull out those double handed gun action movies like the good old days!!!"
3,"Its a good movie, but the plot of Navajo's could be better..","First of all, Roger Willie is Navajo from New Mexico and Adam Beach is the only native from Canada who are the main characters besides Nicholas Cage. The person who wrote earlier saying both the natives were natives from canada, should look more into it than making a statement like that(it will discourage other natives to defend where they are from originally).Ok. To the movie now. I think the movie could have been done better than portraying the traumatized soldier from his last battle. Navajos characterize in this movie, were not given much of a chance other than say a few sentences and all about the code talk. There is much more to that. Although this is more to say on this subject...i need to go."
1,100% CRUMMY,"This movie was most disappointing. I thought it was going to be a story about the Navajo code talkers and their significant contribution to the war in the Pacific against the Japanese. It never once told why the Japanese wanted so desperately to capture a Navajo in order to break the code for them. Nor did it even delve into why this code bedeviled the Japanese. The movie mostly was just battlefield shooting, blood and guts, and Nicholas Cage and his flashbacks. Save your money on this one. Buy instead the History Channel's show on the Code Talkers."
2,Windtalker history is minimal,"When I first heard about this movie, I couldn't wait to see it. I even broke the ""let's wait until it is on video"" rule we have in our family and went to see it in the movies. Having studied the Navajo codetalker's history , I couldn't believe how minimized their contribution was in the film.Instead of a history on how this program came about, the selection of the participants or in indepth look at how they fared afterward, we get ""treated"" to a poorly filmed movie about Nicholase Cage and Christian Slater. Big deal. I kept saying throughout the movie,"" and when are we going to focus on the navajo codetalkers?"" A huge hype for a mediocre action film. Not worth your time."
3,This Should Have Been Better,"This a watchable film, however, given the subject matter it should have been more compelling than it is. Give credit to the main actors, Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach, for breathing whatever life the director, John Woo, and the screenwriters couldn't to this movie. The title of the film is ""Windtalkers"" but it may as well have been titled ""Cliched World War II"" movie. The film is more concerned with battle sequences (a.k.a. big explosions) than the subject it purports to be about. There are only cursory scenes that involve the training of the Navajo code-talkers. What follows are scenes with the platoon that consist of virtually every ethnic stereotype including the resident bigot followed by one battle scene after another. It's a shame because this film should have been so much more."
2,If you like war movies AVOID this one,"If you like war movies this is one not to get. The acting [...] to say the least. Explosions occur before the planes bomb actually hit the ground soldiers die before the bullets hit them or the bomb explodes. The planes, all digital, shrink as the flyby at times they get smaller than the actors. This has nothing to do with distance or any other factor besides poor art direction. Nicholas Cage should be ashamed of this movie for sometime. The story of the windtakers should be given more respect than what this movie trys to give it."
1,All explosion - no story,"If this movie had actually been about the Navajo ""code,"" it might have been a decent movie. Instead, out of 2-1/2 hours, about 1/2 hour is devoted to dialogue and the other two hours devoted to gory, loud battle scenes - they are endless - in this case, less would have been more. Unfortunately, instead of empathising with the characters, you become numb from watching body parts flying across the screen.The move is about Nicholas Gage's character and the two Navajo Indian characters are merely incidental to the plot. The scenes where they are actually sending code are good and you only wish there had been much more about how having the code helped win the war."
1,Not a good movie,I didn't like this movie at all because there was no character development and the battle scenes are not done to look realistic but seem to be constructed to show either explosions or men dieing in creative and dramatic ways. The movie never gripped me and it didn't to have any direction at times.If you are thinking of buying this move do yourself a favor and rent it first.
1,Theft,"I hate to be so cynical, but does it bother anybody other than me that one of the few recognized mainstream contributions to modern U.S. culture by a native American group has just been hijacked by Hollywood? Why did they have to make the star a caucasian? When I saw the trailers, I almost walked out of the movie. Then I realized that I hadn't come to see Windtalkers, but was about to see a moderately thoughtful movie. Spend your money elsewhere."
