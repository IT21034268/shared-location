3,Don't Play It Again,"You are fascinated by the storyline and cinematography. The film never gets boring. But it seems to have been rated too highly by some and too low by others. Sometimes you get a feeling you are watching a cross between 19th century porno and a morality play, but never real life. It's one of those pictures you wouldn't watch twice. But sex,violence and mystery sell. Thought the brief violence was a turnoff."
5,strange but good,"picture it...2:30a.m.,your normal everyday insominac,channel surfing, and turn on TMC and here is this weird victorian-like movie,i started to turn it but it held me for a second, i made a few comments, to myself, ""what a dumb movie"",& ""yuck coulda lived with out seeing him nude"", and then found myself crying, and realizing as the credits are scrolling,that i had to get on amazon and buy this movie.And an afterthought, if you like Sam Neil,you won't after this movie,terrible husband."
2,Pretentious,Hated this movie. Almost from the beginning I was hoping the little girl would meet some horrible end. I wonder how people expressing love for this film are just caught up in its pretentious artistry.
3,"Worth watching, but not great.","You are fascinated by the storyline and cinematography. The film never gets boring. But it seems to have been rated too highly by some and too low by others. Sometimes you get a feeling you are watching a cross between 19th century porno and a morality play, but never real life. It's one of those pictures you wouldn't watch twice. But sex,violence and mystery sell. Thought the brief violence was a turnoff."
1,It came broken,"I love The Piano movie so much and this time I bought it for a dear friend for her birthday. I ordered it on February 9th and wrapped it, waiting for her birthday. So I had no idea that the CD was cracked, the case is in good condition. Now I am wondering if Amazon will send me a new CD to replace it?"
5,"Great, my kids love it!","my son loves this little guy, he does like them better if their head is made straight,(then they can see where they are going) I know beanies are collectables,but my kids play with theirs for hours, They are practally the only kind of stuffed toy I buy for them because they are the right size for packing around, They usal;y have one in their hand everywhere they go, and they are good quality so they hold together well. my girl is 4 and my son is almost 8 and he still loves his select animals."
5,Great gift for the one you love,I got this for my girlfriend for christmas and she absolutely loved it! She said that it fits perfectly and she has had no problems with it. It's a very nice watch that can complement any clothing attire as well as other pieces of jewlery.
1,The poorest designed sprinkler I have ever owned.,"Just horrible. Leaks like the end of an open hose. The various spray selections are identical except for the mist setting. The little deflection fingers don't even reach the stream on most of the selections. It will operate at very low pressure, which is good. The only thing I've found this useful for is as a mister for small, freshly seeded areas. I would not recommend this unit."
3,I like these but they do not last,"I have purchased several of these over the past 4 years and they are my favorite sprinkler. However, they do not last more than 1 season (if that much). I like the adjustable spray patterns, the spike to keep them from ""walking"", and the ability to connect 2-3 for full coverage. However, if you use them on a 360 degree pattern, the tops will come unscrewed and pop off, flooding the yard if you're not careful. After a while, the tops come off anyway at the coverage rings even if you never use the 360 degree pattern. Seeing that I never have good success with Orbit products, even their timers, I think I will go with something else."
1,"horrible, don't wast your money","i foolishly have bought more than 1, eventually the plastic gears wear out, the head unscrews and you cannot fix it yourself. It goes in the trash. Piece of junk"
1,What a waste of money!!!!,"Well I can tell you this is a waste of money. Wish I had read the reviews before buying this great idem. Well it lasted a week before it stopped turning. I guess I could not ask for better I mean It is just a plastic POS But I,m going to make it my business to inform the world every time a company manufactures and sell a worthless piece of junk. So hopefully you don't make the same mistake as myself."
3,just okay,"I turn my faucet less than a quarter turn and it really shoots out the water. I can't help but think some of you are used to normal sprinklers and turn the faucet 1 - 2 times. That may be what is causing the tops to blow off.I've have it 2 years and it seems to be doing okay. I've seen better turbines though for less money. The ones I like is an even water drop all along the water line. This sprinkler shoots bigger drops at the end of the line on med spray setting.It is okay, if I had to do it over again I probably wouldn't have bought. Too expensive for what you get."
1,Not Worth The Plastic They Are Made Of,"I bought 4 of these 3 weeks ago. Now, all but one has died, and the remaining one is leaking. They look cool, but they are absolute pieces of crap. I should have read the other reviews and ratings. I was replacing my old Rainbirds.... but they are all now back in service. If you want something that lasts for several seasons, buy a sprinkler with a brass rainbird head. If you buy these Orbit things, buy several, and you might make it thru one season."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,I have two of these and they lasted one season. Started to use them for the second season and BOTH of them had their tops pop off when watering. I had them hooked to a water timer so I did not notice it until the next day. Total waste of your money!!
1,"great, when they work (again)","Like so many other have reported I bought 7 and only 3 of them work 1 year leater. The other 4 spray but do not rotate. I have contacted Orbit via email but recived no responce from them yet. Do not buy these, if your thinking about it just thow your money out the window of your car and save your self the time and issues."
1,"Great when it works, but then catastrophic failure.","I'm on my third one in less than 2 months. I bought the first one at WalMart and within 2 weeks the top of the unit had come off and it was shooting water straight in the air. Who keeps their receipts? So, they exchanged it for me and the new one worked for about a month and a half. Then the same thing. So, I'm on the third one and it's just a matter of time. There is no conceivable way to fix it either."
2,Fabulous - when they work,"This is an excellent concept and when they work they are easy to use and have a very flexible spray pattern and easy sweep adjustment. BUT, I have bought five over the last two years or so, and only 2 are still oscillating. The others just sit there and spray the same spot. No movement. Judging from the other reviewers who state the same problem, there is a manufacturing problem with these things. You can occasionally get them for under $10 with a coupon at ACE or Sears - if you can get that kind of price they are worth taking a chance. Otherwise, don't bother. It is a real shame because they seem well designed - apart from a bad motor mechanism apparently !"
1,Bleh,"Bought 5 of these, daisy chained them together, and ran them in my front yard. After an hour of use, shutting off the water, and starting it up again, it no longer respects the set limits for oscillation. It will spin 360 degrees now, reversing direction at only one of the two tabs. This happens on 3/5 of the sprinklers.Last night I forgot to turn them off. Left them on all night, and when my wife came out, she said the tops were off of 2 of them, and they were just flooding the yard with water. Pieces of junk, avoid them at all costs."
1,Stopped oscillating,"I bought this from Home Depot. It took a little while to figure out the best setting as there was no manual included. It worked okay for about two or three weeks and then it stopped oscillating. No matter what I did I could not get it to work properly. I figured out how to take it apart thinking there was something stuck inside and I could clean it out. Everything looked okay but it would still not oscillate. I would pass this off as a lemon but after reading that many others have had the same problem, I suspect it is a design flaw. I will not bother returning it for another as I do not have any faith that a new one will work any better and do not wish to waste any more of my time on this flawed product."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"If I had written a review right away after buying this I would have given it 5 stars. Worked great- at first. But, after less than two months only 1 out of the 6 I bought continued to work correctly. The others simply stopped rotating.I took one apart, thinking that maybe earwigs or slugs or something had gotten inside the mechanism, but no luck. Now, I'm a pretty handy guy, but there was nothing inside that I could fix to get the thing working again.I will not buy this product again. I have also lost faith in this manufacturer, who continues to market an obviously defective product at consumer expense."
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought one thinking what a terrific bargain.... only worked for about two weeks before the head unscrewed itself from doing what it was supposed to do (rotating back and forth) and I found a flooded fountain in the yard. Put it all back together, and now it just sits there and wont turn."
4,great item,replaces one that wore out. wonderful product. keep buying as they wear out. will continue to use the product and more
1,Junk,"I bought the tripod version but it has the same head, mine self-destructed after 3 uses, splitting in half and shooting straight up in the air. Couldn't get it back together. No manual either, might have helped considerably but then again maybe not."
2,This Is Not A Biography,"If you are looking for a biography on Daphne Du Maurier, I would not recommend Haunted Heiress. This is a rambling, free form work of literary criticism. You would do better to check this book out from the library rather than paying the steep price.You can learn more about the story of Du Maurier's life by doing a web search.Also, if you are interested in visuals, there are none in Haunted Heiress, save for the cover. The text did conjure up some mental images of Ms. Auerbach, though... (narcissistic, cranky, and snobbish) but none of Daphne Du Maurier.I did very much appreciate Ms. Auerbach's observations on Du Maurier's affinity for the way men can live their lives, with more freedom and flexibility.I wish Ms. Auerbach would have done more research on Du Maurier's life and interwoven it with her pop-up thoughts on this book or that."
3,Ideas from Pictures...,"If you're into pottery, you'll love the various designs in this book. However, if you actually make pottery, like myself, this book is only semi-useful in that you can get a few ideas from the pieces photographed. There is very little text, and none of it is really informative on the methods used. This book is for the coffee table, not the art studio."
3,Too bad they updated it!,"This is a solid book, for all the reasons given by other reviewers, but I really wish they hadn't brought in Douglas Brinkley to update it. I hope that Brinkley's work here is not indicative of his other work, because the last part of this book--the part, I'm assuming, he is most responsible for--is pretty sloppy. One gets the sense that it was written hastily and without much care. Here's a particularly egregious sentence: ""Why a country as powerful as the United States did not take the lead in curbing the world's pollution was deemed by global environmentalists as unconscionable."" Wow. You should be embarrassed, Mr. Brinkley."
4,"A good first, but not last, primer on US foreign policy","This is a compact primer for the novice (including myself) to US foreign policy during the last 65 years. It serves as a useful starting point for identifying points of interest and it provides a reasonably good list of additional resources. Because the authors' biases are pretty blatant--whether you agree with them or not--this book should be incorporated into a repertoire of foreign policy reading material, and not as your one-and-only foray."
5,"Reads like a novel, thorough like a textbook","From firsthand experience with Brinkley as a professor, I can attest that the information contained is relevant and very similar to what you would hear in a course on Cold War diplomacy. As I mentioned in the above, it reads like a novel but is meaty enough to use as a textbook. Highly suggested for a broad overview of US foreign relations in the second half of the 20th century."
4,"Political Science ""Textbook""","I ended up having to get this book for a class in the Introduction to United States Foreign policy, basically over the books timeline (WW2 to now).This book is a great resource and not as slow of a read as historical political books can be, providing an abundance of information in a readable way. It has been through several additions to keep the information up do date, and it does a great job at relating what has happened to what is (in the books context) happening.However, I am not a fan of the font they chose for the book, tending towards the heavy and less easy on your eyes."
3,history lite,"mr. ambrose has always been an easy target. he's overextended they say. well, after reading this pile of words, i'd reduce ambrose to a decent intro to the topic. if you'd like an overview of events during america's rise to superpower status, flip through these pages and consider his editorials lightly. the events are indisputable and his spin is helpful. ambrose is like water on a paper towel. give this book to young students who express interest in american foreign policy during the 20th century. if they indicate an interest, start pursuing other tomes, written by legitimate historians well-versed in their subjects."
3,Diversity,"This touch book has 6 countries that Stella Songbird travels to and you can press the pictures to hear the national anthem of that country and typical instruments played in that country. The countries featured are: Mexico, China, India, Ireland, the USA, and Nigeria. The activity card included has ""snapshots"" of Stella bird's trip. You press them and they tell you about the animals that Stella met in that country, how to say hello in that particual country, and adds a little melody from there. The other side has a Music Match with animals playing instruments and you match them according to the sound you hear (too difficult for small children). It's not my 2yr old's favorite, but it's entertaining. I think it's neat that it introduces other countries (though little ones don't really have a concept of ""countries"" yet)."
5,Wonderfully multicultural,"First of all, you need to have the Little Touch Leappad system to use this book. In case you didn't know!I thought this book was very cute! It is about a bird that travels to different countries (China, Ireland, India, USA, Nigeria) to find her tweet. In the end she discovers her own tweet is just fine.Each country shows muscial instruments and animals of that country and also the flag. If you push the flag, you can hear the anthem and ""Welcome to (country's name)"" in English and the native language. I myself learned a lot--I think this book is a good buy because it is fun and informative.One last thing--this is excellent if your child is Chinese American or Indian American. It gives a good depiction of those countries and help them be proud of their heritage.The only down point is the pages crinkle and that damn ""GO"" button!"
2,LAMINATE THE BOOKS!,"I think the idea for Littlefingers LeapPad was great...but those ingeneous engineers made one flaw...they need to laminate the books. Or at least put the pages on cardstock! When I bought my daughter the system for Christmas, it came with a book and it was just paper, but I assumed that it was like that because it was the book that came with it. Then, I bought this Songbird book and it was the same way. The pages are easy for my daughter to crinkle and chew through. She's just learning about books and teething...not a good combo. So I really think they need to put some people on their design team that have infants and toddlers. What were they thinking?!"
3,Too many satellites too little sensitivity,"I ordered this to help in installing a new 5 LNB DirecTV dish. What I found is that there are apparently so many satellites up there now that I got lots of indications before finding the proper DirecTV location. The sensitivity of the Meter is too wide to be of any use for other than initial location. I could not do the necessary fine tuning in three dimensions other than the old fashioned way using the TV and as a result several of the HD channels do not come in well. Even at the low cost, it really didn't provide enough assistance to justify the purchase."
2,Toothless Tiger,"Although the book contains a few memorable passages, (mostly gleaned by reading between the lines), I had hoped it would be a more personal and revealing look into the personalities and special relationship of these two intriguing people. Instead, it really proved to be a how-to book of golf lessons, of which there is no shortage. Quite a few photographs for diehard fans of the fallen king, but overall it's little more than a venue for Earl to beat his chest and tout his remarkable parenting and teaching skills."
4,Good Book,"In Pete McDaniel's, Training a Tiger, Tiger Woods shows you basics and in depth steps to golf. This book will show you how to start a your child in golf, equipment, putting, short game, driving, practicing, and in to mental mechanics. The authors purpose for writing this is to show young kids how to golf. It is worth reading if you want to improve your golf game or your childs."
2,Watch Tiger on TV - don't buy the book,"This appears to be a book rushed into print by Earl Woods and a ghostwriter, written just around the time of Earl's bypass surgery. The book is very shallow and doesn't address any of the interesting milestones of Tiger's golf development. Nor does it deal with any interesting personal issues - i.e. how did he deal with losses, how did he relate to his peers in school, etc. I would not recommend this boo"
1,Too Funny,Apparently Earl did not reveal all the Training Secrets in this book! This book should be reclassified and remarketed as a Comedy book. Just like Tiger will be remarketed. Too funny!
5,reply to reader with no brains from June 17th 2003,"This moron is a jealous racist. Everything he said is wrong. He should know what he is talking about before he speaks. Earl never asked Tiger to go golfing with him. The only way he would take him is if Tiger asked to go. Tiger is Stanford educated, insanely rich, the best golfer in history, never been in trouble and calls his dad his best friend. I would give anything to be sure my kids were half the person Tiger is. If you read this book and got nothing from it I feel bad for your kids. By the way he is the best dressed person on tour!!"
3,Conquest of America,"Good, but not comprehensive. There was nothing about Columbus, Cortez, Pizarro, etc. It only covered Coronado, Hudson, St Augustine/Fort Caroline, and the Russians in the NW."
5,Another Great Muppet Classic For ALL Ages,"If you like the Muppets, you don't need to be reading this review. Just buy this classic Muppet movie. If not, I'll try to give you a glimpse of the great show this really is.All the Muppets have just got out of college and now all leave for different destinations and job. They all split up, but Kermit tries to get them all on Broadway meanwhile with their show ""Manhattan Melodies"". My favorite scene in this film is when Miss Piggy is spying on Kermit and another lady Kermit is talking to. Kermit gives a hug to her, and Miss Piggy, who is being teased by some contstruction workers bend a bar of metal and then starts denting metal. It's really hard to explain, but it is absolutely hilarious. You have got to buy this DVD! I also recommend ""The Great Muppet Caper"", ""The Muppet Movie"", ""Muppet Treasure Island"", and ""Muppets From Space""."
5,THE MUPPETS ROCK!,"I saw this movie, when i was a child, about 14 years ago.I looked everywhere for a long time trying to find it on dvd.Finally, thanks to amazon i found it! very cute, funny and good family entertainment for the whole family.i'm 23 years old, and i LOVE THIS MOVIE! perfect for anyone who likes comedy!way to go jim henson!"
5,Terrifically timeless!,"The Muppets Take Manhattan is the last big-screen Muppet adventure from the late, great Jim Henson. It follows the gang graduating from college and trying to take Broadway by storm with their musical ""Manhattan Melodies"". After extensive self promotion they soon realise that breaking into showbiz isn't as easy as it might seem.The third of the Muppet movies sees it's second release on DVD video. This newer release includes a nice interview section with the Muppet mastermind himself, Jim Henson. Apart from the wide-screen picture, the interview section is the best special feature on the disc.The soundtrack is presented here in mono (did the original cinematical version have a mono soundtrack?) so audio digital remastering wasn't necessary.Nevertheless, another fine addition to the Muppet DVD collection."
3,Muppets Take Manhattan,"""Muppets Take Manhattan"" is another entertaining outing for the characters, although not quite as much fun as the first feature. The DVD provides moderately good audio/video, but nothing much in the way of extra features. For the low $19.99 retail, the disc is still worth a look."
5,I am 11 and i still LOVE this movie! i recomend it to every1,"This movie is funny, cute, and one of the best i have ever seen!! I think that the whole family can watch this, from ages 1 to 101. EVERYONE will enjot this movie. It is the best ever!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! :o)"
5,3 reasons why you'll love this movie,"The bear says ""waka waka"". The frog gets the huggies from white girl. Bert and Earnie make special appearance."
1,At least wine improves with age.,"Are all these other reviews of the same movie???I walked out after 15 minutes back in 1985, and I would have walked out today, except it's MY house this time.Three words -- plodding, wooden, uneven.And, believe it or not, I'm a big fan of the Muppets!"
4,Good,It arrived on time. The quality was good. I needed to turn off subtitles in the settings menu. I am happy with the product.
5,Can't get enough of the Muppets!,What a wonderful movie that the whole family can enjoy. It was a good film filled with all of the Muppet characters that delighted us from so long ago! Good plot about getting their musical opened on Broadway. I think you will enjoy it too!!
5,NYC Muppet,Who doesn't love the Muppets? This movie is hilarious and gives a glimpse of NYC in the 1980's. The NYC portrayed in this movie still stays with me to this day when I walk around the city. Kermit is the man...well frog! Every kid needs to see this movie and they will become instant fans for life. As an added bonus they will get to see the origins of the 80's mega-cartoon The Muppet Babies. I watched it with my three year old and he is now a Muppet-Man like his old man.
1,convicted killers need....respect!?!,"Blonde beach bunny Bobby Redford is at first shown as a new prisoner---though none of the long time prisoners rape him, despite Redford being a pretty blonde.Redford turns out to be the new warden---who decides convicted child molesters and convicted killers should be treated with respect, instead of being housed in...depressing prisons.At the end of the movie all the convicted child molesters and convicted rapists clap for Redford---and Redford begins to cry like a little girl!Little Bobby Redford made a couple movies with Hanoi Jane before this---and it shows."
4,Good Prison movie,"There are only a handful of good prison movies from what I have seen over forty plus years. ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Brubaker"", and ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" are three of the best. I don't care about Redford's personal politics and therefore my review is not political unlike one rant here. The story is based on a true event, and the acting is superb. My wife asked me the other day if I had replaced my VHS of this with the DVD. I realized I hadn't and I was long overdo to see this again. I immediately ordered it. The movie is one of Redford's best so fans of his should definitely see it. If you aren't a fan, then see it because it is a good drama about what sometimes occurs in prisons whether those that work in that environment like it or not. Corruption happens in all systems so people in law enforcement should not take this movie as an insult, but merely as good drama loosely based on what really happened at a prison many years ago."
5,Wonderful Wonderful movie.,A based on a true story.One man tries to make a difference to restore the humanity to the lifes of 1500 hundred men. Only to be fought every step of the way. If you ever forget why to hate republicans and their love of money and distain for their fellow man watch this movie.
3,"A good movie, but...","I liked this movie, but honestly? The main reason I purchased this film was because two family members are seen in the crowd during the polo scene. Too, it was filmed in Columbus, Ohio and other Ohio locations. It is a good prison movie, however, based on a true story."
1,Defective product - - ignore my one star rating,"The DVD ""Brubaker"" is defective and I will be returning it soon for credit or replacement"
2,Starts out great,"This movie starts out great, but the ending is kind of uneventful. Redford is so smart in picking good scripts, this script inevitably has a lot of intelligence to it. But it doesn't carry all the way through."
5,True stories ....my favorite,Robert Redford...one of my favorites. I really enjoy true stories more so than fiction. Mr. Redford gets into his charactor and brings out the best of himself. So glad that prision is CLOSED!!!!
4,Good teaching tool,I use this in Corrections History class to show the battle that Prison reformist had instituting Prison reform during the 70's and 80's.
5,Brubaker is Awesome,"I've been to the old abandoned prison where they shot the movie, went inside, and explored the place. I did this a few times just to make sure I covered the whole place. It took me a while to find a place that rented out Brubaker, but I finally found one. When I put in the tape, I expected to see some sucky movie that would bore me for the next 2 hours and 11 minutes, but I was pleasantly mistaken. Brubaker is an awesome movie. It's a battle between a man who wants to do the right thing, and a corrupt system that wants everything to stay as it was since they can remember. The screenplay, acting, story line, and emotional ties to the movie are great. I've since watched the movie about 7 times, enjoying it each time. I'm looking forward to the day that Brubaker comes out on DVD!"
4,Investor Researcher,While this book is several years old it provides a rich historical perspective of the S and P 500 companies as of that year. The book was well worth the modest cost of purchase and shipping. I plan to purchase other editions in the future.
5,Outstanding,"The sheer beauty of these quartets (& quintet) leaves me feeling as if no words can come close to fairly describing them. This CD was the first occasion I had to hear the Emersons - I can honestly say that I have never heard any ensemble play with more cohesion. They embody a musical Gaia principle - one living organism through which Schubert speaks. I know I'm a little overboard with the analogy, but that's how much I love these recordings. Highly recommended."
2,Non-stick lining is unreliable: works poorly and flakes off,"In our experience, the non-stick lining didn't work very well. What's worse is that after just a couple of months, it began to flake off into our food. I first noticed this issue when I flipped a brownie upside down and noticed there was a patch of silvery material stuck to it. Hopefully no one actually ate any of it..."
2,Not such a great pan...,"I was excited to replace the crappy old aluminum pan I'd been using for years. That was, until I'd used this replacement a few times. The rubbery things in the handles don't really hold up well in the oven. It says that the pan is oven-safe up to 450 degrees and I used it at temps of 350-400. The handles will never look the same again and I removed them after the first couple of uses. They weren't very functional anyway because they don't provide as much coverage on the bottom of them so you can't really get the grip where it is most important for pulling a hot pan out of the oven. The pan was stained within the first couple of uses and the nonstick surface isn't so great. I give it a 2 because it is still somewhat functional and I often have a need for a pan this size; however, I don't really like it much and I wish I hadn't already thrown out my old one."
4,Well done tale of disillusion and loss,"'Unless' is the story Reta Winters, a so-called light novelist who has never truly had to endure hardship or disappointment. She has lived in quiet content, satisfied that while her life is not perfect it is far from unbearable. All that changes when her oldest daughter inexplicably drops out of college and begins living in a homeless shelter, refusing her families' urgings for her to return home. Now Reta is struggling to go on with her life in a world she no longer understands and feels an intense anger toward. The story is not perfect; one or two characters are somewhat exaggerated (for example Arthur Springer, Reta's hands-on editor), and the story is just slightly jumbled at times. But the overall impression the book leaves is a good one. Shields' prose is delicate and intricately crafted, weaving an enjoyable story that moves quickly and takes hold of the reader. While it may not be the best book of the year it certainly comes close."
2,Arrives nowhere,"Unless is a book that goes everywhere and arrives nowhere. It is severely fragmented and it lacks depth and development of character. As a reader, you want to feel for Norah and understand her motives but so little and inconclusive information is given along the way that by the time the burning incident is presented, it is easy to lose interest. All the characters and events are loosely held together which impedes the free-flow of the story. The story line had such gut-wrenching and thought-provoking potential-- it was a great dissappointment too see it so poorly developed."
2,A Writer With Nothing to Write Writes,"On page 40 of Unless, Carol Shields' heroine notes: ""I won't even mention the swift, transitory reward of lemon spray wax."" Then why mention it? This is a book by an author with a contract who has no inspiration. She sits around her desk, looks here and there, and writes. The writing is fine but tedious. The subject is boring. I finally stopped at page 40. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason for this tome. If you liked Carol Shields' other books and want her to be happy, just send her the money directly and don't waste your time as she has."
2,I must have missed something,"I've been a Shields fan for more than a decade (when I first read her novel Swann), so when the library where I work got an advance reader's copy of Unless I snapped it up. I just could not get into the story or the characters. I've enjoyed other novels with less-than-appealing characters (The Good House, The Corrections, Crow Lake all come to mind). Reta and her family just didn't click. I wondered if Shields rushed through this because of her illness...."
2,I tried to read it,"I forced myself to read 66 pages, hoping it would take a turn for the interesting. UNLESS it happens on page 67, this book is quite a disappointment. Although written beautifully, it really was quite a bore."
3,Family Dynamics,"I was immediately drawn into this story. The main character's internal dialogue is the most successful & realistic element of this book. I found her easy to identify with, as if she was a real person that I was acquainted with. Her character was so well developed I found myself caring more about her as the book progressed. The mystery driving the book develops, the tension builds, and permanent looming loss threatens the family. Pre-conceived notions about her daughter and their relationship are poignantly described. Carol Shields is attuned to the anguish of a mother that is loosing her daughter to mental illness. She conveys of absolute powerlessness a parent has to help or fully understand an adult child who enters this realm. My only complaint about this book is that it pastes on an unrealistic ending that too easily resolves the issues that were explored earlier in the novel."
2,"Empty story, some good writing","Carol Shields clearly has the skill to write sentences well. Unfortunately, the story line is the book is missing until about five pages from the end. Not worth the read unless you are a middle aged Canadian writer, worried about your teen daughters, caught up in the fact that you are passive and basically unhappy with the way feminism of the 70's and 80s turned out. If that's the case, you will love this book. This book bored me to tears. I only finished it for a book reading group and the fact that I had actually paid money for all of this pontificating and nonsense which took 320 pages to write."
3,"Writing that is beautiful, a plot that is not...","Carol Shields is a wonderful wordsmith. She uses wordplay like no other author. The fact that I had to get out the dictionary a few times, shows that she has a wonderful command of the english language and sharing words with us to make us think. Unfortunately, the story left me flat. It was almost a book about ""nothing"". Nothing happened, except that we hear about the Reta's writing and her troubled feelings about her daughter Norah, who is living on the streets of Toronto, for no apparant drug problem, abuse problem or reason. At least there was a resolution to the plot, hence its 3 stars. As well, Shields uses language beautifully, but I need a story to keep me interested and entertained."
1,Pretentious Twaddle,"Well, that's it really. I had to finish it because someone else was waiting for my opinion. I found the little bits of French translation and the awful Danielle Westerman connection very show-offy. In fact the latter's name and opinions appearing on nearly every page drove me to wild laughter before I was halfway through. I thought the whole book was like very bad Anne Tyler, if there can be such a thing, and I didn't believe a word of the plot, or care much what happened to any of them. The only good thing I can say is that someone else paid for the book, so only my time was wasted."
3,Nicely written but not much in it,"Carol Shields writes beautifully using words to convey her feelings about her grieving. However, nothing really happens in the story, you feel like you're just reading her journal entries which amount to nothing. We don't see her change or evolve. I forced myself to finish reading since Carol Shields is an acclaimed writer (I didn't read her previous book Stone Diaries) and because I hoped something would happen, emotionally or plot-wise, but nothing - I was disappointed."
2,If you don't have another book better to read,"The prose is indeed beautiful as the author has demonstrated before, however this book does not have a compelling story. Yes it may be written well, but seems a bit too self involved and unchallenging. I could never care enough for the characters to feel hooked on this book"
2,Admirable but boring,"I really thought this novel would amount to more. I admire Carol Sheilds as a writer, but really don't like her writing, if that's possible. Margaret Atwood blows her away as far as I'm concerned.Unless was not as rich or as deep as I had expected. It seemed almost simple, but perhaps I'm missing the point. I did not feel satisfied or happy after reading the book. In fact, I gave my 8 copy to the local library as a donation after reading it. I would never read it again. Sorry carol...."
4,A Quiet Elegy,"Carol Shields offers a quiet meditation on the mysteries of family. Suspenseful in unexpected ways, this novel peeks into the uncertainties that haunt everyday life. The horror of losing a child (in such an unorthodox manner) and the way in which Reta and her family struggle to balance a quiet, normal life in the face of tragedy gain added resonance through the gentle, sparse prose. The novel burrows deep, and reveals its truths in tiny doses."
2,UNLESS you have nothing else to read,"Don't read this book UNLESS you have nothing else to read. There, my attempt at being witty. She was a truly gifted writer, but this book is forgettable. Characters are flat and one-dimensional. Don't really care about them, or what happens to them, at all. A good book makes you want to come back. This one didn't do that. Will try Stone Diaries next, though."
2,Not her best,"I enjoyed several of her books but not this one. First of all the plausibility--Who would not have their 19 year old daughter forcibly committed in these circumstances? I can't believe they could be this passive.Second--The feminism angle is way over the top. Third, most of the characters are poorly developed. Fourth--It's almost always a bad idea to write a novel about a writer writing a novel."
4,"It is a good book, just a hair shy of being great.","I don't mind the fact that the book didn't have a plot. If you think you can enjoy a character study, then you too might enjoy the book.However, you should be aware that the book will stall in a couple of places (but never more than for a few pages) and there will be some minor annoyances when Shields challenges your suspension of disbelief and makes you very aware that you are just reading a book.Not everyone is forgiving when it comes to art. So, in addition to being able to enjoy a character study, you will also need to be able to forgive some of the author's transgressions."
4,Wonderful,"This is one of the better books I have read in quite some time. Very womanish and interiorly oriented. The Protagonist's husband is very one dimensional and it got a little annoying that he kept going out to his trilobite meetings. There is some ranting and raving but mostly it is very low key and intense. According to Shields women are only called to ""goodness"" not ""greatness"" not only by men but by other women. This central point is demonstrated with clarity and verve but little subtelty. I liked the book immensely."
2,Unless is Useless,"I bought this book for my mother, who thoroughly enjoyed reading it on her THIRD attempt to read the entire book. My mother passed it back on to me, after she finished, and raved about how wonderful the book was. She continues to encourage me to read on, but I just can't. The beginning of the book is just plain boring. I've only picked it up twice, in an attempt to read two chapters and I just can drudge through it! Nothing happens. After reading various other reviews, I'm sure Shield's novel is a wonderful story with a beginning, middle & end, but I just can't help but fall asleep trying to finish the beginning."
1,Unless,"I read this book because of recommendations and hype. UNLESS you have all kinds of time,,,don't bother,,,however, there are a few interesting pages so if you really are curious and don't mind a bit of torture, then by all means struggle through"
2,No customer service AT ALL,"My son's ant farm was fun, although the first batch of ants took about 6 weeks to show up, and several were already dead. The problem started when we ordered a refill of sand and ants. We ordered them back in August. When there were no ants by October, we emailed, and received only a robo-response. Emailed again this month, no response. Wrote a real letter, with emails attached, and no response. That's an order form, two emails, and a letter, all ignored by Uncle Milton customer service staff. Don't bother to buy this product."
3,"The ants are fascinating, and then they die.","This is fascinating while the ants are alive. But it's hard to keep them alive and sad to watch them slowly die. They seemed to spend most of their time trying to get up and out of the thing. The small green one is fine, there is no need for special colors or larger ones. It's sort of a buy and die gift. It's sitting in the garage right now with a bunch of dead rotting ants in it.Ideally,you clean it out and buy more ants and try again with different food and water situations. But, keep in mind that it is a live pet that has to be maintained and fed.The harvester ants are very aggressive and try to escape, so an adult needs to do the inserting of the ants and the feeding. Kids just watch."
1,Dead Ant Farm,"We sent for our ants and they arrived a crazy 5 weeks later. 10 ants were alive, within 24 hours, it dropped down to 3. They were dead within a couple of days. What a bummer. It should never have taken that long to send them ants. I e-mailed the company and they apologized and said that they had already shipped another set of ants free of charge. Well, it's been 2 months, no ants. I'm afraid to see what they'd be like if they ever arrived. We'd be better off finding ants outside, except we live in a place with no ants. Would be such a cool toy if the ants actually came like they said they would."
1,Garbage,"This product is garbage. We couldn't get the ants to stay alive. The company was great about sending us new ants, 2 different times, but they all kept dying. My older son had one of these years ago and his was great. His ants seemed to live forever (so we do know how to care for them). I don't know if it has something to do with the new ones not using sand now or not."
1,Defective website,Product is useless because the website order form does not work. No customer service. They do not respond to inquiries.
1,CLOSED FACTORY,"DO NOT BUY UNCLE MILTON PRODUCTS!I purchased an Uncle Milton ant farm for my daughter on Christmas and on 12/26 she ordered her ants. Ten days later after not receiving them I sent them an email request for status. I have received no answer. Today I called their office and tried all extensions - with no answer on *any* of them (accounting, sales, customer support, vendor support)The only safe assumption is that Uncle Milton is closed for business.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR ANTS"
5,Ant Farm Galore,Bought two for a science fair project. Found watching the ants pretty interesting suprisingly! Would recommend with adult supervision for children over the age of 10 though. Filling with sand and the adding of the ants took more skill that expected.
5,Ant Farm,"My 6 year old daughter received this as a birthday present in December. We waited until April to order the ants, due to the weather. When we received the ants, we followed the directions and everything went smoothly. Now the ants have been working away for 5 days. My daughter is amazed by their work. She always gives me updates. ""Mom! They made a new tunnel!"" Since her grandmother gave her the farm for her birthday, she wants to call her grandma everyday to give her the updates. She sat and watched them for over 30 minutes yesterday. So for less than $20, this is a great product. It's very educational. Even if the ants die, as many have written, for less than $20 this has been great! We're very pleased.4 stars for durability, because I had an ant farm when I was a kid and it seems as if the size and quality was downgraded a little from many years ago."
2,"Anecdotal ""Evidence""","Jay Abraham is exalted as the most highly paid consultant in the country.It is unfortunate that this series of Audio CD's is merely 93 anecdotes by business owners. It had almost no words by Jay Abraham himself, other than as a moderator. I was very disappointed.I have purchased several quality products from Nightingale-Conant in the past several months and have to say this product did not meet their usual quality.Ironically, this program was twice as expensive as most Nightingale-Conant products. You do not always get what you pay for."
2,right-wing,"It is no wonder this guy works for the right-wing American Enterprise Institute. He is a bigot. Forwarding that there is only one line in the Koran that has to do with peace..and therefore has violence streaming through its core, oh but ""this doesn't mean all Muslims are violent""..i.e., those who are are not truly following their faith - - what about all that talk about the words Holy and War not being beside each other anyplace in the Koran? Finally, the title '...How We Will Win' is arrogance"
2,Doesn't belong between hardcovers,"In the time since the 9/11 terrorist attacks Michael Ledeen wrote many fine essays on the then current situation. The material handled here should have been one of them. Instead, he wrote this book, which is so up-to-the-minute that it will be soon be overtaken by events, and become as stale as last year's Super Bowl in a few months. ""What will happen next"" is a question that seriously dates any book that tries to answer it. Stick with Ledeen's excellent columns instead."
5,Awesome Rockin Comedy,"It's a great movie for any music fan and rockers, it makes a person want to start a band and enjoy the awesomeness of rock music!"
4,"Fish, starting over again, big time, naked drummer","Lost that big one in the 80's...Drummers are to rock as spinach is to Pop Eye.So then there was Internet video of the band and the naked drummerand yahoo, they are Googled.In the studio laying down tracks and shooting riffsoff the new songs, they are rocking.Will they get there? Or fall over their drums and twist their anklein anger? It's a volcano that that is about to erupt."
4,fun movie,"This is a great movie. Fans of the Office will love Rainn. He does a great job as a middle aged guy who isn't quite ready to work a real job and still has some unfinished business when it comes to playing music -- something I'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to. I think it does a good job of showing the excitment of putting a band together, when you think anything is possible, even though the fantasy is almost always better than the reality. Funny cameo by Pete Best.Music is actually pretty good. If the metal songs had been released 20 years ago, they would have been hits. Fun to look back on that stuff now that we don't take it so seriously."
3,Rainn makes this movie,Decently funny. Rainn Wilson is the key reason why this movie is funny. If you like to see 'never beens' get their due in a funny movie this one is for you.
2,A REAL Metal movie would be nice,They are always cheesy with crappy music....like this one....but it did have a few funny moments.
2,DECEPTIVE!!! BEWARE!,"OK,the trailer,movie packaging,etc.does NOT mention anything about the fact this is almost a ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL-esque"" movie!..love Rainn Wilson AND his character in this film,HOWEVER its FILLED with cheesy teeny bop rock numbers that quite frankly BLOW!..this could have been a much better movie had they gone in a different direction,such as..oh I dont know..cutting out the teeny-bopper BS!!!..IF you are a REAL rocker..steer clear or you'll be pissed!..I was totally deceived by what I THOUGHT this movie was really going to be!!WHY RAINN WHY!????..I KNOW you noticed the cheesyness of it all!!!"
1,Torture,"Love me some Rainn Wilson, but this is excruciatingly bad. Literally one of the worst movies I have ever shut off after 45 minutes, up there with ""The Wicker Man"" in terms of filmic disasters. Like the icy winter wind, this blows. What the heck, Dwight, might as well strike while the iron is hot, huh? Wilson should thank his lucky stars that he is part of a superb sitcom, because this would've been a career killer otherwise."
2,Horrible Album,"AWOL One in my oppinion, is phenominally suckorrible (that's right) on this album. The only reason it gets TWO stars is because of Daddy Kevs' beats struggling to pick up the slack from this rappers' boring and monotonous rhymes. Maybe this is just where I draw the line on my underground West Coast appreciation, being from New York. My mind is incredibly opened to this kind of stuff, but this album has nothing to put it. If it were free, I MIGHT throw it on my computer. So no, I wouldn't even pay $.95 for this borefest, like it goes for on this website. I think THAT just proved my point."
2,Really bad! Stay away! It's not too late!,"I bought this cd only because of the sticker on the cover that said ""scratches by d-styles"". I should not have let my love for the scratch pickles sway me. Awol one CAN NOT RAP! He sings, kind of like a broke down Everlast. He sounds like some cheesy white dude who is trying to be down. Maybe some people like him."
5,perfect for homemade hot cocoa,I ordered 2 bags of this last Christmas. One for me and one for my friend that packages hot cocoa as Christmas gifts. We both loved it! My daughter managed to use them up in less than a month. I will be ordering more...and sharing!
5,mini marshmallow,This product was exactly what I expected it to be. It was just a little costly to ship (but I do live in Hawaii so all shipment is costly to Hawaii)but still worth getting.
4,Good Tea,"It's nice for a tea. However, it would be better if the individual bags had a stringy thing attached to them to make it easy to take the spent bags out of the pot. Still, one of the better teas I've had."
3,Bitter Bite,"This Yorkshire Tea, whether brewed 5, or 4 minutes as suggested on package, has a bit of a bitter edge to it that some of us do not like! 3 minute brew is good, but seems to me not quite as good as P.G. Tips, which is deep in flavor, and more smooth and bright."
5,BEST with milk,"This is the tastiest tea I've had, especially with milk.If you like tea made properly, you'll enjoy this brand."
5,Yorkshire tea is simply the best.,"Yorkshire tea is the only tea allowed in our home. It is a proper U.K. tea, and while our household is all U.S. citizens, each of us has spent time in the U.K. and do know our tea. We would not be without it. Shipping was fine and on time. Well done."
5,Sureal - a feast for the eyes,"Some movies are made to be lived ... this is one of them. A feast for the eyes, sufficient to be transported in another world."
5,Another nice pic...,Once again a very nice pic by the same director.I have several of his films and they all are neato!I hope this is at least 20 words...
5,Amazing and Visually Stunning Picture,"I had to watch Kagemusha twice to really appreciate it. The first time I was more obsessed with my computer and missed key parts, the second time I enjoyed it thoroughly. The use of color and photography is amazing and considering how low the budget was, Kurosawa did a very nice job. The story of a Japanese lord who dies and the clan who pushed a thief who resembles the lord to take his place. Of course, he can only live as long as the clan finds him useful. Great movie."
5,As Good As It Gets,"If you're a fan of classic Japanese film, this is a must for your collection. The Blu-ray rendention is gorgeous, even projected on my 8-foot HT screen. If you've never seen this film before, you'll love it's classic Japanese themes, beautiful costumes, epic scenes with thousands of extras, and of course, the fantastic Japanese cinematography that you'd expect. As the saying goes, ""if this is the sort'a thing you like, you'll REALLY like this."""
4,A typical ploy of medieval Japan based on real facts,"By using real historic characters like the renowned Takeda Shingen, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, Kurosawa proves once more that life is usually more dramatic than fantasy, as he recounts the substitution of Shingen with a double during the ""golden-age"" of Japan's civil wars in 16th century. The characters are very well presented, there are some fine scenes in this colored film like that of Shingen's double galloping in front of the Takeda army during an inspection, under the eyes of the enemies' spies, or that of the sad field of battle of Nagashino where the Takeda clan was finally destroyed, but Kurosawa has streched the film a little bit longer than necessary, putting more than enough combat scenes in it. Although technically sound, I think it can not compare in freshness and powerful images with his older works ""The Throne of Blood"" or ""Seven Samurai""."
3,Blu-ray transfer is problematic,"The film is what it is and other reviewers have done an excellent job in reviewing why this story is worth telling. I bought the blu-ray version hoping that it would give new life to the 1980 film, which I saw in the theater when it was originally released. But blu-ray cannot make the print more than the print. The graininess is played up by blu-ray enough that it is distracting. The print that Criterion worked from shows its limitations.No need to get the blu-ray, if HD quality is the goal. Given the quality of the film print, the DVD transfer is sufficient.I wish it were otherwise."
3,One of Kurosawa's best films.,"I had Kagemusha for several years on VHS, before going exclusively DVD. I remember Kagemusha as one of Akira Kurosawa's best movies, in my opinion, second only to Throne of Blood. I was awaiting the delivery ofthe Criterion edition of this movie with great excitement. It was a letdown.Be warned that this is the mutilated Francis Ford Coppola version, and not the original one!Almost the whole magnificient battle at the end of the movie has been cut. As it is not violent by today's standards, one can wonder why? And while the quality of the movie is OK, I had expected it to be much better.One can only hope that one day Kagemusha will be issued in a complete version, so we can watch this movie in all it's splendour, and the way Kurosawa wanted it to be."
4,An epic film of Japanese history,"Those costumes are awesome and the number of extras is like an American film from the late 50's or the early 60's. This movie is my third Akira Kurosawa film : he is a classic director. We find that the (matchlock) muskets that are probably Dutch in origin are important in 1575 in Japan.The theme is about a double who is like a ""ghost"" or shadow warrior, taking the place of a dead great warlord for three years.For his blood and guts style that one expects, this movie is very ""clean""and as a result maybe slower and less of the realism that one might have expected from this director?"
1,This transfer sucks,No matter how I set my screen or set up the player it's impossible to see the subtitles completely. Not worth the expense in BluRay either. Get the DVD and save some money.
1,kagemusha,"Like two other DVDs I bought at the same time, I couldn't play this at all. NEVER AGAIN will I buy DVDs from Amazon."
3,More Kurosawa rubbish....,"Having viewed a number of Kurosawa films, I am struck by how often they are highly touted by foreigners, but really, they are nothing but a lot of overblown nonsense (even the Japanese public thought his movies were terrible, and they thought 'Godzilla' was a good flick!). Ridiculous overacting, unbelievable plotlines, lousy editing, all are Kurosawas' trademarks. I will grant the filming is to a very high standard, but who cares, if the story is a complete turkey? The problem is that Kurosawa never knew how to direct actors, only scenes. The fact that a number of excellent actors worked with Kurosawa and produced splendid performances (e.g. Takashi Shimura in 'Seven Samurai') had nothing to do with Kurosawa, but were more a happy accident. 'Seven Samurai' this ain't!!"
2,Okay,"I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran"", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about ""historical"" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no ""ugly"" shot in either ""Ran"" or ""Kag"" - merely that there are more ""authentically Japanese"" films out there to choose from."
5,Absolutely amazing.,"Bjork's gut-wrenching performance puts her far ahead of *anyone* I've seen come out of Hollywood. She lived, breathed, and died Selma. The songs pulled from the world around her make me stop and hear music now in the clatter of a truck or the scuffling of a shoe. The simplicity of the dance, the real voices in the songs, the jolt of the camera make this all too real, very moving, and hauntingly memorable. If you can handle the emotion - see it again."
1,"Painfully dull, the camerawork is irritating as hell. Think ""Blair Witch Project""","I couldn't even get to the end of this movie, it was so irritatingly dull. THe camerawork is... ""artsy""? It made me feel sick. Evidently the ending was worse than the first half so I'm glad I didn't finish it. I'll just stick to (some of) Bjork's music and avoid ALL of this director's work."
1,A senseless waste of 141 minutes!,"It starts like a boring and uneventful home movie. Then it breaks into a musical for no apparent reason. And just when you think it can't seem any more amateurish, her neighbor steals her savings to buy his spoiled wife a new couch? This is a great example of how ""different"" has inadvertantly become equated with ""good"". Kevin Smith is different and good. Films like Memento are different and good. This is different and a waste of time."
1,Purely Putrid,"If I could have given this movie negative stars, I would have. The music is horendous. The howling of my dog is a more soothing sound that listening to Bjork's squaking. Bjork reminds me of a bug-eyed stark raving mad drunken fairy on crack. I liken this movie to watching paint dry. Actually, I think paint drying has more of punch than this movie does."
5,"Superb Bjork, Had Shed Our Emotions....","Away from Bjork the super singer, I truleyand honestly must say that after I'd watched this film someyears ago, I'd have to say that why Bjork wasn't even nominated for best actress in the Academy Awards for 2000?Her stunning Oscar-deserved wining performance was rarely to see once in a decade or so. I can compare the intensity of the viewer's astonishment to Bjork's performance as to Marlon Brandon's GodFather performance regardless of the two stories.I don't want to spoil the movie events here, the film is simplein its main events, has nice songs, but, the film is dramaticallyeffective and goes deep into your emotions...becasue of Bjork.Whether you like the story or not, the songs or not, definitelyyou'll adore Bjork's existence in the story telling, and dramawith a stellar acting.I urge Bjork to do more acting projects as she has another artistic level has to show to us.I can rate this film 10/5 stars...not just 5/5 !!"
3,Great Bjork music video - poor film,"This movie at first thought I liked. The actors were good, Bjork does an excellent job, and the story itself was fair. The more I thought about the awful direction though the more I disliked the film. I bought the DVD just to add to more Bjork video collection but I doubt I will suffer through this film one more time. The camera work I guess was supposed to be life like and give the actors room but to me it was a headache and a cop out. When camera work becomes so noticable that it is a camera bobing up and down, it is no longer lending a life like quality to the film. Perhaps I missed the point. Anyway... this film is generally a love it or hate it affair. I am in the middle."
2,Russian Novel * American Musical * Dead Film Editor,"This is the kind of movie that you'll feel you should like but you wont. Why? Because the story and the acting are excellent. They both have a very ""authentic"" feel, but the pacing of the movie is slow and jerky. The movie plot itself moves at a decent pace but the individual scenes felt like they needed an editor. But what's worse is that you can't get into that flow of the movie because the ""musical"" scenes come in at such a different pace it's jarring. Then there's the touching main character. Selma is your ""die on the cross to help her child"" kind of mother, but one who makes choices in the movie that are so stupid it give the movie a fake feeling. Anyway, my wife and I cried at the end, because it really is a good story."
2,A Failed Experiment,"I very much wanted to like this film. The premise of a single-working mom who is going blind finding relief from her harsh reality through musical-number fantasies looks to be an intriguing extension of the cinematic musical form; alas, it is rendered trite and annoying to me by mediocre and uninspired song-and-dance numbers and one of the most self-indulgent and shrill performance I've yet seen: Bjork seems incapable of emoting with restraint, either grinning idiotically or blubbering hysterically. There's acting, and there's overacting. Sorry folks, but I'm personally glad she's sworn off doing any more films."
2,I want my money back!,"If it wasn't for the fact that the Beatiful and exceptionally talented Bjork was in this movie I probably would have turned it off after the first 20 minutes. As it was, I could only stand to watch about 45minutes before i had to leave the room. What I want to know is why Bjork? She is so cute and makes her own paper clothing, and makes really dope music.This movie is tortuous and dark (as the title alludes to) and painfully drawn out. I think that if I ever find the guy that wrote and directed it I would have to kick him in the shins and ask for my rental fee back.I love Bjork, but could not recommend this movie to anyone that I wanted to keep as a friend. Don't see this movie. Don't pander to this type of childish, trying to be too cool drudgery. It's not just that the story was painfull and sad, but I felt that it was formulaicly designed to be irritating and I have no time in my life for that."
1,Excruciating....,This is without a doubt the most unpleasant movie I have ever seen. The jerky filming style made me physically ill and Bjork is a horrendous actress. It feels endless and the songs are so poorly written that it you won't recognize them if you hear them again. Please spare yourself this wretched experience.
2,strangely disappointing,"I went into this with very high hopes. I'd heard so many great things about it, and hey, it won the big prize in Cannes, right? But it was just SO depressing. Now, I like a good two-hanky weepy as much as the next gal, but I felt Von Trier was not just mean to his characters, but also to his audience."
2,Bjork's Gives Good Game,Bjork gives a very solid performance in her film debut despite her odd British Cockney Norwegian accent portraying a Czech immigrant. You will have to suspend belief in other ways since there are numerous fantasy sequences where the participants break out in song and dance and the plot does stray from a conventional storyline which you could call challenging but is also confusing and unbelievable. If your a Bjork Fan you will probably like the movie better.
3,Disturbing & Depressing...,"First off, this has to be one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to a person that is overly emotional. It takes you on an emotional roller coaster-directly to the bottom. There are no, and I repeat *NO* happy scenes in this movie, and the few bright spots are dampened by other things, which I cannot say or it would ruin the movie. Despite that, Dancer in the Dark has spectacular acting, as well as some of the best songs yet from Bjork. You really do get caught up in the acting. The film looks like it was shot with a home camera ala 'Blair Witch', but it is remarkably smooth looking, without making you sea sick. I do not recommend the movie to anyone who does not like dramas, but I heartily recommend the soundtrack!"
1,making people cry is easy,"What starts out as an innovative, fascinating variety of ""musical"" loses all earned credit as the movie tries every trick in the book to wring as much sadness out of the viewer as possible."
2,bjork is very good,"however, i didn't find the story very good. i thought most aspects of the film were quite good, but i felt the story was rather slow and degenerates into a melodramatic mess towards the end. i am not a bjork fan, but she was remarkably good in her part."
1,"Love Bjork's Music, but this FILM is a DUD!","Short and SWEET: We all love Bjork's music, but this failed movie/musical is very poor. Buy her music or especially her DVD ""Volumen"" of music videos..... but RENT this DVD just to satisfy your curiousity, but be warned, you will not be moved by this film (ACK!)."
2,You have got to be kidding,"Boring, totally unconvincing, and badly acted with the worst ending since Al Pacino fell out of his chair in Godfather 3."
1,I truly wish I had not watched this depressing film,"Dark Dark depressing film. Be warned. It stays with you, and I wish I could erase it from my brain."
1,piece of dreck,"this was the only film my wife and I walked out of last year.We can endure alot , but the constant camera movement started making us sick. This is an unrelentingly depressing movie.The factory where Bjork works makes the one in Schindler's List look like a summer camp. I kept waiting for Bjprk or one of her co-workers to accidently put their arms under a drop press during one of their inexplicable dance numbers on the factory floor. In addition to the strange subject and wobbely camera work, the movie features bleached out color and inept editing."
4,Advice to Julia Roberts: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!,"I was annoyed by the camera work of von Trier's ""Breaking the Waves"" so I hesitated before renting the ""Dancer in the Dark"" VHS. It is a great testament to this film that I was transfixed for 2+ hours despite the annoying camera technique and the tunnel vision of the ""modified to fit your televison"" video format. It was the editing and camera technique that prevented me from giving 5 stars. Someone was wise enough to suppress the movement for the musical numbers, some of which, I confess actually made me giddy. It was brilliant to transform Selma's antagonists into smiling, singing dancers during the musical numbers.My first thought after the movie took the form of advice to Julia Roberts: DON'T SEE THIS FILM! You'll have to return your Oscar. Of course it would have been scandalous to give it to Bjork, wouldn't it?"
1,This isn't quality AT ALL!!! ON ANY LEVEL,"I loved Breaking the Waves..I love Bjork;Catherine Deneuve...sorry if my spelling is incorrect!..However, this film is stiffly acted, BADLY acted actually.Because the dialogue is so simplistic/limited there is no REAL character development. I found the whole film to be ludicrous.A real shame as it had such potential to be both innovative and moving; just as Breaking the Waves was.Incidentially, Catherine Deneuve looks absolutely leaden and foolish in the ""dancing"" scenes when the film moves into a musical...reminding me of a music video...number.I am thoroughly disappointed. I am shocked at so many positive reviews.The music incidentally was also ridiculous. The lyrics are innane, the music barely tolerable.Less talent exhibited here than in a student film at a third rate art school."
1,unwatchable,"but somehow i managed to wake up for the dancing numbers, which were different and interesting ... and Bjork does a lovely job ... but the movie is tedious, empty, devoid of reality at so many levels, a void that is replaced by nothing, an emptiness that is shattered by trite, repetitive dialog and repetitive points. Oh, please, fast forward through the movie and watch the songs, because the movie itself will make you yawn so hard you'll injure your jaw ..."
1,"lucky he had bjork - 5 stars for her, 0 for the plot","I hated this film, mostly because it made Bjork cry, real Bjork-tears, and it seems to me to be such a waste or something that she poured so much of her heart into that role in what was essentially a silly movie with several extremely flimsy plot constructions, and carried it off with such incongruous beauty when it was all I couldn't quite do to ignore the stupid plot and the wierdass Bollywood musical sequences. The final scenemade me feel ill... At the end I was torn between snapping the movie disc in half and storming out of the house or just sitting on my brown couch in a state of shock. The couch won, dammit."
4,Distracted by her dirty teeth.,"I'm not usually the type to be distracted by small things but the state of bjork's teeth put me off her amazing performance. Honestly, don't know why she has so much plaque, there's not excuse for it.Apart from that, well-directed, moving, exceptional film. The most-touted ending was shocking and expected. Bjork was brilliant in the role as were all the actors/actresses."
5,Poetry Inspiration. A true Reality.,"Bjork's film overwhelmed me. This is my favourite film. Because it portrays real life. Not in the fairytale way. Though it's ending is haunting and <sad>, it is real. It's what would truly happen in reality not in Hollywood.I've always viewed Bjork as a confident, organic soul, but on this film she is humble, fragile and absolutely beautiful. Bjork really fits the character and this film is just so emotional. It's believeable, though by reading the plot it seems a bit cliched. This film is spectacular. I'm sorry but you are going to have to Watch this. Even if you hate Bjork's music. She is excellent as an actress. Far better than any other film debuts by the other divas, this kills Whitney's Bodyguard, slaughters mercilessly Mariah's Glitter and crucifies anything Madonna has done. Bjork -you are a true artist. (...)Haunting...You'll be writing your own ""Selma Songs"" after watching this."
4,An art house melodrama that will leave you crying ...,"Im not a von Trier fan - usually his films are too cerebral for their own good. However, here he surrendered himself to the melodramatic story, and made one of the most heartbreaking (and disturbing...) films I've ever seen.The story is quite a cliche - An almost blind women, tries to save money for a surgery for her son, and of course she finds trouble on the way..What make this almost silly story so affective is the fact that all characters are extremly human. I dare you to watch the last scene without crying!Bjork's acting is a bit amateurish, and can become annoying, but she has a certain naive charm that makes you love the character inspite all. Catherine Deneuve is great and her cool style balances Bjork hysteric acting style (almost...).However, this film continues Von Trier sadistic tendency of taking a bright-eyed, lovable heroine and abusing her so much that you feel like a sadist watching the film...."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"My description isn't as long or deep as everybody else's, but here it is. This movie is so inspiring. It has wonderful music. If you want to see a good movie that's really worth seeing, then watch Dancer in the Dark. Watch it if you are ready to think you will die crying. It is soo sad, but the message(s) it's trying to get across are very well made clear. I think for somebody to not like it, they have to be crazy. I can understand not liking how it is depressing, but anybody would have to admit that it is a very very very good movie. Well produced, unbelievably well acted. Bjork is the best! Her music is so touching. When she sings ""I've Seen it All"" I could feel the whole movie audience lapse into sadness. People were crying from the very beginning of the movie. Watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Very effective, but for what purpose?","I thought this film was very well done. The hand-held camera worked for the material, making it appear like a home movie. Bjork did an excellent job playing Selma, and the supporting cast was also very good. The song and dance numbers ranged from mildly interesting to emotionally wrenching. I don't think I've seen ""Favorite Things"" done any better. The film definitely had its intended effect of leaving you emotionally drained at the end, but after reflecting on it, it seemed just an exercise in filmmaking technique than something that will stick with me. There just isn't much to think about here. Still, it was a powerful experience and worth the time."
5,Dancer in the dark,"Bjork is as extroardinary in her acting as she is in her singing. This movie is really one to soak in. The movie consist of twist of reality(documentry form) and fiction. The transition between the two becomes more evident from mid-point on. The movie is quite ordinary as your watching, but, it will pull you into Selmas' surreal world. For anyone with high emotion, keep a box of kleenex next to you, because this movie will take you on a rollercoaster ride! Bjork is awesome in this movie"
5,Best acting I've ever seen,"Let me start by saying that the plot for the movie is somewhat unbelievable and a little hokey. That, however, is made completely irrelevant due to the acting on the part of Bjork. Bjork does not play the part of Selma in Dancer in the Dark, she IS Selma. Very few performances have ever brought me to tears, but this was one of them. This is an extremely depressing movie as well. I felt like a worthless human being for several days after watching this movie. The way the movie incorporates the musical numbers is just amazing. I don't want to give away too much, but the song 107 Steps was just so mindblowingly amazing. The DVD is also loaded with special features which are really good. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
2,When Directors Attack,"I think it's safe to call this one a disaster, though the musical sequences nearly save it: Bjork is a great performer, and Von Trier has more fun with artifice than he'd ever admit to his cinegeek minions.Unfortunately, the ""book scenes"" are predictable and manipulative--and Bjork is really difficult to watch when she plays the character, particularly in the intense moments. Von Trier pushes her straight past method acting and headlong into what can only be called ""snuff""."
2,"Weird, weirder, weirdest","This movie is another example of what I think of as a farce: a filmmaker, desperate to make something &#65533;different&#65533;, laughing up his sleeve at those who rave about it. The plot was a real stretch....many of the issues presented would never have happened, even in 1964, when the movie took place.This was one of the most depressing and ludicrous exercises in filmmaking that I have ever seen. Frankly, I cannot believe that I watched it until the end! I could not believe that the cast broke into song and dance when they did.....even on Death Row!!!! Even if these were fantasies to allow Selma to cope, they were so out of place!The other annoying aspect was the shakiness of the hand-held (I assume) cameras which cut off the top of actors&#65533; heads and were sometimes out of focus,among other things.Bjork was the one shining light in this film. She did an excellent job as the naive,nearly blind Selma, desperate to keep her son from the same fate."
3,Bjork Makes This One Worthwhile,"Dancer in the Dark as a stupid plot that is self-indulgent in a juvenile way, but the movie is worth watching solely for the performance of Bjork as Selma. What a pity she is not making any more movies!"
5,Intense.,"This is one of those movies that will take you by suprize and hit you hard. It's tough to watch, but it is impossible to see the entire thing and feel nothing. It will affect you in one way or another. The beauty of the songs, the musical scenes, and selma will be enough to make you feel like a better, changed person. Go see it...it is bee-yoo-tee-ful!"
1,Contrived tear-jerker,"There's some parallel between Dancer in the Dark and Pennies from Heaven - both have lead characters that are frustrated in life and then unjustly accused of murder; both characters escape into musical fantasies when they cannot face cruel reality. Pennies from Heaven was a masterpiece; Dancers in the Dark is not. The choreography of the dance sequences of this film is primitive, and the songs instantly forgetable. The main character Selma's emotions appear contrived and superficial, as she tries to hide the facts about her son's operation and her landlord's bankruptcy. If the landlord hasn't stolen Selma's money, there would not be much drama at all.The great injustice here is that this film received the Cannes Festival Award while Pennies from Heaven is mostly forgotten."
1,Terrible Product,"very disappointed in these topiaries. I bought them for either side of the front door. However, they were not as expected. There is a wooden rod in the center which completely shows through the greenery. In addition, at the slightest wind, they fall over. It is an outrageous price tag for something the average person could throw together with items bought at Michael's."
1,"American Yodeling,1911-1946","I can't review this, because I still haven't received it yet.Am anxious to get it as soon as possible.Since I had to put a rate I just put the 1 star, but I knowonce I get it I'm sure to love it. I love the Yodel musicElsie"
5,"Buy, read, laugh, learn!","This book hits a nerve and the funny bone at the same time! I've never laughed so loud! These guys have almost too much fun with an otherwise dark and scary topic - the ""Nuptial Netherworld""! Every friend I've recommended it to can't thank me enough. Everyone - man or woman - should get this book and then personally thank the ""Professors""!!!"
1,This book is for immature jerks only,"I consider myself a regular guy who likes to watch sports, go golfing, hang with my friends, and have a family. This book is about the same kind of guy, except they've pushed the family part out of the way.I'd bet most of the guys that can relate to this book are divorced, or in a miserable marriage.I thought this book was just plain stupid."
2,Not a serious aid to relationships...,"I bought this book after hearing the authors on the radio. I bought it because my brother was thinking about getting a divorce, and thought this book may help his understanding of his relationship. The authors ideas on maintaining a releationship are poor. If you have to resort to the simple tricks, half truths and cheating mentioned in the book, you may as well file the divorce papers now because the tricks won't last long.There is some humor in the book, and it is an easy read. If you are looking for a book to help your marriage, this is not it."
1,Very disapointing.,"I don't believe a ""mommy"" was involved in writing this book.It was written by 2 men and I would never go for marriage counseling to them.I think that ""trying to understand what it's like to be and to feel as a mommy"" would help ""the guys"" much more than following the ""advice"" that was given in this book.To obtain free time, the authors recommend to invent an imaginary friend the husbands can go out with and if ""the guys"" feel they have too much on their chores list, there is advise on what to do to make it even shorter.This book is supposed to be taken as ""humorous"". For true advise on how to have a fulfilling marriage after having kids, choose another book!"
1,I wonder,"""Don't Give to Charity - How Free Handouts Create Viscous Circle of Victims""Viscous ? viscous adj 1 with a thick semi-liquid consistency; not flowing easily. 2 said of liquid: sticky.Now are they being punny, or maybe they mean ""Vicious"" in which case I suggest somebody proof reads before publishing. Getting the title wrong would appear to be a pretty big no no.I haven't read this so don't take this as a review, but I will continue to give to charitable causes I deem suitable."
1,Too expensive!,"Go and buy Twin-labs ZMA Fuel on bodybuilding dot com, does the same thing at a fraction of the cost."
4,Good Product!,"Enjoyed using this product, definitively helped at the gym in strength and endurance. It's not very strong, for the true bodybuilders would be good to use combined as a pct."
5,"Works, BUT watch it for wrong amounts in the 21 count pack.","Okay, this is about the product: It WORKS. Im seeing results, more strength, and more pump. I stak this with M-Stack. The point is, watch out for the wrong number of packets when you receive this. I was doing the math and counting the packets I have left, and instead of 21 packets i received 19. Could be a factory error but please check and count when you first open them. It will make it hard to follow your cycle. IDK how to contact amazon LLC to complain."
1,I haven't noticed anything,"I had high hopes for TEST after reading all these reviews so I took 2 straight cycles of this. I just finished the second cycle and i haven't noticed any difference. If there was a difference then it was so minimal that I couldn't tell. Also, keep in mind there is no testosterone in this. It only has ingredients that raise your natural test levels. Maybe it works but not for me"
5,Product + hard work= awesome gains,"I would recommend doing three weeks on, take a week or so off, and three weeks on. Im on my second cycle and am loving it. It took a few days to kick in. Im seeing strength gains and as i am getting stronger I am also leaning up. People say I look huge but I still weigh the same. Dont look at the scale, its all about body composition. Stack this product with Creatine and Protein and a good workout schedule. Get about 5 workouts in a week, get that 7 hours of sleep, and a good diet and this product will definitely get you even bigger (muscle mass). If you have any questions just email me. I also like that CONCRET creatine with any protein. You must run as well. Developing the circulatory system will help your body recover faster. I love to do intervals (run hard for 90 secs jog for 45 sec) and stairs...I hate it but i also get about three 4-8 mile runs in a week. Beast in the weight-room that can also out-run the skinny guy...haha"
4,Good stuff but bad smell...,"I would have gave this product five stars but the smell when you open the can is a bit strong, but easy to swallow. Did feel pumped may have a placebo effect but I am a skeptical person anyways. I would try a range of test boosters and see what fits you but this one seems to hit the spot."
1,Didn't do much for me,"I like Universal products and got great results from them all especially M-Stack, but not so much with this one. The only result I got was extreme hunger which is a good thing if your trying to bulk up. Other than that I saw no results. Most of the people on here did and I am not saying it is a bad product, just wierd that I got nothing out of it. The pills gave me bad burps and a wierd taste in my mouth, almost like a fish oil pill."
4,Short cable,"The cable is too short for much of my work. There is a 6 foot cable extension available from Minute Man Electronics (530) 271-0400) or direct from Philmore Manufacturing #44-404. There is a minimum order or $20 from Minute Man and the cable is only $2.99, so you can get a half dozen for the $20 and make it 36 feet long if you wish to."
2,Bait and switch,"Although the cable is a bit too short for my intended use, it works, which is about all one can say for a cable release. It is worth ten dollars.I found this item on Amazon.com through an outside vendor for $9.99, put it in my shopping basket and hit ""Buy now with one-click"". Later when I looked to track my package, I found I was being being charged $26.95. When I called Amazon to complain, I was told that it was because I used one-click feature. That is quite an expensive convenience.I am fairly satisfied with the merchandise, but consider this a rip off, and my opinion of Amazon has dropped considerably."
4,How much can you say about a USB cable?,"This cable was just as advertized. Connectors were well molded and the cabled just worked when used. Some USB cables are kind of stiff, but this one is pretty supple."
2,nothing to do with Honduras,"I looked it up on Wiki, and O. Henry spent at the most 6 months in Honduras, probably less. There is no evidence he spoke Spanish. So unless he were a prodigy of some sort, he would not be expected to learn or experience much of the real country during his short stay. And this book bears this out. There is nothing of Honduras in this book. It is unfortunate that the reader might conclude that the book arises out of some actual knowledge or experience of the country, or sympathy with its people, because that is decidedly not the case. And the author butchers what spanish he attempts. For that matter, the author's english is often absurd. Didn't Graham Greene's travels to Mexico result in works of enduring value? It's a pity the same can't be said of O'Henry in Honduras."
5,"Great buy for the money, around $10","Sheffield item #: 12838Liner locking blade, 2.75"" clip point blade, partially serrated (1""), 10cm closed length, 4.355oz/123.4g w/ clip, lanyard hole in handle, thumb studs on both sides. Coated blade, rubber grip handles, adjustable pivot bolt. Removable pocket clip is stiff and sturdy. This knife is elegant and streamlined when closed. Upon close inspection the blade appears crude and ugly, but sharp and sturdy.Rough machine grinding must have been used to shape the raw steel during the manufacturing process because little grooves can be seen that run perpendicular to the edges. That's what I mean by crude and ugly. This knife is probably meant to be a rugged, hard used work knife, that can be easily replaced if lost or broken. I bought mine at Home Depot for under $10 and consider it a very good purchase. Don't pay more than $20."
4,Working man's knife,I bought this knife because it was cheap and looked pretty good. It shouldered it's way into being 'my knife'. This is a great tool. It is underpriced for the quality I see in it. Handle has rubbery inserts that make handling it safe and solid. The blade is sharp and stays sharp. Tough steel.
3,Okay... I suppose... :~\,"I suppose this knife has its uses. Although I am very downhearted at the fact that this knife was not of use to me in categories I wished.First, it is a poor foot-peeler. I have tried on multiple occasions to scrape the decayed skin from my bare heel. I was utmost aghast when I tried to scrape my foot with this product. You see I was very eager to put this new blade to work, as one can imagine, but it just did not live to the expectations. *exhale in melancholy*I have had the pleasure of owning and using other knives, and those have worked perfectly fine. I've been able to tend to my feet, and after other knives, they are as soft as a baby's bottom. (warning, do not use on baby's bottom; injuries will arise)The reviews for this product do not suggest that this tool be in any way unsatisfactory, but I suppose you never know things for a fact until you've tried them yourself.P.S. The black things on the bottom came off and now it looks terrible now ugh D~:(sorry mom) ~a y n"
5,Sleeper Film Mixes Comedy And Tragedy,"Director Robert Ellis Miller (""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter"", ""Sweet November"") has crafter a film of exquisite comedy and bittersweet drama. Anthony Edwards shows a new side contrary to James Bond and Anthony Edwards is more vulnerable and funny than in any previous showings.Based on a short story by David English and Barry Gibb, two terminaly ill men decide to live life to the fullest instead of waiting for the end. What ensues is a marvelous road trip full of unexpected comedy, antics and wonderfully touching loyalty and love. The story is fully believable and the ending is so bittersweet, you'll be in tears - but happy ones.All music written and performed by Barry Gibb (of the Bee Gees) including some large UK hits, ""Childhood Days"", ""Moonlight Madness""."
1,Average metal in a time when average metal is terrible.,"I have a lot of difficulty maintaining an interest in this CD. I heard two of the songs on the website and then heard a copy of the cd and i did not like it very much. The guitar riffs seem to be stolen off of wannabe death metal bands that play at local clubs every weekend, the lyrics are average at best, and the drumming is all muddy double bass and no style. Maybe this band will get better with time, the potential is there."
2,Disappointed,"I've owned the Treo 650 for a better part of two years. The first six months was nothing but a struggle as the poorly designed PalmOS crashed repeatedly and ""hard."" As a person who has owned a Palm III and Palm V and loved both, it looks to me that the PalmOS is on its last legs, and is showing its age. Multitasking isn't available, and little things like receiving a text message while on the phone confuse the thing.It tries to be a PDA, it tries to be a phone. It excels at neither.This will be my last PalmOS device. There are better designs and more modern software out there on other platforms.Jeff Hawkins' ""Zen of Palm"" is truly RIP with this device."
1,Doesn't live up to the hype!!!,"I purchased the Treo 650 in March. Several weeks after I had it it began freezing up. I received a replacement phone, it ended up doing the same thing. I received a third replacement phone, same problem. Avoid this phone and along with it the headaches."
1,"Functionality is Excellent, Implementation is Horrible. Crashes, Freezes, Needs Rebooting Constantly!!!","I bought this phone 5 months ago, and fell in love with the functionality. I've used a blackberry, a SE P900, SE P910a, you name it. This device is excellent.BUT it has a fatal flaw. It's absolutely not stable (think Windows 95). It crashes constantly, it will randomly freeze. [...] How about having a device that DOESN'T cash.I know lots of people have bought this phone, and some are happy with it. For me, I gave up with the phone and it's now being sold on eBay to make room for a different phone."
1,Worse than unreliable,"This phone is great when it works. My first phone worked for 4 months, the second for one month, the third for a day. Cingular blames Amazon, Amazon blames Cingular. Eventually, it will be out of warrantee, and I'll be stuck. I would not buy a cell phone from Amazon or Cingular again."
2,DEAD Phone,"I tried Treo with Cingular but it kept on dying on me. When i went back to the salesperson he saw the same thing happening. How strange is that?Finally I gave it up. It does have some cool features. My fave is that I can have a directory with picture-enabled interface. I can also download some games which makes it cool too.But the fact that it dies on me all the time--then it wasnt worth it. I dont think so. When its dead, what's the use?"
1,Does NOT WORK with Vista 64bit,"I have a Treo 650. I just bought a new laptop that came with Vista 64bit. Little did I know that NO PalmOne product is compatible with Vista 64bit and they (by the words of one of their customer reps today)are not working on a fix. Now I'm going to have to buy a new phone if I want to be able to sync. More and more new systems are shipping with Vista 64bit and many people are caught unaware of this fact. Please know if you buy this phone, it will not work with Vista 64bit as of the date of this review."
1,Cell phone,"I've had this phone for a little over a year. Never got the promised rebate. It died. ATT refuses to fix it. Only solution is to buy a new one. Yeah right! It is a pitty but ALL US cell phone companies are the pond scum of American business. I've had a cell phone form the start of the technonlgy,1984, and ha ve had several carriers. All dishonest."
1,"Unbelievably bad phone, but at least it's expensive","I was a happy Cingular customer with a nice Sony Ericsson smart phone. No problems at all with network coverage, phone performance, or anything else.The I got this Treo 650. What a mistake. I now have a two-year contract for a phone that works only intermittently. On days when it decides to work, the reception is poor compared to my old phone. On other days, I must reboot several times to get it to sustain any kind of ability to receive calls."
2,disappointed,"I love my treo 650 but am highly disappointed with it. when the phone is not in use it automatically cuts itself off, when a call is coming in it will turn itself back on but not in enough time to catch the call, it's a big headache working in the field as a technician. I'm hoping there is something else offered by cingular as a solution but at the same time I'm considering just going back to the raz. It's not worth the headache!"
3,Buyer Beware ordering this phone from Amazon.com,"I placed my order on Feb 21st and it has since been delayed twice. About a week ago, a rep told me that my order got messed up. The email assured me that it would be shipped by March 23rd (Today is March 22nd and my order still has not shipped).They even offered overnight shipping for free. Wow, but that doesn't help considering I've been waiting for almost a month.I don't believe I've ever waited this long ordering anything online before.If you can be without a cell phone for 4 weeks, then by all means order from Amazon. If Amazon takes care of this matter, I'll be sure to post a follow up to this review."
2,Bulky and keyboard is small!,"I've had this phone for 10 days and I am returning it. I can't seem to hear well on this. Cingular hasn't dropped any of my calls (as promised by the adverts) but it does tend to fade at times where I'm asking the other person, ""Huh?? What did you say??"" I had a T-Mobile Blackberry 7100t phone and that phone is a ROCKSTAR compare to this Treo. Even my bluetooth headset doesn't work well on it. I had to stop using the earpiece and put the phone to my ear, which I think is VERY, VERY uncomfortable. The QWERTY keyboard is too small for my fingers and I'm always mispelling words because my finger will the next key. Unfortunately, T-Mobile doesn't work well at my new apartment so that's why I had to disconnect.I give it a 2-star for the sleek look and design though. It also syncs up my Address Book and iCal to my Mac. Looks like I'm going to Verizon Wireless now!"
1,no end of glitches,"I am a computer guy and figured I could deal with some of these problems, but this product is totally untested and the companies distributing it have no idea what they are doing. They will keep replacing the phone a few times at tremendous cost to themselves, yet won't fix it. This is my 3rd Treo and it still doesn't work. After the latest firmware update, things are much better except the SIM card now keeps turning the phone off."
4,Great PDA Phone,"this phone does all I ever wanted: contact management. I tried the 8125, and the Sidekick. Both were a waste of time. Warning: if you have a Palm-based PDA and you are going to U/G to this of the 700(w/p) remove the old palm software first. Just trust me. OK the only reason why I give this 4 not 5 stars?1) the sync cable should be USB 2.0...period!2) the speakerphone is the worst.3) no flash on the camera.All are minor but need to be stated."
1,The worst phone ever,"The Treo 650 is a great connected PDA, but it does not cut it as a phone.I have been using my Treo 650 with Cingular service for quite some time. When it comes to using it as a regular phone, it is the worst phone I have ever owned. The quality of the line, the number of dropped calls and the user interface are all significantly inferior to any other phone I have used.If all you care about are data services and / or PDA functionality, go for it. If, you mostly need a phone, go for another device."
2,Palm Treo 650,"Love/Hate this converged device. Great device for gadgeteers wanting googleMaps, bluetooth to GPS receiver, opera web browsing, and imap4 or pop3 (chatteremail) email client over global GSM network. Poor device for phone service, generally wedging on weekly basis, with recovery requiring soft reset/reboots. No bluetooth voice dialing with standard headset kits."
4,Great if you are a geek!,"There are so so many features that accompany this device. It would take the average person months to figure it all out. I basically use the phone and the memo features. I do not have the time to spend on all of the other stuff. You must have some type of wireless device (bluetooth) because the phone tends to get rather heavy after holding it a while. You must also enable the key pad lock on the phone when you are on a call or you will get disconnected by accident because your face has hit the ""hang up"" touch screen. I think it is a great phone if you really need or are going to use all of the features."
1,"Poor design, Does nothing well","Phone is a big disappointment. Call volume at its highest level cannot be heard outside. Many of the features work at the lowest level, for example camera pictures are barely viewable.So as a phone, you can barely hear the call outside, as a camera you cannot see the pictures very well. When you take the cover off of the back, you cannot get it back on.Overall: does everything, but nothing well!"
3,"If you have the TREO 600, DON'T UPGRADE","I have retired the 4th Treo 600 due to device problems, freezing, loose headset jack, and bugs in the software causing an orange blob to move across the screen.The 650 takes some getting used to, but freezes like the 600. NONE OF YOUR 600 ACCESSORIES WILL WORK WITH THE 650. I had to buy a new case, car charger and cradle for the office. I now have a box of 600 accessories that are useful with a broken device.FORGET ABOUT CALLING THE PALM SUPPORT CALL CENTERS, THEY HAVE A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AND A LACK OF TRAINING WERE OF LITTLE HELP.I would wait until the TREO becomes more stable and they build more reliability into the product."
2,Pretty Disappointed,"I bought the Treo 650 from Cingular about a month ago and they replaced it three times and the third one still doesn't work properly.- With the first phone, the phone would shut down for no apparent reason. Versamail wasn't working correctly either.- With the second phone, phone quality was very bad. In fact, to make or receive any phone calls, I had to put the speakerphone on in order to hear the calls.- With the third phone, same problem as the second phone, but now I don't seem to have service in a lot of areas, including my house (and I live in Manhattan).Other than that, I loved the Treo for all its functionality. It's kind of big for my taste too. I mean, you can put it by your belt in the office, but in late hours or in clubs, you wouldn't want to do that. I returned the 3rd phone. I just couldn't take it anymore."
4,Lacking but great!!,So I've read all the reviews and still got the phone. I've got to say I've not had the problem of not being able to hear anything at all and the signal has been pretty reliable even though I'm not in a large market like Dallas or Houston. (i'm actually in Oklahoma for school) Though I've gotta say it's lacking on a few programs and media playing software for playing videos and also WiFi capability. Otherwise all in all it's the best of both worlds and great use of both a PDA and phone.
3,Great PDA-Phone needs a little work.,"I had had a palm for many years and I decided to get a combo pda/phone to reduce the number of gadgets I carry. The treo 600 was not tempting but the treo 650, I thought, had everything I wanted. The screen is immaculate with all the applications fully using the colors well. I have not issues whatsoever with the PDA side. For the phone functionality, the headset jack induces a lot of static. I have tried 2 different wired headsets and will try a wireless bluetooth one later. The speakerphone is fine if you are in the office or at home; however, if you are driving, it is barely audible. Keep in mind I have had this unit only 5 days now. I am hopeful Palmone will resolve the issues with the phone portion."
1,Whatever,"The T-mobile Sidkick 2 is ten times better. Comfy and easy.Pda screens or very easy to break. Push on that screen to hard and in a few months it'll be ruined. It's happened to me, anything that accidentally presses against the screen will srew it up.The sidekick has a flip cover that protects it and offers more."
2,Nice Try,"This phone doesn't have enough memory so it can't do everything that it should. Unless you want to spend many hours managing memory, buying expansion cards, and learning what applications can work on expansion cards, wait another year for a better model."
3,Be careful,"You are probably better off buying this phone from a cingular store that will give you better support. If a serious phone problem comes up, amazon doesn't seem to provide much support like a store will.I've had the phone for 6 months:1) The PDA functionally is great.2) Phone volume is chronically too low.3) Phone reception is worse that what my roomates get with other phones. (They use the same Cingular service.) I added an external antenna to my phone so it would work in my room reliably.I think it's one of the best pda+phones on the market. I just wish palm would make the phone functionally better.Also, I don't like being tied to a single phone company for 2 years. If I were to buy the phone again, I would probably pay extra the unlocked kind that work with any company."
1,phone riddled with too many issues,"This phone has too many issues and should not be on the market. It crashes, it often develops dead speaker syndrome (DSS), meaning that you have to use a headset because the normal receiver speaker doesn't work. Your other alternative is to use the speakerphone, which means you won't have any privacy on your phone conversations."
4,Really Great for a upgraded desk,"Nice fan was a replacement for one of those ""cheap"" desk fans this one looks great on the desk thanks"
1,Terrible Ripoff,"This DVD of the ARMS concert at the Royal Albert Hall 1983 was a real disappointment, the transfer was absolutely horrible and must have been made from a VHS tape. I have a laserdisc from the mid eighties that looks 90% better than this travesty. I didn't look at it until this weekend or I would have tried to get my money back. Don't buy it unless you have no other way of getting this wonderful concert event. The concert is amazing with the best of British Rock all playing together. Where else can you see all 3 Yardbird guitarists together? Too bad the transfer is so bad. Grainy, dark overly contrasted piece of crap."
3,A Rare Treat......and a Few Flaws,"The other reviews are dead-on in their comments on the relative merits of Beck vs. Page abilities; and its pretty obvious that it was a strain to their egos to get them both on the same stage. Jeff Beck and Steve Winwood DVDs are hard to find, so if you're fan of either (even for the few songs) it's worth the price. Eric Clapton gives a great performance but the sound mix leaves you straining to catch his guitar above the other instruments. Another annoyance was the ""third drummer"" who mugged shamelessly and whaled on every piece of percussion - tambourine, cow bell, gong, drum rim shots, etc. - Eric, Charlie Watts and Kenney Jones can all be seen rolling their eyes at this over-the-top performance."
2,POOR QUALITY VIDEO,"The audio is very good but, the quality of the video was terrible. Not worth the $$$ I paid."
4,Almost worth every penny!,"So the video quality isn't so great. The sound is acceptable and the content is excellent. Also, everyone on stage is a little loose and messy with their playing. But it really just adds some character to the liveness. Just seeing all these guys on the same stage together makes this a worth while purchase. Any true fan of Guitar Gods should own this DVD."
2,"Content great, DVD quality sucks",Can't complain about the concert. This DVD is a very bad copy from either VHS or a Laserdisc. Very dark and the sound has some sort of limiter that clips off any low volume content. Hard to enjoy this fine music with this version.
4,At Live Show in LA,"Have seen show live and from DVD, Was lucky enough to get 11 row seats at LA Cal show, was awesome , watching DVD brings back memories, Have to agree Page was Sloppy, But he always is or was onstage, In LA Page and Paul Rogers(Bad Co.)worked together thus creating the band (The Firm) Page was much better in LA then London shows, I would say he was still effected by the passing of John and his addictions, but was a good show, But hey Jeff Beck blew them away and hearing him sing no wonder he just lets his guitar do the talking"
1,"MISSING SONG, THAT'S ADVERTISED","I purchased this CD attempting to find a certain song, and the song isn't on the CD after I purchased it. song#8, Fully Committed by the Artisit: Kingdom. I don't know if this is a mistake or a misprint. I need that song. Would you please attempt to find that song for me. If you can't I would like for you to send me the proper information so I can return the CD that I purchased."
5,LOL,I bought this book for my brother who was going through chemo. I first read it myself in bed one night and my husband kept waking up from my Laughing Out Loud. It was a book you don't put down. It was the perfect gift for a cancer patient.
1,Bad success rate,"Even after trying the CDs on different burners (one burner even being on my sony vaio) I only get about 1 out of every 10 to actually burn completely. I even tried different programs ranging from free iso recorders to programs like Nero and SONIC. Granted I do not burn CDs often, but I consider these CDs still not worth the money."
2,Purchase at your own annoyance,The last time I purchased this item 43 of the 100 CD's would not write. I had to mail (at my own cost) the ones that would not work back to Sony and wait for replacements to be shipped back. This is simply not worth the savings of a few bucks when buying CDR's. Do yourself a favor and choose another brand.
1,File in the circular file,"I was somewhat pleased to see so many other reviews say that the success rate of these CD's is poor. I thought I was doing something wrong, or needed to do change my settings, but if others are having the same problem, then it's an easy decision - into the garbage they go..."
4,broken case,"quick, free shipping. the only thing that bothered me was that with this being a Christmas gift and the case where it was supposed to lock closed was broke in shipping."
1,Amazon's lack of customer service,Sony 100 pack of CDRs is an excellent product but Amazon's customer service is abysmal. The product was poorly packed next to a very heavy item inside the same box. The CDR case was cracked open with probable damage to a couple of CDRs. Amazon's online instructions are to post problems with packaging in a special section and post a photo of the damage. Did so immediately. Waited a couple of days---nothing. Reposted the message and photo and waited a few more days---nothing. Apparently customer service means little to Amazon.
2,About 5 % Get Errors,"Using Nero, about 5% of these CD-R disks generated write errors. That seems unacceptably high."
4,GOOD PRICE,WE ORDER THESE FOR THE SOUND ROOM AT CHURCH THEY ARE A MUCH BETTER PRICE THAB IN STORES AND THEY ARE OF GOOD QUALITY
4,men with baskets on heads annoy gay icon truck driver.,"Imagine 250kgs of extra mature cathedral city, smothered in a layer of puree'd stilton, rolled in cheesy wotsits and stored between the toes of an unhygeinic giant. Well, this film is cheesier.Thing is, that's the beauty of it. The stunningly cliche'd one-liners flow from the lips of Russell with a poetic ferocity that would leave even Arnie in a state of quiet awe. When the mulletted Kurt drawls ""it's all in the reflexes"" you know he's right, and unlike todays movies you know he's not being ironic.Jack Burton was born ready, were you?"
1,Amazon Unbox is an awful venue.,"Movie is fine. We wanted to download to watch at leisure. The downloading glitched part way through. Had to stream it 'live' from Unbox. Not what we wanted to do. And, Unbox charged me TWICE for the movie: once for the glitched download attempt and once for the 'live' stream. Ridiculous! Won't be using Unbox again."
1,Am I the only one who thought this sucked.,"I loved ""Buckaroo B and I loved ""The Thing"" and still love Mr. Russell -- thus I thought the talent combo would produce a classic. It took nearly 20 years to finally getting around to seeing it. Sorry, guys, I don't get it. I didn't enjoy it. Didn't have fun. It just plain stunk. The Goonies were better and that's saying something."
1,pathetic,"Im sorry, but when the flying ninjas with huge baskets on their heads started showing up, that was enough for me. This movie has no entertainment value whatsoever. Its movies like this that give good actors like Kurt Russel a bad name. Go ahead, say that this review wasn't helpful, but this is still an awful movie."
3,Blu Ray not-so-HD,"This is one of my favorite flicks. Sadly, I'm coming to a conclusion that most blu ray disk titles don't have a transfer that is any better than the DVD. This looks pretty much exact to the special edition DVD release. Based on my experiences with other Blu Ray titles, this is actually better than normal. Movies like Stargate and Total Recall blu ray disks, in my opinion, look WORSE than the DVD copy."
3,Lame commentary track,"I've actually owned this DVD for more than a year now, but I never bothered digging into the extras until recently, and I have to speak up on something. I have always loved BTLC -it's a great film that doesn't take itself too seriously and Kurt Russell was perfect in his role. Buy this DVD if you want a nice, remastered DTS soundtrack and a widescreen aspect -both are excellent. However, the commentary track leaves a lot to be desired. Better than two thirds of the duration of the film, all they did was turn down the volume and ramble on amongst themselves about film school theories and their careers. THEY HARDLY EVEN DISCUSSED THE FILM! What a wasted opportunity. The few times that John Carpenter actually makes any commentary about the film, he giggles and laughs his way through the scene under scrutiny.I'm glad they had fun making the movie, and it's wonderful that John thinks it was all a giant joke, but bring something we don't already know to the commentary track, please."
3,What a guilty pleasure this movie is.,"This movie is nothing but pure fun. It's a parody of kung-fu movies with some sci-fi thrown in. It never takes itself too seriously (but don't tell the characters that). Is it a great movie? nope, but it's so entertaining, who cares!"
4,excellent screenwriting tool...,"Dare I say even more fun than the Indiana Jones films, simply because this had what that did PLUS a lot of laughter. Working from the same script blueprint, blowhard trucker Russell is thrust into the Chinese underworld of San Fran and encounters one amazing moment after another. Yes, many didn't ""get it"" that Kurt was doing a John Wayne imitation, and a great one at that. But the great twist was, in Russell's own words, the hero and sidekick are actually reversed. Dennis Dun is the physical wizard, while Russell macho-talks and blunders his way through the proceedings. Nothing like a script that can be original.So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart already:). Just a friendly tip, a great place for screenwriting tips on how to submit is queryletterclinic.com which has a sample query letter, software, and a huge list of production companies."
4,A cult classic adventure,"What can say except this may be John Carpenter's best film. Well done and very entertaining in every respect. Not for young children. Great martial-arts scenes, frights and comic relief throughout. A very few cuss words, including one F- bomb, should not prevent most over-12 viewers with parents from watching."
5,I love this movie!,"I have a few guilty pleasures and this is one of them. I'm not sure why I like this movie so much, but I really enjoyed watching it and decided it was finally time to pick it up on DVD.Plus I got it for $2!This is probably one of Kurt Russell's lesser known movies, but that does not make it any less entertaining. I find the story to be pretty intriguing too."
5,Classic,"Goodness, how many people today can make movies like this??? First time I saw it I was probably around five years old. Twenty years later, it's even better. Lo Pan is such a incredible yet silly villain that you can't help but admire him. The action scenes in here are also a treat to see, especially the wheelchair scene. I am proud to have this DVD part of my collection.For some, this movie might be cheesy - lots of 80's movies would be considered cheesy today, but this is truly a good movie for its time and it still has its charm today."
5,How can such a silly movie be so scary and so good?,"I have long loved Blazing Saddles by Mel Brooks.Somehow both of these films set a tone where anything can happen, all rules of logic are thrown out the window, but by the time the credits roll, you somehow end up caring about the characters.Big Trouble has earned a special edition DVD and makes good use of it. While I would like to have seen more behind the scenes hijinks, (you know with this crew there must have been alot of cracking up on the set) what is on disc is very interesting to see.This is probably a movie that I will be in the mood to see about once every five years or so, but I'm glad I own it. You never know when some dark and stormy night is going to encourage you to enter the weird wackiness of Jack Burton & company."
5,Classic John Carpenter,"I loved this movie when it first came out and the love affair starts all over again. I have watched VHS copies of this over the years and now the DVD is unbelievable. The DVD transfer on this movie is incredible. Tons of extras and a fun movie who can resist that? Can I compare cheese such as this to wine? Lets try. This movie gets better with age, Jack Burton, like a fine wine, gets better with age. A must in any DVD collection."
4,Simply entertainment,"When you sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that it's simply for entertainment. It's not about kung fu (though there is some of this.) It's not about special effects (though there are some of these.) And it's not about Chinese history, culture or philosophy (there's certainly none of this.)It's a comedy, about a swaggering loud-mouth who's way out of his league, dealing with supernatural powers that he can't begin to fathom. But with determination - and some help from his friends - he makes it through.From this point of view, Russell pulls off a great performance. Jack Burton is a terrific character, and Russell portrays him perfectly. The other performances are also strong, and the writing is lively, making for a fun movie."
5,I WOULD GIVE IT A HUNDRED STARS IF I COULD.,"This has been my favorite movie for over five years and befor I bought it I must have spent over $100 renting it. Aside from incredible martial arts scenes and laugh-a-minute comedy this movie has so many cool things like Chinese Black Magic, amazing array of weaponry and a great cast.THis movie never grows old.""It's all in the reflexes""."
5,Lasts the test of time,Definately it has gotten better with age. The print quality will be a treat for carpenter fans.
4,Cool add ons great flic,"Well as a surprise my boyfriend got this for me on dvd and the dvd is loaded with extras. An hour of nothing but deleted scenes, story boards, trailers of every imaginable kind and what have you on the first dvd and the actual movie on the 2nd. a great time to be had by all! Oh and the movie is coolies too!"
5,"Adventure, Magic, Kung Fu and Sheer Fun","Kurt Russel is awesome in this supernatural kung-fu adventure. He plays Jack Burton, a truck driver, initially minding his own business and having his own agenda until through a chain of circumstances, he gets involved in rescuing a friend's fiancee who gets kidnapped by the evil spirit - who, on his part needs her in order to get a human body.Rescuing her presents a more challenging task that he can manage on his own - he doesn't have only ordinary humans to fight with, but a whole host of spirits and people skilled in Chinese magic. Wild adventure begins. He spares no effort to do whatever it takes.There are people flying everywhere, changing shape, kung fu and sword fight in the air and he never knows what to expect next. Life is full of surprises."
4,"Underrated movie, good package","This movie needs more love. Really fun piece of work. The DVD extras are very entertaining. The commentary tracks are good, too. Recommended."
4,Big Trouble is Big FUN,"Check your reality at the door. This movie is about a ""regular guy"" trucker named Jack Burton (Russell) who gets caught up in this fantastic Asian subculture menace in Little China. Make no mistake -- it's a comedy with martial arts -- but not in a Jackie Chan ""in your face"" way. Some of the stunts are just plain funny and the story actually fits the mood and tempo very well. It's over-the-top acting that doesn't take itself seriously -- one of Kurt Russell's better character performances. Enjoy!"
4,Not Kirt's best film.....,"...but it was a funny movie. If you want laughs, chills, and thrills you have to see this movie.Kirt is a down to earth guy in this film, but then it all changes when his friend gets him involved in some out of this world expirments. There were great special efects. It was not Kirt's best roll, but a good one!"
5,Must Have!,I love and watched this movie when I was growing up. I just hope the Blu-Ray transfer is worth it.
2,love hate,DVD seams to be a copy from VHS tape. As such the audio varies as you play the movie. This is one of my favorite movies but can't rate it higher due to the crappy job of transfering to DVD.David
3,"WAY OVERAPPRECIATED, TAME AND FLAT","This film deserves far less respect than it has gotten. The effects are mostly obvious and stiff. The acting and one liners are predictably delivered. Still, its all fine fun, but its just not great. Its not nearly as good as a Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi movie. Better yet, Big Trouble was inspired by Zu: Warriors from Magic Mountain by Tsui Hark in 1983, wich had better effects on a lower budget and is far more interesting."
2,Big Idiots in Little Movie,"Watching this movie is like watching someone else play a video game. The sets (levels) are nice-looking and each one presents monsters and villains to be defeated. Then you get to move on to the next set (level) and the next and the next... It's all pretty tedious. Still, the DVD looks good and I give the film two stars, one for the sets and one for Kim Catrell who doesn't really redeem the film but looks pretty cute anyway."
1,The 80's were really pathetic,"As a now baby boomer.I must of been about 30 when this came out.I never knew how poor an actor Kurt Russell actually was.This movie is like a really badly written Disney movie.Awful lines,silly effects,bad acting,predictable plot.A real waste of $2.99. What is really disappointing is all the people who gave it a decent rating!Sheesh!Save your money, go out for ice cream instead."
1,Big Trouble in Little China.,"Good Actors,Beautiful Girls and My Favorite(but it rarely appears) The Semi Truck which is a cool Freightliner(I prefer KW and Peterbilt,GMC/Chevy) Conventional with Big Bunk Sleeper in this case(Credits:Special thanks to Freightliner Corporation,for a truck that appears briefly in the start and at the end),the action and fighting is great,but it makes no sense at all.Think of Karate Kid meets A Wizard or something to that effect.It is just bananas,bonkers for a guy like Carpenter to Bad Mouth Reagan and the Reagan era he sure sold out,why doesn't he give up capitalism and product placements?Stick to Horror Movies."
5,"This movie is awesome,","This movie is a classic. I love it!! Ive watched it once a day for like 4 straight before. Great movie, me and my friends all agree. 5 STAR!!!!"
4,"A fun movie, and HK-style action from before it was cool","Though I can't quite call it a classic in the same sense as Casablanca, The Ten Commandments, or 2001, this is a very fun movie with great casting and direction for its purpose.In many ways this movie takes after the Hong Kong style of action cinema, but it was produced long before Hollywood ""discovered"" Jackie Chan and Jet Lee. Carpenter added just enough from American folklore to make it play better for those unfamiliar with its roots, and the mix is very well done. All of the characters are extreme and sometimes melodramatic, but well-defined, well-cast, and well-played.This is also a very quotable movie, almost in the league of Ghostbusters and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Some of the best lines are plot or joke spoilers, unfortunately, so I won't include them here."
3,A classic campy film,"boy, when you are a kid with an imagination, this film works very very well. i had some great adventures imagined against those three magical warriors as a kid. but as an adult, i didnt enjoy it as much. oh well. it is a great campy film though."
4,great fun,"Big Trouble in Little China is a good movie for only three simple reasons: It's witty, funny, and action packed. Although the plot is a bit corny, (good guy fights bad guy and gets the girl) the movie kept me coming back for more. The special effects are good for a 1986 film, and the acting is great. (Especially by Kurt Russell) The only bad thing is that it's a bit weird and some people may not like the stupid plot. John Carpernter always goes for the weird style when he makes movies (if you've seen the remake of The Thing, also starring Kurt Russell, you'll know what I mean) and may be too weird for some. But if you like action, martial arts, (with some swords and guns thrown in for some good measure) fantasy, and witty dialog, you'll be sure to like Big trouble in Little China."
3,B Movie,"A B movie. A good B movie. A definite horror departure for a John Carpenter movie.I recall the summer it came out. The reviews were so-so at that time. It didn'tplay all that long. Not a bad romp. I don't really see any asian racism as origianaly charged when it first came out. If so, with the large asian cast, youwould think the cast would of left the set. In all. Fun."
5,Jack Burton: Greatest Hero since The Duke,"Big Troble In Little China is quite possibly one of the greatest Action Comedies of all time! The Action is thrilling and nearly every line is a memorable quote. You can tell that everyone in the cast& crew had a good time, and the viewer has a better one. If you don't own this movie you should buy it for yourself and one for your mother."
3,Flawed but Fun,"Bear in mind, the stars do not reflect the seller...too much. The copy I received had a slightly used look to the cover, but was overall quite good quality despite that. The film itself, well...it was all right. It's a fun watch for one or two viewings, and it's a good introduction to Chinese martial arts films, but the film itself has a certain hollowness to it that seems to stem from its trying to accomplish far more than it was really meant to do."
1,Product was defective,"Product audio was terrible. Music was too loud, and there were no sounds were there should have been. In addition, refund took much longer than it should have been. I will avoid these guys in the future."
3,Nice transfer to BD,"WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I SAW THIS 80`S MOVIE AND REMEMBER THAT WAS GREAT, NOW JUST TO COLLECTION EFFECT I GOT IT IN BD, AND LOOK MUCH BETTER, BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, AS A MATTER OF FACT IS A LITTLE ""CAMPY"".-GREAT FOR KIDS OLDER 8."
4,A Favorite gets the right treatment on DVD,"Why some DVD's have more material (""Fight Club"") than others (""Traffic"", for instance) is a mystery I'm sure plagues a lot of us who own DVDs. So upon reading what's in this DVD, I was a little shocked. A movie that bombed when it was released gets this kind of treatment? Well, considering it's one of my favorite films to watch, the answer is ""yes"". The picture and audio were good (bearing in mind the 80's weren't good at preserving film like today), and the commentary with Carpenter and Russell was fun (a good third of it isn't even about the movie!). For those of you who love this movie, this IS the Pork-Chop Express!"
5,big trouble in little china,was a really good movie . it had everything there was funny parts ther was wow how did they do that
4,A solid piece of work.,"This is an action adventure film. In some ways Big Trouble in Little China is better than Escape from New York. Kurt Russell does a much better job in the lead as Jack Burton. They might have called the film, Falstaff in Chinatown. There's a fine sense of humor which perfectly suits the story line. It also produces a good deal of sympathy for Jack Burton. Well, what would you do in this exciting encounter with this mysterious, magical Orient? It depends upon the support actors and actresses for the development of an incredible story along with good direction. It might be a few minutes too long but the pace of the film saves it. There ws also some fine film editing. It's wise enough to move from one scene to the other before it drags. It's a genuinely good film that I have watched on numerous occasions but I wouldn't call it an excellent or great action film. I save five stars for something outstanding in any category of film."
4,very interesting movie,i had watched this movie called big trouble in little china. i had first seen this movie on ifc on channel 209 on cable tvit was a very interesting movie because of the characters in it. with the special effects and action i had enjoyed itvery much. i would give it three and a half stars. thank you.
4,A Fun and Wacky Ride! Its All in the reflexes!,"John Carpenter and Kurt Russell have combined to make several of my favorite movies. This is one of my families favorite movies of all time. We must watch it a couple times a year, and only fast forward through the Brothel house part.It is just a lot of fun!. Only problem is what Jack Burton always says: ""You know what Jack burton also says: 'What the ..."". I think he says the F word 3 times, so bear this in mind.Famous last words: LoPan to Jack and his reply: ""Good Knife!.. Its all in the reflexes!""I used to have this rated as 5 stars WOW! but because of the language, I changed it to 4 stars."
4,"""Everybody relax I'm here.""","I'm glad, from reading these reviews, that my affinity for Jack Burton is not confined to myself. How could you not love this movie!?! It is probebly the funniest unintentional comedy of all time. My only complaint is that a sequel was (or never has been) made."
4,Big Trouble in Little China - Lotsa fun!,"Big Trouble in Little China is just a lot of fun. It's the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't seem to be able to make anymore- a good-natured, non-serious, semi-advanced special effects film that allows you to have fun for 90 minutes. It's not going to make you forget 'Star Wars' or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', but so what? You'll have fun, be entertained, laugh a little. You could do so much worse than this little gem! The bonus features on this disc make it an automatic buy for me-this is one flick you can't go wrong on!"
1,"From pop to rap,she isnt talented!","Sure,you may like J.Los music,but I dont care for it.This cd is worth listeining to a few times,but it gets boring very quick.There is alot of rap on this cd and she thinks she is a rapper right now or something.There is one song,though,""Aint it Funny""(remix)with ja rule which has a phat beat,but it ruined with terrible lyrics.I really dont like this cd at all,and do not buy anything from J.lo because non of her stuff is worth it!"
2,I'M GOING TO BE ALRIGHT,"The J LO music all sound alike, she never changes her stlye which to me, makes her music very boring."
1,Wrong Product Shipped,"I specifically ordered the ""CLEAN"" version of this CD and the ""EXPLICIT LYRICS"" version shipped. Still haven't received the correct CD."
3,Not bad,"First of all, I don't think J. Lo. makes good albums. It's only when she collaborates with ""J To The L-O! The Remixes"" producers does she shine. The R&B/Hip Hop genre suits her well, much better than Mariah. Of course Ain't that Funny & I'm Real are awesome. The remixes on this album are superior than any ""original"" song she has.The clean version eliminates the unnecessary curse words. If you like the above mentioned songs you will probably like this one."
4,J.Lo's remixes top her originals.... unlike most remix CDs.,"Jennifer Lopez has done it again with wonderful remixes. Her latin-inspired dance tunes show off her great vocals (as well as her producer's ability to work with a sound board.) Her styles range from hip hip to R&B, and of course her latin roots. This remix album is great for those who love to dance... every song makes you want to get on the dance floor. These remixes bring new (and often better) life to her hit songs, as well as some other songs you wouldn't recognise unless you owned one of her previous CDs. The only real complaint is about her remix of ""Play""... I liked the original much better. Although her use of hip-hop in her music shows her ""hard lovin' strait thuggin'"" style, I can't help but wonder if J.Lo has teamed up with EVERY male hip-hop star on this CD... it seems like every other song has a male rapper ""guest star"". Maybe I'll count next time I listen... Well, all in all, this CD is a must have on my list."
2,too artificial tasting,"I love most Jack Links jerky products,however, I was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat - the flavor was lacking true pepper taste. It tasted like a bunch of powdered old HOT spices not a true fresh pepper cure. I think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using, as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste. I have not given up on Jack Links - just ordered their turkey jerky!"
5,Hot Stuff,The Jalapeno Jerky is hot and delicious. No self respecting Texas would have it any other way. The only problem is they are always out of it so order fast.
4,Spicy Treat,"This jerky is quite spicy. Compared to pepper jerky, this is definitely a notch spicier. So make sure you like spicy food before you get it. In my opinion, it was a little too spicy for how I like my jerky, but it still had a good taste."
2,old are better,"i am very disapointed with all the new lightsabers , not because episode 2 lightsabers don't retract all the way and episode 1 do but because the luke skywalker lightsaber from 1993 is much better qulity than the new ones it is so strong that when i hit my friends anakin lightsaber my friends lightsaber un screws itself"
3,My first lightsaber,"This lightsaber is a good one! The blade is long enough (68cm), the handle is very much like Anakin's, and the humming sound is great! What I don't like about it is that the blade doesn't go all the way into the handle, the turn-on and turn-off sounds are very poor, and the light is not so strong. Nevertheless, it is a must-have for all the hardcore fans! :)..."
5,THIS IS AWESOME!,this lightsaber is the best i have ever seen. there is only two flaws1. the blade doesn't go all the way in but who cares2. the button to turn the saber on is on the handle so you always hit it and turn it on or off when you don't want to.BUT. BUT i know how to solve this problem. when you put your hand over the handle take the middle of your hand and put it over the button. now when you swing the saber the chances of hitting the button are small becuase that part of your hand doesn't stick out like your knuckles or the bottom of your hand.The sounds are great. when you hit things you hear the clash. and the hum is constant so it sounds like a real saber. the light is great in the dark of dim lit areas. that is good beucase you don't need to see the light in the bright. you need to see the light in the dark. so overall this is the greatest lightsaber i have seen!
4,Disappointing,These latest lightsabers are just rehashes of the EP1 types. They don't retract all the way into the handle (very disappointing) but apart from that it's an ok toy. At least it's better than the other type of lightsaber on the market.
5,Anakin's little friend is always useful!!,"I LOVE STAR WARS. My favourite character is Anakin, so I was really pleased when this lightsaber came out. My friends have the basic Qui Gon one, The Count Dooku one, The Obi Wan electronic one, The Anakin One, The Luke Skywalker electronic one, and the Darth Maul one. You can imagine how fun it is to have a fight with six other people. Sometimes we fight in teams, Jedi vs Sith (kinda) and sometimes we just fight all vs all. I would say that if you are gonna buy one, buy this one. Although there is a box in the middle of the handle, you can hold it so that your thumb is over the box. I really like the sounds and humming, and there is also an automatic shutoff on it if you leave it on and don't touch it for about three minutes. All in all, this is an excellent toy and should definitely be bought. G2G now, but don't forget to buy this fantastic toy. :)"
4,Good. I don't get why some people don't like it.,"Okay, my lightsaber isn't necessarily Anakin's but it is made the same way and all the details are the same. Before I get into description I have to say that all these people that think that lightsabers have to glow in the dark, what do you want from people? If you could make one like that then you have the right to criticize. And besides it saves you money! (No batteries) Look, I was disappointed when my light saber didn't glow but...Who gives??????Anyway, this light saber has alot of detail and is quite strong (don't underestimate how much it hurts when you whack it into somebody's head!) It has alot of ripples in it making it a little easier to grip.So even though it doesn't glow. Think about it. The people that made them put alot of work in it! Pick one up and make your own fun."
2,A Poor Type,"This lightsaber looks nice but isn't. Know why? The grip on the bottom (the bottom lines) are too bumby and the top has too lame buttons. To make things worse, there's a huge block in the middle!"
2,broken chain,"This necklace was OK at first, but the crystal broke off of the chain easily. I would choose a better product next time."
3,not quite what ya expect,"its a sort of how to book with not much in it being of use. i have hopped freights before and was looking for more information about locations, times, crew changes, and more, but nothing really. i mean most of the stuff in the book you can find out online like north bank fred's."
3,good but...,"sounds amazing but a bit out-of-date now unfortunately, at least i imagine it iskudos for doing the trips but could do with more travelers stories and less of the boring bits"
4,I have a First Edition,"My grandfather had a copy from back in the Civil War days. I wrote a play about it in 1949. It is fascinating, you will admire Fanny so much as she realized what a slave owner was like. She lost her children to him when she divorced Pierce Butler and had to make a living playing Shakespeare in people's living rooms."
5,great gift books,We have several books by this author and love them. This one was a gift for a friend.
3,Not for Kindergarten,"The book has beautiful pictures and contains a lot of useful information. Unfortunately, the pages are long and the information reads more like a text book at times than a story book. My third grader enjoyed parts of the book and learned from it, but my kindergartener hated it."
4,A Picture Book of Lewis and Clark Video Review,Length:: 1:25 MinsHere is a little video book review I put together for this great book!
1,Not worth it!!!,I would give this no stars if the option was available. I purchased 2 packages of these tapes for my husband to record his bible study lessons. So far each tape he has used has broken after recording. I can't see anything he is doing wrong. The quality of the tapes are just poor. I would not recommend these to anyone.
4,Pull'n Shelves,"Back in the golden days of EazyE and the 100's of NWA clones,we had an original: one-Gangsta Pat and his #1 Suspect was to be the ticket to the big time. Anyhow the cassettes,cds were all pulled off the shelves. Rumor had it that Atlantic records came under mass scrutiny for the explicit lyrics and album cover. Lack of marketing,and maybe the fact that he represented Memphis,Tenn also kept him from deserved fame.#1 Suspect is an excellent release. The most memorable track""Gangstas Need Love Too""should have been huge. Lastly,It is unfortunate that his other releases never matched the excellent quality of this one"
3,Bodily Harm a Disappointment,"I bought Bodily Harm looking forward to another great book from Margaret Atwood. Although written with Atwood's characteristically witty, deliciously descriptive language, the book fails on the content.The protagonist is a woman who has just gone through mastectomy, a loss with which she is trying to come to terms. Depressed further over the breakup with her boyfriend, she travels to a small island on the Caribbean to write a ""fun in the sun"" -article for a magazine. The vacation turns into a nightmare--the nation is undergoing a civil war.The book is replete with imagery of violence, pain, death, and suffering. This is not recommended bedtime reading, and not for the faint-of-heart."
3,A bit of a slow read in the beginning,"I found the story to be largely boring during the first 1/3 of the book or so, but things quickly got interesting. I saw Rennie as a naive woman in a country with a system she didn't understand. I thought the decisions she made were extremely naive considering she was in a foreign country. However, I guess these days we're taught to be more diligent when traveling, so the old rules no longer apply.3 stars but I wouldn't recommend this."
3,"Not Margaret's best, but engaging still","Margaret Atwood is one of my favorite authors, but I had to read this book over two sittings nearly 10 years apart. Rennie is the protagonist, and she's a bit of an enigma. Bodily Harm follows her as she struggles to feel whole again after a mastectomy. She goes to Barbados and gets caught up in some strange events; throughout this adventure, she recalls her failed relationships with two other men. I love that we do not get a clear picture of what's going on, but I think that's why I had a hard time with it when I first attempted to read this book: back then, I needed clear direction and answers when I read. While there is resolution at the end, the book is not as tight as I think it could be, and the women's voices falter a bit. Whether Atwood intended that, is beyond me...perhaps I can ask her next week when I hear her speak!"
2,Not impressed,"I love Atwood, and have been very impressed with her work in the past. Like some of the other reviewers, I anticipated a much better read, but was disappointed. If you can only read one, pass on this one."
3,What a dark and dismal horror story!,I had to read this book for an English project and I was really looking forward to reading a book by Atwood because she has been aclaimed so many times. I was very disappointed in her choice of plot and I felt that she advanced her plot in leaps and bounds. The quality of writing was what I expected but there was so many different parts to the plot that it seemed as though it had been manufactured for popularity. This was a very unfortunate piece of writing as far as Atwood is concerned and I would advise readers to forget that she even wrote it.
4,Perfect for Audi TT's convertible top windows!,"I purchased this product after reading that it works great for those of you who own Audi TT's. It is a common problem with Audi TT's that the convertible top windows start melting away from the cloth. This product works great to seal the window back to the fabric. It is not expensive, and much better then having to replace the entire top. Just be careful that you don't let the GOOP dry to the window itself. You can still scrape it off, but just a pain to clean it off."
1,Need better warning,I have a friend who used this product inside her car and received possible harmful effects from it.
4,Small,The wallet is smaller than it appears. The binding is about an inch thick and takes away from the wallet.
5,I love this album!!!,"This album is one of my favorites!! Jneiro Jarel is a musical genius and I hope to see more projects from him. Listening to this album is like walking through the city at night...bright lights and neon signs, people, cars and good vibes...this probably doesn't make any sense but listen and you will see...the 2nd track speaks for itself. This is the perfect feel good hip hop album out there...give it a listen!!"
4,Jneiro's Futuristic Free-Form Hip-Hop,"If you like hip-hop jazzy, soulful and sometimes experimental - be sure to cop this. Some tracks sound a bit like slum village, some are Tribe Called Quest-ish, but mostly he sounds DIFFERENT. Lots of versatility. Completely based in hip-hop but branching out to freaky jazz, some rock, electronic stuff, soul and more. I happened to meet this cat who's originally from Houston and now lives in Brooklyn over the internet at mp3.com a couple of years ago and now he's signed to a label right out of my homebase: Amsterdam, The Netherlands. What a small world.. The label is called Kindred Spirits Records. Check for it."
2,Just a word of warning !!!,"If you want to win at all costs, this book might serve you well. I, for one, would rather win by reasons and with unity, instead of Dick Morris' "" divide and conquer""and ""triangulation"" . Don't be too impressed by his use of political anecdotes because there are many sides to each one of them."
2,A limited analysis of political leaders,"Morris is an intelligent and astute political advisor, but this book is dull, repeats itself and really has nothing to say. The new prince was an exciting piece of political writing, this is dull and dreary. Morris has nothing really to say and is only at his best when dealing with contemporary politicians such as Al Gore. He loses himself in chapters on DeGaulle and other leaders."
5,Best book of the year,"Morris examines why various political leaders, particularly reformers, won or lost. He looks and the strength and weaknesses of these leaders, what they did, the opportunities taken and those missed. This book is essential not only for those in politics, but anyone who is looking for a fresh look at leadership in general. Most of the books I read go on a bookshelf once I am done - this one is right behind my desk, as I find myself referring to it often. Truly an excellent book."
5,Nothing short of life-changing,"This book saved us. Understanding our son as a ""hunter child"" helped us to understand the frustration he must have felt at not fitting into a world tailored to ""farmers."" The book changed how we respond to him and gave us a new respect for his valuable talents. Hartmann's proposals coupled with anecdotes about his wife's successes with their own children helped us to design an approach that has turned our relationship around and skyrocketed his confidence in himself and drawn out an outstanding ability to regulate HIMSELF."
5,Get it,"Very well written and researched - moreover, it plain makes sense given how short a time ago we became agrarian. I would not hesitate buying it."
5,interesting look at ADHD,"I picked this book up at the library. My husband was diagnosed with ADHD at an early age, and the title caught my eye. The explanation of ADHD in the book really makes sense to me. This is not a self-help book, more of a historical perspective of the traits we assign to those with ADHD. I think it is an excellent look at the pluses society ignores in ADHD children and adults. We were not made to all be the same. As I live with someone who continues to display ADHD symptoms as an adult, this book explained practically every little nuance and difference between the way we approach tasks (I am more of the farmer-type persona). I think this book gives great perspective to those that are parenting, living with, or know someone with ADHD."
3,Good but not Great,"The book provides an interesting perspective on ADD as well as ADHD, suggesting that the ""disorder"" was once an adventagous evolutionary adaptation. He cites a lot of research which does support this idea, but in some parts the book drags a bit. Particlarluy if you already know a good deal about evolution. In some parts Heartman takes his ideas a bit too far and has an almost religious zeal for this topic. Overall the book could have been organised better.Still, this is a very interesting read, and a refreshing new perspective on ADD and ADHD. Heartmans approch to ADD and ADHD is to work towards the strengths, as opposed to trying to repress the symptoms of ADD and ADHD. This is a very good book for those who are interested in the topic but have not done extensive reasearch about it yet."
2,"For self-help, buy something else","If you do have ADD, this book won't keep your attention for five minutes. I do agree with the author's premise that ADD is just a way of being that is ""different"", and even advantageous in certain situations, instead of ""wrong"", ""defective"", or ""sick"". However this book is not the self-help manual I was expecting. Instead it is full of tedious and repetitive analysis of the supposed evolutionary roots of ADD and technical discussions of the specific genes that supposedly contribute to a tendency towards ADD. This may be of interest to some but is not the best choice for an ADDer looking for practical strategies to improve their life. I resolutely plowed through the first couple of chapters, but after seeing that it was going nowhere just skimmed the rest of the book. A couple of books that I have found more helpful areADD-Friendly Ways to Organize Your LifeandDelivered from Distraction: Getting the Most out of Life with Attention Deficit Disorder."
2,warps in the oven,"I am disappointed in the quality of this name brand and higher priced pan....once in the oven it makes a bang and distorts out of shape only to return to flatness when cooled. The silicone handles are great to hold, but if you have any liquids in the pan they will gravitate to the lower side of the pan when it warps, so be careful. Non-stick surface is great. I am considering requesting an exchange as this may just be a defective one."
5,Works Great -- Love This Pan,"Thankfully, I read the dimensions were on the description of the pan so I did measure before I bought. All fit well in my double oven. I also purchased the round pans and the loaf pans. The handles are great and while you do need a pot holder, they are VERY easy to grip when removing the pan...especially in my lower oven."
4,Good appetizer,"This release is a good appetizer for the uninitiated and is always good for a quick Joplin fix. I think it's been established that there are better Joplin Greatest Hits releases, but this one isn't bad!"
5,The Best Of The First Great Female Rocker,"GREATEST HITS (EXTRA TRACKS) contains the best songs by Janis Joplin, the first great female rocker to leave an impact on the rock world. All of the songs are excellent, and it's much better than the boxed set or the soundtrack JANIS! You should get this one and ESSENTIAL JANIS JOPLIN first."
3,A great vocalist,"Janis Joplin had a distinctive, gravelly voice. She was the kind of woman who sang the blues and you knew that she meant it from the bottom of her heart and spirit. Unfortunately, she was taken from us far too soon.What she left behind is summarized in this collection. She wails beautifully on ""Summertime"" and makes you feel her raw emotion on ""Piece of my Heart,"" but can manage to sing softly, gently and reminscently of a past love on ""Me and Bobby McGee."" One of the best things about her is definitely her range of emotion she could express in her music, going from volatile and crazy to sweet, soft and serene.This CD is a great overview for anyone interested in hearing some of Joplin's greatest work."
3,Janis Joplin's greatest hits,"The music was wonderful, of course, but I was disappointed in the quality of the CD. It has minor scratches on it and the first two or three cuts skipped."
3,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be!!!,"I thought this was pretty good. I like her husky voice, but I didn't really care for the songs that much. I did like the Cry Baby song. If you love Janis Joplin, you'll love JANIS JOPLIN GREATEST HITS!!!"
4,janis in her finest hour!!,what can i say? this is definatly janis at her best.the slection of tracks are great. and the remastering truly breaths new life into these classic tracks.the songs are culled from janis all to brief but brillant carrer.when you listen to me &bobby mcgee youll understand why kris kristofferson would say.yeah i wrote that song. but it will always be janis.
4,Missing a few tracks...,"This is a good ""Greatest Hits"" album, but it is definitely lacking a few of Janis Joplin's best songs. The more recent ""18 Essential Songs"" has almost all the songs on ""Greatest Hits"", as well as Summertime, Raise Your Hand, Half Moon, Kozmic Blues, I Need A Man To Love, Trouble in Mind, Tell Mama and Trust Me, most of which are lesser known but still essential. I'd recomend the ""18 Essential Songs"" as a more complete album (despite the ""Greatest Hits"" re-release with the bonus tracks) if you're looking to get into Janis, or if you like Janis already but don't want to go for the box set."
4,The one Janis Joplin CD to have,"If you only own one Janis Joplin CD then this is the one to own. This album was first released in 1973, three years after Joplin's death. It may include her ""Greatest Hits"" but certainly not all of her best songs. If you are just discovering Janis Joplin, for the first time, this is the place to start."
3,my favorite singer,"i truly do love janis, but ""18 essential songs"" is a far better collection. If i were you, i'd wait till about june, cause that's when they're supposed to release remastered works of her albums, so if your a new fan, be patient!!!"
3,"music good, sound bad","The music deserves four stars, but one should be taken off because the sound is horrible. WARNING: don't buy anything from Columbia reissued in 1987. The sound is not remastered and it sounds horrible. The other bad thing is that her albums aren't remastered either so you really don't have anywhere to turn. I thought it was hopeless for Columbia until they reissued Santana's work, not only that but it was one of the best, clearest remasters I've ever heard, the same with the Byrds. So I'm just waiting patiently until Columbia, hopefully, will remaster her work, and hopfully they will remaster Bob Dylan's albums too."
2,not recommended unless you're already a fan,Don't buy this album unless you're already a Janis Joplin fan. I bought it to check her music out and was disappointed. The greatest hits could simply be a single of the first song.
2,Not my cup o tea,I tried really hard to like this album to no avail. Three good classic songs not much else. Just buy the singles
3,Hard to download,MP3 was easy to place in the cloud but hard to download on to my computer. I use Ubuntu 11.10 and couldn't download the album each song had to be downloaded one at a time.
4,"Oh Janice,",I needed to remember how progressive Janice was yet forgot about that scratchy voice. Nice memory
2,Janis Joplin - Greatest Hits,She must have recorded these w/o the Southern Comfort. These are the Greatest Hits? I have better recordings. She sounds better live. Alive?
2,review,"Content of cd was ok...was only interested in a couple of the hits. However, Amazon's service was very, very fast."
4,Love it,"I must say that I bought her cd not really knowing who she was as a person and after listening to her cd, I felt like I really did get to know a little about her. I love this cd!! My purpose in buying it has succeeded!"
5,My first introduction to Janis.,"First I must say that this CD will always be special to me, as it introduced me to Janis Joplin. I would like to point out that most of Janis' best songs are not featured here. I would really recommend buying ""The Essential Janis Joplin"". However, this album is an excellent place to start.What I love most about Janis on this album is her signature raspy vocals, unleashed raw energy and the real true gem of this record, is the live version of ""Ball And Chain"".(Which is one of my VERY favorite songs of hers).One cannot deny the power and substance of such stellar tracks here such as ""Piece Of My Heart"", ""Me And Bobby McGee"" and ""Move Over"". Another exciting highlight on this greatest hits compilation would be Janis' cover of the Gershwin classic ""Summertime"".Overall an excellent snapshot of Janis and the music of the late 60's."
5,"""The Best Joplin C.D of all time""-Bobby McGee","This C.D would have to be one of the best ever, not just by Janis Joplin either. It has such of a variety of songs, rythems and lyrics for any soul. (you may even find yourself singing and dancing around the house to all of your old favourites and to your new ones too!) Hope you love it as much as I did, and still do! enjoy."
2,very average,"i don't get all the attention that she gets.she was a bad singer period.i like me&Bobby McGee,&Mercedes Benz.but her work is lacking for me.she wanted to be Bessie Smith but sadly she never even comes close."
1,Waste of a gift,Title displays how i feel about this purchase it was a gift i hated giving but that is what they asked for.
1,The Worst Compilation Ever,Well I guess thath they didn't have a lot of songs to choose from since all of her music is just plane crap.
3,What about the sound.....,"These are all wonderful songs. A rare treat not to have fillers on an album. This was a hit when it was released and still is. Being a 1970 graduate I still know each and every song and I still have my vinyl. I didn't give it a five star rating because I believed the sticker on the CD case that said ""remastered"". The sound is so bad. I have a good sound system and some of the instruments sound terrible. Almost painful in places. Unfair to such an otherwise great album. I don't think it would be that costly to make this truly ""remastered""."
2,"Get the albums, don't depend on Greatest Hits for best Janis","This was the first Janis CD I got and wasn't too impressed, so didn't pursue her career any further. After hearing several vinyl records at my friends' house of her, I bought her albums on CD and boy, is this GREATEST HITS a sorry excuse for a representation! I GOT 'DEM OL' KOZMIC BLUES AGAIN MAMA! has only one song, ""Try"", while the whole album is great. PEARL has the majority of cuts, plus a few from CHEAP THRILLS, IN CONCERT and one from BIG BROTHER AND THE HOLDING COMPANY (yet to be released on CD!). The live cuts are horrible and there's nowhere to turn to get better, so accept this! For those who want to try her for the first time, get 18 ESSENTIAL SONGS."
5,Some of Janis Joplins great songs,Janis Joplin works her way to the top of the singing industry. The sudden influx of a lot of money is difficult for her to handle. We lose a lot of our singers and sports stars and lottery winners because they cannot handle a lot of money.
3,Not Complete By Any Means,"HOW COULD ANYONE PUBLISH A CD OF JANIS WITHOUT ""TURTLE BLUES"", ONE OF HER OWN COMPOSITIONS AND ONE OF HER BEST??????????????????????"
1,returned it!,"The ""medium density"" rubber mallets were hard hard hard and the handles were plastic as well. Not at all what I thought I was getting."
2,Not rubber,"These are plastic, not rubber. You get what you pay for, I guess. Very cheap/poor quality. Should have just forked out the $15 to begin with to get a decent pair."
5,love ellen,"i love ellen barretts videos. i have been doing 2 of her other videos and really have been wanting to learn yoga. definitely not as easy as i thought it would be. im new to yoga and i could do about half the video, probably less. But my insides(abs) hurt for 2 full days. so it deff works. Im excited to get more flexible to be able to do the video, it will take some time but ellen makes it enjoyable. and this is coming from someone who hates working out."
5,This is great!,"This is not a Yoga workout. It combines yoga moves with pilates, stretching, cardio, etc. Don't be scared by the title of this DVD. It is much more than typical yoga. Love it! Ellen always does such a great job with her workouts. I'm a fan."
3,Fine... but Ellen has better ones!,"I own all of Ellen Barretts DVDs and have been working out with them for a few years now - so I was excited to hear she had a few new releases. Her ""Yogini"" workout did make me work up a sweat, and I like that there's no high impact jumping to annoy my downstairs neighbors, but I found this workout quite difficult towards the end, when there are a lot of moves from the ""Plank"" position, which is really hard for me to do - especially stretching out from the plank to a one-handed side stretch!I don't do yoga and am only familiar with some basic moves, but somehow, this workout didn't really do it for me. Having said that: It's a good stretching out of the back, so if you have tension there: go for it!"
4,"Loathsome heroes, charming villains","I loved this book, great thriller, good action, killer dialogue. But, the couple of heroes at the heart of King Suckerman are loathsome, to say the least. All macho, all the time? Gimme a break from that knight-in-shinning armor shit! The villains on the other hand are quite charming, except when you consider their villanous deeds, of course."
5,King Suckerman just sucked me right in!,"Pelecanos hooks you from the very first page and makes you want to keep turning 'till the end.His knowledge of pop-culture in the 70's is outstanding and his descriptions of the locales and how it all unfolds is right on the money!This book leaves you jealous when the characters are having a good time and downright bummed when one or more of the characters leaves and/or dies.It takes alot to keep me interested, but this book kept me up all night looking forward to the end."
3,A Definite Homage To The 70's!,"King Suckerman is a great, fun book to read, the characters are alive and interesting! It's a story set in 1976 in Washington D.C. with loads of violence(those that don't like to read this sort of thing may want to stay away)grittiness and humor. The book would have made a fantastic blaxploitation movie or a 70's B movie. The only thing that bothered me was that there were too many references regarding music,characters talked about the music from back then constantly, it got to be a little annoying, other than that I loved the book!"
3,The Tarantino Effect,"Why do Americans think violence is so cool? I don't get it...I love crime novels. Always have. I was weaned on Chandler and Hammett and James M. Cain and Jim Thompson. I've read all the contemprary guys: Pelecanos, Ellroy, Leonard, etc. As a writer, Pelecanos is as good as any of them, but like many today he relies way too often on the cheapest trick in the book: cartoonish, graphic violence to sustain narrative tension. King Suckerman is a classic example, only here, after many incidents of lurid, sadistic killing we get a moral at the end about personal responsibility. Give me a break. Anyway, like I said, the guy can write (though I could do without the pop culture references on every page). But it is was it is: cartoon crime fiction aimed at an adolescent male mentality, a long way from the adult crime fiction of Chandler and Cain and Thompson."
2,Weak,"This book did little for me. At times, it read like nothing more than a recount of 1970's brand names and music trivia. Since this was the first Pelecanos book I read, I missed out on any references to his other works. Accordingly, I found the characters very flat and cliched. I would not recommend this work to the casual reader."
1,NOT MY CUP OF TEA!!!,"I am sorry. Have read several books by Pelecanos ant this is the only one I have not liked. I quit reading after 108 pages. To much reference to songs and movies. Nearly every page talkes abou different songs and who likes what. Also, way to much sex for me. Sex with man and woman, sex with man and man. I like good crime books but not sex books. I am sure I am in the minority and the book will go great guns but it is not for me at all."
1,not as advertised,"the sheath is cheap nylon, not the abs plastic snap in sheath that the picture shows. not a timberwolf sword. I actually ordered this because I had ordered this from Budk and loved it, so I ordered another from Amazon. the one that Amazon sent was not the right one, it does not even look similar, it has chinese writing on the blade and is not what I ordered..."
3,Not Bad! The sheath leaves a little to be desired.,The blade was easily touched up with a carbide hand held sharpener. I have used this for trimming a few trees and battoning firewood with great success. I attached the sheath to a alice pack with ease. The sheath fails to secure the blade when holding on to the sheath and shaking it up and down. If the sheath fully secured the blade I would have rated it five stars.
5,It's worth it!,"It's just what I had expected. It had got here on the exact day they said it would, which I appreciate. This sword is light and it came very sharp. I love the feel of it. Wonderful quality sheath and sword. Definitely worth the money."
3,Timber Wolf Full Tang Ninja Sword,The sword is great the cloth grip I will have to remove and maybe try something else. I gave it 3 stars because I did not receive the sheath that is in the picture I was given a all cloth one.
4,Nice for the Price,"The blade is heavy and sharp out of the box. The locking sheath is a heavy plastic but very functional. Looks menacing. The nylon cord, as many reviewers have said is...or can be slick. I'm thinking of other options that are not going to be cheesy looking (i.e. tape). Look out ZOMBIES! Just kidding ;>)"
2,"Ehhhhh, no...","FOR SHOW ONLY. Blade is cheap. Threw it lightly downward into a log and the whole tip bent. Not a heavy duty sword at allll. Chips out of blade also just from casual brush clearing. Wrap around handle is wack and wrap comes lose and travels up and down blade, underneath the wrap is some black plastic. Maybe causing the wrap to travel idk?... lol... The sword is good for display that's about it. The sheath is just pure nylon crap (so just throw it in the toilet, then take it out and give it to someone you don't like for christmas)."
5,Nice,Very durable and nice look Just wish the handle wrapping stayed in place. The rope is good quality but it slides up and down the handle. Had to use tape on the ends to hold it still.
4,Good looks,"I bought this for a friends costume as a Warrior/Angel holloween/cosplay getup, it looks cool and has a ok weight to it, sheath can be mounted in various ways, havent used it to hit anything scared it will break or bend."
3,Good for the price.,"For the price, it's hard to beat, if you're looking for a full-tang blade of this make. The handle leaves some to be desired; although it can be improved with a bit of gorilla glue beneath the string and where the threads meet, then coat handle in rubberized paint a few times. The blade arrived rather dull, but again that can be done by hand or with electric blade sharpener. This sword would be good as is for dress, but if you want it functional, it will need some work. Also, the sheath included is NOT the plastic sheath some include. I was disappointed to realize this upon arrival, but didn't want to bother sending it back. I probably would recommend getting this sword if you can get ahold of one with the plastic sheath."
2,Best Pizza Cutter I ever had!,Crap steel. crap edge. crap handel wrap. the tang has a cut out in it in the shap of a throwing knife and so is weak. crap wood plat's wraped in plastic bag like strips covered with crap nylon web cord. I striped the handl taped the wood plates in place and wraped it with some spare 550 cord I had. and It Is truly an awsome pizza cutter for cutting yer oven baked pizza. that's about as good as it get's. sheath? Crap.But for 15 buck's it's the best dame pizza cutter you can get fot that price!
4,"Nice Sword, Horrible Sheath","I bought this sword because of the price and wasn't expecting much, but what I got is a very nice quality Full Tang single edged sword that DOES COME SHARP. The only problems that I had were with the sheath. I wasn't expecting much out of the sheath anyway, but I was at least hoping that it had a hard plastic liner inside it since the sword is meant to be strapped across the back. Sadly, it is only flexible nylon, which makes it literally impossible to re-sheath the blade with the sheath in its proper position. This problem led me to make my own sheath for it with 1 1/4"" PVC pipe, A Heat Gun(Can use blow torch as well, just don't get too close to pvc), Electrical tape, and the now recycled nylon sheath that came with the sword in the first place. I will add pictures of both the sword, and my homemade sheath at a later time. All in all, Good sword, bad sheath."
3,Not bad,"A decent sword for the price. It's probably only useful for display or maybe protecting yourself one time. I doubt it would stand up to any serious combat, but I'm sure it intended as a novelty item. I was impressed with the case however."
1,NO!,"It's [Weak]! Sorry about the language, but i don't see the point of this over the top camp musical and also whats Walter Matthau doing in it. It's a musical man and you can't sing. But still, i believe his acting was on top form compared to Barbra Streisand. Now i don't meen to offend any of her fans in this review so from now on i suggest you look away.The woman sounds like shes got a cold and when she ""attempts"" the high notes she sounds like a male horse been run over. Her acting is not mutch better as she performs as though she should be doing an ameteur production in the Skegness resort for tourists.Micheal Crawford is [weak] ... But as i have stressed, these are my opinions and i know alot of people will disagree so if you like your musicals weak, lacking in believable characters and campness, then pay no attention to me!"
5,Love this movie,"For anyone who enjoys a light hearted, musical romp, this is for you. The music, dancing and story are wonderful and fun to watch again and again."
2,Hello. Your lips don't sync,Video did not sync with the audio. I'm sure it something to do with our speed of the Internet or something. It could not be the computer. It's brand new mini Mac. So that's it
5,"Great music, funny sweet and wonderful story",What can be said about this lovely sweet tale?? Great music and one of the great musicals. I was so happy to add it to my collection. I feel it was a great value and will repay me over and over as I watch it over and over.
3,Packaging Issue,Item was new and wrapped. However the plastic is ripped and there is a hole in the case. It looks like something broke through and cracked it.
5,Still a great movie!,"Yes, it's a musical. Yes, it's got a few years on it, but it's still a classic musical. Fit for viewers of any age."
5,A Must Have Classic Movie,"A wonderful musical that the songs keep playing in your head. Gene Kelly did an awesome job directing and casting. If you've seen Wall E, you'll want the entire musical. Barbra Streisand, Michael Crawford and Walter Mathow are incredable."
4,Barbara Streisand is wonderful to watch,"The disk was loose inside the DVD case, but it didn't cause any scratches. The movie itself is fun, with catchy songs and much fanfare. I esp. enjoyed Barbara Streisand's scenes. Wonderful and colorful character. Other parts of the movie drag a bit, but overall, an entertaining way to pass an evening."
5,Hello Dolly DVD,It is great to be able to buy loved movies at a great price. Hello Dolly is wonderful and fun to view!
4,Hello Dolly,"Movie for all family, good old fashion style, it is my firs timeviewing this movie, I recomend it very well."
4,Hello Dolly,"Barbara Streisand and Louie Armstrong in a smash hit. The performing dancers and the singer were excellent. I loved the whole show, although part of the taping seemed to freeze near the end."
1,The series of disconnected overblown musical numbers,"I was really disappointed by this movie. And keep in mind that I am a huge fan of Gene Kelly and musicals. This one is not any good though. I just fast-forwarded through most of the songs. They start completely irrelevant to the main plot and seems to be there for the sake of being there. Almost like the director said: ""Every 10 minutes we start new musical number, doesn't matter which one"". There is no chemistry between two main characters. Acting seems forced."
2,Striesand & Cast of Thousands Sink to the Bottom,"Over-long, over-blown, and remarkably slow, the film version is perhaps most remarkable for its incredibly bad casting. The music is a delight, and the incredibly miscast Striesand gives full vocal reign to her songs, but this alone is not enough to make the film-- which has some of the stagiest cinematography since the 1930s-- a success. One star for Striesand's attempts to pull it off and a one star for dazzling costumes."
2,"Great musical, Streisand again overcontrols","Though the songs are wonderful, and the rest of the cast is exactly what I like in a Broadway musical, once again Streisand ruins it for me. Her constant need to upstage and control counteracts the Ensemble mood this piece needs to achieve. While Dolly is truly a memorable character and needs someone strong, the rest of the cast deserves their moment because they are all truly wonderful. I adore Horace: Walter Mathau is superb. Louis Armstrong is a perfect adition, and Barnabas and his buddy are comically appealing. I just would've loved to have seen this with someone willing to share the spotlight. Technically, BS is fine, but I never got the impression she felt any of the music. She never ""became"" Dolly, to me."
2,"Good movie, bad seller",The stupid guy who sold me this video only sold me half of the movie. I paid 35 dollars for this video and it doesn't even have the entire beginning half of it! I am completely unsatisfied and I would appreciate my money back. Thank you.
2,I only watched it to see Michael Crawford. It is poor.,"You would have to have some other reason to watch this than entertainment. It was long and draggy with very few high points. One was, of course, Louis Armstrong. Even that wasn't his best. Michael Crawford is always a joy. How he has changed! I own just about everything he ever did but I probably won't buy this."
1,Babs as Dolly?????,"Don't waste your time or your money. I was in the original version on Broadway years back and one of the revivals. The tranfer from stage to film is HORRIBLE. In true Babs fashion she had to be in control of this production as she is in her everyday life... All the songs she sings are altered to her satisfaction and takes away from the rest of the cast. Speaking of the rest of the cast,they are all GREAT and have WONDERFUL stage presents...Somewhere in the world you will still see stage productions of ""Hello, Dolly"". Go see the stage version, after all if it wasn't good it wouldn't have lasted 40 some odd years."
5,One of the Greatest Movies I've Ever Seen!,"""Hello, Dolly!"" is such a WONDERFUL MOVIE! It's one of my all time favorite musicals and one of the best movies I've ever seen. (How do you think I decided on my email address!) I'm always in such a good mood after I watch it. The MUSIC IS FABULOUS-upbeat and lively; it makes you want to get up and dance! I think Barbra Streisand gave a great performance and the role of Dolly Levi fit her well. All the costumes are beautiful and really give the movie the turn of the century feel. This movie is perfect if you want a nice comedy with a happy ending. Deffinitely a movie you could watch over, and over, and over..."
3,What is the real aspect ratio on the DVD?,"This was far from being the greatest musical [opinion based on theatrical viewing], but it was filmed in the greatest widescreen process.Since Hello Dolly! was filmed in Todd-AO, it should not have a 2:35:1 aspect ratio (unless --horrors -- they made the DVD from a 35 mm print). Todd-AO, probably the best 70 mm format at the time of Dolly!, had an aspect ratio of 2.2:1, and when projected on a curved screen viewed from pretty much directly in front, more like 2:1, either of which would be more comfortable to look at, and more involving, than the too ribbon-like 2.35:1. So, either both the DVD box and the Amazon website are wrong, and the DVD image is really 2.2:1, or the disk was made from a 35 mm reduction print, which would be too bad. Can anyone tell us which is true?"
5,Wonderful Adaptation,"Gene Kelly brings a brilliant and beautiful adaptation to the screen. Barbra Steinstand, although a different Dolly than Carol Channing holds her own as the clever, comedic foil to Walter Mattheau. Along with a young Michael Crawford and a charming Tommy Tune this brilliantly choreographed and costumed show is well worth buying."
2,Hello dolly VHS,Hi great film but color is compleatly distorted. The color is all in greens and black. can you tell me if I can purchas one that is ok even if it is in dvd format. thanks lyle.
5,Hello Dolly,"Casting was outstanding. Selection of songs & singers could not have been better. My son (43 yrs old & disadvantaged)has worn out 2 VHS tapes of ""Hello Dolly"" he watches other movies but returns to this great musical comedy continually. I believe Barbra Striesand is one of the greatest singer of songs in our time (or any time) and if possible, she outdid herself in this wonderful movie.Walter Matthau is a truly funny guy, I've seen every movie he ever made from comedy to dramatic and the same goes for Barbra Striesand. What a wonderful, joyous, comedic musical movie, it's a forever movie for any age."
3,I love the title track.,"I had heard ""Hello, Dolly"" at a young age. I'd thought it sounded like Dolly had left home at a young age and the show was her returning home, perhaps followed by her decision to leave home again. I was in for a vigorous ""awakening"".I enjoyed the little bit of plot; I DEFINITELY enjoyed seeing a younger Walter Matthau on the screen! I had to concentrate on the show a little, make sure I was watching Dolly Levi, the character, not Barbra Streisand, the actress. Somewhat difficult, due to Streisand's actions and views over the years.All in all, not too bad, except the director and producer could've cut about 25-40% of the dance numbers. I like a good bit of dancing, but not THIS much!"
2,green and yellow feathers in Barbra Streisand's red hair,This movie is a series of missteps in terms of costume design and color combinations. There is also too much screen time given to the secondary characters and not enough to Barbra Streisand. I did enjoy seeing a young Tommy Tune.
3,So so,I purchased this because I remembered loving this movie growing up. After re-watching it now years later I have to say it's only ok.
2,What the hell was THAT?,"I found little to recommend this film except the sheer effort that obviously went into its production. After finally seeing it for the first time my first thoughts were ""That was wildly miscast, and the plot made NO sense whatsoever"". Subsequent investigation proved I am not alone in these opinions, the substance of which can be found in many other reviews of this film.In toto, if you're a fan of Barbra and immense egos then this is the film for you. Otherwise, rent or buyThe Music Man (Special Edition). You'll have a much better time."
3,disappointment,I was disappointed only because the songs are not SUBTITLED!!!May I ask...why??Thank you
2,Where's Carol? Bring back Carol!,"I adore Barbra Streisand, but I must say that she is not Dolly. Someone else reviewed it that she was not middle-aged, and therefore did not play it middle-aged, but the fact of the Matter is that Dolly is middle-aged, and Barbra was not. She is also just not right for the role.The other thing in the cutting and hacking of the score. Jerry Herman himself complained about how and where his songs were placed in this movie. He even wrote a new song (""Just Leave Everything to Me"") in for Barbra in replacement of ""I Put My Hand In,"" and says in his autobiography that it was moved from where he originally intended it, to a spot that did not work as well. Get the cd with Carol Channing (original cast or revival, both are just fine), and then get Funny Girl if you like Barbra."
3,Really slow s&h even when expedited,This seller has really slow s&h even when you pay to have expedited. It took 4-5 days to get item even when I paid to receive in 1 to 2 days --long past the birthday date when I needed the item.
5,Excellent!,This is an excellent book for those of us who grew up with Motown! Now I can sing along and even sing the correct lyrics.
2,Metaphysical navel gazing and UFOs.,"Frank Herbert produced a number of pot boilers, such as the ""Whipping Star"" series, before creating ""Dune"" which, excluding some of its sequels, must rank as the definitive alterntaive future history with a unique depth of characterisation and ""world building"". This book has a couple of gimmicks to it, some salacious imagery, but the metaphysical value of it all escapes this reviewer (apologies to our Dutch contributor). There is a good point about the comparative difference between human/organic potentials and closed, mechanistic systems, but that isn't enough to sustain the read. Read ""Dune"" or ""Dragon under the Sea"" (a.k.a ""Under Pressure"") for better Frank Herbert."
2,"Great music, weak recording.","The music on these two CDs is great, but the recording quality seems low. Sound like it was recorded in 1940, but it was about 1970."
2,Untasty Beef Jerky,"I do not think Slim Jim's brand of jerky is tasty. No distinct flavors and is not reminiscent of Slim Jim brand snacks, for those that may feel there is a connection. In the world of jerky this one rates rather low. Personal opinion, I don't have any facts to back up my distaste for the jerky though. This is bargain jerky."
3,Worth having if you like compilations,"The Grammy Nominees CD 2002 is a worthy addition to any compliation album lover's collection. The main reason I purchased this CD was for the Craig David track. In my opinion, this one track makes purchasing the CD worth the [money]... Craig has proven himself to be Grammy worthy while topping the charts the world over. I recommend Craig's first album, ""Born To Do It"" to anyone looking for a change from the bubblegum record label sales machine to actual music with a heart and soul. Overall, the Grammy Nominees CD gives a good sample of who to root for come Grammy night."
5,Reason..Craig David....,Let me tell you something...Better look out for craig david...He's exploding...You have fill me in on this album...just listening to this song itself..should get your day going...keep you in pace...and the other songs in the album are hott...the king of pop MJ...u Have smoooth RnB with Brian Mcknight...and others....But...like I said...watch for Craig David...give him his props...He don't get enough...And I also suggest getting his CD...U won't regret it...it will be an everyday cd.
5,Lets Make Craig Davis a Winner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For those of you who don't know. Craig David is nominated for a Grammy in the category ""Best Pop Vocal Performance Male"" for his first album ""Born to Do It."" This album is a real winner and it has helped his career a lot. His song ""Fill Me In""( which is on the Grammy 2002 album) was his first hit in the U.S. and will not be his last. So check out his song on the Grammy 2002 album and his CD ""Fill Me In."""
5,Here is somethin' good.,This is a good album. It is worth listening to over and over. Here is the track list for it:Track List:1. Video- India Arie2. Fallin'- Alicia Keys3. Ms. Jackson- Outkast4. Drops Of Jupiter- Train5. Walk On- U26. Honest With Me- Bob Dylan7. I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow- The Soggy Bottom Boys8. I'm Like A Bird- Nelly Furtado9. Babylon (LIVE)- David Gray10.

Shape Of My Heart- Backstreet Boys16. Superman (It's Not Easy)- Five For Fighting17. Imitation Of Life- R.E.M.So what are ya waitin' for. Go ad get it now or today. Thanks guys!
3,Craig David - not all what hes cracked up to be ...,"Obviously Craig had all his friends write glowing recommendations for the review of this CD. His sound IS ""bubble gumish"" - nothing new to the music scene at all! The other artists on this CD are superb - but Mr Davids work did NOT impress me at all. I read the reviews on here and really take them to heart - but when there is a blatant ""pushing"" of a not so great artist - it infuriates me!"
5,He DID IT! Afterall he was BORN TO DO IT!,"Craig David's CD ""Born to di it"" is a masterpiece. It takes you into different levels and moods with each song on the album. My personal favorite ""walking Away"" makes my day everytime I litsen to it. If you haven't done it yet, DO IT! get the CD"
4,On par with the past grammy CD's,"Okay, what is it with the Craig David obsession? Seriously? I mean, i'm not saying ""Fill me in"" is bad, or that Craig David is a poor singer, but I do think there are other names to be mentioned on this CD..and I don't think Craig David is all that great, either.The inclusion of Train, Five For Fighting and Nelly Furtado helped in my decision to purchase this CD, but the real deciding factor was the inclusion of a truly phenomenal live version of David Gray's Babylon. The CD has also introduced me to India Arie's ""Video"" which is songwriting at a very rare level of quality.The only obvious omission is a Linkin Park track."
2,if it were not for the particular artist i'm plugging......,"good compilation cd. i think the bunny wailer track is the best on the cd. bunny wailer is sure to get a grammy for his trememdous work here. go out and get his best album ""spliffin it haard ya"". it's the reason i got this cd. all the other songs [are bad], but overall it is a good cd because of the bunny wailer song. blah blah blah, plug bunny wailer here plug bunny wailer there. let's vote for him at the grammy's. let's shamelessly write dozens of reviews about this cd and endorse bunny wailer. craig david fans eat me. gfy"
3,"Interesting, Not Objective","While it seems a reasonable review, there isn't the objective coverage of Falun Gong's racist elements that I would expect of a truly objective book. Specifically, biracial children have no place in Heaven. That, and their targeting of the Chinese Communist Party, makes them as welcomed in China as A.N.S.W.E.R. is by the Bush Administration. Falun Gong's racism is enough for them to be thoroughly discredited. Then, there is their intolerance of gays and lesbians. They're a lunatic fringe cult, just like our own Aryan Nation."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Let me start by saying that I was surprised over the quality of the DVD. I know in the description it says ""remastered from the 90s"", but I didn't think it was going to look like someone's home video. However, the magic circle exercises that she demonstrates (which are mostly for your arms and legs - no core work) are all very good and somewhat challenging. I don't really see me using the DVD again because its more of a how-to and not a full pilates routine. Those looking for an intermediate/advanced routine, I would skip this DVD."
5,Noticed a Difference,My doctor reccommended this for getting my cortisol levels back into alignment. The memory boost was a pleasant surprise.
3,Works but has sideeffects,"I purchased this product hoping of an improvement in memory, and to lessen mental fatigue after a long day at work.I took this product of about a week and noticed that I was able to think and work a bit better. I would not say it had a dramatic effect so I would not continue to pay the money for so little improvement.My biggest issue with this product is that I can't sleep on this product. I would take this in the morning and go to bed at 9. Then stare at the clock till 3am. Not worth it at all."
1,"Headaches, no Noticeable Change in Concentration","I noticed no noticeable change in concentration after taking this product for three weeks. I began to develop significant headaches after two weeks, which went away two days after I stopped taking it."
5,Powerful interpretation of a classic,"If this is the Oedipus Rex conducted by Ozawa, starring Jessye Norman, other opera greats and the most impressive chorus I have ever heard, then you MUST see and hear this production! It's musically powerful, visually stunning and acted with incredible dignity and life. I have never been so impressed with a video production of any opera... and I've seen and enjoyed many. This is a must have for any opera lover.- To, Amazon.com, please get this back in stock!"
5,stunning performance!,"If this is the live recording from the Japanese Saito Kinen festival 1993, it is the most stunning performance of Oedipus Rex that I know! Norman's stately Jocaste, along with the enourmously powerful Japanese speaker (Kayoko Shiraishi's monologues in Japanese lends much more patos than the original French), as well as the amazing staging production turns this into an amazingly impressive performance!"
4,Brilliant experimental production,"This is a stunning and daring production of a real jewel. Stravinsky's music for this opera-oratorio is compelling and beautiful. Julie Taymor succeeded in transforming what the composer saw as a static staging into a great experience with the right amount of movement without contradicting the composer's vision.This was a staged production with some minimal additions to create a film. It was performed in 1992 (and filmed on super film) so, compared to today's films and technologies, it looks old. But, with a little imagination you can be transported into the theater. Being in that theater should have been an incredible experience!The singers are exceptional including the young Bryan Terfel. The reconstructed sound is very good.I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Stravinsky's work, and who longs for creative and daring production of operas that maintain the composer's vision."
5,Oedipus Rex music by Stravinsky,The performance is outstanding. From the music to the costumes and settings it was just stunning.
4,Well Worth the Pause and Reflect,"I picked this up after a short hike in the Ventana Wilderness in the Big Sur area...to my surprise, one of the selected poems spoke exactly to the experience of the day: ""Return"".Many of the reviews here are a bit dated. In 2009, we find ourselves mired in a number of national problems, so maybe it's time for another look at Jeffers.For myself, I find comfort in the natural things he talks about - the poems remind me that we can simplify, and maybe that's a goal we should be looking at again.On the other hand, perhaps the moment's distraction is enough. So keep this book nearby for those times."
2,Technically Beauthful But Weird,"The film is beautifully made & from a purely technical standpoint deserves 5 stars. But it's premise is never realized & in the end the film is a big disappointment because though Phibes defeats all his ""enemies"" his dead wife is not brought back to life. A very weird film."
4,What can I say,I have loved Dr Phibes since I first saw him on the silver screen about 1970. It has been my long held belief that this follow up to the orginial is better than the orginial!
2,Lacks the sparkle of its predecessor,"The Abominable Dr Phibes, for all its gruesomeness and unpleasantness, was witty and sharp, but the sequel is just pedestrian and flat. As the doctor, Vincent Price doesn't seem to enjoy himself as much, and the film is absent the irony that made the original so memorable. Brian Eatwell's sets aren't half as impressive as his earlier creations, and Basil Kirchin's musical direction is sorely missed.Only the ending manages to capture something of the same spirit, but it is hardly worth waiting an hour and twenty minutes for."
1,Real Disappointment!,Not worth the money. No plot. Just some nonsense. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Waste of Time with NO HELP,"Don't spend your money on this terrible software. It is a bit easier to use then some programs, but the use is annoying. The worst part is their tech support. They are arrogant and never help you with your Sibelius problems. Don't bother even calling."
2,Sibelius 2,"Very pretty interface design, but I purchase software to get a job done. Unfortunately Sibelius 2 is too slow to be used as a music engraving tool. And contrary to their slick advertising copy, you can't get much done out of the box without studying the manuals in detail. I think I'll leave this one to the amateurs and the wannabes.The best, and still champion, in this category is MakeMusic's Finale 2003."
2,Substandard Quality,Three of the twelve blades I recieved where darker and more discolored than the other 9 blades. With Nylon this discoloration is indicative of a too high a melt or molding temperature and or the use of regrinde in the injection molding process. It is also an indicator that the plastic is starting to degrade and go into modulas. Weakening and degrading elastisity strength and durability of the resin. Also the 3 blades in question seemed to wear out sooner the the other 9. With 34 years in the plastic injetion molding industry I believe this supplier or the injection molder my be praying on a public that is uneducated with the plastics industry. The quality of these blades was very disappointing.
3,Buy the Stihl brand instead,"I used these blades one time so far on my Stihl FS45 trimmer. The good? They come in a pack of 12, which is a logical number since there are 3 blades in use at a time. The bad? Unlike the Stihl brand which appear to be made from a softer nylon, these blades seem much more ""plasticky"" and in one use, I literally sheared off pieces of 2 blades. I don't have a particularly big yard or a lot of rocks to trim around but I will now need to replace the blades after 1 use. I used to get a few trims out of the Stihl blades. Sometimes you can be pennywise and pound foolish--here's an example of trying to save $ only to end up with an inferior product to the original."
5,Versatile and long-lasting!,"I have owned this sweater for 6+ years and it has become one of my staple pieces. Love the merino wool, of course, because it is so versatile: I wear this sweater casually with jeans, traveling in areas where weather is unpredictable (it is impermeable to damp air and rain!), or as a light layer because it regulates temperature so well- I have even worn it cave crawling! Keeps me warm and dry and the lines are flattering too. Careful to wash in cold water, and its best to let it air dry since wool shrinks up easily, especially over time. All in all- worth the money because of how durable, versatile, and flattering it is."
5,it's been in my cd player for weeks,"This is one great album! I was the owner of a punk music store so, I've heard my share of bands This ranks high on my list. Funny, witty, lyrics, great musical talent the vocals are smooth and the band is tight. I can't get enough."
4,Best Women's Vitamins out there,"As a woman in her mid twenties and of child bearing age I wanted to make sure I was getting all the vitamins I need at this point in my life and in preparation for starting a family. Rainbow Light seems to fit the best. The only drawback is you do have to take 6 per day but, since it gives me what I need I don't mind. I compared many vitamins to these and Women's Answer was the only ones that came close to my daily requirements. I would suggest these to my girl friends and women family members."
5,Can't Find a Better Women's Vitamin,"I've been taking this vitamin for a few years. It is a pain in the butt taking six giant pills per day, but I feel these pills are packed with all the vitamins I need. I can't find a better one for women my age....BTW, I'm 28....I'll take the vitamins regularly for a few weeks and then stop---because I'm just not one of those people that can remember to take pills consistently. I can honestly notice a difference if I stop taking them. I'm definitely sluggish. This vitamin gives me energy and I feel it helps with my concentration. The taste of the vitamins is nasty to me even if I take them with a glass of water or juice. I prefer to swallow them whole in a spoonful of ice-cream or chocolate pudding. This way I don't get that nasty taste in my mouth and the six pills are also easier to get down my little throat."
4,Great pills,"I have been using these vitamins for a couple of months and I have to say that I like them. I originally bought them because they are natural and can be used with birth control. The daily serving suggests taking 6 pills per day, which is why I knock them down 1 star. I would have preferred a one-a-day. However, I have only been taking 2 a day and things seem fine. You might want to check out the daily doses to determine if these are right for you."
4,OK,After taking this product I beleive I feel better and more energetic. It is not like night and day however so hard to say for sure if it was do to the vitamins.
4,joy division to the birthday party,"This is a mind blowing concert. The music has muscle rarely heard on their studio work, or for that matter their other live performances that i have heard. The guitars squall, the drums bludgen and Ian Curtis's voice comes from a place i never want to go, but through it you can understand why he had to die - he ment it. The music from this concert, whether intentionly or not, perfectly prefigures the work of the birthday party, if you love this you will love their live recordings, there is no middle ground, you love this or you hate it otherwise you just don't know how to listen."
5,A little information from NMC/Fractured Music,"some quotes from UK media:""....Joy Division were visiting places previously thought to be the exclusive preserve of classical composers. Every new band should hear this. Come on, die fiery."" 9/10. NME""a frightening burst of true soul music that serves to remind the body of what adrenaline feels like..."" ""a striking reminder of a period and a place"" The Independent""raw and resourceful"" Daily MailThis is not a momento this is a gig. This is not a souvernir or shifty best of this is a gig. This is not bootleg chic this is a gig. Just a gig by one of the greatest bands that ever lived, wrote and played."
5,"The ""live"" live album.","I've never heard a live CD like this. The performance is brilliant at times, mediocre at others, the crowd is rowdy, the gear is basically three steps from oblivion, and Ian Curtis is having an off day. Yet, even with all this, it works. It REALLY works. You can feel the energy of the performance... when the synthesizer goes haywire after ""Heart And Soul"", you just want to scream ""Get on with it! "" along with the rest of the crowd. It's that vivid. This is a godsend for those of us, like myself, who were not around to see this incredible band in the flesh. I won't say it's the next best thing, because nothing can compare to seeing a great band live, but it's pretty damned close."
4,"Finally, a decent recording of this gig","Many of JD's gigs were supposedly recorded from the soundboard, or so I've been told. Hopefully ""Preston"" will be the first in a series of live JD material. As far as the actual gig goes, Preston 28Feb80 was not the best. Ian sounds fatigued but is more talkative between songs than usual. A fumbled start of Disorder, a missed chord on Transmission. What are you reading my comments for anyway? Either you'll want to hear this gig or you won't. You don't need my convincing. Those who relish JD live material will find this the best quality recording they've heard of Preston Warehouse, and Incubation on this date is particularly menacing, but seek out a copy of Amsterdam's Paradiso gig as well."
5,Best Value,"When you add up the separate costs of the headset, 200 Microsoft Points, Uno, Robotron, Camera, and one year of X-Box live, you will see why this is such a good deal. Large big box stores still sell this package for $80 which is still a bargain but at $65 you can't go wrong. Even though you probably already have a headset, it never hurts to have a spare. Great picture quality on the camera as well. Thanks Amazon."
5,Awesome deal for the price,Picked this up on a deal through Amazon and was the best purchase at the time for the money. Now granted the XBL camera is pretty useless now these days so I wouldn't recommend going this route anymore for just the 12 months of live...there are better deals on just the LIVE cards now.
2,No 12-Month Membership Included,"This would have been a great purchase. I mean, an Xbox Live Gold membership is about $50 on its own. However, the codes redeemable for this were taken out before I received this bundle. Also, there were no codes included for free games and 200 MS points via Xbox Live Marketplace. These were all codes included when the game was new. Obviously, this diminishes the value of this bundle substantially."
4,Great bundle - camera 'nifty',"If you are considering an xbox live 12 month subscription, this bundle is a steal. Although there really isn't too much you can do with the camera in terms of games (good games anyway), a Gold membership is required to use Video Chat - so these two products tie together nicely."
4,It's one of the best deals out there!,"We purchased this because you get so much stuff in this bundle for a reasonable price. You save money on the Gold Membership and the camera and it's practically like getting the 200 Microsoft points and headset for free. When you price it all out seperately, you find out that it's an excellent deal."
4,"Nice package, just wish it was wireless.","Bundle comes with a camera, headset and 12 months of Xbox Live. Everything works great, I just wish they were wireless. I have the Xbox Elite and all my controllers are wireless... I hate having one lonely cord draped across the living room."
4,Great Bundle,"The camera and Xbox live subscription are worth the price. Only drawbacks are that XBL you need to find good gamers in good servers and the camera is used by only one game. However, the bundle is worth it when you find good games online and put the camera to use."
1,Junk,"It is Junk....just another useless piece to put on the shielf, does not work......please don't waste your money on this junk"
1,Not 2in I.D. as stated.,The writeup claimed 2in I.D. and it wasn't.The instructions say to bend the edges if needed for a snug fit.If it actually was 2in I.D. it would have been a tight fit.Another piece of junk on a shelf now.
5,Rusby Casts A Spell,"There are so few truly strong, spell-weaving folk-based young stylists in the singer/songwriter/groupleader realm these days. In the U.S. it's Judith Edelman on albums like ""Only Sun,"" and in the U.K. it's Rusby on ""Sleepless"" and ""Hourglass"" These are artists whose albums are real listening experiences--all the way through. Remember when that was the reason to buy albums!"
1,Just a bad CD,"This has to be the worst CD I have ever heard or purchased. Sleepless is a great name for this effort, just the thought of playing this would give me nightmares and cause me many sleepless nights. It's not that Kate has a bad voice, it's the poorly arranged songs and the way Kate delivered each effort. No emotion whatsoever!!! It was as if she spent a day or so recording each track, then slapping everything together on a CD and then delivered the bunch to the music stores. The best darn song on the CD (The Cobblers Daughter) was completely ruined by Kate. I would really love to hear Connie Dover deliver this song on one of her upcoming efforts...the result would be mind blowing!!! I have a rather extensive Celtic collection with artist ranging from Connie Dover to Loreena McKennitt, to Karen Casey and Mary Dillon of Deanta. Unfortunately, Kate can't compare to any of them."
3,"Good story, okay acting, some nonsense, but overall fun","I downloaded this movie on a whim and was satisfied. The story was interesting and I couldn't predict how everything would unfold. I am intrigued that this was made in the early 1980s because many plot elements were probably thought to be sci-fi, while they are quite plausible today (except for the symptoms of the disease). I wasn't impressed with some of the acting, and there were a few gaping plot holes where anyone with a modicum of common sense would've acted differently. But if you view this expecting a diversion from boredom rather than something deep or terrifying, the acting and plot holes won't be too distracting. I was kind of disappointed with the ending, as it seemed like everything just wrapped up too quickly and cleanly. This was so overt, perhaps it was done for effect - but I didn't like the effect. Overall, a good one to watch if you like secret-bio-base thrillers."
5,A really creepy movie from the 80s,"The story is pretty good for a ""B"" movie, and the underground scenes are really creepy, especially if you watch this at night. This movie does not have the best actors in the world but there are many you will recognize. However, it's a good script and well directed, and a timely subject (dangers of genetic research for warfare purposes). I recommend it for your DVD collection if you like sci fi and zombies running around a secret facility."
2,Not worth paying for that's for sure.,"I wouldn't recommend paying for this old, very average at best movie. Nothing great here and can't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews."
4,Germ Warfare & Bio Terror,Warning Sign is a good little Sci-Fi Horror film done in the 80's with a solid cast and good story revolving around Bio Terror and Germ Warfare. The movie has some nicely done moments of terror good for some jolts. This needs to come out on DVD and soon.
3,exciting and believable,first saw this movie on shelf at video store have rented it twice and find both the idea and reaction of people involved very scary could this be really happening today .most of us would not want to know what is really happening outside our little area of realality
4,"Works very well, but..","It seems to work very well, but it takes forever and a day to melt it with a mapp torch. I will try it like somebody else suggested. Melting it in an old tea pot. Problem is that my driveway is huge and the cracks are wide, so it will take too much of this stuff to sufficiently fill them all. If it was a small driveway and small cracks, I think it would be an excellent choice. I am getting bids from asphalt contractors to use the hot crack filler. It will probably end up costing about the same or less. I just wish they made sticks with a larger diameter. That's the only reason I am giving it a four instead of a five."
1,Not Magnetic,There is nothing magnetic about this tape. It would not attract a paper clip unless I placed the clip on the tape; but a slight bump and it falls off. I noticed the 2 reviews that gave this product a 5 said it worked great on paper and photos. Enough said.
1,Waste of Money,"It claims to have a strong hold, yet the item did not hold a small piece of cardbpard (like a post card) to the fridge. I filled the entire back with tape and it still just slid right down to the floor."
2,magnetic tape,"very poor magnet, I would recomment only to attached a sheet of paper to the frig. I probably should have ordered a much thicker material"
1,It's My Turn,"Great picture book, my son loves it. However, while reading this book, the characters sound like two spoiled brats. They only learn how to ""play together"" in one sentence on the last page. The other pages are ""NO, it's not your turn, it's my turn"". I think this is horrible to teach a toddler. Since my son loves to be read to, he listens to every word I say. I have used black marker and changed the words to, ""Yes, it's your turn now."" I think this makes a much better impression on my son, and he is not running around telling other children....""NO, IT'S NOT YOUR TURN...IT'S MY TURN."" Just terrible for a toddler book, since toddlers are so impressionable."
5,Gift for grandson,I received in timely manner - as expected. Given as a gift to my grandson. Asked his dad if he was using it and he said it was perfect as it kept everything together.
2,has some funny moments,"although i wouldn't call this movie a laugh riot,i did find itamusing.and i did chuckle a few times.some of the slapstick is fairlyfunny.and it is essentially a silent movie.there is one audible wordword uttered in the whole movie.there is some music and soundeffects,as well.but otherwise,for all intents and purposes,it's asilent movie.making a Silent Movie in 1976 must have taken quite a lotof moxie,so you have to hand it to Mel Brooks for that.i guess itdidn't hurt that he got some big names of the day to agree to appear init.still,it's no masterpiece,but it's a step up from History of theWorld Part I,which i had watched just prior to it.for me,Silent Movieis a 2.5/5"
3,Not the best Mel Brooks but it is Mel Brooks,"It was fun to watch this movie again. I had seen it as a child, so I did noteven know who all the stars were. Looking again, I noticed lots of actors, likeJames Cann that I did not even know when I first saw this film. Not the funniestMel brooks film, but it has a very unique feel to it. If you've never seen this movie,I suggest you rent it before deciding to buy, unless you are collectingall of Mel Brook's works. The same goes for Mel Brook's 12 chairs."
4,What's He Saying?,"SILENT MOVIE isn't one of Mel Brooks greatest movies. However, neither is it one of his worst. SILENT MOVIE is more of a homage than a spoof to the movie genre that just doesn't exist anymore. The film has an interesting (funny) enough plot with all sorts of visual gags and lip-reading one liners, yet at the same time the movie does evoke the silent movies that it pays homage. The action of the film is spaced between with scenes of Mel and the gang riding around in their car. Anyone who has watched a lot of silent movies (or any theatre for that matter) knows this is just how lengthy films (and plays) used to be made, having silly scenes of comedy breaking up the tension of the plot. The highlight of this film is the scene with Marcel Marceau; it's totally fitting that the only spoken words in the movie are spoken by the world's greatest mime. A must-have for the Mel Brooks fan and a good gift for anyone who likes silent movies."
5,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!,"I think this movie has a great sense of humor, and I also like this movie because it was directed by my favorite director Mel Brooks. PS if you are Mel Brooks, U ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!."
4,A Region 1 DVD is Coming But Right Now Only Available in A Mel Brooks DVD Collection!,"Silent Movie is a hilarious comedy movie. It is coming out on DVD sometime in April 2006 but at this point there are no seprate DVD releases and you have to buy it in the Mel Brooks boxset collection which also includes Robin Hood Men in Tights, High Anxiety, The Twelve Chairs, To Be or Not to Be, Young Frankenstein and The History of the World Part 1. Right now this is the only way to get Silent Movie on a region 1 DVD but I am sure that eventually they will release it seperately."
3,Very Underrated,"I liked this movie, but I wouldnt call it one of Mels best of the best, however I would call it very underrated.There may be no dialog except for one word by Marcel Marcuo. But it is very well done for a silent comedy.Mel Funn is a Hollywood screen writer/producer but his reputation has been destroyed due to his past problems with alchohol. But he has sobered up and has an idea for a silent movie. He takes his idea to a movie studio who is struggling to stay alive and trys to help out the studio by making his movie a blockbuster, which he will do so by getting some of the biggest names in Hollywood to be in his movie.Actors in the film are Mel Brooks, Dom DeLuise, Marty Feldman, Burt Reynolds, Lisa Minelli, James Cann and more.Mel delivers some very humourus moments and his classic trade mark comedy approach in this excellenty made silent movie.Too bad there's no bonus features except for the trailer. An audio commentary would have been nice... maybe a silent commantary??"
3,The Thing Is...,"Now, before I start, I have to say, that at times, I can have the attention span of a three-year-old, and other times, I have the attention span of someone my age, which is a fairly long time. The idea for this movie was hysterical, but I don't believe that it was wise to fully carry-it-out. Though I highly respect Mel Brooks and his work, this was rather silly. I enjoy silent movies with Charlie Chaplin, but perhaps that is because dialogue is more frequent in Chaplin's films. It was hard to watch such a comic genius be silent for virtually the whole movie. Though there were some hysterical scenes, the movie seemed awkward and just didn't work. I will always respect Mel Brooks for being so original and even attempting to do this movie, but it just wasn't in my taste. I would reccommend this movie to anyone that can handle a truly silent movie."
1,Movie,My husband's dream was to watch this movie. I know it was cheap to buy it but I do regret it. I guess the jokes at that time made us laugh a lot now it just gets us mad. I don't think it is a must movie.
3,Words cannot describe this film.,"Pretty good Brooks film, but without the hilarity of his others. A satisfying rental, but not one for the shelf."
3,Another By Brooks,"It really is a silent movie. An OK Mel Brooks movie from the seventies when he seemed to be churning them out. Not bad, but not as good as the others. Worth seeing."
3,Bad publishing,"I'm writing this review to warn people away from the new paperback edition of this book -- 1998 edition from the Delta divison of Dell Publishing.It has so many copy editing errors in it, one wonders if anyone looked at the text before it went to the printer. I wish I'd purchased a used, older edition. The extraordinary number of errors really detract from the readability."
5,Not Just a War Novel,"An honest portrayal of two different types of male hero. Both men are uncompromising in their philosophical approaches to life and love. Private Prewitt often lets his ideals get in the way of immediate gratification. Sargeant Warden, on the other hand, pursues the larger picture. He bends and breaks rules in order to achieve his goals (which are usally admirable). Jones superbly depicts these men and sheds light on what it means to be honest with oneself when living by a strict philosophical code."
5,From Here to Eternity,"This novel ""From Here to Eternity by James Jones is an excellent novel. It grabs the readers attention and then keeps it. I would recommend this novel to anyone from age 15 up and to anyone that has ever been in any type of the military. Jones makes this novel flow with the amazing life of Robert E. Lee Prewitt. This is a great main character because like a hero Prewitt is extremely tough and determined. The novel becomes even more interesting with the secret affair of character Warden and Karen, and many other page turning events. This is a very down to earth novel and it reads quickly and easily."
4,Important historical novel,"The style of Jones' novel lends itself well to its military setting. Jones is a down to earth, straightforward writer who doesn't feel the need to embellish situations with a lot of descriptions or opinions. In this way, he is much like other military writers such as Mailer and Hemingway, though he should by no means be placed on their plateau. The parts of the book that occur in the stockade, however, seem weighed down in philosophy and thus move slowly. The reader gets the feeling that Jones does this on purpose, in order to reflect his own time in the stockade where he had ample time for self-analysis. It is subtle touches like this one that make Jones' novel a definite must read, as a character study, an historical novel, and a regional look at Hawaii. This book should definitely be read by those who loved Michener's HAWAII."
5,Pre-War Army Life,"I never read this book in its first published form and I am glad I didn't let this restored edition go by me. Jones' novel lays bare the life of the pre-war US army and you will find yourself immersed in a complex, very believable (if sometimes strange) world. The climax arrives with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. You will wish a sequel had carried the characters through the war. Some may object to the occasional ""deep"" passages on topics like love and marriage but even if you don't find such philosophizing interesting, the action soon returns. One other irritation is grammar. The characters talk is very convincing as to class and time, but sometimes the omniscient narrator also has trouble with things like singular and plural cases. But that is a minor irritation in a long and convincing book."
4,"So real despite author's disclaimer, no PC in this book","As a military veteran and an officer, I found this book so real. You knew the only way James Jones could write it was to have personally experienced it in the Army. I read it took him 7 years to write it--meaning he had to do lot of soul-searching to get his own experiences into a novel form. One thing that strikes me now is how there is no Political Correctness (PC) in the book regarding Jews, Blacks, Pacific Islanders, Italians, etc. Jones does such a good job of being realistic of that time that I did not take it as specific racism[ as you might find in subtle forms in today's literature because of PC]."
3,ok,never having read the original really could not make a comparison. this book was ok. stupid that tou will not let me say what i have to say wihout using a certian # of words!
5,Epic novel of army life.,"This is a great book about gritty army life, pre-WWII. Don't expect any combat, the Pearl Harbor attack doesn't come until the end and there's not a whole lot about it. Read this for a first-hand account of what being a ""sojer"" was like in the peace-time army in Hawaii. Boozing, fighting, gambling, shack-jobs, whorehouses, and mundane army drills and duties."
5,From Here to Eternity,"This book was amazing. I have to state, for the record, that I read James Jonse's ""trilogy"" out of order and completly inside out, reading The Thin Red Line, after seeing the amazing movie adaptation which is really a compalation of the first two Jones books, then Whistle, and last From Here to Eternity. i was imediatly caught up in the character of Prewitt/Witt and really enjoyed the depth into which Jones selves into his characters, so deep it borders on raw. I read this book at a time when I was questioning many of the same things that the characters were questioning. Another point that I found interesting is the way that he narrates death. this is lost in Whistle because Jones himself died before finishing the book, making for an uneven ending, but in from Here to Eternity he has a strong command of how to reach itno his readers and pull their heart-strings. Sitck with it through its monsterous length. it's more than worth it."
4,Undoubtedly one of the great books about a crucial episode and period of the Second World War.,"Though From Here to Eternity, more than half a century old, is inevitably dated, it is still a thoroughly modern book. It describes, in a way that must have shocked many readers at the time, the human and sometimes inhuman aspects of an army preparing for the inevitable American involvement in the war, in the period leading up to the onslaught at Pearl Harbor which actually forced the US to enter it. Required reading, also for a generation confronted with other wars."
4,"I read the original, and this version was more believable.","I enjoyed the originality. It was interesting that spelling and punctuation was ""off."" I think it was an attempt to capture reginal accents and pronounciations."
1,gauge appears inaccurate,"It seems that these gauges are not very accurate. When I checked the measurements on factory gapped plugs against this gauge and a more traditional blade-type set of gauges, the blade gauges matched the factory spec much more closely than this gauge did.This style of tapered gap gauge is usually preferred, so maybe another make or model would be more carefully manufactured than this particular one.Caveat emptor."
4,Nice accessory,"I think this is a great idea, I hate using the keyboard on my laptop for the numeric keypad, because the keys are not lined up vertically like they are on the keyboard keypads. This is great, it has a USB interface to it is easy to swap in and out when needed, it's not really small, but fits nicely into my laptop case.The only annoying feature about this is that the num-lock key triggers the num-lock for the entire laptop, not just the keypad, which is unnessesary. Its easy enough to just hit the num-lock on it before and after you use it, however it would be preferable if you didn't need to.I would recomend this to anyone who is looking for a keypad accessory. For people who do not have a spare USB port, IBM makes the same exact model as this, except with a PS/2 port, or you can just buy a converter."
4,"Good keypad, annoying trait","I bought this keypad because I don't like using the ""Num Lock"" and then the number keys overlaid on the right side of my Thinkpad's keyboard. Unfortunately, when I hit the Num Lock on this keypad, those keys (U,I,O, etc.) become number keys also. So while this does make data entry really fast if you are used to using a keypad like this, you have to turn it back off before trying to type anything. Besides that, it is exactly what I was looking for."
2,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WIN95 OR WINNT,"This is a USB keypad and is not compatible if you're running Win95 or WinNT. I purchased it not knowing that and have had to return it. If you're using another version of Windows, you'll probably like it - it seems well designed and very portable."
3,"OK, but somewhat boring","Very good image quality and superb sound. Lots of trains. Lots of trains. Lots of same trains. Watching trains nowadays is a redunctant parade of same type locomotives, same color, same container or coal loaded cars in endlesses strings. I like trains, of course, but this DVD is a little, let's say, boring. That's why I gave it 2 and 1/2 stars."
4,Great espresso maker with small footprint,"I was looking for an entry-level espresso maker that would not take up all of my time, money or kitchen counter. This machine rates highly on all accounts! The carafe is a great way to make 4 cups of espresso at once, the milk steamer is very easy to use and clean.This machine makes good coffee (don't expect coffee as good as you get with the several-hundred dollar machines, though!) with very little overhead!"
1,Very poorly engineered product,"Many times, I have read the snooty hype about how a pump espresso machine is better than the steam type. So, I invested $300 in a good pump machine, and now it sits unused in my garage. The steam espresso comes out stronger and richer tasting and takes much less time and effort to make. Give me one of these cheapo machines over one of the fancy ones any day!The problem with this particular model is that it's badly engineered. It can not hold the pressure to do a good job of steaming the milk. Worse, it often sprays coffee and grounds for several feet across my kitchen counter. Sometimes, it literally explodes under pressure and I have to run for cover and then spend ten minutes cleaning up the kitchen. I'm afraid it will kill me someday, so I just ordered a similar unit made by a different manufacturer. I recommend you stay away from this particular unit, even though I highly recommend this type of espresso maker in general."
3,A Fair Hosta Book,"Mikolajski doesn't include a lot of info on hostas here, but what he does write is useful info for the average hosta grower."
1,sugary-sweet and nauseating,"I was really disappointed by this deck. I'd had such glowing reviews from other users, but when I got it I found it to be sugary-sweet and immensely irritating. The ten of cups in particularly irritated me beyond belief. I found the images cliched and sentimental. Not a good deck."
5,The Beauty of Tarot,"I knew I had to have this deck when I saw it... the colors are gorgeous, the drawings are beautiful! This deck has a voice of its own and speaks as soon as it is released from its packaging. A great deck for anyone, it opens the eyes and the mind."
3,Masculine cards,"Better than Waite tho it follows strongly the Waite cards. More intuitive image and colours. My favourite card is the devil that no longers is the pan with chained human beings. The back design is great to the eye too.However, since the cards are so masculine themselves, as a feminist, I cannot connect with these cards."
5,Lovely,"The cards are colorful and bright, very evocative in their design....wonderful to read from if you don't use the companion book."
5,Best deck that I own--keeps drawing me back to it...,"I bought this deck when I first started out--about 7 years ago. What sold me on it to begin with was the artwork and the immagery contained on every card in the deck. Now that she has a new book out on the deck--which will be my next purchase...i fully intend to make use of this marvelous woman's talent and gifts. I also suggest her other book out ""When, If, Why"" to anyone interested in furthering their knowledge in pagens and what they are about. BB to all!"
5,if you don't have this one....buy it!,"the robin wood deck is magnificent: vivid, easy to interprete,pagan in tone, but usable by anyone. this deck is featured in Tarot, Plain and Simple; Tarot Spells; and robin woods new book on the deck."
3,I loved it at first,"At first I would have rated this deck 5 stars, but as the months went by I started distancing myself more and more from this deck. I tend to agree with the others - the deck is too ""cheery"" and ""happy"". I liked the images in the beginning and thought reviewers were crazy to think ill of this deck, but now I'm starting to see and feel what they did. Overall - it's an OK deck. I will probably use it again sometimes in the future, but for now I just put it away."
3,An enjoyable book.,"This was an enjoyable book on many levels-- archeologically, sociologically, and historically. The characters are interesting, particularly Joe and Miss Dovey, of whom I'd like to have read more. I enjoyed reading the ""interviews,"" but felt they bogged down the story and felt the interaction between the characters suffered for it. The ending was well done with an obvious, but not wall-banging, opening for a subsequent book."
3,The plot is a little sluggish,"Mixed feelings about Relics. I'd rate it an average book with good and bad points. As a great fan of Beverly Connor's archeological mysteries, I found Mary Anna Evans' Relics just a little disappointing by comparison. The pace was slow, the plot improbable. Also the main character's chip-on-the-shoulder attitude about her race is a little off putting. I liked it well enough to order a copy of Artifacts, another book by the same author. I'd recommend one of Beverly Connor's novels in the Lindsay Chamberlain series if you are interested in archeology, forensics, or crime solving in the good old-fashioned Sherlock Holmes style."
4,Another Great Faye Book,"I so enjoyed Artifacts that I immediately downloaded Relics. It did not disappoint. Once again, the plot was tight and on point. The characters were believable and enjoyable. The revelation to the mystery was a complete surprise to me.The only downside to this book was the number of editing errors; spelling, punctuation, etc.The story, however, was top notch.I look forward to reading Effigies."
4,Perfect for Subtle Bodywork,"I purchased this CD thinking it may have the same flavor as the original ""At Peace - Music from Big Sur"" (now renamed ""Harmony"") by the same artist. Though beautiful in its own right, I found it less suited to an Esalen Massage than the former creation. Instead, ""Return"" is a marvelous collection to play for less flowing types of bodywork. I use it with 'Raindrop Technique' and 'Ortho-Bionomy' especially. It is deeply calming and relaxing, and encourages the client to release into the bodywork in a similar way to ""Harmony"", without the clear Esalen interpretation. Another jewel in my bodywork CD collection."
2,Harness adjustment,We bought this car seat for our 10 month old. It was easy to install got it in real tight but when sitting rearfacing the harness adjustment gets in the way of the seatbelt and you can hardly loosen the straps. I was afraid if we were to get in an accident and I needed to get him out fast I wouldn't have been able too. I even called to be sure nothing was wrong with the seat and Evenflo told me they have to make it difficult to loosen so that not just anyone (a kid) could loosen it but in my opinion I don't feel that is safe. So we took it back and went with Safety 1st which I love and my son loves.
2,Faulty knob and lever system,"Yes, it's cushy, easy to install, and looks great for the price but the levers are almost impossible to use. Knobs tighened the harness OK for awhile but I always struggled with the levers to loosen it. Now after a year and only two major adjustments, the harness cannot be loosened or tightened.Also, the straps are always twisting (but I've always had that problem with Evenflo)-minor issue compared to the harness adjustment problem. For that reason I would not recommend this carseat or any other with similar knob and lever mechanisms on the sides."
4,Dial is a pain but carseat is great!,we purchased this carseat for our son when he was born so we could use it when he outgrew his infant carseat. he grew fast and i was using this seat when he was 2 months old. in rear position the dials are harder to use but after a week you get used to it. it's much easier with a forward facing position. i like the three easy recline postions. i was told by the police officer who checked ours for correct installation that she had never seen a carseat that had straps you could adjust without taking the seat out of the car (a definite plus for me!). my son also will fall asleep in this seat every time we're in the car so i'm certain it's comfortable. we used strap covers for a while because i thought they dug into his neck when he was little but that's just a small price to pay for his safety. i researched carseats for weeks and decided on this one. we're happy with it and are giving it to my sister to use now for her son.
3,Gotta agree with some of the other negative comments,"Overall, a nice carseat - but I also have problems with the lever that is supposed to loosen the harness. I really have to push the lever down hard, and sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. Very frustrating! Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the dial knob is hard to access while the seat is rear facing. I guess for the price I can't complain too much, but my biggest beef is with the loosening-lever. I am going to contact Evenflo to inquire about it. If I learn anything earth shattering, I'll post it so others can benefit from the info."
3,Electric Manicure Pedicure Kit,I have arthritis in my hands and was hoping for a tool to make pedicures easier. This tool is not as powerful as I had hoped.
2,Disapoined,No good as a Pedicure Kit or my toe nails are too tough. Wasted my money on this item. Ray B.
1,No Power for the Job,"This product is very elementary and has no power behind it to do any kind of pedicure job. I was very disappointed in it, it looked good, but is certainly NOT anywhere near a professional tool and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Not the greastest.,Not really that great for pedicures but more for manicures. I was really looking for something that didn't need replacement heads too often but that is not the case with this product.
2,Electric Manicure Pedicure Kit,"I am not thrilled with this product, as it lacks quality and is NOT durable. Attachments are very small and need replacements. Very little power for the job it was designed to do. Since I'm not long on patience, it ended up in the garbage!"
4,Works great,"Got the power and works as advertized. Plus, all the accessories you need or at least i do. I tried the corded one but his is much lighter and just as powerful with a long life charge. Use if for my nails and in between my toes. Most definitely recommended!"
1,Not happy,I am not happy with my purchase. The ad said it was electric and it is actually battery powered. Tried it and wish I had not purchased it.
3,not as much power as I would like,This product could use a little more power but for the price it seems to work fine. If you are needing to file very thick nails or artificial nails I am not sure this is the product for you.
3,i always tell the truth on items i purchase,"Hi, I've been trying similar products for many years and find that the battery operated manicure products are just no good at all for me. I may as well use an emery board. This product, while not very strong, is good and does the job quickly. My problem is enlarged toe nails that can only be cut by a podiatrist. Using this product over several times solved everything, and I now don't have to hide my toenails. merrilyninforesthills pussycats2@verizon.net"
2,Not a Real Tool... For Play Only,"For that much money, I expected a REAL Tool with Real Power and Serious Implements. This is a toy!"
2,Works great - for a year.,I received this about a year ago and it worked great....but now it does not hold a charge at all and is not usable.
4,Quality Review of Theology,"I also bought this book for a introduction to theology class I have to take at school and it along with McGrath's book are two of only a handful of books that I have not immediately sold after the class was over. This book has been a great resource in helping me to better understand the different theological topics. Also, it is nice to have a reference to turn to when you are unsure of issues in theology and this book is just that. Though, it is long, it is manageable because of the usage of the book as a resource."
4,Enjoyable,"In recent years, any number of systematic theologies have been written by Evangelicals. Stanley Grenz is a moderately conservative theologian and his book is a welcome overview of Christian theology from a Baptistic perspective. One of the best features of this book is that the discussion is clear and thorough, but never simplistic. Grenz achieves this by focusing on the Biblical material and leaving the historical discussion to a few key thinkers in any area. This prevents the work from reading like a telephone book, unlike many systematic theologies. In addition, Grenz has a purpose to his work, namely to integrate his discussion with the communitarian aspects of Christianity. Finally, the work is less than 700 pages, making a bit less intimidating than other theologies."
4,Good Book to Have for Research,This is a required text for my university class for Master's Degree. It is very through and a good reference book for reading or research. Grenz is a reputable theologian and covers the material very well.
3,Nostalgia strikes,"A long time ago I got to see Lauren Bacall in ""Applause,"" and then got to direct the show while in college. Buying this was really a stroll down nostalgia's path. Recorded way back when, it is, like most broadway cast recordings of the time, just the big songs. There are no reprises, or small songs. I like it."
3,Caution,"Indeed, it may be well acted and solid story, but because of the sad realities portrayed in the movie, the viewer should be in an emotional place to handle them. Poignant yes, but may not be suitable for someone who suffers from depression."
5,Will we ever see a widescreen DVD? PLEASE?!?,"I can't say it better than the many reviewers here have said before me, so I can only add my request for a proper widescreen treatment of this terrific hidden treasure. Load it with extras and I'll be even happier, but the entire original picture would be enough to satisfy me."
4,a good solid film,i saw this film years ago and it was a good film.it's the power of two friends.Mark Harmon was alright but the Genius of Jodie Foster makes this film a worthy view.
5,The friend and the mentor,"What happens when you recall the past? What happens when you recall the past and realise you did not become what you always believed you were supposed to?This film is about finding your way through life and about having second chances at doing that.It's about true friendship and how the death of someone special can make you review your options and change your life for good. It's about past and present come together.For a long time, Katie's (Jodie Foster) last wishes have been my favourite movie quote. It truly touches your heart and leaves you wanting to live your life to its fullest.Great oldies soundtrack."
4,A good movie to watch on the weekend,"I really enjoy this movie and like to watch it on the weekends when nothing else is planned. This is a movie that has great actors in it such as Jodie Foster, Mark Harmon, Jonathan Silvermann and others and the scenery of the New Jersey shoreline is absolutley beautiful. I enjoy the way the movie unfolds itself, it dosen't rush things, but takes its time as Harmon who is the main character does flashbacks to his teenage years and remembers his adolesence with the girls he loved. Silvermann is great portraying his teenage friend, and I really thought the scene where he finally gets his fantasy with the older woman is hilarious.I really like this movie and highly recommended it to all who enjoy a charming plot and good acting."
5,Wonderful Viewing material,"I remember renting this in highschool, before I moved to Europe for a year... I found a poster at the video store, generally loved the movie. 3 days ago I came across it, there was no question, I had to purchase it. Watching it now is incredible! It was a movie that always stayed with me and seeing in a more mature light, allowed me to appreciate it and cause reflection on my own life. But a question... In the final scene at the ballgame, is the guy that plays Joey from Friends sitting in the row behind Harold Ramis??"
5,One For A Lifetime,"Not only is this movie touching but the music is brilliant. David Foster adds 10+ stars! What a compliment of great directing and composing. I first saw this movie in the early 90s, I still watch to this date on the 'rainy days'. You must get the soundtrack, it's like watching the movie all over again. Thank you for such a wonderful film!"
5,sad but happy beautiful movie,"the story of a man named billy wyatte and how since his childhood, his childhood babysitter and life long best friend katie chandler has been the one person whos known what he is and has always been there to make sure hes reminded. they absentmindedly fall into their own livelyhoods and drift apart, katie into 2 failed marriages and billy into a short time in the minor leagues and then into a worthless life without much to live for. This is all suddenly changed when billy gets a phone call that katie was found dead from a suicide at the beach house theyd shared their memories at since they were kids. Billy is resposible for her ashes but to know what he should do with them hes going to have to go back to his memories to find katie again."
1,don't waste your time,"The only redeeming feature of this movie was that our side comments during the show were hysterical. Story line was marginal, believability was nil. Couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. Definitely a weak show and a waste of two hours..."
2,A MESS!,"For a brief time years ago, one of my local stations ran two dueling-critics shows - ""Siskel & Ebert"" and ""At the Movies"" - right next to one another. One week, both shows reviewed this film. Gene and Roger gave it two thumbs down - WAY down - but Rex Reed and Bill Harris liked it! Now, I had to see the flick for myself to see which pair was right!As it turned out, S&E were. The film was, and is, a flaky, sappy, screwy, half-baked, muddled MESS. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is for the bits of wild unintentional humor, and for the excellent performances of Harmon (in a thankless role), Foster (simply luminous) and McLaughlin (best actor in the film)."
5,Guilty pleasure movie,I am a huge NCIS watcher and it is fun to see a younger Mark Harmon play a very different role. If you take the movie for what it is and when it was made you will really enjoy the story line and the characters. Very heart felt.
4,Reflection,"The first time I watched this movie was in the early 90s and I was deeply touched. Enoughed that I realized after watching it recently that inadvertently a year ago I wrote a short story using the basic plot. I purchased the DVD after a long-time friend committed suicide and I was searching for answers regarding her death. I didn't get them, but the movie offered some comfort and made me continue to respect the beauty of life. If any art can help someone do that, then it's accomplished a lofty goal."
5,TOO MUCH TOO PUT INTO WORDS,"In the 1000 words it says I have, I wouldn't even begin to be able to share how I feel about this movie and how it has affected my life. I wouldn't have enough space to write about how I listen to this movie or watch it almost daily or have even visited locations from the movie (Chestnut Hill, Margate, ect..) I first saw this movie when I was about 9-10 years old and am now 23."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BUBBLE MACHINE!!!!,I bought this bubble machine for my daughter! The tail that goes up and down gunks up easily and then the bubbles don't work! Worked great first few days! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
3,bubble maker,I was disappointed- battery only lasts a short time. My daughter still enjoyed it. david
1,terrible,"I was very excited to buy this toy for my daughter. she loves Dora. She could barely wait to come home. Machine works very loud, blows one bubble at a time.. didn't blow at all after a few minutes. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!"
1,Lame Bubble machine,"I bought this bubble machine cause it looked cool and my daughter likes Dora. Unfortunately, that's about all it's good for. When I put the batteries in it didn't work at all. Lame. Don't waste even a penny on this stupid machine. Really, I don't understand how it is even legal for companies to use non-biodigradable material to produce toys that will just end up in the landfill."
3,The deliciously funky Ramsey is all there but Miss Nancy ...,"The big surprise here is the long time creative mind of Mr. Ramsey Lewis and his funky gem here is the second CD track ""Truthfully"". Lewis formula is rather simple but deliciously effective - funky piano, bass & drums. Now, unfortunately, my longtime dearest of dearests does not show good. Maybe some vibrato and note extension lack seems to show her voice is not the same. All that acid tough and delicious phrasing that has been the Miss Nancy registered mark seems also to be vanished. This a just for Lewis & Nancy fans CD."
2,There are only 2 start to finish STILL LIFE demonstrations,Great concept but poor construction... STILL LIFE should be part of the title so those of us unfamiliar with Donald Clegg would know that's his area of interest. He needs to add some COLOR to his life instead of SO much BROWN in every Season! There are a few recipes tucked in here and there which was cute and there MAY have been some worthwhile tips that I was unable to get past the dreariness of the book to find... A once through was all I could do before writing this review... into a box of discards it goes...
4,classic,"great entertainment. most people wish they could do this to their bosses -- hold him/her hostage and take over. All the lead actress are funny -- great comedic timing and chemistry. the audience is involved throughout the entire story. we really feel as if we are in the sitution with them, and thus, we are rooting for them. good times."
5,9 to 5 review,Even though this is an old movie we thoroughly enjoyed seeing it again. Watching brought a lot of good memories.
5,A Funny film,"This Is A Film That The Whole Famliy Can Enjoy.About The Movie/ This Film Stars Jane Fonda: Who Plays Judy Bernly, lily Tomlin: Who Plays Violet Newstead, Dolly Parton: Who Plays Doralee Rhodes & Dabney Coleman Who Plays Mr. Fanklin hart Jr.. This film is about three hard working women Judy, Vilolet & Doralee who is treated bad by thier boss Mr. Franklin Hart Jr. mr. hart had viloet get him some coffe one day and she was really pissed that she acidently put rat poison in his coffe. Mr. hart's desk chair was broke and he fell and bumped his head. meanwhile when violet found out that he fell that she also found out that she accidently put rat poison in his coffe. she thought she killed him and thats whenn all the good stuff happens. You gotta check it out and find out what happened. Don't forget to check out the DVd & Soundtrack to the movie"
5,9 to 5 is great,"I bought the video for my girlfriend who had never seen it. I saw it when it first came out and I thought it was great. After watching it, my girlfriend had the same opinion. A terrific movie."
4,YOU MUST HAVE THIS MOVIE ON DVD!,"Possibly one of the best black comedies ever made, Tomlin steals the show as the murderer...I mean murderess Violet Newstead. It's not just hysterically written, it's also completely obvious that this movie was tons of fun to make. If you like dark comedies like ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" you'll love ""9 to 5"". I've been watching a copy of a copy for 10 years & it is so great to see it as crystal clear as the day it was made. Dolly, Dabney, Jane, & Lily deliver fantastic performances throughout and all I can say is ""atta girl""!"
1,Be warned - This is the FULLSCREEN version,"Just a word of warning. At the time of this writing (April 5th), Amazon has this incorrectly listed with a 1.85 : 1 ratio (widescreen). That is NOT the case. This is a 1.33 : 1 ratio (fullscreen) DVD. I didn't find this out until the DVD showed up and I looked at the back. Fortunately, I hadn't unwrapped the DVD yet and can utilize the return process, but be warned."
4,Fonda Won't Shut Up,The movie is fabulous as are the extras. The only negative is that Jane Fonda hardly lets anyone else get a word during the commentary.
4,"Clever, Creative and Funny!","Lilly Tomlin is hysterical in this movie. She makes this movie. It' fun, and your rooting for the women all the way. One specific part is not for the kids. My kids were bored with it. But I enjoyed it from the release date and it's still entertaining."
4,Love this movie!,"This is one of my all time favorite comedies. It's a great watch, full of great one liners and crazy situations."
5,Songs for Beginner to More Advanced Players,"This is one of my favorite Mandolin Books. I taught myself with just this book. Mine came with a flexible record so I could play along with some of the songs after I learned them. I can't tell if this current edition has anything like that. I learned from the ""Tabs"" which is fine, but I did start to use them as a crutch. I recommend learning how to read notes if you want to advance beyond this book. The songs are very fun to play, starting out very easy and getting into some more difficult pieces. I can't remember if the book mentioned the up-down picking. My music teacher told me that much later, which helped me ""pick"" even faster. I wish there were a Volume II with more Bluegrass songs."
2,0 to 100 In Nothing Flat,"This is not a good beginners mando book, and will most likely only lead to frustration. It may be a fine companion book for intermediate to advanced players for learning fiddle tunes and picking standards. Its introduction to chords starts with the advanced bluegrass chop chords. Even as a life long guitar player I found these chords are extremely difficult. They should start with 2-3 finger open position chords. This book is an example of how not to teach beginning mando. It would be like a math book that spends one page on addition and subtraction, the next page on multiplication and division and then goes straight to algebra and calculus. This is not how people learn. Start with a Mel Bay or similar beginners book which takes it one step at at a time."
4,nice product,"The filter arrived in time and was really easy to install. It fit snug enough but it still had a little space on the four edges in my 2002 land rover discovery 2, it made me feel a little uneasy. That being said it makes the vehicle breathe easy."
3,Won't know til next year...,"Just put in to try to give a fall boost for SPRING GROWTH. Some crappy soil needs a boost, so trying to help out a little now, in the MN Fall...***Still not sure - the grass is very happy where the spike went in the ground - lots of new growth on the pines - and others, but is that becuase of the extremely wet spring thus far in MN?? Didn't hurt - I know that for sure!fyi, I used a 2x2 stake and pounded it into the ground to create a hole first, then dropped the spike into that. Otherwise, the spike gets pulverized trying to drive it in by itself, with that silly little plastic cap on it."
2,"Good, but not great...","This is a funny film which is easy to like. Whoopi does raise above the pretty basic material, her mouth has always been a problem for me, especially since it wasn't necessary to the film. Watch it on TV only. But the ending saved it for me, Jack's appearance was an excellent visual twist."
4,Why are we still waiting for this on DVD?,"JJF is a great film from 1986, extremely funny and made Whoopi the star she deserved to be. Whoopi plays a bored officer worker who sits behind a computer all day wishing for a better life. Oneday she starts receiving messages on the computer screen from a spy needing help. How can she ignore these pleas as they also offer some excitement into her life. Add Carol Kane and James Belushi to the cast, and you have one hilarious film. One question that begs to be asked is: why are we still waiting for this title on DVD? It's long overdue - the film distributor should puts their skates on and release this ASAP. My old video copy is worn out."
4,"A charming, funny, action-packed, and romantic movie.","This is a really charming film. It is the only movie that I have watched repeatedly and I don't know why the official reviewers have been so critical of it. Whoopi Goldberg is very funny, the plot is action-packed, and director, Penny Marshall sets up a lovely ending. It has aged well and is still a great way to spend an afternoon. Despite the R rating, it works just fine as a family movie."
5,Dogs barking can't fly without umbrella!,"I am so excited one of my all-time favorites has finally been released on DVD. ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", along with ""Ruthless People"" are my two favorite 80's movies. I must respectfully correct one reviewer and report that there is a theatrical trailer on the DVD. But some of the scenes were cut out of the film, and that was a bit of a disappointment because they looked real funny. Full screen & wide screen are available. Everyone has seen this movie so I won't detail it, just wanted to say it is great!"
5,JUMPIN' JACK FLASH. ITS A GAS GAS GAS!,"Critics really loved to trash this movie... Well they're all wrong. Jumpin Jack Flash was Whoopi Goldberg's frist comedy film and I think to this day it is one of the best films she has made. I guarentee you will love this one! With Penny Marshall as director, you can't Miss!"
4,An 80's Classic,"Am I the only person out there who, upon watching it for the first time, thought that Jonathan Pryce had the very best voice in the entire world?Once the audio kicked in, during their ""instant message"" exchanges, I was hooked.To this day, I still watch it just for the basic romance.And, of course, to chuckle at what what so very, very high-tech back in 1986!"
4,Wonderful classic movie,"This is a classic. If you like comedy with a little bit of mystery, this is the movie for you."
5,I'm just going to buy it...,"& save myself the cost of renting over and over and over... I don't care what the critics said, this movie is hilarious! The supporting actors are great but Whoopi is a standout. This role really ""turned her loose"" and let her shine. (And oooooh, Jonathan Price's voice. Very sexy.) This movie has comedy, drama, espionage and now, that retro 80's thing going on. I rent it every time I'm sick or just depressed. It never fails to make me laugh."
4,Great movie!,"I loved this movie so I rented it here on Amazon. It was great except it was not very loud. I had to turn my computer all the way up and dig some speakers out of the garage to hear it. other than this minor problem, I would recommend this Movie! +4"
3,"Anyone who hates how arrogant Ranma is, watch this!","This one's pretty good. Ranma suffers a head injury via Akane's fists and has a change of heart. He now thinks of himself as a girl, wears women's undergarments, treats Happosai like a human being, and gets excited by clothing stores. There are a couple memorable scenes, one of which involves Ranma-kun (male Ranma) holding a brassiere up to his chest and commenting on how cute it would look on him. The second episode isn't so great. I didn't really catch its point. Something about fighting Happy's partner in lechery, or something. Anyway, the animation is good, the dubbing is mediocre, and the humor is, of course, wonderful."
1,cranked-out tripe,"Like the other reviewer, I was expecting specific visions for a concrete sustainable future and was quite disappointed. Particularly in light of the renown of the authors, my disappointment was sharpened by the poor quality of the essays--- they are airy-fairy pieces of fluff. Some with the addition of overwhelming prejudice; 'don't eat factory-farm chickens' 'be a vegetarian' 'live in the woods' in order to be a good Pagan, but wholly without any sustainability.Thom van Dooren was the one star with interesting ideas and good writing."
3,Too visionary for me,"I bought this book hoping it would be filled with concerete ways that pagans can work towards a sustainable future for this planet. If you too are hoping for a hands-on type of book, then this is not the book for you.Instead it is a collection of very highbrow, esoteric essays by various well-known pagan authors. I found it to be very dry reading and at times I was wondering what the essays had to do with a sustainable future. Take a look at the table of contents...essays like ""The Ethics of Paganism: The Value and Power of Sacred Relationships"" and ""The Sacred Art of Communication"" while worthwhile, in my opinion do not belong in a book about building a sustainable future.If you like scholarly works and enjoyed reading your college textbooks you might like this."
3,not impressed,"I was not very impressed with this one... in fact, I sold it less than a week after I got it."
5,Every artist should read this book,"Awesome book, answered a lot of questions I've had as a artist. We are made to give glory to God!"
1,"Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth","Ehh...I really didn't find much captivating about this book. Throughout the whole thing, Jennifer is shown as a highly mysterious character, and I was so hoping for some kind of big reveal, a supernatural twist, whatever, about her, and none came. There was no big climax, just a steady slope all the way through. I can say that the characterization was very good, placing small details that made you love the characters. But the details were taken too far sometimes, making for some dull reading. Once you finish, you leave the book wondering what the point of it was, only to find that there really wasn't one.Rating: 1.5/5"
3,Jennifer and Elizabeth,The story is about two girls. One girl is a witch and the other girl has just moved to the town. Elizabeth was walking to school one day and saw a shoe hanging off a tree. The shoe looks very old and Elizabeth's shoes' look new. So Elizabeth told Jennifer your shoe is about to come off. Jennifer jumped off the tree and talked to Elizabeth. Jennifer and Elizabeth would meet every Saturday at the library first and then they would go to the park. Elizabeth became Jennifer's helper. Jennifer would tell Elizabeth to eat a weird food every day of the week. At the end of the story of the story Elizabeth finds out that Jennifer isn't a witch she just wants to be one. Elizabeth and Jennifer are best friends
5,The Best Book I Ever Read,I think this is a great book because Jennifer pretends to be a witch and Elizabeth wants to be a witch also. So they do all this witch type stuff.At the end of the story it says that Jennifer wasn't really a witch after all.It shows little kids to be who they really are and not something or someone else and it sets a lot of examples for little kids.
3,Friendship,"A lonely girl, Elizabeth, encounter a ""witch"", called Jennifer, who also is a lonely little girl. This unique and proud little witch shares her magic with Elizabeth by training her to be a ""witch"", too. However, to become a witch is not an easy task. During the process to become a ""witch"", these two little girls have fun, and quarrel, and find out things about each other. I recommend this book."
3,Jennifer and Elizabeth,"The story is about Elizabeth moving in this town where she knows no one, but one day she meets a girl named Jennifer. Jennifer says she is a witch but Elizabeth doesn&#65533;t believe her. Through out the beginning of the story Elizabeth learns its true. Jennifer teaches Elizabeth to be a witch an apprentice witch. Every Saturday Elizabeth and Jennifer meet in the park to learn witchcraft. Elizabeth has to eat one thing every day a week such as an onion, or a raw hotdog. One Saturday, Jennifer and Elizabeth start to make a flying ointment, it will take them about 5 months. One day Jennifer and Elizabeth got in a fight, and Elizabeth came down with a cold. Then one gloomy afternoon Elizabeth thought that she would go and apologize. After that they were the best of friends."
5,"Great playing, but not the best Richter has to offer...","All the performances on this collection are nothing less than wonderful While, by anyone else's standards, thie CD would be a miraculous achievement, Richter has made even greater recordings of these Beethoven Sonatas. The miraculous performances of Opp 109-111 on the Music and Arts CD ""Richter In Leipzig"" make the present Philips versions, distinguished though they are, look staid in comparison. And Richter's powerful view of the ""Appassionata"" is better heard on the Moscow recording available on BMG/Melodiya than on the BMG/RCA recording presented here. For the Tempest, try Richter's recording on Praga, rather than the EMI one available on this 2CD package. No one buying this set would be disappointed, but you could find even greater satisfaction elsewhere."
5,"A Live Recording of Op 109, 110, & 111 - Great Stuff!!!","Yes, the first CD with the ""Appassionata"" is wonderful. However, the real treasure for me is the second CD with the three last sontatas - and a LIVE performance at that. This is what live music making is about. Taking chances - sometimes failing (there are stumbles - BUT WHO CARES!) and yet at times creating miracles!If you love piano playing I don't see how you wouldn't want to listen to these disks over and over again. Each time I listen to them I learn more about the instrument I love. And while I haven't listened to or played as much Beethoven in the past few years as I did long ago these disks have sparked my digging out the music and reading through them again and looking over the last sonatas in depth for the first time."
2,Ames Snow Pusher,"Ames makes other similar pushers. Be really sure that the one you get has a steel wear strip on the business end. The straight aluminum will not hold up to use on a typical concrete driveway. The price seem to be about the same for either one. Be sure you want what you order; I tried to return the one I got. Guess what? The shipping cost was $91. In a nutshell, you will keep whatever you get. I have two now. One has a wear strip."
3,Sharon Tate's final film,"Filmed in the spring of 1969, this comedy about the hunt for a chair that has very valuable jewels in it was to be Sharon Tates final film before the Manson family invaded her Bel Air home and butchered she and her guests. Sharon does a great job in the film and her penchant for comedy was beginning to peak. The plot is a bit weak andthe budget for this film was not on par with her earlier work. Still a must for any Sharon Tate fan. Also, the music in this film really helps the quality. Great late 60s Burt Bacharach type soundtrack. It is sad watching this video as some scenes Sharon looks visably pregnant. Not the best of her short career, but worth it for this final film.Released in early 1970, the film proved to be a box office failure."
4,Damn good movie!,"Jennifer Rubin, Dean Cameron, and the rest of the cast had amazing chemistry that really came through in the final product.This movie is, indeed, a cut above the rest as it doesn't explain everything to the letter as other movies do. For me, that's what ruins the mystery and the chances of me watching it again.What drew me the most to this movie was the soundtrack. Nothing like hearing The Chambers Brothers ""Time Has Come Today"" (during the initial suicide scene and when Cynthia revisited the horror awake and alseep) as well as ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night"" by The Electric Prunes (played as the ambulance took Cynthia away from the scene at the very beginning of the movie).This movie is definitely worth watching many times."
4,Jennifer Rubin is still having...'Bad Dreams',"The beautiful Jennifer Rubin is back in familiar territory a year on from being drugged to death by Freddy Krueger in 'A Nightmare on Elm St. 3: Dream Warriors'. This film is so very familiar to 'Nightmare 3' with it's hospital setting and Freddy-like Boogeyman. Also eagle-eyed viewers may recognise one doctor in this film who played a dream doctor in the original 'Nightmare On Elm St.I personally enjoy 80's horrors like this even if they often seem chessy or uber-gruesome. 'Bad Dreams' is an under-rated gem of a horror film and the effects are NOT bad despite what Mr. Professional critic at the top of the page may say. Only you can really judge for yourself. If you're a fan of Freddy, or effects laden horror/suspense then give 'Bad Dreams' a try, it also has a twist at the end which means at least some thought went into this script."
3,Bad Dreams - good viewing!,"I'm a horror buff from way, way back. And every so often I feel the need to revisit some of the movies from my scare ladden youth, and the film Bad Dreams didn't disappoint. Okay, because its the early eighties and my memory isn't what it was, I wasn't expecting much. But you know Bad Dreams stacks up pretty well against the over-the-top gore films of today. It has a plot, it has blood, it has your damsel in distress, and it has a very cute doctor. So yeah, I'm gonna stick my neck out on this one and say see it, its aged well.P.S. My three stars is actually three and a half!"
4,It is a decent movie.,"Bad Dreams, is a good movie. It is very suspenceful and is worth buying,if you are a horror movie freak like me."
2,A waste of good film reel,"No offense to the actors, but this film isn't worth the tape it's preserved on. What saves this film from the dregs of cheesy horror films are two things: a couple excellent death scenes (two words: the fan), and good actors. If you're a fan of Jennifer Rubin or the incomparable Dean Cameron, you'll be pleased to see these two get a large share of the airtime. If you're looking for plot, though, you'll be sorely disappointed. Cameron would get it three stars, but the general inconsistencies and basic lousiness of the film cost it one of those stars."
2,Ham acting at its worst!,"After watching this schlock, I realized my mistake. I actually bought this nonsense and thought it was a scary movie! Boy was I wrong this flick isn't good enough to scrape mud off the bottom of my shoes! If for some reason this movie is ever bought by anyone for a scare look someplace else. I guarantee you'll be laughing more than actually being scared!"
4,"Sony 305"" Floppy Drive.","I ordered two for my two computers. They arrived without a manual, hardware or cables or instalation instructions. This is an item for knowledgeable computer people. I therefore could not give it five stars. Fortunately I had some floppy cables left from the past!The price of $9.02 each was the lowest I found anywhere on the web. With $8.55 SH+H for two it was a good deal.The drives performed quite well, as expected. Both XP computers had no problems recognizing and installing the drives. They are working OK."
3,Great for Savy Computer Person,"I can only speak for the good name of the floppy drive since any Sony product I have ever purchased has been excellent. Unfortunately, I did not realize this product was an internal drive which requires knowledge and courage for installing the device. There were no instructions for installation but help was available at the seller's office."
2,Missing screws and cable,"Another reviewer pointed out that there is no cable in the box. What is also missing (in my case at least) is SCREWS. I have damaged a few installation holes on CD drives or disk drives because of incorrect screw sizes. You might say you can walk over to a computer store and buy screws. But, most screws come in small plastic packages and there is no way of knowing if the screw will fit or not, unless you rip the package and gently try a few. I have not used the floppy drive yet. So there may be revised review from me later."
4,Marilyn's best as the luminous Cherie,"Long out of print (and undeservedly so), ""Bus Stop"" returns to the video scene and just in time for the current DVD frenzy. Monroe is heartbreaking as kitchy chanteuse, Cherie, who's hijacked by a love-struck young buck played by Don Murray. When Cherie performs ""That Old Black Magic"", she's her own floor-show in more ways than one. Marilyn gives a nuanced romantic and comedic performance. Her sex appeal is, as always, unstoppable. But it's Cherie's heart (and Marilyn's) that seems stripped bare -- particulary in the key scene at the bus stop diner when the camera pulls in for an extreme closeup of Murray and Marilyn. Anyone who can sustain that kind of luminous vulnerability under such intense focus is truly a screen legend."
3,strictly for fans of that buxom blonde,"william inge is not served well in this adaptation of his stage hit which comes off today as more a situation comedy than a serious work. don murray is just plain silly as the callow cowboy, but of course the only reason anybody would watch this movie nowadays is the presence of marilyn monroe, who shines in what is essentially a supporting role. not bad, just not very good."
1,What's the point of this movie?,"I have to agree with ""Keialove"". I can't figure out why everybody loves this thing. It's based on a play by William Inge, but in my opinion it never should have made it to the stage, much less screen. The story is about a woman (MM) who resists the advances of an obnoxious cowboy played by Don Murray, but in the end she realizes that she really loves him. Yeah, sure. She's so lonely, she'll go off with anybody. It's boring and overrated."
4,Mine's a return!,"Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray star in this charming 1950's romantic comedy. The laughs are a little dated now but each viewing is as fine as the one before.Marilyn is as lovely as ever and belts out a couple of old favourites including ""That Old Black Magic""..."
2,Will the Real Marilyn Please Stand Up?,"Everytime I watch a Marilyn Monroe movie I think ""maybe this one will be different,"" but time and time again she is cast in the same role of the befuddled blonde that the studios molded for her. A time or two, such as in How to Marry a Millionaire, Marilyn seemed to strike gold with her penchant for humor, but those moments are rare, and you won't find them in this film.Cherie spends the entire movie fretting over her lot in life with a high-pitched whine, and her cowboy lover hollars and brawls until you want to knock them both over the head.The supporting cast isn't too exciting either, and costume design is stingy. Marilyn goes back and forth between a fishnet horror and a leather skirt throughout the entire movie.The only parts of the movie I really enjoyed were the rodeo footage and the scene where Beau finally gets the tar beat out of him by a fellow traveler."
4,"Tough to like at first, then it's great!!","One thing is a fact here: Marilyn's male co-star is annoying throughout the entire film. Period. He almost ruins the film.However, Marilyn is SO GREAT in this film, that she saves it.Her acting is superb, and she comes across as extra vulnerable.So credit Marilyn's acting skills with making this a worthwhilemovie - definitely worth seeing!"
2,A wretched adaptation of a great play,"Yes Monroe gives one of her greatest performances (the other being in THE MISFITS). However, after directing two different productions of the William Inge's excellent character driven play of the same title, I must say that I cannot objectively judge this wretched adaptation.Gone is all of Inge's carefull character sketches and complex study of human nature. BUS STOP as a story has never been solely star vehicle. Cherie is but a small part of an ensemble cast. Gone in this film version is Dr. Lyman and his resurrection in the hands of the neophyte Elma. Gone too is the sexual dynamics of bus driver Carl and the lonely Grace. The setting change from Kansas to Idaho loses so much of the midwestern heart that drives Inge's central narrative.Again, the film is worth watching for Monroe's fine star making performance, but if anyone has read, scene or produced the heart-breakingly beautiful original play, the movie adaptation just doesn't add up."
3,Marilyn still shones,"As a vehicle for Marilyn BUS STOP is nice, but William Inge's play deserved a better rewrite."
1,"Great film, but there's a lot of picture missing","Anamorphic format sounds good. ""1,85"" does not. This was a Centfox movie and it was made in CinemaScope, which means at least 2,35 to 1, possible even 2,55 to 1, if it was a magnetic stereo release.I would love to buy the film on DVD, but not with the sides chopped off. Back to the drawing board!"
3,Monroe's best work can't stand up to the play.,"Marilyn Monroe gave one of her better performances in this movie. Unfortunately, the movie itself is so lacking. This is especially true when you compare it to writer William Inge's stage version. The movie has completely deleted characters that were too controversial for '50s Hollywood. However, those characters make perhaps the most profound statements on the human condition that the movie loses the richness of the play. The only real reason to see this movie is if you're a fan of Monroe's work. Otherwise, find out if there is a production of the stage play in your area. If you're only knowledge of this work comes from the movie, you're missing most of the story."
5,My review for Bus stop,I actually enjoyed Bus stop since I can relate to Don Murray who would pursue Marilyn Monroe relentlessly throughout the movie and insisted she marry him and even threw her across his shoulder to prove his point which I think was very desperate But in the end true love did conquer all and they were in love
5,coachman,I gave this video 5 stars because it has an ACF Brill bus in it. did not think much of Marilyn Monroe. did like the bus thought and Don Murry's part in it.
4,fun!,"Marilyn movies are great and this one is alot of fun.In it,a CRAZY cowboy chases Marilyn's character around the country,as he has decided she will be his wife..no matter what SHE says!"
1,english please,I am a south african student with english distinctions who was prescribed this book for a class in gender studies. I would appreciate it if the author could rewrite the book in understandable english. It seems to me as though Mr Davis has said absolutely nothing worth reading in as many confusing and complicated words as possible.
5,Lovely Book with Lovely Patterns,"This book has several patterns that I plan on attempting in the next few projects. However, when I was considering the purchase of the book, I was unable to find a complete listing of the designs included in the book (always helpful when purchasing something like this). You can find part of the list, along with correspondeing pictures of the designs at the Beth Russell Needlepoint website under ""Needlepoint Books."" However, in an attempt to help other Amazon-ers, here is a list of the designs:*Compton*Hare*Fox*Woodpecker*Honeysuckle (bell pull)*Flowerpot*Jackfield Rose*African Marigold*Jasmine (with an alphabet to customize)*Pomegranate (rug)*Morris*Kazak (rug as well as bag w/ strap)*Anemones*Owls*Rabbits*Frog &Stork;*Annie Jack*Bird & LeafThe designs really are beautiful and traditional, and I think it is going to make a wonderful addition to my needlepoint books."
3,Interesting but not great,Walther Raleigh seems to have been a very interesting character and that comes across in this book. However it reads like a an assembly of different notes on the figure and lacks cohesion.A reasonably acceptable introduction to the character but I suspect not the best.
2,Couldn't wait to put it down,"Brin is an excellent author but I think he missed it on this one. Glory Season held my attention well enough that I was able to stick with it until the lame ending but I'll be more careful next time I buy a book of this lenght by this author. There were very tedious attempts to describe the strategy of a game I'll never play and the end of the book seemed like the author was getting as tired as I was and just quit. The redeeming aspect of this book was that Brin made the matriarchal society very belevable. As a standard phylum male, I feel that I could have run amuck on that planet. I was not surprised to read in the afterword that Brin based this book partly on his observation of aphid sex. You'll have to read it yourself to understand that comment. KK"
4,An interesting world to explore,"Since I'm not female, I can't really judge how feministthis book really is. My suspicion is that some feminists would have preferred a more radical viewpoint. Havingsaid that, the book still reveals an interesting world to read about."
2,Not up tor Brin,"This is not up to Brin's usual (excellent) standard. Very, very tediuos and gets boring fast. Hands off and go read ""Earth"" or ""Infinity's Shore"" instead."
2,The End does not justify the Means.,"This is a book that I adored until the final let's call it 20 pages or so. The culture of this matriarchal world was painted in an intelligent way without resorting to some form of amazonian fantasy, with checks and balances in their system. The characters were engaging and the over-reaching plot was fascinating... and then the ending comes. What impact would the ending of a Sherlock Holmes mystery have if Moriarity fiendishly clever were to blurt out the details of his plan ala a James Bond villain? What impact the ending of the initial Star Wars trilogy if the Emperor had tripped and fallen down that shaft?The journey of these characters, and what you learn about them, leads towards one resolution, and the ending comes not so much as a 'surprise' as an incredible let-down..... I was heartily disappointed."
2,An interesting premise turns into a tedious plot,"While I am a fan of Brin's other books (particularly the Startide Rising series) this book just seems an unending series of adventures without a rousing conclusion. Whoever did the editing for this book should take a hard look at it again. It's about 250-300 pages too long. Having said that, leave it to Brin to create yet another fascinating world and characters. I was especially intrigued by the mysterious history of Stratos and the way it slowly emerged."
1,Glory Season -- more like glory *months*,"The first 2/3rds of this novel are as good as any current sf out there -- definitely up to Brin's standard, and full of wonderful universe building. But the last third is more than a disappointment, it's a cheat. When a novel is written like a mystery (a socialogical one in this case, not a murder <g>), and then at the end, nothing what-so-effing-ever is done with all of the many hints and plot threads of the rest of the book -- it's worse than being left hanging; it makes one regret all of the collaboration one does as part of the reading process.Highly unrecommended unless you like to read unfinished work."
4,A great adventure book,"This is really more of an adventure book in a Sci-Fi setting. Lots of action, some parts dragged a little bit, but overall it's an enjoyable read. The ending is a little weak and inconclusive. The author seems to be saying that even after all that Maia, the main character, went through, it wasn't going to change the world of Stratos much in the short term. That's fine, but I still would have liked to read a little more about what happened to Maia herself. Three pages before the end of the book, she is in mortal danger, then at the end she is ok...sort of...but it left me feeling kind of empty. A good book if you can deal with the somewhat vague ending."
4,A good Chipmunk Video,"In this video, Alvin has to write an essay about the true meaning of Christmas, which he thinks is all about getting new things. But during the night before Christmas Eve, he gets visits from the three spirits of Christmas (past, present, and yet-to-come) and finds out the true meaning. This is a good video for Christmas."
2,Short recap of 500 years of Roman decline in 200 pages,"Eventhough this is an abridgement of Gibbon'sgreat treatise it is a shame that the subject is treated in such a cursory fashion. Little attention is given to one emperor before the reader is pushed on to the next one.Hadas' edition does give us some of the early history of growth of Christianity, one of the underlying causes of the downfall.All in all, I found myself wanting more detail. After reading this book I felt like a had read the equivalent of a Chinese meal. It was OK but I soon found myself wanting more"
2,Auto Time Setting,I also could not get it to use the feature that automatically sets the time as an NYC resident.
3,Perfect Rainy Saturday Afternoon Movie,"This is the kind of movie I loved to find on TV on a rainy afternoon when I was a kid. It's not really a horror movie but a tongue in cheek spoof of the genre. I was amazed to find a young not yet famous Jack Nicholson in the film with three horror acting kings - Vincent Price, Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff. The flick is directed by famous B scary movie master Roger Corman and everyone involved seems to be having a blast. The movie is very very loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's mysterious and haunting poem but since everything is played for laughs Mr. Poe would probably have a hard time recognizing his contribution."
4,Great cinematic fun...,"The combination of the actors and directors in this film is classic; Price, Karloff and Lorre are a lot of fun to watch and feed off each other. The magic-death match sequence itself is possibly Corman's greatest achievement. Simply unbeatable."
3,The Raven.,"It is a Good movie but not great,It is only worth watching because of Price and Karloff. I prefer them to be in more serious films than this,however since both legends are in this movie it should not disappoint too much.The Raven is worth watching."
3,Dismissable but fairly entertaining,"Not to be confused with the 1930s Universal Studios film starring Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff and concerned with themes of madness and torture, this light weight comedy concerns a battle between warlocks Price and Karloff, with Peter Lorre thrown in for good measure. Silly and dismissable, but rather entertaining."
2,"Close, but not quite","This is somewhat of a hard film to measure because it is not bad, but it is not what it could have been. Vincent Price plays a wishy-washy wizard who is mourning the loss of his wife Lenore when he runs into Peter Lorre who plays a drunken wizard who has been turned into a raven. Lorre informs Price that he has seen his wife at the castle of Dr.Scaribus (Boris Karlof). Price and Lorre, along with a young Jack Nicholson, set off to confront Karlof. This film tries hard to be a comedy with the trappings of a horror film. This film has a great cast of horror veterens that is wasted in a cornball comedy, but this cast also keeps this film from being a total waste and they do make this film watchable. Karlof and Hazel Court are ecspecially good in their roles as the heavies. This is probably the weakest of Roger Corman's Poe films even though it boasts the best cast."
2,Misses the mark,"A raven appears at the home of magician Erasmus Craven (Vincent Price) claiming to be a man transformed by the evil Dr. Scarabus (Boris Karloff). Craven turns him back into human form and is then told that his late wife is alive and well and living at Scarabus castle.This movie is supposed to be campy-funny, but I found it dated and dull. The costumes are out of King Arthur while the dialogue is modern; the plot made no sense and wasn't even remotely funny. It was set, apparently, in the middle ages, yet Price recites the 19th century poem, ""The Raven."" Price played it straight while Karloff was obviously kidding. The whole first hour was a set-up for the ""magical duel"" between Price and Karloff which turned out to be just lame effects and sleepwalking actors. The only thing that kept me watching was a very young Jack Nicholson as Bedlo's callow son. I'm sure the actors thought they were making a tongue-in-cheek spoof, but it's a boring, pointless waste of talent."
2,"A step in the good direction, but still not enough","This cd is a better that their debut album, but their is still some strange musical transitions. The vocal is better and the band begin to show that they can create some good music, but their is just two tracks that caught my attention. The first one it ""The Wake"" and the second is ""The Magic Roundabout"". The rest of the cd is weaker and has the same problem that their debut album, the band is still looking for a musical identity and his own sound. The best was yet to come....Some tracks aren't bad, in fact, the live version of many of them on ""Forever Live"" are far better in their live versions than their studio counterparts. This demonstrate that a bad production can sometimes ruins a good song."
2,Starting to find their stride,"This album is a vast improvement over ""Tales from the Lush Attic,"" which I found absolutely unlistenable. Some would dismiss ""Corners"" as pop, but it's a catchy tune -- one I could imagine Peter Gabriel doing -- and if that makes it pop, so be it. ""Thousand Days"" lays down a groove reminiscent of classic U2. Peter Nichols' voice is improved on this record. The guitarist takes a few Steve Hackett turns and the fretless bass adds a nice touch to several songs. The instrumentalists and writers seemed to have gained more confidence on this album. This album might have sustained me through the prog-drought of the 1980s, but when compared to later IQ offerings and those from other prog bands, it's not that great."
4,Very funtional and simple,Easy way to create two screens as image on from the other. Simple and worked fine.
5,Great !,It is what it is and it worked great for the intended purpose . I would by more of these once needed
3,works great bad shipping condition,The price and shipping were quite appealing when I received the item it had been crushed and bent. This was not the fault of the seller but the postal service. A little patience with pliers and tape and it was ready to go. It works wonderfully the way I expected but.... for further notice get the best shipping option cuz the post office manhandled mine to near death.
1,very bad,"Pretty old and crappy. The internal part even doesn't be covered fully. Besides, it doesn't work and my desktop can not be expanded with two monitors."
5,quick and easy - and reasonable,"I searched all over our mid-sized town for a VGA splitter - the few that I found were way to expensive. This product popped up in an Amazon search. I ordered it, paid a very reasonable price, and received my product quickly. Next time, I'm coming right to Amazon. I highly recommend the vendor, Cables Unlimited, for speed of delivery and quality of product."
5,good product,I am using this product to run a monitor and a flat screen TV from one computer. It works well.
2,"weak signal, but connection ""works""","I was able to split a computer signal to two different monitors. However, the color and image were drastically distorted, probably due to a weak signal. I probably should have bought a product with signal amplification."
2,wrong placed screws,"screws are both input and two output leads, screws must not have at output leads. can not attach by screw. at input lead, right placed the screws. at output leads, wrong placed screws. should be male and female."
4,zulu shamanism,"Here we get a fascinating account of how a Zulu shaman gets called to his profession and what healing and divination entail in the context of South African native healers (sangomas). Mutwa brings in details that I haven't seen anywhere else... for example, how divination bones, the essential aspect of sangoma art, are obtained and how a combination of plants and energy are used in healing mentally and physically sick people. He talks about ancient power objects held in storage by his tribe and about the knowledge, accumulated by his tribe of hundreds of years, of the alternate reality that one can encounter in the bush. Above all, this book allows one to one witness the sophistication of the Zulu, including their techniques for training and retraining the initiate's perception and awareness.This is a valuable book."
4,Zulu Worldview,"I took an intensive course in Zulu twenty years ago.So I was excited to find Mutwa's text. When immersed in a language, one begins to acquire some of the speakers' view of the world, indeed the universe. This is why I read African folklore and wish that more people would start to tell stories that link us together. The text is at times pedagogical, but that is a small price to pay of these stories."
5,"""It's Rock & Jazz""","This CD is probably the most liked by my fans and friends! I think it's because of its driving rhythm and upbeat joyous nature! Free samples can be found at MP3.com/bobsiebert. Also more about my latest CD ""LIVE @ STEINWAY GALLERY"""
1,Very Poor Quality - Completely Useless Software,"If you are looking for a well designed, effective, easy to use, reliable research tool/dictionary for your computer look elsewhere because The Pop-Up Oxford Dictionary of English is pathetic.Avoid this sad sad product. It is completely useless."
1,political bias in definitions,"The definitions and examples of use contain severe political bias.Also, the dictionary is not useful for spelling checking because if you type in the word as you think it is spelled it will just say no. This is unlike other dictionaries that will give you many suggestions of words slightly different in spelling than your erroneous one."
5,Fantastic,"Works just as advertised online or off.It's one of the most ingenious and useful little products I've ever installed. I also installed the Selectsoft Oxford pop-up thesaurus: both programs automatically work together. Both programs work instantaneously when you need a word looked up.If you like these kinds of useful conveniently productive programs you also will probably want to add another ""little"" program: ndx Cards (TruTamil LLC)."
1,iFinger gets obsolete and requires re-purchase of all licenses,The dictionary itself is great what is a high risk is iFinger.I've just lost the licenses for 2 dictionaries I bought at www.iFinger.com on '06 because I've needed to reinstall them under Win2k pro; it seems any re-installation depends on www.iFinger.com willingness to run an online validation procedure which is not available for my products anymore as they've been declared 'obsolete' (?).iFinger instructs their clients to keep backup of registry and product data but is useless because you are tied forever to ther online procedures; if you need to re-install for any reason you'll LOSE ALL LICENCES whenever iFinger decides so!!.iFinger: NEVER AGAINMary
1,"bad one, not recommended","this is a very old crap they are still supplying in the web without update. It interferes with Vista and internet explorer. it would not work. I can not update it, it is useless now.they should provide update with the same license code."
3,I Wanted To Enjoy It More!,"Italian gothics, though slow, are usually rewarding. Not so in this case. While Whisper... has the right look, cast, and even a Pino Dinaggio score, it just doesn't add up. I wasn't scared! Sure, there were a few scenes with some decent tension, but never any real shocks. I'd recommend watching Mario Bava's ""Shock"" or Massimo Dallamano's ""The Night Child"" to see whether this is a film for you."
2,real frights,"It's a pity this movie is practically unknown, 'cause it would be a serious contender to reach the top of one of those ""worst movie"" lists... Intended to be a supernatural thriller, in the end it's only a collection of horror stereotypes, bad actors performing at their worst, embarrassing kitsch moments (yes, those great kitsch moments that can transform a b-movie into a trash cult!), the most disagreeable couple of twin girls in movie history and a screenplay that, lacking any trace of logic and plausibility, manages instead to deliver some tragically funny (alas, unintentionally) dialoguesThe only real frights come courtesy of the scary costumes (pure 1970's-style) the actors wear throughout the movie: a collection of the worst of the worst of fashion..."
3,Anne Rice,Unfortunately I was under the impression that this was a new DVD of Anne Rice's writing/work. It was released in 2006; however this is a video that was actually released in 2000. The advertisement was misleading in my opinion. Be careful. If you are looking for a DVD that showcases current opinions and writings of Anne Rice this is not the DVD for you.
2,"Decent - editing is terrible, product description misleading","The DVD does a fairly good job of highlighting the season. However, the best highlight of the season was missing. I'm referring to the Miami game where Bruschi's TD interception triggered a memorable reaction from the crowd, which celebrated the play by tossing snow into the air in perfect synchronization with Gary Glitter's ""Rock and Roll, Part 2.""In addition; as mentioned elsewhere, the entire superbowl game was NOT on the DVD. The game was severely edited to only include the actual plays. This part ticked me off....I would recommend that Warner Brothers actually include the entire game next time; including the half time show."
1,Not at all what you expect,"This is NOT a DVD about the superbowl! I believe those reviews I read are advertisers writing in just to sell the product.My son bought this to see this superbowl because he is a Panther's fan and this was the only way to see that superbowl.The DVD doesn't even cover the whole game! It is just bits and pieces. The title is NOT HIGHLIGHTS! It says it is the game!Very disappointed and if the return policy didn't suck for Amazon, I'd return it!"
4,A Nice Variety of Music,"I liked most of these songs and thought there was a nice variety of pop and r&b. I liked the remix of ""Maria,"" ""Cruel Summer,"" ""Lately,"" ""Torn,"" ""I'll Be There for You,"" ""All I Have to Give,"" ""Do You Really Want me,"" and ""Everything's Gonna Be All Right."" The rest of the songs were just so-so to me."
2,Good but are there better buys,"After Effects is a good product for the industry, but for a person such as a student, this product is much too pricey. Luckily I have had the chance to work a little with this product without having to foot the bill on my own. After effects doesn't compare to any other graphics product on the market. Its tools help to create realistic quality graphics, which are out of this world. If you have a chance to use this product without paying out of your own pocket, do it."
4,Must buy,"Alien, frist off, is still one of the best alien movies ever made. It changed the way we thought of space. The organal was good, but the director cut is better. It has cool delated sceens and is still won of my faviort movies ever."
4,Masterpiece in suspense and terror,"While Aliens gives you in-the-face terror, Alien relies on a blend of tension, atmosphere and occassional in-your-face terror.It is hard to believe that this film is over 20 years old, it is still as fresh today as in 1979. One would expect the special effects to be poor compared with today's standards, but this is not the case.The film will make you jump so high in parts! A recommendation is to watch it with someone else.DVD SUMMARY:Original DVD is now out of print, but featured deleted scenes and a nice transfer. A new edition is now available which supersedes this edition very nicely ie. It is crammed full of extras!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST SCI-FI FILMS EVER MADE,"I decided to buy this movie because I've read many reviews saying it was a great sci-fi/horror film and after seeing it, I truly believe it is. I personally did not find it as scary as some claim it to be, but very intense. As for the ""director's cut dvd "", it is far more. It includes the 1979 theatrical cut and director's cut both with commentary tracks and a three-part, three-hour making-of documentary. The new restorations are the best I've seen on any film let alone a film from the 70's. I highly recommend it to any Sci-fi fans or fans of movies in general. A modern classic. 9.5/10"
4,Who hasn't seen Alien?,"I'm sure everyone who is looking at this film has either already seen it or one of its many sequels, so I will skip the plot description and get straight to the DVD. The DVD is terrific; it has a lot of extra features that true fans of the movie will really enjoy, but couldn't it have been remastered a bit better? I understand that it was released in 1979, but the picture quality on my copy of The Stepford Wives (1975) is better. The sound quality is also very poor...I had to turn it up very loud to understand what the actors were saying. However, true fans of the film will buy the DVD whether it's good or bad. Purists, take note....this is a shoddy remastering job."
5,AMAZING,"When I saw this movie, i was amazed on how good it was. Everything was amazing, the acting, the directing, the writing, everything was genius. anyone who likes sci-fi or horror will LOVE THIS!!! this is one of my favorite movies of all time!!!"
2,I Couldn't See Anything,"This movie needs more lights!! The only part I could understand was when they were eating plastic cereal in the bright room of ship, but a monster came out of a belly and made me confused. The rest of time was everyone looking serious and sweating; I was confused. Was the air cool keeper broken? Why doesn't anyone tell jokes? When you are serious a joke is very funny and good. In the end the monster went into space (no joke!) and I think it was the monster from the belly - he got big; lots of cereal!!! Two stars - I send three more stars for more lights!!!"
1,This film is a disgrace to sc-fi movies,"Any good sc-fi movies should have an meaningful and logical story, this is exactly what Alien lack. The CGI(if any) and special effect frankly not today's standard which make this film nothing more than a piece of junk. I keep on asking this question when I watched this film: ""If nobody came to this alien planet, how can the Aliens survive in the first place?""(This aliens are not intelligence enough to make any spaceship)If you looked for a film in similar genre I highly recommand you watch ""The thing"" instead. Alien is no more than the psychopath in ""Friday the 13th"" dressing in Alien suit. This film is just a waste of time and money."
1,What do people see in this film?,"What do people see in this film? I am not one for horror films, though I do like this alien stuff. Nothing happens in the film. Nothing. We spent most of the time waiting and waiting for something to happen. This movie could have been cut to half an hour, easy. There is a saying that says that fear is being scared of the unknown, something that the X-Files has done really well.Unfortunately, this film has tried to do this too and has gone too far. Rather than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the special effects are pretty poor. Sure it was a long time ago, so we can't expect too much, but look at Star Wars, which came out around the same time. They were much better than Alien, and Lucas had half the money.Alien is simply a boring film that deserves no credit."
5,Greatest SCI-FI thriller of all times,"Still the best Sci-Fi thriller of all-times, finally arrived on DVD. I have to say that this is the most beautiful DVD conversion I have ever seen. The picture quality is plain perfect, the sound quality also, the menu-system is just magnificent and the extras are also great. The only negative point is that the English subtitles are preceded by the name of the person that speaks and sounds are also subtitled. I think this is a bit silly. This one is definately worth every last cent."
2,Event Horizon's much better,Alien provides some shocks and chills but I found everything too predictable. I knew who was going to live and who would die. I also found it annoying that the cat became responsible for a few the crew members' deaths. I thought Event Horizon was better than Alien because of the acting and the mystery element as to what was causing the events on board the ship.
2,good for its time,its a good movie for 1979 but not for modern day i still enjoyed the movie but it doesnt have the same magic as it did when i watched back in 1979
5,Simply Excellent,I saw this movie when it first came out at the Egyptian 70mm screen in Hollywood. It was completely riveting. Before the show ended about 1/5th of the audience had already fled the theatre. So much for claims that the movie is 'overrated'.If you've never seen this show in a theatre you've never seen it.
4,"Picture Quality is 5 stars, sound is 3.","The picture quality for a film that's 20 years old is outstanding. I was totally impressed. The DVD main menu is the best I've seen, they actually make it fun to navigate through the options. The extra footage is great, really enjoyed it. This DVD has ton's of options, you won't be sad you bought this. The sound is a little lacking, but can be expected from the poor quality of sound that existed 20 years ago. Pop in the Aliens DVD and you'll hear outstanding sound effects. The Dolby digital is great, probably better than watching it in the theater 20 years ago. This is a four star video (due to the sound), but definitely worth buying if you like thrillers and aliens... My one complaint, the transfer between layers is rather obvious, they should do it in a black scene..."
4,Good movie,"This is the movie that started it all, so you've got to give it props. For 1979, the special effects are really good, and if you suspend your disbelief regarding the technology (i.e. the fact that a very advanced computer system is being run on a clunky, ancient monitor with graphics that, today, seem very rudimentary), it's easy to see how this movie spawned such a successful franchise. Highly recommended."
5,Alien review,Can watch this movie over and over the theather verson show a lot. Of deleted scenes. I was also really satifised because it does show parts from pumethesis that new movie they added for the alien serios.
4,"As far as I am concerned, there are only three of these films. The prequel, this one and the sequel.","All three of these films are decent, and exciting survival horror stories. The remaining films are trash though. I do not include them in the lineup."
5,Classic.,This is a must see for any sci-fi or horror fan out there. Or anyone in general should see it. The movie is a classic and really changed how horror and sci-fi are handled today. A lot of the special effects still hold up pretty well too.
4,Very Good Film,"I really enjoyed the movie. It had a lot of suspense and always kept me at the edge of my seat except for the beginning, it was a little slow. The only other complaint is that there was not enough action in my opinion, but then again this is not an ""action"" movie. I am really looking forward to watching ""Aliens"" now because the environment Ridley Scott created is awesome and I have heard ""Aliens"" is action packed."
4,One of the greatest horror movies ever made.,"In my last Amazon review I very harshly critisized another Ridley Scott movie, ""Gladiator."" I am not going to take back anything I said, I hated that movie! On the contrary, I LOVE ""Alien."" This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, with suspense almost intense enough to rival even Hitchcock. (I said ALMOST) Great acting and superb special effects for 1979 make this movie a true winner, and the director's cut is truly well worth owning, very interesting and no boring extras like we find in so many dvd re-releases these days."
5,The Best,"Well, I have just watched (yet again) Ridley Scott's sci-fi masterpiece: Alien. The patient pace of the film taken with its stunning cinematography makes for a veritable visual feast. Scott can turn a clunky shipping vessel into a haunting work of art: his masterful orchestration of light and shadow within a wonderfully drab and metallic set casts the perfect visual mood for the encounter with the 'other.' The performances, too, are simply fantastic. The cast hits a wonderful sweet spot in refusing to over act their parts, rendering the characters surprisingly tactile: they brilliantly animate a minimalist but very competent script. In any case, it hard to find anything to criticize about this film, which is why I think it tops my list of best sci-fi films ever."
4,Not the movie we went to see.,"It was the summer of 1979. The weather was low humidity and no rain. We popped the corn, packed up the kids and headed for the drive in on route 64 to a movie the kids wanted to see. We always waited till the second feature started before leaving, letting traffic clear out. The second feature was a movie we never heard of ALIEN. Little did we know that we had stumbling into a great movie. This is one of the great SciFi-Horror movies of all times. Only its sequel ALIENS is better. This was even better on a big screen TV that watching it in a drivein theatre."
2,"Great Ideas, Glacial Pacing","I appreciate all the ideas and special effects this movie had and its influence on so many movies that followed it. That said, it's a two-hour movie with a twenty-minute story. Each segment of the plot is stretched so thin, and there's a certain inevitability to the story that keeps the pacing from being atmospheric and makes it more tedious."
4,Alien... a classic!,"Very interesting and engaging story. Suspenseful... Creepy, scary! Perhaps the greatest Sci-fi horror movie of all time. I would highly recommend this and it's second installment ""Aliens!"""
4,The beginning of an era.,"It is difficult to write an impartial review of this movie. One must seee it in the time that it was first released. The idea of a small crew ( in space, at sea or otherwise ) battling an unknown monster has been repeated too often. From movies like Alien and Deep Star Six it has degenerated to the level of Virus and Deep Rising. In Alien, the theme was still original and when you look at it as such it is a great movie. The small cast does an excellent job, aided by a strong script an excellent score and good directing and the alien itself is still effective ater all these years. The whole atmospheer of the movie is one of the best ever achieved, as you see the doomed crew slowly succumbing one at the time to the unknown terror. A must for all SF and Horror fans"
4,Very good sci-fi classic....,"This is a modern classic which has plenty of shocks and gore. Slow in places, but the actors and acting is brilliant. Stars Tom Skerrit (Poltergeist 3), Sigourney Weaver (Ghostbusters), John Hurt (Elephant Man) and Yaphet Kotto (Running man, Freddy's dead)It's now considered a cult classic."
4,Often duplicated but never equaled,"What makes Alien a great film is that it took the idea of haunted houses, a fear dating back centuries, and put it in the future. Many of us can relate to this idea; our parents or friends telling us to stay away from 'that' particular house, and with every step closer we would become more and more nervous at what horrors awaited inside. And to make this even more effective, the film takes 'everyday' characters, people we could have known, and puts them into this horrifying situation. Very suspenseful stuff. The specs on the DVD itself are superb. There are many extras including an isolated score, production stills, great 3d interactive menus, outakes and deletions, and even an audio commentary with Scott himself. All in all, with its groundbreaking sets, intense situations and great performances, Alien is a must have DVD."
5,Alien DVD brings a smile to my face,"When the first round of Fox DVDs were released, I was upset. Sure, the sound features were cool, but I want deleted scenes and audio commentaries. Those are the features tha make people want to buy DVDs. With the release of Alien DVD, I found myself shocked by the wonderful features it offered. The DVD took a great film and made it greater. I really enjoyed the commentaries. They were informative and fun to listen to. The deleted scenes also added a great deal of insight that I was surprised about. Even though I had seen the directors cut on a rare Laserdisc from Japan, I still enjoyed this segment because it was on DVD. Well worth the buy. A must for any Sci-Fi DVD collector. For other great DVDs, I suggest Armageddon: The Criterion Edition, Good Will Hunting Collector's Edition, Robocop: The Criterion Edition, and Lethal Weapon 4."
1,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","I recently ordered this DVD, as it is one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies. However, I can't access any of the extra features except one trailer. This knocks the DVD down to one star. The film itself has a wonderful transfer, the clearest I have seen yet. It boils down to this: the movie is great, but that is all you will get with this DVD."
1,Over hyped and just plain awful.,"Completely overrated. I felt nothing for the characters, the acting was plain bad and they kept making one bad alien movie after another with the exact same redundant plot line. I really hope they don't make any more alien movies. It's become an awful franchise like Nightmare on Elm Street. I'm glad they went in a new direction with Prometheus which is a much better film than all the alien movies combined."
1,Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED,This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover Alien is the first version of the movie. Get the special 2 disc its DTS and enhanced.The same this for all the 6-5-07 fox releases. The Dummies at fox did not even notice that on predator its DTS but the new fancy cover say D.D.
2,Alien,"Very poor BluRay transfer, was expecting a lot more in image quality. The story is genuinly fantastic as well as the acting."
4,Great to show off a TV,At $5 or $10 you cant beat this. The original Alien is in my opinion the best in the series and it was more worthwhile to go with just this than the set at $20.
5,"""Not like any SOS I ever heard.""","THE benchmark for sci-fi horror with the most original ""space monster"" in movie history. It still holds its own against modern sci-fi movies which are more about special effects than a great original story, believable characters, suspenseful, great cinematography, and made for one reason only - to scare you off your seat. Plenty of other great detailed reviews but suffice to say I believe this to be the best sci-fi movie made. First time viewers regardless of age will find Alien a refreshingly exhilarating and scary experience. A must own for any sci-fi fan or aficionado."
5,Love!,"I have so many copies of this, but was estatic when it came out on Blu-Ray. The quality is great!"
5,Excellent Blu-ray transfer!,Great movie with excellent video and audio on blu-ray! This is a definite improvement from prior releases. Must have for all sci-fi fans!
5,The NEW Standard In Sci-fi Horror,"Seen in a theater, the film was bought as a video, then bought anew in letterbox. Ridley Scott uses his character acters well, while spending bigger bucks on the story and set designs. As in Jaws, you never see the beast that well -- ever! Their ship soon becomes claustrophobic with the few clues coming from ""Jonesy"" (THIRD officer) Ellen Ripley's cat. Ripley ends up as the last crewman alive to combat this Alien. The ""Professional"" reviews you show tell me more about the reviewers likes and dislikes, than anything about the film itself! I think it is a stunner!"
4,An Excellent Blend of Sci-Fi and Horror,"A futuristic cargo ship accidentally brings aboard an unlikely and unwanted passenger. Excellent visual designs - one of the best in the history of cinema, and an appropriately somber, but yet spooky musical score by Jerry Goldsmith (""Planet of the Apes"", ""Chinatown"", ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture""). An excellent blend of sci-fi and horror with Sigourney Weaver turning in a star making performance. Features the classic - and the overly spoofed - scene of a baby alien bursting out through a crewman's chest"
4,Alien w/ extras,The prior review states it is barebones. That is not true. The individual Alien films are getting released with whatever extras were released on the discs that were in the anthology. The only thing you will not be getting is what is on the 2 supplemental discs. For exact info check out the 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment web-site.
5,Alien,"Simply one of the most innovative, intriguing, and ruthless of its kind, ""Alien"" is still one of the most horrifying, intense, and heart-pounding cinematic experiences of all time. A deep-space mission crewship lands on LV-426 to investigate the surroundings for future residental opportunities, only to let an alien parasite onboard. When the parasite infects the crew members and eventually takes full form, Nostromo spaceship is under a full-force attack by an alien evil that becomes increasingly ferocious and feeds on human flesh. Sigourney Weaver is commanding in the lead position, proving that woman are just as capable of being a hero as anyone else. Stunning special effects and powerful directing from Ridley Scott. A true science-fiction/horror masterpiece. Director: Ridley Scott. Cast: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright. Rated R for gruesome horror violence and language. 116 minutes."
5,I really enjoyed the movie,"I really thought it was a great movie and I would like to see the uncut version. I would like to purchase the uncut version, if any one knows where I can purchase one please e-mail me."
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","In the wake of Prometheus, I wanted to own a copy of Alien (Bluray, of course) and the Director's Cut, to boot. Unfortunately, the DVD is so high-tech that the menu would not disappear after you have made your selection and played the film. It stayed on for the entirety of the movie; I had the DVD replaced by Amazon, which they did very graciously, but the problem remained with the new DVD as well. I guess it's a manufacturing defect, then. Watching the theatrical release, of course, did not contain the glitch."
2,137 minute Directors Cut?,"The movie was great, but I already owned a copy - because I have owned the Quadrilogy pack for quite a long time. I purchased this item, because the description promised a 137 minute version was on the disc. When I loaded up the disc on my player, it is EXACTLY the same as disc 1 of the Quadrilogy pack. One cut is 1:55 and the other is 1:56, neither is 2:17 as promised. Some gimmick about ""deleted scenes marker"", whatever that is, is used. A mystery to me. I wonder if the blu-ray version actually has the extended cut on it?"
5,Rod Serling loves this film in heaven,"Back in 1979 ""Alien"" blew the hinges off Lucas' and Speilberg's fantasy of a (child-like) take on alien encounters.This film was and is-- an (in-your-face) horror 'grand guignol' descent into alien paranoia that modern cinema has yet to recover from-- (no matter how many remakes they make of it, hollywood will never top this art-house sci/fi/horror epic)--Ridley Scott's best film...period"
4,One of the first films that scarred me,The first time I saw Alien it kinda freaked me out. I remeber clunging to my mom as a six year old boy during the chest busting scene. I saw the film on Cinemax about two years ago and the chest busting scene got me again. I love this movie.
5,One of the Best,"Alien is a beautiful film and is the greatest sci-fi/horror film ever. All of the sets used are magnificent, from the interior and exterior of the Nostromo to the very organic alien setting. The different stages of the alien are done perfectly and are surprisingly realistic and very believable. The creature itself is extremely original and hasn't aged with time.The film works kind of slow (in a good way) and manages to build a lot tension. They really gave it a feeling of emptiness that complements the space element. All of the actors are perfect and to this day it has one of the most shocking scenes in movie history.This is one of my favorite movies and is a must own for fans of all genres."
4,"Scary, Stunning, and horrifying in the 70s....Now not so much 3.5 stars","I am not of the generation that saw this in 79' so maybe thats why it didn't affect me as much. It just wasn't very scary. The scene where the alien pops out of the guys stomach and when Ripley was alone on the escape pod were great, but I was expecting more still shots. Instead it was edited quickly and rapidly and was hard to see what was happening in some shots.The Aliens do look impressive. The Alien should have been Jabba, in Star Wars. The Alien clinging to the guy's face in the begining looked real, it was awesome. The sets also were impressive, the ship looked great too.Overall it just didn't affect me as much as I thought it would. I mean if Alien came out today without the language it would be PG-13. It was horrifying in the 70s, but for me, it had some great sets, and scenes and some great effects for when it was made, but it still was missing something.....3.5 stars."
5,good movie,a surpringley good film good alien weaver is exelent a true oscar roll. scary fun see itits atrue classic love you weaver.
4,Alien life force gets almost all humans. (ALF),"Should we go down to the planet? Should we let the infected crew member back into the space shuttle? Should we expect mayhem? Of course!! this is Alien, the creature who was allowed entry by our Science Officer. But wait, they telegragh every monster scene, but who cares.An excellent movie with great special effects (1979). Still stands up with today's Sci-Fi.Not 4 stars, but actually 4 1/2 *Uncle Lar END"
5,Maybe the best movie of all times,"Alien has been my favourite movie since I saw it for the first time, as a teenager. Since then, I have seen it about eighty times, and I still enjoy it just as much.Not only is it a perfect thriller, with that extra claustrophic feeling about it. It also has a unique charm of ""old-fashioned futuristic technology"" - the interior of the spaceship, the computers, the entire atmosphere. The movie is from 1979, and science fiction is just so much better when it's made in a time where far from everyone had ever seen a computer!This is the best of thrillers, the best of movies. And it never steps beyond its own frame, it just never exaggerates.No wonder, Alien is considered as a classic in film history!"
4,"Next time you go out into space, mind your own business!","A great combination of science fiction and horror. Ridley Scott got a lot of mileage out of the smallest cast for a major motion picture since Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"". If you can stomach the ""hatching"" of the alien monster out of John Hurt's chest and manage to stay in your seat afterwards, you'll find that this really is one of the better films in the category of sci-fi."
5,This is a SCI-FI classic in many ways.,"Aside from the chase scene that takes up the last half of the movie, ""ALIEN"" is one of the most original conceptualizations within the SCI-FI genre that I've seen. The first time I saw it, I was left stunned (which seems melodramatic, I know) but I avoided this film for years after that. It's funny to me that I experienced real dread over this movie. For that I applaud the people who created its atmosphere, characterizations, set design, art direction, etc. Nothing like a parasite bursting out your guts to teach you benefits of a high fiber diet!!"
4,Truly one of the most scary movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!,"(My review is based on the theatrical version only)Alien is a scary,heart-pounding,and unforgetable movie that has became a classic for it's chilling scenes with the alien and the movie's memorable performances(including Tom Skeritt,Ian Holm and of course,Sigourney Weaver in her star making role as Ellen Ripley).Overall,I truly recommend this film and the first and third sequel(and maybe the third film)"
4,True Horror Movie,"The original Alien is the first and probably the best of the series. Alien may have a slower pace than the action packed Aliens, it had more tension and suspense which is more important in a horror movie. The suspense in Alien is more unnerving than the Alien it self. In Alien, the alien was invicible, no one could kill it. The aliens in Aliens were fairly easy to kill which made for stuning action sequences, but adversely made them less frightening.Don't get me wrong Aliens is a great Action Thriller movie and it is the perfect sequel to Alien, Aliens is an Action Thriller movie while Alien is a true horror movie."
2,ms. weaver,Sigourney Weaver's terrific performance and the amzing special effects save this movie from getting 1 star.
3,In space no can hear you scream,"Perhaps one of the most notorious taglines in film history, Alien already looked set to be a box office smash. The audience of the 70's at the time were shocked and captivated by this completely new plot never explored by filmmakers in previous decades. Alien had taken horror/sci-fi to a new level. On a ship exploring new life, the crew are terrorised by a deadly breed of Alien, it's only intention to kill. It is up to Ripley, possibly one of the most memorable female heroines, and her team to defeat the deadly species before it reaches home. A classic that will never be forgotten with such an eerie element of atmosphere. This film, however, deserves no more than 3 stars. While I can appreciate the ratings and great reviews Alien received, it is very difficult for newer generations to find it truly shocking. Action is slightly lacking in this movie."
2,No Quality Control,"I looked forward to viewing this product with much anticipation, in part because it was supposed to have an alternate dolby soundtrack in Spanish. I was disappointed to find at the root menu that the soundtrack was, in fact, mono and the quality was somewhat murky. Also, the Spanish version would suddenly switch to English without notice and could not be rectified. The faulty sections could not be made to follow the selected soundtrack even by going back to the root menu. This product tries to include too many features--both the original and re-edited versions of the movie, plus other material on a second disk. That is probably why there was such poor quality control and the product is not as advertised. A single, high quality version of the movie would be preferable."
2,See the sequel.,"This is one of those rare cases where the sequel (ONLY the first, mind you) is better than the original. Alien is, to me, dull, dark, shock-horror, trying to scare you with sudden noises and camera turns. I sat there waiting for something to happen for most of the film, mostly bored to tears. To me, the only purpose for Alien is as a set up for the far superior Aliens."
4,Revisiting a classic,"I had just seen the new ""Prometheus"" in the theater and wanted to review the original. This movie is, of course, a classic and never lets the viewer down. I rented this from Amazon's streaming service and was very happy with the picture quality on my HDTV via my PS3."
5,Great movie,"Alien is, quite honestly, one of my favorite movies. I really like the atmosphere, it's suspensful and moody. And of course Ripley is one of the most iconic movie characters ever. Alien is one of the best sci-fi/horror movies ever. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,"This is still a good movie, but dated","The movie is still a classic, but dated. I was wondering the whole movie why they didn't turn some damn lights on since they were hunting for a crazy homicidal alien. Oh also, the audio was slightly out of sync like most Amazon videos I stream from my ps3 to my TV."
2,A great read,All of his books are real page turners and this one is no exception. I have now read every book he has written and they have all held my attention....sometimes into the the wee morning hours!!! I highly recommend him to anyone who enjoys a good mystery or who-done-it that keeps you guessing to the last page.
4,Dull Glances,"In this film, dont wait too horror.Because it s not as horror as the first one.But there s afew scenes which is really to bounce. Cast's r good but a few scenes they couldnt show good performance.But i cant say same thing for Jonathan Scott Taylor. Really he has used his eyes very frightening and dull.And showed very good performance.On the other hand film's music's r to effecting the human.But in this film, the most important thing is scenario.The scenario is so fascinating.Shortly this film is a completely OMEN."
2,"It is nothing like the book, and first of all...","...far from being the movie ""The Omen"" was and is. And I am shocked to see that it is rated just as high by the reviewers here on Amazon as the original. Not that I have anything against this sequel, but it should just not be compared to the masterpiece the 1'st movie was. Better actors in this one? Not a chanse, but they're ok. The movie is ok, and faithful to the book -but the problem is that the book is so pshycological -and hard to put to life on screen. I think the producers and director with their cast did a good try, but the ""return of The Omen"" is not what it could have been. And this considering it has a lot to live up to!"
4,Creepy and Engaging,"This movie is very memorable. Sure, its not as good as the first one but it is good in its own way. The boot camp setup was intriguing. The deaths were pretty cool, the birds and ice thing. Overall its worthwhile."
4,DAMIEN RULES,THIS WAS A VERY GOOD SEQUEL. IT TAKES PLACE A WEEK AFTER THE FIRST ONE ENDED. POPINAGEN THE GUY ON THE FIRST ONE FINDS OUT DAMIEN IS STILL ALIVE. HE GOES INTO A CAVE WHERE YOU SEE DAMIENS FACE PAINTED ON THE WALL WITH SNAKES IN HIS HAIR. THEN THE PLACE COLLAPSES AND HE GETS KILLED. THEN IT IS SEVEN YEARS LATER DAMIEN IS 12 YEARS OLD LIVING WITH IS STEP UNCLE AND AUNT. HE GOES TO A BOOT CAMP THATS WHERE HE FINDS OUT WHO HE IS. HE DENIES IT AT FIRST. BUT THEN HE STARTS TO KILL PEOPLE EVEN HIS OWN COUSIN WHO WAS LIKE A BROTHER TO HIM. THE FILM HAS A GREAT TWIST TO IT AT THE VERY VERY END THE I DID NOT EXPECT AT ALL.STILL THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER.
5,Far superior to the first!,"Damien Thorn, a completely gratifying character, as scott-thomas, with such intensity in lines such as ""He has risen Mark, IN ME!"" The kid sends a shiver down your spine. The ending of the movie, was the most exhilerating I have seen, just the feeling you get when he walks out of the museum, and the face he makes, I swear that kid must have been the anti-christ, there is no way some one that age can be that convincing. (or any age for that matter)"
5,"Damien, The Be All End All Of The Omen Trillogy","Without a doubt, Damien The Omen 2 is the best of the series. Great casting, fine cinnamatography and a spine chilling score give life or should I say death to this movie. A must see for every horror movie fan."
3,Ridiculous mess but fun nonetheless,"Oh, it's got the usual gruesome deaths, and the music that signals when something terrible is about to happen. But the main attraction (or distraction, depending on your outlook) is the bad acting. Lee Grant is awful! Her reactions to the dreadful things that happen are ridiculous. It makes her performance in ""Valley of the Dolls"" look good. William Holden looks like he'd rather be anywhere else but doing this picture. Nobody really fares well in this. It is definitely a guilty pleasure, as one of the other reviewers noted. I like it, but it is without a doubt a BAD movie. But then again, some of my favorite movies are the rotten ones, like, come to think of it, ""Valley of the Dolls""."
3,He's back!,"Damien is living with his uncle's family and as he reaches puberty, the son of Satan learns the truth about himself. Yet he is still protected by the demonic forces of evil. Those who learn who the boy truely is, die in freak accidents.Not as good as the original, but still pretty decent for a sequel. If you liked the first movie and want to see the continuing story of Damien Thorn, then you should see this movie."
3,OMEN 2 IS A PASSABLE FOLLOW-UP TO THE ORIGINAL,THE OMEN 2 is almost as good as THE OMEN except my only complaint is that DAMIEN does'nt seem to realize that he is the son of the devil he spends way too much time in this film trying to figure it out. I mean SCOTT-TAYLOR does a good job in the title role but the suspense doesn't quite build up to the original throughout the film. There's a RAVEN in this film too and I thought it was out of place as DAMIEN'S protector. The people who begin to suspect DAMIEN'S purpose in life do they or do they not have accidents? I won't say just watch and find out my advice if you liked THE OMEN you'll like DAMIEN OMEN 2 but probably not as much.
2,a-okay,"Own the 1st own. Unless you are a die-hard Omen fan, I would skip on this, not worth the $$$ to own since this movie kinda [stunk] and the transfer isn't all that great."
5,Great movie in great shape,"Hello My son had been dying to see this movie and was thrilled to find it new, he was so happy to see the sequel. Thanks"
4,FOR A SEQUEL...,FOR A SEQUEL IT IS VERY GOOD. NOT AS SCARY AS THE ORINGINAL. BUT SCARY NONETHELESS. PICKS UP WHERE THE FIRST ONE LEAVES OFF.
5,Maltin Type Review,"Terrific sequel to terrific original, this one has devil child Damien (Jonathan Scott Taylor) 12 an living with his aunt and uncle (Lee Grant and William Holden), but when he discovers his true self, he becomes mad and many strange and creative deaths follow. Genuily creepy, yet not to gory, this sequel ranks high among sequels, giving us realistic and believable characters who we can feel love and sympathy for and a truly gret choice for the role of Damien (Scott-Taylor is outstanding!) Highly recommended! Next up: The Final Conflict.**** out of ****"
4,very uplifting song,the Gospel side of Michael Jackson is very underrated to me overall. His vocal performance here is very strong. the musical arrangements and Production compliment the feel and vibe where MJ was reaching for and going for. very uplifting message song and the harmonys are on point as well.
3,Too much EMD - other manufacturers mostly ignored,"Photography is good, but narrative is not exhaustive. Coverage becomes redundant. Too much EMD - other manufacturers mostly ignored. The cover gives a clue."
4,Long Shot for Paul,"Matt Christopher's Long Shot for Paul is an awesome and encouraging book. Glenn , a normal young boy, teaches his brother Paul how to play basketball. The main problem was that Paul was mentally handicapped. Basketball came slow to Paul.My opinion of this book is that it is exciting and encouraging. Its exciting because you always want to know whats going to happen next. Its encouraging to know that Glenn is helping his brother get through the season. At first the coach won't let him play because they don't have enough jerseys. But when he gets his jersey he acts like the happiest kid on earth.I'd recommend this book to you if you like basketball. But don't just read this one there area lot of other sports books with football, baseball, motorcross, tennis and more. The reason I like sports books is because they give me ideas on what to do during a game, and they're just good to read."
3,Paul's Problems,"This book is a good book. It's about a boy named Glenn and his brother Paul, who is mentally challenged. Glenn helps Paul in basketball so he can make friends. But some people still won't accept him. This is a good book, and I would recommend it to any kid. It teaches you not to judge people just because they are different before you get to know them."
4,This book is very good for children,"Long Shot for Paul is a very good book. I don't usually like sports books but this one I did. It's by a well know author, Matt Christopher. It's about two brothers Tlenn and Paul. Glenn, the oldest, teaches Paul to play basketball. There's a problem; Paul has a learning problem and is slow. Paul is on a team but does not play a lot. The coach is mean and treats him badly because of his problem. Most of the story is exciting, but some parts are unrealistic. Like there family sits by the fire and sings Christmas songs. Also Glenn and his brother never fight. Matt Christopher has other good books but this one was my favorite. As you can see Long Shot for Paul is a very good book."
2,Close but No Cigar,"This band is allright, at best. The lyrics are pretty good and they are talented with their instruments and all, but it gets old too quick. Mainly because the singer is too monotone. And they sound NOTHING like Millencolin, so I wouldn't buy this album basing it off of that. They actually sound a lot like Pulley. And this is true for both bands: if you've heard one song by them, you've heard 'em all. Sure that one song's pretty good, but it's no fun when they all sound the same. If you want one good song from this album check out ""Weight of The World."""
3,A crankfest,"This album is just OK, I don't really understand all the rave reviews. The song writing is amateurish and boring, and the only thing that makes up for that is the talented musicianship. The drumming is fast but sounds like a cliche. This band reminds me of a fast Pennywise.This band is actually typical of a lot of things I've heard from Theologian Records, just a guitar bass and drums crankfest, with some might-as-well-be-anonymous dude yelping on top of it all. I've listened to it several times and nothing really grabs me, I actually find it hard to pay attention to.If you're looking to expand your collection of same-sounding melodic hardcoreish cliche punk music, then perhaps this is a good choice. It will prevent you from having to listen to Pennywise over and over again I suppose... and at least the musical talent is there and the mix is good. But this is nothing special, take it from me."
4,Children love to praise the Lord,I began assisting with my church's children's choir one month ago and the children love singing the songs from this album.They practice often and when asked to sing any of these songs they sing to the honor and glory of God. I like the songs myself. They are a great inspiration.
1,I did not like the metal cycle on it,"When I look it the Lily of France Value In style microfiber seamless lightly lined underwire with soft stretch pad, best beige 34A , I found it has a metal cycle. I did not like it at once. Only the metal cycle on it, I feel it is too cool for a woman. I like a plastic cycle on it. It is better than a metal one."
3,Nice Idea - Not so nice execution,"Really like the Pop-a-bowl, pop-a-plate etc so thought I would try this out. It's a waste of money and space! While the idea of having a removable paper towel dispenser sounds nice, the SUPER BIG sides that look like a flower actually take up more space than a regular cheapo paper towel holder that installs under the cabinet.Save your money and buy a regular inexpensive plastic holder...not only will it cost less but it requires less space than this ""cutsey"" model. Still, this does work so three stars."
4,Knife block,I love my new knife block. It allows me easy access to the knife of my choice during my culinary activities.
5,Crazy World,"This virtuoso piece is what we like to call avante garde. Most of us have never seen choreography like this, it's extremely demanding of the dancers abilities, non romantic in the extreme yet offers many dazzling male female duets. It's tempting to compare this work with Twyla Tharp's The Catherine Wheel. I think this piece is a little more coherent and none of the dancers are wasted. The vacuum cleaner dance is both funny, angry and celebratory. We have an amazing group of dancers here and they definitely earn the wild applause at the end. The original music is great too."
1,Only for Modern Ballet afficianado's,"Summary: Avoid this ballet if you are a lover of classical ballet and hate modern balletI like my dance to be flowing, uplifting, and as celebratory of human form and movement whatever kind of dance it maybe. The music accompanying this should be at least melodic and with a theme even if simple. On both these counts the ballet fails. The movements are random, disjointed, with no apparent integration or theme. I quickly got bored. Note that these are the same POB dancers and company that I adore. However this choreography is wretched. Obviously I am unable to appreciate elements of beauty in such modern ballets. Nevertheless I lost money since none of the reviews before me made the above clear and so I went ahead and bought this waste of a DVD. Be sure you like abrupt choppy incoherent themeless uncelebratory mundane modern dance before you buy this DVD."
5,Buy this!,"i am totally impressed by this new Bobby Conn record. it is one of those rare records that only rewards you more and more the more and more you listen to it. in terms of scope/breadth, it can certainly be compared to 1998's Rise Up, and in fact, i think it is better. (Rise Up may be more shockingly impressive when you first hear the guy, but i think that the new one is actually better in that it improves on what he does. Which is no mean feat.) this is by far my best record purchase in i-dont-know-how-long."
3,River Of No Return,I have long waited for this movie to be availible in my country but was never released on DVD here. Thanks to Amazon I finally have a copy and it was worth the wait great scenery and adventure and of course to see Marilyn Monroe in a different role.
4,Good Movie,"I remember seeing this movie as a kid and I always loved the music in the movie. When I saw that Amazon sold the dvd, I had to have it. I still like the movie and the music."
4,"If you like Marilyn, you will love this...","River of No Return was a really good movie.. Marilyn plays a soft, yet smarter role than some of her other movies."
3,Marilyn in a Serious Role,"This is a well-done action/adventure film. The river sequences are excellent, and Monroe is surprisingly effective in this dramatic role."
5,River of no Return,"Mitchum and Monroe create electricity on the silver screen.A nicely written story about the old west,a saloon entertainerand the virile Mitchum. The river scenes are well filmedconsidering it was the 1950's. No state of the artcameras like today. I ordered the DVD and my MM collectionkeeps growing.I recommend it as an enjoyable drama with Indians,bad guysand above all else,a sultry,seductive Marilyn."
4,Happy,"Disc came to me in mail fast, and good picture quality but fluctuating sound quality. But it's an OLD movie so I was still happy."
3,Picture Quality,"I was a kid when I saw this movie. The DVD is a bit of a disappointment, the picture quality is not very good. I read the other reviews and they all seem to have a good copy, but mine is not. I have an HD TV. I still enjoyed MM and the songs she sings. I hope they will make a Blue Ray disc of this movie soon."
3,I'm gonna file my claim on Marilyn!,"Marilyn is so beautiful in this movie. While the movie itself is not her best, she is just so amazingly gorgeous in it. Like the scenery itself. The story isn't very good, but to see Marilyn perform ""One Silver Dollar"" ""I'm gonna file my claim"" and ""river of no return"" and a sweet ""down in the meadow"" it's worth buying! she does act decently in this but it's hardly her top acting. The little boy is very good too."
4,very good role for Marilyn,"This is a story about a man & his boy who find a woman who has been abanded by her lover. In order to get everyone safely out of Indian Counrty, the man, boy and the girl must travel down a river to the town.Robert Mitchum plays the good guy and Marilyn Monroe plays the woman."
3,Beautiful country,"The scenery in this film is magnificent, for those who love the outdoors. The acting is mediocre at best. Mitchum acts more like a robot being controlled by someone off-screen. Monroe is not at her best and at times appears bored with the part. An OK movie if you have nothing else to watch."
4,wild river,"This is the first Marilyn Monroe movie I saw in which she played a sophisticated character - a salon singer who gave her every penny for her untrustworthy boyfriend to file claim on a potential goldmine. And she played it well and sang beautifully.The fact that the movie was shot in the picturesque Canada certainly helped. The roaring river and the rocky cliffs did not pale even when compared with River Wild (Meryl Streep) made decades later. Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe were a perfect couple. Two lonely souls in the west who deserved a better life.For the superb cineamatography, the theme song (sang by Monroe during the movie and again at the end in a western cowboy style) and the leading characters, this is a movie to see."
5,Return to the River,"I cannot emphasize enough how nicely this movie appeared in Blu-ray! Wonderful colors, beautiful resolution, and fantastic DTS surround sound for the songs, the bar scenes, and the river rafting. So much an improvement over the standard DVD! Not to be missed. (I had the same response to seeing ""The African Queen"" in Blu-ray - I guess you take one-part Blu-ray, add water, and stir!"
1,River of no Return,"DVD was working only about fist 20 minutes and then no picture, only sound.I oredered may DVD from you and this is the first time happend I would like t send me naother one. Returnign the item will cost money. Please let me konw what your service departemnt to decide to do by e-mailBernard Lee"
2,"I Agree with Marilyn; a ""Z-List Western"" it Is.","Corny camp westerns don't come much worse than this, and it truly delivers if that's what you're looking for. Well, I never much cared for Robert Mitchum, who reminds me of a slimey lizard anyway, and the dialog is over-the-top silly. The plot is cookie cutter typical 50s western faire, only other movies in the genre are better done. Atrocious fake Indians that are an amalgamation of every stereotype you've ever seen in those old pictures so that you don't even know what tribe they actually represent, and an absence of passionate direction on Otto Preminger's part make this oldie a bonafide dud. On the bright side, Marilyn is breathtakingly beautiful despite the troubles surrounding the shoot, and the musical numbers she performs are indeed charming. They're the only reason to sit through this poorly conceived western. Give me Some Like it Hot any day instead!"
2,not one of her best movies,This was not one of Marilyn's best drama roles. Loved her in Don't Knock and Niagra but this wasn't as good.
4,Readable and educational,"I love to read history - especially biographies, and more especially about French history. I found Bergin's book very readable, containing interesting incites into the age, not only economically but also giving me legal facts I had not known before. The main obstacle in the book is that the author assumes that his reader can read 17th century French! I read French, but sometimes the old spellings make it difficult for me to understand. If he had translated the passages in his footnotes, it would have given me a choice - decipher it myself, or read the footnote. This would have improved the book with little effort"
1,Replay TV ...,"I bought this unit in mid-December. It MUST be networked to your coputer and internet. It would NOT recognize a Windows ME network, and SonicBlue admitted that this was a major problem. I sent it back Fed EX, and it is now April, and I have not received my money back. I would be very cautious about buying anything from a company with this history."
5,Suprising !,Very well made ! Salman was at his best - the plot twist was fabulous. Love the acting and the music - Dance scenes were incredible - Salman was pushed and he overachieved his dancing was spectacular.
1,You missed the prayers meaning,"I am curious that Pastor Hopkins missed the meaning of the prayer of jabez. I am also shocked that he is calling a scripture in the bible ""the cult of jabez"". As Pastor Hopkins should know GOD knows what his children's needs are. (As a christian I place all my needs in GOD's hands but I also work for a living.} What Pastor Hopkins should be happy is that people are actually reading the bible, even if only to read the about the prayer of jabez, in a time when the bible is the last book people want to read. You should be encouraging folks to read more of the bible, Pastor Hopkins. And please read the prayer of jabez."
1,Doesn't get it,"Obviously, the Prayer of Jabez is not understood by people who agree with this book. The Prayer of Jabez does have you pray for blessing, but why do people always assume that this means money and things!!? A prayer for blessing may be peace in your life, a different outlook, an ability to help others, and to give a word of encouragement to those who need it. Those who haven't read and really grasped the Prayer of Jabez may want to give it a read with these things in mind. It is a mindset that there are always opportunities to minister to others if we are open to them and willing to let God work through us. That is the essential message of the Prayer of Jabez which this book denegrates so."
1,"Another Faulty Reading of ""The Prayer of Jabez""","This isn't the first time ""The Prayer of Jabez"" has been attacked. I did not read ""The Prayer of Jabez"" and then come away expecting to get rich or to have it easy as a Christian. In fact, I was challenged to simply be open for God to use me in whatever capacity He chooses, whether it be through wealth or through poverty, through health or sickness, through goodtimes or bad. ""The Prayer of Jabez"" challenged me to never be satisfied with where I am in Christ. It challenged me to always be ready to move out of my comfort zone and be ready for God to use me. Pastor Hopkins is reacting to some in the church who are mistaken in their understanding of Bruce Wilkinson's book. Perhaps Pastor Hopkins misunderstands Wilkinson's book himself."
1,I feel sorry for this man!,I have been so blessed by the Prayer of Jabez. This book has reached out to even so many non-christians. It is a shame that this man who has written this new book calls himself a minister. He forgets for the greed of money that the prayer of Jabez was a prayer that God answered in the Bible. This man's teaching is heretic. All Christians beware. Please don't buy this book. He is out to make money. Let him come out to share with us all how much he is making with this book. He knows how this book has been so popular do he has written this to get cheap publicity so that his book will sell.
4,Bed Lamps,This lamp looks good and works well. The only problem is the extension cord - permanently attached - is black which is terrible unless you have black walls. I had to buy wire covers to pretty them up.The price was good but a little high.
5,Truely amazing,This CD is by far one of the best chillout cds ever released. Dj Ravin (cd1) has found a way to bring together all these cultures in a way that even Claude Challes could not. I only gave it 5 stars because the system won't take more.
3,bhudda bar presents amnesty international ~ various artists,"The first part of the cd is not too bad, but the second part of the cd is horrible. The mix of the music does not carry the bhudda bar signature. Too much rage music and it's not as spiritual as the others."
5,Mcy D's,"The Series of Unfortunate Events is a great series. I am on the eighth book. The name of the book is called The Hostile Hospital. In the story the kids are accused of killing a man whose name is Jacques Snicket. The escaped being captured twice in the first half of the story. This is a really great story, I suggest you read it."
1,Major let down.,"I bought these books (actually the first three box sets) on the recommendation of a friend. But I messed up, this was not what she said. I muddled through each of the 9 books because I will not give up and feel it would be a waste of my money to throw them away. But truly, I would have rather spent my time getting a root canal, or being anally probed by aliens. These books are horrible! He warns you, but you figure it's in jest and there will be a point, or an upside to them. There's not. The movie however, is entertaining. Go figure. Check them out from the library if you're really that curious, but don't waste your money."
4,An excellent guide to a healthier life.,"This is scientifically-based and is a ""must read"" for the health conscious individiual. I give this book a ""thumbs up!"""
2,Ignores detoxification and other things,"I thought this book had some useful information when I first read it several years ago. After I read it, I stopped taking selenium supplements and decreased my daily dosage of vitamin C to 2,000 mg. Then I got a tumor in my neck (spring 2000), and most recently a breast tumor. I read that selenium actually inhbits the growth of tumors, so I am upset for having followed Roizen's advice. Also, I learned that one can take up to 10 GRAMS of vitamin C per day with very beneficial results. This vitamin also helps prevent and fight cancer. Finally, Roizen completely omits any mention of the need for regular detoxification. He says it's okay to drink tap water! I have lost my respect for this author and am now selling his book. It's out of date."
2,Just Go To the web site,"I was pretty excited about the book, but it doesn't tell much you don't get from doing the quiz on the web site, realage.com. Save your money..."
3,Caution about Mega Dosing on Vitamins,"I found many interesting things in this book that is written for the masses. However, like exercising, everyone needs to decide or get a professionals opinion about what is good for them as an individual. I had followed the recommendations of the book for the last 9 months to a tee besides going to the website to get my ""Realage"" down. I just experienced a kidney stone that needed to be removed. For anyone that has been through a stone ordeal knows that it is equal in pain to childbirth or more so according to my urologist. A leading contributor of my stone was the increased intake of calcium, vitamin D, and Vitamin C that I took based on the recommendations of this book. Were there other factors? Probably. However, what is good for one person may not be good for all. So proceed with caution. Again, the book did enlighten me in many areas."
4,A must-read health book.,"With the unfolding development of the internet and its related technologies (still quite crude really), mankind is about to make another giant leap forward thereby making life infinitely more interesting and exciting. So I assume people will somehow like to prolong their stay here on earth. From a broad perspective, this book explains the dynamics of what accelerates or decelerates our aging process. Good health to all!!!"
2,Nothing new,A friend of mine said that she found this book on line and wondered if I would read it with her. After reading the book we both decided that there was no new information in this book at all. All though there are some good points to the book I feel It's just old news with a new gloss over it. I was not very impressed at all.
3,This book helps to motivate a health lifestyle,This book makes a lot of good lifestyle reccomendations but overlaps in adding years. The author admits that you cannot add total years from the analysis but that does make it confusing. I am very disapointed that I cannot find the real age quiz on-line.
1,Nothing new,"The author is an anesthesiologist who has not cited any scientifically reasonable research of his own in the area he professes to be an expert in. His suggestions are absolutely nothing new... just the same old public health findings (don't smoke, wear your seat belt etc)told in yet another one of the 1000 ways we have seen come on the market. Boring. Given the tactics of this whole anti-aging industry I would not at all be surprised if most of the reviews here have been fabricated by the author and his friends."
2,No Big Deal,"I purchased this for my WRT54GC wireless router, and honestly I saw no ""significant"" gain. I think these devices are tested in wide open areas, and this doesn't really simulate how it will behave inside of a house. Don't exactly know what to recommend. Maybe one of those professional expensive boosting devices, but this is really not worth it."
1,Katana Shell,"I was a bit disappointed in this product. Wasn't what I expected. I won't be using it. However, putting that aside, it does fit my Katana phone and was a pretty shade of soft pink."
2,6-star story with 1-star printing and binding,"Everyone likes the story! However, the printing and binding of this edition is really horrible - cheap paper, small fond of printing, very bad binding. The ink of most of the pages is very light and fuzzy, and the words are just like photo copies from a very old photo copy machine. I bought one copy of ""Monkey, A journey to the West, retold by David Kherdian, 208 pages"" and ten copies of this book (Monkey, Folk Novel of China, translated by Arthur Waley, 306 pages), planning to pass to my friends' kids for gifts, the former (208-page one) has much better printing and binding and is good for gifts. But this book (the 306-page one) absolutely cannot be used as gifts since it looks way too cheap like those from one-dollar store, and printing/fond is absolutely not appropriate for young readers to protect their eyes."
2,Not van Gulik's China,"I only rate Monkey 1 star because I could not get into it. So my review is only based on trying to read a few pages. I suppose I was hoping for something like the Judge Dee stories by Robert van Gulik, which have their own lovely, simple style. Maybe someday I can get over the energy barrier and give it another try. But if you're a Judge Dee fan, don't be sure you can get yourself into this story."
5,Vocal pop trance perfection---a la Ian Van Dahl and Lasgo,"Milk Inc finally gets a full US release thanks to Water Music Dance, and it's an awesome 77 minutes of music!!! Includes the full length remixes, 6-8 minutes long, of Sun Always Shines and Time. But bonus tracks aside, this is by far one of the STRONGEST CD's worth of Power Pop female vocal trance I've ever added to my collection. There are 2 obligatory ballads (one an awful duet), and one track that is a breakbeat trance instrumental, but that leaves 12 tracks of slammin vocals and riffs, as well as the amazing remixes!!! Truly outstanding. Nearly every track on this disc is going into the trance folder on my ipod."
2,Could be a lot better - very out of date,"This dictionary seems handy enough until you actually try to use it. Turkish is a constantly changing language and the creators of this dictionary don't seem to have a grasp of true Turkish. After using the dictionary I am very often I corrected by native Turks who say ""Where did that come from; that's totally wrong.""And, as I become more fluent myself, I see the vast number of discrepancies contained both in this book and the larger Turkish one by Langensheidt."
4,Flawed yet indispensable,"I can't complain too much because there aren't that many Turkish-English dictionaries out there, but this one has some small issues.First, I've found two typos so far. They were minor (""to rob oneself"" instead of ""to rub oneself"") but I suspect there may be more.Second, there are discrepancies between the English section and the Turkish section. For example, I hear a Turkish word and look it up. It's not in the Turkish section, but I guess the meaning, look it up in English and it's there.Having said that, what I like about the dictionary is that it includes many forms of verbs (the passive, reflexive, causative, etc) which make my time in Turkish class a lot easier.A warning: Turkish changes quite a bit. With this dictionary (or any dictionary) one probably wouldn't be able to tell if a word is old or new, or which is more acceptable to use in speech. Be prepared for people to correct you.All things considered, I carry mine everywhere I go."
3,Useful,This dictionary is very useful for beginers that are learning turkish. You can take it in your pocket to the classroom doesn't ocupy a lot of space. Useful for beginers but if you want to continuing to improove you should buy a bigger dictionary with more words. To begin is good. Very precise and easy to look for words. Good price also.
3,Kinda feel a bit cheated,I honestly think it would have been in better condition and cheaper if I had purchased it new. It is a little haggered on the outside. However it is a perfect travel size and I look forward to referencing it upon my travels all over Turkey. Service was very prompt.
5,I love this movie,"I saw this movie years ago on public television and loved it. Today, it is especially fun to watch the glimpse of 1954 London and to remember how much fun life can be!"
3,Bad transfer on this Portuguese Import,"Bad transfer on this Portuguese Import. Grainy. Might be from a well-used VHS tape. The sound has some flutter and quite a bit of clipping in the musical passages. Too bad, ""Genevieve"" is a very funny movie. I remember it from when it came out in 1953.On the flip side of this DVD is a truly horrible movie called ""Carry on up the Khyber"". T&A; and smutty jokes. Manages to portray almost everyone offensively (Brits, Indians, Afghans). (Same bad transfer as ""Genevieve"".)"
4,A TWIST ON A TRADITIONAL TALE,"Everyone loves a classic Cinderella story, and this traditional tale is made even more enticing by the gracefully provocative illustrations of South African artist Jude Daly. Her pages fairly sing with color and movement. In this Irish version the very beautiful Trembling lives in a castle high in Ireland's hills with her two sisters Fair and Brown. Trembling is rescued from her drudgery by henwife who gives her a lovely white gown and shamrock-green shoes, then sends her off to church on a milk-white mare. Of course, she meets the Prince of Emania. You'll never guess how many children they have or the fate of Fair and Brown. It's all in this charming twist on a well-loved story."
2,bitter sweet electronic lemon,"Yes, it works with XP and true to its USB 2.0 heritage it is fast too, however...It's big and bulky so its only reasonable to keep it like lose change in your pocket, but then, by 30 days it will have cracked it in two.Oh yes, the design is really slick but the cover does not reattach once removed, so put that in the bin since you are going to lose it anyhow.And on a cold winters night what better thing to keep you warm than a SONY micro vault, yes sir, this device is gona get hot and suck the life from your laptop battery.Not designed for keyrings (not that any other flash drive is either)."
1,DO NOT BUY THE MICRO VAULT PRODUCT!,THIS IS A HORRIBLE DEVICE. IT IS NOT USB 2.0 COMPLIANT. IT IS VERY VERY SLOW. I TRIED EVERYTHING!
3,A better one!,"i read this book, it was awesome but when i read this bookSorority Girl Talk - Erotic Sex Stories - Volume 1, i get a totally different test with cheap rate. Please check this out. Really this book is awesome with new style of writing :)"
1,"Nice design, poor quality","I was really excited to try out the Califone Headphones on my daughter while on a 10 hour flight. They worked well at first, but then the right headphone quit working almost immediately. The design is great and fit our daughter well, but I'm disappointed in the quality of this item. These are made for kids and should be relatively durable. I would not recommend this product."
3,Pretty good headphones for small children,"I bought these for my 2-year-old for his cassette player. I was hoping they'd have a maximum volume, but I still have to test the volume and set it on the cassette player myself (and hope he doesn't increase it). They are a great size for young kids and seem to be very comfortable."
3,Headphones,These are great for volume control but after a few weeks use are starting to come apart. They also are a little bigger than hoped for and are a little too big for our 3 yr olds head.
2,Not really,Lasted 2 weeks. Then broke. Ok while they lasted. Size worked great for 2 year old. Small for my 9 year old
5,Comfortable and sturdy,My kids wear these all the time and like them alot. They're a good quality and have stood up to abuse. I have a pair for each of my sons.
4,Good headphones,"These are good they are not great, only because after seven months of owning them my daughter tugged on the headphones and the thin cord ripped off the headphones. I got them for a good price so I cant complain. I would buy them again I just wish they were a little bit sturdier. They fit my seven year old very well."
3,huh,i like the make up but the hair is way to white is she going for the gwyn stefanie look or something? i thought she had blond hair not white. only delancey can pull that off because she has highlights but over all she is a nice doll. i would getter if i liked barbie. but i like delancey better sorry to all the barbie fans but in my OPINION i like delancey better
1,"I am a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge my scene fan,but................","I love my scene,but not this one.Her clothes are realy ugly and her face.This is not the real Barbie in the my scene gang I know.Get another my scene Barbie doll insted.I must get Barbie Day and nite."
1,Barbie My Scene - Dressed to Impress Holiday Doll,"One word to describe this doll- Ugly! Very fat lips and a scowl on her face! She is a discrace to mattel dolls, such as REAL Barbies!!! I love dolls, even though i am 12, but i mostly hate my scene! (Well, except for My Scene shopping spree Chelsea AND Barbie which i LOVE!)"
1,ugly copicat,"i do not like this doll. she is ugly. she is a copy of the bratz holiday dolls. especially cloe i mean cloe had red dress babrbie has red dress, cloe has blonde hair, barbie has blonde hair or should i say white. ahahaha she is so ugly. anyway here is proof that my scene copied bratz. on [...] if u type in myscene it will come up""MyScene is a line of Barbie dolls, meant to be more modern and trendy than normal. They were created by Mattel to combat the direct and growing threat of Bratz dolls.""""the threat of bratz dolls"" that means they were copies of bratzso haha bratz win"
4,My Scene Dolls for My Girls,"Another cute doll in the My Scene Collection. This is a nice doll with the ball gown, which is not easily found for these dolls. My girls love playing with this series."
3,My Scenes rules but..................,i dont really think this doll is worth the money paid. it kind of does look scary.i think madison dressed to impress is more beautiful than her. i would suggest her over barbie. thank you.ps the accessories rock the worldSarah
2,"Very Basic, not as good as other books on this topic","There are other books on being your own contractor that are better. This book is not very insightful and offers basic ideas and concepts. For the price, there are better choices and more up to date books out there."
3,Artless?,"It's beyond me how anyone could describe the prose of Lonelyhearts and Locust as ""artless"" (as one reviewer did). I can understand how some might find the bitterness and despair of these two works not to their liking. But artless? Years after reading these two novels, I can recall entire passages by heart and picture the scenes vividly. Such effects are not achieved by artless amateur writers, only by those with considerable literary talent.That said, I must agree with the other reviewers here: The remaining stuff collected by LOA is distinctly second-rate, the product of West on a bad day or before he reached his stride. Only if you are a scholar researching twentieth-century American novelists should you buy this volume. Get the inexpensive paperback book published by New Directions, containing the two imperishable works Lonelyhearts and Locust."
4,Quality Knives,These were given to us as a wedding present over 5 years ago. Ours get used at least weekly. We put them in the dishwasher and they wash up fine. Mine are still nice and sharp after 5 years of use too. At $100 they are a very good value for the price. I looked them up on here for a gift for my mother for their second home.
4,Great knives,"I have used these knives for several years and look forward to using them whenever possible. I have never experienced the ""tearing"" as described above. I looked for them on this site so I could give them as a gift to friends."
4,Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet 8-piece Steak Knife Set with box,I like these Henckels steak knives very much. Exactly what I wanted. The box is very handy to have also.
4,Hope these are as good as they used to be.,"I bought a 4-piece set of these for my wife while we were dating (around 2003). Those were made in Germany; these are made in Spain and the 'little squares' configuration is different (I don't know what that means). I purchased the set of 8 to augment our set for 12 dinners, the 8 piece set went for 78$ (in 2012), the old set of 4 for 36$ (in 2003). I'm hoping the newer ones hold up as well as the older one, which are still in great condition."
1,"Beware, they rust and can cat your fingers","This has been quite a disappointing purchase. The knives arrived in a nice box and look good but after only 8 months are developing rust spots on the blade. Even more disappointing, the top of the blade is sharp enough to cut your finger if you press hard, for example to separate a chicken thigh from the body. I have given them to a friend in need and I am looking for a better choice. Save your money on this one.Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet 8-Piece Steak Knife Set with Box"
4,Adequate Cutlery,"I purchased these knives after having purchased and returned mundial steak knives that had great blades, but the black plastic handles faded after only one hand washing. These knives have serrated blades and are fine for cutting steak on a plate, and I don't think I would want steak knives to be any sharper than what these are, because if so, they would damage my dinner plates. You aren't supposed to wash them in the dishwasher, but I have several times now and they came through as good as new. The rose wood box is nothing special, but it's okay. Overall, for the price, I'm quite happy with these knives."
5,Great Set Of Knifes!!,"I just received these knifes and I was very pleased. The quality was great on the knifes and the box was even nice. You are always hesitant buying something without seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised with this set. For the money you just can't beat it."
3,Not as pictured,"I just received these knives yesterday and as a previous reviewer indicated, the knives I received were NOT made in Germany as the product description said, on the knives themselves (metal blade) it is stamped ""Made in Spain"". Also the box is not as pictured but is another type of wooden box with the lighter inside (no dark felt lining).Hopefully the knives are the same quality, but I am just disappointed that the product description and images are misleading."
2,Warning!! Inaccurate and misleading description,"Just received these knives and noticed the items were not exactly as pictured. Upon examining I noticed the package was marked ""Knives Made in Spain""The item description on Amazon clearly states ""Made in Germany"" Called Henckles Customer Service, and they confirmed these knives are indeed made in Spain. Every website that carries these describe this item as made in Germany, which, based on my own perception means a higher quality product. I feel cheated. The word ""Germany"" is stamped on the knife blades, which according to the manufacturer should say ""Spain"" Just another example of the consumer being ripped off."
2,Cheap box from China. Not the nice henckel's knives you're used to.,"I have another version of this set that I bought locally. It was much, much nicer. Thought I was getting a deal but was sorely disappointed when the product arrived. Sent it back immediately."
5,Excellent!,"My kids love this and just like the other reviewers said, they NEVER tire of it. This is well worth the price."
2,Filter For Outside Use ONLY,"I was not impressed. After attaching this filter to a garden hose, it leaked badly where the hose attaches to the filter. I tried a different hose washer with no improvement. The first gallon or so of water that ran through the filter came out looking black to gray. The filter apparently uses charcoal as the filter material. I would not purchase again."
3,Maybe something else next time.,I think the filter itself works just fine. The flexible hose protector that came with it squirted water out of every joint. It was worthless and could not use it.
3,Good Filter,"Does what it's supposed to. I ran into problems with leaks at either ends. The threaded ends are plastic and can be stripped out. Note - this filter is supposed to be replaced every so often. Because of the possibility of leaks, once you get it connected to the long and short hoses you'll want to keep it connected."
2,More Plastic connections,"Once again, plastic where metal should be. It required plumber's tape and pliers to eliminate leaks at both ends. It's as though 99% of manufacturers cheapen their products to the point they no longer do their intended jobs."
3,Nice filter,Don't have much to say Since I have only used it for a few weeks on my camper I have used a similiar one. The water seems to be odorless and the connection was easy.
3,did I get a used filter?,"Received this product promptly. I ordered 2. When I began to open the first package, I noticed the blister pack had been opened previously. I then noticed a significant amount of sand in the intake screen. I'm not sure I received a new, unused filter."
3,Why pay this much.,"If you are using this for the drinking water filter on an RV, skip the expensive filters and go to your hardware store and buy one for your icemaker at a fraction of the price and does the same job."
5,And it really works,"Great filter...takes out everything......attach it to your hose, wash your car and no water spots...NONE...assuming you have hard water like in our area.Perfect packaging, easy to install, great for your RV too if oyu have one....."
3,just OK,"I am using this for my clothes washer. Not sure if its really getting the Cl out or not, but it might be...."
5,Does a great job of elemenating odor from our Hunting Camp well water,Easy to use. Very effective in elemenating well water odors. I've used them for years.It lasts months before it needs changing.
5,Good filter,I bought this filter to use on my rv while camping & plan to use it next years camping season.
5,Great Filter!,"A water filter is a very simply but essential device when you are RV'ing. Water quality tends to vary widlely from site to site. Having a filter helps with removing particulate matter and does improve the taste and smell of well water. This one is very well made, does not leak at either end and is easy to store when not in use.I tend to change the filter with each season of use."
4,Good idea,"I have no idea what the water tasted like without the filter but it was tasty with it. Given the price, why risk crappy tasting water."
4,Great filter,I have been using this filter on a cruising boat for the last 3 years. The water varies alot from Florida to the Bahamas and the filter always provides consistent clear and odor free water.
2,Only removes about 1/2 the chlorine,"I tested before and after with a water quality kit. Unfortunately, this only removed about 1/2 the chlorine, leaving a substantial amount."
4,Removes some odors,"Seems to be a good product but does not remove all the odors associated with the water. It wasn't advertised to take out all the odor,just greatly reduce them. We had some odors from water in a local campground. No taste issues so I think that was o.k and the odor wasn't all that bad but don't think it will take out all odors competely."
4,The Patriarch: The Bingham Dynasty,"I have been interested in Kentucky history since my daughter went to Univ. of Kentucky. Since the Binghams owned the Lexington Herald and Louisville Courier and were in politics as well, I just found interesting. But, the tragedy and fascinating facts of their lives was astonishing."
3,strong smell but good shape,the cd had a strong cigareet smell at the same time the cd was in good shape other then the very strong smell.
4,Good quality HDMI cables,The ferrite cores help protect against EMI. Worked great between my Intel Core i3-based home theater PC and a Sony receiver.
4,A Fela Flashback!,"TONY ALLEN's ""Black Voices"" CD is a downtempo percussion parade from the former drummer in FELA KUTRI's band.Filled with african rhythyms, deep bouncy basslines that swoon back and forth, I was shocked at how much I liked this CD. Which is amazing since there about 6 tracks with 2 versions of 2 tracks, to give you a total of 8 tracks. Some tracks could definitely get airplay in a more progessive crowd and some hark back to traditional percussions.Not a must have, but a CD worth checking out if you're into World music or percussions."
5,Afrobeat2000!,"AFROBEAT-FUKADELIC fans will not be disappointed with this visionary release from Comet Records (Paris). Tony Allen, drummer/bandleader for the late Fela Kuti, free styles his should-be-patented afrobeat grooves amidst percussive guitars, wha-distorted keyboards, flamed djembes and loud, driving bass and brass while P-Funk All-Stars vocalists Clip Payne and Mudbone Cooper coax you into the psycho sexual dance mix. This music makes hip-hop sound really dull."
5,hypnotic masterpiece,"For some reason this amazing piece is quite hidden. Unbelievable sound with the sweetest, sexiest groove. This is futuristic voodoo; mesmerizing stoned, smoky repetitions that bring out the nasty spots in your soul and leave you purified. These are black voices indeed. It might not show all its powers right away, but belive me, girls go wet on this; boys crazy.Non only so effective, this is highly innovative and opens up a new musical path, combining the old afro-beat with a roots dub spirit and an electronic influenced repetitiveness. don't miss this"
2,Slow response,I received this product in a very timely manner and quickly followed instructions for returning the test for analysis and as of Oct. 5th haven't heard a word from them. They mentioned it would take 7-10 days to process and return the results. I have as yet to hear or see anything of the test results. I received this product on or around Sept. 2nd.
1,Kids Next Dorks,"My brother bought this game, I played it a few times. It is ssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooo dumb. Anyone who reads this review plese answer, what's better Teen Titans or Kids Next Door?Teen Titans is the Best TV show EVER!!!, Care bears is funner than Kids Next Door. Numbah 2 is so fat and stupid. Numbah 4 is just plain itiotic. Numbah 1's accent is so fake he trys to sound British, but then how come his last name is Uno that sounds Spanish. Don't get me sterted on them spelling stuff wrong and saying NUMBAH. What's wrong with adults? Without parents we wuodn't have been born! The videogame is dumb, Kids Next Door the TV show is stupid. I would rather watch Power Puuff Girls than Kids Next Dorks! I hate K.N.D.!!!!!"
3,It's okay.,"Although I love tea and drink it all the time, I thought the Scottish Breakfast Tea was just okay. I also ordered Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey Tea, and it is WONDERFUL! The best Earl Grey Tea I have had. As for Breakfast Tea, I guess my favorite is still Trader Joe's Irish Breakfast Tea."
4,It's not a surprise,"I've been drinking it for years, but had trouble getting it. It was exactly as advertised and it arrived promptly."
4,Trouble Don't Last Always,"Allen & Allen, another great act in the tradition of gospel/jazz. But anyone with an interest in gospel music will appreciate this CD. And with Daryl Coley at the vocal helm of the title track, you'll understand. My personal favorite, ""Trouble Don't Last Always""."
2,Really disappointed for the price...,"I got these counters for my son I am homeschooling. I had hesitated because of some other reviews that were less than stellar but went ahead and bought them. I wish I'd now purchased one of the other items amazon offers. First off, these counters are tiny. That in and of itself doesn't bother me--but the quality is very cheap. The plastic is brittle and you could hear the counters groaning as i broke them apart.Considering the fact that they weren't separated and had no container to keep them in, the price of this item is too high to be worthwhile. If you're looking at buying these counters? Spend a little more and get a better quality product. I wish I had."
5,Great little learning product,"When I ordered this product, I really didn't think it would get much use. We actually use these more than any other math manipulative we have. Being see thru, we use them for so much more than counters. Put them on 100's chart to use for skip counting. Use them to mark places or sorting."
3,bingo,thought they were going to be bigger cannot see through them too good I would not buy them again for bingo
5,Classroom tool,This is a great teaching tool in the math classroom. My students love to use these for many different games we play in stations.
5,"This timeless classic film is surely worth a second viewing!""","""Trains have always fascinated me and when I was told that this was a movie about a railroad company, I just had to have a copy. I wasn't disappointed. The director has done a fabulous job of capturing the daily grind of railroad workers and the plot is just out of this world. Unlike other low-budget suspense thrillers, this movie keeps you guessing, not about whodunit, but how it was done, till the very end. Yes, the plot may seem absurd by today's hi-tech standards, but you have to admit that it was far ahead of its time. This timeless classic film is surely worth a second viewing!"""
1,Appalling quality,"This is a NO STAR item actually, but as 1 star means 'I hate it', I've given it one.I really have no idea what the film is like. This is because the quality of the copy I was sent, at the rip off price of about $25 (Australian) was beyond belief. The sound was inaudible, the picture so scratched and faded it was barely viewable, and the tracking was worse than the worst VHS tape I have ever seen. I counted 6 complete 'blackouts' on screen before I gave up & turned it off. On top of that, the sleeve insert was a crudely and faintly photocopied effort that didn't even fit in the sleeve properly.It is fit only for the rubbish bin: to post it back to the amateurish vendor would cost even more money. Be warned!!"
4,A Good Review of the History of Folktale Studies,"The Folktale is an interesting book, although one which is uneven in quality. Most of it consists of quick sketches of particular tale types or motifs. These presentations are too voluminous and repetitive to make really interesting reading, but are too brief to be very insightful about any particular topic. The best part of the book is Part IV, Studying the Folktale, which presents a synopsis of the history and status of folktale studies (as of 1946). Even those who are skeptical of Thompson's general historic-geographical methodology may find this discussion valuable and provocative."
4,Balloons,"Other than the price one pays for this binding (which in itself is remarkably done), this book reads as searing and yet as smooth as one might expect, as one who has come to adore Bibesco. She is wit, raw edginess and human emotive in one pristine hardcover."
1,Doesn't work,"A friend of mine who is from Africa (living in Dallas, Tx.) bought the software and installed it. He found that he could no longer access the internet! So he had to uninstall it. Sad, because he really needs it (he's more fluent in French than English.) I'm always suspicious of software that says it will work with Win95! I mean, what's with that?I've been researching to see if anyone else had trouble."
3,"Nice watch, medium quality","I bought it as a present to my girl friend. It is a nice watch but it lacks quality, because after two months of use it's colors began fading."
4,The Other Woman -,I have just dicovered Brenda Novak's books and reallylike all that I have read - the romance books notsuspence - I have all of the Dundee Idaho and the firsttwo of the Whiskey Creek and her next on preorder - this must tell anyone that I am and wil be a fan of her books.
4,Brenda you amaze me.,"I have been reading the Dundee Idaho series and honestly I wasn't sure Brenda could pull this one off. I didn't know how anyone could and make it an enjoyable read. Elizabeth was the other woman and thought she was married but instead her 'husband' was leading a double life and was legally married to someone else. This all gets discovered in another book. She is living in the same town with her 'ex-husband' and his ex-wife who is married to Elizabeth's brother. ARE YOU GETTING THIS LOL. However, Brenda writes this amazing story very well. I totally enjoyed how Elizabeth and Carter's love develops....If you haven't read this series and decide you want to start with this book, you could. BUT to totally enjoy get them all and start at the beginning. (the series is priced inexpensive on kindle) I LOVE this series."
5,Understand how marketers manipulate you!,"This book is written for marketers.If you're a consumer, don't fail to read it - especially if you shop too much and save too little!Delves into the reasons consumers want things and can be manipulated into believing they need them.- Eric TysonAuthor of Personal Finance for Dummies and Mind Over Money: Your Path to Wealth and Happiness"
2,50% Too Long,The book could have given you the message in half the pages. I found about ten pages of really good information but a lot of fluff as well.
1,old news,"I've heard the authors speak on radio about this book and her insights about why people buy, but there is nothing here that you couldn't pick up in an elementary book on consumer behavior. The author states essentially that people buy for more than functional reasons, but instead for emotional and social reasons. These are ancient ideas...it's like saying that people falling in love is a new need."
2,Not the kind of book I was looking for,"I thought this was a book to help consumers realize why they buy things they don't need, and thereby stop doing it. But it's the opposite -- it's aimed at helping businesses tap into our buying impulses and sell us MORE stuff! If you're a business looking to raise your sales, you might like this, but it was not at all what I wanted."
3,Entertaining and sexy,"I found this movie entertaining and,with Marilyn's portrayal,very sexy. Tom Ewell was at his funniest and the perfect actor for this role."
4,Cute!,"I thought ""The Seven Year Itch"" was a very funny movie. I really felt MM's performance - it's a pity she never got any really good parts. She's fantastic. OMG, read the book ""Blonde""... NOW!But I digress. Some of the scenes, especially the piano scene, I found to be hilarious, and the comedic timing was perfect. From one person with a runaway imagination to another... I hear ya, buddy! Overall, this movie exceeded my expectations... I really liked it. Definitely worth a rent, at least."
5,The Perfect Couple Comedy,"I have always loved this movie. It is such a fun film.Tom Ewell is perfect as the neurotic, imaginative summer ""bachelor"" husband. Marilyn Monroe is perfect as the bubbly blonde model from upstairs. Together they are a hilarious comedy duo.Ewell plays a husband abandoned in the city by his wife and child as they enjoy a summer retreat, but the poor guy cannot stop living in his head. His wild imagination leads him to outrageous (and laughable) conclusions. That is until Monroe almost kills him with a potted tomato plant. Carefree and silly, she gives his dreams the possibility for reality. But once again, his imagination gets the better of him.If you want a wholesome laugh at some truly awkward and hilarious situations, give it a try. And for the rest of you Marilyn Monroe fans, this is a must own!"
5,THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH { BLU-RAY },"How can anyone NOT buy this movie in blu-ray. What a difference over the regular dvd, This is one of my favorite movies of her, and comparing it to my regular dvd the blu-ray blows it away. I sometimes have [2] decks hooked up in my system and can go back & forth from deck to deck. I match up the scenes on both decks & keep flipping back & forth, & the blu-ray wins hands down, no questions asked ! I would recommend this to any & all Marilyn fans. What a treat to see her in a movie in the first place & now to see her in this far better quality version. I say go get this in blu-ray & if you have the dvd go ahead & throw it as far away as you can. You won't be watching it anymore, I guarantee. I can only comment here on the video portion as I don't have a fancy sound system. It sounds ok to me anyway."
4,Entertaining madcap comedy,"This is a light-weight, clever treatment of the theme of the seven years' itch. A good, loyal husband is determined to remain that way, but what can you do when your upstairs neighbor is Marylin Monroe, at once as naive and innocent as a child, and as sexy (unaware to herself) as a siren? Lots of fun."
5,The seven year itch Blu-ray scratches with extras,The movie itself is beautifully remastered and has 3 documentaries 2 new 1 old the first documentary is Monroe and Wilder an intersection of genius and the second documentary is called Fox movie Channel presents fox legacy about the seven year itch with Tom Rothman and the third documentary Hollywood backstory the seven year itch also includes commentary by Kevin Lally from Billy Wilder biographer and interior active Marilyn Monroe movies timeline and when you click on to the special feature On certain movies on the timeline there is a little biography video and also includes the Hays code picture and picture sexual innuendo meter special feature also includes behind the scenes galleries publicity Galleries and advertising Galleries and still galleries and you could also change the speaking Language from English to Spanish Italian and other languages one of Marilyn Monroe's sexy and funniest comedies by Billy Wilder
4,Tom Ewell saves the day,"The first 30 minutes of this movie was hilarous, I was laughing so hard. But as it goes on, it is kind of dragging.I think the movie depends a lot on the major charactor Richard and his entertaining imaginations. The guy who played him, Tom Ewell, is wonderful. I am a little disappointed by Marilyn Monroe's role however. Her job in this film was just walking around wearing different sexy dresses (no complain here but I was expecting more)Playing a dumb girl, she really under-utilized her talent. But I guess she had no control over it. Come to think of it, how dumb people were just a few decades ago, when they thought ""pretty blondes are dumb"" kind of jokes are funny? Waaaaaay out of fashion these days."
1,"WRONG ,WRONG... WRONG","TWICE THEY SENT ME THE WRONG DVD, AND THEN THEY REMOVE THE ONE I ACTUALLY ORDERED, AND THEY PROMISED TO SEND MEIT AFTER THERE MANY SCREW UPS, AND YET NOW THE ONE I WANT IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN BLUE RAY.I BELIEVE IF YOU PROMISE SOMEONE SOMETHING YOU SHOULD HAVE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY NEVER DO WHAT THEY SAY.THEN THE PERSON WHO IS SUPPOSE TO CORRECT IT DOES NOTHING. SHAME ON AMAZON.ITS SAD WHEN YOU ORDER AN ITEM AND THEY CAN'T EVEN SEND YOU THE ITEM THAT YOU ORDERED.THE COVER IS NOT THE SAME, AND ITS WIDESCREEN. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU SEE IF WHAT YOUGET, BUT AMAZON IS CURRENTLY NOT PROVIDING PRODUCTS THAT MATCH THE ITEM YOU ORDER."
2,Casting mistake,"Tom Ewell/ Richard Sherman was unwatchable in this movie. I thought he was hideous, irritating, ridiculous and boring. He wasn't at all funny. Who wants to watch an entire movie where this imbecile talks to himself the entire time? I could not stand him; he was abhorable.He ruined the movie for me, but I gave it as many stars as I did because Marilyn was in it. She was glorious. She was fabulous.And there was that legendary white dress.I couldn't give it the insultory one star, because She was in it. But I couldn't give it any higher than 2 because of Ewell, he was that disturbing to me."
3,"Potential, but lacking...","They came close with this book, but unfortunately, the first part of the book is just a bit too theoretical for the real world.If the authors included some real world examples to bring the theory into practice, the book would be a real winner.The second part of the book again does not present any examples for the projects.Not looking for cookbook-recipe book, but examples would have made the second part of this book more of a winner.I am still debating on opening the CD and keeping the book...I will have to digest the theory and make the decision from that point."
4,trying to read it is a good way to start thinking,"I am usually highly critical of professional points of view in the social sciences. People who think we can be guided by our own ideas if we crush the resistances of those who do not accept our own ability to make up our own minds have to deal with too much confabulation by thinkers who resemble an obese mouse with a stationary form of life solely devoted to eating. The brain can use a large portion of the energy distributed by the blood, but the science based on mice does not do much to establish human superiority over the speed of neutrons in nuclear reactors, which curious people rarely try to understand because subatomic pockets in our universe are less common in our personal experience than the discovery of cold fusion with creeping crud."
2,Humor that has lost its' punch over time,"Since this book was first printed in 1950, the humor contained within it is very dated. As is always the case with books of humor, there is a wide range in the level of chuckles that the stories will generate, some none and others a great deal. However, due to the context, most of the stories will generate little more than a smile, as they really are not all that humorous to the modern reader. The book is interesting as a historical retrospective of humor but other than that it is at times tedious reading."
3,Don't Get Your Hopes Up...,"THE ISLAND MONSTER is about a drug-smuggling operation in Italy. Boris Karloff is the eeevil, murderous mastermind, killing and kidnapping his way into our hearts. He does his best to salvage this so-called ""thriller"", but the dullness is overwhelming, even for him! This is a very sllloooww-moving drama, so don't expect any chills or horror! My favorite part is the English dubbing, especially the ultra-annoying daughter of the main cop on the case! Hilarious! Her shrieks and wails could curdle mercury! Still, if you enjoy all things Boris, you might as well add this one to your collection..."
3,BUEN SERVICIO DEL VENDEDOR,"EL SERVICIO DEL VENDEDOR AUNQUE NO TUVE CONTACTO CON EL FUE BUENO, CON SUS FECHAS DE ENTREGA, Y CALIDAD DEL PRODUCTO. AHORA BIEN LA PELICULA TIENE UN ARGUMENTO DE MUY POCO INTERES."
2,VERY DARK PIC,The movie was very dark. hard to watch it. It was like it had a filter or was a bad dvd.
4,Nadine,My wife saw this movie on T.V. awhile back and thought it was funny and asked me if I ever ran across it on DVD to get a copy of it. I was looking for another DVD on Amazon when I saw the title and ordered one for my wife. She was very pleased!! Thanks for stocking such a variety of DVD's for us to choose from!!
1,Stove refutes a ridiculous straw man version of skepticism,"As explained well by Indurkhya (1990), Strove misrepresents the thesis that he claims to refute. Hume's claim was that no matter how many objects we observe, we cannot conclude anything about unobserved objects. Stove's formal version of this claim says that no matter how many objects we observe, we cannot conclude anything - period. Of course this straw man version is wrong, since we can certainly conclude something about the things we have already seen. But this is irrelevant to Hume's claim, which is concerned with the things we have not yet seen. Duh!"
3,time will tell,"i use these tapes to edit movies on my mac. i don't see a noticeable difference between it & the consumer grade you get at wal-mart. however, i was told that these are easier on the machines involved, camera, inbox, etc. i guess only time will tell. i don't know another way to figure it out."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"CQ, 1969 filmThe story starts in an apartment where a man is taking monochrome home movies in 1969. [Didn't they have color then?] Then there is a surprise. This is filmed to look very amateurish and unpolished. But this doesn't fool anybody. The script sounds like something a student would write. No ending? No sale? ""Shut down the production"" says the producer. ""This is the worst."" This movie seems to get worse as it runs on!There are changes in personnel. They plan a science fiction movie set on the dark side of the moon. ""World Council Headquarters"" plans to hire agent ""Dragonfly"" to capture the secret weapon. The director offers his plans to finish the movie, then start on a vampire movie. [Was there a market then? Do they seem clueless? Its in the script.]How much longer can you watch this? Has this work improved with age? You can't know how bad this is until you watch it. [The title is a radio call to commence a conversation.]"
1,Extremely Disapointed,"As someone who has enjoyed In Like Flint and Barbarella and other movies of the era, I thought this movie would be along the same lines. After watching CQ I found out it couldn't have been farther from the truth. The movie within the movie was interesting and would have made the movie more enjoyable if it was done better. The ""Secret Agent"" part of the movie would have made a great ""B"" movie if it was more than just a short portion of the film. However the ""real"" part of the movie left a lot to be desired."
3,Slow,"I found this movie to be rather slow and therefore disappointing. Although it's filled with some great ideas and references to other movies that might have made it fun to watch, it just seems to drag along without really getting to a point soon enough."
2,Accessible but Short-- 15 min,"This was more accessible for younger students than some DVDs on the subject, but I was a little disappointed to discover it was only 15 minutes long."
5,"It is everything that you want, for alot less.","I have two ms optical's and the micro innovations mouse. I use the <b>Micro Innovations mouse for gaming</b>... that is the best review i could write. When it is on the line, i like the grip on this mouse the best."
3,works well but PS2 not USB,"The mouse is packaged well and works as I expected. I was happy to find an optical mouse at such a good price.The description says USB interface though and this is a PS2 interface mouse. There isn't a PS2 to USB adapter or anything like that in the kit either. Fortunately, I can use it on the PS2 port for the machine I needed it for."
4,Works great on the right surface,"This is a good mouse...the buttons and scroll wheel have just the right touch. My only complaint is that I still have to use a mouse pad even though it is optical because it goes crazy when I use it on the wood-grain pattern of my desk. I don't know if this would happen with other optical mice, or if it is a problem common to all of them."
3,Does not work properly with some applications...,"I purchased and installed this product for a client of mine. I'm a computer consultant/technician. The installation was very easy. Sadly, the scroll wheel feature does not function properly in Microsoft Access from Office 97.My client has a database with 768 entries. No matter where you are in this database, if you scroll up you go non-stop to record number one. If you scroll down you go non-stop to record number last. I have not found any way to stop this process.Curiously, when you use the scroll wheel in other applications, it works pretty much as one would expect it to. I've found a few cases where it doesn't do anything, however.Compared to any of the Logitech or Microsoft mice I've installed and/or used, I believe the software driver for this mouse may leave something to be desired.I will update this review if and when the manufacturer replies to my email to their tech support department with a solution."
5,compassion at its peak of human suffering,I saw this movie way back when it first came out; I searched everywhere for it and found it. Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita portrayed the characters flawlessly showing a heart wrenching tale of love between interracial lines. A better understanding of what the japanese endured is touched upon. An unforgettable movie that touches your perspective in the human profiling system.
4,Romantic & Unforgetable,"I really enjoyed this movie because it made me feel. It was romantic, tragic and educational. I don't know how accurate it is because I wasn't there and didn't live through it, but from what little I learned about it in high school it seemed accurate enough. It's not all about the camps we kept Japanese-Americans in. It's a love story. If you like love stories, you'll like this one."
4,A SLEEPER OF A GOOD MOVIE,"THIS IS A SLEEPER OF A GOOD MOVIE, WHICH TELLS THE STORY OF THE INJUSTICE THAT WAS DONE TO JAPANESE AMERICAN PEOPLE DURING WW2.EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES BY ALL.A LOVE STORY THAT IS ALSO VERYINFORMATIVE."
3,A Good Watch!,"I recommend this movie for its beautiful romantic story with historical backdrops (WWII, Japanese interns, etc), great chemistry between the 2 leads (Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita) and the lovely photography. Dennis Quaid looked so handsome and wholesome here (I don't understand - how could Meg?!)Tamlyn Tomita shines here as well (she's also adorable in movies like ""Karate Kid"" and ""The Joy Luck Club"")."
4,JA Henckels Twin Gourmet 18pcs set,"There is a very intresting review here saying the double tribal man is the one that is made in Germany. Well I just got a set of knifes, all the steak knifes Made in Spain, it is on the blade marked, the rest of the knifes does not marked at all where they were made, but I dought they are made in Germany, time will tell, I love knifes and have some specials in my collection, but this is a shock to me, that ""German"" knifes made in Spain.I'm from Europe and Germans are very precies and value quality, so will see about this set."
4,Great Feedback Everyone,"We bought this as a wedding present and I had it shipped to my house first because I wanted to get the furniture pads if the steak knives poked through the bottom but our block was solid under the steak knives so I think they must have corrected that problem. Because of all the great reviews I was prepared for the light weight aspect of these knives and when I first pulled out the 8"" carving knife I was pretty bummed. Still the Chef's knife was almost the same weight as a Wusthof we have so I'm happy with the gift. If it's a great knife, who says it has to be heavy."
1,Cheapo and poor quality- don't buy,"My husband and I have been researching for over a year for a nice heavy duty block and quality knife set and this is not it. Not only does it look cheap, not all the knives fit in the slots in the block. We currently own a cheap no-name set that we were looking to upgrade with this Henckels set but our no-name set is better quality and better looking than this set! We expected a lot more for $300.. don't waste your money. The previous comments on this item couldn't possibly have received what we got."
2,Missing a few things,This has some great pictures of the Grand Tetons. And only one of Glacier National Park. There are many wildlife pictures and some of the canadian rockies. Generally it's a great picture book of the Grand Tetons.
3,devotions,"I am enjoying this devotional. The daily words are uplifting and encouraging. This is a good selection to be used as a daily reader.Having read this for several months, one thing bothers me. Mary Tilleston did not write anything. Each day starts with a couple Bible verses, than that is followed by short spiritual writing's by various people. She gives there name usually using first initials and last name. No footnote as to who this person may be. Spiritual does not necessarily mean Christ centered."
1,Not worth it....,"Not really a good devotional. Need something more upbeat, like Joyce Meyers. Take the time and get a sample first."
2,Tame,"Not too inspiring. It's just wordy, and not the kind of words that make me sit up and think. Could use more variety and common wisdom."
3,Good Devotional,"It is written in ""older English"" which I like but some people may find it problematic. I love the scripture verses!"
3,A Little Difficult to Understand at Times,"Great for a quick devotional reading. However, sometimes it is a little hard to understand because it is an older style of writing."
3,Daily inspiration,"This book has devotionals that can be easily read in under 5 minutes. For me, however, the bible translation that is used for the Bible verses is one that is not in the plain language that I am used to reading in the Living Translation or others with more modern phrasing. Also, the inspirational selections are more poetry than prose. I find a publication like Daily Guideposts more inspiring for my daily devotions."
3,A little disappointed,"I was disappointed in this version, because it had no index. My older version (1940's) had an index of authors for the poems and an index for the prose."
5,One of the best common sense devotionals,"To hear brothers and sister from back in the 1200's to 1800's share there encouragements and lessons they have learned from drawing close to our Lord, has been very helpful in my walk with the HIM. It is truly like they are here with us today, and of cause, because God never changes.Each of us has a box of tools, more or less, to share with others, for a closer walk with Him. This book is full of these tools. I highly recommend this daily reader.But I caution you, each page is for one days devotion and it is very hard to just read a days devotion and not continue ahead."
3,"interesting book, poorly formatted","An insteresting book, with daily short, often biblical, and inspirational quotes. Greatly marred by the format; a large, coffee-table book size, with an abundance of white spaces and extra lines, each day of reading is either mashed together with several other days or spills over onto other pages. Far better, would have been a small, compact diary-like presentation with each day encapsulated on a page or more. Curiously, no publisher is listed - only Lexington, KY - I don't blame them for not wanting to be credited for republishing what should have been a loving tribute to Mary Wilder Tileston."
1,dumb book,dont like it dont like it dont like it dont like it dont like it dont like it dont this is so dumb
1,Not worth the money,"Not worth the money. Hard to read, hard to understand. WOuldn't pay for it. Glad it was free on the Kindle. Not written in language that is easy to understand."
4,Good Devotional Book,"This is a good devotional book with scriptural references and nice poetry and commentary. It, like 'Ye Shall Receive Power' is for the mature Christian ... it is challenging and inspiring, though to me not as good as ""Ye Shall Receive Power"". I recommend both of these devotional books. I had both downloaded directly to my Kindle."
3,daily stength,is ok - look at it at times.. ddn't hold my atteniton that much.. or that well... but is good...
4,I ordered this for my friend who is without capability to order online,"It was perfect for her. It was the perfect price and it was delivered on time. She needed this book for her spiritual studies and it worked. Price wise, quality wise delivery wise it was all good.I gave it four stars only because it was not for me and I am not the one reading it"
5,A title from the End of Your Life Book Club,"I am reading this little inspirational book each day. It is short but meaningful quotes, verses and thoughts.... a wonderful way to begin the day. Please note: the downloadable free Kindle version does not use contemporary language, but more in the style of the original text, as well as the King James version of verses.To me, the language style does not detract from the meaning, but rather enhances it. Each day the reader has a Bible verse, 5-10 line poem and a quote that all tie together. These would be inspiring to read aloud at the start of meetings, clubs, etc..."
4,comforting reading,I have looked forward to each day with this book. It is well put together and comforting reading to begin your day.
1,Comments not written in present language.,The comments in this book are not really life applicable. There are many devotionals that are better written in my opinion.
4,Daily Strengths for Daily Livings,"I had read about the book in The End of Your lIfe Book Club. I am looking forward to reading it day by day. I like the fact that it incorporates several different ""kinds"" of sources for each day - some Biblical, some poetic, some philosophical. It's a very nice blend of traditions. thank-you."
5,"wonderfully helpful,inspiring, positively addictive","Some people look forward to their first cup of coffee in the morning , and it is that kind of ""I can't wait to read this morning's message"" that I greet my book every day. It never fails to be a word in due season, encouraging, useful food for thought; simple messages to contemplate your entire day.Its a habit I am better off to keep."
2,What the heck is this?,I'm not sure what this does. A friend of mine suggested it would help with my memory problems and another suggested it would help me sleep better but it has done neither.
5,Excellent Collection,"This Bonnie Tyler's two-CDs package is worthy. Althought she has not had a large collection of big hits like Streisand or Madonna, this collection includes all her 5 chart hits plus some excellent renditions of other artists' songs along with more songs of her own albums where she shows the great rock singer she is. The second CD includes long version of some of her ""classics"". In total 23 excellent tracks. It's really worthyThe CD is excellent and that's why I ranked it 5 stars"
3,Some great songs...,"I cannot claim to be a Bonnie Tyler fan. I love some of her hit songs such as TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART, however the pompous synthesizer style of music from the '80's grates on me. With that being said, their are some great tracks on this cd and some tragically lame ones as well. The bonus disk with the 12 inch releases makes this compilation worth buying. The extended version of TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART is fabulous (if not pompous and annoying.) Furthermore, the sound quality of the bonus disk is vastly superior to the primary disk, which detracts from my evaluation of this release. And if you are one who appreciates liner notes... do not buy this release. The liner notes (if you wish to call them that) consists of a fold out advertisement for a SONY walkman player."
1,Not worth $2.00,"Although this toy was inexpensive, it only worked one time. Regardless of refilling the top with baking powder, it only sinks and stays at the bottom."
4,Great product.,"It works great, although it seemed to work best the first time and not as well the second, but we've only done it twice now. Very entertaining for my kids. (3 yo girl and 4 yo boy)"
1,pass on this one,"My 5 year old loves subs and ships so he likes this however even with parental help he still found it frustrating to use with the baking soda. He will push it through the water in the tub I am sure. I would would get the Toysmith Wind-up Submarine 7"" over this. That has been a great toy for our boy."
1,worse than 1 star book,"I only read a few pages of this book,but, then I flipped through the pagesand found some stuff that was notappropriate for the characters' ages to doand for kids my age to read. I think this bookshould go on a ""must not read"" list.I think this book should not be injunior high school libraries."
5,Old Blues Piano,"I checked this out from my local library, and FINALLY found piano transcriptions of blues songs. This isn't a book about how to play the blues; this is the blues. The sheet music is in many different key signatures, not just the easy ones. The CD is only snippets of songs, but enough to feel the vibe of each song."
3,"Ok, but not exceptional","Nice binding and well constructed book, but I'm not impressed with the contents. Not the songs that I anticipated."
2,could be better,"i expected a better bookbut i bought to use with my students and anyway i think it'll be helpful, althougt maybe not as much as i thought"
3,J.A. Henckels,For the price this set is ok. I prefer a heavier knife but my wife loves the set . She likes the feel and they are very sharp. Time will tell how they will stand up to heavy usage.
4,cards:,Most of the cards are black and white. The description doesn't state this. However my kids (2-5 yrs old) LOVE working with this kit!
5,A good spicy snack,"The nutrition facts off the label are total fat 0.5g, saturated and trans fat 0g, cholesterol 25mg, sodium 600mg, carbohydrates 4g, fiber 0g, sugar 3g, protein 15g per one ounce serving.They have fresh peppercorns on them. The flavor may be too intense for some. If you like peppered bacon, than I am guessing that you will enjoy the flavor of this product."
2,If looking for all day crock-pot recipes - don't bother,"What a dissapointment. I was looking for a book with recipes in which I could set the crock pot up and go to work, coming home to dinner. Which is the reason why I bought it. This is not the book for that - these seem to be regular recipes that could be made in a regular oven much more easily. There is a significant amount of preparation for almost all of them, and I can't seem to find any benefit to using the crock pot rather than a regular oven, which sort of defeats the point. Most recipes take far less hours than are in a regular workday, or need to be turned off or stirred during cooking. Simply not worth the money unless you have a lot of time on your hands, or work from home."
1,Truly disappointing...,"UGH! This book was such a disappointment that I couldn't find a single recipe I wanted to try - I returned it the very next day.Based on the only review that was here, I thought I'd find nice, healthy stuff that was simple to do with little preparation... there were too many ""nut loaf""-type dishes for my taste, and most seemed to begin with time-intensive (""first, saute the onions in a frying pan"") steps. Also, possibly due to the quick-cooking veggie ingredients, many recipes were too short to suit working folks for daytime use AND too long for evening use (""4 hours on low"")...."
1,Warning....MIT not included,"I was disappointed to discover that major engineering schools such as MIT were not included in this catalog. This catalog is for foreign students planning to come to the the US to study engineering, not US high school students."
1,Save your money for tuition -- don't waste it on this guide,"While this book does list the 2,300 ABET-accredited programs, that is about all it does. It offers ""comprehensive program profiles"" on fewer than 100 of them. The first three schools I tried to look up (all major east coast universities) aren't included in the profiles. In addition, the tear-out postcards included make this look more like a marketing ploy than a useful guide. Bottom line: There is nothing here that you can't quickly find elsewhere -- for free. I'm in the middle of some serious research on these kinds of programs -- in an effort to make a college choice. This so-called guide was a major disappointment. It's going back for a refund."
1,software incompatible with my computer,"The Oxford Duden German Dictionary which I purchased is not compatible with Windows 7. This information is, I believe, available in very small print in the Amazon ads, and it is also available on the CD, again in very small print. It would be helpful if it could be made more prominent. I should imagine that several people who buy this software would have Windows 7. Buyer beware: if you have Window7, this product will prove to be useless to you."
5,Ease of Use in German Language,"Access to this German-American Dictionary is very simple. Yet more, the definitions are complete and give additional information about any given word or phrase that one puts in the space provided. I have found it very helpful."
1,Poor product. Does not work well.,"It is ok to get it if you just have to pay maybe 5 dollars or less, and don't mind if it does not work like you were led to believe. I tried to download one dictionary (Spanish) after my computer crashed, and it would not download a second time. My German one eventually stopping functioning, as if the producer planned it that way to get me to buy something more expensive."
3,"It's not that it's not very good, but","This is a very good and fun movie, but it it is a bit wackier than I like. For example, Bringing Up Baby, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, is also a great wacky movie, but sometimes it's too much so. This is even more crazy. I used to love both movies, but after awhile they grated a bit. If you've never seen this movie before and love the stars, I definitely recommend it. But I wouldn't buy it just because Cary Grant or Marilyn Monroe are the stars. Rent it first and make sure you love it."
5,Classic Comedy Starring the Silver Screens Greatest Legends,"This hilarious slapstick comedy stars Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers, and Marilyn Monroe, 3 of the Silvers Screen's greatest stars. Cary Grant, a doctor, develops a syrum that makes him younger. He tests it out and goes for a spin with his young, beautiful secretary, Marilyn Monroe! Later, his wife, Ginger Rogers tries it out, and finally, Grant and Rogers are like 5 year olds. Ginger is great when she goes into her ""childlike temper tantrums"" and in one scene, after the syrum has worn off on her, she finds a baby, and thinks it's her husband! This stuff is timeless--it was on the American Film Institute's 500 List of the greates comedies, and it is timeless, making it one of my favorite movies."
5,Nothin' Like the 50s,"Classic B&W comedy at its finest! This one is a must for movie lovers. Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe are priceless. I was only 3 years old when this film was released, but I can completely relate to the era...the innocence, the tongue-in-cheek humor and the glamour of men and women in their romantic finest. Cary and Ginger are the main course...they hold this film together...Marilyn is just a dessert. Add this one to your movie library before it's no longer available."
3,Add to your WW1 library - ranks with the best,Don't be put off if you have seen the second rate film of the same name. This is a well written and serious book which explores the complex and terminal experiences of a German pilot in the last months of WW1.
3,doesnt make your skin white,"package came on time, this doesnt make your skin white but this will help you have a regularly bowel..Ive been using it already for two months, I take 1 capsule every other day.."
5,L Glutathione will keep those free radicals at bay.,"I was encouraged to purchase this after reading about it on Amazon.com. I am using it to keep my brain healthy, and it seems to be doing the job. As we age I'm told that free radicals can damage the brain. I am using it in the hope of living a long brain healthy life."
5,excellent resource for artists,"i am hoping to do an intricate performance art piece based on the novel ""the name of the rose;"" however, many of the lush details and layers were lost on me, because i am not a historian or a scholar well-versed in semiotics... the task is still daunting, but i feel more confident having this ""hint book"" to fill me in on the background information. it renders the novel much more accessible to a lay person, and makes the story even MORE fascinating than it already is. i suggest that anyone reading ""the name of the rose"" should have a copy of this to help them along... also, there is a text that does this same task for dante's ""divine comedy"" (dante has a large influence on the novel, so reading dante will help the reader to understand the apocolyptic attitudes of the characters). joseph gallagher wrote ""a modern reader's guide to dante's 'the divine comedy'"" which you may also find helpful."
4,The Key to the Name of the Rose,"After reading The Name of the Rose with few helps, discovering this book was quite wonderful. It goes into adaquate detail with the historical background, and I found the translations to be good and very helpful. A must for those trying the novel for the first time or for those who felt the lack of endnotes frustrating. A wonderful suppplement."
1,No mas!,"The final entry in the ""Omen"" trilogy actually oudoes its predecessors: it represents the nth degree of cinematic tripe. Sam Neill's rendering of Antichrist conveys all the subtlety of horns, goatee and pitchfork. Moreover, his mass assassination of British infants could not be more ludicrous: such stuff really out-Herods Herod! Finally, the Bad Man's defeat plunges to a level of bathos unequaled in the annals of anticlimax: it makes one long for the old Elizabethan stage wherein demons made their exit through a trap door while flinging fireworks at this Sinful World!Less horrific than horrible, ""The Omen 3"" is simply the nadir of filmmaking: an utter waste of time and celluloid. Is it any wonder that horror film cognoscenti--real Goths--prefer European and Japanese movies to such feculent products of Hollywood?"
4,Omen 3: The Final Conflict (1981)-Not bad for number 3.,Omen 3: The Final Conflict (1981) was a four star sequel and pretty darn good for number three in any series. The best thing about this film was that it introduced many of us to Sam Neill who was quite good in the role of Damien. After this movie I started taking note of all the films that he made.
5,World Demonation,"Damien is all grown up here, & has taken his place as President of 'Thorn Industries', a global conglomerate incorperating everything from product manufacture to food charities, & is firmly allied with the UN {of course}.In the darkest of plans, children are sacrificed, a politician commits suicide {by the auspice of satanical forces}, & the homicidal efforts of a secret xian order to murder Damien Thorn rotinelt prove to be ineffectual & laughable.Thorn has his own ""Ritual Chamber"", in which the nazarene is crucified, not inverse as you would expect, but turned around so that his naked posterior shows most humiliatingly. Thorn blasphemously rants at the nazarene in a messe noiresque fashion, & shows what proves to be one of the most powerfully sacriligeous scenes in cinematographic history.""Nazarene......you have won NOTHING....."""
2,"Interesting, but Not as Good as Omen I and II","The Final Conflict continues to carry the theme from the first two movies although the 'power' of this movie seemed diminished from the first two installments. I would have thought Damien would have ascended to a higher station in the world (e.g., President, leader of the UN) in the 'final conflict' between the forces of good and evil. The absence of an Armageddon type of scenario also took away from the magnitude this movie could have possessed. I wonder if a limited budget affected how the sreen play was developed? The sex scene was unnecessary although it appeared that Damien's relationship with the woman was part of his undoing. If one is interested in seeing an Armageddon version of Omen III go and rent Omega Code II - Meggido. David York plays a reasonable anti-Christ role and the special effects are somewhat more modern."
1,Where did my previous review go?,"I wrote a review of this a while back and now it seems to be missing. At any rate, stay away from this piece of garbage. Having been a long-term horror fan, it really says something when a guy like me gets grossed out because a movie is about baby after innocent, defenseless baby being killed. And all because they are SUPPOSEDLY the second coming of Christ. Let me ask you this: if you were Christ and you wanted to come back because Damien was the anti-you, would you come back as a creature that was too weak to fend for itself? Of course not!!! You would come back as an adult so you could have at least a 50-50 chance of winning! In other words, the filmmakers made a conscious choice to have babies as the main victims in this movie. Sick, sick, sick!!!!"
1,Yeah... very scary!!!,Oh Yeah. I am sooooooooooo scared to watch this movie alone coz I am just a kid. Barf! And I watched it many times myself that I still cannot remember the story. All I know is: this is the most boring among the three. BORING!
1,The Final Conflict? Thank Goodness!,"So Damien Thorne is all grown up as the son of Satan. He's now ambassador to the UK, and he secretly plots world domination. Too bad the film's a disaster. Where to begin? Sam Neill's cardboard performance as Damien? The utter lack of tension in the story? There is one true scary moment concerning the former ambassador, but otherwise, this film is a colossal waste of time. You're better off watching the superior ""Omen"" 1 & 2 a second time than picking up this stinker."
2,Too tedious,"Although I liked the Omen and it's first sequel, I didn't like this one. Although many saw it as a good completion to the trilogy (which wasn't the case with Omen 4) I grew tired of it. This film relied more on religion than horror. Sam Neill is well cast as Damien as battle of heaven of hell clash but I found it tedious, I couldn't understand the boring storyline of Judgement Day and Christ and the Devil. I never was a religious follower in the first place. The film has a clever plot, but that's all really. It didn't hold my attention for too long."
2,A waste of money,I had no idea that the movie had nudity in it not appropriatefor families with young kids. Also I found the movie to be VERY BORING AS WELL!!!!!!
4,Omen III,"This was a fair sequel to the Omen series. Viewers should not be concerned of the horror aspect since there wasn't much blood and gore. It does establish the principle that good triumphs over evil in the end, and actor Sam Neill does an adequate job in this regard."
4,Maltin Type Review,"A slight tad worse than its two predeccesors, this film involves once devil child Damien Thorn (Sam Niel) thirty-two and ambassador to great Britain. However, unknown to his partner and hypnotized people, he is thwarting a revenge against Jesus. however, he must get rid of the priest's on his tail. This film is nicely entertaining, but SO WIERD! Many things are left hanging. Some (though not many) eerie moments and good acting help what could have been mess. New title: Omen III The Final Conflict. Next, and last, chapter: Omen IV The Awakening. Rated R"
2,"Bad Sequel, Bad Sequel!","The third in the Omen series is only notable for the Jerry Goldsmith score which is a natural extension of the the first two. Obviously, the most expensive cost of the film because this one has no names, not a good script, and the dumbest bunch of monks/priests ever assembled."
2,The Attack of the Keystone Monks,"The third in ""The Omen"" trilogy features the dumbest collection of monks to ever grace the silver screen. Their attempts to do away with the Anti-Christ are so laughable that I thought I was watching a comedy. Sam Neill must have done this to get ""established"" in Hollywood. Thank God for him that better roles were to come. After the first knockout punch of the first two films, this one is a true waste.The only saving grace is the Goldsmith score that single-handedly ""resurrects"" this turkey."
1,Omen 3,"Snooze Fest, Watch Parts 1 and 2 instead, a Lowpoint after the first two. but perhaps not as bad as the 4th installment."
4,Da End..... Of Damien!,"This is the true end of the omen series no including that horrible crap Omen IV. Damien finally meets his makes Jesus Christ and is destroyed. The action is great and the plot was set up well. This should be owened if you are a fan or just collecting the movies, it is really the last sequel."
3,Only Dissapointed,"Firstly i wanna say that, this film is the worst omen film in this series.Not too much action,not too much horror and not too much tension.This film is not to include these things.So i cant see a watchable film in the middle. This film has a few disadvantages.First one is the casts.The cast's r good but scenario's defiencies r crushing their performances in this film. And the second one is places.The places can not give a horror film tune.So that s a very big defiency in a horror film.Only the advantage is;this film carry a big name(OMEN)"
4,It's not THAT bad!!,"I don't know what people are complaining about. The 1st two ""Omen"" films had cheesier music and even cheesier acting than this one. ""The Final Conflict"" is entertaining and Sam Neill does a great job. I would've liked a little more follow-thru at the end of the film, more explainantions- but other than that I have no complaints."
2,Not That Godd,"I was really looking forward to this DVD but it really was a let down. The story of hogan was great but the extra matched were not that good. Mostly all of them were boring, and some didnt even have announcing. Overall this is ok, but I would really think before buying it."
5,Are you a Hulkamanic,This is a great video if you like Hulk Hogan. It is the best to see how he first started out has a wrestler and all of the greatest wrestling matches. This is a must buy with 6 hours of footage.
2,Fluff not Stuff,Just did not have very good matches and was not complete enough. Not very good when you consider the career of Hulk Hogan. Not worth having.
5,The Best,"In this awesome DVD you get to learn about one of the biggest legend to ever come out professional wrestling Hollywood Hulk Hogan. He talks about his wrestling career and certain matches. Plus in the extras you get to witness vintage matches with such greats as Paul Orndorff and Andre The Giant. This DVD is a great buy for anyone who likes wrestlings, or someone wants to know more about the legend Hollywood Hulk Hogan."
4,This is an excellent knife tray.,"This in-drawer knife tray is very functional. It stores most knives, fits nicely in a standard kitchen drawer, and is sturdy. I was unable to find a suitable knife tray at the local department stores. Also, I was pleased with the reasonable price. Thank you, Amazon."
4,Purchased for my Cutco knives.,I purchased this product to store my Cutco branded knives in a drawer. It worked like a charm. The knives are organized and out of sight.
5,Great Product,"I love the way the steak knives snuggle into the upper slots. Same type product at retail stores was not designed for the normal 2"" high drawers. This is perfect fit."
3,The Negatives,"1) Will not hold small knives with larger than Henckels handles (such as Chicago Cuttlery).2) No provision for meat fork.3) Could be a couple inches wider.Other than the above, still a pretty nice item for a person needing more counter than drawer space."
4,A Great Beginning,"This knife block is wonderful for people who are just beginning a collection of good knives. After years with only one or two ""good knives"" in the house we've finally replaced them all with a number of very nice Wusthof Culinar and Japanese ceramic knives...none of which we wanted to have out on the counter in a block! The Henckels 13-Slot In-Drawer Knife Tray is well crafted and all the features it does have are wonderful - the combination of longer and shorter slots, the center slot for a sharpening piece. My only complaints are similar to those already stated: there's no place for shears and there's not enough room for any steak knives if you actually have a decent assortment of regular knives. I definitely recommend this product, but if you have the room and a lot of cutlery buy two!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this knife tray based upon the reviews of others. How disappointed I was in the quality of this product. The tray was put together crooked so that it wouldn't even fit my kitchen drawers. Based upon the amount I paid for this product, it is of extremely poor quality."
2,Low quality - not worth it,"I am very surprised by all the positive reviews. The major problem with this is the quality of the wood and finishing. First, the base is a thin 1/4"" thick plywood to which the solid oak wood is attached. This is not as bad but still looks and feels cheap.Second, is the lack of finishing on the oak wood itself. The top surfaces are all finished but the grooves and cavities where the knife blades and handles go are VERY ROUGH, as if they had been milled or cut with a saw and not ever sanded. I'm not talking fine sanding, i mean not even 80-grit sandpaper used. This is very rough and the wood particles and dust rub against the knives and will contaminate the knives as they fall off and collect on the bottom of the tray.This is very surprising and a major turn off. I sent it back and ordered the Totally Bamboo tray which hopefully is better than this."
2,Cracked and bigger than expected,"It was kind of cracked on the bottom and way bigger than I expected. Also the end piece unglued and I fixed it.I have a smaller one that works better.I ripped it down the center, making 2 of them, so I have one extra."
5,Great knife tray,It's a great tray for keeping knives organized and secure in the drawer. We much prefer it over the wood block on the kitchen counter. We're not a fan of clutter on the counters.
4,A nice alternative to the block on the counter,"I've found this to be a viable solution to knife storage. Of course, that's assuming you have an extra kitchen drawer to spare. After a couple of days I was used to reaching into the drawer to pull out knives, but now I like not having them on the counter.The only negatives I've found about this item is that bigger blades (like my Shun Ken Onion or my Shun Bob Kramer) don't sit far enough down into the slots. The result, in my case, is that the tips of the blades are exposed, resting above the slot, in the back of the drawer. Could be a problem if someone reached into the back of the drawer. Then again, if they're dim enough to do such a thing, they may just deserve the poke they'd receive. Another note: the small slots really only accommodate small blades. My 5"" utility knife doesn't fit, and I don't have any big slot remaining to house it.The tray itself seems very sturdy and solid and I expect it will last for years."
5,Solid,"I bought this for a couple of reasons: I want to clear my counters of unnecessary clutter and the old standing knifeblock was ugly and a magnet for grease and dust. I also like this style better than the other bamboo in-drawer knife block. It has plenty of space, but if it doesn't, you probably have too many knives. (I'm of the school that says you only need 3 or 4 good ones.)"
3,almost perfect for any kitchen,"Product safely stores the knives, but still annoyed by the way smaller knives are stored. The product has grooves for the smaller knives and it securely and easily stores them. It's when you try to take the knives out where the problem arises. You either have to pinch between the two bigger knife blades to access the handle of the smaller knife, or attempt to scoop the knife from the long end of the handle. If the smaller steak knife is full size and fills the grooves, then you really can't put your finger or fingers in there to take the knives out.While this is may not be a problem for occasional knives, the everyday meat lovers will quickly get annoyed by the poor design. I wish I had bought the Wusthof 14 Slot Knife organizer instead."
4,A Good Product For Cramped Kitchens,"This knife organizer works very well for those kitchens, such as mine, with limited counter space. It is very convenient to pull open a drawer and have all of my knives right there at hand, with recessed slots for the steak knives and longer slots for the chopping and paring knives. For larger dining events the holder can be lifted out of the drawer and placed on the counter and still look as if it belongs. My only complaint is that it is made in China."
2,"Style far, far above story.","If you read comics for style, this is your book. If you read them for story, plot, or anything like that, this is not your book.I don't usually look at the art at all, beyond it's use in storytelling. 2 stars."
2,Unsuitable for Macbook Pro,I can only concur with the previous reviewers. I have had the same Macbook Pro sleep problems with this product. Doing some web searching implied that some cards have the same problem and some don't. I was very relieved when I found that this reader was the cause of my Mac's insomnia. I thought I was cursed when the problem followed me from a previous Macbook Pro (where I was using this card reader as well).
1,CAUSED *HOURS* of wasted time!,"I just noticed another reviewer posted a similar issue.MacBook Pro (latest version) will simply not sleep with this card installed.Unfortunately, I did not notice this problem immediately after installing the card, and it was pretty far down on my troubleshooting list. I spend hours eliminating other possibilities before I removed the card and the problem resolved instantly.I previously had an Adata card which did not have this problem, but unfortunately died for other reasons.Overall conclusion: AVOID."
5,Silk Ribbon Embroidery Bible,I couldn't wait to get this book and I just love it. The illustrations are clear and easy to follow. Everything is step by step so it's hard to make a mistake. It also gives a wonderful overview of the different types to ribbon to use and fabrics that work best.I highly recommend this book for the beginner like myself and as an excellent reference book for the experienced.Tina
5,I loved this show when it was new,"And I love it just as much now, it's dated perhaps but then again so am I. Subtle fear coupled with oftentimes cozy settings make for a sense of creeping dread missing in so many big budget theatrical horror releases. The music fits it perfectly and adds to the unnerving atmosphere greatly. My only complaint is that I can't find the other seasons."
1,"Great series, but why do US fans suffer immensely on the price?","When this creepy anthology series first debuted on Region 2 DVD back in 2005, I knew I wanted to eventually purchase it, and it was a great deal in getting all 4 seasons in one boxed set. I never got around to buying it, figuring I would see if it would ever surface on Region 1. Well, it has, and for more money than I can buy all 4 seasons, we only get the first season? ARGH! You'd spend a small fortune collecting these! Since cheap DVD players can easily be changed to multi region these days, for the price you will have to pay to get the entire series on Region 1 discs, you could spend far less buying a new DVD player, the Region 2 boxed set, and still have money left over for a few seasons of some other television show. Ridiculous how we get rooked in the US, and it's a UK show."
3,NOT SUCH A THILL!,"When I bought this I expected more out of it then what I received. First off on the good side of it there are a few good storylines, however all endings no so great. I think that the endings is what made a lot of the stories unsatisfactory. The way I rated this has nothing at all to do with it being English because there are some of the English Shows that I do really enjoy. There were a few stories that I enjoyed up until the endings. I think if the writer would have put a little bit more effort into the endings that it would have made a tremindous difference. Not such of a thrill to me. I do understand that it is also 70's horror but still there were a lot more 70's horror flicks that I enjoyed better then this set. I hate to seem so harsh but it is just not worth the wait when you order it. I was excited to see it come in the mail then let down when I watched it. I hate to keep mentioning this but I really do think that the endings is what ruined the stories."
2,Thriller,"The dvd was very clear to be so old. Times has really changed from the horror movies now from this corny ""horror"" movie back in the day."
3,Missing too much!,"I can't imagine a best of without ""Jealousy"", ""Mandy"" and ""Had Enough"" (even though they are from the same album). This compilation is okay, but I just think that some of the best songs from Mood Swings are missing. What a shame!"
1,Wearisome.,"Noting Hobsbawm having been cited frequently in numerous leftist works read over the years, I duly anticipated perusing ""REVOLUTIONARIES""--only to have same-said anticipation crushed but a few essays into this collection (the essays having been penned in the 1960's and early 1970's). Hobsbawn astounds via his amazing alchemisation of inherently dynamic, human, and inspiring subject matters (e.g., essays entitled, ""May 1968,"" ""Intellectuals and the Class Struggle,"" etc.) into dry, tedious, bloodless ""old school"" academic insipidity! By the fourth or fifth essay--referencing Italian Communism--I was compelled to put my first (and last) Hobsbawm down.Ultimately, with such a wealth of well-written, informative and vibrant books, articles, etc., relative to the material ""REVOLUTIONARIES"" covers readily available, Hobsbawm's work is not commended."
4,"Story is wonderful, Kindle edition has some flaws","It's a great story. And frankly, pretty much ALL the free Kindle books have a few typos.But I'm writing because none of the other reviewers of the Kindle edition seem to have noticed that every bit of poetry or song has been stripped out of this Kindle book. This is a real shame, because there are a great many places in the book where the author quotes a couple lines of poetry by way of giving us an insight into a character's thoughts, and she even used poetry to foreshadow in a few places. Unfortunately readers of the Kindle edition will miss out on these bits.The book still makes perfect sense without the poetry, so for the price you can't complain too much. And it's a fascinating look at early Victorian life, especially the attitudes of the day. But the omission is a bit frustrating."
1,"Trash, not worth a nickel","It shouldn't even be on video or sold anywhere. This junk must have been made by someone on crack, theres an annoying buzzing sound effect for the first half hour that returns through out the movie. There is no storyline at all...not even a little bit of a plot. Not even worth your time if its free.What is even more messed up, I also bought it in the cheapo bin at Wally World and tried to review it on their website and they wouldn't post it. I will never buy movies from them again, I find them cheaper on here anyway.Hey, I noticed someones offering it used for a penny, lol"
1,THE. WORST. MOVIE. EVER!,"I really, really wish i had even read one review before purchasing this movie based on the cover at my local wal mart for 6 bucks. i now see why it was in the cheapo bin. i cannot BELIEVE this movie even got any kind of distribution behind it to even end up at a walmart, but through one of the worst flukes in history it did. i will never have my hour of time back that i wasted fast forwarding through this worthless.. i dont even know what to call it. certainly not anything close to a movie. the acting is HORRIBLE in every aspect, laughable at best. i am disgusted right now. the movie is in the trash can where it belongs. do not let the alluring cover fool you as it did me, I cannot stress this enough it shoudl be a public service announcement, DO NOT COME WITHIN ANY CONTACT. Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE!!!!"
1,Avoid like the plague,"Borderline Cult is yet another attempt to separate you from your money and give you crap. Uli Lommel is one of the two worst directors in modern horror. Hell, the film was shot with a camcorder for Christ's sake. The acting is this film is typical of the -Zgrade actors Uli has in his notorious film cult, The Cult of Uli, as the horror industry knows it as. Most notably is the lack luster performance by the female pycho killer, played by that no talent actress Elissa Dowling...In the name of your good sense and to keep you from vomitting up your popcorn, avoid this film like the plague....it is total crap!!!!"
1,Zero stars please,"My daughter told me NOT to rent this just based on the cover alone (and she's a horror movie junkie). I should've listened. I think I got 5 min. into it then started fast-forwarding it for the 1st death scene & now I'm in here on the computer seeing if everyone else thinks it is awful & lo & behold they agree!!! Thank God I only wasted 50 cents on it. I'm not even gonna bother watching the rest. Oh yeah, it has spanish subtitles that are running under my closed captions so that is annoying!"
3,More acurate information is needed in this transaction,"First of all the customer service at Amamzon is very good, but their online information about shipping times is very inconsistent. I ordered the book with expediated shipping that said I would recieve the book in 4-7 business days then they send me a confirmation letter saying I would receive the book in 14 business days this wasn't good for me I needed the book for a graduate course I am taking. I complained and Amazon apologized and gave me a 5$ credit on my next purchase then the book shows up on time in 4 business days. So to me there shipping policy and time quotes should be more consistent."
4,I'm happy with mine,"This is my first CD recorder. I bought it because my tape deck is worn out. I'm now busy copying some of my favorite vinyl and tapes to CD. I'm using only the audio connections; it also has digital connections. Despite what the manual implies, the playback-only deck plays (finalized) CD-RW disks as well as commercial CDs and CD-R disks. This allows me to make trial disks on a CD-RW and then duplicate the final results to a CD-R. If I want the final CD-R can be in a different track order from the CD-RW. It also provides the capability of playing Deck A, then Deck B (it's called ""Relay Play""). I saw some recorders which had separate outputs for the two decks; I didn't want that.One thing I wish Sony (as well as some other manufacturers) would do is to make their owners manuals available online for download. This would enable people who were shopping online to see the manual before they buy. I'm glad to say it contained no unpleasant surprises."
4,Nice camera backpack,Very good camera backpack with lots of space to caryy camera and it's accessories.But the laptop compartment looks to be small for 15.4 inch and very tight. one more drawback is we can not keep the manuals and laptop together.
5,"Such a thought provoking, wisdom filled book","The book is almost like just alot of essays, or short stories. Levi describes some of the relationships and incidents that he recalls from his time in the camp. Very compelling reading, sort of like a human study of emotions."
4,Excellent,These CDs have a great mix of bands that supply a long and fun new listen for most anyone that hasn't heard all of these bands less known songs. Not to say that these songs are at all bad though a definite good buy ;)
4,Strike and Hold: A Memoir of the 82nd Airborne in World War II,"I purchased this book as a gift for the grandniece of an airman who was a member of this unit. He died in Italy before she was born, but both she and her husband are very interested in both American military history, and family history. They have both read the book and have related to me their pleasure in the reading of this book, and the feeling of shared experiences with their gr-uncle and all the members of the 82nd Airborne in WW II. Thank you Mr. Burriss.(The only reason I did not rate this book five stars is because I have not personally read the book.)"
5,Wonderful Book!,"There are a lot of details and stories in this book that I have not found anywhere else. I really enjoyed the personal touches. The additional perspectives from other paratroopers was appreciated.My uncle (S/Sgt David ""Rosie"" Rosenkrantz, MIA 9/28/44 Holland) was in H Company, 504. He was in some of the same battles and it sounds like they fought side-by-side at times."
1,Defectively sized,"Agree with the first reviewer. On the bras I received, it was the bra's band that was at least half the size it should've been. Would've fit around my thigh, not my rib cage. Its amazing that these ever left the factory. Helloooo quality control?"
1,A Truly Waste of Money,"If you are looking for a good source for quotations stay away from the ""Pop-up Oxford Dictionary of Quotations"" - shame on Oxford for allowing their prestigious name to be placed on such a terrible program. The first thing that bothered me was that the print displayed on the monitor is tiny and the software cannot be corrected for the impediment. Second, you must simply have 20/20 eyesight or accustom yourself to using a magnifying glass while you use this program. Third, after you take out the magnifier or strain your eyes, you can read either the error messages or the software's lack of sufficient quotations. I did not wait for the fourth reason - I uninstalled the software. I would not waste or through away money on this program - I'm sorry I did."
2,Not very good.,"The film has some good Irving Berlin songs and some dreadful ones. The movie is garish and overproduced. Ethel Merman is the best thing about this film. She was a great Broadway star, a great singer, and a good actress. Marilyn Monroe just sleepwalks through this movie. Her delivery of the lines is dull and her singing is duller. She looks like she wants to be somewhere else. Donald O'Connor is unusually annoying in this film. He looks bored as well. Johnny Ray is miscast. And Dan Dailey isn't his usual interesting self in this movie. The only performers who save this film are Ethel Merman and Mitzi Gaynor. My verdict: too much Monroe and O'Connor and not enough Merman."
4,Donald O'Connor and Marilyn Monroe shine,"The original trailer shouts, ""Follow the lives of the folks behind the footlights ... their lives! Their loves! Their sorrows!"" You won't be disappointed. This musical takes you through the ups and bumps of a show business family (the Donahues). From the challenges of mixing Vaudeville with child- raising to the complexities of rocky shoals adolescence common to every family, you'll be glad to share the Donahues' story. There's plenty of joy and outstanding hold-your-breath musical numbers, too (with music by Irving Berlin). Plus, it's a rare treat to see American cinematic treasures Donald O'Connor and Marilyn Monroe share the screen. Although the first half of the movie is a little slow, the second half more than makes up for it. The original trailer is the best extra feature of the DVD. Otherwise, the video is just as good."
3,OYVEY THIS FILM IS HoKEY AND FUNNY,"OK a little history about this film. Marilyn Monroe had to make this film in order to go and then do The Seven Year Itch. Her costars Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey and evn Mitzy Gaynor report her being colod and aloof on the set. Marilyn was caught in an ubhaapy mariiage to Joe Dimaggio. She had not made a film in almost a year and on top of that she was playing yet again the gold digging blonde, and she was not a naturally born singer and dancer. However I think that she comes off the best in this film because of her absolute love affair iwh the camera. Hands down After y6ou get what you want You don't want it is a great number. AsIs Lazy with Mitzi Gaynor and Doold O' conner. Her acting is wooden, but so is eveyone else's in this film. Johnny Ray as priest!!! Yet, I have to say entertaining and fun to watch"
2,Pass on this one,"Where do I begin? First of all the story line was weak. The movie seemed to drag on forever. I breathed a heavy sigh of relief when it was finally over. Seriously, how many different versions of Alexander's Ragtime Band can a person listen to in a single movie and not go insane?Now for the good parts. The costumes were gorgeous. The dancers were very talented. They made complicated steps appear effortless.Overall, the movie was over the top during the musical numbers and weak during the non musical scenes. The contrast was almost too much to bear. There are many other musicals that balance the two, but not this one."
3,"Has it's moments, but mostly DULLSVILLE","Of all the Marilyn Monroe DVDs I've seen (about 7) this was the only one I didn't take to. Of course when Marilyn's on the screen, it's great, but the rest of the time I found it to be forced and Ethel Merman just seemed annoying. The family was dullsville and I never want to see it again! It wasn't awful, just not worthy of Marilyn."
4,It's the Five Donahues..............,"Ok Ok. I have been a lifelong Marilyn Monroe fan since childhood, I love her. But when you are a Marilyn fan you have to put up with hit and miss movies. No Business is one of them. When Marilyn is on the screen singing and dancing, the movie is all hers. Who doesn't love the Heat Wave number? The rest of the movie is a drag and unless you are a huge Ethyl Merman fan (?) this film doesn't have much to offer.This is a musical with a very light plot; the story of the Donahue Family in show business. The two sons grow up to be a couple of dorks. The one who wants to be a priest is just scary. He acts like a Peter O'Tool derelict with a murderous smile. The other one is driven over the edge by Marilyn's lack of interest and joins the Navy.Like I said, if you are a Marilyn fan, there are scenes in this film that you must have. If youare not a Marilyn fan, well you got Ethyl and Berlin music."
4,"Lousy story, great production number.","A plot that has Johnny Ray playing a priest torn between his vows and his bows--and it only gets worse from there. But some of the production numbers are deliciously extravagant even by Hollywood standards. The ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" montage--a musical workout that incorporates a variety of musical styles and ethnic costumery and dance--is easily worth the price of admission all by itself. It alone testifies to Berlin's importance to American music and consequently to the universe. (But as a fan of Marilyn Monroe, I must say her performance is not indispensable viewing.) For a more aesthetically satisfying tribute to Irvin Berlin, check out the movie entitled ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" starring Tyrone Power and Alice Faye--or, for that matter, ""Top Hat"" with Fred and Ginger."
5,BUSINESS,GREAT PRICE GREAT MOVIE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THE GOOD OLD MOVIES TO FALL BACK ON AND SHOW YOUR CHILDREN.
5,Enjoyable Nostalgia,An exciting musical with a cast the type that would be impossible to put together in the same film. The same old story but well presented.
2,Times change,"This is my first book by Anne Rivers Siddons. I must say she has a fine way with words and story-telling. However, I expect this group of stories played better in 1975 than it does today. Siddons portrays herself as awfully childish in almost every essay, crying buckets of tears and fretting over the most superficial aspects of life. If you like the modern-day southern belle genre, you might enjoy this, but if you like your women a little gutsier, steer clear."
5,Must have,"This book is a must have for anyone critical of the development discourse. Heavy texts from around forty different progressive scholars are accompanied by boxes with excerpts from even more, such radical thinkers and activists. Refreshing and almost invaluable!"
4,Best of Post-development Perspectives,"This is an excellent collection of papers by the best known scholars in the tradition of Post-development perspective. It examines critically most of the key conceptual categories of mainstream developmentalism. Various papers also demonstrate how the radical elements of 'alternative development' are coopted by mainstream developmentalism and therefore end up rejecting altogether the idea of development. A clear statement of the perspective of Post-development also helps its critics who, while critical of many aspects of mainstream developmentalism, refuse to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater'. Thus The Post-Development Reader is an extremely useful contribution to the literature on development at a time when there is tremendous confusion in development discourses which use the same terms to state very different ideas."
4,neat feferencebook,"a matter of curiosity, a good book that should be in everybody's bookcase good reference."
5,WORDS MOST OFTEN MISSPELLED AND MISPRONOUNCED,"THE BOOK WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND IT CAME IN TWO DAYS. I WAS A ""HAPPY CAMPER"""
5,Tchiakowvsky - Swan Lake (Paris Ballet),This version of Swan Lake is choregraphed by Rudolph Nureyev and is classical ballet at its best. The soloists dance with precision and have a beautiful presence. The corps de ballet dance are breath-takingly beautiful -- the choreography is exquisite. The camera angles also bring out the excitement and passion of this ballet. It's as if we are seeing the shape of the soul of Swan Lake through the ballet.
4,A beautiful performance overall!,"This performance of the Paris Opera is very beautiful and elegant. While the lack of emotion by Jose and Agnes does detract some from the performance, their dancing is graceful, soft, and beautiful. With more emotion, I would've given this an extra star. Don't let this keep you from buying this dvd. I changed my review of this performance. In the beginning, I didn't like the camara work. It has really grown on me. The camara really captures the patterns and lighting which contributes to the mood of this performance. The picture quality, sound, lighting, and performance make this a stunningly beautiful presentation."
4,blow blow,"if you are fans of fred wesley and maceo parker i recommend this, not the best p-funk recording but damn sure not the worst."
3,maceo won't you blow,"to keep things short, this cd is worth a listen only to funklovers who love the legendary talents of fred wesley, and maceo parker."
1,kd tools,"i recieved two of these kits, and both of them were missing the same piece. i have returned both of them and have yet to see any kind of credit."
4,Nice puller,"I used this tool for the first time today. I used it on a Ford power steering pump. It worked well on removing the pulley and installing it. When using this, or any other threaded tool, be sure to grease the threads and inserts that push on the shaft and never use and impact tool. Recommended"
4,A phenomenal album,"This is a really unique and strong album, really breaks through to a new level on some songs, especially title cut. However i don't give it a ""5 star"" rating because some of the songs seem to me like filler material..."
2,Excellent Playing but....,"I have liked almost everything I have heard from BH and the playing on this one is still excellent. But way too much of this is just not bluegrass, its radio friendly country. Very commercial. Tears Fell on Missouri for example sounds like a standard breakup/heartbreak song from Clint Black or Garth Brooks - not bluegrass. I found myself listening for the great playing and wishing the singer would just shut up. If they were singing some good bluegrass, I wouldn't have that problem. The one instrumental is good, but I wish they would have given alot more room for some hot playing instead of the smooth dull singing. Some people have rated this high and like this one, but not me - I sold mine. Listen to the samples. If you like those, it would be a fairly safe bet you would like the cd. If not, try almost any other BH release."
5,Great fan,I bought this fan to move air in the back of a retail space. It it pretty quiet - and has 3 settings so you can adjust as needed. I really like the adjustable vents - it allows me to place the fan on the floor but direct the air upwards and to the side.
1,Deceptive advertising,"I ordered this fan thinking it was white. It is not. It is mint green. After receiving the fan, I contacted Supentown customer service. It is Supentown's position that the ad clearly shows it to be green and nowhere in the ad does it say the fan is white. Unbelievable! How about nowhere does it say it's green? Caveat emptor!!!"
5,Great Knife,I have never spent this much on a knife before. It was much lighter than I expected. Compared to the other knives that I have this one is amazing! It is very well made.
2,No progress from this item,"I order this item and I have not seen any results from using it at night. It suppose to help your eyebrow and lashes grow, but I am only using for my eyebrow. I have been using it now for about three weeks. I will not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Adventure and storytelling at its best.,"Having visited Russia shortly after Communism fell, I became intrigued with its people and its culture. This book, written shortly before the fall of Communism, captures a unique period of time in the history of this country that will never again be repeated. There is the obvious socio-political observations -- which from my perspective of having been there were dead on target -- but also adventure and stories rich with characters and emotions and pathos. Every chapter takes you into a new set of characters and a new story. Sort of reminded me of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn in that way. A very enjoyable read"
3,A record not made in a country not liked,"Mark Jenkins clearly did not like Russia and the system. I agree on his view of the old system, but my thoughts were again and again: What does he do there. He don't like it at all. In spite of all the trouble of Mark Jenkins, the fact is that a Russian biker crossed Russia one sea to another in 1967, 22 years before Jenkins. The first do cross all of Russia was a Dane, me, who did it in 1997 from Magadan to Kaleningrad (more to the East and more to the West than Jenkins route). The brother of Fjordor Koinikov (who followed Jenkins), Nikolai, tried to do it before me. He failed because of cold. I succeed because I loved Siberia. Jenkins hated it."
1,I Did not find this book entertaining at all.,"Seems like the author is trying to pretend to be this geat hero riding his iron stallion across the frozen reaches of Siberia.I found him to be a true bore. Out running and out smarting Soviet KGB agents on a bicycle? Oh please!If you want to read a true adventure, read Miles From Nowhere by the late Barbara Savage."
