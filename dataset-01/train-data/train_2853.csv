3,Poor plastic quality,"This is the 3rd time I have ordered this item. There has always been a crack on the inside plunger. I will be keeping this item since there is not a hole in it this time and I can't find a similar product. However, I am disappointed in the packaging of this item as it is not good for keeping all of the pieces together. And it does not look like the picture shown on the store site."
1,disappointed,Disappointed. Hard to use. Writing was almost impossible. Not a smooth flow at all. Make a practice project before using for something important.
1,not useable,"the plunger used to push the iceing thru the tip, fit to tight to be able to push out and decorate with out useing both hands. i just could not use it!!!!"
4,Interesting book,"This is a fascinating book full of wonderful photos as well as interesting text that chronicles the development and evolution of most of the modern airliners in our skies today, as well as also covering many of the older planes no longer flown.In addition to covering many of the well known planes, it also has sections on fascinating planes that never made it to commercial release (such as the Bristol Brabazon).The only complaint I have, and the reason for four rather than five stars, is that while Mellberg's book is excellent, it is far from complete, and its slim 220 or so pages (almost one half being photos) could easily double or triple in size by adding more complete coverage and of more planes.Let's hope that the author is working on a second volume! :)"
3,reversing ratchet wrench set,"pros-shipped very fastcons-the wrench set i received was not the one pictured in the ad. this is a different model with the reversing mechanism on top instead of the side. i can use them but, having paid full price i expected to get what i saw in the ad? buy with caution and expect apples when you pay for oranges!"
5,She's the best,"Penelope Leach is the most sensible, pragmatic and intelligent of child care ""experts,"" with empathies that are clearly with the child in this argument that the developed world must make it easier for families to put their children first."
4,For the Child (In all of us),"A pleasant and affirmative guide for newborns and for new parents - stressing the value and meaning of words as sounds and messages.The prose herein can be read to a young child even if that young child cannot comprehend all the statements. Expressions of ""joy"", ""respect"", ""patience"", will ring true at some point in the child's development.Reading-to-your-child is really a lost Art. This writer is determined to reclaim it!"
5,Great Memories!,"I loved Soul Train...the show with Don Cornelius...great dancing,I learned some ""moves"" there! Good music! To me, music then was ""fun""...today its very serious or violent...then it was ""fun"", ""light"" and ""danceable""...No rap here, just gooddance music that takes me back! A must-have for anyone lovingthe era and the show! Regina"
3,An ok watch,"I like it fine and haven't had any problems with it, but it's not as classy looking as I expected."
2,Works....BUT....PLEASE READ!,The reviews were good on this product so I chose this ear mite medicine for my cats & dogs. It says it kills mites instantly on contact..BUT... all my animals needed 2-3 doses total over a few weeks time. This medicine is very dangerous & can make your pets very ill. All my guys had negative reactions to this product. It's not worth it!! Look for something else...
4,Effective and soothing for pets,"I have been using this product for a while, It does not sting and works effectively. Be careful not to overuse as these chemicals are to be treated with care."
1,NOT PEEL OFF OR STICKER,I love them... They are so cute.. but I AM SO DISAPPOINTED that they are not peel off or sticker.I had to return them back!
3,His Shakespeare criticism is more interesting,"Not as interesting as his work about Shakespeare, but worth reading for the section about the use of words and good poetry, which really would be the reason to read it."
2,Where is the track list ??,Cannot provide a review as there is no track listing ??Please provide the track listing and artists featured on this compilation
5,"Easy to Follow, Fun to Read","After searching the shelves for a bar guide, my husband and I finally decided to get The Ultimate A-To-Z Bar Guide because it was fun and interesting to read. Its content is comprehensive--everything one would ever want to make is in this book. And the layout/format is simple: look up drinks based on ingredients, alphabetically, or even by type. And the prose is entertaining as well! The introduction packs a lot of useful information for the beginning entertainer, like what glasses to use and basic liquor knowledge. We're glad we picked this one."
5,Full featured and interactive,"This CD-ROM is very cool. It is pretty rudimentary, but if you are learning or refreshing your knowledge of reading music, this is a painless and fun way to do it. It also has tabulature (?), or pictures and descriptions of where to play the notes if you don't want to learn musical notation. Also, you can set the tempo of the sections you play along with, as well as mute any combination of 4 tracks, such as metronome, guitar (example), accompaniment, and (?) rythm section. Graphics are clear and show where on the neck, what fret and what string to play. There's also a ""tuner"" which plays the notes needed to tune your guitar. Sound quality in general, and of the tuner is fine."
3,A Second Tier Time Travel Novel,"The premise of ""Time After Time"" is that H.G. Wells successfully invented a time machine that is stolen by Jack the Ripper. The murderer uses the machine to land in San Francisco in 1979. Wells feels responsible for the murderer's escape from London and follows him with the intention of returning ""Jack"" to 1893.This sounds like it has the makings of a great novel, but I found it to be slow-moving, predictable, and filled with time travel clich√©s. ""Time After Time"" is okay, but for a more interesting time travel novel check out ""Replay,"" ""The 13th Hour"" or Jack Finney's ""Time and Again."""
5,Bjork gone Canada,"Both this album and Heroine are excellent. The instrumention, sound and mix are something like Bjork - modern, clever, sophisticated - but where Bjork would go operatic, the Wild Strawberries have gone '60s black-girl electro-pop. A lot of quirky character in the music and a lot of fun. A truly great electro-pop band."
4,The best in grow-your-own decorations,"There is nothing like the anticipation of waiting for the chia seeds to sprout. Once they do all you want to do is check on the growth every hour, and turn the sprouts into the sun, ensuring equitable growth. For two weeks you have the pleasure of creation as your chia pet grows on sunlight and water. Yet the end comes, and you have to sneak off in the night to scrape the overgrown little plants into the garbage and hope no one asks about the little pet the next day. This is a sad day, but will only open itself into another chance for the cycle to begin again, and you anticipate the sprouting of your chia seeds."
4,Brings Back Memories,"I loved Chia pets when I was a kid and have enjoyed getting to relive the experience of having one with my kids. We have been watching the puppy grow his ""coat"" out. They are looking forward to giving him his first hair cut. :) Everything you need comes in the box and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. You will have plenty of extra seeds left over in the packet for reuse."
2,"Sloppy, redundant, although some good info","I was extremely disappointed by this hornbook. I was hoping that this would go along with Rotunda's casebook nicely, but I was sorely mistaken. I am really surprised this book was published by Thompson/West. It is sloppy, riddled with errors, and covers topics and cases several times unnecessarily. I did benefit from some of the analysis of the cases, but on the whole, I would definitely not recommend it to anyone."
3,two wrongs don't make a right,You guys sent me the wrong book. I had to par more for it at the campus bookstore cuz i needed it right away! you take too long to ship!
3,Language from the body,"I gave this 3 stars because some of the research felt like it was lacking, overall good book but check that the facts presented are supported by others."
3,"Great, but get it from Target for half the price","These are a lot of fun for both my 2.5 year old and my 6 year old. They both enjoy taking them apart and putting them back together, including mixing and matching different parts. The wheels are little less durable than the other parts.The big issue is the price on Amazon (via Fat Brain Toys). You can find these same cars at Target for about half the price."
5,Great toy!,"This toy is durable, challenging and fun. Helps kids with puzzle-solving and dexterity. Also adding to one's collection increases creativity. Highly recommended."
3,Not as interesting as I thought,"I got this for my son's 5th birthday, and even though I thought they were cool, his interest was average, at best. He loves cars and he did spend dedicated time playing with it, but he lost interest a little faster than with other toys. It wasn't one of his favorites. As an educational toy, I don't see any big benefit. Maybe he was too old for it?"
4,Good but has a big flaw,"Here is a good CD that contains some of the most memorable songs of a very good era in American Dance Music history. So many of the songs here just totally define the disco era. However, some of the cuts here, including ""Play that Funky Music"" and ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" aren't the full versions of the songs. But you'll probably never find the Lou Rawls song anywhere else, so you might as well settle for it."
2,bad translation,"I don't recommend this book. Ther are so many omissions and mistranslations, in addition transformations by Judeo-Christians' biases. For example, Mr. Mitamura never used the word like ""perversion"" ""perverts"" or ""perverted sex"", he just wrote nanshoku(male/male love), male-boy lovers, or male/male sex. If possible, I recommend to read his original book written in easy Japanese, and much more precise in detail, in addition very cheap"
2,The structure,"Upon reading the book ""Chinese Eunuchs The Structure of Intimate Politics"", by Mr. Taisuke Mitamura, i found the structure to be very unorganized and at times, hard to follow. Given, the book starts off well, with vivid descriptions of what a eunuch was and how they became eunuchs, but in the later chapters the book, (or at least i felt) went off tangent. What i mean is that it began to describe the roles of ""fearsome wives"" and then into the ""Yellow Age"". Maybe i missed the essence (albeit i read the book very quickly) but i thought the focus was in the role of eunuchs in intimate politics."
2,Bloodless,"The sensational Romanian Gypsy group Taraf de Haidouks has justifiably become one of the hottest attractions on the world music circuit, so somebody must have had the idea of capitalizing on their celebrity by getting them to do ""re-gypsified"" versions of classical compositions derived from Rom sources.The idea definitely does not work. Here we have new arrangements of works by Bartok, Khachatourian and others that just squeeze the vitality out of them. I hope never again to hear so pathetically bloodless a version of Falla's Ritual Fire Dance. A saving grace is that about a third of the disc is the group doing its own thing. But most of these selections can be found on other albums, so if you're a Taraf de Haidouks fan, forget this."
2,Not comfortable,I found these to be very uncomfortable and took up a lot of room in my shoe. I would not purchase this item again.
5,1998 BMW Z3,I bought this part to replace the one on the front hood and it looks great. It was very easy to install and is a great product. If I ever need to replace another I will definitely look for this seller.
1,This is not OEM roundel,"Simple review, the description is false. It is a cheap plastic knock off and not a genuine BMW replacement part"
4,A Nice Sport Shoe,"This is a great climbing shoe for most sport climbing. It edges pretty well and forms nicely to your foot. They smear like no other shoe. But be sure to get them small because they stretch a fair bit. They are a pretty ""soft"" shoe as climbing shoes go, in that they mold more to your foot and you will get a good feel of the rock. These shoes would be awful for crack climbing since they are so soft, so don't even try them for that purpose.The Anasazi velcro is my personal favorite shoe from five ten because it is lined (won't stretch much, if at all) and it is a bit of a stiffer shoe. If you are checking out the moccasyms seriously, also check out la sportiva cobras, which are comparable and i was also very pleased with them."
1,Richard Strauss Conducts,This CD is horrible. The music is good but the sound quality is so bad. Could not be used for anything. Too much noise.
2,Not too clear,"This book provides a wealth of clinical examples of EMDR, but doesn't provide any information about what EMDR is or any understanding about how it works. The author admits that she is ""not trained as a cognitive-behaviorist"" and thus rationalizes her lack of explanation of the theory of EMDR. The author is also an EMDR trainer, which calls into question her choice of case studies. EMDR is a patented method (as the little ""r's in a circle"" keep reminding us) and it would seem that the author thus has a conflict of interest in selecting which case histories are described. The cases are presented in a gee whiz style that undercuts any sense of objectivity, and as a consequence, the books ends up sounding like a long info-mercial. Too bad, because EMDR is an interesting therapy, but may benefit from a more objective approach than what is given here."
4,Better than Others,"I read several books on this topic and found this to be the most scientific and includes a lot more references. Other books tended to have more personal, anecdotal stories."
4,Explains How regression therapy works for healing old trauma?,"This is about the details of new psychotherapy of regressing & releasing old traumatic (PTSD) that suffers millions of us hurt by abuse, accidents, rape, suicide, beating, birth trauma, etc. It very mysterious how remembering old hurt & terrors can be healed by recalling them & flickering eye movements is explained clearly. Its psychotherapy language take adjusting till we can maybe believe it can work. I've heard several interviews on C2Cam of EMDR therapists & damaged peoples healing stories. Reminds me of but very different than ""Primal Scream therapy, 'Past-life regression', & 'Matrix Energetics"" & other subconscious therapies to release old bad horrors, even past life abuses, death & dying, etc.Matrix Energetics: The Science and Art of TransformationThe New Primal Scream: Primal Therapy 20 Years On (Abacus Books)Celebration of Breath: Rebirthing, Book II; Or How to Survive Anything and Heal Your Body"
4,I am Happy,"Got this to upgrade my laptops ""G"". Not quite the range I was hoping for but I am going thru 4 walls. It gets up to 130 MBPS not the 300. For more convient moving my laptop around the the wired USB upgrade I tried before"
4,Remixes still have the same powerful effect and sound of SP,"Even though it only has a few songs, it still has the awesome sound of SP and the fact that they are remixes isn't a bad thing- the songs are wonderfully the same and different."
1,This should be classified as fiction ...,Too bad somebody took great material and used it to activate their own political elitism and try to dumb down others. However the graphics and the production is well done and somewhat entertaining. They did a great job putting this together.
4,A different type of read,"This book reads at times like a hagiography of Jaco. Yeah, Jaco's flaws are enumerated, but there is an obvious worship of Jaco by the author. Having said that, it is still a good book. It is a very thorough biography. It is a little different, in that it helps to have a knowledge of the intricacies of music, e.g., specific chord changes are mentioned. Yo, I took piano, so I don't know a D chord from a G chord on a guitar. Still, I enjoyed the book and learned a lot.The 40 minute CD that comes with the book, is a real nice bonus by the author. Thanks."
4,Good book,"For my first bio book on Jaco I found it very informative both positive and negative aspects of his life. Fascinating story. As a bass-player I would have liked more detail on how he learned to play and his practice methods. These subjects are covered, but not in great detail."
2,Kindle version is not the latest,"I read excerpts of this book online and immediately purchased the Kindle version. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is the first version of the book. At least in the excerpts, there seem to be quite a few improvements and greater detail in the second version (as I would expect from the author's foreword) - lots more interviews and a greater emphasis on Jaco's earlier development and career when he was straight.I'm giving two stars because I'm disappointed that the Kindle version isn't what was advertised, and I think the revised book version is superior."
3,Sangean MMR-77 Emergency AM-FM Portable Radio,"I bought 2 of these in July 2006. We listen to morning and evening news and some talk show programs in the evening. After about 6-8 months, the on/off, turn on/volume knob failed to work correctly. With barely a turn, it's blaringly loud - it's almost impossible to get it at EXACTLY the right spot where it will stay in the range where we can hear it. It ends up being too low or too loud."
2,Nice radio but very old technology,"I bought this crank radio just three months ago. It is a nice product and the radio receiver is of good quality comparing with the price. Unfortunately if you read carefully the User Manual it says that the crank works only up to 100 (one hundred) times. After that the Lithium battery is already exhausted. And in fact in less than a month the rechargeable battery was unusable! This is a very old technology, everyone knows that Lithium batteries cannot be recharged partially and this is what happen with the crank unless you want to spend 10 minutes rotating the crank everyday!!! The manufacturer should replace Lithium batteries with SUPERCAPS."
4,Works as advertised,"As a backup radio to keep in touch with OES and FEMA alerts during catastrophes this is ideal. It's multiple electrical power sources are perfect for long recovery periods when batteries are apt to go bad. Finally, the controls and such are intuitive; so there is virtually no learning curve...the last thing we would want during a recovery period is to have to learn how to turn on and tune the radio."
3,Dynamo Power Disappointing,"This sounded like such a great idea, and the first time I cranked up the dynamo (for about 6 minutes) the charge lasted for many hours. After the initial charge I haven't been able to run it on dynamo power for more than a couple of minutes before it runs down, no matter how much ""cranking"". Nice radio, good sound and reception, but I paid the extra money for the recharge capability."
5,Really Impressed,"I was very surprised by the quality construction and sound of this radio. I'd bought a Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio on Amazon a couple years ago because I just needed a cheap radio to have in the bathroom. But it was cheap in both sound and in the tuning (the frequency adjustment was way off from the actual by several increments).So I did a lot of looking around. I rely a lot on customer reviews and the Sangean MMR-77 Emergency AM/FM Portable Radio had some of the best. I didn't need an emergency radio but the crank is nice to have (bonus!) as was the small flashlight (bonus 2!) I haven't tried the hand crank yet, so I can't attest, but will update my review later.The best thing is the sound. Really good quality in such a small radio. And you can hook it up to computer speakers and get stereo sound (bonus 3!). So, I'll reiterate: good quality for a good price. Very pleased."
4,Helpful in blackouts,I really like this little radio. My only problem with it is that it doesn't pull stations in like I thought it would - but maybe I'm expecting too much. It's great during winter storms when the lights go out - so that I don't feel so isolated.
3,lasted about a week,"I was sure looking forward to having a small radio to carry around while doing yard work, and this one filled the bill for about a week. It suddenly quit -- the light and tuning dial still worked, but no sound. I have returned it for a replacement (I was pleased to find how relatively hassle-free Amazon's return policy is) and will update the review when I've used the new one for a while.Aug 29 2012. I've had the replacement radio for about a month and it's still working, so it lasted longer than the first one."
5,Very Simple and Easy to link up,The instructions made this task of linking up the remote to an existing garage door opener very simple and easy to do.
3,You pay a higher price and they send you something that cost 10 dollars less ?,"The product itself is fine, but I just wonder when you purchase something that cost 24 dollars and change and they send you a different item that is a substitute and it only cost 14 and some change why don't they send you a refund for the difference? I am not sure why this is legal. You should get what you originally ordered or an explanation of why they substituted and they should credit your method of payment for the difference in cost. I don't know how they can do that without adjusting the difference in cost. What is up with that?GIT-1(G2T-1-updated model number) Genie Intellicode Remote(1995-CURRENT)this is what I ordered and this is what they sentGenie Intellicode Gitr-3 Remote Replaces Git-1, Git-2 & Git-3So where is my money?"
5,Incredible customer service & product,"We just moved into a home and the previous owners apparently took the Genie remote garage opener with them. I went on Amazon's web site and found a supplier of the GIT-1 Genie. They were the most helpful, even enjoyable people to talk to in getting this product. Shipping was fast. They advised me that if I had difficulty programing both in my car and the remote, just call they would be most happy to walk me thru. They are worth the 5 stars."
4,excellent product,"it is a good addition to your garage door opener but it may require some programing, if you don't know remote programing or do not have a friend that does, you are toast"
3,A updated version replaces this discontinued item,"The new 3 button version was sent to me as the old one button remote is discontinued. It works but stubborn as hell to accept the new code, keep trying and try all 3 buttons. works OK when finally programmed."
1,Genie door opener,"The case did not close tight enough to make the battery work. I even tried taping it, but still would not work."
1,Extremely Disappointed in Kindle Version (Page Number Issue),"There is a fatal flaw in the Kindle version of this book. There is no way ( I have searched ) to get the hardcopy-version page numbers to show up. On my iPad, it shows the book has 13090 ""pages"" of what is formatted to fit on the screen. I am using this for a college class, so when the professor references a hardcopy page number, I have no idea where he is in reference to my version. This makes this version a pain to use. Often I just give up on trying to literally get on the same page as the professor.I am using another Kindle textbook this semester and it has page numbers and is great. Comparing the two description pages, it looks like if it does not say ""This Kindle book looks just like the printed book"" you may have issues like I do.Bottom Line: If you need page numbers for reference, skip this version."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","Did I tell you the book was boring?The authors spend too much time providing the ""how to"" on developing paperwork (paper-tiger) security programs and nothing on the implementation of real security measures.They borrow whole chapters out of books written by some guy -- Charles Cresson Wood -- heck, just buy that guy's book instead.They introduce each chapter with a cursory view of ""the threat"" yet spend no time explaining how it applies to the chapter.They do ensure that the reader understands the importance of ""making sure your CISO is high enough up the management chain to be effective."" Chapter after chapter after chapter!!!!I've seen better strategic planning in a comic book."
1,"Common sense information, very boring.",This is a very boring book. They didnt bring any new information. basicaly they are talking about information security and why information security is important. well all in IT fields know why InfoSec is very important!!!
5,Excellent!,"This was an excellent textbook and an easy read cover-to-cover. I work in an IA position for the federal government and many of the topics covered in this book were 100% relevant to things I've experienced on the job. I have only a couple of gripes about the book. First, some of the information is a bit dated, even though the book was just published 2.5 years ago. Time for an update. Second, this physical construction of the book is poor. The pages were separating from the binding with the slightest pull! Others in my class complained about the same thing.Over all though, this book was perfect. Many of the concepts align perfectly with things an IA professional would need to know for passing the CISSP exam. Highly recommended textbook!"
4,Great management handbook,"This text book is a great starter manual for people looking to enter the field of IT Security Management. It's well written, and gives a nice overview of the requirements of a Security Manager."
3,THE DORSEYS IN SUPPORT OF POP SINGERS,"This album focuses on the Dorsey Brothers' early pop recordings, particularly those recordings which featured singers. A few of the singers are decent, but most are rather dated. Among the enjoyable singers are Bing Crosby (one tune) and his brother Bob Crosby (numerous tunes). Bob Crosby actually had a nice voice, and it was very similar to Bing's in the upper registers, if nowhere near as perfect. There are also a couple of tracks which give a tiny glimpse of the exhilarating hot small-group jazz the Dorseys were forging at this time, but in the end this compilation basically gives us ensemble based pop music with the Dorseys in a supporting role.This would be charming music for sipping scotch in some antique bar, but for pure listening pleasure, with the accent on hot jazz and the best instrumentalists of the day, folks should check out ""The Fabulous Dorseys"" disc on Living Era/ASV."
2,It's not like the first,"When i bought the second album i was sure it will be at least like the first album, big mistake. I think when Vonda and the rest of people thought in a new album, they did a vonda shepard album, and not an Ally Mc Beal one, so it's not the same. The title of this is ""the new songs from Ally ..."" AND IT'S NOT TRUE, there are only three or four songs that usually appear on the TV, the rest ... well, I don't like them, specially ""To sir, with love"" it's horrible. I don't know if I will buy the third part, Vonda and the rest of people have to improve so much (not all from Ally Mc Beal has to be good) if they want to make an album to listen it and not an album to have more money.Vonda we aren't fool!"
5,absolutely 5 stars,"I've always loved this cd - I've always loved the music on Ally McBeal. Recently, I had a beach party - this cd was on my mix - random - everyone went wild! What is this???? Now I've bought 10 copies for all my friends because they love it as much as I do. Vonda Shepard's voice and rhythm are absolutely awesome-what a perfect mix of voice and music. Thank you, Vonda!"
4,Another excellent cd,"This one is as good as the first Ally McBeal soundtrack. Good songs, with the superb performance by Vonda Shepard, and a coerent feeling that makes it a joy to listen to the whole cd, not just a few favorite songs. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one as well."
1,Flat,Vonda Shepard is so Lame it ain't even funny.on the Show Barry White has Benefited more than her.and the Show was Focused around Her Music?How Much Did they pay Al Green to Sing with This Tune-Less Lame? The Songs Have No Feeling.They Should turn The Music Aspect of The Show To Barry White.His Music is The Only True Draw.
5,Perfect if you are a romantic!,"Being a hopeless romantic, these songs found their way right into my heart! I know him by heart fits me so perfectly and I love her remakes (Crying is especially well-done) and Vonda's own work shines, too! Heart and soul...perfect title!"
3,Pretty Good,This cd is really good but it is also a little slow...perfect for rainy days. Some of the songs like 100 Tears and Read my mind are really good but others are a little too slow. Other than the slow pace it's an excellent cd
4,Thanks Vonda!,"I picked this CD up and looked at the song list and thought - hang on, I don't recognise many of these. But as soon as the CD started playing pictures appeared in my mind of Ally and the gang, which made me enjoy the music even more. The CD didn't need to have Songs from Aly McBeal plastered on the cover but if it makes more people listen to it, and love every second of it, then that's definitely a good thing, don't you think?"
1,Very disappointed.,Not at all what I expected....I know she can do better and I hope she does in future. Don't bother.
3,Good CD,Ordered CD whereas I'm a huge fan of the show - got it for a birthday present the entire series. The music is one of my favorite parts of the show. This CD is good- but doesn't feature ALL of the music from the show. Looking for song by the black gospel singer who sings at all the funerals in the show. Anyone know if she has a CD please let me know.Vonda has a great voice and I still like the CD - it's good!!
5,Execellent Sophomore Outing,"Bravo to Ms. Shepard for another wonderful album. As a devotee of the show (and of classic rock) I truly enjoyed the covers of ""Vincent"". ""This Old Heart of Mine"", ""To Sir with Love"" and ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted?"" The original songs (like ""I Know Him By Heart"") evoke more feeling in me that I realized. My only disappointment was with ""100 Tears Away"" - this is a lovely song, and I felt the album did not do it proper justice. WIth that exception, Ms. Shepard should be more than proud of this latest endeavor."
5,Best of 3....,"I go way back with Vonda Shepard, and I started watching ""Ally"" when I read an early piece that talked about her music and the old pop standards favored by David Kelly. ""Heart & Soul"" was fine, and the 3rd CD is just starting to grow on me (Sting & Al Green on the same CD? How could it fail?). But this is my favorite and the only one I rate a 5. The ""soul"" of the pieces drills through the whole effort, with the key songs being ""Crying"" (better than Don McLean, not quite up to Roy Orbison's falsetto) and a new effort, ""Baby Don't You Break My Heart Slow"" with heartbreaking harmony between Vonda and Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls. Woven together well, a collection of old songs made new by Shepard, with her lush voice and excellent song backdrops. Great CD for a long trip!"
5,Try it,"I would definitely get this book along with a phrasebook and/or some Creole music. Granted, it could be a phrasebook itself, I think it's pretty functional by itself."
5,The Best Electronic Album of the 1990's,"Pure and simple this is a must have for any collector of electronic music whether you are into Industrial, or IDM, or ambient it doesn't matter. This album was 10 years ahead of it's time and not one song sounds like the next yet it's a perfect execution of audio brilliance.If there was a book of ""The Perfect Album"" this would be on the cover...."
4,One of their better albums,"I listened to most of Download's albums to find one that I wanted to buy my boyfriend for Christmas, and I would have to say this one was the best. If you're looking for something that sounds like Skinny Puppy, you may be in the wrong place, but don't give up on this band yet. I've listened to this album a few times, and each time I find something new and interesting about it. It's definitely one of their better works, and probably a good place to start listening!"
5,One of the best,"As a long time skinny puppy fan, this cd was both a surprise and a treat. This cd, in my oppinion was the best thing to come from the SP guys in a long time. Much better than ""The Process"" and the latest Skinny Puppy album ""greater wrong of the right"". Even though this isnt a SP cd, i think its the last thing to come from the guys that really had the edge i always expected from skinny puppy. And i dont quite get the FLA fans argument, to me personally FLA was always one of the more generic sounding industrial bands. The 1st time i ever heard this cd, we listened to the cd front to back, and all sat in quiet amazement for a minute or two after the last song.Definately one of my favorite all time cd's!"
4,LOUD!,"Loud, and hard to turn off (that's good.) Bought it for my daughter, she likes it, and she was resistant at first."
1,Incomplete Description,This has no A/C connection. That does not appear in the description. I threw the player in the trash when I opened the package because I can't use it.
4,"good cuff, convenient use","This BP cuff works well for quick and accurate reads. You will have to practice using the trigger for accurate reads. The bladder itself is of very high quality material. The dial and balloon in one piece takes all the fumbling out of play. The whole handpiece is very light but durable. The dial is easy to read and the crystal is very clear. Easy to use in right or left hand-but again, you have to practice using the trigger release; it take finesse and getting use to."
3,not bad,"I work in community nursing, so I needed a good portable BP cuff. This one's ok, not great. The tubing between the cuff and hand piece is very short, making it a little difficult to work with. The trigger valve is nice though, it's not difficult to operate at all like some reviews may have you think. After a few practice runs on family, I was able to use the trigger valve with ease."
1,Not Durable,"We expected to use it in our medical office more than 2 weeks. Then the needle went to 300 and wouldn't release.I opened the case of the dial, and could see that it was cheaply made. I like the ADC stethescopes, but don'tget this BP cuff!"
5,great cuff,I'm happy with my purchase. The trigger style control is easy to get used to. Every sphygmomanometer should have the gauge attached to the bulb like this. It just makes sense.
2,BAD PURCAHSE,"This book contains too many incorrect errors and sloppy made tabs that arnt even close to the way they are played!Who made who is played in C,A,G...NOT D,C,A like this book shows.......I dont even know what they have tabbed as the solo for Whole Lotta Rosie.. but trust me its 100% wrong!!!!!dont pay more then $5 for this book, because theres not much to be learnt from inccorect tabbing!"
3,"Well made, but NOT 12"" long","I ordered these automotive disposable gloves to use while polishing under water with a pumice stone. They are just the right thickness and well-made (did not fall apart). However, the box clearly states that these gloves are 11"" in length, not 12"" as advertised. And I bought the large size (my hands take a size 7 1/2 to 8 ring size) which fits women's large hands fine.They are also hard to remove from the box from the side openings; they packed in like sardines. Once you remove about 4-5 pairs, it should be easier to access the rest.A bit pricey for disposable gloves, but since I am not an automotive mechanic, and will only be using them occasionally, they will probably last me years.These are latex, so do not purchase if you are allergic to latex."
4,Destiny...,"I love books that flirt with the concept of destiny. This one intertwines romance, betrayal, mystery and passion without getting too off kilter with the drama like some other stories can. I also enjoyed how the friend where bound through the history of the families. It was Great I can't wait to read the Prequel. The only thing that i was confussed on was the randomly place photo inside the book. not quite sure if that was even supposed to be there."
2,Flat and empty...,"I read this book on a recommendation that Ann Rice should beware of the new Gothic rage of Paulette Crain...sorry, there's no contest! The characters in Delore are flat, one dimensional, and wholly unrealistic... which is pretty much how the whole book was. As a gothic mystery, it was entertaining, but it lacked richness. I'm hoping her next with have some more depth, a richer tapestry and more cohesiveness...but the prelude at the end of this looked wild and erratic...but I applaud the effort and I'll give her a chance! To be fair, Anne Rice hasn't turned out anything good in a LONG while, but wouldn't it be glorious if all gothic stories were as finetuned as The Vampire Lestat? *sigh*"
1,Not a 5 Star Book.,"I agree with the reader who said the situations were contrived and somewhat boring---actually they were mostly boring, but that wasn't what made it a bad book. What I found hard to suffer through was all the bad sex. Now I like sex, I don't mind hearing about other people's or even watching it on TV, and no, it doen't make me uncomfortable. But I don't want to read about some fourty year old virgin who has sex with a vampire, then about her brother having sex with a vampire, and then about her having sex with her brother... About men having sex with their grandfathers and women being raped by their brother-in-laws, and so on and so on. Basically there's just too much stupid sex between a lot of people who think they're all rich and glamourous. Now, the plot line wasn't bad and I actually used to like reading Nancy Drew--when I was 12! But, there's no way I could give my 12 year old daughter this book."
5,Best blades made.,"It is tough to locate the old twin Sensor blades, but they do the best job and are worth the search."
2,Gillette Sensor Cartridges,"I bought these for the men in my life and the opinion poll came back as follows: ""There is that occasional bad blade that pops up in the package every so often...""Of course, I have no idea if this is the general rule, I only purchased 4 packages all in one order, if memory serves me.The price was enticing as we all know how costly this item can be at the drug store.Figuring in the cost of shipping and potential wasted blades, I'm not sure I would order again."
5,Many shaves out of each blade.,"I have been using this item for years, and after trying others will keep coming back to it. Each shave is perfect and I can get as many as 30 out of each blade."
2,Get the Sensor Excel instead.,I got these but usually use the Sensor Excel blades. These ones were not sharp and got snagged up with hair more easily. The Excel blades are better I believe and you also have the lubricating strip for smoother shave.
1,$20 shipping? hello?,"I get it that you need to charge for shipping. $4.99 is steep but when I put in a quantity of 4, the shipping is $19.96? WTH? You could ship 4 packages of blades for *a lot* less than that. If anything, the shipping should stay the same almost regardless of quantity (within reason...)Sorry but this is no deal the way you have shipping configured. Maybe this is amazon's issue but there's no way I'd pay $20 in shipping for 4 packages of blades."
5,Old Faithful...,"My old razor keeps hangin' on so I keep buyin' blades for it.It's been a great,SIMPLE TO USE razor that does a wonderful job.I'll hate to see it go.Got a great price on these blades..."
3,Editorial gaffs hurt image of solid work,"Duffy obviously knows his subject well (5 stars), but his efforts are substantially compromised by what can only be described as poor editorial efforts at the publisher, which results in numerous typos that diminishes the value of Duffy's work. The dust jacket even contains typographical errors, including a misspelling of another title offered by the publisher. Readers should not be made to suffer this way."
3,Great Book bad editor,"I have been interested in Field-Marshal Suvorov for years. The writing is wonderful and insightful but the publisher Emperor's Press should review their policies. This is not the first title that seems to have been rushed to press without basic editing. My background on the topic is not as extensive as Mr. Nafziger, but I would suggest he read Art of victory; the life and achievements of Field-Marshal Suvorov, 1729-1800 By Philip Longworth, published 1965."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"First of all, I'm a real Anglophile and can sit still for endless videos about the Royal Family, Stately Houses, pomp and circumstance of any kind BUT this defeated me. The s-l-o-w progress through the houses, with repeated shots of things already seen, the endless long views of the houses from the air, the stifling commentary of Selina Scott all combine for one long snooze."
4,Great,"Great to help with stamina, Really helps you recover from hard work, just take a couple and get back after it. No crash just natural energy."
3,Minor Results,"The energy gains from taurine have not been conclusively presented in clinical trials, but I have noticed minor increases in energy at night time, if taken on an empty stomach."
5,Right On!,Andrew Adair is a up and coming breath of fresh air in the jazz world. This new release is a great take on some old releases. The music is played with great sensitivity by the artist. Not only is Mr. Adair arranging with new vigor he is playing Right On with his style.
5,The Way of Being. Outstanding Book,"Ursula K. Le Guin did a remarkable job in bringing us her translation of this magnificent book that will lift your heart, bring more understanding to your mind, free your ego from its grip on your life, and bring your soul peace from the ancient and extraordinary verses in this book.This is one book that would bring harmony to anyone, when taken into the depths of consciousness. It will show you the way of being. It will help you live with what IS, and that alone will help free you from pain.Highly recommended for its profound truth, and the extraordinary difference this truth can make in your life. Deserves 10 Stars."
5,A-1 INTERPRETATION RATHER THAN TRANSLATION,"THIS VERSION COMES ALIVE TO THE READER.IT IS MADE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.AFTER STUDYING GIA-FU-FENG, BRIAN WALKER, TAM C. GIBBS and THOMAS CLEARY, I FOUND THIS VERSION TO BE NOT ONLY REFRESHING BUT PROBABLY THE BEST ACCESS TO THE TAO EVER AVAILABLE.THIS IS NOT A TRANSLATION LIKE THE OTHERS, BUT AN INTERPRETATION BY ONE OF THE GREAT IMAGINATORS OF OUR PERIOD.URSULA K. LE GUIN HAS ECLIPSED HERSELF IN THIS BODY OF WORK.I HOPE THAT AFTER ONE READS THIS, THEY INVESTIGATE HER PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED GENIUS (like THE LATHE OF HEAVEN)...DAVID BECHTA"
1,TERRIBLE!!,worst translation that i have ever seen. really boring and just outright wrong. wish that I hadn't purchased it as well.
2,The Way this is Not,"This book gives alot of information about the Tao Te Tching, however, it does not do anything more than further distance people from the true meaning. I bought this book a couple of years ago and it was then a little helpful. The more that you explore minds like, Osho, Bodhidharma, and Chang Tzu, the more distancing this book becomes. To those who are pursuing enlightenment, take heed, this is the way to knowledge, not the way to knowing. Do what I did and read some Osho, Sun Tzu, Chang Tzu, and more Lieh Tzu and come back to this book...you will see what I am talking about."
1,Do NOT buy this poorly produced version of the book.,"Ursula Le Guin's first edition of this book published in 1997 is much better and true-er to the great and magical classicTao Te Ching, attributed to Lao Tzu. This ""blue"" version has poorly printed text and the most offensive noisy flute CD's disrupting Le Guin's spoken words. I could not even listen to the complete first poem on the CD, and repacked it all immediately for return to amazon (which is fortunately an easy no fuss process), and found an ""as new"" previously owned version of the 1997 book, which is divine... Now I am happily taoing..."
5,The power of the Tao,"This book represents, not another translation of what must be one of the most translated books in existence, but rather the careful reworking of it, by one of America's excellent writers. Ursula Le Guin is well known for her literary achievements. With this small volume she takes the first steps on the road that, if it can be walked on, is not the true (or real) road. She does a marvellous job with the verses and makes poignent -and sometimes pungent - notes. Hearing her read the text, which is contained on two CD's which come with the book, is a wonderful opportunity for the reader to experience a whole new dimension of this material. I would recommend this book to anyone with even the slightestin it, even if they are very familiar with other versions of it."
1,too much!,"I'll be the first to admit my admiration for Le Guin as a writer and a person. But there is zero justification for this new interpolation. Like Mitchell's ""New English Version,"" it further trivializes Taoism in order to make the Tao Te Ching more palatable to the (New Age) masses. The worst part is that Le Guin's and Mitchell's versions are gaining a bigger and bigger foothold in the market of TTC translations. One wonders how many people have absorbed this stuff and called themselves ""Taoists"" afterwards. I shudder to consider it."
3,Unrealistic,"Definitely not for the casual reader and Le Guin's ""helpful"" notes at the bottom are really not that helpful.I also find some of Lao Tzu's suggestions, especially for wise leadership, to be unrealistic, at least for modern society.*Review re-posted from goodreads.com"
1,Too Hard to Undersatnd,"Fortunately for the author there is the only one book on the subject, his. I wish there was a legal guide that would make it easy for someone who is only used to the system in the U.S. and Canada. I really had a hard time with this book. It should be written more for the layman and in simpler language. On top of that, it is really boring and dry. I think the author could have made it more interesting by injecting some humor and anecdotes. Perhaps a question and answer format would be better. Hopefully someone will come along and do a better guide for us Gringos. Until then we will have to put up with this boring one-of-a-kind book."
5,Phenomenal,"This ballet is gorgeous. The costumes and sets are meticulous and lovely, as is the dancing. The only complaint I have is of the camera work (which is often a distraction ballet recording, in my opinion). Over all, this is a wonderful production; Dupont's Aurora is lovely and delicate without being too girly, and her technique is impressive without being garish."
1,Misdirected,The director is incredibly intrusive. The camera is never allowed to rest on corps or soloist. All stucture of the choreography is lost.
2,Does not meet my expectations,This version of Sleeping Beauty was a deep disappointment to me bacause it devated from the origional dance of the many versions I have enjoyed during the years. This version had many extra scenes that did not add to the story.
3,Okay toy.,"My kids liked it for a litte while, then it got old. It is somewhat durable and interesting for a child for a little while. My kids moved on to other toys after a month or so. One of the wheels broke off prematurely. The plastic peice that the wheel snaps onto broke. I would have preferred to buy a toy that can maintain a child's interest for longer and be more durable."
3,Much Closer to Kingston Trio Than Buffalo Springfield,"As a big fan of Stephen Stills and, to a lesser degree, Richie Furay, I picked this up out of curiosity. It turns out to be folk music along the lines of the Kingston Trio, well sung by a group of around 9 kids, ages 18-21, including the aforementioned future stars. Much of it is extremely lightweight, often silly and too cute for my tastes. Stills handles lead vocal on two songs, one of which (""High Flyin' Bird"") is the only track on the album that really hints at what was to come for him and Furay. Perhaps a true folk music fan might find this holds up well on its own merits, but for those of us more inclined towards rock 'n' roll, I'd say pass, unless you're such a strong CSNY/Buffalo Springfield fan that you really need to have everything. Me, I need to have everything."
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,"Totally worthless. It's supposed to fit the Nokia 6126, but fails miserably. It's very cheap plastic, and probably less structurally sound than the phone. The back plate fit okay, but marginally. The front plate didn't fit at all. I can only assume at this price that they're counting on the fact that no one is going to go through all the hassles of returning it. If there was an option for negative stars, I'd give it that."
5,Wow,"Winter is just unbelievable.I know some people who didn't like the book, but I personally found it amazing, and so did my parents, who I forced to read it after I finished.John Marsden has written another amazing piece of work. Like all his other books, it's got an edge to it, although the storyline of this book isn't quite as alternative as some of his other books, it has an almost ""detached"" feel to it.Absolutely amazing. I would recommend this book, and any other by John Marsden to any one over the age of 15."
1,Disappointing,"After reading and liking several of John Marsden's book, I looked forward to reading this one.Unfortunately, this reads more like a rough first draft than a completed novel: sub-plots are left unresolved, characters react completely out of character (and no explanation for why is given, or even acknowledgement that the characters has just acted oddly is given), and the main character, unlike Marsden's other ""troubled"" teen female protagonists, does not evoke any sympathy."
1,Yuck,"I hated using this thing. HATED! It was painful, and didn't even shave my legs all that well. AWFUL. Don't waste your money. This razor totally turned me off to all electric shavers. Whatever you buy, don't get this!"
4,"""Steak"" your claim on this campy CD today!","Sure it's a cheesy instrumental collective of pop 60's standards set to really campy ""Muzac"" tones...that's THE BEST PART of it!! Like something in the background you'd hear in a steak house or dare I say elevator?! These people know their warped audience and don't care who finds and considers them to be ""bastardized"" covers! My copy was very cheaply purchased re-sold, but I consider it to be one of the best silly things I have in my collection!! Bravo!"
2,Overrated,"The HRCI is an incestuous organization more interested in financially preying on others in the HR community than actually sharing HR knowledge. If it were not so, they would not charge such exhorbitant fees for their learning systems and guides. The pracitce questions and answers in this guide may help prepare for the PHR/SPHR exam, but you should see if you can find a used copy or borrow one, rather than buy a new copy. While the HRCI will tout ""new content"", it isn't worth the cost of the new copy."
5,Best quality thermal for the money,I love the athletic fit and quality of this thermal. I have some that have lasted 3 years and are the same except for the stains I put on them. They actually do a great job insulating in the colder weather under another layer of clothes. I will only buy these thermals from now on.
2,Soft and Stale,"Even after roasting, they were soft and had this prominent off and stale oil taste. I was stuck with all four bags of bad nuts."
1,16 languages no 6.,"The discription says it will translate 16 languages. It only does 6. The other 10 are through an on line pay service.1 month free trial.It is to imbed its translation bar in Word an Excel for translation, but even with their patch it could not do it."
2,Instant Immersion Translator Deluxe 2.0,I ordered this product so I could write my friend in China. I installed it correctly. The product did what it was supposed to do here. I wrote a letter in Chinese copied it to my e-mail and sent it to China. My friend could not read it as she received all question marks. There was not one word of Chinese in the letter that she received. I don't know if it's the product that didn't work right or her computer that's not receiving Chinese language properly. My english e-mails did work though. If the makers of this product can investigate the problem and fix it so it works at both ends then I think this product would be very usefull. She did send me a letter in Chinese and the product did translate it for me so most of it does work.
4,This is the classic Art Car film,"I only recently saw this movie despite being near Art Cars for a number of years. (My daughters have worked on a couple of Minneapolis Art Cars.) It's a little bit dated now, with many of these cars no longer out there and several new generations of Art Cars and Mutant Vehicles having been made since the movie came out. Still, it's a great introduction to the Art Car and to the naive art impulses that lead to them."
1,no results,"I really like Peter Thomas Roth's products, which are made with cutting-edge science and have been uniformly top skin care performers. however, after about a month of using this product as per the instructions, I saw absolutely no reduction in any wrinkling, nor any positive change at all. I guess it just didn't work for me. I'll stick to his Mega Rich Cellular Creme, which DOES give me noticeable, great results in wrinkle reduction as well as moisturizing my oily yet dry skin."
2,no big difference,"I bought this product for a fair amount. I saw a review of it in a magazine in an article written by a dermatoligist. It sounded great. I have used the product for a month and see no big difference at all. I will finish it, but don't think I will try this line again."
1,I Returned This Book,"This book is not at all what I expected. It is a *really* basic approach to how this stuff works. No real theory at all. I decided to return it within ten minutes of receipt. I like Watson's style, but I did not like the book. It would be good for a newbie who doesn't know anything yet. A better title would be 'General Information on Really, Really Basic Principles of Automotive Operations: With EFI' or 'Induction for Dummies: When to Use a Dual-Plane Intake'. The book is mistitled; I'd give it 2.5 stars, but the title gets Zero stars."
4,Battery comparison,"I recently compared the Energizer with the Duracell Ultra which is more or less in the same price class. We are busy developing a new electronic gadget for monitoring pressure of truck tyres. I connected both the Energizer and the Duracell Ultra to a 1.64mA constant resistance load. I found that the Energizer was behind the Duracell all the way on my Voltage-Time graphs. I found it interesting to see that the Energizer tend to loose more power under low temperatures (zero degrees Celcius), but tend to stay near the Duracell in near room temperatures. Well thats my remark. I only want to say this, its after all not a bad buy..."
2,Inadequate subject coverage,I picked up this book to review statics and mechanics of materials and found it missing much fundamental information on the subject. No mention was made of the concept of Mohr's Circle which is useful in visualizing computation of combined stress states. The solved problems tend to be inadequate in explaining the subject. It was helpful however to have statics and mechanics of materials in a single text (a bargain buy!). Pick another text to either learn or review this subject.
2,Mediocraty at it's finest,"The book isn't overall bad, but the explanations assume a strong comprehension of the subject. As for statics and mechanics, it is merely a few select cases, and fails to actually help. Several vital steps are omitted outright, so you'd be better off skipping this book, and searching for a question and answer bank."
5,Excellent CD -- Buy it if you can find it...,"A friend of mine works for a radio station in Cambria, CA (KOTR, 94.9) and he recommended I check this out about 4 years ago. Gregory Page has since become one of my favorites. Get this if you can...you won't be disappointed. My only complaint: no new CD since 1995!?"
5,Awesome song writer!,YEAHHHHHH!!!! I finally got my copy of his first and only CD to date. So hard to find this one in any record stores. If you like modern folkish style music (see Jewel) you will love Gregory Page. This CD is a must buy!
4,Goes great with a bottle of Jameson,"This album contains some enjoyably amusing tunes, but is even better for its lamentable songs."
2,Dismal sound engineering spoils good performances.,"An example of how NOT to record opera. Absolutely dismal, spoiling a fine cast of singers and musicians. Did the sound ""boffins"" at EMI have cotton wool in their ears?"
3,Disappointed...,"Item ordered on 12/8/10, received on 12/22/10.....item was smaller than described, was expecting a larger dish. And the description included some Creme Brule Ramekins which I didn't receive..."
2,cash crop,"Not a particularly good CD. It's basically just the label who's releasing it trying to cash in on some good old songs. Reggies take on South Of Heaven is funny. The Get Up Kids cover of ""On With The Show"" is a standout. Other than that, it's overrated."
2,Interesting take on 80's metal,"It's a novelty record. Buy it - listen to it once - put it away. The cover of Wasp's ""Animal"" is ok. Reggie's take on ""South of Heaven"" is funny. Not worth buying in my opinion."
3,tasty flavors,"I love bars in a couple different flavors, including chocolate chip. Mostly because they do not contain high fructose syrup, and also because they provide a healthy in between meals snack."
4,Cheaper at Walmart,A great tasting bar if you are in a hurry. We go through a lot of them. Walmart sells the same item in an 18 count box here in Michigan for $3.99. This is a lot better price than anything I have found online.
5,Kids live on these,We go through these like water - actually faster than water. So happy that we can buy them in bulk at a great price. Thanks Amazon.
5,"Having read all the reviews, this is what I think:","I've read all the reviews of Schmidt's efforts on matter of European Integration. And here's what I think: She is destined to embrace the English model and the English model, I'm convinced, will embrace her. The two will be as one. They will be a European Union far more robust than anything concocted in Brussels. So I, for one, would like to celebrate that true union of politics and passion and hoist a glass to Schmidt and this English Model!"
5,You pay for quality,"Warehouse home improvement stores stock a variety of loppers. If you want really good ones, walk out and find a dealer or distributor of Felco products.I've used several brands that vary in construction and materials. Something you don't often think about is weight. Carbon handles on this model reduce weight which allows you to complete more work with more comfort. They're also strong. The blades are made of high quality steel that holds an edge. Forget dulling the blades on a cheap pair and putting them in your garage sale 2 years later. These will provide you with years of service and when they do need a change....they're replaceable. The blades on most brands are not! Spend the extra money on these loppers and never have to buy another pair."
4,Simon and Garfunkel's music is always magic and didn't age.,"When I discovered Simon & Garfunel'song, they were already going their separate way and belonged to the generation before mine, but I nonetheles was very much taken by their lyrics, music and voices. I bought this CD two weeks ago, and when I want to listen to it, I invariably have to go and look for it in my oldest daughter's room, and she is thirteen. Theirs is really a music which defies time."
5,"Rick ""Rhino"" Jensen","The Best of the Best. From someone who grew up during the 60's & 70's. This album is(IS)one of the best of all time.You can't listen to this album without feeling the Love,the turmoil, the excitement of the times. It is by far a must in everyone's Life."
2,"Great songs, poor CD","Unfortunately, someone was not paying attention when they coded the titles for the songs. I had to edit almost every single song in Windows Media Player. Very unprofessional. I like the songs, though. The one correct one was The Sound of Silence."
2,Be careful..sound quality is bad,"I think the song selection is quite good; however, the mastering of this disc is quite awful..Many of the songs are distorted and the sound quality is quite poor. I would strongly consider other options before buying this. Please note, that I am not even an audiophile and I can tell the sound quality is poor, so I imagine someone with a high tech sound system would be greatly disappointed."
1,Sound Quality Poor,"Very, very disappointed in the quality of this CD. The hiss was like listening to an old cassette tape from 30 years ago. On quieter songs, it is horribly noticeable. And the same loud hiss is not there when listening to previews of the songs on the Amazon product page, meaning that the hiss shouldn't be attributable to the source material being older recordings. If I'd known there was this difference in quality, I would not have ordered the CD."
1,Sound was Awful,The sound was awful and you couldn't understand what they were saying. Not a good copy of the CD.
2,terrible sound!,"If you check the reviews on this item, you should notice that it's the newest reviews that complain strongly about sound quality. Something happened in this span of about a decade to change the production of this CD.I agree with another reviewer . . . my old TAPE of a similar S & G album is better than this. I will order a CD of that album instead of this CD, which I turned off halfway through, it was so irritating. I also prefer the studio productions of the album on the cassette better than these. Can't tell if these were the original renditions. If so, they're not as good as some of the later productions (just my opinion), and are useful mainly as a collector's item in the historical sense.Get another S & G album . . . this one will disappoint!"
2,Horrible Sound!,"I have cassette tapes and MP3's that sound better than this album...no joke! However great compilation of songs almost all the ""best of"""
5,The best of the best,"From the haunting, ""Sounds of SIlence"" and ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" to the jazzy ""Cecilia"" and ""Hazy shade of winter"" and the gutsy ""The Boxer"", this album is a must for Simon & Garfunkle fans. Other hits include the lovely ""El Condor Pasa"" and ""Scarborough Fair"""
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CD! THE SOUND QUALITY IS FRAUDULENT..,"As stated by others, there is something seriously wrong with the sound of this CD. It is awful and should not be on sale. Get another compilation."
2,"Yeah, I heard it-","Yeah, I heard it-the crackles and pops of a vinyl transfer on Bridge Over troubled Water on this compilation. The main reason I bought this album was for that single song and it was a dissappoint ment. Many other songs are overmodulated and splat on the high end such as Hazy Shade of Winter. Spend a couple more bucks and get one that's truly remastered. I don't recall the price here on Amazon but I paid $7.99 for this album at Wal-Mart 2 yrs. ago!"
4,Takes me back,This collection does a very nice job showcasing the height of Simon and Garfunkel. It will take you back and make you smile.
4,Ideal for the broke fan or the S & G infant,"I can't get myself to give a cd made of entirely re-released material five stars. But this CD is a godsend. If you are going to make your S&G ""collection"" to only be a single disc, this is the one you want. It has a very large selection of S&G's absolute best, and then there's the unreleased song ""My Little Town,"" which is a really good one, too. This collection is sure to get compared to the ""Greatest Hits"" collection. Well, let me say this: this has almost all the same songs, minus ""Kathy's Song,"" but to make up for the loss of those two, it has an additional eight! Plus, the liner notes are much better, and I like the cover art better. If you're not going to spend the money to buy all 5 of S&G's albums, then this is the CD you need to pick up."
3,Another updated collection,"Yes, the quality of the recordings is superior. Yes, the song selections are mainstream. Yes, the sound and the memories are good. That said, this seems one more collection of songs destined to generate a little income, and replace the older ""greatest hits"" album from the early 70's. The other purpose could be to generate a little extra (or advance)publicity for the duo in support of Art Garfunkel's new DVD and Paul SImon's proposed fall album release. It is a good starting point for an introduction to the music of Simon and Garfunkel and represents a commercial cross section of their efforts. However as a long term admirer of their work there was little new in terms of arrangements except for ""Fakin It"" as a mono cut. All in all, it is basically a cleaned up greatest hits compilation with little to offer their long term fans, but with a great assortment for first time listeners."
4,ENJOY THIS TYPE OF MUSIC,I have enjoyed this type of music since it first came out many years ago. Still a fan of Simon and Garfunkel. Great to have them on my Kindle
2,two for the price of one,i thought that i was gettiing two different cds. that didn't happpen.going to pay pal then back to amazon.com. may have caused purchaseing two. one of carrying cases is cracked. but the disc it self seems to be ok.i will keep the second one for a spare. i apears to be in good shape. i did not try to play it yet since the other one is still working.one paid for buy gift card and the other paid for by pay pal.
4,Great tunes!,"The music fit the times. Cool, smooth and a bit romantic. It's hard to complain about the classics from my youth."
3,Great Track Selection but Not So Great Sound!,"I know that relative to the other Greatest Hits album, the sound quality here is better but it's still very poor compared to what other remastered albums out there sound like. To be fair to the record company, nowhere on the cd does it say ""remastered"". It just says mastered by Vic Anesini. Let's hope they truly remaster this album soon by unearthing a much better master tape from the vaults. Volume levels are very low and although cleaner than the old versions, the overall sound is quite ordinary. Other than that, the track selections are very good and truly represent the best work that this dynamic duo have done. Simply great harmonies and great examples of brilliant songwriting on every track."
5,Essential to Any Music Collection,"Loving these artists but not being a total hard-core fan who probably would want a box-set or individual albums, this disc was perfect for me. If I were compiling a list of top 100 CDs, this one would be on it for sure.The quality/remastering sounds excellent and warm for a cd. Even if you are spoiled by or prefer the sound of SACD/Dvd-A as I do, you will be pleasantly suprised by the high quality, non-fatiguing, non-harsh sound of this disc. This is consistant throughout. If you happen to be someone who has only heard some of these songs on the radio or as mp3s, this will be a real ear-opening experience for you as you hear new detail and experience a totally new and enhanced impact and deeper involvement than ever before."
2,uneven sound,I am really disappointed in this cd. The selection is good but on about half the tracts the vocal component is so distant I can't even hear it.If you want to hear them sing don't buy this cd.
5,The Best Is Right,"As a former Hippy, I have to say that this is truly the best compilation of old S & G songs I have ever heard. It brought it all back..."
4,Good Memories,I think this music holds the test of time and brought some wonderful memories back to me as I listened.
4,"I've always been a big fan of Simon and Garfinkel, so why wouldn't I love they're best songs","I probably didn't even know why I liked them when I heard them for the first time. But ""WOW"" the harmoney they produced was awsome to my ears, and I still love listening to them. I have a thing for pretty sound, and they have that. They also take me back in time to a place I love remembering. Romantic times, and youth, and a coming of age."
4,"great music, so-so recording",This is the S&G collection to buy. Too bad some of the early recordings were so poor.
3,"Great selection, beware sound quality not great","Although the selection of songs is great, be aware that the sound lacks quality in several of the tracks, for example ""The Boxer"""
3,Bad sound quality,"The sound quality is so poor that I just can't listen to it. It's a shame, because the songs and the arrangements are masterpieces.It sounds dull and lifeless to me. The sound quality is also very inconsistent. Some tracks sound much thinner than others. I realize that they are taken from different albums and different periods, but it's not fun to listen to it this way. A mastering engineer should make an effort to have some consistency between the tracks."
5,Great songs,Good group of early tunes - easy to love. Great playlist to introduce a new generation to the original dynamic duo
4,This is good,I purchased this dvd to be used in the instruction at my driving school. It's a great tool for in-class training. Glad I bought it.
5,I added this to my library,"I have all her novels, just started reading the first one loaned to me. I was hooked and have purchased all of them to date even the ones loaned to me, to just have them and maybe read again."
3,Predictable but heartwarming,"Like the other Elm Quilt books, this one is heartwarming and easy to read. The author has a gift for capturing the true sense of relationships. The story is the same throughout the book, but each chapter is the same basic story told from the viewpoint of different people. At the end, it all comes together well, as you'd expect. Predictable, but heartwarming all the same"
3,Repetitive,"I found this book to be unbearably repetitive. The same situations with the same dialogs from the viewpoints of about 8 different characters were repeated again and again. It was very frustrating to read and I found myself skimming over parts of the book.That being said, I did enjoy the plot. Despite my earlier comment, I do think Jennifer Chiaverini is a great writer, as earlier books in the series have proven to me. I like reading the parts about quilting, of course, because I find it inspiring and it helps me to get in the mood to do my own quilting. Her characters and their relationships with one another are also interesting and dynamic.I do hope she will continue to add books to the series as I am a faithful follower of the series."
3,Not as good as the previous books!,"I have been a fan of Jennifer Chiaverini's work since the first book and each one has been full and rich. My expectations for her new book were high, I admit. Unfortunately, with this book she seems to have run out of steam. Many of the chapters are repetitious as she is telling the story from the different characters perspectives and though that is a writing technique that can be very effective, it just seemed a way to fill the pages. The only reason I gave this three stars instead of 2, was the book definitely got better towards the end and had an interesting twist which made it worth reading."
4,A Different Book,"I bought this book 3 years ago and I loved it! Jessi got a baby sitting job at a new clients house, instead of finding a house of kids, she found a house of PETS! The story starts from there. One day while she was sitting, one of the hamsters got sick, so Jessi tooh him to the hospital, and well you propably figured out that ""he "" was actually ""she"". Yes, the hamster was not sick, she was pregnet, and she gave birth to 10 hamsters! The clients were so happy that they gave one hamster to Jessi(named Misty), one to Mallory(named Frodo), and one to Jackie Rodowsky(named I don't know). It is a Great book and I highly recomend it to you."
3,good book but unrealistic too,"it's nice that jessi is given the responsibility of pet sitting a whole bunch of pets, but is it even legal to own that many pets without a permit? And I don't think it was responsible of jessi to turn the place into a hangout for the baby sitters and the baby sitting charges to come see the pets, that's not very responsible at all. I know that if I were on vacation and trusted someone with a key to come feed my dog and walk her I certainly wouldn't want strangers parading through my house, I'd take them to a zoo instead!"
4,Retraction,"Hello. I believe one of the reviews here is mine. I take back what I said, after reading that other people loved the book. Didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. Bye"
3,Don't let picture decieve you.,I am a very visual person and thought I was getting a large can and a small can when I placed the order. You don't this is just for a single large can of air. I would have bought something cheaper in a larger quantity if I had known. Product is good. Air is air.
4,It grows on you...,"The first few times I heard this album, I lamented the loss of the money I spent on it... A year later, I came back to it. This time I was amazed by it, especially the Title track, and left wondering why I disliked it in the first place.Granted, this EP isnt quite as good as the other Tear Garden releases, but there are several gems in here that make it well worth the cost. Give the CD some time, and it will grow on you..."
3,bag comes up short,"Overall I like the bag, but my computer barely fits in the bag and there is only one handle for carrying. This is particularly inadequate because the front flap does not secure to the bag ,it is only a magnetic type closure."
2,Frustrated.,"I bought this rug, based on the only review, for my son's 4th birthday. The biggest draw for me was the ""weight"" of the rug, and that the other reviewer said it was ""heavier"" than others. The dimensions of the rug are not specified, so I assumed... by price... that this rug would be big (at least by another foot).The rug arrived today and I am so disappointed! While it is still a decent play rug, it is much thinner and smaller than I expected (approx 3' x 6'). There is no way this rug weighs 5 lbs. For 20$ less I could have bought the exact same rug [...] and not paid [...]$ for shipping.I contacted the seller listed on the shipping label and received someone with a thick accent who could not communicate with me. I verified the number and name of the company, and then asked to speak with someone else. I was told there was no one else (at least I think that's what he said ;o).So. If you are looking for a thick, durable car rug, I don't think this is the one for you.Nicole"
1,Wrong color,"i was bummed to have to return this rug. the ""grass areas"" on the rug were brown, not green. it made the landscape look odd. my son, on the other hand, was having a blast on it...but for how much i spent on it, i would rather get something nice than something so-so."
4,Comprehensive yet understandable,"The book covered a lot of ground, yet was easy to understand and read. You will definitely understand more about the types of problems prolo handles, and how it works. Highly recommended to anybody considering this form of treatment."
3,"Very informative but overly ""boosterish""","This book was very informative, but it was written in a very informal style, with lots of Christianity thrown in. I found that the informality and religion distracted from getting the clear information on this medical technique. While the book gave me a good strong understanding of the technique, it left me worried that the authors were so enthusiastic about their technique that they might not be telling me the downsides of the technique. I recommend the book as a starting point, but more scientific information and less cheerleading and God would have been nice."
4,Good Stuff overall!,"First let me say Duende is my favorite song from the Karma album (which is my favorite album of currently 1187 audio CDs, but that version does not play well on radio because of the long intro. This album version has a shorter intro period before getting into the song fully. The spiritual collapse remix is also a very good rave-type dance version, but it would be hard to tell it from the original. In conclusion I recommend this CD single, especially if you like techno-dance type music. It gets 4-stars only because, I'm harsh and like the album version better."
4,"Good single, strange mixes.","First off: if you read the promo copy for this group that said how much Enigma fans would like them, and went looking for them based on that, this is probably not going to be to your taste. That said, it's still a decent single in its own right. The album version has nicely poetic lyrics, layered vocals, and lovely atmospheric music. The remixes, unfortunately, won't do much for you unless you are a fan of club music, and they do drag on rather too long. It's not that they're bad, it's just that they don't seem to have any place on the single. The upside to all this is that at least one of the tracks should move you. And for the price of admission, one's good enough."
3,Necessity,"Extremely boring, but then what tutorial isn't. It is necessary and therefore quite good. It helped me get a new job, but also put me to sleep on numerous occasions. My recommendation....study in a straight back chair with plenty of coffee (expresso) handy!"
2,Not a good investment,"this book was very overly ""spiritual"" in all of it's stories, to a fault really. Instead of Cinderella, there is ""Compulsivella"" and for Beauty & the beast, there is one titled, ""Beauty and the mark of the beast"". Someone gave us the book, I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars, is because it gave me a good laugh."
2,A Child Called Jesus,There was only one thing that I found to be wrong about the film was the editting. It should have been on 2 DVD's and not one. 3/4 thru the film they ran the Credits again ( Like the stars of the movie). It was very well made and the Actors were great. A really nice story. I am happy that I have it in my collection.
1,Rubbish!!!!!,"This book beggers belief, atrocious pictures, a pathetic weak story which is supposed (I gather) to put across some message of responsibility. I would recommend the author sticks to the day job which is obviously not working with children. A dreadful book. I wouldn't take a free copy. $17.99 what a rip off."
5,"HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY,....NOT!","As a long-term Wedding Present fan, I'm pleased to see this album getting such good reviews. If you are interested in the Wedding Present, and you like a bit of noisy angst in your music, then I believe this is where you should start. Great melodies buried beneath a wall of noise and feedback. To me it's an interesting contrast of love-lost, but sweet, lyrics, and music that portrays the underlying anger that often follows. It's not an easy listen at first, and if you put it on the hi-fi unannounced it provides a useful way of encouraging unwanted visitors to leave , but to me it remains the best album of the 90s and sounds as fresh today as the day I first heard it."
5,"It changed my life, what else?","Seamonsters is an underrated classic; one of the best rock albums I've ever heard. Takes a while for it to grow on you, but soon it will put the hooks in you. Powerful, with a strong emotional pull. Also perhaps Steve Albini's strongest work as engineer. A timeless classic."
5,Very Satisfied,"So far, I am very pleased with my purchase. It is quite the upgrade from my 6 year old imac! Everything seems to be functioning great and I love the look and feel of it all. The magnetic power plug is very smart and Photobooth is a lot of fun to play with. I was disappointed when it didn't have a firewire cable included and I had a heck of a time transferring files from my imac...P.S. if you can't open your old computer's harddrive that comes up through firewire onto your macbook's desktop, make sure that both computers have the latest version of Firmware on it. (It took over an hour for Applecare to suggest that to me on the phone.)"
1,BROKE TWICE IN THREE MONTHS,"I loved this computer for the first week. Then, it died. Just blackout died completely. When I took out the battery, it started right up. Two months later it broke again. Same thing but the battery trick didn't work this time. When I took it in, they said the hard drive was gone. They couldn't even recover any of the data. Getting it repaired took ten days after many, many phone calls to Apple to get me on an expedite list, because the hard drive was on back order!The guy at computer repair said it's been happening a lot with the MacBooks, that the hard drive is physically ruined."
2,Nice but not so good,la pantalla es demasiado chica. La bateria de calienta demasiado. A veces la uso sobre las piernas y realmente quema!!!
4,Great computer but runs too hot!,"The best computer I've ever bought. It's gorgeous and fun to use. I am actually proud to use this computer. I used to have a Dell and I hated it. My Dell looked like a brick and was full of spyware and viruses.It's a great feeling to never have to worry about viruses or spyware.I miss the right and left click mouse buttons though. Not sure why the Macbook just has one button. And the computer is very uncomfortable on my lap because of the heat. I usually have to place a towel underneath it. I would give it 5 stars if it did not heat up like a furnace on my lap.I definitely recommend purchasing this computer, if you are a PC user and are fed up with viruses and spyware. You won't miss the PC after about 2 months of using the Macbook. Join the Mac side. it's worth it!"
2,Apple's repair service is pretty terrible,"The individual system I bought from Amazon was a lemon. It worked, but erratically. So I take it in to the local repair shop, and it turns out that I had a bad logic board (that it, what most people call a motherboard) and they send it off to Apple to get the logic board replaced.That was *two weeks ago*. Apple says they don't have the part to replace, even after two weeks, and they don't know when they will be in stock.. So, I have paid for a computer that I cannot use (or even see...).When the system ran, it ran fine and was fast and all that. But if you are unwilling to wait forever if you need repairs, you should think twice before buying a MacBook."
4,Good but need to adjust Mac OX,"My old IBM X31 was dead, so I bought this new Mac. The design is fancy and it's fun for entertaining, but for work, I need to install additional software for Mac OX. Given the price, I think it's a good deal."
1,the thing just turns off...,"I bought a Macbook about two months ago, and I was very happy with it... until about three weeks ago, when it just started turning itself off. Completely randomly.Apparently, this is happening to many other people as well, judging by the chatter on the web.Do yourself a favor, and buy anything else. Don't buy this machine."
5,LOVE MY MACBOOK!!!!,"My Macbook is the best investment I have ever made computer wise. I have had it for about 4 months now and I read all of the reviews before I bought it. I read it gets too hot; it hurts my hands/wrists; it gets dirty where my hands rest, etc. I have not experienced any of those problems. Since I purchased mine, Apple has since released a slightly faster model. Mine is really fast and I use wireless high speed internet in our home and couldn't be happier.I will probably never go back to a Windows based format. The customer support with Apple (for questions and in-store training) is the best.Buy with confidence!"
2,MacBook May be nice but hard to use,"I ordered this unit from Amazon as my first MAC computer. The screen is too small, even after increasing the font sizes and zooming in I still had difficulty viewing the screen. Also the touchpad was nearly impossible to use. I suggest that anyone using this computer purchase a USB mouse to use with it because the pad is terrible.I do not suggest buying this unit as your first Apple computer."
2,Beautiful looking crib but horribly constructed,"Assembling the crib was nearly impossible and cheaply done. The pre-drilled holes were in the wrong place so we had to drill different holes in the frame. Additionally, the metal castors fall off if you try lifting the crib to move it. Although the crib looks great assembled, it is definitely not worth the price."
5,A great read!,"Gutting's book is packed with ideas and the treatment is crystal clear, concise, and surprisingly comprehensive. This is a wonderful book, written with real love, insight, and just a touch of nostalgia for a world unknown to many philosophers in the English-speaking world. I know of no better introduction to the last century of French philosophy, which Gutting shows to be an amazingly rich tapestry of thought. You'll definitely get your money's worth; just don't assume that reading this book will save you any time: It's so engaging that you'll finish it with a reading list of primary sources half a mile high!"
2,Concurring opinion,"I also run a small law office. After some research, I agree that the new version of the office suite and Corel Word Perfect is not worth the bucks. First of all, a more dependable word processor would be appreciated. Though WP has some great features, it tends to crash. There is NOTHING WORSE when you are on a deadline with the court. Further, the software manufacturer should remember that this is a very cost conscious group to whom they're pitching the product."
2,Corel's Mr. Freeze-up,"I manage a small law office, and have been using Corel WordPerfect as our standard word processing since v.4.2. The current version is not much of an improvement. Although some of the anscillary programs intergrate some useful features into WP, most of the ""extras"" are somewhat worthless. The calendaring program does not integrate with any other calendaring program, so it is impossible to share calendars with any other program or anyone else using a different program (or WP for that matter). But for the basic WordPerfect word-processing system, we have chosen to use other programs for spreadsheets (Excel), calendering (Outlook). We have Word installed on our system, and it appears to be a far more flexible and integratable system. All in all, WordPerfect 2000 Law Office is not worth the price."
5,bosch alternator,"it arrived almost instantly and couldnt be better......the price was absolutely rock bottom for a new alternator, name brand.....very pleased!!"
4,Herbert von Karajan conducting Sibelius,"The composer Jean Sibelius wrote shortly before his death, ""Only von Karajan understands my music."" There are,of course, other interpreters of his music who conduct it very well. But von Karajan had insights such as spacious breadth of tempo and unity that one hears in Wagner and Tchaikovsky--the composers who influenced Sibelius the most. The Berlin Philharmonic is at its very best--particularly in the climaxes."
2,Well written but...,"I just finished K.C.'s ""Rules of Engagement"" which I thoroughly enjoyed, so I rushed out and bought ""Lady in Waiting"". The book was very well written with a story line that hasn't been over-used, however, I couldn't finish it. The book was all from Jenny's point-of-view. I never knew what Collum was thinking or feeling unless he happened to be in the scene.If you don't mind reading a book from only one angle, than this book would be great. I, personally, like to know what the hero is feeling towards the heroine. It adds the spice I need in a romance novel."
4,Challenging exercise,"This is great exercise. I am in reasonably good shape and the first two workouts always leaves me exhausted. This is great for learning kickboxing at home.Having said that I will not give them a 5 star rating simply because the production qualities are poor. Max Chen's voice is inaudible. The biggest challenge is that the tempo in the thrird workout is so fast that I can never follow along with the DVD. I really have to pause the DVD at the instruction stage and follow the routine of 8,6,4,2 reps on my own. That takes away the fun of working out along with the instructors."
2,Drills and drills again..,This is my first time writing reviews. I am just so disapointed with this product. I feel the 5 star reviews were given by friends. The workout as stated by a reviewer before is mostly a bunch of drills of situps and pushups etc.. totally not a kickboxing routine!
2,What Kickboxing?!!,"After having actually worked out to people like Billy Blanks' Tae Bo and another kickboxing DVD I was looking to switch things up. So disappointed that this mainly focuses on training for actual matches instead of kickboxing to music which is what I expected. The ""headups"" in the first segment...just annoying. The ""crab crawls"" in the second or third segment...for what? If you're used to Tae Bo or Cathe Freidrech's Kick Max...skip this DVD."
3,Kickboxing,"This is not for the beginner. And not for anyone who experiences back pain or leg pain. It is a unique workout. Some very unusual moves. Not enough kicking practice. I would recommend highly the Jeanette Jenkins Hollywood Kickboxing workout. It is a fast, fun and rewarding workout."
5,nice workout,"the video is sometimes strange to watch. I do not like how each movement transition happens off screen. This makes it difficult to get into the proper position, when you are starting out and do not remember what each exercise is. However, the DVD has it where it counts, a good work out. At only 20 mins a session, it's very easy to find time. And for that little amount of time, it does a very efficient job at working out your whole body, even your neck, which was entirely new to me."
1,save your money,"This book really could have been a classic. The artwork seems to have been drawn by someone who is very inebriated, and watching too many cartoons. It's very distracting. I had to flip back to early in the book several times just to tell who is who. The story is very bland. You don't know any characters enough to even care about them. Also, I thought the professor who created the super-soldier serum was named ""Erskine"", or something close to that. And wasn't the serum only effective if it was combined with vita-rays. Without the rays they would have gone insane. Why didn't Isaiah age? Cap seemed to be older than Isaiah. The bottom line is there was a black Cap, but he was treated like trash and thrown away. If you see this book; buy something else."
3,Not enough letters,"Some of the letter examples were far fetched. I would of liked more samples of practical, everyday letters. Letters to distant relations, old school mates etc.. short snips that could also be used on facebook."
3,fretboard stamp pad,This is a handy item especially if you are watching someone on you tube. This stamp makes it easy to record the chord formations of the player you are watching. I bought one for my guitar teacher and he uses it quite often. I am not to pleased with the spongy ink pad. It is hard to get the right amount of ink on the stamp.
5,Guitar chord stamp & black ink pad,I found the guitar chord stamp & black ink pad very useful for writing out my chord charts for my jazz standard or other music charts that I use in my cover band gigs. It's convenient to stamp the chord on my sheet music and write out the chords very neatly so it's easy to read at rehearsal or onstage. This is a good deal if you need a chord stamp and black ink pad for transcribing your guitar sheet music.
4,Storytelling,"Margaret Read MacDonald is a fabulous storyteller! My favorites are ""Old One-Eye"", ""Parley Garfield & the frogs"", and ""Rolly Polly Rice Ball"". Pre K-1 graders LOVE ""Rolly Polly Rice Ball""! No one TELLS a good story anymore."
3,Below average construction,"I bought a bunch of flags for a classroom, this one is the worst constructed. Colors bleed together. Buy this from somewhere else."
3,"Okay, but not perfect.","While the flag is attractive and appears to be well-made, its proportions are wrong. It doesn't match the flag illustrated.The blue field should be about 40% of the length of the flag. Instead, it's fully half. The result is that the blue field is way too big and the top two stripes are too short. As soon as I looked at it, it was clear that the proportions are off. I had to measure to be sure, and the blue field is 30 inches wide, as are the top red and white stripes.It's too bad, because the flag is a great value otherwise. Colors are crisp, and the flag is nicely sewn together. I can probably display it and no one will notice, but it's obvious to me that insufficient effort was put into getting the details right. If accuracy is important to you, as it is to me, I'd suggest spending a little more and getting a First National Flag with the proper dimensions."
3,A good read,"I have always enjoyed R.L. Stiens Goosebumps books, as well as vampire books, and this combination of vampires and kids getting into mischief in the book makes for a great read for book readers of all ages. I would recomend this book to early readers to help keep them reading for a long time."
3,"Great ending, average story","Freddy and Cara are tough and fearless. When they accidentally find a hidden tunnel in Freddy's basement, they explore it. The tunnel leads them to a secret room with a coffin and a bottle labelled Vampire Breath.An old vampire appears and the content of the bottle take them back a century to the count's castle.It's a good idea but the action in the castle wasn't nearly as breathtaking as it should've been. Too bad cause the ending is great and worth 4 stars. But the story itself is mediocre."
5,Great Collection!,"I heard Martin Simpson in a tiny club near Ithaca, NY and he gave me chills just tuning up. A supremely gifted guitarist and interpreter of traditional music, Martin Simpson can take a song and make it his own. This collection features many great performances compiled from a couple of earlier albums including Grinning In Your Face; and Sad Or High Kicking. From the beautiful instrumental slide guitar arrangement of Cat Stevens' The First Cut Is The Deepest, to Son House's Grinning In Your Face, Martin Simpson never fails to captivate the listener with his soulful vocals and inventive guitar work. Other highlights include Roving Gambler, and a sublime performance of Anne Lister's beautiful tune, Moth. Simpson also plays some earthy banjo on Reuben. Highly recommended!"
5,Go Bruno!!,"Like many internet comics, I stumbled on this gem by accident. I read the strips abounding with weird wizards, sassy micro-dragons, clumsy rouges, goat-headed Goddesses, bartending demons, and various other oddities, laughed so hard my sides hurt, and got addicted. Unlike certain other reveiwers who have no basis for their mindless dislike, I think Bruno is one of the best internet comics out there, parodying everything from pop culture to classic fantasy stories. Ian McDonald has terrific insight, and I hope the strip continues to be successful for many years to come."
4,Good Audio for PMP Prep,This CD helped me prep for the PMP exam. I loaded it onto my iPod and listened to it when I rode the bus to work. It was helpful and I recommend it.
4,Great maps of the U.S.,"This reference not only has an excellent 2 page spread of the continental United States but also has expanded detail of the eastern, central, and western states. The rest of the world maps are good but not as crisply done as in Merriam Webster's Notebook Atlas, a good companion to this volume. Both are great bargains."
4,Not quite enough detail-but considering size it's great,"This 8 1/2"" by 11"" thin paperback is a handy reference when it comes to countries and major citie-not quite enough detail for one individual country."
2,Elevator music,"Mr. Boycottam's review sums it up. These melodies are nice, but heavy with too many instruments, too thick with tracks. I was looking for Irish banjo music; this album is ""easy listening""."
5,Top of the heap.,Such 'rightness' in music making is hard to come by. Celibidache and the MPO give you a benchmark reading of the 6th. I wonder why Sony has not put it out on DVD.
4,Very good single: I am impressed,"Tis a good single: it has a better version of ""Assimilate"" on it, and also ""Cage"" is a very beautiful song (reminiscent of Skinny Puppy's tendency to mix the beautiful sounding with the ugly sounding). I will admit, while Stairs and Flowers is an all right song, I saw no need for it to be on the CD twice (it is, after all, called ""Chainsaw"", not ""Stairs and Flowers"") and ""Chainsaw"" seemed all right. Overall, considering three fifths of it I loved, I'll give it four stars. Oh yes, and Brap on.-"
4,Know What you're buying?,"Actually for the money I'd give this a 5 star rating but gave it a 4 star for 2 reasons. I didn't like that it does not say Sherwood on it anywhere nor in the manual either, therefore It should not be avertised as Sherwood. It appears to be part of a sound system that can be purchased separately but it states 100 Watts per channel into 6 ohm, which most standard speakers are 8 ohm so therefore it's probably only 75 watts for most applications though the head-room and THD are other important specs to consider as well. The bottom line is I wanted the least expensive remote controlled amplifier I could find for the bedroom with a Digital Fiber Optic Input and this was it, $140 delivered to my door but some people may want to do their' home work to be sure of what they are buying."
4,Sherwood RD-8601 6.1-Channel Home Theate,The shipping only took a few days and came earlier than anticipated. The box was received in perfect conditions. After reading the instructions all installations went well and the receiver has the capability of connecting numerous devices. I was even able to use the old speakers with no problems at all. The sound is fabulous with connections for seven speakers.
3,"It works, but is out of date already","I bought the RD-8601 because my new TV only had a digital output (no analog outputs), so my older amplifier would not work with the TV. The sound is great (as I expected). I was not surprised when I received a rebranded SLS QG-500AVR because I had read the previous reviews. I do believe that the listing is misleading, so I reduced the review from 4 stars to 3 stars.The AMP works fine for me, no issues at all, because I still have an older cable box. If you have a new cable box and only have HDMI ports, then this product will not work for you as there are no HDMI ports on it."
2,Not what I ordered,"Ordered Sherwood RD-8601 got something else. No warning , no offer of recourse.Impossible to review features of Sherwood RD-8601 because I recieved a different reciever.While Amazon makes the statement that they do not suppress negative reviews, I will be suprised if this review sees the light of day."
1,was not as advertised,"this item was listed as new but when I got it, it was old and dirty.I tried to get a refund from Amazon but I got a snotty email back saying it didn't qualify for a refund . I contacted the seller and that sent a snotty leter back and said every thing thay sell was used BUT the listing clearly said NEW. the isssue is still un resolved to this day ."
4,Harry Benson: 50 Years in Pictures,"I was very pleased with the book itself, especially considering the very affordable price, but not so pleased with the wrapping of the book for shipping. It was simply inserted into a padded envelope and mailed, which was not enough protection for a luxurious hardbound book... the corners arrived all bent. It should have been sent inside a cardboard container of some kind. Or if put into a padded envelope, first wrappted in layers of padding, especially at the corners."
5,amazing,"This books is simply amazing. God totally led me to this book in the bookstore one day as I was waiting for a Bible to be embossed I decided to go look at the shelves again, and right in front of me was this book.As a single mom this book just overwheled and spoke healing to my heart. I also have When Women Overcome Life's Hurts. Cindi is an amazing writer!"
2,Not too useful,"This student solutions manual only includes the solutions that are already in the back of the book. Some of them give more explanation, but some of the confusing solutions only give the same answer as the textbook. It doesn't seem worth the expense if there isn't a lot to help me understand the process, how to solve problems."
1,I can't learn a damned thing from this book,"It may be better in an actual classroom setting where an instructor can help students work through solutions, but it's not so good in the class I have that is using it. Trying to self-study from this book is not very productive at all."
4,titanium,"Energizer batteries are alright, Duracell are about equal, if not slightly better with their new ultra batteries in certain high-tech devices. However, in a little while energizer will be releasing titanium batteries which last 85% longer. personally, I will wait and buy those batteries (unless I absolutely need the batteries now)."
1,These cost $10.00 with shipping!,"No kidding!! The shipping charge on these batteries was over $6.00. Amazon doesn't itemize the shipping charges on your order, so if you order multiple items, you won't know that you're being raped by Crutchfield until it is too late!!"
4,I Always Wanted To Write a Battery Review,"I used to buy Energizers and Duracells at $3-4 a pop for four batteries. Now I buy generic Alkalines at Costco. Cost: $8 for 10 four packs. It's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer. According to a recent coprehensive story in Consumer Reports, there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries."
2,An entertaining story is missing,"The authors had a good idea with this topic, but the stories are not engaging. The characters are not well-developed and the story is basically missing. Children this age (4-7) really need a story that is going to hold their attention. Also, there are many words per page, and the pictures are not detailed enough to capture children's interest while the adult reads through all the words. I think there must be other books which do a better job of discussing fears and worries without being so laborious and uninteresting."
2,Cheap plastic,"I'm sad because I had high hopes for using this as a cleanable rug for underneath my kitchen table. I thought it was going to feel different; I guess I'd describe it as looking like a plastic easter basket with very small weave. Also, the blue looked sort of slate blue online (and on its box!), but it's actually bright sky blue alternating with black. It looks tacky, I'll be honest. On the box, there's a picture of some people having a picnic on the beach with it and it would actually be great for that, or to use when camping as a giant mat. But I really don't think this can work in my apartment and I wish I hadn't bought it. Honestly, it looks like it should have cost $10. It comes in this huge box, though, so it might cost a lot to send back. I haven't decided yet. I could also give it to my mom to use in her backyard, I guess."
5,The perfect gift,"Get one for all your friends and family because otherwise they will forever be borrowing your copy! In the pages of this book I discovered there IS hope for our sad old earth. I've found a myriad of things I can do - everyday - to live more lightly and to help take care of this planet so there might possibly be something worth leaving to future generations. What Can I Do: An Alphabet for Living is tailored to internet users, but the you don't have to have a computer to enjoy the book. My mother, who doesn't own a computer, took possession of my copy a month ago.Guess what she'll be getting for her birthday?"
4,Nothing much new,"I was a little disappointed in this book, I thought it was a list of things to do. It was more like vague suggestions with web sites to check out. Several of the web sites were no longer working. I didn't find a lot of new information that I have not already read about. This is more of a beginners guide for going green. I would have gotten a lot more out of it several years ago. So if you are just starting to find options for going green, this is a book for you."
5,What Can I Do? An Alphabet for Living,This handy little book is a wealth of information for those of us interested in helping ourselves and our families live more wholesomely and also in connecting with a ready network of concerned companies who are at the cutting edge of reinstating respect for our wonderful planet and all its inhabitants.
4,UK Straw Men #2,"This is the UK version of The Upright Man, the sequel to The Straw Men, and #2 in the (so far) trilogy. There are differences between the texts of Lonely Dead and Upright Man, so an interesting comparison but not a ""whole new read."" Not as compelling as Straw Men, but certainly full of interesting twists, backstory and hints. Better than #3 (alas), which cries out for another sequel (and on and on)."
4,Great addition for Wahl clippers,"These work great on my Wahl Balding clippers, although I did have trouble fitting them on an older Wahl clipper.I like the color coding and the the little rack it comes in, but it should have the left/right over the ear attachments of the cheaper all black set. Would give five stars if it were not for the price."
3,Nice story Book for Kids,"This is written in prose form as opposed to Charles Schulz' comic strip style. Still, children will like it, especially if you read it to them. I read it to myself, and I liked it very much, and I'm no kid. This was purchased originally as a gift, but,instead, I think I'll gift myself with it."
4,Cute pet bed but sides are flimsy,"Both my Dachshunds fit in this together, the style is very cute, and is washes well, my only quirk with this bed, is that the sides fall down and it is not sturdy like the picture shows. Even from the first day , so it is not just from wear."
4,The dog loves it,"The very first time we put the bed down for her, she sniffed the bed all over, then settled right down in the bed.It is a great bed for our 22 pound pet."
3,Tommy Olivencia's third album for Inca Records.,"This classic album was Tommy's third release for Inca Records and features the winning combination of Chamaco Ramirez and Paquito Guzman on lead vocals. The big hits were the Guajira ""Historia De Un Condenado"", the Boleros ""Verdad Amarga"" and ""Mi Desgracia"", the Guaguancos ""Soy Dichoso"" and ""Cumbele Maina"" and the absolutely infectiously groovy Calypso ""Fire Fire In The Wire Wire"". Based on the music's overall quality and the production's strong values I would easily have given it a 5-star rating BUT the Fania (and affiliate labels') then-owners Sonido, Inc. transferred this album to CD from a vinyl record without removing the surface noise and the sound quality leaves much to be desired. Hopefully, Codigo Music Group (Fania's new owners) will someday reissue this album PROPERLY from the original master tapes."
4,I can not believe..........,"No one has reviewed this book? It is truly reflective of the style and peculiarity of a great chef. Charlie Trotter does not ever hold back in giving the customer great presentation, flavorful food, and the freshest ingredients you will find this side of Alain Ducasse. You can see and feel the influences of Joel Robuchon in this spectacular assemblage of what most chefs agree to be the worlds sexiest foods"
1,The demented creation of a madman,"Do you enjoy assembling 5,000 piece jigsaw puzzles blindfolded? Or have you ever built a fully-detailed model of the cathedral at Chartres with toothpicks? Then, my obsessive-compulsive friend, you have found your cookbook.Are you a food pervert? (You can be honest. It's just the two of us here.) Do your most sordid and lascivious fantasies revolve around duck breasts rather than human ones? Then bring this book home, lock the doors, and go nuts. (Just stay out of my neighborhood.)Are you a normal human being looking for some tasty recipes to prepare? Run away! Quickly!"
5,The Greatest Movie Composer of All Time,"John Williams is unarguably one of the best in the business of soundtracks, his uncanny ability to set the mood in any movie is unmatched. From the suspense of ""Jaws,"" to the soft sounds of ""ET,"" all the way to the pure inspirational tones of ""Duel of the Fates,"" Williams is a master. It is clearly apparent why George Lucas and Spielburg prefer his art in their movies. Get this CD, or any of his works, you shan't be displeased."
4,Just wish it was a bit louder,John Williams is amazing and the songs contained here are some of his greatest and most well known. The volume on the cd is a bit lower than some of my others so I find myself turning up the volume on these songs (and then back down on the other cds).
3,"Greatest Hits, but dissapointed quality","I am not going praise how good John Williams is, and how good these masterpieces are, because I am sure if you are reading this, you already know that.All I want to say is the quality of the recording. If you are looking for audiophile quality from this CD, you will be dissapointed. If you are playing this in your home theatre audiophile system, you will be dissapointed with the bland and flat output.I hope John William will remake this into Bluray (I would like to see his live performance!) and HD quality. It is about time too."
3,GOOD COLLECTION,"I SAY THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD COLLECTION OF JOHN WILLIAMS. IT STOPS AT 1999 AND SOME OF HIS RECENT STUFF IS EXCLUDED FROM THIS COLLECTION. I WAS GOING TO PURCHASE HIS ULTIMATE COLLECTION, BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND SOME OF HIS BEST TRACKS SUCH AS ""CADILLAC OF THE SKIES"" MISSING. I WOULD SAY THIS IS STILL A PRETTY GOOD BYE."
1,...,"I used to like Mr. Williams. His majestic score in Star Wars Trilogy simply blew me away. However, after twenty minutes of listening to this album, the only thing in my mind was pushing the stop the button. When you are listening to Superman, if you tell other people this is Star Wars, they might be convinced. Mr. Williams uses the same kind of music almost everytime and I got sick, sick of those loud, clamorous, annoying wind instruments which are much more disturbing than rap or rock music. To sum up, if you like Mr. Williams, don't buy this one."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"John Williams' music is so good that it is often the highlight of the otherwise excellent films that it accompanies. But it is usually dissappointing to me that I cannot fully appreciate the score with the movie running over it. That is why I was thrilled with the gift of this 2-CD set that my wife gave me today!To be able to just sit and really listen to this music is a wonderful treat in itself. The quality of the recordings are excellent and the selection could not have been better if I chose them myself. I look forward to many, many delightful hours of listening to this compilation."
5,Great movie music,Loved it!!! John Williams music is brilliant and this collection is one of the best out there. I highly recommend this for any movie fan.
5,music to my ears,"Some of the best and most memorable music! His music brings life to my heart and soul. I have listened to this CD several times now, and bought one as a gift for my son, since he also loves his music with the movies.Truly an amazing conductor!"
4,Great for the classroom.,"I bought this CD with several other soundtracks to play in my junior high classroom. Most songs are familiar to most students. If the class gets too loud, I have enough Star Wars and Indiana Jones fans that keep things in check. The songs that aren't known, like the ones from Amastad and Stepmom are still very appropriate for a working classroom."
5,Everything you never knew you could know about Green Tea!,"I picked up this book because I was looking for a source of ""recipes"" for soaps and other bad items using green tea, and was pleasantly surprised to find it's a veritable encyclopedia of information on green tea. I was already fairly well-versed in the various ""cultures"" of green tea in China and Japan, and the author does a nice job of summarizing this for the reader, including not just various ways to prepare it, but also giving a quick primer on the needed utensils. Finally, the green tea ice cream recipe is a keeper (though I cut the number of egg yolks from 3 to 5, and leave out the lemon rind, nutmeg, and half the vanilla which overpower the delicate green tea flavor). Great all-around book on a product that's as healthy as it is enjoyable."
4,Pretty Cool Resource,"Diana Rosen doesn't just talk about green tea here exclusively but adds a little about other kinds of true Camellia Sinensis teas too.But what I like best about this book is the cool beauty and household tips. For instance, did you know that you can use tea as an insect repellent for mosquitoes and moths?I thought I'd seen it all on the Internet but this book proves there's always more to learn about the wonders of tea."
3,This is Really Messy Stuff,"Foul smelling. Messy. It probably protects okay, but you'd better mask off all adjacent areas before spraying. Otherwise you'll have nasty purple gunk everywhere you don't want it. It is difficult to spray just the right amount in only the area you intend it to go. I expected it to dry or set up, but it's pretty runny and I don't think it ever sets up. Maybe that's what it's designed to do, but I had hoped for something less messy than petroleum jelly or grease products, but this isn't it."
4,Works well,"Seems to work well on my battery, easy to use and compact. Permatex is a good company and I have no qualms about using their products."
2,Looking for step-by-step? This isn't it.,"This book isn't nearly as methodical as the other ""Bible"" books. If you are a Photoshop beginner and want step-by-step instructions on how to create various effects, I'd tell you to look elsewhere. There are too many times you have to flip back to previous paragraphs or chapters and reference previous steps in order to continue with the present effect. Ever encounter the ""then a miracle occurs"" gap? There are plenty in this book. Too bad, because I usually like Deke's books."
5,Brilliant!,"The second season is my favorite but this is a grand ending to the three-year season. Sad, hilarious, wonderful and brilliant about theatre, success, and musical comedy! Cannot imagine we will have to do without a fourth season....perhaps THE TEMPEST?"
5,The ill duo continues...,"Did they continue to make your head nod on this second attempt? Yes! Are the beats just as good if not better? Yes! Every record they make is good. They have no competition, they're in a category of their own. They hold it down for all that appreciate dope hip hop music. Don't sleep, if you see it at the store buy it. It'll be one of your best purchases in a long time. Peace!"
2,Not Their Best !,"the anticipation couldn't be any worse I was really dissapointed when I heard this, I waited so long for this to come out and for what! to hear garbage! Ant needs to stop producing or start getting his $h?t together, they should have gotten grouch on production like on the first felt cd, dont get me wrong I love atmosphere and murs, but this is nothing compared to their old stuff if you really want to hear some real atmosphere listen to their sad clown series if you can find it and if you want to listen to some real murs listen to the end of the begening and murs 3:16 the 9th edition anyways do yourself A favor burn the cd first off the internet if you like it buy it if you don't then dont get it which I strongly reccomend..."
2,average,"this album doesnt live up to its hype,i will admit it was better than the first ""felt"".But the lack of good beats let this one down for me and ive grown quite sick of slug,which probably didnt help."
1,Imposters!!!!,There is already a band named FELT. We do these people get to use this name? Are there not laws against this? Yes I am a huge fan of of the band FELT. The UK band that began in late 70's and it makes me mad to see another group steal their name. Throw them in Jail!!!
4,Jeff Buckley In NZ,"Not as good as I expected, although my expectations are high on any Buckley product. In any event a must buy for any Buckley fan and I already have bought another for a friend. His material is timless and hauntingly beautiful. His version of Zep is quite funny. Jeff's songwriting is amazing and none of his records leave my player very long."
5,Time,"This album contains the best recording of ""The Twa Corbies"" I've ever heard. Chills went down my spine.""You Will Burn"" is a touch silly and I've always hated the song ""Old Maid in the Garret"", but what with all of the others here, two low points hardly matter. This is Steeleye Span in their hard-edged incarnation: there's little that is gentle or New Agey about this album -- thank god."
4,"Nice music, nothing more, nothing less","I think the title says it all and so do all the other reviewers here. Should I mention, too, that Cooper is one of the best vocalists today? I think not. It's already said. OK, I do :)"
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,The cover was grimy and the book had many highlighted passages. This was an unexpected disappointment.
5,"unbelievable book, eye opening","Mom here, this book will change your perspective, nothing I could write here would truly give it justice. Well worth the money, it'll stay on my book shelf till all the kids make it thru till marriage."
5,A Real Eye Opener for Parents and Grandparents,"How sad that children who, 50 years ago, would have still been playing dolls or cowboys and indians are now not just dabbling, but are fully involved in a secret, sexual life style. How it is wrecking parent/child relationships! I have witnessed this over and over as I work with young people."
3,smaller than expected,"I read the info before I bought the rug, but It seemed small when I recieved it. Know that it is in the nursery it looks really cute in fron of the crib!"
1,Visioneer Patriot 430 a headache and frustration....,"I had this scanner for less than a year and Visioneer has the worst technical support (may be on planet earth). For some reason, the scanner stops scanning in the middle of the first page, and there are no solutions. I installed the software and drivers on a new dell PC, and it came up with the same error. I bought atleast 12 scanners from visioneer directly, and I'm not buying this brand anymore for my company."
4,"well written, but lack suspense","This twelve-story anthology loosely focuses on the title, MURDER IN THE FAMILY. Though the tales are well written, they lack the suspense and cutting edge expected of this famous group of popular authors that contributed to the collection and that of previous short story books produced by the Adams Round Table. For most mystery readers, previous Adams Round Table editions are stronger (see MURDER AMONG FRIENDS, etc.). However, die hard fans of Lawrence Block, Mary Higgins Clark, Stanley Cohen, Dorothy Salisbury Davis, Mickey Friedman, Joyce Harrington, Susan Isaacs, Judith Kelman, Warren Murphy, Justin Scott, Peter Straub, and Whitley Strieber will want to read the tales. Yet even the strongest of loyalists need to keep the expectations a bit lower than usual as the gaggle of writers fall short of what each one usually provides.Harriet Klausner"
3,"Good looks, reasonable performance","The product was easy to install and generally looks good. Couple of disappointments were that (a) the caddy to hold the hand-held shower-head is too short and too close to the wall-mount shower-head, and (b) the flexible host for the hand-held shower-head is not long enough to extend far from the wall. The host does not look very sturdy and time will tell how well it holds up. The water pressure in the shower head is ok, but not very forceful."
1,"Good product, low priced","The dual shower head and secondary shower wand was easy to installl and works great. It is nice to have the versatility of both heads. The order came quickly, was well packaged and included easy-to-follow instructions."
1,Useless - Take it from an HLS Student,"A friend of mine had a copy of this book, which I recently looked through. I can assure you that nothing you glean from this book is going to make it easier for you to get into law school. Admissions at Harvard are pretty straightforward - they look at your LSAT score, GPA, and then any extracurricular and work experience you have.You want to get into HLS? Work hard in undergrad, get top-notch grades, look into some interesting internships, and consider enrolling in an LSAT preparatory course. Other than that, the only advice I can give you is to get your applications in as early as possible in the admissions cycle."
1,Obsolete; useful for students who wanted to get into HLS 10 years ago!,"Out-of-date information. People have become much more competitive these days. Irrespective of whether you go to Tufts, Cornell or Yale, you can't expect to get in HLS with 3.25-3.5 GPA and 80th percentile on LSAT."
2,Better look elsewhere,"If you're looking for serious assistance on getting into one of the most selective programs in the world, this is not the right book. The author is obviously quite taken with his school, but I could have done without the dissertation on the drawbacks of student housing and more detailed information on the admissions process. ""Step 1...Step 2..."" may have been too simplistic an approach but this book does not offer any insight at all. Instead, it offers the words of a large group of rather egotistical, self-congratulatory Harvard law students who, according to them, all knew without a doubt they were going to be admitted because of their fabulous grades. I already knew grades were important. I was looking for some other information and it was not in this book."
2,Unhelpful and frequently off-purpose,"I found the book less a guide to admission to HLS than a general portrait of the school and its students. Though applicants to HLS might find such a portrait of some use, the book falls far short of its aim to show readers ""How to Get Into HLS."" Speaking as one who was admitted and who knows students there, I can say that there is no book the reading of which will turn one's chances of admission: the decision is made largely on the basis of the numbers, as other guide books will state."
3,Useful but elitist,"Read the personal statements to get a feel for caliber your personal statement should measure up to. Use personal profiles of creme de la creme top-tier-school applicants to guage how you compare. My opinion- this book is worth buying if you can get it used at a discounted price as a reference for your applications, just as a bit of side reading, good-to-know kind of stuff as you are applying to top law schools. Definitely would NOT recommend spending full price on this."
3,Gotta love Dick's Automotive!,CD is a little short in content but makes up for this with 2 outstanding tracks. Dick's Automotive and Sesame Street are absolute gems. Well wort a listen and you won't be disappointed.
5,the secret teachings of plants,This book is brilliiant and written by a poet from the heart - I have already recommended to many friends
1,not worth it,mr buhner turns a good story but if your look for how to are real info this book is not for you
3,Competent.,This is a competently written and brutal story of the corruption of a good man under a hideous system. It wasn't at all fun to read; it was believable.
2,Too Bloody and Violent for Words; Really Twisted,"Whoever dreamed up this story line needs psychiatric help. If you want to read about people having their fingernails ripped out, and being tortured to death, this is the book for you. The author appears to know way too much about torture; makes me wonder about her mindset. Rather than donate this book (my normal practice) it is going in the trash. The only reason it got two stars rather than one is that I finished the book - good character development so I had to see it through to the end."
1,Repellent and dishonest,"I thought this book was one of the most dishonest works I have ever read. If I could have given this 0 stars, I would have. I have no problem with the concept that someone can become ""addicted"" to wielding power over someone. However, everyone around this character (except for the ""really bad people"") comes to love, respect and admire him, even those whom he has tortured, even those who are enslaved to him. HE is, apparently, the tormented one. Much is made of him not being able to refuse to become a torturer. Rubbish -- he is a man of wealth and privilege. All he has to do is give up some of his privilege and rebel against daddy. Oh no! Can't do that! Must torture people instead. And they must love me for it! This book left a disgusting taste in my mouth."
2,A slow agonizing read,I had high hopes for this book and they were quickly dashed. I don't like books that have such complex ridiculous names that you cannot pronounce nor remember them. NOTHING HAPPENS except the main character learning to torture people. You the reader will be tortured too. What does the picture on the cover have to do with the story? I would not recommend this book.
1,Awkwardly written to the point of outrage by the reader.,"Unrelenting exploration of institutional pain and those trained to deliver it. The Author needs an editor who can delete enough words in the sentences to make them flow. An example--the character takes a ""wet shower""--really is there a dry one? The main character is so noble you want to throw up. Its a hard read because the author can't just state something. Sometimes I had to read a sentence three times to get its meaning. She needs to study Hemingway. A boring book and hard to read. Can I get my money back?"
5,torture makes a science fiction book more interesting !,"I found this book hiding in my library and i couldn't put it down until i was finished with it 5 hours later. This book is one of those rare oddities that enthrall you with the idea that no matter what the conditioning the aptitude to become a monster is in all of us. Andrej is in a breed all his own located somewhere in the twisted potential of science fiction. His relationships with his slaves was the most interesting part of the story, when they were not being discussed in parts of the chapter i had an intense anticipation for when i would see them again. I particularly enjoyed the ""i love you, Spartacus"" scenes if you catch my drift. I only wish that there were more of these homoerotic innuendos. I love this book and i eagerly await the sequel. P.S. if people are so remiss about Andrej's behavior, its probably because they felt guilty about enjoying the torture scenes. I liked them."
4,Didn't think I would like it but...,"When I started reading this book, I had no idea at all what it was about. Upon discovering that it dealt with a torturer-in-training, I began to lose interest. But then I picked it up again. And again. Though the subject matter is difficult to stomach at times, it is interesting. To use highly trained medical professionals as torturers seems a bit odd, but it makes sense if you take it in context. All the better to keep them alive with, my dear. I find Andrej to be a very interesting character, and I just loved Joslire. I found myself wanting for more from his point of view. And Noycannir sure was evil to the core.... Still, I have a couple of lingering questions. I want to know more about this universe that Matthews has created. I want to know more about the interrelationships of the species, and about some of the issues hinted at in this book - shortages of grain, for instance. This could be an interesting series... I intend to read on."
2,"It started off well, but...","If you've read this far down the page, you don't need more plot synopses. The lead character is fascinating and very well portrayed and the storyline is dark, but I like that, very much.Unfortunately, the book doesn't pay off. There is little external conflict that isn't resolved quickly and with minimal consequences. The characters who stand in opposition to the lead are impotent or too removed from the story to effectively threaten him.And the end is soft. Unbelievably soft. It's not just that the end of the story is the opening for a sequel, with the jerk of the piece promising to do something nasty (finally) in the next book. It's that the conflicts of the book are dispelled with as much effort as a pile of dustballs.The only abiding conflict of the book is an internal one: How can I enjoy committing this brutality; what kind of a jerk am I? A little of this goes a long way.I'll read Susan Matthews again, maybe after she leaves the torturer story behind."
2,Based on a complete teardown and rebuild (Bah)!,"The images are vauge and the troubleshooting trees are far from complete. Sure it's better than nothing but don't try to troubleshoot any serious electrical problems with this manual. I tried to troubleshoot a surge between 700 and 900 when stopped at idle. It sounds nasty. I think the knock sensor is the only thing keeping my engine from dieing. I think I narrowed it down to the map/intake air temp sensor (no help from this book though). Sheesh, Haynes used to be a great series of manuals. It looks like they've gone cheap."
3,Do these manuals seem to be shrinking with indepth coverage?,It seems like these manuals are just not as in dept as they once were. Whatever.
5,the best cd!,"when i bought the fiona apple cd, i wasnt sure how it was gonna sound, but as soon as i actually heard it, i was hooked! i havent been able to get it out of my cd player, and my sis is always fighting me to be able to listen to it. i seriously recomend this to ya, its the best cd ive had in a while!"
5,Magnificent,"This is a truly maginficent album, much better than TIDAL, and that's saying quite a lot. It's unfortunate that Amazon only offers samples of the first five songs on the album -- it's the last five that are the best, especally ""The Way Things Are"" and ""Get Gone."""
5,Great!,This was my first time purchasing something from Amazon.com and it was very simple. This CD was in great condition and the shipping was quick!
5,Fiona has given us a gift...,"that I will always cherish...psychedelic music! Despite her infamous incoherant ramblings at numerous awards shows (you know what I talking about)Fiona is one of the most talented artists in modern day music. I read a review of this album in JANE magazine, and the critic gave it one star. Um...I don't understand what that BS is about, but this is a great album...read the lyrics and each time you will see the music. And, I'm not getting paid to say it. I just wanna spread the richness of Fiona's gift!"
3,Fiona Makes The Fans Work,"""When The Pawn..."" is similar to Fiona Apple's debut in one respect; After one listen, I don't care for it at all. And that can only mean that--like Tidal--this is destined to become one of my favorite albums. Congratulations to Apple for making a CD that won't burn out the listener after 4 or 5 plays. She's going to make you work for it...but, trust me, it's going to be worth every minute."
4,well worth the wait.......,"Fiona Apple has a great voice and listening to this second effort everything about her is really brought out to shine. Very crisp, and very different music than what young people her age are into, but that's what makes her music special to me. Her music takes you places that a dance/rap number will never go."
4,Promising follow-up to 'Tidal',"This is not what I had expected from the artist that gave us the radio-hit 'Criminal'. There doesn't seem to be an obvious single here, but each one of these songs hints at the maturation of a rising performer, both lyrically and melodically. Alright, so she still sings about bad relationships and former boyfriends. It's that with such wonderful songs as 'Love-Ridden,' and the bouncy 'The Way Things Are,' you could almost forgive her self-indulgence. She's gets away with it this time, but it's a transgression that won't be over-looked the next time round."
5,love it,"another wonderful album from fiona. If you liked 'tidal' at all, you should have no problem with this one. Very easy to listen to, moves straight through to the end without any bumps. 'When the Pawn' takes off with a faster, less sullen tempo than the first album, but it still has plenty of moodiness. Although some of the songs do sound fairly similar to each other, there aren't any that I don't like, and plenty that I do like. And Fiona does have that voice that one can't very easily forget (if you haven't heard her yet, take the time to listen to some of the soundclips--or borrow a copy from a friend)."
4,Fiona's Derring-do,"This is the real deal. Fiona Apple's debut album ""Tidal"" was an impressive start, but this second album ""When the Pawn..."" truly rattles the mind and commands artistic agility. Fiona's confidence shines through, and she sings in a voice at once fierce and startlingly vulnerable. Songs like ""Paper Bag"" and ""Get Gone"" are especially masterful, but the whole album remains strong with every listen."
4,Fiona takes a step beyond...from amazing to brilliance,"Fiona's second work provides many a tortured, but hopeful framework. The first single ""Fast As You Can"" with its tempo-shifting chameleonesque sound, only hints at the aural diversity of this work. From ""On The Bound"", the driving piano-drenched opener, to ""I Know"", the album's closer, each song plays like its own symphony. Each and every one leaves perfectly open the doors of parallel, where one can see his/her own life reflected in the lyrics. Exceptionally striking is the vehement ""Limp"" which builds to a strong, pounding chorus that shouts out to the listener and then drops back to mid-volume for the next verse each time. The rest only expand on such ever-changing uses of instrumentation and voices. Would have given 5 if not for some songs that seem to repeat instrumentally too much in the end. Even so, this doesn't take away the impact they have. As always, listen and decide for yourself. :)"
5,Fiona is an artistic genius.,"Fiona Apple is an artistic genius. I love this album for it's depth, honesty, poetry, and intensity of spirit. The way Fiona's voice cracks at the end of the song, I Know, is hearbreaking. And the way Fiona compairs one way love with anorexia in the song Paper Bag is ingenius. I wish there were more artists like this out there on the scene today. Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Corinna Fugate, and Vanessa Carlton stand as one of a kind songwriters. I hope they release Fiona Apple's new CD soon! I will be the first to buy it! Free Fiona!"
4,What a great experience!,"This album is a must-have for everybody who loves non-conventional, bright, strong and smart singers (females) like Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan. Good melodies, good rythms, you'll sing on this album after two times you listen to it. Nothing too commercial like Spears, Lopez, Carey, etc. I just recommend it. Like a fresh wave of power in your hears!"
5,Fiona's roots,"I loved this album, and so will you. After hearing it, I was immediately reminded of another female vocalist/songwriter called Laura Nyro. She was also young when, in 1968, her first and undoubtebly best album, ""Eli and the Thirteenth Confession"" was released. I would like to take this opportunity to reccomend that album to anyone who seriously enjoys the music of Fiona Apple. Laura Nyro is perhaps a step above, for while she can bring out her melancholy to a point that is goosebump rendering for the listener, she also made songs that were simply a joyous celebration of life and love. Fiona Apple tends to dwell only on the darker moments in her life. So, anyway, for lyrics that pull and push you to a beautiful climax, and for melodies that are sure to brighten any cloudy day, I totally and whole-heartedly recommend ""Eli & the Thirteenth Confession"" by Laura Nyro."
4,Great Follow-up,"This is a great album. Personally, it doesn't touch me quite as much as Tidal does, but it is, nonetheless, wonderful. Her lyrics are beautiful and INCREDIBLE (perhaps even better than those on tidal) and she's definitely done some growing since 1996. ""love ridden"", ""get gone"", ""paper bag"" and ""i know"" are my personal faves. if you loved tidal, it may take a while to get used to When the pawn's new style, but soon you will LOVE it. 2 thumbs up, great family fun. ps, if you don't already own tidal, BUY IT. i'm not kidding. (and listen to ""never is a promise"", track 7)"
4,Beautiful lyrics and music,"After reading reviews on Amazon and downloading a few songs, I decided to buy both of her CD's. And I was not disappointed! Fiona Apple has the most beautiful and insightful lyrics that one can listen to again and again.""I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy""- Paper BagBoth her CD's are excellent, and although I do love a lot of the songs on Tidal, this one is overall a better CD. However if you enjoy music which reaches into you and makes you think, give these a try. Beautiful, haunting and definately worth hitting repeat for"
3,Ok follow-up,"Fiona Apple's a great singer/songwriter, but there's something missing from this album. her first was so good that I could listen to it over and over, but this one barely gets played. Too bad. She's brilliant."
2,"It's only ""Eh...""","If you liked the first Fiona album, then you'll like this one. But all the songs on this album sound exactely the same: Fiona sings, then the piano comes in; Fiona sings over the piano obviously about some boy who dumped her because she's too skinny for her own good; Fiona stops singing and there's the piano again.If you're into regularity, this is for you..."
3,Much of it sounds like an Aimee Mann retread,"I'm mystified why this CD is getting such rave reviews. The strongest single is Limp, which is fantastic, and may be worth getting the CD for. The rest of it sounds an awful lot like Aimee Mann - to an embarrassing degree. Its kinda unfocused and imitative...sounds like a junior album."
5,5 stars PLUS,"When the Pawn... is an utterly breathtaking follow-up to Tidal. I loved Tidal, as others have said, it's mature beyond Fiona's years at that time. I cannot stress enough that if you appreciate moody music and lyrics to fit most any person's feelings before, during and after a relationship, then this is the cd for you.Even if you appreciate excellent lyrics as a whole. Case in point:... and then the dove of hope began it's downward slope and I believed for a moment that my chances were approaching to be grabbed, but as it came down near so did a weary tear I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bagHave you been there or what? That's from Paper Bag and let me tell you, it's just the tip of the iceberg.Buy it, own it, love it."
5,A Masterpiece,"Fiona's second CD is one of the best that I've ever heard. While her first CD, Tidal, was very good it wasn't perfect, When The Pawn, however, is flawless! This CD is so good I can't pick a song I like the most. They're ALL good. I think it's safe to say Fiona Apple is one of this era's most important singer/song writers. A pure joy."
5,16 year old metal head.,I cannot say enough good thing's a about fiona and this CD. out of my music library (ranging from Beethoven to slayer) this is the best album I own. I lessen to it every day. if I had a to chose an album to lessen to for an Eternity this would be it.You will not be disappointed i definitely know im not.
4,Fiona Comes Through Again.,"I was a huge fan of Fiona Apple's first effort, Tidal. Her voice is amazing, and the arangements and song writing on that album suggest she was much older than she actually was. Somehow Ms. Apple has managed to become an even better vocalist. She still has the angelic lilt, tainted with the singe of lost innosence. But now she has added a stronger understanding of what she can do with her voice, and how to present her lyrics. The result is another album that conceals the relative youth of the artist. Fiona, as an artist, has the soul of someone at least twice her age, and the talent to make it work. This is a great album."
3,When the pawn,"I really adorded tidal. Not only was it the most imaginative debut of 96, but one of the best album's of the decade. So heart stoppingly beautiful, dreamy and wistful, did i ever stop playing it? So 3 years on and an anxious wait for her fans, we get a follow-up, which is in itself good and versatile, yet lacks that beauty that made her first album so appealing. Fiona is still unknown in the UK, despite my efforts to tell everyone about tidal, but I feel this album will not help bring her into the limelight over here. She is amazing, and those lyrics,well...., so it's just a pity that those tunes aren't as memorable. Pity!"
1,Did you like her first CD? Then don't buy this one.,"Like many, if not most, of the people who bought this CD, I was hoping for something like her absolutely brilliant first album. It was disappointing to find that she'd hit the usual musician's sophmore slump, producting an album that contains none of the bluesy, hard-edged beauty of her previous effort. I've already given the CD away, as I had no desire to hear it again.She does have an awesome track on the 'Plesantville' sound track, though!"
1,Vastly overrated,"I don't know who the people leaving all these ""she's a genius"" reviews here, but let me tell you, this album is a huge disappointment. I bought the album lured primarily by the glowing reviews, and I feel cheated.The music is neither melodic nor touching, instead she produces a cocophany of loud noise and hopes her fans will see it as a ""wonderfully elaborate arrangement"".The vocals are unremarkable, the composition is mediocre, and the lyrics are hardly poetic. This is just another singer riding high on the hype generated by her record label."
1,"Derivative boring style, she lacks vocal range and talent",Sorry I'm not the average American music fan who is impressed with pseudo talents. Is she a black soul singer or just trying to be one who cops a style to be viewed as a real talent. Bought the first album and tired of it quickly. This apple chick is about as deep as a parking lot puddle whether or not her album title is 90 words long.
5,Fiona is extraodinary!!!!,"I loved this album just as much as I love Tidal..They are both exceptional albums..Personally I cant say which is better because I love them both..And I must be crazy because I love the album title..I thought it was cool that she used a poem to ""title"" her album..As a songwriter myself, I constantly look for people who stretch the boundaries of word usage to create great works of art, no matter what anyone else thinks..She is a great singer but her songwriting is unparelleled...If you like her, pick up both albums, you will get something from each..."
5,i'd give it six stars if i could,"fiona is one of the few artists that can write AND sing. she's a pure talent who you can tell puts her all into her work. truely thoughtful and thought-provoking.i loved her debut album, and i'm in love with her sophomore album. whenever she releases her third album, i'll preorder it. there's no need to wait for the first single so see if i like it, because i'm sure i'll absolutely LOVE it."
4,A very good second effort,"this album seems to take more time to get used to than Tidal, but if you can listen to it a few times, you'll realize that it is quite good. Same types of songs, yet there has been some growth. This fulfills my need for a Fiona Apple album for a while. I hope she puts out a new one as fast as she can."
3,Finding a Voice,"One of the most interesting singer-songwriters out there, Fiona Apple follows her debut ""Tidal"" with this worthwile, well-accomplished release. Although a bit too short, this is a fine album, intense and captivating enough to deserve some repeated listens.These are personal bitterswet love songs, performed by a unique voice whose talent keeps growing. The lyrics and song structures are edgy and creative, a lot better than most of the stuff edited by some more mainstream ""divas"".The shining moments include ""To Your Love"", ""The way Things Are"" and the catchy single ""Fast As You Can"", where Apple mixes pop and jazz in a more innovative way than, say, the overrated Norah Jones. Fiona Apple is a girl worth watching, as she will probably release great things in the future. This is a good, hypnotic set of songs from a promising alternative-mainstream star."
4,THE APPLE HAS (FINALLY) RIPENED,"The Apple has finally ripen. Fiona Apple has finally settled down, left her underwear, undernourished and oversexed look back in he bedroom. It's a ""Criminal"" act we welcome. On this follow-up to her debut CD, Fiona voice is husky and heartfelt; she ignites torch songs with a jazzy flame --- made even more riveting by the bare-bones, yet atmospheric, orchestrations. The songwriter is (almost) as wordly and wonderous as the singer. And just as delicious."
2,'Not bad...but not as good as 'Tidal',"I think Fiona put everything into 'Tidal' and didn't have as much spark left for this album. Musically, probably a better work, but not nearly as attention getting as 'Tidal'...songs lack 'hook'...Couldn't turn 'Tidal' off....couldn't listen to ""In the Dawn..."" in one sitting. Still interesting, just not FUN."
4,A big sound from a young talent,"I can't say I'm the biggest Fiona Apple fan in the world, because she is a bit of an acquired taste for some, but her second album really impresses much as her debut record did. When you see her on t.v you don't expect the deep husky, soulful and sometimes angry voice to spring forth from such a slender young woman, but Fiona's talent will assure her a record deal as long as she wants to keep making records. Her music may not be typical ""radio"" friendly music, but for music lovers who appreciate good lyrics,good vocals and carefully crafted arrangements and songs, this artist is one to keep an ear out for!"
4,Even better than Tidal,"Those of you who loved 'Tidal' must get 'When the Pawn!' The new album is much more versatile and varied than Fiona Apple's debut album. Many more potential hits than 'Tidal.' What stands out to me in Fiona Apple's work is her poetry. To me, it greatly rivals Jewel's work in that Apple's poetry is more simplistic with just as great an emotional impact. And second, Apple's poetry is so intwined with her style of music. This is a fantastic piece of musical art!"
5,A Masterpiece,"I just bought the CD and I am in love with it esp. the songs GET GONE and A MISTAKE, but overall the entire collection is worth buying. If you loved Tidal, you'll also love When The Pawn."
4,Fiona Channels Lennon On This One,"Some of the songs are surely too Tori Amos-y for listeners who avoid that kind of music, but ""On The Bound"" is just one of those truly intoxicating songs that you can listen to over and over again. A Beatles influence is hard to ignore, but that's a good thing (given the number of artists who yearly attempt to copy the sound of Lennon/McCartney, the fact that she is able to create a song so entirely moving is truly remarkable). Anyone would do well to hear this song in its entirety and marvel at its scope and melodic force."
5,an electic fresh album,"though fiona has been one outspoken gal-controversial in her beliefs- this album speaks of a vital human being just trying to keep herself sane- and in expressing it she comes out with a beautiful mix of songs that connect with people to and fro. Most of the album has a rhythm edge- throwing in some hip hop beats, to the recent rock-ani difranco rhythms which is not the normal tap yer feet kind of music. It's an intelligent introspective album which has only sPAWNED her further into a well-rounded musician."
4,Durable goods,"I pulled ""Pawn"" out of my bookcase the other day and was surprised (again) how much I enjoyed it. Unlike the spotty ""Tidal,"" this CD should be heard in its entirety. There's no breakout single; the songs are equally strong and slip easily from one to the next. It's like an hour-long phone call with your best friend: conversational, honest, and punctuated with bursts of angst and knowing laughter. And she's so relaxed. You can see her dragging on a cigarette between verses. There's some real heft in the arrangements, giving the songs a rock strut without disturbing the intimate mood. Highly listenable. This girl is for REAL."
2,Adequate sophomore attempt,"I'm one of those that was totally entranced by ""Tidal"" when it came out; the sensous bad-girl-who-thinks-too-much growling on that cd along with some innovative song-writing made me listen to that cd over and over. This one didn't exactly jump out at me with anything new. The beats and harmonies are pretty much standard and the song-writing isn't as innovatively transcendent. Yet her lyrics are still profoundly wicked and vulnerable. Still though, without the musical ""edge"" that Tidal had , this one just didn't get my cd player repeat performance over and over..."
4,This cd is good,"Fiona Apples new cd ""When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'Fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, 'Cuz You'll Know That You're Right"" is a good cd. I think that the best song is ""Fast as you can."" If you like Fiona Apple, buy the cd."
2,"Tries hard to break new ground, but fails... boring","Fiona's young seductive look, deep voice and piano bar tunes may have bought her fame with Tidal, but in truth this album is just a repeat.Sure we get some new sounds, but they aren't good enough to make this effort stand out, and if it weren't for her age and striking looks, her last effort would have never made it.Criticism aside, Fiona writes good lryic, it's just her unfiminate voice, limited vocal range and limited style range that hurt her. Take a song like the first single ""Fast As You Can"", on first couple of listens the song sounds fresh, after a few you notice the the song shifts between two very different patterns, but we still get repitition as the whole song kind of loops, this same pattern can be found in all the other songs, some brilliant lryic writing prevents this album from being an entire flop."
2,just like jewel-exactly,"depressing, dependent songs. it is that reason that i leaned away from jewel (besides the fact that her voice got very cry-baby), and so i will lean away from Fiona. a far cry from a terrific tidal wave, a weak release. so get away from it 'fast as you can'"
5,THREE talents? Lucky lucky girl!,"It occurred to me as I drove in to work today listening to this CD for the umpteenth time, that if Fiona Apple were ""just"" able to play the piano as well as she does, or ""just"" had a deep sultry voice, or ""just"" wrote amazing lyrics/poetry, she would be incredible enough, but this girl has been blessed with three IMMENSE talents which, when put together yield the wonderful album that ""When the Pawn..."" is. I would be happy to be able to just one of the things she does so well. BUY THIS CD!"
4,New Queen of the alternative female vocalist.,"Fiona Apple takes over the crown of best alternative female vocalist, after Kate Bush got on our nerves, Jane Sibery went country, sinead O'Connor went off the wall and Tori Amos got wierd and repetitive.Apple's words are deep and her music is fantastic. And it is the music that is important.What is surprising is to see critics rave about her second album. Usually, when critics discover an artist, they usually like to tear apart the second effort."
5,"A Poet, a Talent, a Wonderful Album","I fell in love with Fiona Apple after hearing her Tidal CD, and reading the truly inspired and complex lyrics. I worried that the follow up album might not be able to live up to the first, and that perhaps Tidal was a fluke.....my worries were for nothing. It blows my mind that someone so young can write words that reach into you and grab at the feelings thoughts, and emotions that we all feel at any given time but cannot BEGIN to put into words. My God, I would love to meet this girl and spend an afternoon talking with her, but barring that, I will settle (quite contentedly) for listening to her music over and over again, until my husband threatens (as he did when I played out Tidal) to crush the CD if I don't ease up on it. I look forward - even at this early date- to Ms. Apple's next album. ""When the Pawn.."" is absolutely wonderful."
5,Flawless...,"Flawless, flawless, flawless. To the 4 out of 73 people that have since ""reviewed"" this effort, LISTEN. You owe it to yourself to immerse yourself in the lushness of ""When the pawn...""; try it again, you will not be sorry."
5,Fiona Apple: When the Pawn...,"I must say this CD has impressed me more than any other Fiona Apple Cd I have ever heard. I think in her new CD she put alot more of herself into it. I apriciate how many more instruments she used (drums, strings, piano)."
4,An up and coming artist,"But I don't want to lavish too much praise on an artist with tremendous talent and potential who still has a ways to go.The album is a very good one although not exceptional. I commend Miss Apple for her creativity and originality more than anything else. Her sound is unique (something sorely lacking in todays pop music world). A combination of funk, folk, and rock her music intrigues you. And I really like the fact that harmonically she is far from traditional incorporating sounds that are stark, full of irony and contrast.A definite purchase but not quite there yet."
5,Amazing,"I fell in love with Fiona Apple the first time I heard her in concert in 1997, just after Sleep to Dream came out (and possibly Criminal; time gets fuzzy 15 years ago). I went out and bought Tidal the next day. I was a little late to the party in picking up this one and Extraordinary Machine, but clearly I'm an easy sell on her works, and Tidal was going to be hard to follow. Miss Fiona does not disappoint. I routinely put it into my car's CD player and let it cycle over and over. There's a different sound to this one, while sounding just like her. I hesitate to say a maturity, but perhaps a degree of control. Even my less favored songs have a rare depth and beauty and they touch my heart in spite of themselves. Looking forward to hearing her latest."
5,1999's greatest record,"Wow. Fiona Apple outdoes herself on When The Pawn. With the help of super-talented producer and multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion, Fiona Apple has made a truly wonderful pop album. Forget what you thought about this artist based on her first release. This one shows incredible growth in both the music and the songwriting. There is nothing negative to report about this collection of songs. I can't listen to it enough. Rickie Lee Jones beware: you may have met your match with Fiona Apple. Let's see what she's doing ten years from now. Be sure to catch her live - you'll be blown away."
5,The best that I've bought in a while,"This album is sultry, introspective, angry at times (Limp), gentle at other (I Know), but never flakey. If you're bored of the same standard pop tunes that are played on the radio today, you might want to sample this album.I think that her voice takes a little getting used to at first. And you have to really listen to the songs to appreciate the honesty in the lyrics and the plays in rhythms and melodies. This isn't background music. But if you give it your attention, it'll definitely hook you."
4,Wow..what angry but profound young lady,"I would just like to say that I think Ms Fiona Apple is quite the songwriter. Her first album was amazing and I was hooked when I heard the bass line from ""Sleep to Dream"" from Tidal. However her sophomore release is blowing me away. I got the CD for my B-day(1-8-00) and I haven't stopped playing it since. My favorite songs are ""Limp"" "" Get gone"" and Paper bag"". While her voice may not be technically the greatest, it invokes something you don't hear too much from today's female singers;that is these are her songs and she is going to sing them whether you like it or not. I am so glad she did not hit that sophomore slump like a lot of artists. I really hope she does not get burned out. She needs to keep making good music"
5,More than fulfills the promise of Tidal,"This CD is both thematically coherent (without repeating itself!) and musically brilliant. Fiona's sophomore effort shows much more focus than her wonderful first, as well as more musical and lyrical sophistication. Every song on this album is great, but I especially love ""Paper Bag,"" ""Limp"" and ""Love Ridden,"" which rivals ""Never Is a Promise"" (from Tidal) for its world-weary beauty. This album has been the soundtrack to the last few months of my life."
5,"Little Lady with Big, Luscious Voice","Well, that just about does it! This ""Pawn"" record is so amazing that it makes me feel like I've wasted my money on the 50 other CDs I bought last year. Fiona Apple is the true stuff. She has really got it going on. Her lyrics make you shiver and her music makes you feel like you missed your calling in life. Truly phenomenal songwriting and musicianship. If you buy one record this year, let it be this one twice! One for your FRIENDS that I know you are going to let borrow and one for YOU when you realize it's just not worth the time apart."
4,Fierce Maturity,"The inital listening of WHEN THE PAWN... reveals an anger that has developed since the recording of TIDAL. However, the adoption of more upbeat and aggressive tempos make WHEN THE PAWN... mark an unexpected and strangely addictive direction change from Fiona that parades the emotional maturity of TIDAL with less of the hazy jazz vibes from that record. From the shrill exuberance of All I Need to the highly inventive pitching style of Fast As You Can, Fiona has allowed her influences to serve as proof to the considerable talent that she possesses and subsequently, WHEN THE PAWN...screams at the listener to pay attention to the considerable lyrical ability of this amazing young woman. My favourite track is the cover of the Beatles' ACROSS THE UNIVERSE (Best cover ever). No better than TIDAL, no worse. Just different. Not sure about the (full) title though."
5,Dear Fiona...,"Angry. Depressing. Sad. But full of raw emotion and heart-breaking lyrics. Fiona Apple knows how to get her voice heard. Her sophmore album is nothing less than beautiful and honest. Take a listen to dreamy lyrics of ""Paper Bag"" and the anger injected into ""Get Gone"" and you might begin to understand the world of Miss. Apple. Fiona is a talented, powerful performer who is just waiting to capture you..."
5,Just gets better...,"With Tidal being such a strong debut, it was hard to imagine what Apple would dish out next. When The Pawn... is everything Tidal was but more refined. Pretty much what one would anticipate but hardly expect. Her lyrics thankfully haven't softened, ie: Limp, and the album as a whole is a well-rounded production. Looking forward to hear what Ms Apple comes up with next..."
5,when the pawn...,"there are no words to describe the pure genius that is fiona apple. i think both ""tidal"" & ""when the pawn..."" are the only albams that i own that i could listen to over & over & over again & never get sick & tired of. fiona's writing, singing, producing, & instumental playing is all amazing. it is a true shame that such a talented artist, such as fiona, is highly overlooked by critics & the most of the public, who believe she just some angry nusance. they don't understand her. i love every single track on ""when the pawn..."" i couldn't pick a favorite.they say that the best artist are ignored & are never truly appreciated until they're long gone, i believe this will be the case for fiona."
3,fiona's bummed,i thought tidal was much better this a good disc w/ some good beats but its depressing and she puts more of her heart and soul into this album but theres something about tidal that makes that one a better cd
2,Once Sultry Now Just a Broken Heart,"I was a big fan of Tidal and I pretty much liked ""Fast as You Can"" when I heard it, but the rest of the album is just a bunch of sad break up songs that really have no real depth. With simple metaphors and overrated similes. And grasping on to new singles that just don't hold their own won't make this album anymore of a success than it already is."
2,Aimee Mann retread,"The album is OK and that's about it - one really good song (Limp) but the rest really, really sounds like an Aimee Mann imitation. I found this album disappointing. If I wanted to hear Aimee Mann I'd get a copy of it"
2,let down...,"Ok, its been a long time since this album was released, but I was looking over some of my favs today on amazon (Tidal being one of them) and I couldn't believe the reviews people are giving this. Now I'm just as hard core Apple fan as anyone, but this album was such a let down after the deep emotion that she gave us in the Tidal album. Its like she tried to go more main stream and up beat... but anyone that loved Tidal doesn't go to Fiona for up beat... we want deep feeling, something that makes us reflect upon ourselves. This just doesn't deliver."
4,In-depth treatment of bipolar transistors...,"Excellent treatment of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) physics in a very tutorial, readable style. Covers many topics in a lucid, intuitive and insightful manner, such as space-charge limited currents, surface recombination velocity, and ohmic contacts, where the discussions are a large cut above other introductory texts. Also covers MOSFETs and PN junctions, but nothing unusual here. There is little information on heterojunctions, optical and microwave devices. Overall, it is the ""light"" version of an earlier work ""Transistors"" by Warner and Grung, Wiley, 1983."
5,Great,"All the songs were perfect. Possesion, Ride Forever, and Henry Martin were among my favorites. Cabin Music was exceptional. I don't usually care for guitars, but I found it very enjoyable. I find myself listening to this CD two and three times per day. There wasn't one song that I didn't like, and I'm hard to please. I think this CD is a must for everyone, fan or not."
4,"A good collection, that almost hits the mark.","If you are looking for a good collection of the songs from the show, give this serious consideration. However, if you miss the show and hope that the collection has somehow preserved the magic of the fantastic background music, think again. Most of the songs are great, but some better choices certainly exist. If you have your hopes set too high, as I did, you might be dissappointed."
5,"Very, very, good","This CD features music used in the hit TV show Due South. It has a wide range of music, from ""American Woman"", from the seventies, to ""Ride Forever"", by the star of the show, Paul Gross. This CD is well worth buying, and I recomend it strongly."
5,An interesting blend of all types of music.,This CD is definitely one of my favorites. The variety of music it contains will stay within arms reach instead of being located in a stack of CD's that I grew tired of over a period of time. Even those who are not familiar with the TV show will enjoy it. Give it a listen. It's a kick!
4,Some of the best music from THE BEST show on T.V.,"This is the CD where I first discovered Sarah McLachlan. It's worth buying just for her rendition of ""Posession""."
5,Heartbreakingly Beautiful,"I have several books and another film about the great ballerina Margot Fonteyn, but this film has some wonderfuldance clips I had never seen before, and tells more abouthow she became such a great dancer, and how much she gave of herself as a performer and at what cost. I am so happy to have this in my film library."
2,Returned it,"I purchased it for a friend and she had already seen it so I returned it. Aside from that , she told me that it was kind of gossipy, rather than a study of her ballet story."
2,More gossip than art,"It was so filled with gossip that I didn't watch all 2 hours. It had some interesting info about artistic origins, but after that it was mostly on her fickel social and love life. Get it from netflix first then decide."
5,Margot,"An amazing insight into the life of a fabulous woman and ballerina, she was. What shame she died in the circumstances that she did. I always treasure the chance, I had to see her dance here in Australia.This is a must for every Balletomains' collection."
3,Not what I was expecting,"She is very talented but this album is soooooo depressing do NOT listen if you are sad as you will be looking for a rope, a closet rod, and kitchen chair. She has a great voice, but wish there were some up beat songs on here."
3,Poor format,"In general I think the recipes are good. I have a big complaint about the format. I think it is bad cookbook design to have the ingredient list on the front of the page, and the instructions on the back of that page. You are forever flipping back and forth during cooking, so you can't use a cookbook holder, and will likely get your cookbook wet or stained from ""cooking fingers"". America's Test Kitchen obviously puts an enormous amount of thought into the creation and writing of their recipes. I hope they will put some more thought into book design next time."
4,Great recipes,"When I look at reader reviews of cookbooks, I want to see names of specific recipes that were outstanding, so here's one I tried last night: page 61, Chicken Casserole with Spring Vegetables and Tarragon Cream Sauce (oh, gosh, I just noticed it says it's for 6-8 people, and my husband and I snarfed down half!) Any other recommendations out there??"
4,Good resource for weeknight meals,I like how this book show how you can prep meals when you have time and bake later when you need a quick dinner.
4,Yummy,"My sister made me a dish from this cookbook that I loved so I just had to have the cookbook for myself. But I didn't realize how involved the recipes are :( I like simple recipes that don't require a huge list of ingredients or take hours to prepare. So this just wasn't the cookbook for me. It's just sitting on my shelf now. But the food is amazing!! So if you truly love to cook, it's wonderful for you :)"
5,Good recipes,I have made several recipes from this book and they have been great and easy to follow. this is the first cookbook I own from Cook's Illustrated and I'm now adding one more to my collection.
2,Just not for me,Hardly any photo's. recipes not what i was looking for. I was looking for recipes for a crowd. Returned book.
2,No healthy recipes here,"Many of the recipes use an abundance of heavy cream, half and half, whole milk or butter. I'm sure these dishes taste good, but people I cook for don't need to eat such rich food."
2,Too froo froo,"Great idea for a cook book, but it is set up to be too ""fancy"". It just doesn't flow very well."
1,"I can't hear you, can you hear me???","I can never hear anybody on this phone set, and they can never hear me. I am ready to replace the entire system after 5 months of frustration. I even dug an old phone out the the closet to hold me over. Really, it's worthless if you cannot hear who you are talking to."
1,piece of junk,I bought this to replace a Uniden. This GE is far inferior. The base unit is so light weight it gets knocked over very easily. Ditto for the handset. The rest for the handset is way too small for stability and is constantly knocked off. I can't imagine using this as a wall phone which is supposed to be possible. The sound quality is very poor as is the volume control. Also the verbage on the answering machine is extremely wordy. It takes much longer to review messages than on the Uniden. I'm probably going to replace this piece of crap even though it technically works. I would buy another Uniden except my old unit wasn't very durable.
5,Outstanding!,"What a brilliant concept: a collection of new superheros created by cutting-edge alternative comic artists. The results are spectacular: we're treated to such brilliant weirdness as ""TITANIUS"" by Tony Consiglio, a giant metal-clad man who is shopping for a disguise at the King of Suede men's shop; ""A-OK COOL,"" by Project: Superior assistant co-editor Dean Haspiel; Jeffrey Brown's, ""Aw Sh*t, It's CYCLOCTOPUS!"", and Rugg/Maruca's utterly demented ""Shock-A-Con"". Fantastically original and funny, and beautifully designed and printed by AdHouse Books. A must for comics fans and a can't-lose for any fans of alt/indie lit, music, or art. Five stars, definitely!"
3,They changed the picture the color BUT!,Better watch the song list before buying this one its the Fifth different cover of the same show I encounter. The show is excellent all her songs are there plus pleasant surprises. On My copy the only complaint I could Make was the lack of sound. You`ll have to turn up the volume to the max to get some depth and sound. Her voice is beautiful and the 3 stars is too keep buyers aware of duplicating something you already have.So choose the one with the best price.
2,"Too short, too young","This book is out of date. It is geared toward children. Even so, extremely short and does not have particularly interesting pictures. If you are interested in the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, check out Long and Schouten's wonderful ""Feathered Dinosaurs."""
1,Brain Piercing Kisses,"Oof! Does that girl know how to belt out notes or what? Her music made my glasses break and I had all the neighborhood dogs scratching at my door.She has good potential and a beautiful voice but geez, Take it down an octave and about 30 decibels."
4,Jessica Simpson- Terrific Texan,"Jessica's album is pretty cool, but a little overrated. Good luck Jessica!"
3,Most of the songs got kinda boring,"Only a few of the songs were actually good. I just got the CD a few days ago, and I went through it listening to every song and only a couple of the songs are the kind of songs you would want to hear again. Most of them were just boring and unorginal. But my favorite songs were ""I wanna love you forever"" and ""I've got my eyes on you"""
4,Sweet Kisses,Sweet Kisses by Jessica Simpson is an awesome cd and I Wanna Love You Forever is the best song. Everybody should get this cd. It's just too good.
5,What I thought,"I don't remember if Sweet Kisses was her first album I bought or if it was A Public Affair, but I thought Sweet Kisses was okay. There was only a few songs that I liked on it but it's still good.One thing that I never realized was when I was younger, I watched that Rugrats In Paris movie so much, I couldn't figure out what that one song was, when they were in the sushi bar. I heard it again years later when I bought the album. I didn't realize they had Final Heartbreak in it. A LITTLE too loud (at times) for comfort but it's a good song."
3,SWEET HARMONIES IN THIS...,"Something is undeniable Jessica Simpson has a gifted voice. Her debut album was a mix of Britney-pop tunes and Celine-attemp ballads. In the pop uptempo tune way she achieve easy goin' tracks that fitted just well to that time in music, her highlight ballad ""I Wanna Love You Forever"", is the only nice ballad here, the other ones failed in a slot of being pure fillers and really boring tracks that lack of meaning. After all this is Jessica's most famous album ever and if you need pure pop...you will like this at the beginning but at the end you'll be sleeping the last 4 tracks are simply lame."
2,Unimaginative,"A complete bore! All the songs were precisely the same overdone sap. Gaudy, melodramatic, and corny to a pinpoint. I bet the ""good girl"" image was to back up her not-that-great voice. Her singing isn't bad, but it's definitely not worth all the fame and attention that's been towards this album. When or if she makes another album, she needs more diverse original songs. Then she'd be half as creative and talented as the industry makes her appear to be."
2,2 stars for 2 good songs,"I bought this CD because both of Jessica Simpsons songs on the radio were very good. I was so dissapointed though. The rest of the songs on here were awful. I think you should buy the single, you will get more satisfaction than buying the whole CD.The only good songs on here were where you are and I wanna love you forever. The rest were really not worth your money. Dont get me wrong, she has an excellent voice but the rest of the songs on here did not have the same beat as the 2 songs on the radio."
3,not as good as i axpected!,"when i first heard the song i wanna love you forever i thought that we got the next mariah carey, but after i bought the album and listend to it, i was really disappointed. she needs to work harder on her voice, if she really wants to survive in this business."
2,Sounds too Star Search to me....,"Jessica has a good voice but nothing too dynamic. I think it's mainly due to the material being sappy and unoriginal. I live in Dallas and I kept hearing on the radio stations that she would be the next Mariah Carey and maybe she has some qualities like Mariah but her producers need to pick better songs. In my opinion, out of the teen pop stars out right now, Christina Aguillera has the best voice, more mature sound, than compared to Britney, Brandi, and Jessica."
3,good,"She has an amazing vocal range. I really like some of the songs, but i think her producers took the cd in the wrong direction.Some of the songs just didn't work for me. I expect wonderful things from her in the future, but she needs some new people to work with."
3,Not Too Bad,"I like the way she sings the first track and I think the way she sings that song is kind of different from all of the artists I know of. I have to say she gives her best effort in terms of overall performance, but she still needs some time to pick the kind of songs that both celine Dion and Maria Carey have chosen. If she can do that, she might be able to truly express her talents and to become a five-star artist."
5,sweet kisses,"i am very impressed with this CD, i just got done listening to it on here...and i am thinking about buying it. i think that she has real talent and isn't just going with the new fad of teenage girl singers. a lot of these new girls' voices are all computers, but i don't believe jessica simpson's is at all. jessica if u are reading, congradulations on a great CD!"
3,A beautiful Voice for sure,"I think that Jessica Simpson has a GREAT voice when I heard ""I wanna Love You Forever"" it took my breath away she has one of the most beautiful voices I've heard in a long time another Great song on there is ""Your Faith In Me"" yet, another song that shows how truely great her voice really is ""I think I'm In Love With You"" is another great track along with her duet with Nick. ""Final Heartbreak"" is great and so is ""I've got My Eyes on you"" as for the rest they are not so good. Some of them seem to go on and on and on with no real melody to them. She does have some really awesome songs though so the cd is worth getting. Some of the songs on this cd are just here to take up space but like I said she has some really beautiful songs on here and a great voice as well. I just hope she can choose the right songs to flourish her wonderful sound."
3,"Good voice, needs to learn. . .","How to use it effectively. The ballads show how good a voice she has, but the problem is, she doesn't use it very well. On the ballads, she overemotes and ends up shrieking (""I Wanna Love You Forever,"" ""Where You Are""), and and the uptempos, she seems to run out over energy and sounds out of breath and tired (""I've Got My Eyes On You,"" ""Woman In Me""). Actually, there are some ""Britney-esque"" songs on this album, contrary to the previous reviews. And Aguilera has just as good a voice, don't be fooled by the poor reviews below. If you like the Britney Spears uptempos, the vocal range of Christina Aguilera, and the ballads of early Mariah Carey, you'll enjoy this album."
2,Potential but Overdone,"It's strange that I bought this CD based on a song I didn't like. ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" is an over-the-top love song that starts off with a catty whisper and then turns into a scream fest with Jessica obviously trying to show off her vocal range. But I do think she has a good voice. Therefore, I bought the CD thinking...rather, hoping this first single was just overdone for the sake of showing of that voice and in the rest of the CD she'd show more control. Boy, was I wrong. I've already given the CD to my friend for her B-day. I still stand by the fact that she has a great voice, but every song is over the top and it sounds like she's screaming her declarations of love instead of singing them. And, even when she is toned down, it all ends up sounding the same. EVERY song is just like the one before it. Jessica has talent, but she needs to collaborate with other people who know how to properly showcase that talent and not make her sound like a Carey/Dion/Houston wannabe."
3,A good singer but...,"OK, miss Simpson is a good singer: she's talented, and owns a nice voice but she doesn't hold a candle to Mariah Carey and her unique voice and writing-ability.Still, Jessica Simpson is way better than snotty brats such as Britney Spears.Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Be prepared to be surprised,"To begin with, Jessica is the first of the teen pop queens to get out of her teens. She has an appealing yet relatively wholsome album. Highlights include all the singles(but IWLYF and Where You Are have been overplayed), Woman in Me, My Wonderful, Your Faith in Me, and Heart of Innocence. The last is about a subject true to her, her choice to stay a virgin until marriage. She is a vocal powerhouse, hitting notes some could never dream about(like britney) but sometimes the notes sound more like screaming. Her lower register is just as nice and she should use it more. Overall, the album is fun, appealing, and should be the beginning of a long career."
5,She Is The Best!,"I don't care what anyone says, Jessica Simpson is the best of all the pop divas! Her songs are all wonderful!1.I Wanna Love You Forever: Her first hit! It show how good her voice is.2.I Think I'm In Love With You: A very cute song, that you just can't help to clap with.3.Where You Are: A sad, but beautiful song with 98 degrees.4.Final Heartbreak: A fast song, that is great to dance to.5.Woman In Me: This song she sang with Destiny's Child.6.I've Got My Eyes On You: This has a great beat to it!7.Betcha She Don't Love You: This one is kinda has the same beat like 'I've Got My Eyes On You' expect a little slower.8.My Wonderful: A great song. When I saw her in concert with Ricky Martin she sang it to little boy who was picked out of the audience.9.Sweet Kisses: A great song!10.Your Faith In Me: A very up lifting song.11.Heart of Innocence: So sweet."
4,The Voice Surpasses Teen Pop,"The bottom line is this: Simpson has the pipes. There's no doubt about this. She possesses all of the range and emotion of Houston, Carey, and Aguilera, but is refreshingly without affectation or showmanship. The material is juvenile and the orchestration average. However, Simpson's managed to move beyond it, make it her own, and belt it out better than her contemporaries.For those who think she's a one-hit wonder, don't bet on it. This voice is here to stay."
2,she needs to not sing bad songs,"I have to admit; she is better than any other of these young, generic singers. That's the problem though; she's singing generic songs. Have you heard her? She can totally be like Mariah Carey. She can't go anywhere singing these cheesy songs. She needs to get a more mature sounding voice, write her own songs and then she may have potential."
3,Has some great pop songs,"Jessica Simpson may not have achieved the huge amount of fame Britney Spears did upon the release of her first CD, but that doesn't mean she didn't possess talent. Sweet Kisses, her Columbia Records debut album, proves the former Christian circuit performer a worthy advisary. ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" is a stunning, haunting ballad that really shows off Simpson's once-clear singing voice, ""I Think I'm In Love With You"" is an uptempo song about, well, being in love, and ""Where You Are"" is an often overlooked song that is one of the best of the record. Sadly, like most teen pop albums of the late 90s and early 2000s, the remaining part of the CD is mostly inconsistent filler, save for the touching ""Your Faith In Me."" Still, this is by far Jessica Simpson's most honest album in the days when she was known for her voice, and not for her stupidity."
4,Jessica Simpson sparkles on her debut album,"Pop singer Jessica Simpson sparkles on her debut album Sweet Kisses. Her most powerful song is her breakout hit, the temptuous love-ballad ""I Wanna Love you Forever,"" which pushes Simpson into the limelight as a possible teen Celine Dion. The album has its amount of filler too, which is sad. Through it all, though, SK deserves the star treatment for its emotional expressiveness and passionate, tear-jerker love songs (""I Wanna Love You Forever,"" ""Where You Are"" and ""Faith in Me""), and proves that Jessica isn't just another teen pop singer. That said, I think her voice isn't nearly as powerful as Christina Aguilera's or as atypical as Britney's...yet Jessica Simpson definitely sounds better than Mandy Moore on her debut release! Buy this album. It's worth the sappy love songs."
3,"strong voice, but cd lacks substance.","Jessica Simpson has a very powerful voice, but her cd fails to bring it out to it's full potentional. There are 2 or 3 catchy songs, but they get old fast. This is another example of ruining your cd by putting in too many sappy ballads.I recommend buying this album used, and possibly on tape, and waiting patiently for her new cd to come out. :)"
3,Okay,"I really like her voice, but I think it gets a little too sharp and nasal in some of the songs. Her songs are really pretty, but if she kinda worked on her voice it'd be perfect!"
1,Sweet kisses...yeah right,"On the album cover, it looks like Jessica's in a pissy mood over Nick or something. She doesn't look like she's about to give sweet kisses. She wants to punch somebody. What I do like about the album cover is she appears to be naked. What I don't like is there's no shot of her entire naked body. This CD is good for a coaster and the cover art is good for giving guys wood, but the CD's not good for placing in a CD player and pressing play."
1,She can sing...,"...Like that really matters. What good is a voice when you don't have anything to back it up? Is't that the purpose of listening to music? To actually listen to MUSIC? What is the big obsession with vocalists nowadays? Every big selling album released within the past few years sounds exactly like this. It's still nothing but stupid dance beats, fluffy sound effects, and Simpson's noxiously sickening vocals. I don't care if she can sing, it doesn't make this garbage listenable at all."
2,mediocre teen pop,"here we go again, another teen pop singer ala mariah, it works for mariah, miss simpsons vocals are a whinier version of mariah careys. the album is fairly generic enough, the hit being ""i wanna love you forever"" but after hearing her scream out the words, im not sure if i wanted to hear the rest, i did, and that said shes no france joli,( a canadian teenage singer) the rest of the album has mostly filler songs. i susspect she will eventually find her groove, just as long as she stops emulating mariah cary..."
2,Don't try so hard.......,"It's obvious that Jessica has a strong voice but I think she is ""screaming"" out her songs. She's trying too hard to prove a point....meaning she wants the world to know that she can hold a note. If she tones down her next album I think she can strike gold. There's a time and a place for a song. If it's a love song then make it pleasant to the ears. Don't let the public get you down either.......it's a tough world out there....keep on moving!"
2,HORRIBLE SONGS,Jessica Simpson has an extremly beautiful voice and she is a very lucky lady to have that.So she shouldnt take advantage of that beautiful voice by singing bad songs.She follows great teen solo women singing sensations such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera who's carreers are just starting to sky rocket up to the top and Mandy Moore is working her way up there so it is a tough competion for Jessica and I think she should stop while she is ahead
5,This CD is AWESOME,"Jessica Simpson is an AWESOME singer, and you really need to get this CD if you don't already have it! My favorite song off of the album is either ""Where You Are"", or ""Your Faith In Me"", and she can hit those high notes (I think my window cracked when she hit that one in ""Your Faith In Me"", hehehe)! If you don't have this CD, you're really missing out!"
4,Sweet nothings: Jessica sings [and screams] about love,"Jessica Simpon's debut SWEET KISSES has ""diva in training"" written all over it. SWEET KISSES is a great pop album and it shows Jessica as having a romantic spirit. It begins with the hit ""I wanna love you forever"", which Jessica sings with pure passion. She's so passionate about each song, sometimes she forgets about the limmitations of her voice, and let's out a scream. It's ok, you can look past those occasional shreiks 'cause SWEET KISSES is a pretty consistant album. It's filled with great uptempos like ""I think i'm in love with you"" and ""I've got my eyes on you"" and the ballads are awesome. Jessica plays it cool on the dreamy ballad ""my wonderful"" which is one of her best moves. She's also at her best on songs like ""your faith in me"" and ""heart of innocence."" SWEET KISSES shows Jessica as a girl wrapped in the bliss of being in love."
3,it's ok,"Jessica has such a beautiful voice! As much as I love her as a person, this isn't a very good cd. The only songs that I like are ""I wanna love you forever"", ""I think Im in love with you"", ""where you are"", ""Heart of innocence"", and ""your faith in me"". Those are only 5 songs on an entire cd. 3 of those songs are singles so I would recommend that you buy the singles instead of the cd."
3,"Potential--but she's gotten too famous for her life, not her music","Okay, so Jessica Simpson used to be able to sing. Sadly, her late 1999 debut Sweet Kisses is hardly a brilliant piece of work; it lacks in consistency more than anything. Her disc's singles ""I Wanna Love You Forever,"" ""I Think I'm In Love With You"" and ""Where You Are"" are stunning pieces of pop music, as is the faith-filled belter ""Your Faith in Me."" But everything else is, sadly, filler and poor filler at that. 3 stars because of the inconsistencies as well as for the annoying Simpson fodder surround her life; she achieved fame for being something she no longer is: married. She is no longer famous for her music."
2,"Not Britney or Mandy, yet she doesn't have her own sound","A decent try for star power, Jessica lacks the great dance songs. I'd like to see one song that's breakthrough, like an Arabian sound ""In My Pocket"" has. Her songs are just a little too bubblegum pop with no substance, nothing stands out. But she isn't completely bad. Her love ballads could melt the coldest hearts.Best songs: ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" and ""Where You Are"". They are so sweet they give me cavities.Worst songs: About all the rest, but the one that stands out is ""I Think I'm In Love With You""She isn't THAT bad but her first 2 records could use some fine tuning."
4,A fresh face to the scene of Pop,"Jessica Simpson is the girl next door, who appears very sweet, innocent and with that girly nature about her. Unlike the harsh bossy attitude Christina Aguiliera brings to her recordings, Jessica combines the cutsy image of Britney Spears, but with a real voice that shines forth on emotional ballads as ""I wanna love you forever, and where you are.""Be forewarned, Jessica is not in the category of Britney, so the comparisons are none. Her album may not appeal to the young 8 year old, but for those who appreciate strong vocals that rival that of Celine Dion and Whitney, she definately deserves a listen to.In final, Jessica will be a strong up and comming artist for 2001, particularily with her new album, ""Hot like Fire"" However, Jessica Please take note, don't dissapoint your fans with less than average R&B as the SpiceGirls did on ""Forever"""
1,Very Predictable,whoever her handlers are see a Young Mariah take mixed with Celine Dion.all in all it's a mess.she is trying to hard to sound Like something that takes Years.now personally Celine DIon&Mariah are Both SOulLess to Me but they can sing.the Material they choose is Lightweight.so when a 3rd tier singer like Jessica Simpson comes along you know it's super sappy.and it is.very cliched words&music.
1,Beauty IS only skin deep!,"I first saw and heard her ""screaming"" the song -""I wanna love you forever"" on VH1. Not good. Then I recently saw her with ""Nick"" on MTV's SnowBound. She should be embarassed. Jessica will disappear off the radar screen faster then you can scream ""GOODBYE!"""
1,"Jessica Simpson ""Sweet Kisses""","i hate to break all your hearts out there but Jessica Simpson is nothing special. All she really does is scream. Her voice is better than average, but seriously folks, she's only a clone the record co. was desperate to make cause they need them out there. If you want to hear a whiney, Mariah Carey wannabe, listen to Jessica Simpson. If you want to hear a real, original, fresh singer, listen to Christina Aguilera."
1,Skanky Mariah Wannabe,"Jessica Simpson is a horrible singer, possibly worse than the reigning Queen of Awful Music, Britney Spears. She will NEVER be Mariah Carey!"
1,just as bad as mandy moore,"If anyone thinks this girl can sing you wrong. Well okay maybe she is a bit better than mandy moore. But still she cant sing. Jessica simpson is just another blond hired for her looks, then she sings in a horrible voice then the people in the studio alter it, tell her what to sing, and what to say in her intervies except for maybe as she would say ""im a christian"" why does everybody take that as she is some kind of angel. From what ive seen she's not an angel and in my opinion could likely be a hooker. All her songs basically are the same, that is what all pop groups sing about and that is being i love with boys or girls depending on whos seeing. Jessica doesnt play an instrument, she doesnt write her on songs. What is she even does here in the music bizz. and also i would have to say she not a cristian."
3,Nothing Special but nothing unspecial,"I think that all and all, Jessica Simpson is a good singer. She isn't like the annoying britney spears wannabes yet she somewhat like Celene dion. they both have the voices that could drive you crazy and make you wanna shot yourself after 2 songs, plus they look alike, but shes not too bad. i think her songs are totally perfect for dances and proms etc.. so i say you'd probably only want this cd if you like lovey dovery music"
2,"Nice Vocal Range, but lacks emotion","Jessica Simpson does have a great voice- that's easy to notice once you've heard ""I Wanna Love You Forever"", but she lacks the emotion that some other teenager-singers (like Christina Aguilera) has. She can sing well, but it's like she's not really thinking about the words. Maybe she'll be better in the future when she does learn some more about putting emotion in songs."
5,Wonderful!,"Jessica Simpson is a wonderful new artist with a wonderful album. I was a bit surprised to see this in the stores today, and when I did I debated, then purchased it. Glad I did. I had the single which was good, but the album blows it out of the water, which in some cases isn't always right. If you're a fan of Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera, you'll love Jess. Push her up that ladder. She's quite attractive as well. :-) Great young star."
3,Good try Jessica!,"This Cd was ok, I only liked a few tracks. The ones I liked:I Wanna Love You ForeverI Think I'm In Love With YouWhere You AreSweet KissesI didn't like the other songs. Sorry Jess, better luck next album."
2,SO-SO,her music is ok. i dont own the cd but have listened to her songs on the radio and the samples on amazon. after i write this im heading straight for the tylenol cuz all jessica's shreaking and whining gives me a headache. her songs are meaningless and she sings them with no emotion or feeling. jessica has some good tunes but she really needs to put some heart into her lyrics. the girls got real potential and a GREAT voice she just doesn't know how to use her talents. i hope she'll learn eventually because this album makes me cringe.
2,Has potential?,"I will give Jessica Simpson her props. She does have some vocal talent, but it sure wouldn't help to take some vocal lessons to learn how to use the voice properly. If Jessica got some voice lessons, she might be a powerhouse to reckon with. Until then, I will have to say that ""Sweet Kisses"", which is Jessica's debut effort, was an above average effort considering she is just another teenybopper. Not quite as listenable as Christina Aguilera's debut, but better than the rest. Jessica's ballads are definitely her high points and the uptempo numbers are by far her weak points(""I've got my eyes on you"" sounds like the annoying and nasal sounds of Britney Spears). Hopefully, by the time Jessica begins her sophomore effort she will have gotten those voice lessons. Who knows, she might finally be able to distance herself from the rest of the pack of teenyboppers."
2,can get very annoying,"look, this girl is an amazing singer, we all know it, but she lacks the material in this cd. Her single ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" is overdramatized. I don't know if I am the only one but doesnt this single sound like a modern version of ""Take My Breath Away"" from Top Gun? Maybe this would be a very good song on a soundtrack or during the climax of a film. Her songs pretty much sound the same. If your just a normal music fan, i am warning you not to buy this cd. If you are a very emotional kind of person who loves those pop ballads from the 80's then it might not be a bad buy. This cd is only a building block for Jessica Simpson. Once she starts working with top notch writers, stand by because this girl will make britney, christina, and mandy a mere memory."
1,SOUR KISSES,"I saw Jessica open for Ricky Martin and I was definately impressed with her voice. However, I'm NOT impressed with this album. It sounds like she's screaming on every song!Who is she trying to impress? If she toned it down this might have been better. Maybe when she matures, gets better material and softens her image I'll become a listener once again. In the meantime, I'm passing this C.D. off to Goodwill."
4,A Great CD By A Great Teen Sensation!,"I am very glad that I bought Jessica Simpson's latest CD titled ""Sweet Kisses."" I enjoy practically every song on it. Her and Mandy Moore are the new female teen sensations, other than Christina and Britney, of course! My three favorite songs on the CD are Final Heartbreak, I've Got My Eyes On You, and I Think I'm In Love With You. The one song that I do not like at all is ""I Wanna Love You Forever."" That song is too whiny and loud for me. Overall, Jessica Simpson's latest CD is a good choice to buy."
2,Of all the young blonded her musix is the weakest,there is nothing good about this album except for the raw talent of jessica's voice.The songwriting is horrible and theblandness of the music is undescribeable
4,A Diva-In-Training,"This CD is really great! You can call her a Mariah-in-Training, but don't ever compare her to Britney.My favorite songs in this album are I Wanna Love You Forever and Where You Are which are beautifully written by Sam Watters of Color Me Badd and her idol Mariah Carey, although she disguised herself as Louis Biancaniello, Jessica admitted that that was Mariah herself.There's some moving songs here like Your Faith in Me and her self-penned Heart of Innocence. Her vocal range evidenced in the song I Wanna Love You Forever put her in league with Britney and Christina...THIS CD COMBINES MARIAH'S SUPERSIZE PIPES AND CHRISTINA'S BOUNCY BUBBLE GUM POP."
3,not as good as I expected,"I had to rate this CD 3stars for the 2 wonderful songs on the album ""Where You Are"" and ""I Wanna Love You Forever."" The other songs like ""Final Heartbreak"" and ""My Wonderful"" were nice. I liked ""Heart of Innocence"" because of the lyrics...about saving yourself til marriage, but her voice was a little weak on that one. I couldn't listen to ""I've Got my Eyes on You"", it was so bad (sorry! ) it just wasn't her best work. Sorry, Jess, but if you get some better songs, I'm sure you're next album will be great."
4,Over all Great CD!,"Jessica Simpson will definitely make it big!Unlike Britney Spears Jessica has a very strong voice!My Wonderful, I Think I'm In Love With you and Woman In Me are my favorites! I also like Final Heartbreak and Heart of Innocence. She is a great singer and she definitly has better looks than Britney Spears by far!"
3,Good CD but. . . .,"I don't know. There's something wrong with this CD. (I'm not trying to diss Jessica Simpson, by the way). I think it's 'cause all of her songs are about love. I mean, really. Sure, some songs should be about love-but not the whole CD! It makes the CD seem kinda mushey or something. I thought tracks 1 & 3 were the best. The rest, however, I could care less for. If you only liked the tracks 1 & 3, then you're probably better off buying the singles for them instead. Or buy the ""Here on Earth"" soundtrack, 'cause that probably has track #3 on it. This is an okay first album, but she'll probably need to work on quality and her voice for future albums. So, unless you absolutely LOVE Jessica's music, then I really wouldn't recommend this CD to you. P.S.: Okay, I'll admit it. She does have a good voice and sort of sounds like Mariah Carey but she is definintely not up to Mariah's level in the music world yet!"
2,Another Teen on the Bandwagon,"Jessica Simpson has a good voice, but her cd is cliched and over produced. Her voice sounds much like Mariah Carey's, but her cd is just not full of great material. It would have been wiser if she would have waited a few years and released a cd with better songs. A good cd if you like Mariah Carey or the other teenagers who have made it big. If you are looking for something new...this is not it."
5,Jessica has a lot of talent,"I LOVE THIS CD! Jessica Simpson ""Sweet Kisses"" is an awesome CD! She has a beautiful voice, and her upbeat songs are very dancy, and her slow songs are very slow and pretty, so you can have both *Lol* Take one CD for whatever mood you're in! My fave is probably ""Heart Of Innocence"" which Jessica CO-wrote and dedicated to her future husband. I LOVE it! It just makes me think how can people sleep around so much? I mean, shouldn't it be special? And I'm getting of the subject here, so back on to the CD. *LoL* This is one of the few CDs I've listened to all the way through when I got it. I have the problem of I'll listen to the first 4 or 5 songs, then I'll never listen to the rest of the CD! But this one I can't do that to, the whole thing is just to good!Love & God Bless, Laurel"
4,Jessica Simpson is NOT a clone of Britney and Christina (at least she wasn't with this album),"While the quality of her subsequent albums has been on a steady decline, Jessica Simpson's first album is a gorgeous vocal showcase that should have kept Britney locked in the closet for a long time. A very able singer who can really shout when she wants to, it was rather unfortunate that this album was released in the same year that brought Britney into the spotlight, because Jessica deserved the fame a lot more. Unfortunately, after the weak sales of this album, she lowered her musical standards for the purpose of selling out for bigger profit, a mistake that she has yet to recover from."
1,nothing new.,"The music from the song I think I am in love with you is the same music from John Mellencamp's Jack and Diane. The 1st time I heard this I thought, but yet another remake. I was surprised that she had the same music, but different words. My girls think that she is differently original. THey think I am wrong. NOT"
1,Someone Sold Jessica Out!,"Although Jessica's voice is melodic, tranquil, even mind blowing, the lyrics of the songs she is singing in ""Sweet Kisses"" have betrayed her hypnotic, crystal clear sound. As a lyricist myself, I think I myself could have given her a more flexible and searing lyrics than presented here. I want to see better lyrics for you, Jessica. I'd listen to you before Brittany any day of the week! Adios Amiga!"
1,Is someone killing a cat?,Someone please put Jessica Simpson out of her misery. She could do so much better if she only sang songs that her voice could handle. Mariah Carey she will never be and she needs to realize this and invest her new found fame & fortune in some voice lessons! Better luck next time!
2,Fans can never be objective...,We've heard these songs a million times b 4...nice...but forgettable.
3,True and Genuine,"Out of all these stupid pop ""artists"" today the only one I can actually stand is Jessica Simpson. She's no goddess but there is something about her that I like. True, she doesn't write her own songs,but it still seems like she has more talent. Her voice is the strongest and the nicest. And her singles ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" and ""Where We Are,"" are beutiful songs. ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" is probably one of my favorite songs. I myself sing, and I find it extremely difficult to sing that song, but songs by Britanny Spears and Mandy Moore, I don't even have to try to sound like them. Jessica Simpson also displays an entirely different image. She dresses normal and she doesn't act like a stupid phony. Though people do notice her, she's not overated. Not many people talk about her though. So if anything she's underated. Jessica Simpson may not be the best but her voice is genuine and real and so is she."
3,Too much filler but still pretty good,"Jessica Simpson was the third in the 1999 boom of female pop star phenomenoms. Her debut Sweet Kisses boasts a lot of sappy filler (and when I say a lot I mean A LOT), but it's its singles that make it a worthwhile purchase. Breakout hit ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" is a beautifully sung and written tune, and shows off the artist's powerful chops. Sure, she's no Christina vocally and her songs aren't nearly as addictive as teen queen Britney Spears's 1998 smash ""...Baby One More Time."" But Jessica Simpson was somewhat of a kindred spirit nonetheless with her sugary-sweet ballads. By far Sweet Kisses is Simpson's best vocal record; there's no Britney soundalike songs here, folks! Overall, Sweet Kisses is pretty sweet...but if you could just purchase tracks 1, 2, 3 and 10, it'd be a much better piece of fluff."
3,Too much filler.,"There is 3-5 songs that are listenable, and the rest is just horrible...HORRIBLE fillers. Songs such as ""Final Heartbreak"", ""Your Faith In Me"", and such are just horrible. Its awful. On the other hand, songs such as ""Where You Are"", and ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" are just beautiful. She is more of a ballad singer than a ""pop"" singer. So therefore, her ballads are much better. Relaxing really."
1,Too much screaming!,I agree that Jessica Simpson focuses TOO much on her voice instead of her music. I recommend you get Mandy Moore's So Real instead of this.
3,Jessica has a nice voice but....,The songs on this album are not really that great. She does have a great voice but what good does that do if the songs stink! Maybe she'll work with different people on her next album because this is not it.
1,"Wow, Jessica sings too?","I did not know that. But honey, please don't.I thought Jessica was just known for looking good with little or no clothing and mistaking fish for chicken. I wonder why she's not as well known for her music.Sure Jessica, you're a hottie, but leave music to the musicians."
1,I'm SO SO Sorry!,"I tried to love this album...but I just bloody can't! Her being from Dallas...me being from Dallas, you know I have to support her..but honestly, this album gives me a headache. I didn't like ""I Wanna Love You Forever"" because well, it's really really LOUD, she practically screams the whole song! But I overlooked that, I mean Melanie C screamed on her debut single (Goin'Down) and I bought her album hoping it would get better (turns out Goin'Down was the best song on the album), and bought the album. Mistake. The whole album is like one big giant song, every song is like the other, it blends in so well, I swear if I didn't know that there were different songs on it, I would think the whole CD was a long song. While her back-ups are impressive enough, getting 98 Degreezer Nick Lachey and other Texas Natives Destiny's Child, but even then, the album doesn't get any better. I'm sorry Jessica...but I can't wait for Mandy Moore's album...this should be good :-)"
2,"Well, her A&R failed her...","I bought this album because of the first single and the video. I was impressed with Jessica's vocals. But, after listening to the entire album, I am disappointed with the selection of songs and the production arrangements. I feel that her A&R rep should have picked better songs for Jessica, songs with more power to match her powerful vocals. For instance, in the song with Destiny's Child, I expected some groove or soul, instead the whole song was a teaser, it never really took off...which goes for the whole album, except the first single. Maybe A&R will do some much needed remixing for radio and videos? They should..."
2,get some help from Ricky Martin,"I saw her singing at the Ricky Martin concert in Atlanta, Georgia and she was ok. I bought her cd, because I thought it was going to be better than ok, BIG MISTAKE. She has the voice, but she wants to immitate Celine too much and all the screaming ! GIVE ME A BREAK ! Maybe she will hook up with all of Ricky's producers and get better advice for her next cd."
2,"Hmm... Not too good, not too bad....","Er... One thing I really don't like about her is that she's always wailing, day and night. She tries to make herself sound like Mariah Carey, but, honestly, she just can't do it. She needs improvement."
3,SWEET KISSES,She sounds like Christina but Christina is still alot better than her. SHe is still good and the cd is still good. You can give it a chance you will either hate it or like it. It is ok for me. I don't listen to it all the time though. Maybe once in awhile
2,Shows promise....,"But the CD just isn't good. Jessica has a nice voice, but the quality of songs on theis album is just sad. There are a few good songs but not that many.I haven't gotten Jessica's new CD yet, but I hope they do her some justice and have her sing some songs that are good, she deserves better than what was on most of this album.There are only 4 songs on that are good on the CD: 1. I Wanna Love You Forever 2. I Think I'm in Love With You 6. I've Got My Eyes on You 10. Your Faith in MeBut it seems on those tracks she is trying way to hard to be either Mariah Carey or Britney Spears."
3,For A Debut Album - I Think It Falls Short,"Jessica has got one powerful voice, I will admit to that, but for her debut, I think she falls short of a less than perfect album. For one thing there are way too many ballads (6), and not enough ear-pricking tunes. But if I had to choose my favorite songs I would pick: ""I Wanna Love You Forever,"" her voice is extraordinary here, ""I Think I'm In Love With You,"" which contains replay elements of Jack & Diane, and this song will no doubt find you on the dance floor, and ""Heart Of Innocence"" which Jessica co-wrote herself, and I commend her for that, because unlike most bubblegum singers, her's works at the best of her ability. If your a Jessica Simpson fan you'll definitely get it, however, if your the type of person who loves ballads then this might be the album for you!"
2,Jessica needs more brains!!,"The two stars Jessica gets is for the two songs I like! "" I Wanna Love You Forever"" & ""Where You Are"" are the sweet songs that I love in this CD. ""Final Heartbreak"" & ""Sweet Kisses"" are OK, but I dispise ""Woman in Me"", because it gets on my nerves 24/7/365! You may rate this CD 5 stars, but that won't change my vote!"
5,Great Album!,"Jessica Simpson has a little something for everyone. From the upbeat songs like Woman in Me, I Think I'm in Love, and Final Heartbreak, to the soulful ballads like I Wanna Love You Forever, Where You Are, and Your Faith in Me, the fun never stops. She is not the average teen girl pop artist. She has more mature music, but still fun to listen to. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to hear something new and wonderful!"
2,Rather Disappointed!,"I brought this CD the other day, and to tell you the truth, I was expecting it to be a lot better. First of all, I think Jessica Simpson has a beautiful voice. I enjoyed her ballads(I Wanna Love You Forever,Your Faith in Me,Where You Are)but the rest of the songs need some help (I Think I'm in Love With You, I've Got My Eyes On You, Final Heartbreak). Overall, Jessica Simpson's ""Sweet Kisses"" was not a horrible CD but with better writing material this CD could have been a remarkable one."
4,Pretty good,"Sweet Kisses by Jessica Simpson is a pretty good cd. It, like most cds out there, needs improvement. Jessica's songs seem to be a special blend of soul, pop, and R&B. She always seems like a very spiritual person in interviews and that shines through with her music. Her songs aren't whiny pop or very ""danceable"", but they're much more musical than some of her competition's songs. I would definitely recommend this cd to people."
2,Nothing worth getting excited about,"This album really isn't one of the best I've ever heard. I mean some of the love songs are nice, 'I wanna love you forever',' Where you are' and perhaps the bonus track. But the only upbeat songs I really like are 'Final Heartbreak', and 'I've got me eyes on you'- even that gets boring it's so repetitive. Their isn't anything amazingly original here and there are too many so-so love songs which don't have very good tunes. I was expecting 'Sweet Kisses' to be great but it has a boring chorus and it's not really one of the standout tracks. It's OK if you like love songs, if you don't you'll just end up throwing your cd player out of the window. If you do like it go and buy Christina Aguilera/Jennifer Love Hewitt's albums, they're like better versions of this."
1,crap,"i have a respect for the mockery music has become, she should be given and M-16 A2 and put into combat"
1,Yawn,"This CD is a disappointment. Jessica has a nice voice but in almost every song she sings she goes overboard, screaming rather than singing. Also, the material on this album is not terribly original and sounds like every artist out there - boring and unimaginative. In short, Sweet Kisses is sappy, shallow and derivative. It wouldn't hurt to try something new for her next album."
5,The Next Mariah Carey,"Jessica Simpson has to be the best of the teenage diva crop (Britney, Christina, Mandy, etc) yet. She makes the rest of the crop look like amateurs. She has the most amazing voice. I bought this album strictly on the merits of ""I Wanna Love You Forever"". When I first heard the song, I thought I was listening to Mariah Carey. Although, not all the songs on the CD are as fabulous as this first single, very few artists can say every song on their album is a hit. I think this CD has the potential for 4 or 5 more singles, namely ""Where You Are, Final Heartbreak, Betcha She Don't Love You, Heart of Innocence"" or somewhere along those lines. I am so glad to buy a CD from someone that can actually carry a tune and do it with style and grace."
4,eye stick,Good product. Very hard to find locally - so I like the on line order process. The handling and mailing charges are a bit hefty for such a small item. Thus less than five stars - but a good product with prompt delivery.
5,Biased but impressed.,"I got this monitor at a great price from Newegg.com before it was discovered by everyone so I may be biased. To be honest, the market price went up is up $200 within 1 week of my purchase so it is possible mine was just a mistaken price they decided to honor. Regardless, this is an exception monitor with an excellent color, bright and vivid images,and crisp text that blew me away. I replaced a Iiyama 17""CRT that was 5 years old and top ranked when I bought it with this monitor and could not believe how much better it looked and performed. Best yet, it looks really cool on my now clean desktop and can be adjusted in height, angle and pivot so easily I am constantly changing its posture based on what I am doing (internet, word processing, gaming. You'll love it!"
1,"so so software, horrible service","I received this product as a gift for Christmas. The manuals were not very helpful. It attempts to tell you ways to have both Windows and Linux on the same computer, but unless you are very lucky it doesn't work. I now cannot use my windows 98 OS and I can't get rid of Linux. I have contacted their ""support"" through email over a week ago and still have heard no reply. THIS IS NOT FOR AMATEURS! The only people I suggest this for are Linux specialists or people who enjoy pain."
1,hated it,i'm sorry to be blunt but i bought this product just by reading the review and the price was right but i regret it. i just threw it away because it smells really strong and weired. i regret buying this product and for anyone wanting to buy this based on the reviews i'd recommend you smell it first because its not a good scent. good luck
2,Disappointed Buyer,"I bought this book for my son, based upon a review I had read. I was very disappointed when the book arrived. Basically it's an over glorified ad for other books. Inside the book it tells little antidotes and advertises other pieces of literature before the end of the story. While it does tell a bit about the life of Jesus, its not worth the money. Take my word for it, your money can be better spent on other motivational literature."
1,not a recommended product,"Total lack of documentation, quirky installation, poor tech support and unreliable access scan process makes this one of my worst purchases."
5,There's nothing 'personal' here!,"I wonder if the reader from Austin, Texas, read the same book as I did! I could find no trace of any personal attacks (nor personal glorifications, for that matter) in this highly original, provocative and exceptionally well-argued book. Interdisciplinary collaborations on complex themes are notoriously difficult to pull off, but this team has succeeded admirably. The philosophical analysis of the significance of the bonobo ape research for our currently dominant ways of thinking about language, communication and animal capacities is strikingly original. Certainly, these authors do not hold back from exploring the wider significance of their proposed interpretations, but there is a wealth of well-documented and rigorous argument here to support their contentions, and not a shred of evidence of -animus- against those whose views they dispute. A serious and significant book for everyone interested in animal cognition."
4,you get what you expect!,"This is THE book you want to read if you're a first time parent and don't have much experience with babies. You're given very practical explanations on how to deal with your newborn and it helps to solve all the simple troubles you go through everyday, from treating fever and skin rashes to deciding which toy to buy.It is very helpful up to 7/8 months of age of your child, then it becomes less accurate."
1,"Conservative, republican scare tactic book","Looking for a book that challenges your motherly instincts? Creates fear of childbirth? Makes you think of every worse case scenerio? This is the book for you! This book is given out by insurance companies, need I say more?If you are looking to find the meaningful and deep experience of pregnancy and parenting, look elsewhere. Ina Gaskin, William Sears to start."
3,Not what I expected!,"I have three children and most likely prego with #4. I can tell you a much better book is The Baby Book by Dr. William Sears and Martha Sears, RN. He is a Pediatrician, and they have had 8 children. They know what they are talking about!WTE has covered several areas in their books that I just don't feel they knew any or all the information. Their stance on diapers (cloth v disposable) was way off and they don't seem to have all info on breastfeeding, either.This was a great book at one time, because no one had written one. It was a much needed source. However, Dr. Sears and many other authors, now, exist and they have much better options! Check out books by Dr. Sears and see the other books that show up! Or check out the La Leche League website as they can refer you to many great parenting books."
3,"Well organzied, but biased.","I like the way this book is organized into easy to digest, month by month chapters, with separate sections for special issues. However, I have found the book limited in the child-rearing approaches the authors put forth. Issues such as when to wean from the breast, when to introduce solids, and co-sleeping are all dealt with in a pretty limited fashion. Instead of introducing a general overview of the different parenting philosphies (Attachment parenting, Ferberizing, etc) the authors present one method for dealing with such issues and move on. Obviously the book can't cover everything, but there's no reason why it can't be a springboard for further research and discussion. Instead there is little to no recognition given to other approaches. In that respect I have been disappointed with the book."
2,Ok- But you need to recognize the flaws,"This book is okay if it is not your only source of information. A lot of this info is incorrect but it is a handy tool if you have it on hand because you received it as a gift. I personally, would not waste my money on this book and would instead bookmark a few good parenting websites."
1,Nothing To Review,"I am sorry to say this, but there is nothing to review. This book never arrived. I even reordered it and it still didn't arrive, resulting in a refund. I have always had very good results ordering from Amazon, this was my first disappointment."
1,insulting and ridiculous,"I found it insulting that this book states that if I take a taste off my baby's spoon to get a new one for the baby. I'm the child's mother, am I really that germ filled? Does that mean we shouldn't kiss our babies so that we don't contaminate them? Also I don't see the harm in letting baby share your bed. And letting a little baby cry it out in their crib? Not my babies, NEVER. And once again they supply ridiculous diet recommendations. A sugarless first birthday cake? A little extreme I think."
3,Somewhat Helpful,"I found this book to begin to be helpful around month 4. I was offended by the section on whether on not to go back to work. If you are planning on returning to work, do yourself a favor and skip this chapter.I loved What to Expect When You Are Expecting so had high hopes, my expectations were not met. I did notice some inconsistencies with advice throughout the chapters, but overall I am glad that I own it."
2,"poorly organised, mostly unhelpful.",I find this book for the most part extremely unhelpful. The index is poorly organized. It always takes at least 10 minutes for me to find anything that I'm trying to look up. And then when I do the section often doesn't deal with what I'm trying to find out about. I do like the milestone sections at the beginning of each month. I also find it's overly alarmist views on anything vaguely different annoying. I had the same problem with What to Expect When You're Expecting. Basically it's a good guide if you wish to be overly cautious about your child and even then lots of info is missing.
1,I threw this book in the trash can... literally,"I didn't want any other parents getting their hands on it. I have several issues with this book. Their view on breastfeeding is that you should wean at age one or you will have problems. Even the AAP and World Health Organization recommends that you breastfeed for at least two years and let your baby self-wean. Also, they repeatedly call parents who won't let their babies cry it out 'soft'. If my baby is crying, I'm going to her: enough said. Also, they give only negatives and no positives to co-sleeping. I really liked their pregnancy book, but this one is garbage and I got the Dr Sears 'The Baby Book' instead."
2,"ok book, not the best by far","This book is just ok. It gives factual information in a bland way, but does not take a stand on any issue. The feel I got from this book was that it read like - It is ok if you want to breastfeed, and its ok if you want to bottle feed, whatever you want. It seemed to me really not to say anything at all, it did not take a stand on what was right to do. Every subject seemed to end with ""its probably ok, but maybe it isnt so you better call the doctor"". Too wishey-washey to be of any real use."
4,New parents need this book.,"You're pregnant. The first thing I did was read every book I could get my hands on. This one will help you be prepared. This is the bible for parents of new babies ... what to expect on everything from health, to behavior, to milestones. I've went back to this book countless times for help. This is one I recommend every new parent own."
3,Useful guide,"I had this book for my daughter when she was an infant going on to toddler. I bought it 13 years later for my sister. It is useful, concise and writen in easy to read language. I would recommend it as a shower gift."
1,Great book for budding neurotic parents...,"If you want to begin your adventure out as parents constantly feeling like your child is not achieving the over-generalized ""milestones"" in this book, then buy this book.In all honesty, while this book has some value, the negativity you are going to feel welling up because your four month old isn't doing pushups or rolling over or eating solid foods or whatever the book says is supposed to be happening isn't worth it.My advice: Enjoy your baby. Talk to your doctor if something seems very amiss. Otherwise, let your kid grow up. Chances are pretty good things will turn out OK without consulting this book."
1,Patronising,A patronising and badly organised mish-mash.Some of the worst illustration I have ever seen in a book
1,Prepare youself for feelings of inadequacy,"The only thing I found helpful about this book was in information on immunizations. This book did not support any of the choices and decisions that I was (am) making as a parent. I have chosen to breastfeed beyond one year (as the AAP and the WHo suggest) and this book gives the impression that nursing a toddler is absurd. The same goes for holding my baby, parenting her to sleep, and co-sleeping. This book, like it's predecessor, What to Expect When Expecting, made me feel very inadequate as a mother and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Paranoia books,"I strongly dislike both What to Expect when You're Expecting and What to Expect the First Year. We are very interested in natural childbirth and attachment parenting (gentle parenting) and I just thought both of these books are filled with much poor advice. Certainly everyone has their own parenting styles and preferences, but for two books that SOO many people have, I think there are many better books out there. (Dr. Sears books I think are WAY better than these)"
3,A Good Start,"I have found a lot of helpful suggestionsin the book but I certainly don't think it's the ONLY book to have on hand. I really liked the milestone markers, the way it had questions that real mom's would ask, and great first-aid advice. It's a great book if you're a run of the mill parent, but if you're looking for any ""alternative"" support (like questioning vaccines, using homeopathy, or are into attachment parenting) than this book isn't for you."
5,Pleased,"I bought this book for my daughter in law 3 years ago when she was pregnant with our first grandchild. She loved it, she is now pregnant with the 2nd child and has used it many times to explain to the 3 year was the new baby sister looks like that is growing in mommy's stomach. Very informative."
1,Go with Dr. Sears instead!,"If you want a comprehensive, common-sensical book on baby's first year, don't waste your money on this one. Dr. Sears ""The Baby Book"" is much better and as a parent, made me feel more at ease."
4,Great reference book!!!!!,This is a great reference book for first time moms. I like how I can go to each month and see what to expect or to know my child is right on track. Great sections on how to handle any emergencies and boo-boos. Some things were repetative if you read the 1st one...What to Expect when you are expecting. Overall great book
4,"What to expect the First Year, Second Edition","A good book, easy to find information and easy to read.Useful book for parents. I recommand others to read."
2,"Take some of their advice, and throw some out","Seems like everyone told me I had to have this book and the What to Expect When you're expecting - I found the same for both - there was some value in some of the advice, but some I completely disagree with - don't be afraid to completely reject some of the advice. I hope new moms don't have only this book to rely on. Make sure you have other sources because these definitely have some aweful advice in them too."
3,Instilling the fear ...,"While these types of books are fairly well informative, they also instill fear into expecting mothers. What happened to our mothers and our mothers mothers? They didn't have books like this and yet they still managed quite well to do things naturally and based on instinct. For the most part, we all turned out well. These books make people paranoid to the extent that they are worried about whether they can even do ANYTHING whilst pregnant. I certainly am not going to worry about what I can or can't eat (my mother ate normally), whether I'm able to use certain skin creams (in the old days - if you had to, you had to) etc. I will use common sense and not be scared to breathe by these books. Women; make your own decisions and things will work out as good if not better. Use this book as only a guide, but don't feel you have to do exactly as they say."
3,Not so good,A lot of information to read but very dry text and you get boarded in 10 minutes. At the end you get something but the feeling is not satisfying!
1,Different item sold than what was stated,"Seller stated that it was the second edition and sent us the first and older edition and told us in a note that it was the same information as the second edition. If I would have known this I would have not purchased it and would have purchased what I wanted, which was the newest edition, the second edition."
3,A okay resource book,I read this book from time to time but its not my favorite. I think there are better ones out there.
1,Too opinionated; not enough facts,"There's some good information in this book, but nothing that you couldn't find at webmd.com, mayoclinic.com or - ASK YOUR PEDIATRICIAN!!!The book is opinionated and condescending, and is not entirely factual. It lists information for prevention of illnesses that simply is not factual.There is a lot of good basic information that is true but can be found almost anywhere else, but most importantly, through your child's physician.Save your money and make the most of your Dr.'s appointments."
4,"Much, much better than the earlier edition!","Most of the reviews listed are for the 1st edition, and I think that is very deceptive. The 2nd edition contains significantly different information, especially on the topic of breastfeeding. It is also more friendly to AP-methods of parenting. I'm quite happy with this edition, and would definitely recommend it."
3,Not quite as good as the last novel.,"Bernard does nothing but mope about Fiona the whole time, but in the end it looks like Bernared won't be her victum anymore."
3,"Must read as a series; a dry, Brit, espionage mystery","Found this mystery lacking in the ""page turner"" department, though the British characters come to life and the pieces finally fall into place at the end. A post-Cold War setting between Berlin, Warsaw and London creates a confusing but lively backdrop for espionage and romance.The book is part of a series, therefore, reading ""Hope"" as a ""stand alone"" may confuse the reader. Best parts are the descriptions of former, wealthy, Polish estates and the relationship between Samson, Volkmann and Hening.Theresa T. Vail"
2,Average,"Let me start by saying that this whole series is best suited to be read in order. I picked one up here and there and in doing so mixed the order up. What that meant is that I had to do a little extra thinking at times and on some books the light bulbs went off for some of my earlier questions. I also think these books are best suited to someone that is looking for a real characters driven spy story and not a action packed James Bond shoot em up. Deighton is a writer, therefore he spends time getting to know the characters, their personalities - what they are thinking, not just when they are reloading their gun. This being said I did think this book could have used a bit more action to punch it up, get the pace up a notch or two. Overall it is a good, solid book that gives you a decent amount of entertainment."
2,Deighton meets D. Gilman,"Well, how to start?I used to be a fan of Mr. D. stories until now. I'm Polish and the area covered by ""Hope"" is familiat to me and yet something has sounded wrong from the very beginning. It is not a sense of English humor. I enjoy it. It was the reality of Communist Poland in the waning '80, presented by Deighton. Briefly, it is BS in plain words. I have completed first 66 pages and gave in. Enough is enough. If it were Fleming and J. Bond, I would understand. There are no excuses. ""Hope"" is hopeless. I have given 2 stars for some dialogues which are still vivid and funny."
5,Great Product,"I bought this to replace an old one that had rusted to the point that I could not repair it. I was very pleased at how easy it was to install. It works great and it is easy to find repair parts for it when it starts to leak in the future. Be sure to get the right length for your area. Mine is a foot longer than I needed, but like the extra length. You need to purchase it based on the depth you need to bury it. For example a 3 foot is designed to be buried three foot into the ground, it will be 3 foot long plus the length you need to bury it. I was confused and thought it was based on how high you want it from the ground up, so just keep that in mind."
1,3 out of 5 aint bad???,Ok if you don't mind digging them back out every couple of years. 2 of the 5 we put in two years ago started leaking at the drain valve which is 4 feet deep in the ground in our case. Incidently the 3 that don't leak we hardley use. I am looking for a different brand.
4,to short,"to short to bury it 3 ft.but it works great,just order the taller ones.six more words required it says.there.how bout now?k done"
4,All patients should read,Well organized and illustrated. Especially helpful for early stages of diagnosis and in meeting family member's concerns. I wish I'd had it sooner.
2,kindle edition has major flaws,"I bought the kindle edition but was very frustrated by the sloppy conversion from the printed version. tables are hard to read, many are cut off and large chunks of text are invisible! So I bought the paperback because the content is great. Turns out there are a lot of points where they have used colored text, which doesnt show at all on the kindle! charts are also fine on the paperback version, just sloppy conversion and obviously not checked. dont buy the kindle version."
2,Great idea--bad execution,"The software installed easily. I soon discovered that many advertised features did not work with Outlook 2000. Franklin has since upgraded the software with a patch available on the internet. I recently upgraded the software which has now turned hot sync into a nightmare. Addresses are deleted from my contact list. Bogus entries titled 'unnamed' are entered into my palm. Some appointments are deleted, some are duplicated.I am on the verge of uninstalling the software and using something else. Don't waste your money and time. Buy something else."
1,Pass on this and save yourself some heartache,"I bought this and really wanted it to work for me. Nothing but heartache. I installed the first time, had a ton of problems, then uninstalled it out of disappointment, and which caused even more problems, which led me to have to completely uninstall all of my Palm software plus reinstall Outlook 2000 to get back to where I was before I started.Amazingly, when they came out with an updated version, I tried again, with similar, though not as disastous results, mostly because I pulled the plug on the product before it could do much more damage. I have the CD sitting in my drawer, and I look at wistfully because I want it to do what it promises, but it just doesn't work."
2,Not simple,I have only used this in a Covey Store. Besides the fact that the store employee did not know how to use the software - I found the schedular/appointments narrow. You had to accept a time of duration. When I wanted to print out a weeks worth of appointments it would only print one side - no double sided printing like I have in my current Daytimer 97. Not the quality I thought it would be.
1,Not Enough Information in Description,"The web information never explained the switch only works with 3-wire connections. It was useless for me, when it arrived."
2,"Not backlit,hard to see and program","Had no trouble installing.It did fit into my original switchbox.My trouble is in the programming.The display is LCD, not backlit and small.Does it work? I might not ever know."
2,Couldn't get this to work,"I bought this to replace a ""manual"" timer on an outdoor light switch but I could never get it to work and got conflicting info from Honeywell and the merchant. I returned it and got a credit."
4,"definite step up from the plug in, adds versatility","Not every room has plug in lamps. I like this because it allows me to program a ceiling light. Takes a few minutes to setup, and you have to make sure you are set to AM/PM correctly, but once it is set it is good to go."
4,good for water-heater pump,"It's a very good design, and so far (couple of weeks) ,it's working great. It was easy to set up and does the job for us. It required an electrician to install, since it needs both wires and an Electrician has to bring in a second wire, since most keys only have the hot wire, and not both ."
4,Excellent timer. Just set it and forget about it.,Great product. No more having to run to the garage to turn on and off the christmas lights. And no more forgetting the lights on.
5,Easy installation and perfect operation,"I got two - one for a vent and one for the entrance light (outside the front door). The timer was very easy to install instead of the existing switch.It's easy to program (whether for a different time every day, or for the same hours throughout the week). I had both timers for 6 months now and they work perfectly. I love how you can still use it as a switch without impacting programing at all.The only downside (truly minor) is it doesn't adapt to daylight saving time, but after it misses for a day or two you realize it's another clock you forgot about...Overall, great product!!!"
3,dang its big,"just wanted to emphasize that the thing is BIG, it barely barely fits into a standard box, and really doesn't if the wires coming in to the box take up any real room - we couldn't install the thing without redoing the whole box and drywall around it, which wasn't worth it :("
3,Worked great until the internal battery died,"worked great until 3+ years later. bought it august, 9 2009. failed a week or two ago. worked great for those 3 years and now i need to buy and install a new one. this is unacceptable if you're installing it for a homeowner/customer. since it's my own switch it doesn't bother me as much, but if i were installing it for someone else i would be quite annoyed that it only lasted 3 years."
1,don't buy,"Basically, agree with other reviews that this product is defective. After 22 months, this switch gave up. Contact Aube, they asked me to mail in first. Consider the life span of this item, I may just throw away."
4,Programmable timers saving us real money.,We installed these programmable times on the 120 v heat tape circuts on our roofs and gutters. Our home has hard wired heat tapes which could only be mannually turned on and off. The various heat tape circuts require different run times due to roof area and sun exposure so having the programmable times allows us to run each independently as needed rather than on in the morning and off at night. We are also able to make multiple programs for each circut and have programs for less snow or deep snow so far. Installation and programming were easy.
2,Requires a neutral wire.,"It may be a fine product, but it does require a neutral wire which may or may not exist depending on the age of your house. You should check your switch first before ordering these. I live in an older house, and none of the switches had the neutral cable. Supposedly, 3-way versions work without the neutral cable, but I can't comment on those. I ended up returning it and getting a timer outlet from a local hardware store."
1,Wrong product was shipped,"I ordered Aube TI033 which is compatible with CFL. What I received is Honeywell PLS530, which is different and not compatible with CFL."
5,Programmable timer works the way we want it to!,Too much ambient light in the area to have a photocell turn a light on/of so this timer works perfectly for us!
5,Light Wall Switch Timer,"Was looking for a wall switch timer for outdoor lights, but the existing switch was a 3-way. Told by electrician it was not possible. Searched Amazon and found this one - highly rated. Just installed it with no problems. Very satisfied."
5,Works with CFL bulbs,Needed a timer that didn't fail with my fluorescent bulbs. this has worked well for a few months now and the battery back up worked during a power outage. Programming is easy. Installation was fairly simple and the included instructions were fairly straightforward.
3,bulky device,"Works as stated. On installation, device is a little bulkier/deeper than expected and it took considerable pressure to get the device into the outlet box. Wire nuts came off twice and I had to re-attach them... especially difficult with the stiff wiring in the wall."
4,"Great, but dead battery after 3 years","Bought this Dec 2009. January 2013 the display is now blank - it looks like the internal battery is dead. The battery is not replaceable.I liked how well it worked that I am buying the same unit again as a replacement. If the battery lasted longer or was replaceable, I would give it 5 stars."
5,Honeywell Aube TI033 works as described,I have 3 of these at my house and they work great. Two of them are almost about one year old. I purchased a GE brand and it died in less than six month. I would recommend this product.
2,Doesn't spill because nothing comes out!,I have two of these cups. I've done everything to make the milk come out faster but even when I suck on them milk or juice just dribbles out. When I totally take out the insert fluid just pours out non stop but when you put the plastic insert in hardly anything comes out. I tried cutting the hole in the insert wider but that doesn't work. Very frustrating cup. I wound up switching back to the Munchkin Mighty Grip. Works great.
1,Dangerous Sippy Cup,"I bought two for my 3-year-old son and 1-year-old son about 3 months ago. Few weeks ago, I found one of the soft spout broken and found a piece in my younger son's month. I stopped to let him use it immediately. I thought he bit it so that the spout was broken. However, it happened again to my elder son's cup last week. He never bit or chew it, but the spout still broken apart. It should be some problem with the spout material. I am glad they were not chocking by this product and going to report it."
1,Art and Architecture in Russia,"I'm very disappointed in this book. Except for the cover, there is not a single colored picture. The text is difficult both because it is too technical and because the type is too small. For a $30 soft cover book, I expected stunning pictures of Russia's fascinating architecture and art, accompanied by interesting text. Each museum in Russia has a beautiful, full color book at a much lower cost than this one. If you get to Russia, make sure you buy everything you want there, because there seems to be nothing comparable available in this country."
4,G1 Voyager Starscream,"This Target Exclusive Starscream is faithful to the original F-15, however, it comes with Thundercracker's head giving it somewhat of a personality disorder. A must have for the collectors, at any rate."
5,Great Soundtrack,After seeing the movie I HAD to get the music! Couldent find it anywhere except Amazon.
3,Great....But Something's Missing,"The Foxfire Soundtrack is perfect in that the music was very well-chosen for the movie. The album alone, however, leaves something to be desired. It's biggest drawback is that Mazzy Star's ""Into Dust"" (from the tattoo scene) is missing. ""I Don't Want to Think About It"", ""You"", and ""Me and My Charms"" alone make the album worth buying. The remaining tracks are primarily songs that would be fun with friends once or twice and then fade out. I suppose I'm glad that I bought this CD, but if you're not in love with the tracklist, I'd bet you could find something a bit more rewarding."
2,Disappointing,"This was sad. It was impossible not to like the author of this book, or believe that she sincerely wanted to make shopping easier for busy people. Therefore I feel guilty in reporting that I found this book very thin and unhelpful, with few recipes and advice that I can't believe I paid for, like ""subscribe to the Sunday paper for coupons"". If you need to buy this book to know you should use coupons to save money at the grocery store you are in more trouble than this woman can get you out of! I commend her on supporting 4 kids when her husband's an artist and she's a musician and now homemaker, but I hope she plans on sending me some supplimentary recipes, because I feel cheated out of 9 bucks after buying her book! (just think of all the food I could've bought with that!)"
3,"Good Money-Saving Ideas, Recipes Questionable","While Rhonda's book is much healthier than her book that is similar than this one (Eat Well instead of Eat Healthy) I found some of her recipes leaned toward the sweet end of tastes. I had never heard of using ketchup in a pizza sauce before and really felt that there could have been a better recipe that did not use the ketchup, or the additional added sugar that is stated in the recipe. In addition, I am not a Miracle Whip fan. I prefer real mayonnaise, I guess that is my own personal taste. I also felt that she could have been a little more creative in some of her ideas instead of quoting dozens of other resources. I bought her book thinking it was her ideas, not other books or newsletters. Oh well, I guess I'll have to buy some of those others since they seem to be mentioned frequently."
1,"More accurate if the title did not contain the word ""Healthy.""","I have never reviewed a product on Amazon, negative or otherwise, but I could not get past the shopping list on the 4th page.The title of the book is ""Eat HEALTHY for $50 a Week.""I realize it was written in the mid-90s (before the big movement to bring awareness to the dangers of high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils) but come on, even I knew then (as a 16 year old) that canned fruit, fruit loops, white sugar/flour, boxed mac and cheese, and lemonade mix (um, basically more white sugar) barely qualifies as actual ""food"" let alone healthy food.Such a sad read.We eat well on a pretty tight budget but I was hoping for a few more tools, or new ideas.Save your money, skip the book, and eat lots of brown rice and beans for meals and nuts and fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks instead of expensive, packaged white flour snacks and both your body and your wallet will be better off."
3,Transformations,"Made in 2002 for Pennsylvania public television. Perservationists can justly applaud these conversions of train stations to alternate uses. The film, however, is primarily talking heads congratulating themselves for a job well-done and promoting the businesses therein. Very little of the actual renovations is shown and even less of the station's history: we don't even learn what lines most of these served. The occasional historic photos are not identified; why are all those people lining the tracks? This is a pleasant excursion, but I believe train buffs would be sorely disappointed. Of greatest value to groups and individuals seeking to save endangered landmarks."
4,Excellent,"This book was listed in ""good"" condition, but it's actually better than ""good"". It looked practically new. I am very please with it's condition and the book was delivered on time!"
3,Book review on Bugs Potter Live At Nickaninny,"The potter famaily and the vedda famaily bugs have planned to go on a summer trip to the Naka-mee-chee island. Bugs and Elizabeth do not want to go because they think it is going to be boring and waste there sumer vaction. Well they have to go and 5 days through there trip the toilet is missing and everybody thinks it is boring. Bugs loves rock music and brought along his CD player, and he loves his drums he is dying to play them so he steels some clothes and some pots and pans and makes a drum set. see what happens next by reading this book this book is full of lafter and it os halarious. You will truely enjoy this book!"
5,Disney Cars Launcher comes free with Clyde Waite order,Eveready Battery #E91BP-8 EVER 8PK AA Alkaline BatteryThis is our listing please look at pictures to see Lightning McQueen Launcher of Cars fame from Disney
1,A Disgrace to the Bomberman Franchise,"Act Zero means it deserves a Zero star rating. However, if I could give it zero stars, then I'd want to give it a negative star. It is without a doubt the worst Bomberman game in the franchise, surpassing the horrible Atomic Bomberman on the PC from the early '90s. The game suffers from unbearably long load times between rounds that interrupt any enjoy that could have been had for the 3rd person perspective.There is one reason, and only one, to try this game. It belongs on the list of all-time, worst video games with the likes of ET on the Atari 2600 and Superman for the N64. True gamers need to check these games out for themselves."
2,Do not buy this game!,"No story, no lives, no continues,you can't even save unless you're online...a LIVE!arcade game *AT BEST*"
3,Relax a minute,"Ok I have heard a lot of bad things about this game for critics and fellow gamers and during all this I keep thinking ""Aw come on be easy on it it's not that bad is it?"" Well I picked up a used copy for 3 bucks and to my suprise I was right it wasn't that bad. This game may be different from the rest of the series but that dosen't mean it's bad. I will at admit there are a few bad things:One life no continues and 99 levels come one, two the voice acting sucks, three the graphics are not to great oh and little to no plot .Good things:the music is ok,the weapons are pretty cool and even thought it is not the bomberman we all know and love he is pretty cool.So bottom line:THIS IS MY OPINION NOT FACT!!!!! and I say check it out but don't except to reach the end of the game."
2,Liberal Garbage,This is a very one-sided book by an obvious liberal. Some parts of the book are true but only one side of the story is portrayed.
3,Better Than Palm Desktop,"Franklin Covey, generally recognized as the leader in paper time management products and time management training, has yet to bring their software products up to the level of their overall reputation. Their software does a fairly good job of mimicing the paper-based Franklin Planner, but does not really capitalize on the fact that it's hosted on a computer platform, albeit small. The desktop software does a better job than the Palmtop, especially with respect to prioritizing tasks.I was somewhat disappointed in the product but do prefer it to the Palm software that came preloaded."
1,Justin Lookadoo--a clueless moron,"I don't even own this book, I read it at a walmart while shopping one day and it is so ridiculous I actually took pictures of some of the pages with my cellphone to laugh at with friends. This guy is so naive it's really quite funny. Don't buy this book, it is the most non-informational piece of trash I've seen on the subject of drugs out there. There are some really good informational books out there. Try Illegal Drugs by Paul M. Gahlinger PHD (search for it on Amazon) It's the best book I've seen out there on the subject.Oh and if this is the author Justin Lookadoo reading this review: Don't worry, everyone has a talent. Maybe writing just isn't yours...Or maybe you should write about things you have knowledge or experience about. That might bring you bigger success."
4,The complete Leopard 1 reference,"This book is the main Leopard book you need. It covers the development of the first Lepard 1 in 1965, and gives you all the details of the version up to the Leopard 1A5. I also covers foreign versions and other versions made with the Leopard chassis. It includes colorful illustrations from Michael Badrocke, on of Britain's leading illustrators of military and other high-tec equipment.The only reason why this book only got 4 starts, was because the rest of the book is only in black-and-white.But the information is worth it for a Leopard 1 enthusiast!"
5,A Heart Like God's,This was an excellent study on the life and trials of David. And is totalally relatable to modern day life. I highly reccomend this study guide.
5,Delighted to find all 3 gems in 1 hardback,"I have read (more than once) all three of these books separately and I keep purchasing them and passing them on to others... I was thrilled when I visited Amazon.com and found them to be all in one hardback. St. James isn't necessarily telling us anything we may not have already contemplated, but she is giving us an opportunity to focus on the concept. Each time I feel my life picking up a treadmill pace I retreat to a quiet corner with her books in an effort to take me back to where I really want to be. All three of these books have been constant companions since each of them were published.Not all of her suggestions may be of use to a reader, but these are not textbooks--they are ideas to stimulate the thought process of life simplification. The wise reader will sift through St. James suggestions and design their future to fit their life and their needs."
1,Don't waste your time or hard earned money...,"This book has very little valuble suggestions, and some are, to quote another review, rediculous! The wise reader will read this book and find that it has very little practicle advice to fit any lifestyle. It is truley amazing what can get published these days. I also recommend it to nobody."
4,Noize,"While many are ambivalent about this CD I think it is good. It reminds me of all the happy hardcore raves I have been to and the memories are good. The music while at times dull and repetitive, is at other times the most mind shatteringly incrediable music you ever will experince. But after all it's just a CD, so just buy it and take a listen yourself."
1,Elevator music,"I got this CD after being told that it was Happy Hardcore, good for working to, and interesting to listen to. I found that it is nervewracking, uninteresting and completely banal. Talk about elevator music!"
5,Low literacy and health,An excellent book on the low literacy levels of certain populations. It is a well written and easy to read narrative. A great buy!
5,Great Book,This book was very enlightening. I'm glad that my instructor introduced the book to the class. Great read for someone interested in literacy.
2,Not a George Cartoon,"This is just a group of stories read to a slide show, of which Curious George is one. It's not animated. Had I know I would have wated for the PBS release."
3,Doesn't work on my computer,"I had this game as a child and loved it. I played it so much, one of the scenes didn't work any more. I recently found the old one but it was so scratched it wouldn't work. I bought this one hoping to bring back some memories but it said it won't work on a 64 bit computer. I'm not a big computer person but is there any way I could make it work? Or is there one I can buy that will?"
1,Bad!,"This book didn't help me one bit. I do carve wook, but figuring out what this author was trying to show, was a bit difficult. I shall carve my own...........aleady have the wood."
2,Interesting Starting Point,"My problem is likely that I expected more from this book. A PhD writing about conflict and commonality of Pagans and Christians could have been much better, as it's not a field of scholarship well-delved into at this time. However, Dr. diZerega's PhD is in political science, not religion and philosophy, and his arguments are not terribly well-formed. I found his outlook on both Christianity and Paganism to be narrow at worst, naive at best.If you wish to read this, do so with a critical eye."
1,The lefts answer to Rush Limbaugh,"You have two choices as far as Gus is concerned. Either you agree with him 100% and you treat him as your profit, then you are alright. If you disagree with him a little or a lot (doesn't matter how much) or point out a fact to him and then you are a right wing fascist nut job. Two choices, take his word as gospel or commit heresy. Try writing him an email critical of something he said or post a blog comment pointing out a fact. See what happens. I did, and didn't like the result. As others have pointed out the book is at best flawed. The author is worse."
5,Works fine,"I expected a data cable, and they delivered it. It works fine, but its not just a data cable its a USB charger as well and when you get all this for 1 cent, it doesn't get any better. Probably the best deal you will find on internet."
4,Good fit for vu920,It is a perfect fit for my new ATT Vu920 phone. I used it to download music to my cell. Best price I can find.
5,Gets the job done!,"Phone used with: LG CU920 (Vu)I have had no trouble with this product at all. Item appeared to be shipped new, and the fit was a little snug at first, but it wore in nicely. Never had any difficulty connecting to computer."
1,Cable Cord for LG VX9400,This came and never worked. I tried to use it for my LG VX 9400 and my computer never recognized it when I plugged it in. I also had to fight the company for a replacement thinking that I had just been sent a bad cord but the second one never did anything either. Do not buy from them! This is a waste of money and obviously does not work with the phones listed.
1,Cheap...Beware,"Product is of VERY LOW quality. The tip broke off the first time I inserted it into the phone. Don't buy, your getting what you are paying... Pretty much nothing!"
5,good,So far it seems to be working fine. Haven't had any problems. (knock on wood) The usb feature allows me to use the charger on my old phones wall plug in which is convenient.
2,Not a data cable,This is not a data cable. Could not use it with the software I had (wanted to be able to change themes and messaging tones). I can however use it to charge the phone and load music and wallpapers onto the MEMORY CARD I have in my phone.
3,You need more than the cable for a CU920,"The cable is great and does everything described here. The problem is no software comes with it. It isn't too hard to find with a quick google search. Even after you get that, though, you cannot transfer any to or from the phone, only micro sd cards in the phone. I'm having to copy each picture from my CU920 one at a time to an SD card and then to my computer. Very tedious."
3,Kind of works,This works pretty well though sometimes disconnects for no reason. It was a good deal for this price. Sometimes I have to angle the connector into the phone just right for it to work. The product shipped to me was not made by LG which is fine by me however I suspect the official cord would out preform this one.At the end of the day for this price it does work well enough.
1,Data Cable,Did not work for my computer or phone. My brother actually purchased this so I have no idea what he did with it. So this review is based on what he has said. But to future buyers: Just be sure your phone will be compatible for this.
4,Must need!,"Thank goodness I found this item on amazon for that amazing price. Without it I wouldnot have been able to transfer all my pictures, videos and data to my computer. I received it on time and in good condition. Will recommend this to all."
3,"Can't really comment, but still will","I bought this to see if I could sync my Virgin Mobile Flare. I think virgin mobile disabled this connector except for charging (which this cable won't do either). I suspect it's not the cable, but rather virgin mobile's phone, so keep that in mind."
4,Just what I needed,"I had just got a new pair of LG Vu phones and this cable allows me to Sync music and download games, ringtones, and pictures as well as connect using phone modification programs.There are some cables that will only work as a charger but this Data cable works perfectly"
2,vue cable,Software that came with the cable was labeled for several LG phones - mine not included. Found a driver on line and it works - but more than I should have had to do.This seller was good and shipped to the US Virgin Islands (part of the US!). Amazon will not ship most items here - a ridiculous policy they should change...we are on the US postal service!!
1,little to no information,"This product needs some kind of driver (that is not available separately) to actually be able to use it as advertised. After buying the cable it seems that the company may have gotten complaints. Now when I did a search for the same product, it comes with the cd driver that actually makes this product work. I am very upset and disappointed with the lack of information needed to make an educated decision on this purchase. Be careful and make sure it comes with the driver to make it work!!"
1,Didn't work,Bought this to download pictures from my phone and it didn't work. Very dissapointing. Even made sure it was for the correct cell phone.
1,DOA,"Plastic trim around plug wouldn't let it fit fully in my VX8350, though I've used similar cables before. Better yet, the connector broke away from the housing when I tried to unplug it, so I had to remove it with tweezers. Cable was basically DOA."
1,Driver for the usb cable don't work to transfer from pc to phone,"The cable that i received was damage and wont work. The second cable they send me the cable was ok, but i could never transfer files from my pc to my phone because the driver did not work at all. I try all the directions and step the seller told me but it wont work. I was expecting that it was more easy and simple to work with."
4,LG cu575 USB Data Cable,"Pros: Great price (I paid $2.99 ~ incl. S&H;), Works w/a lot of LG phones (I have 3 different models)Cons: Only good for charging phone & syncing music to the device via computer, not for transferring other files ~ like pics to or from the camera, but I guess that's more of an issue with the phones that I have rather than with the cable itself."
2,Frustrating...Doesn't even work anymore...,"This cord was great for a while and it was nice to be able to transfer music from my computer to my phone and pictures from my phone to my computer, but after using it three or four times it won't connect very well. Sometimes I can get it to connect for a few seconds, but I have to push it in really hard and hold it. And actually that's almost more frustrating because then I start to transfer data and it cuts off in the middle and doesn't finish the download. Grrr...I wouldn't recommend this particular cord."
4,"Good, works as advertised","No complications, works as advertised, eleiminates the need to open the battery compoartment of the LG Vu everytime I neeed to transfer something from the MicroSD Card."
3,LG Vu Data Cable,"IMPORTANT: To my knowledge, this data cable will not do anything for your LG Vu unless you have the memory card to go with it!!!! I have tried every thing under the sun to get the phone to show up as a device in MY COMPUTER so I can get pictures from phone as well as upload music and photos. Pretty sure you need the memory card that plugs in under sim card along with this cable."
5,Perfect for transferring data from PC to Cell Phone,A seperate cable I received as part of a bundle acccesory package was only for charging my phone through a USB port. I ordered this cable and was able to transfer files from my PC to Cell phone as indicated.
5,great price,this was a great deal and it is used so much that i dont know how i waited for it easy to use and store in your pocket or laptop bag came in very fast and was exactly what i was looking for and needed highly recommend it to anyone that has purchased this phone
1,sent wrong cable sent email no answer yet! sending new,"hi i wrote to co about getting wrong item,i ordered data cable for lg vu and got software for chocolate and does not work with my phone and only shows lg chocolate not and otherlg phones as stated in add? please send right item ,or i will return entire order,this is second email!!!

1,Does not charge phone,This cable does not provide charging capabilities for your phone from your computer USB port. In fact it drains the battery if left plugged in. Bargain Cell DOES NOT return email or calls.
2,Does NOT fit the LG 800g,"I bought this cord in order to use an SD card in my new cell phone without having to remove the battery to do so, and Amazon directed me to this cord when I said I was looking for one to fit an LG 800g. It doesn't fit my phone...and neither does the other usb adapter I already had. Be very careful when choosing a cord for your cell, one size does not fit all."
2,Env USB Charger,I like the USB cord but I was not happy that it had come so late. It came two days after the original arrival date.
5,"Great product, works perfect","The product did exactly what it was supposed to do. For everyone who has been confused about the drivers, simply set your phone to mass storage."
2,LG PC Sync doesn't work,"Got this to copy all my outlook contacts. But the LG PC Sync software provided with the data cable could not connect to my mobile lg vu c920.That sucks....Otherwise u can use BITPIM or EFS software to read files, images, copy ringtones etc...data cable is only helpful for that..."
1,does not work as i had hoped,it works but not as a real connection to what is already on drive to remove items and sometimes i cant add or remove so it is iffy
4,Simple. Affordable. Works Great.,"I ordered this cable for my LG Vu about three months after purchasing the phone. It works great. Once you connect the phone to the cable and the cable to the computer, allow the new hardware to be found and your off and running. I can transfer pictures to and from my phone easily, put my videos on the computer, and sync music. It really makes the phone so much more versatile. Great product."
1,It doesn't work.,"I tried to use this for the Vx5400. Initially, I thought perhaps it was my lack of tech-savviness, but I found professionals to assist me and they couldn't get this thing to work either. Very disappointed in my purchase."
1,Crap,Horrible. I just got it in the mail today. I used it once and it broke. It is very very fragile. You almost can't use it unless your very careful and precise.1/10
2,"Charges, but nothing else","Though I installed the included software disc, I could not get the phone and computer to communicate. The phone does charge, but that is all. No good if you can't transfer files, or tether to the computer for internet access."
3,"Worked okay, but additional software is needed","I purchased this, as I needed to upgrade my LG Voyager to an iPhone. I dreaded transferring all of my pictures manually. This didn't allow me to transfer my contacts and photos, as additional software was needed for a driver. However, it did allow me to keep my phone plugged into the computer continuously charging as I tediously emailed every picture from my phone to my email address MANUALLY. Otherwise, I would have had to charge the phone multiple times. Glad I have an iPhone now so everything is cloud based and accessible."
1,Defective,Cable almost destroyed my computer. Not a data cable for my LG Cu920 fone. Shut my computer down when connected with phone.
5,Brand New USB Data Cable for Lg,"That what I bought ""Brand New USB Data Cable for Lg Lg Vu Cu920, Shine Cu720, Venus Vx8800, Voyager Vx10000, Cu515, Vx5400, Rumor, Scoop, Ux260, Cg180, Ce110, Vx8350, Lx160, Flare, Ax380 Wave, Ux380, Cu575 Trax, Vx8550 Chocolate, Lx570 Muziq, Ax565, Ux565, Ax275, Vx8700, Vx9400, Vx9900 Env, Lx150, Vx8600, Ax8600, Vx8500 Chocolate Cell Phone""So, It was first time trying to buy something through Amazon.com, I found is very easy and good prices, and planning to do all my future purchases through Amazon.Thank you AMAZON.COM."
3,"Great for music, but hard to figure out","It's great for transfering music files to your phone, but haven't figured it out for much else. It would be nice if it could be used to transfer pictures, but if it can they sure do not make it easy."
1,Could not get to work with LG VX9400,I could not see my LG VX 9400 when connecting with this cable. The included software does not support the VX9400. I could not find any software to make it work.
5,served the purpose,"We visited Disney World last week, (June 17-22). I read a recommendation from a parent to purchase ponchos before the trip. I found these and followed the advice. Boy, did we need it! It rained every afternoon. If I could have sold these I would have made a fortune. There were so many people who stopped me to ask where I bought them. I told them how much I saved buying ten of them for less than the price of three, in Disney stores. It served the purpose. We still have them to use later."
4,More Complex than One Hour but Amazing Anyway,"I, like Zac1183, listened to One Hour before this and when I first listened to this disc didn't think highly of it. It IS more difficult to get into and understand but after a few listens it comes back to you at all hours of the day. The unique fusion of funk, metal, progressive elements, is completely awesome, and the melodies are catchier than hell. The opening riff on ""!"" is amazingly powerful, and the chorus on ""People Passing By"" is memorable and beautiful. This disc should probably be listened to after One Hour so you can get a feel for the band, although they are both pretty different. Amazing music though."
2,Contrivances ruin sincerity,"Being a fan of progressive, I would try to find passages to enjoy in these consciously bombastic overtures. Too often however I am just rubbed the wrong way with his approach. Everything feels over-the-top bloated with Gildenlow. From his arrangements and lyrics, to production and singing, he rarely seems to know when he has overdone it, when his group is simply unequipped to portray the heaviness or intelligence the songwriting infers. Unfortunately, the few musical passages which do transcend the ego-cloud fogging this group prove what fans will often argue; that the band helps guide symphonic rock to ambitious places."
2,Not what I remembered,"I remember watching Art Linkletter's show when I was a kid and enjoying the interviews. It seems that things are never as good as you remember them, especially when it was a long time ago!"
4,Office humor at it's best...,"Well from what I can say, being an employee in the corporate environment, this book is pretty entertaining. A lot of the humor in this little ""guide"" seems like something out of the movie Office Space. It basically details how to do as little as possible, while getting credit for as much as possible, in the most humorous way. If you've ever worked, still work, or want to work in the corporate world, take a look at this for a quick laugh."
2,Read the American Girl doll books instead,"I liked the American Girl dolls and books, and had a couple, and Rose (now Rosa) by Magic Attic is a pretty doll... so I got the set a while back. Oh, ow, these books aren't nearly as well done as the American Girl books. That said, maybe what to me seems cheesy and shallow is fun and appealing for those of today's girls who are not interested in the lively, well researched, well illustrated historical books that go with the American Girl dolls. There is also a Dear America series, which is a bit harsher. If one thinks that the American Girl books are too ""sweet,"" perhaps try them. But I'd sooner read almost anything than these dreadful Magic Attic books."
2,Read This Before You Read The Book,"I thought this was a self-help book. I got into the book believing that I was going to come out with something, a self renewal, an awakening, knowing that I wasn't the only one that has gone through the things the main character is going through,... What a disappointment!... What she doesn't realize is how many unsuspecting woman are going to be fuming when they get to the end of this book. The character Nora is a connieving liar, and why the author just didn't write the book revolving around her I don't know? Why did she have to get us involved in believing that at the end of the book not only I, but anyone who reads this book would have a new outlook, to realize that you can't believe her or the book from the beginning to the end...."
3,Don't expect too much,"OK I know this is fiction, and this was a fairly good book, but it left me wanting more and with a lot of unanswered questions. It read like a soap opera towards the end which felt abrubt to me. Some of the characters seemed to ""perfect"" - especially Greg. Overall I would recommend it as a good read, but don't expect to come out of it feeling empowered by the main character. The story was just not developed enough."
3,kind of boring,"i just finished reading this book and was that impressed. it was sort of slow. the end was so short and left me with questions about the characters. i think it could've been written a different way. it's not the worst book i've ever read, but it's not one of my favorites."
2,I DID NOT ENJOY THIS BOOK,"I liked the concept, but the characters were just plain dull. I was one hundred pages in, and I was thinking, ""I just don't care about these people."" I'm a big believer in self-help and empowerment, but this story was dry and boring. And the part with Camille in the club bawling was just too sappy. It was like a scene from a teen movie of the week. I believe women like Camille exist and need to be heard. The story idea was promising, but the execution left much to be desired. And what was so empowering about the ending? Her decision was contrived and stereotypical. Another ""strong Black woman striking out on her own"" wrap-up."
2,He is just showing off his badges.,"Sure, it is great the guy came up with products that we all know, but anyone could who knows the president's of major companies. Really this book toots his own horn without giving advice. If you like the type of invention book that shows you nothing but cute little quotes, then this buy this book. OTherwise, don't bother."
3,A good place to start.,"For those who are considering inventing for a living, this is a nice book to have. It is also useful for individuals in organizations who need to or would like to innovate. The book is a quick read and does not go into any subject area deeply, although it does provide a nice overview of inventing. For the most part, the author illustrates concepts by presenting anecdotes from his distinguished career as an inventor. Changes are you will learn some things, but will probably look to additional sources for more information."
5,Great Book with Common Sense Advice on Inventing,This book gave me a new perspective on many different ways to get an idea to market. Mr. Mason's methods are based on good ole fashioned common sense. He has many success stories which make the book very enjoyable.
4,A Wonderful Trio recording great music,"The Peabody Trio is one of the best trios today. I had the opportunity to see them perform live recently and they did a fantastic job with genuine professionalism.Though they perform and travel often, they do not have many recordings, which is really unfortunate. This recording is of two of Beethoven's trios, Opus 70, Nos. 1 and 2.The first Trio is in D Major and was nicknamed ""The Ghost"" because of the low, eerie trills in the piano during the second movement. The second is in E-flat major and has four movements.I am no sound expert, but I find the recordings to be of good quality. The artists are superb collaborators, which is necessary for any chamber ensemble. I cannot compare it to other Beethoven Trio recordings out there (there are many), but I am certain that this is a great recording. You can't go wrong with this one. Beethoven fans and/or chamber music buffs will especially enjoy this CD."
4,Nice Product for Magellan,"This product has made my Explorist 210 GPSr MUCH more functional and useful, especially for hiking. However, it isn't that intuitive to use -- given that these are all Magellan products you would think you wouldn't have to convert data formats two times, but you do. Oh well, I like the final product a lot."
2,two severe limitations,"The software seems good with the exception of two major limitations that make it unusable for me.1. You cannot upload more than one region at a time to the gps. Previous versions allowed multiple regions. If you are going to travel to more than one destination or a route along a large diagonal area, this will not allow you to load adequate data to the gps.2. You must keep the cd in the computer in order to use the product. Normally this may be ok, but if you have a laptop with no CD drive, this makes it unusable on the road. If you cannot use it on the road then updating the gps with new regions is impossible.I will be using the old versions that allow multiple routes and have no severe limititations even if the data is not as accurate. I would buy another product if I found one that suited my needs and was compatible with my SportTrak Pro."
1,Poor Customer Support,"I like the product, used previous version, but with Mapsend 3D you must have CD in drive to use. I tried to make a backup (ever had a CD go unreadable), and could not. E-mailed Magellan and got this reply:The licensing verbiage in DirectRoute version 2.xx and higher (and any other newer MapSend products) has been changed to NOT allow the customer to make a backup copy of the CDs. Basically any new version of our mapping products that have Tages security will not allow the user to run a backup copy and the licensing agreement (which is agreed to when you select ""I agree"") does not allow making copies. We do not supply free backup copies of the CDs. Copies are not allowed per our licensing agreement with our data provider.I wrote back to tell them what I thought of their support and was told that if I could provide proof of purchase, I would be sent another CD for only $31.Magellan has lost me as a customer."
4,works well,"I would definitely recommend this software (I am using it with an Explorist 210). The maps are very up to date and have high detail of content. The only issue for hikers is that it does not contain trails. To work around this somewhat, I use Terrain Navigator to create a route of the trail I am going to hike, then convert it into Explorist/Mapsend compatible routes (using a free problem called GPSBabel). Then at least you can upload the trail as a proposed route and follow it on your GPS.Another issue for me was that 3-D mode is not working, which I am sure is related to my graphics card or some sort of computer problem. That itself is fine, my problem is more with extremely poor customer service. Their CS contacts are all in India (hello outsourcing) and completely clueless. All they can recommend is childish things as ""please reinstall"", "" did you check for viruses on your system"" and similar standard answers of a person that doesn't have a real answer."
3,Software was $10 with GPS unit.,Still learning how to use the software. It is loaded with options. I gave it 3 stars because I returned the software. Magellan had the software for 10 dollars if you bought the Explorist 500.
2,Lost in support,"I tried to load the product, but kept receiving a message that it would not load. I checked their website looking for a patch and it said that they shipped out defective disks in 12/05 and to call the company.I called the company and was told that since it is an old unit(SporTrak Pro) that I need to contact Legacy Products. Legacy only supports the handheld unit, NOT the disk. They couldn't understand that the GPS is fine, it was the disk that wouldn't load to the computer.I called Megellan back and customer service couldn't help, because I called the wrong department. I was told that I needed to call back and speak to a different department. When I followed their instructions, I heard a message to go to the website that started this problem.After 6 different people, in 30 minutes I found out that I need to speak to somebody in their Customer Resolution department, they'll send you a disk to repair the problem."
2,Misleading,"I'm a land surveyor, so when I saw the picture on the front of the box showing section lines, I thought this program would be a great way to help me navigate to section corners. It turns out the picture is misleading. Section lines are not available. When I called Magellan, I was told that the picture on the front of the box is ""for reference"" (whatever that means), and that what one would really see is shown on the back of the box. Too bad you can't see the back of the box on Amazon's product listing.There are quite a few obscure streams and ditches available, so I'll give it 2 stars, but I was pretty disappointed that it didn't provide me with what I thought I would be getting."
1,"Won't Show Topo, Won't Reload","The copy I received must be one of the defective ones Magellan distributed. It would not display the topo lines. It would not properly remove and could not be reloaded. Unless Magellan gets back to me soon it will be returned. Beware. Also, the box image in the listing is of the older MapSend Topo - not Topo 3D. Finally, take note that this vesion does not include Alaska (the old ""flat"" version did)."
4,3D Mapsend Topo Software,Works great on the Explorist 400. Has most of the new hairline roads so I can navigate myself while driving. Works well to see the elevation of the land while flying.
3,Intriguing,"The Mind Keepers is an intriguing novel. In it, a small town is threatened by deception and crime connected with a rogue corporation under contract to the government. The design is political control through the electronic manipulation of the townspeople. The book illustrates how these forces affect the education and business of this town and people's lives. Although the book is fiction, it could be fact. The characters and the town could be your neighbors and town--ordinary citizens facing a threat to their way of life. The Mind Keepers has all the facets of a good mystery, many twists and turns that keep a reader involved. I'm sure anyone who had read this book would recommend it to others."
3,0205283136,"There is some good books and not so good books. This book is neighter. The intention of author a great innovative but the cases, application and examples are very limited. Additionally, the author always uses the application for explanation. The limited reference is only in educational areas, while I prefer to read a general idea or more in scientific research (see ""A Ph.D. Is Not Enough : A Guide to Survival in Science"" by Feibelman or ""Tomorrow's Professor : Preparing for Academic Careers in Science and Engineering"" by Reis). Therefore, this book is categorized as ""not-so-good-book"" for me. In contrast, my girlfriend in education school quite like this book. This book shows many reference to the referee journals including the statistics, e.g., acceptance rate, turn-over time, # article per year., etc. Therefore, this book is a ""good-book"" for education student, at least my friend. Well, since it's neighter one, I will give this book 3 stars then."
5,Standing Ovation for Jim Cole,"Until I heard this CD, I had never heard of Jim Cole (forgive me). One listen, and I was hooked. Cole is an incredibly gifted singer/songwriter whose performance both vocally and on the guitar left me amazed that he is not a household name.Yes, he sounds a lot like James Taylor (a fact that he even pokes fun at), but don't let this fool you. Cole is not a derivative Taylor clone -- his music is both original and deeply personal, and displays dimensions I have never heard in James Taylor's work.Alternating between solemn songs full of deep truth to light-hearted, humerous numbers, Cole knows just how to keep his audience thoroughly engaged. Just when things are on the brink of getting too serious, he jolts them with a good dose of humor. ""Railroad Bill"", in particular, is one of the most cleverly humerous songs I have ever heard.If you like the sound of singer/songwriters such as James Taylor and Carole King, buy this CD. It will quickly become one of your favorites!"
4,Reality=?,Although the book may get some what dilirious at some points it certanly shoes a more alternative revue to alot of movies that we all thought where out there. You get a feeling that the author is in one way trying to distroy Hollywood but still shoes appraisiasion to Hollywood movies. I would get it to show you an alternative side to movie revues.
4,good complement to Footprint Jordan guide,"Using both in tandem prior to my trip to Jordan helped a lot. Enjoyed getting historical and other insights, thank you!"
1,terrible refills,After a couple of uses the expensive mop refill separated from the holding channel. This happened to all 3 refills we used. Waste of money.
1,Do Not Purchase These Inferior Sponges !!!,"We bought three of these a year ago, and all three of them fell apart after one or two uses, with the sponge portion tearing free of the metal channel when squeezing. The sponges appear to be too large for the mop, or the metal channel is far too weak keep the sponges properly grasped. Buyer beware!!!"
2,some what disappointed!,"This is not a commercial product either. Smaller than the usual commercial sponge, but acceptable being paired with the mop handle it is. I wouled not buy these items again except I now have the handle and in order to use it I will have to buy the same sponges in the future.Rubbermaid Commercial 6436YEL - Mop Head Refill for Steel Roller, Sponge, 12 Wide, Yellow"
5,Kendo Mop Head?,"Could someone please tell me if this mop head is for a mop formerly made by Kendo products? I have used those for years and love them, But I can no longer find Kendo listed. Maybe Rubbermaid bought them? I would appreciate some help with this.Thank you."
3,Not so much...,"As I began taking an interest in Buddhism in my teens, I turned to this book because it seemed available at just about any Borders or Barnes and Noble you'd walk into.At the time, I was pleased, especially because Humphreys would compare Buddha and Jesus in ways that made Buddhism make a lot of sense.Now, if I were ""entering the stream,"" as they say, I would probably avoid this book because it is pretty outdated, speaking to situations which really no longer exist. This is not to say it's a poor book; it's not. But much ink has since been spilled introducing Buddhism to the West, and Humphreys writing just doesn't have the relevance it may once have had. Furthermore, Humphreys real bias is towards a sort of theosophy, something closer to Unitarianism than buddhism. Try something a little newer."
4,Happy Camper,"Dimension Compe PedalI love these pedals, they're sturdy and light, (but then again I only weigh around 135-140 lbs.) Unlike what the other guys said, I don't get slippage at all on these pedals, the pointed parts prevent slippage quite well.They are a bit painful though, be careful you don't accidentally make the pedals come spinning around to hit you in the shins, and dig in a bit."
3,Decent pedals,"The pedals are light, but they don't have a sturdy feel to them. I have used them for about a year now and they do the job. My feet still slip a little with these pedals, but not as much as with my previous pedals."
4,an excellent insight into the points of porcelain.,"I feel that this book helped immensly with my work in porcelain, it helped me to understand its qualities and form better. The book is well written and very helpful, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book."
4,"Comtemporary Christian music in a ""James Taylor"" style!",I was introduced to Jim Cole's music at one of his concerts I attended. The sound and style are like listening to James Taylor sing Christian music. The songs were fresh and new to me (no remakes that I recognize). It's one of my favorite CDs!
5,A welcome and refreshing flashback to simpler times & music,"Yes, the sound is remarkably similar to James Taylor, but even the most die-hard, lifelong JT fan won't resent it. It's distinctly Cole's own sound, a step beyond. Over-40 types will love the blend of simple acoustics and profound lyrics. An absolute must."
5,Fantastic Singer/Songwriter/Guitar Artist w/ a Humble Spirit,"Jim Cole, wow, if you ever have the opportunity to attend one of Jim's concerts, I have one word for you. Attend.This guy will overwhelm you with his musical talents. After listening to only one of Jim's song, you will immediately see how the hand of God has blessed Jim and how his ministry is bringing Glory to God as well as touching your spirit. This man has a sincere and humble heart that can only be the work of the Holy Spirit leading and guiding Jim in all of his musical endeavors. Go, you will be truly Blessed !"
5,Fabulous!,"Jim's vocals are beautiful and he is an accomplished guitarist. However, these attributes are outweighed by his lyrics which truly show his heart for God. These songs will inspire and uplift the listener."
5,Another winner from Guruge & Lindgren,A must read for the entire IT department of companies trying connect their legacy host computer systems to the Internet. The book deals with the issues from multiple perspectives. One or more of the real world case studies are sure to address the challenges in any company. The book also details the infrastructure requirements for successfully implementing an integrated host to WEB network.
2,Don't waste your money on the unipack 12' ocean house,"I ordered the 12"" unipack ocean house for my grandson's birthday. When I opened the package, it was so badly bent out of shape that it wouldn't even stand upright on it's own. When shipped, it was literally bent and jammed into a box that was too small. Since I wanted my grandson to have it on his birthday, I worked and worked with it poking small towels throught the holes trying to get it back to it's original shape. I was finally able to get it to stand up, but it still had dents and creases that were there for good. If this was some cheap toy, I wouldn't complain; but for $22 I expect the seller to take enough time to find a box that fits. The small stuffed animals were cute, but next time I would order from another company."
5,super sweet,This toy is durable. The animals are soft and silky. The details are sonderful. Lovely handle and carry case. The animals fit in the case nice and secure. Pretty colors and sweet character faces. A+ I was pleased and so was my family.
1,just not worth the money,"This product would be 5 stars if it was only 5 or 10 dollars, but it really isn't worth more than that."
5,no bliss,THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME. i bought this specifically for a camping trip and along with a eno doublenest hammock. i will never sleep in a tent again. thats enough sasid.
5,Bug Proof 100%!,"I initially started sleeping an a hammock, indoors, after years of poor sleep due to back problems. Over time, my interest in hammock camping blossomed. Not particularly wanting to spend the 300-500 dollars for a good camping hammock, I bought the Bliss No-See-Um Cocoon, and man, am I ever glad I did. I have slept in mosquito infested swamp land, and this baby kept me sealed up and bite free. Highly recommend!"
2,Hammock Cover,"I purchased this thinking it had the hammock with it. It was sent to my daughter and she was seriously disappointed, as well as we were, that there was not a hammock. The product is great, but needed more details."
3,Keeps the bugs away but doesn't keep out of your face,"By the time I'm writing this review, I've used the net four times. Every time I've woken up bug free, but every time I've constantly woken up in the middle of the night because the net is right on my face.It comes with dinky strings to hold up the top of the net, which have fallen every time I put them up, and it doesn't come with instructions to help the Novice (me)."
2,Not a book to learn from,"This is an odd book. It does not really teach you how to do anything with the Apache software you just downloaded. It just tells you all about the modules, protocols, and so on in a reference type manner. So if you think you're going to learn how to setup a webserver and begin practicing with PHP, XML, HTML and other facets of Web development from this book you would be disappointed. There is nothing practical in here either for an beginner or an expert."
1,adult content,"I sent it to my 7 yr old grandaughter because she loves horses, but her parents stated there was some bad language and love making which they did not want her to hear or see. She is a young christian girl who does not have a TV, and therefore, has not and does not want to be exposed to this sort of thing."
1,bad customer service,"I also thought the belt buckle came with this item. I checked the item description and it is very, very misleading. 14.99 for this belt without the cool big belt buckle. I would have never ordered it! I contacted the seller with my concern and they just said ""sorry, you should have ordered the add on buckle. But it wasn't available anyway."" Buyer beware."
2,Belt without Buckle,"So you see the belt buckle that is prominently displayed in the picture...Yeah that doesn't come with the belt. It says no where in the ad that it doesn't come with the belt buckle, I wouldn't have minded ordering the buckle when I ordered the belt. I found out after the belt arrived from their useless customer service that I would have to pay another 15.00 for priority shipping again for the belt buckle makes it less than worthwhile."
3,duckie belt,well wat can i say!?! it'z a duckie belt! if u like duckz or just like random thingz! thiz iz sumthin' u need! it givez u a few laughz & a few weird lookz but so worth it! so yea! highly recommend!
4,A pretty shweet belt,"This belt is pretty awesome. I'm pretty glad it didn't have to come with the belt buckle though, because sometimes you can have too much ducky cuteness. I'm still waiting to get a date because of it though! I would say the only real downside of this belt is that it's not very big so it might look a little anorexic in some belt loops, if you know what I mean. But yea, it's seriously a pretty rad lil belt."
1,How To Destroy A Premise With A Lot of Promise,"The premise of this book is a good one, however, the author's inability to look past the obvious and superfluous make this book predictable, boring, and even offensive at times. Vincent states the obvious, rarely finding insight into masculinity or what it means to be a man that hasn't already been stated by other people in a much more intelligent way. Instead of breaking stereotypes that women hold about men, it seems to perpetuate them, and all of Vincent's observations seem shallow and simply skim the surface of gender identity.She does not create sympathy for men, and she creates even less for women. I'm not sure where she found the women that she dated, but they seem like some of the most closed-minded, grudge harboring women with so many pent up issues they should be looking for a therapist instead of a date.Any other book on gender in our society would be a more insightful, riveting, and intelligent read. Skip this one."
2,"So, so, so disappointing","While this book had some moments where it contributed something, it read much more like one long rant about how tough it is to be male, and how tough it was for the author to go undercover and attempt to be a male. Her skewered prospective of the absolutely miserable lives of her blue collar teammates (she all but encourages they to smoke and drink themselves into an early grave because they have such hopeless lives anyway) is just one example of her strangely slanted view of the world."
3,There's some insight here but nothing really amazing,"There is some interesting insight here but I never really got the feeling that this person passed off fully as a man. Even the picture on the cover looks like a guy, an effiminate guy. The book details interesting areas where the author put herself thru to dive deepinto the world of men. Sometimes it felt interesting but for the most part I felt as though she was taking creative license with the 'experiments,'This book/case study is ok but not great."
2,tired of novelty nonfiction,"I think this will be the last time I read novelty nonfiction like this for a long while. And by that I mean books like the one where the guy learns how to be a ""player,"" the woman who dates every guy who asks for a year, and this one...the sort of thing that's more a Hollywood high concept than a story that springs organically from the author's life."
1,"amateur man, amateur author","An infuriating book. I developed a dislike for this narcissistic author. She tackles what could have been an incredibly interesting and valuable project without the requisite research. She studies neither acting or the sociology literature on male-to-male relationships before embarking on her journey. Vincent seems to delight in revealing her disguise to her unwitting ""victims,"" and is cruelly critical of these people. More sensitivity on her part would have been welcomed. That said, it makes a great book to discuss."
4,Overall good book...one problem,"I have to say that I find the subject matter quite interesting. I think her observations are fascinating. The only problem I have with the book is that I believe she writes over the heads of most people. I am a fairly intelligent, educated person and I was constantly wishing I had a dictionary handy. That can be kind of annoying when reading for pleasure. Otherwise, I would say it is worth the read."
2,Tepid,"While there was some useful information,this book appeared to be an effort to prove Ms. Vencent's prejudices, rather than the voyge of discovery that it could have been. The author seemed to be searching for the very worst in men, and of course, she found it. The fact that she would join a men's bowling league, when she couldn't bowl was simply amazing. I don't think a man (or most women) would ever consider doing such a thing. In addition to the lack of substance, I feel the book was written in a very unengaging and simplistic style. Overall, it was one of the few books I have bought over the years that I don't believe was worth the money. If you must buy this book, find a used one, or better yet, get it from the library. If I ever see another book written by Ms. Vincent, I will pass."
4,Entertaining if not particularly enlightening,"Vincent goes behind the scenes -- and behind the suit -- to see what life is really like as a member of the opposite sex. Written in an honest, straightforward, down-to-earth if somewhat overly academic manner, this book shows what goes on in the typically male realms of girly bars, bowling alleys, monastery retreats, and men's wilderness retreats. Vincent makes no sweeping statements, doing her best to convey that her experiences are colored by her particular circumstances. An interesting, if not particularly enlightening, read."
2,Too Bold and Self-Determined,"While reading Vincent's experiment, I was often left uncomfortable by her increasingly negative prospective of men. I felt as though the book was just her way to prove to herself that male stereotypes are facts not fiction. She learns nothing from the experience expect for her own self justifications. At moments i recognized powerful situations that could shed very cold light on reality, but Vincent chose the more self-directed root of only appeasing her motives. Not a very thoughtful read."
3,SELF-MADE MAN,"A very interesting,thought provoking book.Norah's journey took me through my own lifeand sexuality with those, who were stugglingwith their identity.It was enlightening to view the other sidesome of which I knew and she validated.Norah's pain was obvious with her self abusivebehavior. I hope she has found contentment andhappiness."
5,Really enjoyed this book,"As a White Heterosexual Male who gets blamed for everything wrong in the world up to and including tooth decay I was really interested in what this book would say about my ""species"". Written by a Lesbian Feminist (redundant, I know), a product of Womens Studies 101, I was surprised to find that she ""gets it"". I found very little to quible with in her interpretation of Men. Although the chapters on the trip to the woods and the monastery don't apply to the average man.I'd also add that she seemed to find one of the seediest strip clubs in the country to hang out in. I know, I've been in them too. But they're not all like that. I would have liked to hear her impression of a Friday night in a more upscale club where the average guy is more likely to go.In any event Vincent is certainly a talented writer. I look forward to reading more of her work no matter the subject."
2,a narrow perspective,"some interesting parts, but it's from a narrow perspective. i'd like to see this study done by a woman who prefers gentlemen."
5,"Honesty, Your Name is Norah Vincent","I learned about this book on the excellent Instapundit blog. My first impression came from the cover. Ms. Vincent is lovely, yet her male persona, Ned, is convincing. The reflections in Self-made Man have the same form: lovely writing and a muscular theme.Ms. Vincent not only describes the world of men, but also her inner struggle trying to be a man. Ms. Vincent enters a man's world as only a writer can --- almost living the inner experience of men --- with profound honesty.I loved this book."
2,Great Idea Falls Short,"Norah Vincent comes up with an interesting approach for a woman to learn about men, but the idea falls way short. She presents herself as a man and hangs with losers on a working class (or perhaps unemployed class) bowling team, strip club patrons, and a group of monks in a monastery. This is as representative as if I put on fake boobs and a wig and hung out with with a ladies roller derby team and a group of nuns. It was more about the gimmick than about any real insight."
2,foul,"I heard the author during a radio interview and I was immediately intrested in reading about her experiences as a man. I was a little to disapointed to find out that she was a lesbian, meaning she already exudes some aspect of masculinity. However, it reads easy and is intersting, from what I have read so far. Unfourtunately I only read 2 chapters. the author uses profanity and low slang to describe certain parts of the human anatomy, which I found to be a turn off. Though it was intersting,the low brow talk takes it's toal.knowing what I know now, I wouldn't purchase it again."
3,"with all the drawbacks of being a man, why be one?","Men have it bad, women can get away with anything if they know how to cry at the drop of a hat. Men have to be strong and be able to take things and handle things on their own, while woman can fall on her friends and wait for a white knight to come by. I may buy this book. I'm curious how a man survives being a man in this ear of male-hating feminist who attack boys as young as six years old... I use to be a feminist until I've seen them attacking boys as young as my sons. Now I'm ready to show them what a heterosexual woman can do."
3,I agree...this book should be done by a woman who prefers gentleman,"I liked this book for the fact that it was totally innovative. However, I am disappointed in the fact that the experiment seems skewed by the fact that she is indeed someone who prefers the gals. This makes her a bit more inclined to be a more sympathetic ear to the males.However, I do agree with some of her positions on men. I know that men tend to hide emotions which result from the emotional struggle they have with their other male counterparts.The experiments in the different scenarios (dating with women, strip clubs, monastery, men's retreat) are quite intricate and a neat exploration into the male mind.All in all, worth a read!Enjoy!"
1,Norah Vincent seems to really hate women AND men.,"Ms. Vincent seems to sincerely dislike women. In her various guises, Ms. Vincent attempts to relate to, to date and to seduce various women. She tends to identify the resistance she meets from women as game playing, never seeming to consider the possibility that some women simply might not be interested in her. She writes about being offended that a group of women talking animatedly amongst themselves seemed uninterested in getting to know her when she approached out of the blue at a bar. It is almost as though she cannot imagine that women might not be available for conquest, that a group of women might not consider themselves to be ""alone"". At one point, in response to a perceived slight by a woman she muses that she can understand the desire to rape. Men should resist Ms. Vincent's `expose' about the experience of manhood."
2,Frustrating,"This book was written for heterosexual white women with little familiarity with the current state of the feminist movement. I'll save you the expense and effort: the central message of this book is that men and women are very different, people treat men and women differently, and men suffer because of gender roles. If you were already aware of those things, this book will bore you."
5,Thought provoking and enlightening exploration of both genders.,"I could not put this book down. Norah as Ned explored the gendered lives of men and women while playing the role of a young male. Norah Vincent was also able to throw her commentary in from the perspective of lesbian female as well. She offers an enlightened commentary that very few individuals will be in the position to give. Even without considering the offered introspection, the lives and stories of Ned and those he meets are worth exploring by themselves."
3,Great Read Because it's Such a Weird Adventure,"I enjoyed this book as an adventure, wondering the whole time--will they buy it? Will she get away with it? And generally she does, though many think Nora's male double ""Ned"" is effiminate or gay.But this is not just some silly prank. The author gives the process a lot of thought, and she offers interesting reflections on the unique challenges of manhood. In spite of her own story as a lesbian who studied feminism in college, Ms. Vincent approaches manhood with an open and sympathetic mind.I found her insights as unique as her experiences."
4,Self-made Man,"This is a one-of-a-kind book, in that not many people would be able to do what the author did: live in disguise as a man for a year, and also write about it. Very easy to read. Very interesting for a woman to read: the differences in socializing behavior and the toll that that can take are well described. I recommend this for any woman trying to understand men...at work, at home, in a group. I did actually recommend it to a gay fellow who is very sensitive, since I think that he feels the differences in emotional expression (or lack of)in a way similar to many women. I think the book really helped me understand men better, generally speaking. Kudos to the author, who has real courage!"
3,"Not a page-turner in my opinion, like I was told...","I absolutely love books on the human experience in many different forms, but this one was extensively dry, filled with too much of her own thoughts and feelings and not enough about the experiences she was having. Plus, her vocabulary is outstanding, but to the average person they would not be able to understand the information she is trying to relay. I will admit I got about 50 or so pages into it and stopped, mainly because I was bored, so I have not read the whole book. Maybe I will try to get a little further in it to see if it picks up...I just know that I kept falling asleep trying to read it."
3,entertaining but the conclusions are suspect,"I enjoyed the book, except when the philosophy major came out. Her conclusions about the secret life of men are silly from the point of view of a lifelong male. However, the story if fun to read.The part about her mental breakdown being caused by her role as a male is suspect. Norah's life as a lesbian might have left her slightly clueless about men. Her surprise that men have feelings or her assertion that men only have a 3 note emotional range is funny. Her assumptions that men stare at women out of hostility is an interesting assumption. Most men I know look at women for a different reason than hostility."
2,Double agent,"I took this book out at the library in hopes of liking it enough to buy it. I thought it would be a good read, but after reading about half of the book, the story kind of drops and was very boring. I was expecting more humour, dialoge, and a position from the author when really it was written like a story. She wrote about the typical situations that I would expect but I just couldn't find them interesting. Disappointing."
2,just not very tasty,"We bought a box of the coffee, and a box of the peanut butter barts- hoping to find a new wonderful quck bite bars to grab on the go.We were all disapointed in the taste, they were dry, and generally had very little flavor to them. The one positivie aspect is that they were good sized as far as filling one up.I would not reccoment these bars- there are too many wonderful flavored ones in the grocery store to settle for so-so taste."
3,OK but not as good as the Dark,"I like the Dark Chocolate bars so much, I tried these but only once.Have thought for a long time someone should offer a great tasting coffee flavored protein bar.Still waiting."
5,"For me, best of NuGo","I've tried quite a few no-or-low sugar protein bars, and I find NuGo generally among the best. I had decided Black Cherry was my favorite until I tried Coffee Break. Yum."
1,Disappointing quality,"The wand was great when it worked. Unfortunately, that only lasted about half a year. Another cracked plastic nozzle. It is no longer able to pressurize the water that it sprays, making it perform even worse than a conventional garden hose spray nozzle."
2,Poor Design,"* Front flap has magnetic closure only, no clasp* My 17"" laptop will fit in the bag, but the inner velcro strap would not stretch over it* Carrying handle is not centered on top of bag (though the shoulder strap is fine)"
4,Get this for the library,"This is an awesome book. I've read this before I read some of the nolo books. After reading this book I had a talk with a intellectual property lawyer and he was very impressed. However since I'm concerned with electronics and technology its a bit more difficult. Finding resources on these subjects is very scarce, prepare to pony up for lawyer."
4,majority rule?,"Since when is truth determined by adhering to majority opinion? Those that constitute the most powerful block can filter history and erase memories of those who are not acceptable. Several of the reviews mention the Trinity and Arianism as the ""main"" heresy. Review the histories of Harnack, Rowan Williams, and RPC Hanson. The 4th century historical context was not so black and white or good and evil. What of the Protestant Reformation, or the history of the Jewish people at the hands of Catholicism, the oldest ""orthodoxy"" (next to the eastern Orthodox). Does a judgment of hersy lead to persecution? Historically it has and it would again if enough people in our modern society hadn't become unbelievers due to dictated doctrine and practice by the powers that be among the large churches. People like Shelby Spong certainly react to that same rigidity. Think for yourself, our God is not to small to reach towards all that truely seek him."
4,a supplemental resource,"This set of 2 books has an enormous amount of photographs. In fact, what is meant by an Illustrated Encyclopedia is that it is composed solely of photographs. There is no text other than the captions. Photograph quality is generally good, although some are of juvenille specimens and don't show mature form. It is also clear that culture plays a large part in the mature form in many cases, and it would be nice to show various specimens rather than just one. Still, this is an essential resource to have in your library if you want to know about garden conifers. You'll just need additional resources as well."
5,a wonderful history,"Folpe spent years going through archives and talking to locals to unearth a detailed history of Washington Square. Her research paid off. This is technically an academic book, but the prose is so engaging and lively that anyone who has even a remote interest in Washington Square will enjoy this."
1,Focus on looks is an adult problem!,"I am surprised to read about the content of this book.How many adopted pre-school children think about their family situation from questions of looks?? Luckily, they mostly don't at all - their existencial thinking is deeper and more intelligente.None of my friends' adopted children from Asia, Africa and Latin America, all living in Scandinavia, even reflects that they have a different skin colour than their parents. When their first thoughts on looks come, they identify with their adoptive parents so much that they are sure they look alike.One of my friend's Korean daughter's first comment on looks was that the kids at daycare ""asked if I was from China! How ridicolous - Chinese are slant-eyed!""Young kids' thoughts about their origin is much more often about their parents than their skin colour - why they weren't laying in their adoptive mothers' bellys. I think that is a much better theme to explore with them, than to focus on the looks."
3,Nice Introduction,"Anyone who wants to know how shotguns work, particularly fine double guns, will benefit from reading this book. Personally, I may be judging this book a little harshly since I am technically oriented, and found that some of the topics of discussion could've gone much deeper - at least for me. With that, my review rating is based on the fact that I wanted very detailed descriptions and step-by-step illustrations or photographs that cover every stage and movement of cocking, locking, firing, selective ejection, inertia-block single-selective-triggers. The book covers all of these just fine, but for the technical geek, it might not meet all of your demands."
3,Average,"Was a bit disappointed to the end, thought Cordelia would have put up more of a fight when confronted, that she would have her henchman try to finish the job while she was under house arrest. He just disappeared, and she went to easily."
5,Loved it,I liked both characters and I thought the writing was well done. Nobody was overly typecast which is easy to find in this genre. Will definitely read more by this author!
1,Couldn't finish it,"I finally put this book down. I just can't finish it. I can't get past her age. 17 seems awfully young. Maybe she is older later in the book, but I didn't read enough to see if that is the case. I know in that time, girls married younger, but I just kept thinking, ""She's just a kid!"". And Connor's habit of calling her wee Becca over and over just annoyed me to no end. It made him sound like some middle-aged pervert. It kind of gave me the creeps. I didn't find it endearing or sweet, simply grating and goofy. I really wanted to like this book. The duke disguised as a groom appealed to me, but I think Johanna Lindsey's Man of my Dreams was a far superior and immensely more enjoyable book."
4,Good book,This book was very funny. I started reading over at my friends house and laughed out load so much that she now wants to read the book. Some parts of the book are slow but it is not too bad. You just get the feeling that it is going somewhere but you just want it to get there a little quicker. For her first book it is very good! I can not wait until her next book comes out in April of 2005!
3,Nothing to rave about,"I don't know what everyone seems to be raving about. I bought this based on the many 5-star reviews and was disappointed to find the story unbelievable (and kind of silly), the hero (Connor) sadly un-heroic (a total shirker, who is trapped into assuming his duties), and the heroine (Rebecca) all too willing to believe that the hero does not really care for her (a common failing among romance heroines that irritates me to no end; I know the author needs to create conflict, but that's such a lame--and overused--one).I'd say this is an ok first book, but certainly not a 5-star book. 5-stars is for books that capture my imagination and demand to be read. This book did not do this. So go ahead and buy it, but don't expect it to be as great as all these 5s indicate."
1,Ummm .... Ewww,"I finally gave in to all the recommendations in my book club and read this book. I however, do not share the same glowing opinion I was almost not able to finish; but I read it all to give my book club the benefit of the doubt. The writing was okay but there was an ICK factor: the relationship between the heroine and the hero seemed like pedophilia since the hero stays with the heroine's family to be near her when she was just 12 and he's mid 20's EWWW. Another creepy thing is that he calls her ""wee Becca"" Double EWWW."
4,"This debut book is okay, but Long gets much, much better","This book is good, but if you've read any of Long's later works you'll be disappointed. She's obviously still finding her writing-legs here. The characters don't have the depth or believability of her subsequent efforts; Connor's calling Rebecca ""wee Becca"" *every* *single* *time* he addresses her is incredibly annoying; and Becca's youth and innocence just aren't very interesting.All that said, however, this is still far far far better than most Regency romances and Julie Anne Long is a fantastic author. :)"
4,Couldn't stop reading!,"A delightful book - I became involved with the characters from the first page. Both hero and heroine are unusual, intelligent, and compassionate people, who seemed quite believable in their actions and motivations. I had no trouble believing that the hero would choose to leave his constricted life of a duke's heir behind him; he wanted the challenge of creating his own life and his own fortunes. I saw no ""ick"" factor at all in his interest in the 12-yr-old girl, as our heroine is in the first chapter. He expressed NO sexual interest in her then; rather he recognized how unusual her character was as compared to the usual empty-headed daughters of the ton. Only when she became of marriageable age, and was in fact about to be FORCED into an unwanted marriage with a debt-ridden lout, that our hero developed a romantic interest in her.A very enjoyable book."
3,Not that bad....,"But it took me over a week to get through it. Not a keeper for me, but worth reading. A pretty, good, first book for this Author....Seems so many reviewers here, gave this book a lot of stars, but it was a yawner for me. Just didn't have that zap, to keep me going.My house is clean, Im gaining weight, which means, I better find a good book fast, or my buttons will pop. I rate my stars by how hungry I am, and Im stuffed... =) Meaning, I put the book down way too much.Story line was good, and I loved the Duke, but Rebecca the heroine, was as dull as she could be (might be the age 17/18). Edelston was funny, I really liked him.Worth reading, but not keeping. But, I will be on the look out for more by this Author, she has potential."
3,Almost there,"I started this book after I had read To Love a Thief by the same author. I was impressed with her wit and her character which are, in general, full of depth and humor.This first book is an impressive effort. The story is different (not the done to death forced marriage etc) and the characters definitely have flare.Although I did enjoy the stories and the character the conversations were rather stilted and I nearly couldn't stand the ending. Though that could be considered a matter of taste rather than technique or writing style.Overall I enjoyed the book, it's ok, I won't read it again but whenever Ms. Long writes another I will be third or fourth in line to take a look =)."
2,Wee Becca over and over and over again...,"I could tell this was her first book. Her other books were far better written than this. This was bad. We have a ""hero"" whose hiding from his life after Waterloo and pretending to be an Irish groom. I bet his false Irish accent was horrible and I'm wondering why no one figured him out. He wasn't clever, he wasn't charming and he said ""Wee Becca"" a hundred times. I couldn't find any reason to sympathize with his former life. And why was it ok for Rebecca to spend so much time with a groom?? The age difference didn't bother me so much as Rebecca being immature and very naive. She's first painted as unique, well-read, adventurous and then she acts alot like a child. It was just too easy for Connor/Roark to convince Rebecca to run away and leave all that she has known behind. The characters were just off and the story unbelievable."
3,Started out great...,"Started out great but fizzled into predictability somewhere around page 100. All the classic elements are there, all the classic intrigues, and all the classic mistakes being made by a hero who doesn't seem like the type of person to make them. I had great hopes for this story but it looks like the author gave up half way through and relied on convention to finish it for her.Better luck next time."
1,absoluting nothing to recommend about this book...,"Didn't get into this book at all. Had no zip and no spice to it. Writing is just ok, nothing outstanding. Plot was so-so. Just didn't grab me and pull me in. Glad I got it through the library and didn't waste my money."
5,Charming!,"I have to say I am sooo impressed with my first encounter with Julie Anne Long as a writer. This book is special. It had caught my attention on the bookshelf a few times, but I have a ""to-be-read"" pile a mile high, so I resisted. Then, after seeing all the reviews here I just knew I had to pick it up. I read it in one morning because I simply had to keep going. I loved the characters and felt I really got to know them. They are truely dynamic and just - special. I am glad I bought it because it certainly has re-read potential (for those of us who re-read). Way to go Julie!! I will be pick up your next books without hesitation from now on!"
1,DID NOT FLY,"GOT TO THE F.B.I, WARNING- THEN TO THE RATING PG 13-THE NOTHING!!! IM IN THE PROCESS OF SENDING BACK 4 CREDIT"
1,Faulty Conclusions; Terrible Prose,"Friedman badly needed an editor. Even with one, he sets up so many false dichotomies that this book is beyond flawed. Despite its popularity, which these days unfortunately means very little, I don't recommend it. I plowed through it and was shocked at how poorly the man writes. Don't make the same mistake I did and avoid falling for any hype about Jew Vs. Jew. His false take on American Jewry seems made not out of sincerity but for the sake of making his un-grounded case. I found this text both a waste of money and a waste of time. I'll only add that Friedman's arrogance and above-it-all attitude are not attractive. In a better writer, I might have given this 2 or 3 stars, but Friedman's prose is unbelievably pedestrian."
2,Mediocre Bestseller!,"Without his fame and the media hoopla surrounding this book, it would be seen for what it is: a tour of the divisions among USA Jews at this time, 2000. It is not written by a man with an ear for the art of writing interesting sentences. It is dazzling... not the book, but the fact that far lesser known books can change your life, while this book, like so many bestsellers, is just a prosaic lump of words from on high. I found this tour of Jewish American divisions full of atonal prose. The structure, also, is awkward and the omnicient voice, so male, so passe. I could be wrong about the merits of the book, but unfortunately I'd rather be laid out under a scorching sun for a week than have to bear re-reading this tome. And that's why I give Professor Freedman, who is not short on arrogance, a reluctant 2 stars. Reluctant? Because if everyone else is raving about it, perhaps I am wrong. But then, on reflection, I seriously doubt that."
5,Intrareligious Battle,"One must either love Mr. Freedman's book or hate it. For me it was a most informative,well written summary of the way so many thing are happening in the Jewish community. It is books like this that may help break some of the barriers of communication between the different sects of Judiasm. As a practicing Temple going reform Jew, I find the thoughts and the views of the Orthodox enlightening. I try to educate myself in Torah from my Rabbi and from Orthodox Rabbis. They both quote the same scriptures. Perhaps Mr. Freedman's book will enlighten a few of the extremests on either end."
2,"""Aren't We Interesting"" is the Subtext..","I'm Jewish and yes we are interesting--our history, our schisms, our mishigas. But unfortunately, Mr. Freedman is Not an interesting writer, nor did he pick a subject that was truly organic as an interest for him--taking here an educated guess. You can feel the fillers in his work. I've read that he's a generous professor. I believe it. But he needs a better editor next book and a subject that Really Grabs him next time. It's not enough to want to write a book. A book has to want to be written through you..."
1,"A Hack novel, 70% filler. nothing more","This book is about tells you about one type of Jew-EUROPEAN! All Jews mentioned here are of GERMAN/RUSSIAN/ROMANIAN/LITHUANIAN/POLISH origin. What about all the other big Jewish group in the US, the SEPHARDIC community (Yemen, Uzbekestan, Iran, Syria, Turkey and Ethiopia). Not all Jews eat corned beef and wear beards. Some look just like the Arabs.The truth is, religion in America is changing. The Catholic church is no longer immune to allegations of child abuse, women are being ordained as priests in England, and in Synagogues women are demanding a bigger role than before. This book is good only for insomniacs and people on long distance Greyhound trips."
2,"Bad Writing, Above Average Reporting",Please delete the existing review. I did not write it. There has been some mix-up. The original reviewer says that he was from connecticut. I am uncertain how this mix-up could have occurred.
2,never received book,I never received this book.It was for a book club and I was not prepared for my bookclub either.I would like a refund.
5,The Shaman's Bulldog,"Dear Readers,I must say that this is one of the most outstanding books that I have read in a long time. In a most complicated world that we all live in today it was so nice to read about the simple things that make us what we really are.Thankyou Renaldo and thankyou Mr Faccio Bello for showing us the way to your heart."
5,Made in USA,"This was a Christmas gift for my 8 yr old son, and he loves it. We've had many catches with it and it's the real deal, not toy. Made in USA, as a football should be (C'mon, we're the only country that plays the game! No offense, Canada). Note that it's real leather, so it will take a beating if used on pavement."
4,Age of Kings review: Mission Joan of Arc,"The movie was so exciting and after i saw it, i imaginate the live in the Age of Kings. There is a computer game (Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings) that i think is the most article and piece of history to relation the movie. The movie taught to me that everything we want to be and to do, we should do with very strenght and dedication. I haven't listen to much the soundtrack, but the part i had listen is wonderful and extraordinary. I recommend to everybody this cd"
1,The messenger: The story of Joan of Arc,"This CD sucks BIG TIME! Goodness, what the hell is this supposed to be! I mean is it music or sounds trying to convey feeling? Don't buy this sound effect feeling CD."
1,This CD is a piece of trash,"If you like modern classical music this is a fair piece. If,you are like me and appreciate real music, it is most dissonant and aggravating. Definitely, a downer.It is basically a good test for high quality speakers and that is all."
2,Waste of money,I bought this book for a friend who has trouble reading and now I can't even sell the used book on EBAY. I thumbed through the book. A very typical storyline with a typical ending written by a typical third rate writer.
5,Best CD I bought in 2002,"I'm known for having interesting, good music and collect music from all around the world. I also love lounge and Brazilian music. I played this at a recent holiday cocktail party and it was a big hit. This CD is amazing. Excellent. Incredible. Nuff said."
3,Probably the lowest rate,"I am not agree with the most people that makes review of this CD. Infact my real rate it's between the 2 and 3, probably the lowest!I am sorry but i cannnot understand why in this work there are 3 songs like the last 2 (Balanco and Cordara Orchestra) and like the third one (Hi Fi trumpet).It's a pity because the rest it's quite a good job. In any case the project (a jet society around the world) was probably too ambicius. The resault it's more a travel in the night clubs where you can find old rich men with young nice girls. This is the atmosphera that i feel on this Cd. In any case there are something good ( for exemple the first song Lisboa a note) and with good mix (in particular between 5 to 9 tracks).At the end i suggest not to buy it.....but if you buy more than 100 cd in a year...well you can also buy it!"
2,An unbearably religious examination of guilt,"I've been looking for a book with this title for a long time, it seems. But I was disappointed to find that the book deals with guilt in a way that focuses too much on religious causes and cures than is comfortable for me. This might be a good book for someone more spiritual than me, but for the more secular, the book isn't usable"
4,A hilarious version of life...,This video is told in Jerry Clower fashion. I think all of us can relate to the classic tales of his life. We've all had family experiences that were less than desirable...use humor to get through. This is a great video!! Hilarious...
4,Consider it part of a broad business education,"When one considers the amount of time/money they spend on improving their job skills, it would seem obvious that a high-value read like 'Say it with Charts' would be worth some consideration. It provides a framework for using charts to your advantage- and not just within oral presentations. If anything, this book will increase your willingness to use charts to your advantage when selling an opinion. It forces the user to think about exactly what it is they are trying to say - and then produce a professional looking chart to relay that message.Any edition will do - the content will not change with the times. The underlying principles can be quite powerful and can be the difference between a simple presentation and one which elicites praise."
2,Overpriced,"Highly overpriced. The author or publisher appear to be trying to create demand by the high initial price and then by being more restrictive than most others on the number of devices that you may have registered prior to uploading this book. Further, you can learn just as much by examining the excellent job being done with charts and diagrams by a number of magazines."
3,Interesting but incomplete and clumpsy editing,"The first 2 sections of the book provides a good procedure for making a clear communication : determine your message, identify the type of comparison and then select a suitable chart type.The thidd section entitled ""Say it with concepts and metaphors"" consists of around 60 pages with graphical symbols and pictures. There is little to none explanation given so I tend to consider these pages as plain and simple book page filling.The last section looks like an recent update added to the existing material. This becomes obvious when knowing only this section contains colored pages. The bulk of the book are pages without color. For a book on presentation techniques this is a serious mistake.In conclusion reading this book will give you a feeling of ""interesting stuff"" on one side but also a feeling of incompleteness and clumpsy finishing. A rework by adding colors and some explanation about when and how to concepts and metaphors is more than welcome."
4,Extremely actionable!,"The book has a very useful approach to improving your graphic communications! I have a master's degree in management from Carnegie Mellon, yet I found several useful tips in the first week of reading that helped take my weekly reporting to the next level!"
4,Mike & Co are Great,"I saw Arthur in the Rock Mecca of the NW (you know, Auburn) - And they were great! The CD has some hot sounds. A little sappy in spots and juicy in others."
5,The Emo side of MxPx,"This is more of an emo CD than a punk CD, but it is a masterpiece. After their first great side poject (The Cootees) I knew I had to hear this, and guess what, I loved it. The only problem is that it is WAY too short. They need to release a full length album soon, because I see much talent in this group. The group called Arthur. If you have the means, or just wanna listen to good music then buy this NOW!!!"
5,oldies radio,"A must have for anyone growing up in the detroit area. great 50,s radio show with commercials. good memories"
3,Radio show,"The music is there, but you need to wade through a 'beloved' radio show to get to the tunes. Not what was expected but overall OK."
2,"Poor construction, doesn't last long",The shoe tore from the sole after about a year. The leather is also very thin and does not hold its shape well.
1,Awful,The movie was horrible. The captioning was distracting. I am a vegan and knew most of the information from other sources. I was expecting it to be another Forks Over Knives. And much if the information was the same. But it went off the rails with wild claims. A vegan diet can help many things like heart disease and diabetics But I don't believe it will cure HIV. That's just irresponsible.
4,Good stuff,"Very nice product: smells nice, decent hold, long lasting, and washes out easily. I have thick thick asian hair and it does a good job of adding texture and giving shape without much shine but if you're looking to spike your hair i'd recommend something a little stronger like the Bed Head Stick. This product is only a 3 according to Osis's scale so just keep that in mind."
4,Good bedside book,I have been reading the selections from this book every day for over a year. It is a great way to get a glimpse into a great mind. Well worth having even if you just look into it occasionally!
5,A priceless book that everyone should have,"Of all the books I've owned, this is becoming my most loved. It's meant to be used on a daily basis (one page per day, with several related ideas), over & over again, year after year. Tolstoy gathered quotes & insights from a wide range of wise people, including himself. If you take the time to really think about each day's ideas, you'll be enriching your life till the day you die. I leave it open (with a rubber band) to make it easier to catch each day's wisdom. It's a simple book, but in no way shallow or cutesy. Buy a copy for everyone you love that you think will use it."
5,Wisdom from Tolstoy,"A fantastic book! It's written in a 365 day format so you can pick it up on any day and start there. Some of his wisdoms need to be taken one day at a time other times I found myself reading days or weeks ahead they were so interesting.His wisdom is timeless, obviously Tolstoy was a man ahead of his time. He has a quote for everyday from some famous text or other sometimes biblical, but not always.I really enjoyed it."
4,"Good book but NOT the ""last"" book written by Tolstoy","Calendar of Wisdom, a compilation of various wise sayings, is not the last book written by Tolstoy as claimed by one reader --Path of Life is. Calendar of Wisdom is a collection of wise sayings that caught Tolstoy's fancy. By the time he was 82 Tolstoy had re-thought the sayings in Calendar of Wisdom from a different point of view. In Path of Life he organized old and new wise sayings, from his own writing and from other philosophers, into an ordered, coherent philosophy of life --hence the title."
1,BLANK DISC IN PACKAGE!!,"Package arrived on time, however, there is NO music on disc!! When I went to play it this morning, the disc is blank.Dissappointing as this was for Christmas gathering."
4,"Excellent intro to Data Structures, but helps to have a good prof!","A good, clearly written book, although there are a few mistakes in the code given. Still, it covers some tough topics in a clear and concise way. Still, it's not a book I wouldn't tackle without some guidance from a class!"
2,school Book,i paid for an expedite mail service and never arrived on time. this caused me to drop my class since i didn't have a book to read.
1,Disappointed,I loved the first Touched by the Angel CD. I felt the Christmas CD was mediocre at best.
5,A Wonderful CD,"I think that this is a great CD for any Touched veiwer and for anyone. Although the album is not all Christmas songs, every song is great. I love the song If I Can Dream by Miss Resse, who also plays Tess on the show. If you are a Touched veiwer, it is a 'must-have'! It includes the song from the season premier, Such a Time as This. The song is titled such as well, and is by artist Wayne Watson. The other people on the album do a great job too. I really like it and I know that any Touched fan, or anyone in particular would really enjoy this. Have a great Holiday season."
5,Wow! Is the best word I can think of....,"From Della Reese to Wayne Watson this album warms and inspires! One Silent Night by Jaci Velasquez is simply awesome! We won't even talk about how touching it is to hear ""Monica"" (Roma Downey)read The Irish Blessing. A must have for anyone who praises God!"
4,A BIG STORY FOR SMALL READERS,"Most of us remember a favorite childhood game, Giant Steps. As we used to play it one person was It"" while the others took steps, often asking ""May I?"" Surely, there are countless variations, perhaps relating to region or culture.Nonetheless, forget everything you ever knew about the game and prepare yourself for an introduction to a rollicking new version as played by giants, real giants. There are five of these big fellows and they are very bored. There they sit atop a mountain wondering what to do. To pass the time they decide to play Giants Steps - their way.After doing ""one potata, two potata, three potata, four"" to determine who will be ""It."" The fifth giant, who is usually unlucky winds up being ""It."" He sits there counting while the other four take off to the far corners of the globe.How and if he finds them makes a fun story for young readers."

1,Just another piece of ............,Just another piece of junk by an author who puts out anything to make a buck. This book tells you nothing if you ever read anything about options. My eigth grader could of wrote this book if he was not dead.
3,did not actually cook a recipe yet,"I did not actually cook any recipes from this book yet, but looking at it I was disappointed with some of the dishes. They were more fancier then I expected. I wanted some really down home puerto rican recipes like pastellilos."
5,"Comida boricua, hispana y espa√±ola de primera",Daisy is an excellent culinary representative for her Puerto Rican heritage. Her expertise and travels have allowed her to combine her talents and present the most popular recipes of Latin America and Spain.Magn√≠fico Daisy ... keep those recipes coming!una borinque√±a americana y espa√±ola
5,Daisy Rocks !,"I first learned of Daisy thru her cooking show on Create (wgbh). I loved the show, her personality, and all of the dishes she made looked delicious. My sister loves Spanish food and she also watches Daisy's cooking show, so I decided to purchase this book for her as a gift. I was hoping the cookbook would be as great as Daisy's show, and it is! All of the recipes are easy to follow and made with fresh simple ingredients, most of which can be found in a regular grocery store. And Daisy makes suggestions for substitutions for some ingredients which may be harder to find. Daisy covers everything -- sofrito, beef, pork, fish, rice and beans, and even desserts, such as flan! The book has plenty of color photos and also Daisy's wonderful stories of her family sprinkled throughout the text. I loved the book so much that I now want to purchase another copy for myself! If you love simple recipes made with fresh ingredients and big bold flavors, buy this book!"
5,beautifuly done,"daisy cooks book is the best book, I that Ihave very helpful to me, and now I can cook good puterican style for my husband reynaldo. Which he enjoys eating. everyone should buy this book.THANK YOU so much.MRS. Sylvia Nazarrio"
4,Too much salt! But still awesome,"I love this book. I made the yellow rice, the stuffed pork loin (so so good), and the shrimp, scallop & clam saute dish (also great & quick too). The only complaint is that she uses way way too much salt. First time I made the meat rub it was gross because of all the salt. Need to cut back by at least 50 - 75% on the salt."
5,Just as Awesome in Person,I had the pleasure of meeting Daisy at the Oxford Valley Mall in PA. Her personality was just as impressive in person as she is on TV. I took my mom to meet her and she even took a picture with her and she signed our books. The recipes are awesome and she does a great job of telling you how to put the ingredients together....
3,"love her, but...",I love her cooking! But...the cookbook lacked enough photos for my liking and had obscure ingredients I couldn't find at our local grocery store.
5,www.valderbeebeshow.com,"Daisy Martinez is the new food darling of Public Television with her show, Daisy Cooks!. Now her cookbook is helping everyday cooks prepare Latin dishes Daisy Martinez style."
4,Good Book But it Gets Old,Good recipes and well written book. Lost points for the lack of pictures and because it uses the same basic ingredients for just about all the recipes. It gets old. But there were enough worthwhile recipes in the book to justify the price.
3,Was expecting more color plates,"I've owned Jane's books in the past, and though I wasn't expecting too much eye candy, this came in a bit dry."
4,A good visual of the history art of Korean weapondy,"This is fairly well done display of interpretations of the weapons and open hand forms of the historic Korean Military manual- Muye Dobo Tongi. It is interesting that each form is usually demonstrated by different masters, and there are sometimes very different interpretations of the forms. What makes this video special is that it brings to life the difference in style between Korean and Japanese sword forms (and thereby sword philosophies). The original military manual was developed to help the Korean military preserve and study military arts. That included not only their own, but that of potential enemies (Japan and China), so it is interesting to see those differences."
3,"An ""Okay"" knife","This knife is kind of boring. I like my knives to have a little pizzazz, a little bit of flair. This knife doesn't have that. The size is good though. I like a big folder... the feel in my hand. This knife has that good feel. The knife's edge is good and sharp. One-hand opening is difficult since the spring mechanism is very stiff. The blade as a little bit of ""play"" in the handle. I don't like that at all."
5,Psychology of Motivation,"I am very much involved in personal development. This tape series makes it very clear to understand why so many people lose interest in their goals. That we need intrinsic values as a motivator. Since a very young age I am a high achiever, with many personal victories. But I had difficulties to understand what kept me going, even when the odds had been against me. If you want to know why you are feeling an ""internal"" drive to keep going, even against the odds, or if you have difficulties getting motivated at all, these tapes help you understand - and perhaps change. I highly recommend these tapes from Denis Waitley."
5,New Generation of Metal,"These guys out class every metal band back here. american music has gone down the toliet as far as im concerned. does anyone remember the days when our guys were this good? if you've never listen to them, get a cd or two. you'll be converted. METAL!!!"
2,Tangled web,"I enjoyed the author's work so long as he focused on the irrefutable fact that haddith is forbidden by the Qur'an, and is completely un-Islamic. (Not to mention downright weird.)The 19 issue is intellectually interesting, but his need to convince people of the veracity of the Qur'an seems not much different than the haddithian's insistence that they need to explain, add to, refute, and improve upon what Allah had to say.If we never solve the mystery of the Qur'anic reference to the number 19, it should be no loss to those who seek spiritual guidance. After all, religion is based on the miracle of faith. It seems likely that those seeking proof are actually seeking some form of superiority rather than spirituality -- a quest that so often leads to self-aaggrandizement, to which the author seems to have fallen victim in the final analysis."
3,OK,"A well made, easy to use pickup. Not the type of pickup you want to use if you are trying to capture the nuance in a great acoustic guitar; it is more of an electric guitar sound. Very noisy in this single coil version; better to spend a little more and get the humbucking version. A very good pup if you're playing acoustic rhythm parts behind and electrified band but not the pup I'd choose for a solo acoustic gig"
2,Fishman Pro-Neo-D01 Magnetic Soundhole Pickup,"I was excited when I read the reviews on this product, but once I received it, I was not impressed.....I found that it took some twisting and turning to install it on my guitar, and the ni found that the pick up is supper sensitive and it picks up everything around it, including some humming......Not Impressed"
4,Useful only for small items.,"I bought this case a year or so ago. It works as advertised. I will sometimes store extra memory cards or cash in there. As for the shiny edge that one reviewer mentioned, just do what I did to mine.... use a black permanent marker to darken/black out the metal edge. Once done the stashcard blends in seamlessly with the rest of the laptop body/case. ;)"
4,Stash Card,"While the stash card was everything that it said it was in the ad, I was a little disappointed in two things in particular. One was that the metal cover that is attached was sharp enough to cut me within 5 minutes of use.. The other was that the cover of the compartment, while sturdy, is shiny metal. This is visible from the outside of the computer, which completely defeats the purpose of discretion. I would have rather had it black to match most laptop's dust covers. Otherwise it will prove very useful, the price was right, and It is big enough for two memory cards and lunch money."
5,Best scent,I love this product and have been using it for years. During this time the price has slowly crept up. I still splurge when it works in my budget or I ask for it as a gift. Expensive but worth the cost.
3,"Nice for enthusiasts, not so hot for modelers","The book is okay. It should have been run by the editing department another time or two though as there are a lot of gramatical errors and typos and such.The story of the Gripen is told fairly well however, with lots of development details and obscure but interesting facts. The text can be somewhat disjointed though and could have been better organized. Even with that there is lots of great info in this book.For modelers: you're out of luck. Almost 0 detail shots. There is a good section on cockpit development but only a few photos and you can find better ones on the net. Most of the pictures in the book are very nice but are just generic, here's-the-Gripen shots. A few photos are terribly pixilated as well.Anyway if you want info on the Gripen, go for it. If you want a modeling reference, well, there isn't really one yet."
2,Huge disappointment,"Ok, this is written from a modelers standpoint.The big problem is 90% of the pics are flight pics. very few on the ground so as far as getting detail walk around shots for modeling? FORGET it! no useful pics of the landing gear, no line drawings of the cockpit beyong the front panel, no shots of the wheels, no close ups of panel and rivit detail, no usable closeups of engine nozzles. 6 pics I had immediately recognized and had downloaded from the internet, there 2 poorly done pics of pilot/with suit. and the helmets were only lightly addressed. If you want page after page after page of pretty plane in flight shots, then you will like this book. it does do a good textural historical overview of development of the type though.I bought the book brand new and subsequently saw it available used for 6 dollars. BUMMER! in fact, i have other aerofax titles, and they are VERY useful, dont know what happened with this particular book."
1,Quality of binding is horrible,"Let me be clear that my 1-star rating is not directed toward O. Palmer Robertson's writing, but at the quality of the printed material. My book arrived on time without any trouble. But after reading about 25% through it, the binding began peeling away (it's paperback). This means that by the time I read all the way through it, the book will probably not even have a cover.This is the first time I've seen a paperback do this and it is very frustrating. The worst part is that I've made significant notes in the book and I do not want to have to return it because I'll lose all my notes, so I guess I'm just stuck with it."
2,Too sloooooow,"The soloists should have been great, but the conductor takes everything at half-speed, knocking them off their game. This CD was a huge disappointment for me--Irmgard Seefried and Ferdinand Frantz are two of my favorite singers."
5,Informative and entertaining,"This is a quick read which provides excellent insight into the history and development of MSF as well as its current organization and on-the-ground operations. The historical component is well integrated into the many personal stories of physicians, logisticians, and other critical team members of MSF in the field. This book does a nice job balancing the positive and negative aspects of MSF's mission and how it is implemented. Even with the fair number of criticisms of the organization, I am still eager to be involved with such a remarkable group of people."
3,impersonal and repetitive,"I would say that Hope in Hell is a good read and an interesting book but I have to say that the style is very impersonal, very repetitive, very introductory and does not do justice to the many MSF volunteers who were interviewed for the book.It is impersonal because there is little more than a name and perhaps the country of origin given as the stories of volunteers are told. I read this book right after reading the Fast Food Nation in which the writer describes his interview subjects in a manner that enables the reader to have a mental picutre and develop a deep relationship with them.Hope in Hell reads as an introductory piece of writting. Half way through the book I still thought I was reading the introductory chapter.The sotries in this book were tragic and could've and should've been written in a heart wrenching style but the writer failed to write it so.I would recommend it as a book to skim through but not a book worth purchasing and adding to your collection."
2,Little new material,I liked -The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need- Although the new book makes many important points the material has been covered elsewhere. I didn't feel like I learned anything.
2,Boring book,"This book i must say was very boring. It repeats the same thing over and over. It mainly talks about Index funds as the cure, but i think someone could invest irrationally using index funds. This book would have been good giving real solutions on overcoming irrational investing. Simply saying buying an index fund does not cut it. A better and interesting book i would say is ""Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes-And How to Correct Them: Lessons from the New Science of Behavioral Economics"" by Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich."
5,Excerpts from the note of appreciation I wrote to the author,"I enjoyed ""Rational Investing"" immensely, and have wholeheartedly recommended it to friends. After (my second) reading...plus after reading Wm. Bernstein's new ""Four Pillars of Investing,"" and formerly reading your ""What Wall Street Doesn&#65533;t Want You To Know&#65533; book, as well as Charles Ellis' books, and many if not all of the learning articles on [URL] and your [URL] archives, I've gravitated from being a partial index investor over past years to (just now) using passive index funds exclusively for my entire equity portfolio.As a [retired] CFP and Masters in Wealth Management graduate, I truly appreciate the rarity of great investment sense that is presented in a readable and understandable fashion, and I've found no better source than your writings.Congratulations, and another well deserved ""well done""&#65533;Thanks again for the wonderful and most helpful read.Sincerely,Dennis&#65533;"
3,"Clever Ending, But not as Clever as it Could Be","This series set up a seemingly insoluble problem, and this book came up with a very clever solution. Then used a different solution. The basic idea of the series seems somewhat silly. (A terraformed planet sufers ecological catastrophe after a number of years equal to the number of years spent solving it? Why? Why not just terraform planet after planet, than move to new ones with FTL?) The mystery aspects of the series, the clever FTL method, and the way this series for once does NOT ignore the fact FTL means time travel make it unique. The ending was a slight disappointment, skipping clever solutions they proposed in favor of an overly complex one. It was also a little to ""cosmic"" in scale for me to really identify with what was going on."
1,L1400 USB Data Cable,"Junk! Sent with a CD that had a USB driver but wouldn't work on two different computers. Contacted the shipper, Bargaincell, but their only help was to send an email with links to various drivers for other cellphones or links that no longer existed. The email stated emphatically that they don't provide support for the product."
1,mis guided information,this product was listed as being for my phone..when it arrived the cable did not list my phone model number and the software listed all other models. it was misleading. and it never worked even messed up my phone a little. and i lost 5.00 in shipping because of the decpetion.
1,difficult to install,This product really needs Installation Assistance. Too many options and I spent 2 hours trying to figure it out. I'm going to call to get more info.ARRIVAL TIME = ***** 5 starsPRICE = ***** 5 starsInstallation and Ease = * 1 star
1,they stole my money,"I bought this product, for my cell wich was listed on their description, and it so happens that the software will not work, they did not sent the drivers, I would not do business with this people again.this has not only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time.Amazon should not permit them take people's money like that...Amazon suports those fakes."
4,Worth the wait,"After reading An Exchange of Hostages, my first question was when in the next one due? I needed to know how Andrej would fare. As kids, we used to taunt interrogators with ""Do you want the truth or just an answer?"" I've always believed an inquisition was only good for ""an answer."" The inquisitor will get the answer needed, rather than the truth. Susan Matthews shows us a man so skilled and competant as an inquisitor that he can find the truth, inspite of the means he is compelled to use.I, too, was compelled, and finished the book within 24 hours of getting my hands on it."
1,What is this? How did this get published?,"My objections with this book have nothing to do with graphic depictions of torture or lack thereof, and everything to do with the writing style, which is distractingly awful. She throws out a ton of names without clear explanation of who these people are, her third-person omniscient narration is difficult to follow as it shifts without warning through various POVs, and is riddled with pointless, annoying, and often contradictory asides. She also has a tendency to. Break up. Her sentences. In stupid ways. No joke.That aside, it's not too bad, but her horrible prose really overshadows any of the book's redeeming factors."
2,Quite Horrifying,"The descriptions of torture were truly awful, and the main character Andrej Koscuisko was truly a villain himself. I hope he learned the evils of his own acts, even if they were within Protocol. The Bench deserves to be overthown and destroyed.Torturing someone to obtain information or a confession is a crime. A confession obtained from torture is worthless, because the torture victim will admit to anything."
1,Home & Business Attorney Software,"The forms can not be printed with blank lines to allow users to enter information on a printed copy. Some documents are very crude and do not include any professional formatting (no headers to identify the document). This looks like Windows 3.1 software! It does not allow long file names and does not allow users to create folders when selecting ""File - Save As"". The most professional part of this software is the installation utility!"
2,Terrible..what a joke,"What a joke. I looked up the document for ""reponse to a creditor"" and found a useless form that I could have created myself without the help of this waste of money software."
1,Was apparently written for Windows 3.1,"This software is unbelievably bad. It appears to have been written for Windows 3.1, as it cannot deal with anything but 8.3 filenames. The Okay button for many dialogs is absolutely huge and placed behind text entry fields -- must be seen to be believed.The installer hangs at 99% or 100% under WinXP for at least 8 minutes, then proceeds. It never exits, though, and must be killed with task manager.I got this software bundled in the Money 2003 Suite, and paid a little extra to get it. Don't know how I'm going to get my money back for it."
4,Sizing Issue,"I have only worn my gloves for three bicycle rides, and only one of those was in a light rain. However, I think I can report the gloves are warm and well made. I like the fact that I don't feel the seams wearing sore spots in my hands; and I like the way the gloves allow me to grasp small items. The orange color and reflective strips are comforting when riding my bike next to a busy traffic lane.That said, I suggest buyers consider ordering a full size larger than they usually wear. For example, I usually wear size ""large"" gloves, but I ordered these gloves in ""extra large"" and still found them to be snug. I will never understand why clothing and shoe manufacturers cannot adhere to a standardization of sizes; but a ""large"" in these gloves would be a ""medium"" in most other brands.The size issue is the only reason I did not offer five stars."
3,Not as good as they seem.,"Considering these are supposed to be waterproof, somehow after working with them in the rain for a few hours, my hands would always end up never being dry. They do manage to keep your hands warm, however. They're good for maybe an hour or two but if you have to work outside, then they lose their effectiveness after a certain amount of time."
4,Great product.,I use these for my winter bike riding. They are good to about 30-45 degrees. Colder then that you need warmer gloves and hotter then that these are to warm. They help make you more visible with the color and reflective material.
2,Cheap,"You get what you pay for! The bed finally came after 3-4 weeks. We were missing pieces, and the threading was non existent on bolts. You do need a box spring for this and the slats and support are flimsy. We decided not to return b/c of all the hassle.We ended up going to home depot and buying new wood for the slats and support beam. The foot board broke when we were putting together, so that was fun.After everything was assembled the bed wasn't to measurement! there is a good 4 inch gap and it's at an angle. yeah, don't but this, we're using it to keep the mattress off the floor and saving up to buy a whole brand new QUALITY bedroom suite."
3,Delivered broken....,"I bought this bed since it was cheapest King size bed on Amazon. It was $250 ($25 Tax) including shipping. I was quite excited when I started opening it but soon realized that foot board had a minor crack in it. Headboard had one of the legs that came out of the overall headboard.. So I called for return/ replacement but I was told that since the item is sold/shipped by Home Decorators & not Amazon, it would be returned for full refund & I have to place a new order. They also offered a 50% refund if I keep it. I decided to keep it for $137. I fixed it & it has been good since then.Issues/Solution:- One issue that I had with this bed is that its side boards tend to go slant. The bed comes with a few wooden slates which you actually have to drill on both sides else the problem will not go away."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"The ophthalmoscope is alright, but the 4x magnification for the otoscope does not work for seeing the TM. If you try looking at your hand, you have to be a few mm away from the skin in order to see clearly. In other words, you cannot insert this thing far enough into the ear to clearly see without hurting the person you're looking at. Spring for something better because you'll eventually have to anyway if you actually want an otoscope that works."
2,Just a 1h20min CD,"Content is ok, but I was expecting more than just a bit more than one hour lecture on PMI."
5,excellent,This grease gun works and is made very well!Also got at a very good price compared to a local purchasepraise God
3,No grease storage,Got the order quickly but was dissappointed that the case does not have room for the two extra grease cartridges as shown.Hope they change the photo soon before it costs them any more customers.
4,Lincoln Cordless Grease Gun,I was pleased on how quick I received the product. But at this time I haven't used the grease gun as it was purchased for a Christmas gift.
5,farmer,"Nice grease gun for the price. Case did not have grease tube storage like another review said, I think it would be handy if it did, but still a good product!"
4,ok,good but after a while of continuous use you have to let the gun sit for a couple of minutes before more grease will come out.
4,Lincoln Rechargeable Grease Gun,"This grease gun is a heavy duty maintenance tool used to lube D-8 Cat's and other cargo handling equipment. It makes the mechanics job easier and hence, the proper preventative maintenance is always completed before the equipment is needed for work."
5,SAFETY WISE PRESENTS PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY FROM HOME INVAS,VERY INFORMATIVE!!! EVEN MY CHILDREN LEARNED FROM IT!!!
4,An absolutely beautiful Book,"As a Master Mason living in a country where Masonry doesn't publicly exist (China), I am always trying to find ties and ways to reenforce the Masonic learning I had when I was raised. This book is not the greatest for in-depth research, but is very comprehensive and, I feel, well organized. But that's not a reason to buy it. This is a cofee table book with lavish photography and illustrations that make it worth every penny of its purchase price. Illustrations included in this book are very comprehensive and is a great centerpiece for any masonic library."
5,The Sourcebook for Organizational Visioning,"I have used this book as a guide to visioning in a higher education environment, specifically, health care professional education.This book is the definitive resource for leading an organization to a new future. It clearly delineates the steps the leader should follow to bring the organization to a shared vision of its future which is inspirational yet achievable.The supporting rationale for the advantages of Visioning over conventional Strategic Planning is explained by the author.The progression from Vision to implementation of strategies is also treated in depth.I have used his book for nine years in two different institutions and consider it to be an indispensible part of my personal approach to leadership."
5,Excellent service,"I was very pleased with the book, Visionary Leadership, and the customer service. The book was in perfect condition, and I received it right away in the mail."
2,"""Disappointed""","This isn't a book on leadership at all. Rather, it would be a good sourcebook for a management or marketing division. To be honest, I couldn't read the whole book. The writing style was dry and the business of focus 'Prime Pet Foods' isn't a Forbes 500 company. In fact, I'm not sure it's an actual company at all. Maybe one day when I have nothing else to read I'll pick it back up and try to slog my way through it. No, probably not. There are just too many other, very good books on the subject to waste my time with this one."
4,Disturbing,A very well written story of a definitely demented man. The story goes deep into the mind (deeper than anyone should like to go) of a man living in his own twisted world. An excellent book.
2,For hardcore Michael McDowell fans only,"The late Michael McDowell was a successful novelist and screenwriter, but I'm not fond of this book. After finishing it, I felt like I had wasted my time.It was all atmosphere and no plot. Hardly anything happened!(If I remember right, it's about a crazy guy who is obsessed with some girl.)""Toplin"" was the first Michael McDowell novel I read. Although I disliked it, I saw potential and decided to read more of his books.It's a good thing I did, because I'm a big fan of his novelsKatie,The Elementals,Cold Moon Over Babylon, andGilded Needles.If you've already read those, you might be better off skipping ""Toplin"" and reading the Tabitha King/Michael McDowell novelCandles Burningor one of the novels he co-wrote under the pseudonyms Nathan Aldyne or Axel Young."
2,"Poor products, poor service","I have had my Visor PRO less than 6 months. The hotsync cradle has had to be replaced once already, and the software crashed and had to be reinstalled.A friend bought one at the same time, it was a complete lemon. She sent it back to be replaced and went through 3 different models in as many months before she finally gave up and bought another PDA. What a waste of money!And when you register the product with Handspring, they send you a coupon, with no info on any expiration, but when I tried to use it I was told it expires in 30 days. When I protested that they need to tell you about the 30 day limit when they send you the email, and asked to discuss it with a supervisor, I was ignored and have not been contacted again.Like many other reviewers, this is the first and last Handspring product I will buy."
4,Great Palm-O/S handheld!,"This is a great Palm-O/S based handheld unit. With 16MB of memory it offers plenty of storage; more than most Palm-based units on the market. The USB synchronization and rechargable battery are nice, too. A great device for those who want a 'workhorse' instead of a 'showhorse'. ;-)"
2,"Great when working, awful customer support","It's my first PDA. As a doctor I use it both for business and personal information. After owning it for about 8 months, the battery would no longer recharge, so I sent it back to handspring. Service was promt and relatively courteous except for one thing...they didn't fix the problem! The unit was returned to me with exactly the same malfunction. Mechanical breakdowns happen, but since the customer support isn't there to back up the product, I won't buy from Handspring again.To add some more. Finally got the problem fixed, but it recurred two more times. I am now the happy owner of a Sony Clie SJ20...compact, reliable, good screen resolution."
1,smells like old lady,"I bought this on description only. I did not like it at all, it smelled like ""old lady"" to me. My husband and kids hated the smell too. The bottle is nice though. Yes, I know, I should of never bought something I didn't actually know what it smelled like, but ya live and learn!"
1,Why was I reccomended this by Amazon?,"Apparently Claudia Christian -- the actress -- is in this DVD.Amazon suggested I get this because I bought the ""Babylon-5 Season 4"" DVD set, and she's an actress in that series.Is she in this DVD?Who is this 'Charlie Sheene' guy? He's the only one listed as an actor in the description.This is weird."
4,Does not work with Windows 2000,"I am pleased with much of this product so far, but I am dissatisfied that it does not work with Windows 2000. It is great for preparing a basic will. It also offers many other legal documents. I especially like the Living Trust for establishing a plan for your children they lose both parents. There is another product called Kiplinger's Home and Business Attorney, which retails at [$]. It seems to include the WillPower functionality as well as much more. I might recommend that you consider it instead."
1,Save Your Valuable Estate $$$ By Not Buying This Junk,"This program looks like it was designed in 1973. I go through the rigamarole, and the thing crashes. Every time. This program is totally outdated. I'm on a Mac, OSX."
1,If only I didn't own a home...,"I have installed and uninstalled this thing five times on my PC. It seems to work fine unless I input something about owned property. Once I do that, it crashes and won't restart. There's NO real help in the program and NO online support. Save yourself $30, many wasted hours, and a big headache by buying something else."
1,A Piece of Junk,"This program is a piece of junk. Once I input my personal data and click ""finish"", the program crashes. There is no help and the web technical support function is the usual condescending ""reinstall the program and reboot your computer"", as if the user is an idiot like the people who designed this program. There is no way to email tech support. Save your money."
1,Who cares about these people?,"This book spent its entire length being almost interesting, almost compelling, almost enjoyable.Sophie was cardboard. The author kept hinting at how her past had affected her. There is a sentence on the last page which made a lot of Sophie's character make sense, but by then it was too late.The story idea was interesting, but the author was unable to make me care about any of the characters."
2,Save your time and money!,"This would be a good book if the first half was condensed to a few chapters. It took many tries to get through the first half of this book!It was intriguing how the husband was being minipulated through hypnosis, but the ending was a little too pat."
3,Disappointing Resolution,"The plot ascends through the entire story. One expects a far more convincing and thrilling resolution of the mystery ""who is the man who is now Sophie's husband"". However, one gets the feeling that author is tired of writing this book that she intended to be romantic but has turned out to be a wonderful mystery/suspense. So the ending is very sloppily pulled together. Although in retrospection it pulled together some loose seeds planted early in the book, it was unbelievable and lacks the intensity of the rest of the book. That made for a disappointing finale to a wonderful story."
4,Great aid for your atlas on a fishing trip in the Southern Apps.,"The author's knowledge of the territory, exact locations and land marks is very helpful. He does not go in to much, if any, detail about insect life in the streams. Overall a very good book in rating streams, fishing quality, and helping you get there."
3,"Good read, albeit a bit biased","A good book, but seemed to be a bit biased towards Jacob's home state of GA. They had the most comprehensive reviews and got more waters than others. To his credit, it is still a good read with some decent information on access points. I'd recommend a book more concentrated to the area you are going, but for all regions of Southern Appalachia, this is not bad considering there is not many books that cover this many miles of trout waters."
5,Perfect,"It is the best choice for tailgating bbq. It is small, effective and ridiculously easy to use. I call it ""perfect""."
5,Insight for the future of education,"I was fortunate to have been mentored by Fred S. Keller. He was an amazing man, with great patience for a fellow like myself. I hadn't seen him for many years when this book first came out so he was pretty old when he wrote it. But it is a brilliant piece of work. It takes the premise that we need to stop educating our children to an average of 70% when indeed they can learn 100% given the proper motivation, presentation and time. Children are not all of the same ability, so a school year should vary for them. Brilliant kids might learn 100% of the standard curriculum in a month while less able children can learn the same in several months. He proposes some ways of achieving this. Having worked at the Institute for Behavioral Reseach with Fred, I know this to be true. It even worked with very disturbed autistic children. This book is still way ahead of our current methods of education. We can all learn from it."
1,Watch out....,My friend & I both bought the Rebel G two years ago while taking a photography course. In May of this year her shutter stoppped working. She had it repaired for $160.00. Now last month my shutter also went... while I was taking the pictures of the new Mayor at his celebration election night. My friend's camera is now again having shutter problems..... I have had an ongoing dialog with Canon regarding this... and to date the only satisfaction offered to both of us is to mail the cameras to the factory.. they will do a free inspection.. then we will pay for the repair.... and receive a 6 month warrenty... that is not acceptable.... because my friends camera is just past the 6 months & she needs a repair. Canon states that this is not a defect... But it just can't be a coincidence that they would both have the same problem. We bought them from different stores.
1,unfair,the item my son received was defective and will cost more to fix than the original $125 spent on the item. This was for a school project and he can't even use it. Plus as a widow I am now out $125.
3,Buy It!,I bought this camera last minute before we went to the Cher concert and I wasn't disappointed! My old SLR died the day of the concert and I bought this camera in a rush --- and it worked out great! I used 1600 speed film with the 75-300 lens and got great up-close shots of Cher. It's worth every penny!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA,"I bought my Canon Rebel G about three years ago after owning a Minolta XG-1 manual focus camera for about 15 years. I had to repair my Minolta once when the f-stop began sticking after about 13 years. Finally the ol' girl gave out an I had to buy a new camera. I looked around and finally settled on the Rebel G. Immediately I could tell the difference in the photos. My old Minolta's photos were far sharper and more focused. Now, after owning my Canon Rebel G for only three years the auto-focus has completely given out and all I am left with from a trip to Zion Nat'l Park are my memories and 11 rolls of blurry photos. To repair this camera would cost over $150--more than half the cost of a crummy camera. I'm going to throw it away and buy something worth my money. I've had nothing but disappointment from this camera. I would suggest spending a little more money and getting something that works. I hear Pentax is making a dependable low-buget SLR."
4,Great order,"I ordered this camera, it is about 11 years old. i got everything, manual, etc, mentioned on the product page. i received well packed in good condition. it is used but it was not broken or anything, little scratches, no big deal.thanks a lot"
4,"Brown & Sharpe 75.116550 6"" Dial Caliper, SS Black Face","I received the B&S 75.116550 6"" dial caliper SS Black Face yesterday, a day earlier then projected. The instrument seems to be very well made. Time will tell how well it will hold up, but I satisfied. It has the feel of a well made tool, and that's what I wanted, and that's what I paid for. Moving the jaws to measure is not a light touch, it moves with some resistance. My previous one made in China moved very easily. I'm guessing the closer tolerances in this Swiss made instrument are the reason. The black face is easy to read, and has dots between the .001"" markings, very nice."
5,Good product,"The caliper is very nice, almost all metal construction. Only complaint is the case scratched the face of it within a week, have a piece of cotten in there to protect it for the time being. I bought my friend a starrett case and it is a really good buy for $15. Ill be getting one of those for my caliper."
1,Not as described.,"The product description is a Brown & Sharpe Dial Caliper. However, the product received was a TESA by Hexagon Metrology Dial Caliper. The item was sent back today. I hope my credit is processed quickly."
1,Don't bother!,"I bought one of these and I only used it once before it stopped cutting, and it didn't even cut well the first time. I had to go over several times. It was horrible.I did not purchase it through Amazon, which I have to note because I take the reviews at Amazon very seriously. I just happened to be in a store and needing one, picked this up. I have had a Wahl for 6 years, which was previously owned by my Dad, and it still cuts perfectly. It will need to be replaced soon, tho, unless I really give it a thorough cleaning."
2,"First 3 cuts were great, then POC","Worked nicely the first few times, then despite cleaning and adjusting -- per the care and instructions -- I'm shopping for new one. Very cheap..."
1,Don't waste your time,"Terrible product. Worked for a few months, did not respond well to wear-and-tear. Oiled once as instructed and they were never the same. Highly dubious manufacturing. Skip it unless you're interested in investing $10 in clippers every few months, which some people are cool with, but I'm not."
1,Lasted 5 min. Pathetic.,This piece of junk lasted just five minutes before the blades stopped moving. I took it apart to clean it (as you're supposed to do after every use) but there was no fixing it. I've checked around on the internet and found that other people had the same problem. Nice Job Vidal Sasson / Chinese manufacturing.
1,Vidal Sasson Haircutting Kit,"I bought these at Canadian Tire. My wife always cuts my hair, and they were blunt from the getgo. She'd tried running them thru my hair 4 times and still couldn't cut properly. Gave up after 10 minutes and returned them for a replacement. And they are no better - and we gave up after 2 minutes. Returning them tomorrow for a full refund. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - don't buy them."
1,waste of money,Dont waste your money on this.this is the worst product i have ever bought .its build cheap .small bottle of mineral oil that came with it had hole in it and oil was all over the clipper and then there was a tag that says oil blades frequently . extensions that comes with it are junk too.
5,A definite must have,"First off, the price on this CD is a steal for what you are geting.This is front to back, head-noddin [...]It's almost as if Madlib and Kankick had a contest going here to see who could produce the phattest joint on this CD. Every track seems to be around that 90bpm speed (which is the ideal speed for head-noddin).On top of all that, Declaime is an MC I really enjoy. You can tell he's in the game for the love of it, not the money or fame. He seems to have fun, not getting caught up on trying to be the best, most technical lyricist on the planet like so many other cats. Plus he definitely has a signature voice that stands out from the average MC.If you are new to the names Declaime, Madlib, and Kankick, do yourself a favor and cop anything out there with them on it. While you are at it, look for Lootpack, WildChild, and Quasimoto (The Unseen is a classic)"
3,Missing an important section,"At first glance I was very pleased with this purchase and even began filling out the initial pages. It asked tons of questions which I loved. I wanted a book that would keep all those memories that I am sure to forget. After looking more closely though, I was disappointed to discover that this book does not have section for monthly updates for the first year. This is something that was a must for me. I want to be able to document what's going on with my little guy at 4 months, 5 months, and so on. Because of this, I purchased another baby record book. It was by Carter's as well, but it is the ""Child of Mine - Baby Boy Memory Book"". It does have pages for monthly updates. Hope this helps!"
5,Perfect :o),"This is exactly what I was looking for! Perfect for parents not wanting to jot down every bitty detail, but include the specials ""firsts"" and capture it with pictures. The book begins with giving info about mommy and daddy, then about the shower, leading up to the birth. The main parts include areas for ""firsts,"" such as teeth, words, laughs, walk, and holidays. The last part of the book devotes a page for ages 2-4 to record a picture and what some favorites were during that time."
5,Beautiful Baby Book,we purchased this baby book for our son and we love it. it has a wonderful sports theme with lots of pages for all the milestones!Great Purchase!
3,crushed,The cd arrived in a plain paper envelope and the case was crushed into pieces .Since case was crushed disc just sliding around in broken pieces of plastic in the paper envelope .
3,too much fluff,"It didn't matter that ""Camellia"" was book 3 in a series by Ginny Aiken. When I read the back cover, I had to pick up this book! Unfortunately, this story wasn't all its description promised. Yes, there was mystery and a sweet romance, but you had to get almost halfway through the book to get to the good stuff."
3,"Book three in the ""Bellamy's Blossoms"" series","Outgoing, compassionate, young widow Camellia Bellamy Sprague finds her peace of mind shattered when her trusted doctor retires--in the final trimester of her pregnancy. Worse yet, his replacement is altogether too attractive for Camellia's comfort.Searching for more out of life, Dr. Stephen Hardesty has given up a lucrative future to open a family practice in Bellamy. But his dreams are threatened when the lovely Camellia Sprague refuses to see him. If he can't gain her trust, how will the other townspeople learn to accept him?When a crisis hits the Bellamy Blossoms, Stephen and Camellia are thrown into an adventure that will change their lives forever."
5,The Earth Chronicles Expeditions; Journeys to the Mythical p,"This book is in common with Zechairia Sitchin`s other works of Earth shattering importance. His books deal with the surpressed and un-told truths of OUR TRUE HISTORY AND BIRTH as a species of intellect, and spiritual ( even though he keeps himself apart from using his own take on things, he only writes the facts,that which Mr. Sitchin is ""unsurpassed"" in.) beings. Mr.Sitchin books are found in the ""new age"" and other type of headings, this I think should be saved for books that can not be proven factual ( or at least the ""info"" given ) . The new book involves Mr. Sitchin and his remarkable information hunt and quest. This gives the reader the aspect that he saw and lived in some of the most debated places on Earth ( the Temple mound etc.,) I highly recommend this book and his other works to anyone who whishes to understand our true roots and history."
4,Somewhere in middle lies the truth.,"Fascinating book. I don't see ancient aliens the way Sitchin sees them. Not after reading the Ark of Millions of Years. They weren't merely explorers looking for a primitive race to feed them grapes all day. They had a mission. They came from somewhere, and they survived the flood of Noah by being off-world when it occurred. Then they returned and kept up their work, only with a much more resistant and noble race of man.Read The Ark of Millions of Years to get the middle road story. The whole story."
5,Once again Sitchin hits the mark!,Once again Sitchin informs his audience of the many places he has travelled and written about. A MUST-HAVE book for all of Sitchin's fans.
1,Don't bother,"I thought this book would be about the Great Pyramid based on it's description in a catalog. It started off good in the first few pages but then hared off on insane tangents about how alien gods had a war and the pyramids were leftovers from said war. It also went into how they were some sort of landing strip for their spaceships extending to Mount Sinai and blathered on about the advanced techonlogy they supposedly left behind. Utter new age nonsense but it was kind of like a train wreck, you want to stop looking (i.e. reading) but you somehow can't seem to turn away. Don't waste the time and/or money on this drivel."
1,nothing here,Sitchen doesn't back up any of his info. I found the book lacking of any substance. If you are an avid reader/researcher of history and religion(s) this book offers nothing which might further your search.
1,Nothing new here,"Unless you want to become a card carrying memeber of the ""Zach Sitchin saves the universe club"" or you have plenty of money and just want to waste it buying hard cover books because you know the author is going to die soon save your money."
1,"After read it, we know exactly why it's LOST","The Title should been just ""The Lost"" or ""The Lost Books"", but even implying that they should be in the Bible is stupid. The Bible is all we need."
5,What the preachers don't want you to know!,"Excellent book. After watching a program on Discovery, I went in search of this book and found it here at Amazon. A real eye opener! Why? It explains why the books were left out of the canon. These books didn't add to the ability to control the masses. A great read!"
4,Clarifies A Lot!,"As a student of the gospel, clarity is everything. The Lost Books of The Bible allow a student to achieve a better grasp of the ""why(s)"" in the Word."
3,Lost Books of the Bible,"It's unlikely that Christ said or did some of the things written in this book. I know he is all powerful but it's out of character for him to strike dead a few boys who slighted him in his childhood. He was about forgiveness and second chances. The stories are interesting to read, however. Just keep in mind what Jesus was really like."
3,Interesting but...,"You must have a very open mind to enjoy reading this book. It has strange images and stories. Some may be able to read this book and enjoy it for what it is. But, I repeat, if you are not prepared to read this with an open mind, you may find this book disturbing."
3,Think About It,"I would imagine that, after reading this book, the similarity between myth and current belief would be clearer; but I guess this isn't the case. It seems obvious why these books were eliminated from the Bible: in ""Infancy I"", Jesus is portrayed as an ancient version of Carrie. This and other examples show what nonsense second-rate mythologers can create, as opposed to the more interesting tales spun by first-rate storytellers."
1,Bad Compilation,"Although compiled by someone who is supposedly an English expert, the manner in which verses are compiled in the book is much like ready on very long run-on sentence. More thought should have been given to a format that is more readable."
3,interesting Opnions,"Interesting slant on how things might have been. Outlandish in some cases, but fascinating if taken as opinion and not fact."
3,"interesting, but not easy reading","This book is a fascinating glimpse into the world as it was when the New Testament was being compiled. It is not, however, light reading."
3,Not the usual apocrypha!,"I bought this book thinking it was The Apocrypha. It is not, at least not what most books entitled ""The Apocrypha"" are. It contains interesting material, most of which will appeal to Roman Catholic readers. If you are looking for Judith, Tobit, Esdras, and the Maccabbees, none of them are in this book. If you are looking for legendary stuff about Jesus' infancy and childhood, and that of his mother Mary, you will enjoy this.Oh, one other thing you might find annoying (I did): even though this was translated in the early 20th century, the translators wrote it in pseudo-Elizabethan English. I guess they thought if they translated it into modern English, people would be offended and not think it was ""holy."""
4,Okay,"We recently purchased this for use in our new home. It is great on one hand because it does dry pretty quickly, and it is pretty inexpensive. It is very easy to use, but the material is a little lighter than what we wanted. We had some medium-sized holes in the walls (from door knobs), and this airy spackling would not do the trick."
1,Where to begin?,"This is a bad movie. I don't mean in a ""so bad it's kinda funny"" way, but in a ""so bad I'd rather do almost anything than finish watching it"". The acting, sets, cinematography, story, and special effects are non-existent--It looks like someone a bunch of cable TV station employees threw together during a particularly uninspired lunch hour.Even one star is a generosity forced on me by Amazon. If they offered the option of none, I would have chosen that.And don't ask me how it ends--I honesty didn't make it that far."
3,Curious Little Film,"Okay, I LIKED the Devil make-up in here, very nicely done. Our detectives coulda, woulda, shoulda been smarter, but this is actually an okay B-Horror, and it has Randal Malone in a supporting role! I just wish the director would fine better sets than bland walls; the house in here has lots of eye candy, but the dull, boxy apartments and sheds foster a cheapness to straight-to-DVD fare as do medium and static shots."
2,RAZOR COULD HAVE DONE BETTER OR WORSE AS THE CASE MAY BE,"This is the worse ""bad movie"" Razor has to offer. Stephanie Beaton, whose topless body is the main or only attraction of all their films, keeps her top on. The special effects of the rubber chicken and fake goat's head (recorded goat sounds being played to make us think it is alive) were LOL comical. The dialouge was funny at times. Randal Malone, a Razor regular stars as Adrian, a man attempting to bring Satan to earth. ""Bad hair"" Randal learned his acting by watching Divine. The movie freely mixes voodoo with satanism. There is some ""simulated"" sex, although the participants keep their clothes on. As a bad movie goes, it needed to be worse to be more entertaining."
4,creepy but funny,"I work in an office environment. all but one of the men thought they were ""cool"" and ""funny"" all but one of the women thought they were ""creepy, ""gross"" and ""disgusting"" One guy really wanted to get some for his kids. We had a laugh out of them at lunch."
2,Doesn't stick or crawl on flat wall,looks goodbut i bought it so i will put the on wall but this does not stick to wall or crawl on wall as product description claimed
4,"Urban, hip mood",Cool urban groove sets the mood. Electronic version of Galactic? Dub mix of 70's chase scene music? Would HuggyBear drive a Cadilac Escalade? Not desperately new.
4,Confederate flag,"This on good flg flag flag lfag of good quality quality and size to display for all to see, a little differant from the regular CSA flags."
5,5 Stars for a beginners program,"Included with camera purchase. A very good program for the beginner, a little to light on the editing features for the more advanced users. Excellent for quick cropping and resizing. Good for average improvements in sharpness and brightness. A clone tool would be helpful."
1,Good for Beginners? Maybe. For an Experienced User? No.,"Arcsoft Photostudio is included with the Canon LiDE 20 Scanner, and is easily the weakest part of the package. It's incredibly cumbersome, and cannot handle large images, even on a machine with 768MB of RAM. I've uninstalled it, and use LView Pro instead."
1,Not made well,"I'm eleven and I have mostly all the SailorMoon Manga books. But this doll is NOT well made. The clothing looks horrible, their twice the size of the doll, and the rest of the dolls(like SailorMars,SailorJupiter) don't have wands."
1,horrible doll,This doll is totally off. She looks absolutely nothing like the cartoon charactor and she looks fat because her outfit is ten times too big. I think that the company should have spent alot more time on the doll. They could have looked at a picture of Sailor Moon so they could have maybe made it look like the cartoon charactor. Don't buy this doll even though it is a good price. There are other Sailor Moon dolls that are a lot better even though non of them are perfect I think this one is the worst....
2,Misleading Photo,"The photo displayed on this page WILL NOT be the doll you'll be receiving. My friend purchased this doll for me and it looks nothing like the one pictured here. The one displayed is the best doll ever made. I personally own one but it's weared and missing a wand.The one you'll receive will be a baby faced doll so if you're a MAJOR fan, DON'T BUY IT."
2,Incompatibility with OS X,"Seems like a superb scanner; however, the software is over a year old and is only usable in OS 9. Very disappointed because, as a Switcher I am on a steep learning curve with OS X and do not want to tackle OS 9. A February review here reported on the same problem and it is now the end of September and no Epson fix. A high priced product with lousy support!Have installed on my PC laptop in lieu of the iMac so am forced back into the PC world."
2,Dust under glass,"Very disappointed to receive this expensive scanner with dust under the glass. Otherwise, installed Windows XP on a year old computer, scanner installed fine and works fine, except for theunder-glass dust. May return it, but a reviewer of another Epson product writes that they did that and got another one with dust under the glass."
1,Dead out of the box...,"I bought this product based on its rave reviews. I installed the software, hooked it up, and...nothing. Just a flashing red light in the front. When I consulted the manual, its advice was ""consult your dealer or EPSON."" For a product right out of the box??? I contacted EPSON, and the technician had me unplug it from the power strip and plug it into a wall socket. Not unexpectedly, this did nothing to solve the problem. Then she suggested I contact a repair center. For a brand new product??? I'm returning it to Amazon for a replacement, hoping I just got the bad apple in the lot. But for now, my rating has to stay at one star."
1,Professional Photographer,Buyer Beware. I bought two of these scanners and both were defective. The first one had a large piece of plastic shaving under the scanning glass. The second one did not operate as the scanning light did not illuminate and I had to return that one too. I really liked the features that this scanner offered but I am not convinced of the reliablility of this product and would not recommend. If you decide to buy it-check your unit out closely when you get it home.
3,"Solid Scanner, Shaky USB Interface, Weak Epson Support","The Epson 2450 Perfection is a good scanner, but I was very disappointed with the incompatibility of the USB interface with an add-in USB 2.0 card (Belkin F5U220 - not a hub). I am using WinXP Home. Using this setup, the scanner prescans, but it cannot complete any final scan without an error. It works OK using a USB 1.1 interface, but very slowly on high-density scans (35 mm slides, film). I solved the speed problem by switching to the firewire interface. (Epson does not supply the firewire cable.) Epson customer service was quite unhelpful, blowing me off with the convenient theory that only USB interfaces on motherboards can be expected to work properly with their equipment (where is that in their specs?). I'm not alone with this problem as a Google search will reveal."
1,Check out the 2450 before you buy,"I don't know about other customers, but my 2450 is worthless to me. It looked good and got good reviews and for my interest in photography I thought this was the answer to my needs. I assumed that it really would work with windows XP. That's questionable. Epson doesn't write the SmartPanel software and there have been many issues with that. After having new, updated software installed from Newsoft and the SmartPanel still didn't work, I then received an e-mail from Newsoft which said that there likly would be problems with the new version too. A phone call to Epson brought no resistance and a quick offer of a refund. That alone might have saved a customer for future purchases of Epson products. But not this 2450."
5,The Working Applications of Tiger and Crane,The Tiger and Crane form shown in this video is clearly the same exact form taught to Master Kong by Master Lum Jo..there have been no changes made in this video by Master Kong from the original form as created by the origining hung family the movements of the famous Tiger Crane set are demonstrated by Master Kong in the video are the same applications that have been taught to my sifu by master kong's student sifu Mike Marshall. These applications are very effective and I highly recommend this video to anyone with a serious interest in martial arts as well as any serious hung gar practitioner.
5,Buck Sam Kong Rawx,"Ok, I've studied under one of Sifu Kong's students, Sifu Ed Lane in Bellingham Washington, studying Hung Gar and Choy Li Fut. This book is very helpful, although it is a different form than the beginning form you learn. Buck Sam Kong is the president of the American Sui Lum Pai (Shao-lin) federation and is a very respected Sifu in the world.The video I know nothing about. You all should write Amazon and tell them to change their advertising of the book instead of posting angry remarks here. One is fine to warn us! Thank you by the way, I almost bought this book again for the video :)-Walter"
5,it is great,"i think it is great anything by george michael is brilliant, he is such a talented artist,,"
4,A good guide,"I got this while in California where a lot of people use VHF on the waterways. Now that I am in Oregon I find that the VHF is not used as it should be. To me that means that this book is useful to those who find themselves in waterways where VHF is used. This is not a fault with the book. So, if you are on the Columbia River you can get by without knowing all the ins and outs of VHF."
5,An exhaustive survey of Henry FitzEmpress's career presented with an approachable narrative style.,"W. L. Warren's excellent monograph on the first Plantagenet king displays a superb narrative style and an authoritative thoroughness of detail, which nonetheless remains surprisingly approachable for a work of this length and depth. This depth is remarkable: one can open the book to any chapter and read it independently without feeling that one is missing key details. Yet the book manages to steer free of a sense of drudgery or redundancy, even while effecting such an admirable encapsulated quality for its chapters. I can hardly wait to read his book on King John."
4,Fascinating & Authoritative,"This classic biography provides a fascinating and authoritative look into the life of one of medieval England's most infamous rulers. Warren expertly illuminates the entirety of Henry's life and reign, including his tumultuous relationships with his queen, his sons, and Archbishop Becket. Part of the English Monarchs Series."
1,Tedious reading with a poor narrative sense.,"The author clearly knows their topic. It is a pity they are unable to develop a clear and compelling narrative to the life of Henry II. Details, then details within details, thicken this soupy ""read"" until all sense of pleasure and color in reading about the life of Henry II evaporate. This is not a book for the general reader, even one with much background in the Middle Ages. Instead, ""Henry II"" is for scholars in search of finely woven exposition about the history of Henry II who do not require a flowing, interesting narrative."
5,Lovely,"I bought this necklace because it was very on sale, and I was surprised by how much I loved it when it arrived. The beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture, which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit. It's a bold necklace, but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse."
3,Violet Pendant Necklace,This necklace came all tangled with a bead that had fallen off. Was not work shipping back to exchange. The necklace quality was not a nice as seen. I was disappointed. I do not know how this company could post it for such a high original price.
3,"Very Pretty,but Repetitious and Finally Boring,Alyssa Milano","Could use a plot. Two girls, other than Alyssa, are dead boring. (Alyssa becomes mildly boring after 15 minutes or so.) Not a serious exersize video."
5,Alyssa Milano-Need I say more,"This is the beautiful girl,turning into a woman right before you're very eyes,through each stretch and musical number!Guys who buy this may have to buy another later,so don't use that still frame button and slow motion button so much!"
5,Cult Classic,The music is terrible. The Fashion is horrible. The dancing is awful. The workouts are laughable. But it's badness is the genius of its greatness. A must for any Alyssa Milano fan because you won't be able to take your eyes off of her.
5,"Inspirational, uplifting, inspiring...must have","This is a wonderful CD with inspirational songs by an inspirational musician celebrating respect for, and the richness of all people and cultures! This is engaging music you want your children and grandchildren to grow up with! All children, from pre-school to college will love it. Buy it today!"

4,The Original Cast Wins Over,"Andrea McArdle can never be replaced, and though this movie's version plays closer to the musical, I feel that if you want a timeless classic cd of this wonderful musical, get either the Original Broadway cast recording or the 1982 Aileen Quinn film soundtrack. Though the 1982 film wasn't closest to the musical, the singing was better in some respects. Alicia Morton was good but sounded too high pitched and young for an 11 year old Annie. While Aileen and Andrea played Annie as a normal down to Earth kid, Alicia seemed to be trying to sound like a pop star. I feel that you should most certaintly get the Original or the 1982 version if you want a good recording, because the 1999 one cannot compare aside from decent performances by the adults."
5,The Best Annie Ever!,"Ever since I was a little girl, I loved the show, the movie, everything. When I heard that they were redoing it on a commercial, I stood up and screamed ""Kristen Chenoweth! "" Due to the fact that she is one of my favorite preformers. I don't want to go too much into the movie, but it was great! True, this TV version was a bit cut-down as opposed to others, but the music was just fantastic. I had already owned the oringinal Broadway cast of Annie, but was getting tired of hearing Andrea McArdels wining voice, that sounds like she's screaming for help. So I bought this one, and I absolutly love it. This version puts a new twist on songs like ""NYC"" and ""Easy Street."" They are the kind of songs that will stick in your head, but you will love them. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
4,"Finally, A Decent NEW Annie","After being so incredibly disappointed in the Aileen Quinn/Carol Burnett version of ""Annie,"" I was a bit skeptical when I heard that another version was coming out. I was a HUGE fan of the stage show and was fortunate enough to see the original cast on Broadway when I was 15. This new Disney ""Annie"" sticks very closely to the broadway show. Thankfully there is no Asp or Punjab. Miss Hannigan is not a drunken sleaze. How nice that the ridiculous song ""Dumb Dog"" was left out. Instead we got a great, wholesome, family ""Annie."" Alicia Morton was wonderful. As were Victor Garber and Audra McDonald. Kathy Bates played Hannigan just right. The highlight on the soundtrack, however, is the INCREDIBLE Andrea McArdle as star-to-be in NYC. How appropriate that she would sing Laurie Beechman's part from the original broadway cast. This soundtrack is missing a few of my favorites songs -- but all in all is fantastic. Thank you Disney for giving us ""Annie"" as Annie should be."
5,Appealing for all ages!,"We loved this movie and love the CD! My daughter is 3 and she sings almost verbatim to Maybe, Tomorrow and Little Girls.I liked this version of the movie better than the version w/Carol Burnett as Ms. Hannigan. This is a great way to promote participation in singing and music appreciation for your kids."
3,fun to look through,"I enjoy these old surf posters. I bought this with the idea of taking out pages and framing for decoration, but never got around to it and now we are out of wall space."
5,Wheatena,I bought the Wheatena for my father who gives it a rave review. I wouldn't rate it myself because I don't eat it.
5,Yum!,"Wheatena Hot Cereal 20 oz - 6 Unit PackI've been eating Wheatena since I was a small child--I'm 71--and it's as good now as it was back then. It has an interesting and, to me, unusual texture in which the grains are quite distinct (but so small that they aren't ""chewy"") and a distinct wheaty texture. It's hard to find in stores now, at least in Idaho, but it's well worth the effort to get it from Amazon. And it also does well as a cooked grain in bread!"
1,not good,"everything is a ""CLARIFIED ADAPTATION"" in ohebsion's book. When I found out, I was livid. How can you clarify la rochefoucauld? The man spent his LIFE clarifying HIMSELF!If you try to quote anything from this book, you will look like a moron, like the ""author"". Juts gain the knowledge from the actual texts and DO NOT buy this crock. I am going to use this book as target practice."
5,awesome,if you like low budget horror comedy movies this is the one to get this is a very funny movie a lot better than some of those big budget movies
2,Disney Kitchen,"Thank goodness I found My Disney Kitchen on Amazon! I had originally bought this game for my daughter. However, my 5 year old autistic boy loves this game. The old cd got so scratched up that it wouldn't work anymore. I bought it here on Amazon and now he can play it again. My son loves the part where you make cakes and eggs and pancakes. He also is water obsessed and can fill the sink in the Disney Kitchen and listen to the sounds it makes without making a mess in my kitchen! :)"
1,Stupid Disney,"I was sooo excited to get the game finally after years of wanting it. My cousin is the perfect age for this game and i wanted to get it for her to play and have fun like i did when her age. The game came early and seemed to be in good condition but when opened and installed....THE GAME DIDN'T WORK!!! So take this disney, i am going to rate bad on your game and never go to disneyland again.Courtney <3"
5,Monty Beret,Beret arrived in a timely manner. Price was good. Quality of beret was outstanding. I plan to order another in a different color.
3,Wool Beret switcheroo,"Although the beret I received was very nice, it was not what I ordered. I ordered a plain black one and received a red one with a ribbon. Luckily, since I had no time to send it back, it worked out for the friend I ordered it for."
4,I've always loved Lou Grant,"It was my favorite show when it was first broadcast, and it has aged well. Have you ever noticed that Joe Rossi (from Lou Grant) and Joel Fleishsman (from Northern Exposure) are the same character?"
1,Not Worth the Money,Nostalgia caused me to buy this. It was a mistake. I would not recommend anybody spend money for one episode and though I like Ed Asner - this show was pretty shallow in the beginning episode.
3,Good overview,"I note that further down a reviewer suggest that people from the UK will not like this book as it ""reveals too much"", well as a reviewer from the UK I actually didn't find this to be true. There is little that is stated definitively here, rather things are 'alluded to', which is the way it should be.The problem is always going to be that traditional witchcraft includes so many and varied traditions, with teachings that are greatly at odds with each other, that any attempt to provide a definitive book on the subject is likely to be beset with problems. However, despite the inherent problems of writing an overview of such a diverse subject, this is a good & solid book that tackles the subject well. It is a worthy addition for anyone wanting an overview of modern traditional witchcraft."
3,L-Carnosine,I don't think it has made any difference. I took it for 6 months and have now stopped. If I notice a difference not taking it I will try it again.
4,Meets my needs,"I take L-carnosine as part of my doctor recommended cardio nutitional program. I like the taste and and the price seems reasonable. Would orefer it in a liquid or powder form, since I mix it ito smoothies, and the gel caps leave unpleasant bits and pieces in the drink. Therefore, I usually take extra time to empty the capsules into the smoothie. Would be nice not to have that extra step."
1,"It is from 2002, ancient, outdated, incompatible.","This Slackware is almost 10 years old and shouldn't be offered. It only confuses those people who start with Linux. It will not work on today's hardware, it has no drivers at all, it is all different today. On the moment of writing, the current version of Slackware is 13."
5,Fun book with great facts,Our 6 year old looks these books and I love that he is actually learning. Perfect for a level 3 reader and good length!
5,Works great for Dell Precision M90,"Powered my M90 without a problem for several hours from the front socket in my Prius. Nice and compact. The hing joint feels a little flimsy so I wouldn't tug on it too much, but can't complain for $30 (well, $40 when I bought it a month ago)."
2,Always the same from this company,"I'm a rather accomplished shade tree mechanic having done everything from simple tune up stuff to replacing entire engines in a good 1/2 dozen cars of all makes and models.This book, as all this companies writtings, is not for the 1st timer. It is really only good for the most simplest of tasks like getting a general idea of where the wiring harness goes or roughly what is entailed in changing a wheel axle. It is NOT going to allow the un-initiated do any serious kind of work on their vehicle.This book is however inexpensive. If you are really going to be doing some serious work on your jeep AND you are not confident about mechanic work in general you will not be happy with this purchase. I'd suggest you buy a real Shop Manual and expect to pay about $100.00, it will be worth every penny.Happy wrenching."
5,Awesome book! Every Jeep Owner should own this book!,"This is a well laid out and easy to follow book that I think every Jeep Owner should own at least one copy of. This is my second book, since the first book I used soo much that the pages started falling out and disappearing!"
4,Learning How To Learn,I bought this book for a class that I am taking as part of my Master's Degree in Education. The book is well written and easy to understand. The best part of the book is that it is rife with examples and real world classroom experiences to illustrate the chapters. I definitely recommend this book.
3,"Good research templates, but too long...","If I was just rating the research tools in this book, the rating would be higher. There are great templates that show you how to format a research paper, what your timeline should be, etc. The actual templates were most helpful. There are also anecdotes from real life teacher researchers which I found to be too ""fluffy"" and not nearly as helpful. I tended to scan and/or skip over those. Others might find those helpful however."
3,OK,"Good gameplay. I was expecting a more You Don't Know Jack-esque style (I Love YDKJ) but c'est la vie. Should be good for when I have my next party. Overall very good and challenging. Thanks Amazon, for a quick and efficient delivery."
5,A Guided Tour of the Political History of the United States,"I bought this book in the USA in 1989 when on holiday and found it one of the most useful books I have ever read. Each document has a few pages outlining the document itself, such as the Gettysburg Address, and the historic context in which it was delivered. I found the section on the Constitution of the USA particularly helpful in understanding the political origins of the country I was visiting. Thoroughly recommended."
3,Better than I thought,"Due to the fact there aren't many intro to skate tapes out there, I thought it was pretty good"
4,excellently written,I thought this book is really great. But I think this book should show its back cover so if someone wants to do a research then they can just look they don't have to go out and buy the book which costs a lot.
5,review,Book exactly as described and arrived in a very timely manner. Would do business with them again. Great experience!
2,No expansion,"This bag is just too small if you have to carry more than a very small laptop and perhaps a bit of paperwork. The pockets do not expand to accomodate gear or miscellaneous items of any substance. If you will are in need of space, this is not the bag for you. It would have been useful to have had the exact dimensions prior to purchase. I'll never buy another case without them."
5,The Doors of Perception Heaven and Hell,Love the book. The service of Amazon was great and the price of the product. I will be definetly be buying more things on Amazon.
2,Very Overrated Book,What you have here is Aldous Huxley describing his experiments with Mescaline and musing on psychedelics. Maybe its his background (he came from a high level British aristocratic family) but he just comes off in such a cold detached way in his thoughts on psychedelics being an enhancement of ones spiritual life. Not that I don't believe psychedelics can't be a spiritual enhancer or give one a deep glance into ones self or into other worlds but Huxley just does it in such a sterile heartless way I didn't get much out of this book. I loved Brave New World but this is a very overrated book.
4,plowed through it,"I love huxley's fictional work (Island is one of my all time fav books). These two are a bit tougher to read. He says some excellent things, and has a lot of wonderful insights into modern culture, but he writes so pretentiously. I can just picture him with a thesaurus trying to come up with the rarest and juiciest words he can find. Some pages have to be re-red several times over to get through his zany writing style (a single paragraph shouldnt span 3 pages!). These two are certainly worthwhile books for any intellectual philosopher, but one may first need to engage in some of the experiences he refers to before one can understand where he is coming from."
5,Exploration of the Mind at Large,"One of the most fundamental things to keep in mind when reading this work is that Huxley is no telling the general populous to go find the nearest meth dealer but rather to remain open to the possibilities of other perceptions. Additionally, this book explores the various perceptions of the mind asking the reader to be more open minded in his/her experiences."
5,Everyone should read it!,"I think it is on of the best books I have ever read, I would recomend it to everyone."
1,Not that Great,"I was disappointed with ""Doors of Perception."" I was expecting something insightful. Instead, this book was all theoretical with comparisons to art. I had no idea what Huxley's point was."
5,The Doors of Perception Open Forever!!!,This is a monumentous book that should be read by trippers and intellectuals alike. Huxley obviously has a intense mystical experience and this shows through his writing.
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Since this book was written, millions of people have taken...., mescaline, mushroooms, whatever. If you've never tried it, chances are you know somebody who has, and they could probably give you a far better story. Huxley's book is boring as hell. He goes on and on with endless descriptions of some work of art (which unless you are an art major, you've never seen) and is constantly referring to artist and people whom you've probably never heard of. Most the time, I had no idea what this guy was talking about. Maybe my drug addled brain just has a hard time with such high-falutin concepts such as 'Gesualdo's madrigals' . The rest is just a lot of big talk. Read it if you must. People will think your're hip and that's worth two stars I suppose."
2,The band is better than the book!,"Ok I bought the book to see what induced Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison to name their band ""The Doors"". After reading the hyper-intellectualized accounts of getting loaded and then viewing the world while under the influence, the book found a semi permanent lodging place under the edge of my bed. The music of the Doors still moves me and gets played every day I am in my shop. The book is an excellent read before bed because it quickly puts me to sleep. Reading this book 50 years after the fact is not like reading Michner or Camus or Sartre. Its is a stuffy read, dated, and as I discovered.... not like having a crystal ball to peer into the 60's minds of the Doors."
2,The doors of perception,This is a terrible book which I had mistakingly purchased from Amazon. Perhaps if you are high on something with a desire to waste time you may enjoy it.
4,Painful story but very helpful.,"When you grow up thinking youre the only one who had a crazy abusive mother who made you take care of them, you are very grateful for authors like this one. Fascinating book with some good insight."
3,The Mother I Carried,"The book was a little hard for me to follow, I had to read and re-read to understand. It took my a while to finish the book, but when I did, I was left with a feeling of validation. I thought I was the only person who had such a emotionally abusive mother and it was very cripling. After reading this book, I found out why I have had so many problems in my life and have began therapy. I saw so much of myself in this book and so much of my mother. This is a great book for anyone who feels alone in their emotions. It is well worth the time it took me to read the book. I would recommend this book for anyone who has ever been abused by someone they loved so much."
1,Bob Oschack is not worth your money,"This guy is a racist douchebag who actually thinks it's funny to denigrate an entire race of people. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on his lame, out-dated ""jokes"". - [...]"
5,An excellent generalist shoe.,"I found this to be extremely comfortable from the first wearing, pleasing both fashionably and ecologically. One buyer's comment regarding the sizing was helpful: I normally wear a size 8 U.S. and 39 EU., but these run roomy and I am comfortably wearing size 38. I will definitely order more."
5,Great cast of sidekicks,Wonderful sense of place--Wyoming in December. I didn't need to turn on the air conditioning while I was reading this book. Add the usual great cast of sidekicks and turns of phrase and this is a winner even though I'm beginning to wonder if Sheriff Longmire is getting shot and injured just a little too often.
5,Entertaining,"All I can say is that I discovered this writer while visiting in Red Lodge Montana and after reading his first book, went back and bought all of the rest!"
3,Not as exciting as TV series,"Death Without Company. was a good read but the TV series wasn't as dragged out as the plot was in the book,"
3,Second Tier Mysteries are Okay,"This series featuring Sheriff Walt Longmire has become, for me, something I read between higher rated books because there aren't enough of those to occupy my time. This is my second book, and it confirms what I think I learned from the first. The books are pretty well written, the characters are reasonably interesting and the plots are okay. There isn't the depth of character that you find in better books and I find that I'm not really relating to old Walt like I do to others like Harry Bosch, Dave Robicheaux, Kurt Wallander, etc. I'd compare him somewhat to Joe Pickett in the C.J. Box series, although Pickett might get the nod as the more interesting guy. But the book is worth reading and won't leave you screaming in frustration."
3,Justice Walt Longmire Style,"What is wrong with the idea of a sherrif dispensing justice?Well, I gues the same thing that is wrong with meth-crazed hitmen driving trailers down snow filled backroads, something has to give.Give is what you got. The story gives the Walt some space to comment upon how children in poor communites (vissible minority is often used as a code-word for a group of people that don't get much resources) are raised and the impact of that style of neglect has generation to generation.Still Walt has to learn to avoid punchups in the middle of snowy nights. If he keeps punching people's fist with his face he won't last long as a senior-citizen sherrif.djc"
5,Longmire puts a new twist on mystery!!!,Craig Johnson has made the tired old western a fresh new crime story. The Walt Longmire series provides a breath of fresh clean air and mystery in the telling of his very human crime investigations. Excellent read!!!
4,fine reading,the book is alot better than the TV show great characters well written just like your in wyoming a hard book to put down
3,Death without Company,I should have read the first book in this series. It was hard to get in to the swing of his writing - to follow his train of thought. The story was very intriguing so I kept reading because I really wanted to know what happened. I'm from Wyoming and love to read books that take place there. I can relate to the landscape and the harsh winters. I'm going to get the first book in the series and keep reading.
5,a page turner,This was a real page turner. I was amazed at the beating these men could take while doing the right thing and not stop until they solved the mystery and saved the day. I am also enjoying the tv series on A & E and enjoy picturing Robert Taylor and Lou Diamond Phillips as I read this series. Understand?
3,Good in Every Respect But....,"...But I found this book nevertheless to be slow and boring. I don't know what it is. The characters are interesting and well-developed. The plot was a little complicated, but good. The writing was deft, almost lyrical at times. Humorous in a few spots, also. But, for me, it just didn't catch fire. Things moved too slowly. I found Johnson's writing style a little affected. Although I enjoyed the book, it wasn't by much. Though his second book, it's my first. I'll try the other book, but all things considered, I'm just gonna give this one three stars. I prefer C.J. Box, when it comes to writing about Wyoming."
4,Death without Company,"A very good mystery writer - however, CJ Box is at the top of my family's list for western writing about WY.."
4,Death without Company,I loved this book and will be reading the rest of the Walt Longmire Mysteries. A great TV series as well.
4,Fun Read,I became hooked by watching the new series on TV that is based on these books. I am now on my third book in the series. The book has wonderful character development and I love the setting. If you want a wonderful book that is fun to read with interesting characters and set in Wyoming this is the book for you.
5,Longmire Fan,"Another great read by Craig Johnson. Stories keep you attention, characters are fun.You like Longmire, Vic, and Henry Standing Bear more with each read. Very enjoyable"
5,Excellent - Where you need it message board,"This message board was just the right size for getting the info at the point of contact with employees , light weight and portability are a plus"
4,Exactly what I'd hoped for,I purchased three of these message boards and am very pleased with their quality and functionality. They are exactly as advertised. The only thing that would make them better is a clip of some sort to hold a dry erase marker. Will no doubt purchase this item again.
5,Beginning Apologetics,"Book in Great condition (new), cheap. Shiped promptly. I will definitively buy again from this seller."
2,Not Very Moisturizing,"This product smells great, but it's a little too strong on the fruity side. I bought it because I have sensitive skin, which suddenly seemed to get very dry in the t-zone, and the reviews of this cream indicated it worked well for dry, sensitive skin. However, after putting it on in the morning, then applying my makeup, the skin on my nose and surrounding area and forehead were still dry, and you could see the flaking skin. I have since found other web sites which have products without parabens and other skin irritants, and they state that using products with too many fruit acids is hard on sensitive skin. If I had known that, I would never have purchased this product. Wish I could get my money back as I was only able to use it a couple of times!"
5,Great product,Love the way this makes my face feel! I highly recommend it for anyone with combination skin. Definitely a great face cream!
3,Its okay,Its a good product but it just isnt for me. It makes me feel oily after i put it on and the essential oils in it over power my nose and my face.
2,good smell but irritating,has a nice smell but leaves my face irritated. dont recommend for sensitive skin. i'd recommend more natural brands for less money.
4,Moisturizer,"I have used this product for several years and periodically try other similiar moisturizers, I really find that Yonka Products work as well as products that cost 3 or 4 times more. Travels well but needs to be used within the expiration time recommended."
5,"Walk a straight line long enough, you end up where you were","I'm not too sure what to say about this album except that it's one of the best I've heard. I got into this album first and bought Lonesome Crowded West later, but there is an interesting progression between these two CDs. This is definately a more polished album, but that doesn't make it any less wierd and exciting. The music is probably what will strike you first about this album, but the lyrics hit later and make it even more fun. Songs like ""Wild Pack of Family Dogs"" and ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" are instantly fun, but some of the more subtle lyrics are even better. If you want to check out this band and are looking for a more indie sound, buy Lonesome Crowded West. If you heard the atmospheric textures of ""Gravity Rides Everything "" on that van commercial (I was as surprised as most fans probably were), and want more, buy this album."
4,Music for an Ocean Voyage,"Modest Mouse has been surprising people and pissing people off since the release of their first full-length ""This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About"" in 1997. Since then, they have done everything from pay homage to the 1950s (with Sleepwalking off the ""Interstate 8"" EP on Up Records) to rap (with ""The Fruit That Ate Itself"" EP on K Records). With The Moon & Antarctica, they go farther. This time, with the help of some members of Califone and The Loftus, they surprise us all by getting earthy, dark, and moody with songs like ""Alone Down There"" and ""The Cold Part."" But they still put up a fight with songs like ""I Came as a Rat"" and ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes."" This disc is awesome. It seems to span time and the distance between up and down."
5,"wow, they're awesome","Holy cow they are so good. I heard about them from my cousins. They said that they are so good. I took their word for it, so I went out and bought Moon and Antarctica and The Fruit That Ate Itself.My favorite thing about them has got to be Isaac's voice. How could you not like it?! He always sounds drunk and I love it. One thing that they need to do is to re-record all of their songs on Sony/Epic records. now that would be sweetI highly recomend that you go out and buy as many CDs as possible. They are all-around just frikin good.I LOVE THIS BAND"
4,The Moon and Antarctica,"This is the last major LP these guys released. It was also their major label debut. You might expect them to sell-out and make a more user-friendly album. Instead they made a record even less accessible than their past efforts. Its an excellent record but its not perfect. There is at least one complete throw-away which is Tiny Cities made of ashes. That song sort of blows. The rat one isnt really great either. There are some moments of near brilliance on this album. ""Gravity rides everything"" and ""lives"" are two of the best songs they ever wrote. Modest Mouse has potential to become one of the best bands in the world."
4,a more mature mouse,"no....the major label debuet hasnt changed the crew. the songs dont sound exactly the same as some of their other stuff, but modest mouse is still there. the sound is much more mature and the song writing is as good as ever."
5,"I'm not only a member, I'm also a client.","Though I got Good News for People Who Love Bad News first, I hurriedly bought The Moon & Antarctica, onsale and became a Modest Mouse fan forever. It wasn't that Good News... was bad, just that its not as good as Moon and Antarctica. Every song is a little adventure and similar enough that you would know its Modest Mouse but so far off it creates an esoteric, brilliant and meandering group of amazing songs. I would recommend all MM CDs but I think this is the second best, after Lonesome Crowded West. It certainly deserves to be in every collection. Faves- #1. Life Like Weeds! Tiny Cities Made of Ashes..I Came as a Rat...Different City...3rd Planet..unbelievably, great music."
4,The big label,"Every other Modest Mouse CD is, literally, life-changing. The guys are just that good. This one, though, is just very, very good. It's like their Cymbeline or something - still the Shake, but not Romeo and Juliet. ""Wild Pack of Family Dogs,"" ""Stars are Projectors"" are probably the standout tracks. Modest Mouse lyrics always stay with you, and these songs are no different."
5,can't live w/o M&A,Once I finally listened to M&A I wondered how I lived w/o it. Every note and sound is perfectly placed. There's some songs I listen to more but really should be enjoyed from beginning to end as it was intended to be experienced.
4,Cool Schtuff,"I'm not even going to try to be a Modest Mouse poser and say this is their best album. I've only been into Modest Mouse for three years, at most. This is, however, the first MM CD I bothered buying. Before, I would just d-load their music. 3rd Planet, has been for years, and probably ever will be, my favorite MM tune. The rest of the CD is rather spacey, but still enticing nonetheless. It's like, once you turn it on, you can't turn it off. The four extra tracks are sort of a waste; who the heck wants a radio edit of a cool song? Custom Concern is a nice touch, however. Not the best MM stuff, but if you are getting into MM, this is a good album to get into them on; it's the bridge between Good News For People Who Love Bad News and Lonesome Crowded West. See which direction you'd rather go in. The Moon & Antarctica is a great CD and definitely recommended for all Modest Mouse fans."
1,Glut of Mediocrity,"After suffering through the first listen to this CD and forcing myself to listen to it another half dozen times, I can only give my honest opinion that these guys suck. Annoying and idiotic, kind've reminding me of my girlfriend when I was in 8th grade (whining, flat, and stupid), ripping off the Pixies to some extent (and not in a very good way at that...i.e. the Pixies made good songs), and underwhelmingly pretentious. Nothing has made me feel this queasy since being force fed Barbara Streisand at a formulative age. Learn from my mistake -- save your money and use it for something worthwhile..."
1,Forget Lo-Fi...GO HI-FI,"I don't know what the deal is with this Lo-Fi phenomena. Back when I was in high school I was exposed to, and forever linked with, HI-FI! Bands like My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Chapterhouse, Slowdive. The ultimate in studio production....HI-FI. Not pop. No Trio's. They all sounded different. But here with these lo-fi bands like Built to Spill, Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie, sure the tunes are catchy but they are empty and leave no emotions to go with the memory of the music. You youngsters have a genre here but its not new. Its not ground breaking and its rather boring. I'm glad I was a high schooler in the early 90's and have my Hi-Fi memories..."
3,Jump to the majors....,"I was hoping modest mouse would defy tradition and make a major label album that meets the standards of their indie heritage, but apparently that never happens.This album isnt horrible, its still better than 90% of what you find on the MTV, but it lacks the tonal sincerity that their previous albums have... and it just doesnt make me feel as good."
5,"After listening to it over 20 times, I realize this is the best album ever! 2nd place goes to 40oz To Freedom","The dark center of the universe is easily the best song ever written, easily. The music, the emotion, and the lyrics are pure perfection. Read the lyrics while listening to the song and you will realize what I am talking about. It is poetry, so I won't tell you what it all means, but if you listen to it enough it will hit you. If you can't see the thin air then why the hell should you care?"
3,"Modest Mouse's Worst, But Still Good.","While TMAA pales in comparison to the Lonesome Crowded West, compared to most other music around today, it's great. But it still lacks the twisted hooks and organic feel of The Lonesome Crowded West and Long Drive. Sure, they can do a lot more with the big budget, but they almost completely threw away the natural feel and lo-fi minimalism that was one of the pluses in their previous works. If you want to get acquainted with Modest Mouse, pick up Lonesome Crowded West before this."
3,what happens when you take music too seriously,"in all honesty, i was not really impressed with this album, although i am slowly warming up to it. i always loved the informality of the earlier modest mouse album's, and the major label production thing that they are doing now, although better for their pocketbooks (because it gives more catchy little hooks), is not great for their fans. i really hope that they move back toward their old stuff and concentrate less on having a polished sound, but i fear that they will continue in the same trend as this album. maybe i just haven't given it enought time yet, but i would reccomend that you buy any of their earlier albums before purchaing this one. even thought i whine about this album like a little child, it still goes into my cd player quite often, so i would reccomend that the reader assume that my standards have been set altogether too high by the other modest mouse albums i own and that this really is a good album."
4,The Joys Of Mouse,"Moon & Antarctica.one of the best modest mouse cd's. actually is the cd that got me into the band MM. at the time finding modest mouse in Florida was an impossible feat. recently i traveled to New York to visit a best friend, and partly to fulfill my craving for MM. Now have 8 Modest Mouse cds, including the new one Good News for People Who Love Bad News. I have to say its a must buy, as with everything this band puts out. no matter the occasion MM shows up and makes ya smile. much love"
5,The feather in Brock's already impressive cap,"Despite the fact that Brock has proved time and time again to be a huge jerk, his music continues to impress me. The band is among my favorites, and The Moon and Antartica is undoubtedly thier masterpiece. Cobbling together happiness, depression, anger, despair, paranoia, and god only knows how many drugs they have created a powerful and moving piece of art.The deep and almost trippy opening song paves the way for what can only be described as an emotional roller coaster, ranging from the happy, almost folksy Paper Thin walls to the furious screams of What People are Made Of to the Weird as Hellness of Tiny Cities Made of Ashes. The album is both the apex and the best starting point for Modest Mouse."
2,DISAPPOINTED- WHERE is the RAW GUITAR flesh of earlier work?,"Listening to this I can only think of the commiercialization the polished crap that gets washed into our ears today. It happened to Blink, Green Day, and poor old Black Francis- It frightens me to hear the same thing happening to MM. I am a hardcore fan and it is very hard for me to understand why the band that so triumphantly screeched REPENT! in Beach front property could be the same band who sumbles and plays slowly on acoustic hymns of muddled euphony. SUre that was a dimension fo their work before, but never such a prevalant force. THe punch has been taken out. The it's sad but I really hope that this mouse will not remain neutered."
4,Patti and Selma will love it,"Okay, you'll have to be a Simpsons fane to get the reference.First thing to know, they say this DVD is Region 1, but I am in Region 4 and it played perfectly on my el cheapo DVD player.Of the two movies on this DVD, Lost Treasure is by far the superior one. In fact it was surprising good - all classic MacGyver withan homage to Raiders of the Lost Ark.Trail to Doomsday is really only for the MacGyver fans, and even then.....well the less said the better.Glad to have finally seen these movies."
3,A must for MacGyver fans,"This dvd was done after the series ended. It has a different feel to it and both movies are based in London (what was with that). There is no reference to The Phoenix Foundation or his past life.I was a little disappointed with the movies, although seeing RDA in action is always great. Still any fan would want it as part of the collection."
4,Great Movie,This was bought to give as a gift for a 13 year old.He loves it and wanted movies like this.
4,MacGyver TV Movies,I remember seeing the Treasure of Atlantis on TV in Australia and it intrigued me. I was pleased to find it released on DVD - finally. I thought that the set was quite well produced but had a quaint perhaps early teenager presentation about them. There wasn't the drama that I have associated with the Indiana Jones movies. I am not sure if people would like this approach.The MacGyver TV series were also interesting but I have not gone to the expense of buying them - yet.
4,Review,If you are a MacGyer fan it was good and I am. Not the one I am still looking for. Had beings from Space. Think it may be the last episode. Don't know. Will conmtinue to look and purchase. But these will stay in my movie archives to view often.
4,I was surprised!,"I won't call myself a hip hop fan but I listened to a copy of this cd from a friend of mine and I was impressed. The lyrics alone were very deep, thought provoking and positive. He addresses some interesting topics from a perspective that scares most artists. Braille samples from some popular beats -- so the music is tight too! Appropriate for all ages."
4,Simple yet a tool of survival,"In my experience traveling and living in China for two years, having arrived in the country with this dictionary and no prior experience in the language, I have become competent in Mandarin with the great help of this little 'friend'.Although certainly not concise, it is missing a great deal of (usually) less practical words, it is small enough to carry in your pocket as you wander the streets trying to self-study or translate. It explains grammatical terms with amazing clarity in a tone that an amateur in language studies can understand. Often if will give 4 definitions for a word, but will explain the application of each definition. Moreover, it will give example sentences to help with grammatical and further vocabulary retention. It also uses both PINYIN and Characters in the Chinese definitions.Basically it is a huge communicative aid and learning tool but should accompany another source to fill in the vocabulary blanks."
2,Shedded feathers everywhere,The white boa looked OK but it shed feathers everywhere. I had to use a lint remover on all the clothes and vacuum the place.
4,Paragon Review,"Product arrived safe and secure. Clubs were in good shape, triple wrapped. My son and I went to the range that night and started hitting balls. He's eight and took a little while to get used to them. Overall, excellent. Irons and wedges are easy to hit and get the balls airborne. Driver and 3-wood have taken a lot of practice for him to hit as well as his smaller clubs. However, that's practice! They should last until he's 10--11 yr old."
2,not as portable as one would think,"While this seemed like a great idea, this module did not work as promised. It was not removable and portable as the ad claims. I removed it once to allow a peer to try it in her handspring and when I tried to put it back, it no longer would work, and I lost all the files I had placed on it. Also, it now only says it has 2MB of memory, and can't hold much of anything worthwhile. My advice - if you need 16MB, then purchase a new PDA, that's what I'm going to end up doing. This module isn't worth the hassle."
