1,A Real Piece of Junk,"Purchased brand new, mine crapped out on me after a grand total of three uses. Made predominantly from cheap plastic. The cords are unwieldy, no one thought about practical utility. In my opinion this product should not bear the name of a U.S. company."
4,Versatile,This is my second inflator but I like this one the best because it can be used while on the road and at home plugged-in to electrical outlet.
1,Bad Purchase,"This product worked a total of FIVE SECONDS and that was it! Just the motor ran, did not produce ANY air. Returned for refund!"
4,B & D Portable air pump,I purchased this mainly to inflate rafts and pool toys and it works fine. The only complaint is that it has a VERY short power cord so an extension cord is definitely needed.
3,works well when it works,The compressor is handy and workse reasonably well but is not reliable. I expected a longer life from Black and Decker.
1,"Piece of junk. Worked 5-10 times, then broke","I had the Airstation for about two couple years, but I only used it 5-10 times. It has now stopped working on AC power, and it puts out less air than it used to on DC power. This product will only frustrate you when you need it."
3,"Works, But With Limitations","This air pump does a good job of inflating tires and other inflatables with two limitations. First, it's nice that everything fits within the hose compartment so it is easy to transport, but the extremely short AC power cord (1 ft) means you'll be dragging around an extension cord whenever you use it. Even a thin 6 ft cord would've eliminated this problem. Secondly, the valve adapter is hard to get on and off a tire stem. In taking it off, after I release the locking lever on the adapter, I have to really pull on it to get it to release. I end up almost pulling the valve stem out of the tire, and in the process release some of the air I just pumped in. If this is how it works new, I hate to think what it will be like after a lot of use. Other than that it seems to meet all my needs."
2,It is great when it works.,"I have been using this little compressor for over two years and loved it. I say loved, past tense, because it suddenly would not power up on AC or DC and after reading, calling, emailing, checking.....it does not have a serviceable fuse. Such a small thing, but obviously planned obsolescence. Maybe B&D doesn't want you to be able to keep it going long enough to wear out. I was very disappointed, because I really liked many of the features that people have mentioned and if I had reviewed this 3 days ago I would have given it 4 or 5 stars! If you want something to last more than two years, this is not the unit to buy."
2,20 year old Sears air station far better,"to fill an auto tire, set the desired PSI to the highest setting possible then disconnect when reached if you are lucky. anything lower and the pump shuts off almost immediately."
2,Won't last,Considering its not something used every day it should have lasted longer.stopped working today. 2 years 10 months. I used it about once a month.I will be conservative and say It was used 50 times max. It worked ok. A little slow and noisy. Gauge is hard to read. All in all I wouldn't suggest this unit.
4,No complaints,Has done the job so far. I have used it maybe 10 times so far and it worked well each time. Handy machine
4,Very helpful Air Station,"Very practical and useful, it even fits the car for a long trip, 110V very important and the tools that bring are very helpful, I recommend one per home!!!"
3,Replaced after only 8 Months,This unit failed after only 8 months of light usage. No abuse. The motor refused to turn on. Had to ship it to Black & Decker service center where a replacement was shipped back within a week.
2,Not built to last,"Worked great the first 3 times- died on the 4th. Basically, this is a toy and nothing more. Black & Decker has gone down hill in recent years and this a perfect example ."
1,Stopped working after 10 Minutes,"I was using it to inflate snow tubes for sledding. It inflated the first one fine. On the second one it was difficult to get the inflator hose end piece inserted properly into the snow tube valve. Tried running it, but it kicked off immediately. Tried several times to restart it. I called Black and Decker and they said to either return it to Home Deport or take it to a service center. I was hoping they could be more helpful than that."
2,I sent mine back,"I purchased this to fill my boat trailer tires and my Deere garden tractor tires. No such luck. This unit does not have the strength to fill these tires even though it states it's good for tires. It did work well on some smaller 15 psi tires I have, but anything over that, I wish you luck. Bottomline, I have not been able to find the right machine for my needs, looks like I will go ahead and just spend the hundreds of $$$ for a full scale air compressor. Amazon was a no hassle return, so that was nice."
4,"Functional, but slow",Had it for a few months and it certainly beats using my lungs. Two gripes. It takes a long time to blow up anything medium to large. Swiss ball took about 10-15 mins to inflate. Second problem is the power cord to the unit is very short. Think about as long as a twizzler. Still functional though so gets a 4.
2,Bizarro Design Choices,"Who designed this thing, the government? Hard to imagine why they placed the on-off switch to sit deep in a cavity buried by the long DC power cord. Or why they designed the air tube and AC power cord to be only a foot long each, thus extremely limiting its usefulness. Also, why put the adapters on the bottom?It functions well, the auto-shutoff feature works, but it is a pain to use in general and lowers the amount of joy in the world."
2,"Smoke pours out, unit is dead","I have had this unit for a few years and used it for filling up basketballs and some tires. Airing up my truck tires to 80 psi from about 25 psi is an all-day job. This unit is not designed for that level of air pushing. And today I fried it by running for about 15 minutes to pressurize some plumbing for a test. It didn't make it to 100 psi before smoke started billowing out and the unit quit. These machines should have thermal switches which cut off the machine before it kills itself. If all you're ever going to do is fill bike tires and balls, this is fine. For anything more, you need something bigger."
1,Don't buy this,I purchased one of these several months ago and have probably used it 5 times. After the 5th time it stopped working. The problem from what I have been able to discern is a blown fuse that is soldered inside the unit. If you Google this product you will see that this is a very common issue and many owners have experienced the same issue some repeatedly. Since I can't use this anymore to fill up tires I am going to use it to fill up the inside of my trash can.
1,Not worth the money,"I used this unit two times before it stopped working. The unit would light up as if it was functional, but not pump air. I adjusted the pressure sensor all the way o the right (highest setting). I tried turning the unit off/on and got the same results. I unplugged the unit thinking it would reset the pressure sensor, but when powered on the needle showed at 0 while the pressure sensor was at at the max 160psi. I had read reviews that the AC side would blow a fuse, so I tried the DC power, same results, gauge lit up and showed the needle at 0 and the pressure sensor at 160. you would think for $50 the unit would last more than a couple of days."
1,Worked for 15 seconds!,The product worked for ~15 seconds then died. It could have been a lemon but that'd speak to poor B&D; quality control if so.In re Amazon's return policy - 5 stars! Incredible.
1,Wasted money!,"On the third use, the plastic piece that locks on the tire valve stem broke off, rendering this purchase completely useless. I'll definitely be contacting Black & Decker for a refund. It's a shame, because otherwise this product would rate five stars."
2,poorly designed,"The cables are too short and the power switch is inside! Not worth returning, but certainly not easy to use"
5,Awesome product,"Overall an excellent product. I've used this air station for about 3 years, with no problems whatsoever. Sure the cords are short, but that's the point. I love the compact nature of the product. It does a great job pumping up bike and car tires. Car tires take a few minutes, but who cares? I would recommend to anyone!"
1,A 50/50 Proposition,"I purchased my first Black-n-Decker air station in 2009. It worked well for about one year and then it would not work on AC power, but continued to work on DC for another year before completely giving up. Bought another B-n-D air station several months ago as a replacement for airing bicycle and golf cart tires. Since purchasing, I have used it twice for airing up bicycle tires... and now it will not work on AC or DC. I will attempt to return the unit and get a refund if possible.. I would consider a different AC/DC compressor if you want reliability."
2,Broke First Use,"Worked well on one tire on household current. Stopped on second tire, and that function hasn't worked since. Worked on one tire off of the car battery. I'm expecting it to break on the second. Unfortunately paperwork was thrown out. Obviously a common problem, and a cheap product. Would NOT recommend."
3,A little disappointed,"I was led to believe this unit had a rechargeable battery in it. For such a small unit, the idea is to be able to take it and use it where ever you go. A real pain if you have to always plug it in. Otherwise the unit works fine."
1,pure junk,"This inflator is worthless. It makes a lot of noise, has short cords and tubes, and can hardly inflate. You can pump a basketball with it, but don't try it on anything bigger (like a boat or a tire) unless you have the day to spare because that's how much time it'll take it.Piece of junk, don't waste your money."
4,Not as noisy as some say...,"We purchased this and have actually used it only once - not for car tire inflation, but to inflate an inflatable cushion. It worked great. I had expected a lot of noise based on some reviews, but it was not bad at all. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 (and not a 5) is because we haven't tried it on tires yet."
2,Takes too long!,"I also bought this at Lowe's and not Amazon. I wish I would have read the reviews on here before purchasing as I would have saved myself some money.I bought this station primarily for inflating air mattresses when camping. The AC/DC choice was perfect. Unfortunately it takes about 20 mins to blow up a standard size mattress.As others have mentioned, the device is very loud. Having to listen to that thing for 20mins minimum in a camp ground or house is taxing on the nerves. If your use is for air mattress, then I suggest getting the battery operated ones that are sold in the camping gear section.If you are only doing bike tires, it's tolerable. Slow, but tolerable."
3,"First one died, hose is too short, could be better.","I got one of these for christmas, and it completely died after only a few uses. It was out of warranty so I bought another (had a gift card and I like its portability). The second one has not died on me yet, but it could use some improvements. The air hose could be a little longer. Sometimes it is hard to get the valve on and off. This little thing is pretty loud, and if you have a flat car tire, be prepared to wait a long time. I am going to buy a real air compressor for the garage and use this one for trips and small jobs."
4,Black & Decker ASI1300 Air Station Inflator,I am very pleased with this product. It is not that noisy as some people have claimed.
4,Nice little air pump,"Yes, it is slow but I don't mind because it stops by itself so I don't need to monitor it. Also, I should not compare it with the expensive air pump at the gas station. This unit is perfect for maintaining car tires at the best PSI. Now I don't need to drive around to look for air station and find coins for it. But if I have a very flat tire, I would find a air station. I am worry that it may overheat if I let it pump for a flat tire. AC and DC connections are nice too. I only used it a few times so I can't give it 5 stars yet. So far it is great."
3,"mr bill rein, endorses the black & decker portable air station","I was very pleased with this Black & Decker air station. Mainly, because of its convient mobility and of course it works well. Yours truly, Bill R."
4,Donald Griffin,This has been a good item. I am glad I purchased it. The only thing I do not like is the fact the plug in is not longer.
4,very haapy but too soon to tell all,"This inflator is just what we wanted. It is small and handy. Can plug into car cigarette lighter or a regular socket, which is how we use it most. We needed it for wheel barrel and small tractor tires and it seems just right. Seems well made. I would give it a 5, but we have not had it long and do not know how it wll last."
3,bad location for power switch,"i use AC plug to inflate my tires in the garage, which are stored in the top compartment, and the power switch is inside the compartment where the DC cable is, you have to pull the DC cable out so you can reach the power switch, not convenient at all, wish they have installed the power switch somewhere else."
4,Portible Air Compresser,It maybe a little slow but does a very good job of filling up ties on a car and I like the fact that is parity compact.
3,Good aroung home inflator,AS1300 is a good buy for the price and is satisfactory for around the house usage. I use it for pumping up wheelbarrow and bicycle tires primarily. Also use it for pumping auto tires to 35 lbs which takes a few minutes. The negatives are pretty much what I have read from other reviewers: the air hose too short and the inflator is really noisy.
3,So Far Good,I've only had this inflator for a month and used a couple of times inflating vehicle tire. So far no problems. I really like the auto air pressure setting feature. The only con I have is storage of the DC cord. It makes it troublesome to reach the on/off button.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE !!,this product has been a lifesaver for my working around the yard. I bought a second one for my son
2,very poor design,"obviously the designer of this inflator never tried to use it. the power cord is far to short, the inflator hose is far to short. then to really show the idioticy, the off/on switch is buried beneath the 12 volt power cord on the back side of the unit."
4,B&D Inflator,"Here is my experience with this product:-Highly inaccurate pressure gauge...off by at least 10 PSI. I had to over inflate and later measure with a different more accurate gauge and adjust as needed.-Power extension cord requiredOverall, this is a good product for the price."
1,nozzle for car tire,This product does not contain a device for fitting into a car tire. The product I bought is not shown on the drop-down listing.
3,Basic inflator,"I bought this inflator after my first one made by Coleman ""burned up"" during use.The design of this inflator is good and I have no complaints except for the fact that the built in PSI gauge is useless. It is very inaccurate but this is easily rectified by having a separate PSI gauge. Rather inconvenient but not a dealbreaker. It has held up through moderate use thus far."
2,Not worth the money,I needed an air compressor to fill up the tires on my motorcycle and on my car. Ask yourself what you need it for.I can tell you that for my needs I could do just as well with a $15 12v air compressor (the ones that plug into the cigarette lighter of your car). I purchased one of those after returning this Black and Decker item. And I can take a tire from 15 psi to 35 psi in under 5 minutes with the $15 12v air compressor.So for this item which costs over 50 dollars for me it was major overkill. That being said the one that Amazon sent me was also defective and refused to power on after I finished one tire.But regardless of that I can tell you that for most home consumers this thing is overkill and it really is loud as hell. I mean obnoxiously loud. I mean loud enough to anger your neighbors loud. Its TOO LOUD!
2,Great until it broke.......,"The cord is very very short, that is true, but I was able to overlook it and its slow pumping... However after using it about 10 times, the pump broke. Unfortunately, have had it too long for warranty, just hadn't utilized it very often. What a waste of money."
2,Not my best decision,"Noisy, slow, awkward, hard to disconnect from tire, impossible to re-store the hose and DC cord once you take them out. Should have believed the other reviews..."
2,ok air inflater,"The inflator I got only last me less then 2 month with 3 use on my kid's bike and it went dead on me. I call the warrenty center, gladly they replace it right of way. Not sure if the replacement will go dean in 3 use again or less then 2 month."
4,Works as advertised.,Works just as it is described on the box. I'm quite happy with the product and have had no issue with it as yet.
4,Gets the job done,Other than needing a longer AC cord it really works great. It wasn't as loud as I was expecting from reading other reviews. Black and Decker scored one on this product
1,Wow! This thing's going back,"I agree with most of the positive reviews of this product: relatively quiet, easy to use and I like the auto-off feature. The one big drawback is that the clamp at the end of the air hose is made from 100% plastic. I tried multiple times to inflate two tires on two different cars with different tire brands and I could not get the clamp to release from the tire stem without pulling with all my might. I lost probably 3-4 pounds PSI each time I tried to release the clamp and worried I would damage the tire stem each time. I'll go to the gas station before I use this pump. I'm sending it back."
1,Not as good as Air Stations in past,"I got this product because I liked the Air Station I had in the past. The compressor seems fine for normal tasks. The auto off feature is nice, but not a need to have. The power cord is literally a foot or two long. You have to have an extension cord to use it! The DC power cord is 12 feet long. I just don't get that... I'd not buy this product again."
2,air station inflator,I would like to have known that the inflator cord was so short.For me it was difficult for inflating my car tires.Unit will shut off near desired pressure but you have to keep adding more air.I bought a black and decker air inflator 25 years ago and it ran circles around this one.
1,Blows fuses constantly,"The Black and Decker Airstation has been useless to me. My first time using it, after less than a minute of pumping, the unit refused to work. It would simply not run. Come to find out that it had blown an internal fuse. This fuse is not even socketed, so it is a pain to replace. After replacing, the next time I used it, it again blew a fuse. This was not a high pressure or strenuous inflation job. I never went above 40 PSI (unit says it can do 160), and never more than 60 seconds of running time. Totally worthless - buy something else."
3,Mr. Patel,Very good Product.However I will suggest to improve in longer electrical cord.Auto air dial is a very good feature.Price & potability are a plus. I will recommend to everybody.
3,advantages/disadvantages of B&D inflator,"Advantages:Dual power operation 120Volt A.C.(wall) or 12Volt D.C.(Car).Very QUIET almost no vibration and illuminated gauge.Disadvantages:Analog gauge not accurate,hard to preset dial( built ontop of gauge),inconsistent tire pressure within 3 to 5 PSI.Dial has no locking mechanism so maybe it should be tapedto the body once set to approximate pressure generated.Digital gauge is much better.Chuck is plastic so is the body.Air hose as well as 120Volt power cord too short(designedto fit inside the unit for compactness)."
1,Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator,I purchased this black and Decker air pump based on my last pump by Black and Decker. This pump was a big disappointment. The Air hose is very short and AC cord is even shorter. My last pump hat a 3-foot air hose and 6 foot Line cord and lasted 25 years. It would pump up my truck tire in 5 to 10 minutes.This pump takes 45 minutes to put 8 lbs of air in my truck tire. The air valve is too small to easily attach to tire valves. Tractor tire is very difficult to air up because of the short air line.Over all I rate this pump as very poor. I suggest do not purchase this model.
2,Black and Decker Air station inflator,I bought this product mainly to keep air pressure in our vehicles--doesn't do the job very well--takes a long time and still not sufficient inflation on my truck. Does footballs/basketballs/bike tires ok.
1,Mine broke after second use,"Before you order this pump online, check to see how far away you are from a B&D service center. Mine developed a fast internal leak that let more air out than it ever put in. Now, to be fair, B&D will replace the pump with a brand new one and I'm satisfied with that. But that's only because I live 20 minutes away from an authorized service center. Many people live much further away. Use B&D's service center locater on their website to find out how far YOU are away from your service center because if you have to drive far or ship the pump that time and $$ will cost you."
2,Worked for a while,"I purchased the Black and Decker Air Station in July 2010. I read many of the reviews and anticipated I could live with some of the issues stated previously by other owners. I specifically wanted an AC inflator and this was a similar unit that I had for about 5 years (Black and Decker also). I received the inflator and it worked well and up to my expectations until about 2 weeks ago, when the inflator stopped working. There were other reviewers also stating premature failure, but thought it was worth a shot. It was a decent inflator but reliability appears to be a real problem when life expectancy is about 5 months."
2,disappointed,"when I first got this it worked good, when it was a little over a year old (about a dozen uses) the fuse in the unit blew and it quit working. I thought that was a expensive unit for about a dozen uses."
2,Poor design,"The AC power cord and the air hose are both very short making the use complicated and almost always requiring an extension power cord. Furthermore, the car power cord is connected to and must be stored right next to the on/off button. As a result, you must deal with that car power cord every time you use the pump, even if not connected to the car power."
2,Don't Buy This Item,I purchased the Black & Decker AS1300 air compressor. The built in gauge didn't work. It was about 20 pounds off. I called Black &Decker and was told the gauge on this model was not accurate and to purchase the model ASI500 with a digital gauge. Black & Decker is selling a model that they are aware the gauge doesn't work. Do yourself a favor. Shop around and buy another model.air
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I recently purchased this Black and Decker Air Station to keep a car tire with a slow leak properly inflated until I can get the tire fixed. After reading some of the other reviews I was skeptical about how well the Air Station would work.Today I tried the Air Station for the first time and I couldn't be happier with the product. I set the air pressure for 30lbs., attached the hose to the tire, and turned on the machine. In just a few minutes the machine shut off automatically. I checked the tire's air pressure and it was exactly at 30lbs. It couldn't have been easier.Sure it was a little loud, and the cords are short requiring you to use an extension cord, and the air pressure setting was difficult to set precisely. But these were minor inconveniences. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it did the job."
2,Black & Decker Air Station not so good,"I bought this being a fan of past Black & Decker products. They typically have very nice features and overall clean designs. This was no different so I bought it. It worked initially but after about a months use it died. I ended up returning it. First time I had issue with a new product from B&D. I then bought a differnt model AS1500 from Black & Decker which is not quite as intuitive to operate, but does work and works well. I would recommend that model instead of this one."
2,Works only for about 2 years.,"I originally bought this product about 4 years ago and I just finished go through a 2nd one. The first one I bought stopped working when my friend borrowed it and he kindly bought me another one. But, this second one stopped working on the sametime as the first one. I don't know what caused this. I use it occasionally and it was great and fast, but I have to look for another one now!Update 10/22/12- I was on the second one after my first one did not work and my friend got me another one. However, this second one just died this year. So, I had one from my original purchase in 2008 and then this second one from 2010 to this year. I am definitely not happy with the quality control of Black & Decker air compressor."
1,not even good for light use,"I read the reviews and decided for the price I would give it a shot. I'm a single mom who often has flat bike tires, inflatable toys and the occasional flat tire before work to deal with. I thought this would be perfect for the limited use I needed from it. I used it one day, heard a loud pop and it doesn't work anymore. I can only assume that it was a blown fuse as mentioned in other reviews. I'm not going to waste my time taking it apart to see if I can fix it myself(which I'm not above doing). Thank goodness for Amazon and their return policy. It's going back today and I'm going to start looking for a small air compressor instead, I'd advise anyone looking at this product to do the same."
1,Cheap and broke,"Don't buy this item. I cannot even contact the seller that changed names. Within a month it just broke. Cheap plastic, waste of money. Buy something other than plastic."
2,Just Doesn't Last,"We've owned two of these now and, while they work well at first, both failed in less than a year of moderate use (blowing up pool toys, topping off normal-size car and bike tires). They still make noise (LOTS of noise), but don't inflate. Home Depot replaced it for us the first time, and we'd hoped we just had a dud, but the second unit suffered the same fate, in about the same amount of time.I don't think we mis-used it at all. Probably brought it out every 2-3 weeks on average ... meaning it died in approximately 12-15 uses. Unfortunately, I just don't think it's well made or at all durable.Like others I see here, the failure point for our unit, both times, was the fuse, which is soldered to the unit and can NOT be replaced, which seems silly to the extreme.It's compact, easy to use and when it works, it works well. The bad part is that it just doesn't work for long."
3,"Does a good job, wish it was faster and less noisy.","Purchased this item for my minivan. It took about 10 minutes to go from 20PSI to 35PSI. While it was busy working, it made a lot of noise. The 120-volt cord I found to be very short, I guess it's because ""Black and Decker"" assumes you'll use an extension if you have to use it. The 12-volt cord is very long so it is possible to use it even on vans. Overall, this is a good product and I recommend it."
4,Handy,"Good:Handy for all inflation jobs - motorcycles, cars, bikes, basketballs, air mattresses, swimming pool. The automatic psi gauge is helpful to get the motorcycle tires to the correct pressure.Bad:Location of the power switch is in an awkward place. Would have given it 5 stars had it not been for that."
4,Sturdy and inexpensive peace of mind! Only issue is accuracy of pressure gauge.,"This model is great- is compact and light, and has both 12v and wall plug-in capability, which is rare. IS more than sufficient for any bike, motorcycle, inner tube or car applications. For the price it is hard to beat! I will say that the gauge is not terrifically accurate, but none are for these types of things- spring the extra $5 for a legit gauge and you'll be great!"
1,Junk!,"I ordered this and it was delivered on time and as stated. The original compressor lasted 3 months before failing on the AC input. It was replaced by B&D at no charge. The replacement compressor lasted 6 months and again the AC input failed. After talking with customer service at B&D, they requested the second one be returned and upon it's receipt a third replacement would be shipped at no charge. I was told by customer service the AC input circuit had been changed and would not fail as the first two had! The third compressor lasted 9 months before the AC input again failed. I have the original and the failed 3rd compressor that both work on DC power. The AC input failures all made a loud ""POP"" noise and never worked after this happened. None of these compressors were used for anything other than car tires, bikes and a wheel barrow. My original B&D Air Station lasted for over 10 years before it failed. This unit is made in China and I can't advise anyone to buy it."
2,Whoever designed this has a problem,"The power cord is ridiculously short, so the unit must be used with an extension cord unless you are just inflating a football on your workbench. Confusing and inconveniently placed switches. Unit has a tendency to shut off or blow fuses if You connect and push buttons in the wrong sequence. I like the feature to set a pressure then have it shut off automatically. Noisy but it does do the job."
2,AC plug doesn't work anymore,"I got this compressor specifically because it was AC/DC. The fourth time I used it the AC plug just quit working. There isn;t any reset for it, it just doesn't work. The 12 volt works fine but I'm apprehensive that will fail too.Airs up quick but I don;t think the pressure gauge in accurate. There was an 8 and 9 PSI difference from this gauge and two seperate tier pressure gauges.Save your money!"
3,It does what it says it will,It works fine for what it is built to do. I will keep it and use it. I was looking for a small compressor that would blow air so I could clean my spne heaters. This doesn't do that but it will inflate stuff and you can preset it to only go so high in air pressure. It will come in handy.
1,no good,"The first one I bought lasted about 2 months. I returned it, got my money back and bought another same kind (with an extended warranty of 1 year). This one lasted 1 1/2 years. I only use it occasionally and took good care of it. I had one of another brand years ago and it lasted at least 10 years."
4,Great unit--- Well thought out,"When you're home you can plug it in a conventional outlet. When you're on the road you can plug it in the car outlet. This is just what I was looking for. Of course, it takes awhile to pump 10 or 15 lbs into a car tire (they all do) but, you don't have to stand there and watch it. Just set the dial, turn it on, and walk away. It will stop when it's finished. Well made. I'm pleased."
4,tire inflator for student,"I bought the tire inflator to give as a gift for a high school graduate to take to college. I liked the size and ease of handling of the unit. As it is a gift, I didn't actually try the unit to determine how long it takes to inflate a tire."
1,Stopped Working,"This thing stopped working after 6 minor inflations. I had read others had this problem, but I decided to roll the dice. Black & Decker and other companies in the USA should stop putting their name on Chinese junk.I took it apart to see if there was a fuse inside that may have blown. No such luck. Removing the bottom panel reveals two electric motors, an ac/dc transformer, and a small circuit board. My guess is that a transistor or something on that board is what seems to fail for many people. I would not buy it again if given the choice."
3,hotair,The air station is much slower than the old model. The power cord and the air hose are way to short which requires the use of an extention cord and placement of the air station right next to the tire. Not recommended.
1,Piece of Junk Stopped Working!,"I purchased the Black and Decker ASI300 Air Station 7 months ago and I`ve used it about once every two weeks to top off my car tires. Just last week it wouldn't work when I plugged it into a wall socket to fill up my car tires, so I tried using the 12V car adapter and it too wouldn't work. After reading several reviews that said it was a bad fuse, I disassembled the unit and unsoldered the fuse from the circuit board to check the fuse for continuity. The fuse was fine but the unit still wouldn't work after re-assembly. My recommendation is that you stay away from the Black and Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator and spend you money on something more reliable.Sincerely,Joe M."
1,$3.81 to top off each tire,"About a year ago, I bought one of these. I topped off the tires on my family's two cars. Yesterday, the TPMS warning on my car lit up. I used this again to top off my tires. On the fourth tire, about a second after I started it, I heard a little popping noise and it stopped working. This might just be a blown fuse, but there's no easy access to check/replace it, and no mention of how to do so from the manual. Tech support is only opened M-F 8-5 eastern time, so I'll have to wait to find out.So far, this pump has been good for topping off 11 tires before it failed."
2,Disappointing product from B&D,"Here's the short and sweetPros:1. Works well, looks good as well2. Low noise and vibration (In my experience)3. AC & DC powered4. Cords stored inside the unit in a compartment5. Carrying handle6. Auto shut-off featureCons:1. Very hard to fit all cords back in the the unit. ( I thought about cutting off the AC cord with a pair of pliers to make room)2. Handle at the back is awkward and fingers kept pressing against the power switch.3. AC cord very short and the DC cord is not very long either4. DC cord has to be removed from the compartment and plugged in the back each time.5. The plastic top does not appear sturdy and the edges of the compartment's lid are somewhat sharpI guess I was expecting better from the brand and for the price."
4,Does what it does with no problems,"I don't get why people say its so loud, what do they expect? I'd like to see a quiet air compressor, lol. Anyways, for anyone that isnt a newb, the inflator works quite well, the only thing I wish it would have been included in the accessories was a presta valve adapter. I bought this to inflate my road bike mostly, but I just bought an adapter for 99 cents at the local bike shop. I really like the way it turns off by itself when it reaches the desired PSI."
2,Buy the Bon-Aire instead!,"I fill up bike tires for my kids, basketballs, soccer balls, dolly wheels and air mattresses and this is a piece of junk for me. I was willing to buy this and the Bon-Aire model at the same time, just knowing one version would be the clear winner ""out of the box"", and I was right! The Bon-Aire has MUCH long cords and hoses for simplicity. The Black and Decker? YUK."
3,good product but a bit noisy and hard to read dials,I purchased it to maintain tire pressures for both my cars. It is a bit noisy and it kind of hard to read the pressure dials since the dial's really small. it has a cut-off setting so what i usually do is set it to a higher pressure and then use a regular pressure gauge to bring it to the correct pressure.Also the power cable is very very short. I used a long extention cord to power it from the garage socket. It also has a 12V car battery connector so that we can use it on the road.
2,"Performance good, usability terrible.","The only pro to this pump is that it pumps like a champ.The cons are:Smooth exterior, no handle, relatively heavy and therefore easy to drop.Extremely short air hose and AC power cord.Cover for the short hose and AC power cord, but no cover for the DC power cord, it comes unraveled in the trunk.The power button is located inside the DC power cord storage area so you either have to take out the DC power cord to get to the power switch or you have to try to force your fingers into the compartment to get it to turn on.Useless ""industrial"" add-ons of faux nuts which are just little plastic pieces that fall off."
2,so so,"Great while it lasted, inflated my car and bicycle tires, 32 and 100 psi respectively, just fine and the automatic shutoff was reasonably accurately, compared to my tire pressure gauge. Developed an internal leak after about thirteen months and can no longer inflate my bicycle tires to the needed psi level."
1,Wish I had paid attention to review,I read the review and wish I had paid attention to review. Cords too short and on off switch in awful place . Terrible design.
1,"Cuts out, doesn't work","This thing has some sort of pressure detector that says it will stop inflating when there is enough air in the tire, basketball, etc. But it's worthless because it cut out 3 seconds after I turned it on and then wouldn't turn on again.Worthless--I returned it."
2,"Great, if only it worked.","I love the design and concept of this pump, however, the fuse will blow very easily, then the whole thing is trash. My husband is an electrical engineer, so he tore the thing apart and added a new fuse, twice, but it still keeps blowing fuses! So, as nice as it is, it's really just an expensive paperweight. Stay away! I'm looking for a pump now that will actually do what it's supposed to do."
4,"Easy, convenient way to inflate tires","I purchased the Black&Decker Air Station Inflator April 20, 2012, after being fed up with gas station air pumps that were either out of order or, after paying a dollar, not working properly. I should have purchased one years ago! It took only 1-2 minutes to top off each tire using the wall outlet in my garage as the power source. The device is easy to use, and the pressure display fairly accurate upon verification with a tire guage. I haven't tried it yet using the 12 volt auto battery connection, and can't yet attest to its durability, but so far I am completely satisfied."
1,not durable,"Have one of these, along with 2 trucks (big & small) and 2 bicycles. Auto shut-off worked great. But last time I was airing up my tires, it quit, and won't restart. A compressor I'd bought in 2002 for $40 lasted for 7 years. This one was $60 in 2009, but it died after 2 years 8 months. Now I'm back looking for a different one."
5,Awesome Air Compressor for the Value!,"I was in need of an Air Compressor but I did not want to get one that was huge. This little guy is pretty small and does the job! You set your PSI, plug it in and hook up to whatever needs air. The Air Compressor will stop automatically once it reaches the preset PSI. It is awesom if it ever breaks down I will be picking up another!"
1,Absolute junk,"Never even able to inflate one tire. Valve stem locking mechanism broke on initial use! Purchased with cerdit card points - now in process of trying to get a refund. Unfortunately thought I could depend on the Black & Decker name for quality. Should have read the reviews. Sounds like a fuse would blow after a few times anyway. Guess I'll have to get another like the one I bought 20 yrs ago for $25, and still have, from K Mart for my 2nd car."
3,hooked on the features,"i am replacing an older air station that lasted me 2 years of ocassional use. i consider this not good service. BUT its the only inflator out there that has automatic shutoff when desired pressure is achieved: it is both 12v and 120 volt so i can use it on my yacht so the deck hands can blow up water toys on 12v. i can afford to replace it in a year when the warranty runs out. if you dont need its unique features and are in the 47% that some politicians dont care about , you may want to consider another product. i find that most black&decker products dont last--its the CHINA thing."
1,did not last,"It worker great a couple of times, then it quit when I was filling up a tire. When I turn it on, it will light up, but it will not push out air."
2,B&D portable air compressor,"didnt last but a year or so.. then just wouldnt turn on anymore. both cords are very short.. when it worked, it worked fine. i need a more dependable unit."
1,"Good for bikes, not for cars.........",Used mine about 5 or 6 times; electric motor burnt out after only these few times. I won't buy another of these.
4,Extra air,"OK cord is a little short, but works fine. I like that it can run off of AC or DC.. a real help for coaches and sporting enthusiasts"
3,Does what it says it would do,"The option to use your car 12v plug or wall outlet is great. The wall outlet cord is extremely short so you will need an extension cord but the 12v line is plenty long for my Explorer and VW. I also used it to blow up an air mattress on a recent camping trip but the attachments did not work well for the approximate 1"" blow hole; had to use the smaller blow hole which took about 20 min to inflate. Don't know the accuracy of the psi gauge but seems pretty good or on point."
3,It is a toy that works,"This all plastic electric compressor unit does the job of slowly inflating your tires. The power cord and the air hose to the tires, both very short, are stored in a compartment with a hatch door on the top of the unit. The On/Off switch is located in the same compartment in the back of the unit where the cigarette lighter adaptor and cord is stored. This adaptor comes with a very long cord that needs to be removed from the compartment in order to gain access to the On/Off switch. When done, one would need to folded it and restore it in its very tight compartment. it In my opinion, this is the worst part of this unit. The switch should not have been some place else. Its current location adds two extra steps to the inflation process, if one wants to use the 120 Volt plug. I would cautiously recommended it since there are not that many other choices in that category."
1,No power!!,"This product will not be useful if you are looking to inflate cycle tires, but will work for sport balls..."
1,Fuse blown after second use,"AC fuse blown after second use. Internet search and you'll see this is a common problem and cannot be fixed. The fuse is soldered onto the circuit board.Unfortunately, I am 2 days out of my amazon return window.Do yourself a favor and don't purchase this air-station."
3,Quality oif unit,"The item looks good, is sized good, but it has a huge flaw. The air hose end is cheap plastic and brokethe first time I tried to inflate a tire. B&D; send me another unit, but it is still plastic. Cannot recommend this item."
2,air pump,the B&D ASI300 did not perform up to the standard that I expected . It did not work as good as my old 15 year old Craftsman
1,Not for high tire pressures!!,"I just blew up my second B&D Air Station. The first one failed after a couple of uses - it started leaking internally. Today my replacement failed - started making a different sound that sounds like something is stripped inside. I'm using it to inflate tires to 60, 72 and 80 lbs - so I'd say that's likely the problem. I guess I need to get a 'real' compressor."
1,This unit is terrible; don't buy it,"I got this as a gift, otherwise I would have returned it. The AC power cord requires an extension cord since it's ridiculously short. It cannot be used without an extension cord at all. The product design is terrible. The on/off switch is located inside the unit behind the DC power cord, so you have to pull that out even if you want to plug it into the wall. The unit is supposed to inflate to the PSI you set it to - that did not work properly on mine. I basically had to set it all the way up to max PSI to get it to pump up the tire on a baby stroller. Finally, it's incredibly awkward to handle. I'm surprised they didn't put some sort of handle on it. Black and Decker used to mean quality; this thing is terrible. I hope it breaks so I can buy a different product."
3,Good but cord and switch inconvenience,"You dial the pressure you want and turn it on; it shuts off automatically. It's loud, but quick on bike tires. For car tires, it takes longer of course. My only complaint is that turning it on and off requires unpacking the long cord for DC (""cigarette lighter"") power supply, and it's tightly packed. Then you have to pack it back in and I'm afraid the flimsy door over the compartment will eventually break. I'll probably put the cord in a little sack to make it easier. The AC cord is very short -- seems like it was designed mostly for filling tires on a road trip. But it works, that's what I was looking for. It will also be fine set up as a stationary ""pumping station"" in the garage for bikes and cars."
3,"Strange power-switch location, short power cable and hose","I haven't figured out why the power switch is located where it is located. It's extremely difficult to get to the switch, and we need to use the switch a lot.The hose and power cable are really short. The plastic valve adapter is flimsy.Other than that, it pumps well."
2,Great concept; Junk in a box,"Great features touted, lousy capabilities delivered. Hose to short, plastic valve handle breaks after a few usages, warranty now 1 yr vs. 2 (I guess B&D is confirming it's junk now). Compressor/auto shut off no longer functional after 1 yr of light usage."
4,Great to have around,"I don't know how I lived without one of these thing. I bought it to inflate a pool and it's been used for so much more than that. It's really portable. Plus incredibly easy to use. It was definitely worth the cost based on time saving alone.Con - it's incredibly loud, if you are outdoors your neighbors will without question hear it and possibly comment.Also the gauge and auto shut off is fairly useless for most of the household items I'm trying to inflate. You'll have to guess with pools, stability balls, bicycle tires, pool inflatables, and air mattresses as the gauge pointer will barely move.The ac power cord could not possibly be shorter. On the floor flush against the wall next to a power outlet at standard height is the length of the cord. So if you have anything in the way, you'll have issues. While that's where I currently have it placed, for most items I have to use an extension cord or dc power."
3,good try,"What a great idea and worked great for awhile. As long as you use it light duty for blowing up pool toys or balls and even car tires. Right after I used it for my truck tires, about 50 PSI, it stopped working. Coincidence maybe but I won't be burying another one, not for $50. I need something a little more reliable and heavy duty. I it fairly good to have if you just want something for toys. Especially with the AC/DC feature."
4,needs a presta adapter,I think there are too many nozzle adapter on this unit and Black & Decker forgot the Presta adapter which is used by bikers to inflate their road bikes. This would only cost cents for Black and Decker to add the adapter and many road bikers would buy this product.Another modification that Black & Decker could add to this product that will make this popular among road bikers and car drivers is to incorporate a schraeder and a presta hole adapter to the inflating end of the unit. I have seen some hand pump models that already have this innovation.
3,"OK, but not good enough","Black and Decker used to be an excellent product, but this is the second B & D item I've had recently that has broken too easily. It worked great for about two years, even though I didn't use it much during that time. Then it just quit working at all. I've decide to go with other brands in the future."
3,"so far, so good","I read all the bad reviews, but hey, I got a great price on it at a sale at a Black and Decker outlet store, so I figured what the heck!And to far it works great. Did my bike tires and the tires on a hard cart and it was quick and easy.Loud? about the same as any I have ever used.Slow? Faster than my old one, so I am happy.This is a light duty unit, but certainly all I need for occasional use.Will take one star off for the very short cords..although hat makes it possible to store them neatly inside the unit.Another star off for the plastic connector that no doubt will break easily.but so far, so good!"
3,General use only,"Main reason I bought this was really to air up my bicycle tires. I was getting tired (lazy) using my hand pump. Needed something inexpensive to get the job done. It worked out fine for the price. In addition to airing up my bike tires I've used it on my car and sports equipment. My only gripe about it is that the power cord is just too short (2ft). I usually have to grab an extension cord to comfortably reach what I'm airing up. Also, after each air up you have to turn the power off and then back on before moving on to the new assignment. My bike has 2 tires (duh) and as I air one up to the necessary PSI it'll automatically turn off and I'll have to toggle the switch before starting the next tire. Not a big issue but just one of those things. It's clean, simple, and compact. Perfect for traveling. I plan on taking it with me on my next camping trip to air up my air mattress. I like to tuff it out but in style!"
3,It works with with a few annoyances,It works. But the hose is too short and the hide-away space for the cord/hose too small.
2,Poorly designed!!,"It does work, but is Poorly designed!! Using the a/c power, the d/c cord has to be removed from it's storage to get to the on switch. Very inconvenient! The a/c cord and the air hose should both be about 6 feet longer. Who wants to get out an extension cord every time they want to plug it in? The coupler on the air hose is very flimsy, cheap and can't last long. The previous model air station was so superior to the new one and it was made in the USA! It was a/c power only but had long cords and hoses and wrap around storage for them. The switch was easy to get to. That thing was used almost daily, like any other home appliance. New one needs re-designed again to be much more user friendly, and made with better quality materials, such as a metal coupler and re-in-forced air hose. Sorry, I just think a company like Black & Decker could have done worlds better. Thanks!ProsAc or dc poweredConsAc cord is way too shortAir hose is way too short"
2,Better stuff is out there,"This product is a headache to use for several reasons:1) It almost never puts the correct amount of air in a tire (forget the gauges), maybe 20% of the time. Found the least time consuming way is to over-inflate, then use an external gauge for accuracy.2) It constantly has to be turned off and on, and frequently shuts off when trying to connect to the tire.3) Cords are short, unplug easily4) Is difficult to attach to the tire's air inlet.I would not buy this again, and am disappointed with Black & Decker. Another cheap Chinese-made product to avoid."
1,Works Okay Until it Breaks,Good for light use. Readings are not accurate. Mine broke after a little over a year of infrequent use. Apparently not powerful enough to handle inflating car tires.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY - THIS IS A NO BUY!,"A Black & Decker of old quality it is not: slow filling, cord too short to reach anywhere, gauge completely inacccurate and ours lasted 4 months before it died. Buy something else!"
2,Disapointed,Both the power cord and air hose are very short. You will need to use a extension cord every time you use it. The air hose is less than 2' long. The auto shut off is a nice feature.
2,Not Accurate,"Not accurate enough to properly inflate tires. Only a dial that estimates the air pressure. Also very, very slow on filling up a car tire, kind of loud , especially in gargage. On/Off button not easy to access, should be on top of device. Cords are supposed to fit in compartment, but you have to jam them in and shut the door quickly to get them in."
3,"LOUD, slow, but works","Pros:Small. Easily stored in your trunk.Light. Lug around with one hand easily.Cheap.Long cigarette lighter cord.Auto shutoff feature.Cons:LOUD! No idea what B&D; was smoking when they claimed this unit us ""quiet""Slow. A few seconds at a gas station, several minutes with this unit. Per tire!Laughably short AC cord.Pressure dial is hard to read."
1,Not for RV tireas,"Perhaps it's only me. The Amazon Search shows this as a RV tire inflator. The Product review seems to indicate that it will inflate RV tires. It will not inflate a motor home tire to the required pressure of 120 PSI.I have ""burned up"" two of them while only getting the pressure to 110 PSI. It might work on camper tires or Fifth Wheel tires, but not on a motor home tire."
1,A big disappointment,"I do not recommend this product. The fuse is of low quality and has a propensity to fail. Because of a design defect, the user cannot access the fuse to replace it. When you call the manufacturer, they attempt to get you to take the unit to a local ""authorized"" repair facility which is often in an undesirable area in major metropolitan areas. Most people will not want to spend several hours to take a $40 purchase to a god-forsaken location to get a 25 cent fuse replaced by another Chinese-made piece of garbage. This is a very expensive way to put air in a ball or two."
2,Not easy to use,"I received this as a gift. I asked for it - by model number - so nobody to blame but myself. I was surprised to find the power cord is only a foot long - if that! I don't know about you, but I rarely park that close to an outlet. Even if I did park right next to one, the outlets in my garage are high enough that the compressor would have to hang from it's own cord. It would not reach the floor. Maybe building code varies from region to region, but outlets in my garage were part of new construction - not added by the owner incorrectly.This will work fine for the person looking to inflate an air mattress/sports ball. There is no reason you could not do so indoors - using an outlet just above the floor. But if they really think this is convenient for the person looking to check and inflate their tires, they have to think again! I will need an extension cord at all times to use this in a garage. Poor design."
1,Let's the air out,I bought this from Lowes. I tried it on my car tire and it actually let air out of the tire and the pressure sensor sat at 0PSI. Somehow the internal pressure sensor had a leak and actually let air out. Returned.
4,For your information...,"I haven't used this more than three times so far. It worked well for my pressure washer tires, but for car tires be aware that if the tire is ALREADY almost properly inflated, the machine will not function. Don't think it's broken."
4,Thunder is very passionate.,"When I started this book I just couldn't get into it, about the first chapter or a little more. Then it got into it Thunder is very passionate, this makes only the second one that I have read, I am now into Indian Romance and hooked. I have found out they are very passionate, and brings excitement to you. I would like to see the cover for the men to look more Indian like. But other than that it was great."
5,Another awesome album from the greatest geek band ever!,"The Green Album is just as good, if not better than Weezers 1994 debut, the blue album. I love Weezer, and it is great to see them finally come back with another great album. All of the songs on this album are great (is there a such thing as a bad Weezer song?) and are very hard to not like. I was instantly hooked when I first bought weezers debut 2 years ago and this album is the same thing. ""Hash Pipe"" is a great song, but my personal favorite on this album is ""Knockdown Dragout."" I think almost any music fan would love this album, the songs are ingenious pop tunes. If you like there old songs ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Undone"" be sure to get this album too. Also check out Green Day, Blink 182, Less Than Jake, Mighty Mighty Bosstones."
5,Short but sweet,HAHA! Listen to me! Weezer comes through with a great little kicker album. Rock solid for 28 minutes.
3,Green Album,"I'm not a die hard Weezer fan. I bought the blue album and really only listened to Buddy Holly and Say it Ain't So. All the others were really blah and made me want to jerk the wheel. Nevertheless I bought the Green Album, even though I don't like Hashpipe; I had an extra 15 bucks and I wanted to give it a chance. ""Island in the Sun"" is a really fantastic song, even though the lyrics are mediocre, the tune is so catchy, it's impossible not to like. I give it 3 stars just for that song, ""Glorious Day"" is also good, and ""Crab"". I wouldn't say this is a must buy, but if you have an extra 15 bucks on you, buy it. It's a decent investment."
4,"not bad, not great","Basically, I'm going to start off this review by being completely redundant and repeating what everyone has previously said - this album has no resemblance to their previous works. It's a little more simplistic than the blue one and a little less dynamic and complex than Pinkerton (which by the way is their best). Granted, they have drifted slightly moreso into the realm of pop music , but unlike other certain extremely bitter reviewers, I don't think an appearance on TRL is necessarily bad - I pay more attention to the music of the group and not the image. The album is relatively enjoyable; its catchy. It's good to listen to in a fun environment, such as hanging out with friends, or driving, but if you're looking for substance and dynamics in your music, check out Pinkerton. Not too much deep thinking going on in the lyrics, and most of the guitar solos simply follow the melody of the words exactly. But nonetheless (and to be redundant one last time), it is overall not bad."
3,average,"This a very generic album...there is not much stuff in here that differentiates it from other bands out today...Weezer's first album was much more original and diverse...this, as one other reviewer said, is almost 'too simple'..."
1,what is this!,Don't buy this cd! here are my three reasons why1.buy the old weezer cd its alot better don't waist your money. 2.only ten songs with one good one!3.only 28 minutes long!please don't waist your mony on this ...album buy somthing better or with more and better songs on it
1,"Say it aint so, Weezer","I rushed out and bought this CD the first day it came out, having only heard hash pipe (which i thought was so so), because i have been a huge weezer fan since the beginning. I loved the blue album, and pinkerton is even better, but i found only one song on this album that i really liked (that being simple pages). This album, to me, sounds like Weezer was just desperately trying to recapture the profitability of their debut, only now there's no substance left. This CD is just a huge hit machine with, more or less, one song repeated over and over again. If you're a real weezer fan, get pinkerton, otherwise leave this album alone, its as corporate as they get."
5,Short and sweet,"After reading some of the reviews, I've come to the realization that some people will find fault in anything. I guess when you wait five years to release an album, your fans build up really high expectations.I for one love this album. I had to listen to it 3 or 4 times before coming to that conclusion though. I do agree that the last few songs sound really similar, but each one is good in its own way. Overall, it's probably not as good as either of the first two albums, but then again, how many cd's are?"
1,BLAND!,What happened to the weezer who was ambitious and explored. This new album is a weezer who's afraid to take risks. Every song sounds similar from start to finish.
4,A Great Album.,"I was a big Weezer fan back in the day, but after Pinkerton came out, I lost interest. I hadn't even ever listened to it, but I was real picky and funny about the music I listened to at the time. I heard Weezer was putting together a new album, so I got out my copy of 'the blue album' and listened to it from beginning to end, and what a great and ORIGINAL sounding record it is. As far as this album, its not as great as 'the blue album' or as far out as 'Pinkerton' but it stands out, almost like it compliments their previous two releases.I would say it's fairly impossible to recreate the magic that came from 'the blue album' but they have definitely got the hooks and catchy songs this time around, sprinkled with simple guitar riffs and laden with really great lyrics.If your a Weezer fan or even just a music fan, pick this album up, not to mention the other two albums. They're great records to just sit and listen to."
3,"Very good, but a little too Green Day","You either like Weezer or you don't. I do. So, I bought it and found that it is a lot like Green Day. Rivers sounds like Billy and so on. That is not a bad thing. The songs are poppy and combination or sorts of their last two albums. It has the instrumentation of Pinkerton and the pop-catchy lyrics of their debut album. In my opinion, all the people that are racing out to buy the overrated REM album should reconsider and pick this one up. It would probably make my Top 20 list at the end of 2001."
2,In it for the GREEN,"Well, this album looks to go at least platinum probably. They'll lose most of their credibility beyond their die-hard fans, and probably lose a somewhat significant chunk of their fanbase. But hey, look at the bright side! They'll gain it back with all the teeny-boppers and trend-followers from the MTV audience! Sorry, but this album just isn't Weezer to me. It's a homogenized, commercialized version of what they once represented: good rock music. I guess there is a glimmer of hope for a good album after the success of this one, but I wouldn't be too optimistic about it."
1,Horrible,"28 minutes long, and the second half of the cd sounds the same. All the songs follow the exact same format, verse chorus, verse guitar solo repeating the verse, chorus. Unlike their other CDs this is unimaginative, rushed, and overall crappy. I want to throw it out of my window but I'm afraid someone will pick it up and have their ears infected."
2,mall punk band covering weezer.,"you should be familiar with the term ""mall punk"" by now. it's the epitaph/fatwreckchrods/srv1 souding bands that are pretty much one band with a lot of masks. then people go to hot topic, by their cds and some big shorts, and claim to be punk rock. it's pretty funny.okay, now imagine one of those bands trying to play weezer songs. it's okay because they're playing weezer, but it is bad because they're being played by mall punks.it's not that the songs on this cd are bad or anything, it's just that they could sound so much better if played differently. weezer recently said that ""pinkerton"" wasn't good bbecause it only sold 500,000 copies. it sounds like they want a #1 album and will do anything to have one, including recording a bad album."
1,Uhmm...,"What a waste of time and money. 10 songs and hardly 20-30 minutes... of pure mediocrity.Weezer is an amazing band...just don't bother on this one folks. Pinkerton and the Blue album are just classics. I Respect those guys a whole lot.This is just...disappointing to say the least. It's just BAD, even for a Weezer fan. Lately Weezer has been trying to do with their nerd-rock label and are going for an almost loveable, adorable sort cutesy label.I can't make myself clear enough. Don't go near this album, it's just the bottom of the corporate barrel."
1,Rivers should pay you for having to listen to this garbage,"Ever bought an album only 28 minutes long, which included one good single and 24 minutes of filler? You can answer ""YES"" if you bought Weezer 2001! Ridiculous attempt to combine ""Blue"" with Green Day's ""Dookie"". Avoid avoid avoid."
4,::sigh:: not as good as it use to be,this album is definitly not as good as the old ones. island in the sun is a really good song. but the rest of the album sounds about the same. it's weird because you can just tell which one of the songs they're going to put out as singles and which ones are just going to blend around. the blue cd was a much better one. go back that one and ask your friend to burn this one for you.
3,"Has high points, but some tracks are too alike","I've known Weezer since ""Buddy Holly"" (remember when it was on Windows 95 discs?), I've heard their debut but only remembered ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Say It Ain't So."" For 5 years, I heard nothin from them (I missed Pinkerton). Then came ""Hash Pipe,"" a song I didn't think sounded Weezer-ish when I first heard it. SO I thought maybe they have a harder sound. But not really on this CD. While it isn't a bad CD, it tends to get old after a while, but doesn't seem too long for its 28 minute length. The first 4 tracks are all awesome: ""Don't Let Go,"" ""the Beach Boys-esque ""Photograph,"" ""Hash Pipe,"" and the amusing ""Island in the Sun"" The next 3 are all good, from ""Crab"" to 'Smile."" The last 3 tracks sound too alike, but aren't bad. Overall, it's not a bad album, it has a great sound, although some songs are disposable. Best song: ""Hash Pipe"" (yeah, I'm unoriginal, I know)"
1,"This band now rocks, DUDE!!","What a great CD!! THIS is real emo!! Weezer used to be a dumb ripoff group with stupid lyrics, but now they are approved by the god of good music, Carson Daly. ""Hash Pipe"" is so cool, my punk cover band called ""Punk Kings"" plays this song endlessly at our shows, not to mention ""Photograph"". My 18 year old brother keeps telling me that At The Drive In, The Dismemberment Plan, Fugazi, and Sparta is real emo. Well, all of those bands are stupid ripoff bands with lame lyrics. There can only be one ""Jimmy eat world"", right? If you don't get this CD, you aren't a real emo lover. PUNK OUT!!"
1,What happened?,"Somebody reminde me, how many years since Pinkerton (which i consider to be pure genius) came out has Rivers had to write songs for this album? It sounds like he just gave up, or sold out (in the worst sense of the term)."
2,Not as good as old weezer,"This cd has some good tunes on it ie Hash Pipe Island in the sun, Crab, but if u really like weezer than you definatly will like the Blue album better."
3,Not quite the same,"This is a good album. It's fun, and upbeat. But at a mere 28 minutes, the boys of Weezer don't get to say too much.This is a far cry from the Blue album, wich is one of the best albums ever made."
2,lackluster,i expected genuis after pinkerton. too bad green album is a pop cop out. there are some goat punishment songs that i expected to hear on here.
2,What Happened????,"When Weezer reappeared with a series of concerts in the fall of 2000, fans all over rejoiced. Until they actually heard the album, that is. That Rivers Coumo denounced Pinkerton and proclaimed the Green Album their greatest so far is a view he will live to regret. The Green album is decent according to the precedents set this year with all the PapaStaindVayne garbage, but the generic lyrics and repetitive riffs are mind-numbing at best, especially when compared to Pinkerton."
3,not good old weezer,"Weezer's first two efforts, especially Pinkerton, were brilliant albums. On the green album, Weezer prove yet again that they can produce some excellent melodies. There is great energy in the first 4 songs, but then everything suddenly kind of collapses. The last 6 songs (excluding the last track) are all very similar and not very interesting. But Weezer work their magic on the first 4 tracks which is good enough in my opinion. Finally, the green album is only 28 minutes long. I suspect Weezer weren't exactly bursting with creativity while making this album."
4,Nothing that hasn't already been said,"This is a great power pop record, way too short, but great for driving and singing along to"
3,Not even close..,"It's funny how hype clouds one's view. Most of these reviews say how genious this album is, when truth be told it is unoriginal pop with uninspired lyrics.Remember how you felt River's sadness in The World Has Turned and Left Me Here, or how about in practically any song off Pinkerton. If that's one of the reasons you love Weezer, because of heartfelt lyrics that are sincere, than the Green Album is not for you.Many people are comparing it to the Blue album, which in my humble opinion is their best album, ever followed closely by Pinkerton. It is not anything near the greatness of the Blue Album. The songs are boring and short. Although a few songs on this album are simply OUTSTANDING (see Hash Pipe) the rest are just, blah.Weezer fans buy at your own risk; but be prepared for disappointment. The teeny boppers will just eat this stuff up."
3,not as good as first 2,"As a big Weezer fan, I couldn't wait for this album that turned out to be a disappointment. Although better then most music today, this is not nearly as good as the blue album. Hash pipe is pretty good. Island in the suns alright, but I think maybe Weezer could have done better. Weezer fans should buy it but Weezer is not gonna win any favor with this album from new fans. Oh well, maybe the next album will be another blue album."
4,"Weezer go a little more mainstream,","But the die hards will still enjoy. The album stil has great songs, but there exists a lacking of builds ups and 8 minute songs such as only in dreams). Don't let go, photograph, and knock down drag out truly rock. the album grows on you.My problem is that now 12 year old teenie boppers are gonna ""love "" weezer, and the true fans will just blend in. clearly there is a desire on the part of weezer to go mainsteam, but where are the references to goats and japanese girls, i pine for the days of pinkerton, but appreciate the new simpler stuff.Good or bad, this is an album every should and wil have. there is something for everyone within enjoy"
3,It's alright,"I liked their other CDs better. I thought this CD lost the geekiness that was in their other releases. I liked the lyrics in their other releases better, and thought they sounded cooler in harmony. It was also too short (but then again, a lot of great CDs are short). Then again, I've only listened to this twice. It just seemed kinda lacking."
3,wish it was longer,"Im sure everyone who bought this album is thrilled to have new music from Weezer. This is a decent album - its got a different sound - the Blue album seems a bit harder and Pinkerton seems a bit faster. This album is only OK. The songs are a bit more quieter and dont seem to have the emotion behind them that the first 2 did.My other major disappointment is that this album is so short - at just under 29 minutes. After waiting so long, i wanted more!"
2,overall a pretty big disappointment,"I am a pretty big fan of Weezer. buddy holly basically defines the 90's music! I eagerly awaited the release date and rushed out to buy it along with the new REM cd. I put it in, and i was pretty disappointed. there just seems to be something missing from it. What i dont get is that it took them 5 years to put together 28 minutes worth of songs. i paid 13.99 for 28 minutes of songs with virtually no booklet insert. The songs are alright, some of them stand out while some of them sound like fillers. thats why im giving it two stars. but i was very disappointed, i guess i was just expecting more. check out the new REM album though, that one's a keeper."
4,"If you want it, you can have it...","I am a long time Weezer fan, and I like every Weezer CD. Like most fans, my favorite Weezer CD's are Pinkerton and The Blue Album, but for me, this one and Maladroit aren't that bad either.I like this one a little bit better than Maladroit. This CD is definitely their poppiest and brightest CD yet. You can just look at the titles and see that (""Smile"", ""Glorious Day""). But even though it's quite poppy and peppy, it's not pop from your average boy band. This is Weezer, so you'll still hear a little hard rock in there (""Hash Pipe"").My favorites are ""Don't Let Go"", ""Crab"", ""Knock-down Drag-out"", and ""Glorious Day"".Yeah, you probably remember ""Undone"" and ""Buddy Holly"" from 1994. So go ahead, re-introduce yourself to Weezer."
4,"Green Album:Mediocre for Weezer,Still Better than Most Music","Okay- so Pinkerton is the best Weezer album, pretty much everyone agrees on that - this is a more pop-like album for Weezer and the songs aren't as great and memorable as some of the ones on Weezer's other albums, but still they are a great band and compared to other bands this album is pretty good. If you are a new Weezer fan, I would suggest you start with the Blue Album or Pinkerton, but the Green Album deserves a listen, too. It is great to see how the band has changed and progressed, so any Weezer fan should have this album."
4,Weezer rules,"If you have a spare money just lying around the house, buying Weezer-The Green Album is a very smart thing to do. The green album has just about anything from hard heavy rock, all the way down to soft rock. So you are bound to find something of interest in the cd."
4,good but could be a lot better,"From hearing Weezer's first two albums and looking at the long gap between Pinkertown the green album, I was expecting something a little bit more of a new sound. Both the blue album and Pinkerton were good albums that had a unique sound to them. The Green album is good with songs like O girlfriend, photograph and island in the sun but it lacks the same type of creavity that marked their previous efforts."
3,good but after while you wont like it,"Welcome back Weezer. I love Weezer as much as the last person and I'm very happy to see them back again. Their new cd is titled ""Weezer"" aka the green album. The Green Album is taking Weezer back to the days when they first came out with tunes like ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Undone, the Sweater Song"". But it just doesn't deliver like the blue album did. There are about five songs which I can listen to all the time, but after that I want to strangle Weezer. Quit saying the same thing over and over again. If you listen to this cd a lot, all the songs start to sounds the same and you can't tell when one begins and the other ends. So if your hard core into Weezer or just like a lot of happy pop, this is the cd for you. If you want some variety in your music, I'd say try someone else."
2,The fall of self-absorbed nerd rock,"The changing lineup known as Weezer was first introduced to a post-Nirvana era in 1994, playing the role as the cute, nerdy fuzz rock band you couldn't resist. Then after the departure of Matt Sharp (who could have made him want to leave? hmm...), the quartet went from a poppy Pavement rip-off (Self-titled, Pinkerton) to a grungie Roy Orbison (the Green Album). This third effort to squeeze whatever money they could from fat Hot Topic chicks with pig tails was the most bland and incomplete garbage to ever come from Cuomo's indulgent brain. They could've done us a favor and performed a mass suicide on TRL, but instead chose to continue the poison onward with Maladroit (a name coming from a fan that Bell proclaimed as ""smart""). I was once a religious man, but these last couple of albums have made me question if there could be a God, and if so, why does he hate me?"
1,what the hell were they thinking,"WHAT IS THIS! Weezer did not make this album. after making 2 amazing albums they come back after hiatus with this pos. Every song is a cheesy radio song (which is kind of weezers trademark, but these have no edge), the guitar solos just mimic the vocal pattern, this album is just not rockin. if any other band made this album it might be half way decent, but a band as respected as weezer can do much better than this. If you dont own any weezer albums, dont buy this one. The green album does not do this amazing band justice."
1,weezer - matt sharp = unintelligent pop.,"weezer's original self titled album, aka the blue album, is a timeless classic. their sophomore release, ""pinkerton"", didn't quite offer what their debut release did, but is still worth purchasing. the latest in the self titled collection, aka the green album, is a pathetic attempt at an album. all of the songs lack the substance that the earlier material contained. and to make matters worse, the disc is shorter than a typical 30 minute teeny bopper television show that a newer weezer fan would watch. how can any band release an ""album"" that is less than 30 minutes and not think it an insult to their dedicated fans? matt sharp's departure from weezer after ""pinkerton"" has proven nothing but disastrous for the band. if any former weezer fans reading this have an unfulfilled desire for the intelligent pop rock we knew as weezer, look into matt sharp's current project, the rentals."
1,Weezer is dead,"Therer was once a time when i too was ecstatic at the thought of another weezer album. Haveing had the pleasure of seeing them in their prime, i considered myself quite a weezer addict. And for those of you who do not believe that Pinkerton is an amzing album, you obviously have no idea what you are talking about. So then the green Album came out, and what a great day it was for us all. But by about the third time through on my car stereo i realized this was no blue, and definately no Pinkerton. I could not believe what Rivers had done, and he could loose total conciousness of who he is, in a total quest to be a cliche rockstar. If you like Blink 182 and that other rubsish, by all means buy this album, but if you are really looking for some real music that doesn't have the same sound song after god damn song keep looking, becuase you are not going to find it here."
3,not half bad.,"Sure it's dissapointing for weezer standards, and it's saying something that I have a burned cd of all their b-sides that I like more than this album, but it is enjoyable in it's own right. they're lowering their standards a bit here, forsaking lyrical depth and musical complexity and sort of becoming the ""perky power pop"" band everyone called them when they actually weren't, but this album does do it's job well as a short burst of happy pop music, which is what it's meant as. A bit formulaic (almost all the songs except the singles ""island in the sun"" and ""hash pipe"" use the exact same ""intro guitar melody used as vocal bridge later/verse/chorus/verse/vocal line guitar solo"" pattern), but they also end the thing right before it starts to wear thin. Don't expect another blue album or pinkerton, and don't pay much attention to the lyrics, just enjoy the 28 minutes of catchy melodies and go do something else."
2,yawn,"i remember when this album first came out: it was my sophomore year of high school, the cover was blue, they had a different bassist... oh, wait a minute...this cd is not the band's best work. ""hash pipe"" is a relatively catchy song. however, if you have heard that track, you have heard them all: simple pop songs with just enough guitar bite to retain credibility, vocal melodies cleverly disguised as guitar solos, you get the idea.this disc is not as refreshing as 'the blue record' was and its not as punk (for lack of a better word) as 'pinkerton'.weezer played it too safely this time."
3,"Weezer's worst, but still good.","This cd compared with Weezer's other two cds is by far the worst. No one song on this cd is as good as any song on Pinkerton, their best album by far. That does not mean that this album is not good, it just didn't live up to the high standards set by their first two albums. I would suggest that if you already have the Blue Album and Pinkerton, that you should get this. If you don't have either of those buy Pinkerton, and then the Blue Album."
4,So it's not their best. Who cares?,"I can't say this can compare to their other two albums. What I CAN say is that it's certainly similar. The hooks are infectious, the lyrics are adequate, and all Weezer's elements are still here. Don't worry about the 28 minute length; that shouldn't be a problem. I have only one gripe: the solos are unbelievably cookie-cutter. Whatever happened to Rivers' beautifully crafted Say it ain't so and Why bother solos? (Not to mention the stellar guitar-work on Undone, too.) So it's not as complex as their other two. It's still weezer, and it's still good."
2,Catchy pop songs...but talent? No.,"It seems like everyone in high school who shops at thrift stores likes Weezer. Sure, Cuomo can write a catchy melody that gets stuck in your head, but catchy does not equate talent. This is no better than the rest of the mindless pop/""nu metal""/""punk"" crap you hear on the radio every day. High school kids who shop at thrift stores, wear horn rimmed glasses, and have those ridiculous bowling shoes listen to Weezer because they think by listening to a band that doesn't get played on the radio all the time, it will mean they have good taste in music. These types of kids all dress and talk the same, they're just as much a clique as the Abercrombie crowd. Go ahead and try to convince yourself that Weezer has talent, but if you do that you might as well start listening to Britney Spears because they're both in the same ever growing boat of horrendous popular music."
3,Yawn,"Weezer used to have an edge or two to them, but now it's all gone. This is pretty much straight, bland, nineties-style pop. Some guys, some guitars, some hooks, nothing special. No risks. The album cover is pretty similar to Elvis Costello's first album cover in the seventies, which shows how little commercial pop has advanced lately. Sigh. Catchy, disposable stuff."
4,Weezer's best album,"I've sampled nearly all of Weezer's albums, but this album and Maladroit were the only two I felt compelled to buy. This album delivers ten songs that sound very similar to one another, the only real difference being song tempo. The standout tracks are definitely ""Hash Pipe"" and ""Island in the Sun."" Weezer's best album to date, better than Maladroit and surprisingly better than Make Believe. Albeit on the short side (under half an hour long), this is a must-have for any die-hard Weezer fan."
4,gooooooooooood soft music,if your riding in the car with a grandma or some s*** like that this music is great. just flip the track when it comes to h*sh pipe. the songs are really good except there are a few that sound too much alike. only buy this if you like weezer's style (which is soft and calm rock and roll)2 best songs: photograph & island in the sun2 worst songs: knock down drag out & crab
2,only 28 mins long???,"Some catchy tunes, all the songs blend into each other and before you know it the CD is done!!! less than 1/2 hour of music.These guys could be really great, there previous albums prove that.This seemed like a project that Weezer rushed out to get something on the shelf so we wouldn't forget who they are. I suspect the record company had a lot to do with the rush job as well."
5,more than five stars actually,if you don't like THIS album you must not be a TRUE weezer fan because this is like the other albums and the same great type of music and the same great band
2,Does not live up to Weezer's potential,"Listen people, I am a Weezer fan, and I am as sad as you are that this album is not terrific. I just loved Pinkerton because it showed such real emotion and was not made for MTV. All of the songs on the Green album sound the same and don't ""speak"" to me at all. I would really suggest going out and buying Pinkerton with great songs like ""Pink triangle"" ""El Scorcho"" and ""Butterfly"""
4,I like it,"I am a big Weezer fan, and have been looking forward to them regrouping for the new record. I have to say, I like everyone of the 10 songs on this album. The record clocks in under a half an hour, which I feel is just a little too short.. It really leaves me wishing there was more.Also, the entire album feels very ""forced"".. The songs are well structured and catchy, but none of them seem very inspired."
4,Sounds like Weezer,"Weezer return after five years. I disagree with the band claiming the record is somewhere ""between Pinkterton and the blue album"", though I wish it were true. Production-wise, it's extremely sharp, very similar to the blue album. Musically, the songs on the green album are half as complex (as Pinkterton, at least). The solos (almost all of them) are simply the vocal melody churned out on guitar. Rivers can shred on guitar, but he totally opted not to on this album. Lyrically, it seems practically without meaning. Considering it's Weezer, and their prior song topics and lyrics, this album is weak by comparison. Not that they are BAD lyrics, they are simply pop lyrics. (Rivers himself is quoted saying that ""the lyrics suck""...) HOWEVER... despite all of this, you're still left with an amazingly infectious power pop rock album that I don't think should disappoint many people. It's not groundbreaking, but it's just good rockin music that few bands create like this."
3,Say it AINT SO!!!,"If you have never heard weezer's first two albums, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! i have been listening to weezer a long time and ""the blue album"" and ""pinkerton"" are way better than this. Yes, the green album is way better compared to other artists. I thought that after track 4 (island in the sun,) the songs sounded the same. Pinkerton is my favorite album because it has awesome bass, guitar, and drums. the emotion is great and the album is better each time you listen to it. If you are a first time listener, i reccomend you buy the cd's in the order they were released. First buy the blue album then pinkerton. you will appreciate weezer more for the great band that they are. I find that Rivers Cuomo's song writing was too formulated on the green album.to sum it all up, the first two albums are better than the green album."
2,An Absolute Shock,"Being a Weezer fan since the day I heard the blue album, and a diehard since I heard Pinkerton, Weezers return to music in the form of ""Weezer(2001)"" was an exciting prospect. Although I did not believe they could top their masterpiece(pinkerton), I expected at worst, a strong effort from a great band.I got far less than that. Instead I received 30 minutes of emotion-derived, boring, simplistic, radio-friendly songs from a band that USED to be good. I can only hope this is rock bottom for weezer, and they will rebound from this atrosity. Songs like don't let go, knock-down dragout and glorious day show how unimaginative this album really is. While I believe the album has some solid songs(Hash Pipe and O' Girlfriend) they are heavily outweighed by the generic sound the rest of the songs have. Simply put, don't waste your money(although you don't have to worry about wasting your time, its only 30 minutes long after all)."
2,The biggest disappointment of the year,"I love Weezer... and I have for years now. That's why I find this new albums contents extremely depressing. Is this what we waited 5 years for? A 10 song, 29 minute album? The first half is pretty acceptable. ""Don't Let Go,"" ""Photograph,"" and ""Island In The Sun"" are among the albums best... but the second half of the album sounds like pretty much the same song over and over. The structure is the same, the lyrics are terrible, the solos are weak... I'm sure in all the time off they wrote hundreds of songs... if these are the best then I fear for the future of Weezer. They used to be something truly great."
2,Not the worst album ever,After 5 years i think everyone was expecting a lot more but Weezer just couldnt match the myth that they had become. there are some good songs on this album but nothing too amazing. actually the songs on this album are kinda forgettable and bland. i would get maladroit over this album.
1,"take blue album, remove thought and charm.","this album was INCREDIBLY, STUPIFYINGLY disappointing. to call it bland and pointless is almost too nice. here we have a man who has written hundreds upon hundreds of songs in the last 3 years, who has written some fine melodic pop-rock in his day, and this is the BEST he can do? i mean, when the only song that stands out of the blandness is ""Hash Pipe,"" it's clear something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.this all may sound harsh, but honestly - who told rivers [cuomo, the singer/songwriter/guitarist of the band] that he could write an album of filler?painfully bad lyrics, empty melodies, absence of emotion and charm - that about sums up weezer's ""green album."" at least we know they can't get any worse."
2,El Crapo,"This album defies logic. It is weezer - yet is stinks. Do not listen to all the brainwashed ""5 star 'cuz it's weezer idiots"". This album has two good songs (Island in the sun & Hash Pipe). The rest of the album rots. If you do not own PINKERTON - go and buy it - if you have a sensitive bone in your booty - PINKERTON will touch you and rawk you - this green album is VERY STERILE. The next album better be better than this offering - otherwise I won't spend my hard earned dough on this band."
4,Semi-...Good,"I think that this cd compared to the first cd is kind of lacking, mostly in the time it takes up.. it is a very good cd but a little more mellow than what i was jonesin for. It is still a must have for any weezer fan. Go out and buy it. dont get your friend to burn it..."
5,Great Album,"This is definetly Weezer's best album since the debut. After a disappointing second album, the green album has the melodic hard crunching feel of their first. Over all a great album with lots of catchy hooks."
1,What happened here?,"I really don't know how any Weezer fan can really say this is a great album. There is nothing here that comes close to the previous records... I realize being a fan means sticking by your band no matter what is released, but don't believe anyone who gave this record more than two stars... every song has the same formula... verse, chorus, verse, chorus, then solo that mimics the verse...followed by the final chorus... this album is so predictable and i'm disappointed that the talented rivers delivered this cop out... i'm a huge fan of the band and look forward to the next album... there were quite a lot of songs written during the last five years, why they chose these 10 B sides is beyond me..."
1,CATCHY BUT UNINSPIRED,"The rhythm guitar is nothing but random noise, every solo just mimics the singing melody, and the only songs that don't sound alike are the singles. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the blue album, Pinkerton, and Make Believe, I think this is utter garbage, and any critic who liked this must've been smoking something serious. Most of the album is just mish mash and noise. TERRIBLE!! Actual rating 1 1/2 stars."
1,not worth the wait,"not Weezer's best work. Lacks the poppy craftsmanship of the first record. It also lacks the power and intensity of Pinkerton. What happened? Matt Sharp left. Perhaps Rivers and the guys are getting complacent, but this record fails to rock, and it failed to get stuck in my head. Buy Pinkerton if you haven't already. I'll be looking for an improved 4th record."
5,Weezer rocks!,"Weezer once again has done an awesome rock CD! Sure, it's not as godd as the PERFECT Blue Album, and it's short but every song's awesome and is worth repeating. Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, Photograph, Don't Let Go, O Girlfriend, and Glorious Day are my favorite songs! Another necessary CD for Weezer and rock fans!"
2,Yuckey!,"This is a terrible piece of [junk]! The only good songs on it are Island in the Sun and Hash Pipe. The bass player [stinks], Rivers [stinks] on lead guitar. JUST BUY THE SINGLES! FORGET THE REST OF IT!"
5,One of the Best Albums of 2001,"Perfectly crafted pop gems. All 29 Not one portion of the 29+ minutes wasted. My personal favorite, Simple Pages."
2,Come Back Jonee,"The sound of the green album is the sound of a still very good band watering themselves down - and it's hard not to assume it's a blatant attempt to appeal to the Blink-182/Sum 41 crowd. It's not that any of the songs are bad. It's just that there's NO VARIATION! I was obviously not expecting anything as 'deep' as Pinkerton (not that it's that deep but still my fave) but they've regressed beyond the Blue album. It's like a album featuring10 variations on Buddy Holly - no rhythmic or dynamic variations AT ALL, except for one. No In the Garage, no Only in Dreams, not even a Sweater Song. I guess it paid off for them but I don't think I'm the only person who first heard the Sweater Song on the radio, on the last day of school, in 1993, who's feeling pretty miffed and alienated now."
3,"Good stuff, but they've done better","Alright, if you're looking for new music, the Green Album was one of the best albums to come out in 2001. But, they've seriously done much better work on their previous albums. This album has some classic songs on it though, like 'Photograph,' 'Hash Pipe,' 'Island in the Sun,' 'Smile,' 'Simple Pages,' and the rest are kind of iffy. For example: Don't let go. ""Don't let go"" is a song that sounds like any pop star, 16 year old, JLo wannabe who just wants to cash in would write. ""Don't let go....ewww, woah, woah."" That's IT. THAT's the Song. It's a good album compared to the [stuff] that came out in 2001, but Weezer is better than this. To find better stuff one should look at their first two albums."
2,TOTAL LETDOWN,"Damn you Weezer! Why abandon all the musical growth you present on Pinkerton, and replace it with THIS POPPY CRAP. Its the blue album WITHOUT THE CATCHYNESS!!! every song drags you to the next one, no tempo or mood changes at all... The new bass player sucks too. He plays every damn song EXACT the same notes as the guitar. I saw Weezer on the green album tour, and was not impressed too many Green album songs - NO PINKERTON SONGS AT ALL, and a lot of songs from Maladroit wich also sucks."
1,The worst collection of music released by man:,"This is an incorrigible, pitiful excuse for a modern rock album.If you want personality, depth, good production, and lyrics that won't unintentionally inspire laughing fits, look elsewhere. Try Killing Joke or Wendy Carlos or Primal Scream."
1,Twenty Eight Minutes Too Long,"I want to be brief here, this album is total garbage. Hash Pipe is a cheezy three chord riff that was heard twenty years ago with different lyrics. I actually think Spinal Tap's record is a hundred times better than this. My little brother could come up with a riff that's better than Hash Pipe."
5,Weezer has done it again!,"For long-time Weezer fans disappointed by the lack of happy ""sing-along-songs"" in Pinkerton, Weezer has redeemed themselves. Much like the original Weezer release, its one of those CD's that puts you in a happy mood, and you just can't help but attempt to sing a long to the words, even if you have no idea what they are. For skeptics worried that bassist Matt Sharp has left an irreplacable hole in the band in his departure, the new bassist Mikey more than makes up for his absence. Sharp has even gone on to form another band on the same line as Weezer, called the Rentals, which has released equally impressive cuts. Weezer returns to the basics in ""the Green Album"", and makes listeners ache for more. It is truly a joy to listen to. If you are new to Weezer, or just want a CD to bring you out of the doldrums of everyday life, buy this CD and you will take it on countless spins through your CD player."
5,Short simple good,This is a good cd. I like all of there albums it is too bad that they only have three now. The only thing about this cd is that it is very short. 10 songs like normal but only about 30 mins. that really is ok as long as the songs are all good and they are. This is more like the first album and should be more popular than the pinkerton release.
2,28 minutes of the same songs,"only 10 songs? 28 minutes? And the same price as most other albums. This one was not worth the buy. Much of the songs seem productively hurried as if studio time came into account. With the exception of three songs: Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, and O Girlfriend, the rest pretty much put out a passive sound. Sounding the same one after another. Making the 28 minutes feel like and hour and half. After patiently waiting for this album, it has fallen short of everything and these days, with MP3's and free downloads, one or two songs can no longer carry an album to sell.Other albums released this year that are worth buying are Linkin Park - Hybrid Thoery, Incubus - Morning View, Stone Temple Pilots - Shangri-La Dee Da, and Staind - Break the Cycle."
1,So Bland,"This CD has to be the most bland record out there right now by a band that knows better. A very big disappointment. No hooks, melodies, and catches in the songs that Weezer usually have. The single ""Hash Pipe"" sounds like a throw away track from a bad Green Day cover band. DO NOT BUY!"
3,We wait for 5 years...and you give us this.,"Ewww....Weezer is really underachieving on this album. I don't have a clue what the editorial review is talking about. Pinkerton was something creative and new, it was good. Blue was good also. This album offers nothing new. It's a wanna-be blue, and does a bad job of it. The solos are horrible compared to the first two albums, they just follow the verse. The guitar work is boring. This album is better than most of the music out there today, so I give it 3 stars. Compared to the first two albums, it deserves 1 star."
5,they're back!,The gods of rock return with an album that is pure pop perfection. Every song is well written to being extremely catchy and extremely pleasant to listen to. I don't think Weezer can make bad music.
3,Weezer is back,"Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome album, but its just not up to par with the other two. Thats why I only gave it 3 stars. There is somthing missing from this album that are in the other 2 that i cant quite put my finger on. The other two have more feelings in it. This album is just layed back chill music, which is fine. I just hope they go back to their harder stuff on their next album. This album has a different feel to it. Hash Pipe and Island in the sun are definatly the best songs. Knock-down Drag-out is pretty good too. This is a really short album. Its not even a half hour long. Compared to the other garbage out there these days, you will love this album."
1,Had to add my 2 Cents,"Which is about what this review is worth. I first listened to Weezer after seeing the Buddy Holly video on MTV. Liked that so much I bought the CD. Loved that. That and Collective Soul's new album ""Hints, Allegations..."" were all I listened to for a while.Then Pinkerton came out, and I bought it without knowing anything about it. I was still very impressed. Moodier, but still resonated with me.Then green came out, and again, I assumed that I would love it. I had heard ""Hash Pipe"" on the radio, and wasn't impressed with it, but figured that the rest of the disc would be better. Well, it wasn't. I can't put my finger on it (although many others have), but it just isn't the same. I mean, Pinkerton was different than blue, but it all sounded like there was a continuity at work. Green just sounded like they stopped caring. I listened to it a few times, then put it away for a few months. Then I listened to it again. Dang, that thing is bland."
3,Not the Greatest,"I, of course wanted this album for two songs and only two songs, ""Island in the Sun"" and ""Hashpipe"". The good part: they are VERY good songs that I still love and never get tired of. The bad part: Uhhhh well I pretty much didn't like any of the other ones, except for the chorus(just the chorus) on ""Smile"". Seemed like they put all their energy into a few songs and the rest were just fillers. I don't especially recommend this album and I think I prefer the Blue Album."
4,Whee!,"I really liked this album. =) It's not really my thing, normally...I'm more into metal. But this kept me entertained. =) I think they could have done better, though. It seems that alot of people favor their first two albums more, so I'll look into buying those sometime, if I can. =)"
2,Disappointing,"This CD might pass as four or five stars for other bands, but I think Weezer fans deserve more after waiting five years for this album.After the amazing Blue Album and the brilliant (though highly underrated) Pinkerton, the Green Album feels like a step back for the band.Most of the songs are just catchy melodies with lyrics empty of meaning and all summed up in a quick 2-3 minutes (where are the ""Only in Dreams"" songs?). The few decent songs: Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, Smile, and O Girlfriend, are mediocre compared to what Weezer is capable of.However, I think that the real problem with this CD is the lack of emotion in the singing and lyrics that made their previous albums so unforgettable. Another big problem is the absense of bass player, Matt Sharp. I never realized how much I missed his great falsetto until I listened to Pinkerton again a few weeks ago.I'll probably always buy albums by Weezer, but I sincerely hope their next effort is a lot better."
3,Average,"Well, I bought this album because of Hashpipe. It was a cool song with the same weezer sound. But you know what, Weezer is not changing and that is affecting their music. Although Weezer is a good band, their music since the self titled blue album sounds the same. Although on their latest there are about, in my opinion, 4-5 songs that actually are decent. Hashpipe and Island in the sun are the two best. It takes more than four good songs to make five stars here on the reviews. In the long run, I was very dissapointed."
4,"Not a Classic, but great for Weezer fans...","Great CD, but not every song is an instant classic which I thought the blue album almost was. But its not a dissapointment"
2,what the hell happened?,"seriously, this album is a huge disappointment. i am a huge fan of pinkerton and the blue album, and this just ... in comparison! rivers supposedly wrote hundreds of songs while away; well, you could've at least put some of the good ones on here! i can only say i like ""don't let go"" and ""photograph"". otherwise, these seem like quickly put together songs all made from a mediocre riff. i'm sad to say it is the most disappointing album i've heard in a long time."
2,ugh...,"weezer's first album was brilliant and creative...this is pure drivel...it's very, very generic and very short...the songs are entirely unoriginal and smack of every other band that's out there today...this is just a poor effort..."
5,A successful retreat,"There are a lot of people who don't like this album because it doesn't have the hard edges or angst of Pinkerton or the fact its only 28 1/2 minutes long. So? Rivers probably felt like he needed to get back on his feet after the Gold ""failure"" (since when is a good album considered a failure?) that was Pinkerton. If he needed to write a poppy, short album that has tons of hooks and reministed back to the ""Blue"" days, fine. The music is still high quality, and Rivers himself said he had written more ""pink""-ish songs and just wasn't ready to release them.And besides, most albums only have 28 minutes (if that) of good music anyway, and the rest is filler. (remember early beatles and some pink floyd CDs? those were short, and some of them are considered masterpieces.) Just enjoy this album now and hope that the next one is longer (and comes out before 2006)."
4,Hee Hee,"I really like the first 5 songs of this cd, but th erest is like.......not good.I wasn't that dissapointed i mean, liking only half of a cd isn't that bad to me. BUY IT!!!!"
4,I'm not a big Weezer fan.. BUT..,"I don't listen to the radio much. So I'm only familiarwith a few Weezer songs. Buddy Holly.. Say it ain't soo.Island in the Sun.I received this disk for Christmas. After listening toit the first time, I was not sure I should have put thison my Xmas list.After listening to the disk the second time. I was muchmore positive about it.I like it a lot. Not my favorite album in all history, butvery good. I like the mix of sounds on the album. Andeven though Islands in the sun was the only song I new byname.. there are other great songs on the disk.Listen to the samples.. Check it out. I was only a very casualWeezer fan.. and I loved it.. you will too"
2,Surprising and disappointing,"When I heard Weezer was finally putting out another album, I was very excited. I thought to myself, if Pinkerton was one of the best albums Ive ever heard, this album must be good. I was wrong. Weezer is yet another band that has given up their roots and isn't using their talent wisely, just like The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Audioslave, and to a lower extent, Blink 182 and Nickleback. So do yourself a favour and dont buy this or Maladroit and stick to the first 2 albums."
4,"Its no Blue album or Pinkerton, but....","Weezer fans waited for many years for the return of perhaps the greatest band in history, only to find disappointment. I am not saying Weezer is no longer a great band, they really are, however the Green Album is no Blue Album or Pinkerton. What do I mean by this you might be asking yourself? I mean that the Blue Ablum and Pinkerton are so much better. For one reason, the previous albums had intelligent lyrics and were not as poppy. I recommend both the Blue Album and Pinkerton over this to the people interested in the old Weezer. Despite its low standings compared to Blue and Pinkerton, the Green album succeeds in being catchy and an enjoyable listening experience, yet it could have been so much better. Overall a disappointing return for one of the best bands ever."
2,Noooooooo!,"Weezer oh my beautiful Weezer what has become of you. I know I may sounds cliche but this is the most dissapointing album I have ever listened to. After the excellent Blue Album and the even better Pinkerton I must have expected too much because most of this album is complete garbage. Lacking is the melodic bass of Matt Sharp, the raw sounds that were so key in the first two albums, and most importantly good lyrics. If Rivers thinks I wanna listen to a song that contains the words ""open your heart and let the good stuff in"" then he might as well just have his band play instrumental pieces."
1,A damn shame,"I love Weezer. I have the blue album, pinkerton, and countless bootlegged cuts and rarities. The GREEN album sucks. The best thing about Weezer is that they somehow tuch you. The Green album is completely shallow.What happened? Is Rivers on Prozac now? What happened to teh cool riffs and the surprisingly deep lyrics? It's just depressing. I'm gonna go listen to El Scorcho."
4,just like the good ol' days,"In theory, a band's career and music should keep on expanding and developing creatively so that they're up to date with the times. Yet as a music fan, I just want a band to stick to their same style that made me love them in the first place. And Weezer does just that on this album. They're good at one thing-- making catchy guitar driven pop songs and so what's the big deal if they continued to do that and gave fans what they wanted. Although the album is a little short, but who says an album has to have twenty songs, with only four of them being good. And one more point: look at all the other bands who decided to go off and be creative (think Sonic Youth and Radiohead)-- they just ended up making 90 minute symphonies of unlistenable noise. So cheers to Weezer for sticking to the old game plan. If you buy this album, you won't be disappointed. And if you think its too short, just push the ""Repeat"" button."
2,Disappointment 101,"Weezer returns with a more polished sound and less energy than either of their other two releases. The Green Album is by far the worst of the three Weezer albums. Tracks like Hash Pipe and Island in the Sun are average, but it seems that Weezer was trying to return to the ""pop-rock"" formula of their highly successful debut album, but here they just don't pull it off. Weezer definitely needs a more raw and rough production sound to display their power. The band has toyed with disbanding over the last couple of years and after hearing this I can honestly say that I would have been happier if they did. Their legacy will be Pinkerton and the Blue Album. Only hardcore completists should buy this. Also check out any of The Rentals cd's with ex-Weezer bassist Matt Sharp, it's some cool nerd rock."
4,it's not easy being green,"If you don't compare it to their debut and Pinkerton, it's a great CD. But you know you just can't help comparing when the blue and green albums look so darn similar."
2,Terrible CD,This CD is by far the worst CD Weezer has compiled. Although it has some catchy tunes...weezer dissapoints with their Junior album.
1,weezer's got me green,"i have to say that this is a very disapointing album by far. with the green album most songs are pretty boring and dull, however they do have some excellent weezer of old on here. Yet there is not enough to make it a worth while album. this is exactly what they wanted to do right now weezer said and i just hope it doen't cary on into their new material which i heard is supposed to be quirkier than their beautiful Pinkerton album. i would wait and listen to a copy of it a couple of times before you go out and buy this one."
4,A solid come-back,"I think Weezer has done what it set out to do with this album. They have reestablished themselves in a rock world that is vastly different from when they debuted. Yes, this album is more pop and commercially oriented than their previous albums. No, the lyrics are not as deep as before. But what remains of Weezer are their essential elements; heavy riffs, deep hooks and skewed lyrics. None of that has changed. With this album, Weezer have put themselves back on the rock and roll map. I look forward to what comes next."
3,"Um, disappointing...","I got this album because I liked ""Island in the Sun"" and while I like it and ""Hash Pipe"" there are about 3 good songs on the album and the rest really get weird. Save your money. For something more worthwhile check out a band like Crowded House."
4,hip hip,"It isnt so bad, on the first listen, i thought that a later song sounded a lot like a previous track on the album, but then i realised that in the mere 29 minutes the CD had finished and was replaying itself. Oh well. Since when did *size* matter? Its not how big or long it is, its how good Weezer works it. This was my first Weezer album to purchase, i was slightly familar with them from the Radio, of course. I bought it on a whim, I like lime green, and all. Anyhow, its fairly good, some of the songs are pretty forgettable. ""Island in the Sun"", ""Crab"" ""Photograph"" and ""Hash pipe"" are always pretty good listens. Its alright."
3,Not the same ol' Weezer,"After school today I drove to the mall and got the CD. At first I wasn't sure if it was even Weezer considering the sound has changed a lot since their older stuff. It's not the same Weezer music but it is still pretty good although I do miss the old Weezer music. The whole album is a lot different from ""Hash Pipe"". Overall I gave it a 3 because it is a pretty good CD. River's vocals shine on this CD and the lyrics are great. Hope you like it as much as i do."
4,It could have been more,"Now the first Weezer album was quite easily one of the best pop albums of the 90's, and Pinkerton just added more to the mix. Listening to their new album, it is easy to love it, because let's face it great pop is great music. But we have waited five years for an album that is just that, great. Nothing amazing, and even though album length is never important to me, I think if you take five years between albums you could amass enough material to at least be 30 minutes, but on this album you only get 28 for your ... dollars. Kind of pathetic but none the less if you are a fan of weezer this album shouldn't dissapoint, and if you are for some reason a new fan, the go for their first album."
4,Big mean GREEN machine!!,"I bought this cd knowing that every other weezer cd was great but I had heard that this was the worst one which I totally disagree! This was much better than maladroit but cannot beat pinkerton and the blue album especially. Anyway, the best songs on this album were Dont LET GO, PHOTOGRAPH, HASH PIPE and ISLAND IN THE SUN. These were great. Dont get me wrong the other ones rock too! So if you are a weezer fan or not buy this cd. Buy it especially if you are in question of buying it. Also buy the blue album, (the best one)!"
5,A Very Excellent Record,"This is Weezer's beach album with very catchy songs. This album is very underrated, there is a lot of beautiful music on this record. This has many many of my favorite Weezers songs, this is probably my second favorite album after their first. ""Don't Let Go"", ""Hash Pipe"", ""Island In The Sun"", ""Simple Pages"" and ""Photograph"" are my favorite songs in the record. For up beat Rock, this is great"
4,"Good, not great","This album is good, not great. It has its songs, and some sjust fall flat on their face. The best songs are:Don't Let Go, Photograph, Hash Pipe and Crab. While this may not be the strongest Weezer album of all time, its still pretty good."
1,no talent,It's absolutely horrendous. Anybody with this preference of music has no taste. If I had the option of giving it zero stars then I would have. Seriously people!!!! Get some sense in ya!
3,Just Not Good Ol Weezer,"Well I have been listening to Weezer since 1994. I loved the blue album, not only because it was a great album, but that all the songs had different melodies, yet each one was great. Then pinkerton came out, which is Weezer's greatest acheivement. Then Green came out. I was dissapointed. It was good, but not as good as weezer could have made it. If i have never heard Blue or Pinkerton, yeah this is an awesome cd, but compared to the other two, its horrible. Just listen to the other two cds and see what i mean"
4,Great Music,"I first heard of Weezer when I saw them perform at the NBC TV show Saturday Night Live. Then I heard my friends talk about the band saying that it's pretty good. I then listened to the album and I wan't dissapointed. Weezer can produce some pretty good music. My favorite tracks are ""Photograph"" and ""Hash Pipe"". Minus one star for the length of the album. Maybe if Weezer could write longer songs and make some more music, they can improve. This band can crank out Real Music from their guitars and percussion. It's a good album but it's only 30 minutes long."
3,Pedestrian effort,"Ok, people... lend me your ears.First off, the length--28 some odd minutes--isn't the problem with this album; the problem is the ubiquity. The whole album basically is the same mid-tempo raunch with little variation in rhythm (or sound), which means many people will be making mix tapes using some of the tunes, whereas previously, we just let the whole thing play.Catchy choruses do not an excellent album make, and while at least half of the songs are singable in the shower, they're not as well thought-out or as interesting as the 'blue album'.""Island In the Sun"", ""Crab"" and ""O Girlfriend"" are completely worthy; you won't feel ripped-off if you buy it, but if you fell in love with their debut, this will seem extremely anti-climactic."
3,only 3 songs the glory,"whoever even had the idea to compare this release to the ""Blue"" album should go and hide. the first three songs kick azz, but all the others lack the energy, out of gas. a very much average release. i expected so much more."
3,Why I like this album,"OK, it's not the original, and it's nowhere near as great as Pinkerton (their best album to date), but it's nice to see that Weezer is back and having fun. This isn't a fantastic album, but it's not at all bad. It just sounds like they were having a good time recording it. Welcome back, guys!"
3,"Good, but there's so much more out there","This album is good. The songs are catchy and well written, and there's nothing bad you can say about it. The only thing is, it's WEEZER, and this should be great. This is a band who's first two albums are classics, and who's B-sides are better than 99 percent of music in the known universe. And as good as these songs are, they're passionless, with little depth. This album is GREAT for about 10 listens, but it loses steam after that. So the four stars are confusing... this is good power-pop, and from a pure analytical standpoint this is a really good album, but when held up against what more innovative bands are doing on today's scene, this is not worth your $."
4,Excellent melodic rock,"While my tastes in the past were a bit more in the metal/hard-rock genre, I've been recently getting into more indie bands. While Weezer isn't an underground band, like, say, Fugazi or Helmet, they definitely remind me of the more melodic bands of the ""emo"" set. This album has a good, mellow aspect, which at times reminds me of a punk take on the Beach Boys. It is a catchy pop-rock album, without ""deep"" lyrics (but not silly ones, either) or too much experimentation, just solid 3-minute tunes. This album has not been terribly well-received by most fans, but I think fans of good melodic rock will enjoy it. Unfortunetly, this CD is only 30 minutes long, and that keeps it from the 5-star mark. Well, there you have it. Another solid Weezer Cd. If you like Weezer check ..."
2,Mediocracy at its best- or worst,"This album was definitely a dissapointment. Weezer is my favorite band ever, but this album is just average. I fell in love with Weezer two years ago, when I purchased Pinkerton and the Blue Album after hearing ""Tired Of Sex"" and remebering Buddy Holly. The Blue Album is a pop-rock masterpiece that I loved instantly, but it took me awhile to get into Pinkerton. But Pinkerton is their best, in my opinion; I love the hard guitar riffs, amazing drumming, and the angst-filled magnificent lyrics. But back to the Green album. The songs sound so alike that it is almost comical, and the relaxed, boring dumming and guitars put you sleep. The lyrics are mindless, radio-friendly blather. Don't get me wrong; it is okay, but just okay. I think until they come back, I'm gonna go listen to Pinkerton."
2,not impressive,"This was my first taste of Weezer's music. Many people I know are huge fans of Weezer so I decided to pick up the green album and I was very disappointed. Although I love the single ""Hash Pipe"" the CD never quite had enough to want me to listen to it repeat times. I have since listened to the blue album and pinkerton which i absolutely love. So if you don't have any Weezer albums I would definately recommend the older stuff before this one."
2,Worst weezer cd by far,"After pinkerton it's hard to follow up with something so good, and they failed miserably. this album is the same boring pop song over and over again."
1,This is another Weezer cd,"Aw man.Sigh. Weezer has sinned against Rock music. This cd was bad. I have nothing else to say except that I'm thouroughly disappointed. Wow, i mean they made two incredible albums and then they just, I don't know what they did but this cd nearly brought me to tears. Tears of anger. Anger because it sounds so bad. For shame Weezer, forshame."
3,Eh,"I personally thought this CD could've been a lot better. They took so long to write it, and then it was kind of a let down for me personally. There are some good songs, but it just runs together and I sometimes can't tell when it's a different song. But It's not so bad, I just can't listen to it on repeat."
4,It's about time this came out!,"I'm a huge fan of Weezer and have been listening to them since the beginning. I loved Pinkerton and was hoping for more of the same, but it's changed. That's not to say it's bad. There are some great songs on there, but it's just not as...cool? as Pinkerton. I can't really think of a way to describe this CD, but listen to the samples if you like 'em check it out. Be warned though, the CD is REALLY short. It's not thier best but it's still good ol' Weezer."
4,Weezer Rules,"I am a huge Weezer fan, and I am definitly pleased with their newest release. It is clear they are returning to the tried-and-true sounds of their first cd. ""The Green Album"" is great, with catchy guitar licks and creative lyrics. However, this cd doesn't quite match the magic produced in Weezer's first album. The songs sound more similiar, and the backing vocals aren't nearly as good. Plus, the cd is short at only 28 minutes long. Only 10 songs doesn't quite cut it. It is refreshing to listen to new Weezer songs after hearing ""My Name is Jonas"" and ""El Scorcho"" for years. Overall, this cd is great. Now that Weezer has entered the music scene again, they will have the oppourtunity to improve off this cd and continue to release quality records."
2,after 5 long years...this is what we get...,OH MAN...ive waited 5 long year for this cd.After 2 masterpieces weezer has failed.this album just misses the mark.there arent really any strong hooks on it.dont get me wrong.its not a terrible album.but it aint good.its dull.on both of their previous albums there was not 1 bad song.this has loads of them.its... alt-rock.this is junk that bands like nine days or sugar ray would put out.a big disappointment.one more thing...the album clocks in at 28 minutes!5 years and 28 minutes is all we get!!!!rivers cheated us!we should at least get 35 for the long wait...
3,Disappointing,"Of all the bands to let us down, it had to be weezer. Without the wussy yin of Matt Sharp to balance out the rockin' yang of Rivers Cuomo, weezer can't effectly create the wuss-rock that they're famous for. I don't know who this new chump with bass chops is, but i'm not digging his style. However, my main problem with this album is the fact that it blends in so well with everything else on rock radio. gone are the thick, fun solos, and the quirky high harmonies. ""Hash Pipe"" is probably the worst offender, with sub-standard chugging guitar, unmemorable harmonies, and why on earth is weezer singing about prostitution in los angeles? People call this a return to the Blue album? not a chance. Pinkerton has much more in common with the Blue album then this Green thing ever will."
4,Weezer (2001) The Green Album,"Rivers Cuomo = Excellence! This is a great return for the Happy, Melodic Riffs of Weezer. For myself, the wait was definately worth it. Island in the Sun, O Girlfriend, Photograph and Hash Pipe are the top songs of the album. As usual, the songs are simple and powerful with good lyrics. I enjoy Weezer because it is straight at you and everyone can listen to it without any nasty lyrics. My 5 year old son and I love the album. Thanks to Rivers and the band!!"
3,good album,"i say good, unfortunately, instead of great. this is a good album. the opening track, ""don't let go"" gets the album off on a good start with those great weezer harmonies and melodies, catchy guitar hooks and the like. it's great. the 2nd track is still pretty good. but the 3rd track, ""hash pipe"", although a pretty good song, in my opinion, is a poor choice for the first single. the rest of the tracks are hit and miss. although there are no bad tracks, there aren't any that will attain legendary status either. this album is definitely a turn back to the old school, first album sound. a good album from a great band that will be appreciated as the others are. but i dare say that when weezer is dead and gone, the green album will not be the first listed on their tombstone."
3,=w=,"good cd, but not nearly as good as the blue album. get both. if you can only get one, get the blue cd. but this is a good cd, too."
5,Cool CD,"I think this cd rocks!! I like their song ""h---h pipe"".Their songs are so cool!! You should get it!!!! Have you ever heard of em'? So get their Cd and maybe Blink -182 too! Adios,amigos.Khatereh"
3,like one continuous song,"I only got into this group a couple of months ago. Though their first 2 albums are really different, I enjoyed/still enjoy them both so much. Lots of great, distinctive songs in there ... I liked the quirky, funny and sometimes depressing lyrics (great combination in my book!) and wonderfully evocative music. Darn catchy. However, this green album's songs all kind of blur together as one long song, with the exception of their three singles (""Hash Pipe"", ""Island in the Sun"", ""Photograph""). I still need to give this album more of a listen, and I'll still always love them, but I'm just a tad disappointed."
3,"not a waste of money, but not a classic either","I had never been a fan of Weezer, or even recognized their music for that matter, until this album was released. So I bought this album and the Blue album. I would say they are both about the same. After listening to both, the only songs I really like are the ones that I had heard on the radio. An average band. ""Island in the Sun"" is very good though."
5,Great CD,This cd takes a few spins (as did Pinkerton) before you really start to enjoy it. It is kinda short but excellent nonetheless. BUY THIS!! Favorite Track: Island in the sun or Photograph
2,"For shame, Weezer.","The day I went down to buy this album I was SO EXCITED. New Weezer: rock on! Saddly, it only lasted up to the point where I put the CD in my disc man. The timer read 28 min. Five years and only 28 min.... It get's worse. I pop in the CD and listen to the first track. What happened to my Weezer? I was heartbroken from the first sub-par chord. The wonders never cease and the album stays in an amazing groove of mediocrity for the span of it's pitiful run. For shame Weezer."
4,"The ""Diet Blue"" album","OK, it's not as bad as many people say it is. Kind of soul-less. But there are some pretty good songs on here, such as Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, Don't Let Go, and O Girlfriend. The best BY FAR is Photograph. Great great song.If you like this, you'll LOVE the blue album."
2,disappointing,"Pinkerton is my favorite album of all time. After waiting...and waiting... and waiting for the next album, I found the poppiness and lack of meaning in the album to be a disappointment. However, there are a few gems on this one. It irks me that the same critics that hated a masterpiece like Pinkerton will love this. I want my Weezer back!"
3,Mediocre To say the best,"After being a fan since the first time I heard 'The Sweater Song' and culminating with the exceptional and much maligned ""Pinkerton"", this cd comes as a huge dissapointment. The songs aren't bad mind you, just boring and lacking much of what the earlier songs had as magic. Sadly, Matt Sharps backing vocals are missing and it shows more than you would think. The songs no longer have the tongue-in-cheek feel of the first two cds, nor the musical ingenuity. The songs are nothing but old hooks played over for the 2 minute duration of the songs. There are high points; ""Photograph"" in particular, but not much elsewhere. I am still a fan, but this cd better just be a glimpse of the new heart and soul of the band and hopefully be the beginning of a newly focused weezer because if this is a final statement, I would have to compare this to a very poorly directed sequel. a'la ""Grease 2."
2,what happened to weezer?,"I loved the blue album and the songs I've heard from Pinkerton. I was really looking forward to hearing this album. I've played this album over and over in my car and at work and at home in hopes that something would grab me from this album. But really, it just sounds like rotton music. What happened to Weezer? Maybe they just need Matt Sharp back. I'm going to sell my copy of the green album and go get Pinkerton instead.And really, where did all this hype over Weezer come from? They weren't even this popular when their music was good."
2,As far as post Matt Sharp Weezer goes..,"I am not a Post- Matt Sharp Weezer fan, but this is and Make Believe are the least sucking out of the late Weezer albums. But seriously, The Blue Album and Pinkerton are all you need of Weezer. If you crave more Weezer- esque material I suggest you turn to The Rentals, that dog., and Fairview (if you can even find them on here anymore, I haven't really kept up but their first CD is really good). All of those bands are not as good as old Weezer, but better than anything Green album on."
3,"not bad, but not great either","i love the person who described this album as the ""Diet Blue"" album, lol. thats exactly what it is. its poppy and catchy like blue, but something is lost in this one. to me, it sounds like weezer put out an album just to put out an album. the passion and love for the music is gone. thats not to say i hate this one. i like to listen to it every now and then, when im in a happy-go-lucky mood (or when i want to be).my personal favorites are ""photograph"", ""smile"", and ""island in the sun"". i mean, how can u not smile when you hear island? it just makes u feel good. anyway, this album is either take it or leave it, not really a must have unless you are a hardcore weez fan. i would pick blue and/or pinkerton instead."
4,a happier weezer,"after the amazing uniqueness of pinkerton that gave us a look into the despair of rivers cuomo, the green album does a 180 and shows us a lighter weezer. i am a huge weezer fan and a lover of all their albums. basically, i was a little confused after hearing the melodic depression of pinkerton and then putting on the poppy tunes of the green album. but it was good confusion- the first two tracks with their feel-good quality makes you see that the boys were just in a better mood when they made this album. I debated whether or not to give the cd four or five stars. it is undoubtedly great and probably more loved than pinkerton, but i miss some of the depth that was lost when cuomo dried his tears. but i remember how great this album is when i listen to songs like ""island in the sun"" and ""don't let go"" that really just make you feel good. it isn't a masterpiece, but it will cheer you up and expand your appreciation for such a great band as weezer."
2,A step backwards...,"There doesnt seem to be any other way for me to sum up this album. The songs are very catchy, but become stale and repetitive and theres a surprising lack of clever lyrics and originality. What disappoints me the most i think, is that this is the only Weezer record that I would classify as ""geek rock."" Weezer have always been superior to the bands that emulate them (Ozma, for example), because they focus on the lyrics, and not style, a quality that they seem to have discarded for their latest release(compare the covers of the blue album and the green one). If you want a real weezer album, get pinkerton. If you want to wear 3/4 length rock shirts and glasses you may or may not need, then this may just be a perfect fit."
3,mediocre,"I have to say, I love weezer. And I mean love. By far my favorite band... but this album is iffy. It's decent for the first few songs, and Island in the Sun is a masterpiece. But then you keep listening... and the dull monotony hits you. Each song has the same atmosphere, the same cheery sound to it, the same vocal-like solos. It's not that I hate the songs, I just hate the repetition. I gave it a 3 because while the songs do sound pretty good, it's not like the old (or new) weezer - there's nothing about it really making it stand out.Still, not a bad album... better than many I hear from other bands. It's full of a ""happy"" kind of mood, but I warn you that it will get really repetitive after a while. It reminds me of the song ""Holiday"" on the Blue Album (the best album ever!), but not in the same unique way. I'd say buy if you have the money, but first get Pinkerton, Blue, and maybe Make Believe."
5,Glorious 28 minute Ramones like effort,"""Where are the introspective, tortured songs off of Pinkteron that changed my life and put me in touch with my feelings and feminine side?!?!?!"" Or so cry those who don't get it. The Green album is pure pop killer. It is as close to an early Beatles album as anyone's managed in the last 30 years. Don't believe me? Then open your ears and check out Photograph, Don't Let Go, Simple Pages or Island In The Sun.The album clocks in at a very Ramones-like 28 minutes.P.S. For some reason Jaan Uhelszki thinks this may be a lost Badfinger album. Ummm... No. Badfinger may have had the harmonies but they surely didn't have the rock."
3,Disappointing,"This album will satisfy all the many critics who loved the first album and hated the second one. If you were expecting to hear the powerful music and meaningful lyrics of Pinkerton, you'll be disappointed like I am. Undoubtedly, there'll be many rave reviews following mine saying ""Weezer has redeemed themselves"", ""The REAL Weezer has returned"", ""Forget Pinkerton ever happened"" yadda yadda yadda. This is the first case I've seen of a band that has grown up, and then grown DOWN. I hate to use a buzzword, but Weezer, one of my favorite bands, has sold out. Now excuse me while I go sit in the corner and cry."
5,Great album from a great band.,"The third great album from the greatest band of the 90s is a wonderful followup to Pinkerton (a very underrated album). If you are looking for the great sound from the first =w= album, this one is for you. The songs will remind you of the original self-titled CD. The three new songs (Hash Pipe, Don't Let Go, Island in the Sun) they played live on the recent tour sound great, and the rest of the album can be listened to over and over. This is an album that will be played constantly in my cd player for quite a while (I can give the blue album a short break). Weezer is back and as good as ever! I just hope they don't take another 4 year break (Rivers has already said they will definitely record a 4th album!!). Add this album to your collection now."
4,Not too bad at all,"Like many of you I went out and bought this cd the day it came out. For the last few weeks I have played the cd a bunch of times, and each time it gets better and better. The first time threw there were only a few standouts, but after I played it a few times the cd got much better to me. Thats sorta how I felt about Pinkerton. It took a few plays for me to realize how good of a cd it was. In my opinion the Blue Album is still there best, but the Green Album really isn't that far behind. Its short and gets right to it, theres no song on here that you need to skip over. And thats the same with all there cds, so if your a Weezer fan, get this cd, its worth it.(I enjoyed there performance on SNL last week)"
4,"Catchy, great!","Weezer is just synonomous with the word ""catchy"". I couldn't give it five stars, however, because I felt that it wasn't as good as blue and ""pink"". Nonetheless, it is a great album with a great, new sound. My favorite track would be ""Glorious Days"". I'd recommend it to any Weezer fan."
3,Not Good Enough,"Just like the last reviewer from Canada, I agree that the first four tracks are good, but from there the whole album seems to fall off. The final six songs really just don't give you anything to hold on to, especially after the first two albums in which every song seemed to capture my attention. The 28 minute running time, after numerous years of releasing nothing is horrid. Everyone knows the amount of material that the band has at their disposal, so why not include some of it on the album? Frankly, the album is still good. The sound is a little different than the previous two, but overall everything is good. To sum this up, my three stars might really be three and a half, but after two spectacular albums, and numerous years of leaving us waiting, the rediculous running time, and the failure of the final six tracks, it just leaves me a little upset, and wanting more."
3,Solid but not stirring...yet,"I always feel somewhat guilty when I can't bring myself to love a really good record. The guilt is setting in. The Green Album is a solid pop-rock album with some great examples of Rivers' songwriting genius, but it feels like a step backwards after Pinkerton. Matt Sharp's absence is palpable...where are the falsetto vocals? And where is the heir to the Sweater Song and El Scorcho? The Green Album is too serious and too short. Another gripe: Pat Wilson has so little to do as a drummer on this album that he starts to sound like Ringo Starr. Pinkerton was great because the songs rose and fell, building, swelling, exploding, and moving musically in all directions to reflect the powerful lyrical themes. The Green Album seems like 10 mediocre pop songs played by a band that is capable of so much more. We all know that Rivers has written plenty of songs over the past five years, but all we get is a 10-song, 29-minute release. It just doesn't seem fair."
4,Not quite essential...,"... But still good. If you have the Taang reissue of Performance, then you don't really need this disc. (Though, I might add, the sound quality is a lot better on this disc.)Basically, it's the last four (and best) tracks off of Performance that didn't make it onto the original release, plus yet another version of the Ecstacy Symphony."
4,Spacemen 3 - 'Threebie 3' (Space Age),"About as good as their 'Spacemen Are Go!' disc (see my review). 'Threebie 3' is a good live concert archive release of a show the band had played in Amsterdam, Holland in February,1988.Track listing: ""Starship""(5:04),""Revolution"" (6:28), ""Suicide""(12:17),""Repeater"" (5:29) and ""Live Intro Theme(Xtacy)""(9:08). I've heard that numerous labels might indeed reissue time after time virtually the same couple of old Spacemen 3 concerts.You might want to keep something in mind,that I have only maybe six or less of their CD's to my name. So,I apparently haven't burned out on them as of yet.Worth checking out."
4,Waiting in the wings,"Edward the VII spent the longest time (to date) waiting to be King. His mother, Victoria, was a Queen who refused to initiate her oldest son & heir in the duties of the monarchy. Her devotion to his father's memory knew no bounds & she certainly didn't want to see anyone else sitting in what she considered ""Alberts place"". After Alberts death she virtually went into seclusion for 30 years. Leaving the English Empire without visable leadership. Bertie (Edward VII) did all that he could to provide that visibility given the restraints of his Mother. Enjoyable look at the pecularities of the monarchy."
3,An ok book for flying nerds,I fly Ultralight and the book is ok to read but every page youfeel how much the author is padding himself on the shoulder.He is for sure full of himself but the book is ok if you have nothing else to read
4,'Must Have' for Elvis Fans!,"This is a 'must have' book for Elvis fans--details little known episodes of the King's life---though localized to Virginia, Elvis fans will appreciate the stories that make us remember why we loved Elvis. Buy it now!"
4,love the smell,I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves the spicy sent and I love to smell it on him as well.
3,tommy bahamma cologne,I do like this cologne.A very suttle fragrance.It just doesnt hold up for long.....but it beats an overbearing one.
5,Tommy Bahama,The item is excellent and has a great smell. A great price compared to what it is sold for in stores.
5,Citrus is out ...!!!,"I've been using this since 2006 and found it a charm !!! . Works since it smells like a man's scent. You will never confuse it for a woman's, like 99 % of all men's colognes out there in the market.Not available at all stores , but I've always found better deals online for them and this is a great price for it too.It may not last long once you spray since it's meant to be subtle and not loud. That is the only blemish one may find with this product."
4,Tommy Bahama (nice but replicas of these other colognes...),"The brown musky one is clearly ""Claiborne Mambo"". The ""very cool"" - think the original Tommy Hilfiger, but a little subtler, with a splash of beach, but its nearly identical, most people will think ur wearing Tommy if they remmeber. The blue one, ""St. Barts"" is remarkably like ""Polo Sport"". The set sail I didn't peg immediately but it too smelled familiar, like Claiborne Sport mixed with CK be, kinda like that Michael Jordan Cologne that came out a few years back. They all have an added touch of that beachy smell like the tommy bahama candles you smell when you walk into tommy bahama. (Unless i was just smelling the candles in the background) I bought the very cool one anyway and when I got home it hit me, crap this is Tommy Hilfiger."
1,Truely disgusting scent,"This stuff smells like musty plywood sawdust mixed with black pepper. Absolutely disgusting, cheap scent. Bottle is made of poor quality glass with lots of bubbles in it.Repulsive, repugnant, vile fluid that follows you everywhere and sticks in your nostrils, causing headaches and closing up your throat. People who enjoy this are surely masochists.Thankfully it's a light scent that stays close to the skin so others won't be disgusted by your odor. It lingers even after scrubbing the areas to which it was applied with rubbing alcohol, laundry detergent and baby wipes. YUCK!"
3,good but not as gripping as the lord ramage novels,interesting book but not up to the standards of the lord ramage novels. had a difficult time forcing myself to finish this book. took me almost a week to finish reading unlike my usual 1 day.
2,Really bad,"Stock characters, stock villains, stilted dialog. The only saving grace is the seminar on the history of Jamaica -- though it is offset by the totally out of place essay on amber-working -- For anyone other than Dudley Pope I would have tossed it aside. Two stars... because Pope has written good stuff."
4,Significant History by Military Iconoclast,"Keegan's theory that warfare is a reflection of the society that fights it, while not a mind blowing revelation for many people, is a significant departure from ""classic"" (Clauswitzian) theorey. What is more, Keegan's theories will more likely be able to stand the test of time than the rigid doctrines of the past. For example, the Clauswitzian model can not support neo-absolutism, information or market warfare, as America discovered in Vietnam and Somalia.Keegan's writing is, as ever, relaxed and lucid and provides valuable insights into not only what war is, but why we fight them."
2,Warfare History Muddle,"In his ""History of Warfare,"" John Keegan does not match the mastery that Victor Hanson displays in ""Carnage and Culture."" Keegan does not convincingly demonstrate that military superiority mirrors larger social, economical, political and cultural practices, which have little relevance to the art and science of warfare. Keegan is not convincing when he attempts to prove Carl von Clausewitz wrong that war is not the continuation of politics by other means. Although Keegan's analysis is sometimes interesting, it is mainly anecdotic and bogged down in detail that fails to capture the target audience."
4,Illuminating,"I'm definitely an amateur where military history is concerned, but this book reads like it would be useful and interesting to neophytes and history professors alike. Without hyperbole, Keegan explores a fascinating and often complex subject and puts it in simple, comprehensible terms. This book is as much a study of human behavior as it is of military history, exploring the impact war has had over the course of human existence, and discussing how in the twentieth century we may have at last outsmarted ourselves"
3,"An uninformed attack on Clausewitz and ""the Clausewitzians.""","An odd book, and possibly the most uninformed attack on Clausewitz and on ""the Clausewitzians"" in the last 50 years. Keegan, author of some wonderful books, has evidently given in to his guilt feelings over his interest in war. Here, he has tried to expiate his politically incorrect sins through a 160-page Germanophobic attack on the famous military theorist, whom he not only does not understand, but appears never to have read"
1,Fish out of Water,"I really couldn't make it through the book. Keegan's strengths are his unusual ability to empathize and the smoothness of his writing. What Keegan does not excel at, however, is theory, but that is the topic of this book.The worst thing about the book is that he made attacking Clauswitz the centerpiece and Keegan doesn't understand Clauswitz AT ALL. Frankly, I was embarrassed for Keegan when I read it. Don't get this book.Two books you should have, if you haven't already got them, are Keegan's ""The Face of Battle"" and Clauswitz's ""On War"". If I had to restrict myself to two books on military history, they would be the two."
3,A basic book for most of us,"Urgently needed by anyone interested in the history of human conflicts. The book will take you to explore the prime factors that motivate human agression which leads to conflicts and commonly widespread wars. The humans basically adhere to invent such warfare precious to their survivability.Not much into the chronology of events, but the theme profoundly makes clear of the whole issue of human warfare. The tools, the reasons, the heritage, and the passions of war blend quite perfectly in this book.Don't buy it unless you hate war enough to know it better and love peace enough to support it."
1,Keegan's Writing Style Makes Reading Difficult,"I have painly read half of this book, and I have decided to give up and look for another book on the same subject. Keegan constantly, with every sentence, engages in digressions, diversions, and tangents. I found it quite difficult to focus on the material. I have read over 50 books in the last 5 years, and Keegan is one of the worst authors I have ever encountered. Reading Keegan is almost like dreaming - erratic, and difficult to remember. Reading Keegan is like hearing every last thought that runs through the mind. I highly recommend against this book."
2,NOT CONVINCING,"THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL."
2,Disappointing,"Keegan tackles a difficult subject, but comes up with little. He seems intend on having a Clausewitzian encounter with the premises of Clausewitz. He tries so hard to prove that Clausewitz was wrong, and it gets tiring. Keegan is also not afraid to make the facts stand on their heads - like his description of site 117. He really wants us to believe that the Greeks invented ""total war"", but neglects other cultures like the Hawaiian that do not fit in with his views. Overall this book was a great disappointment."
2,A disjointed and disappointing effort.,"I found Keegan's ""History of Warfare"" largely disappointing. Although the author succeeds in bringing many facets of ancient and modern warfare to light he fails to provide a common thread. This lack of theme becomes more telling as the book continues. This is particularly disappointing in view of his outstanding earlier works, particularly ""The Face of Battle""."
4,"""light harmony with orchestral blending...soft rock was born","We're looking at the late '60s into the early '70s when music was taking another turn in their musical journey...listening to the radio you could hear the sounds and times changing...this album is justly named from the man who was at the helm ~ Alan Lorber, generated a new phrase ""Boston Sound"" (Boss-Town Sound).Blends of folk, close harmony and loves song themes come through with each lyric...haunting, almost mesmirizing in content as you listen to each track...""OFF WITH THE OLD"", by Chamaeleon Church would be a good example...entire gig of compilations is a blast, need this one for your collection, trust me!Total Time: 73:09 on 18 Tracks ~ Varese Sarbande 302-066-235-2 ~ (2001)"
4,Good game for therapy,I have not played the game according to the directions. Instead it's used more as a therapy tool for my Grandpap who had a stroke a couple months ago. It's a great game to help with hand coordination and problem solving. I knocked off a star be cause the numbers on the top piece are the same color which makes them hard to see. Also the top without the game pieces on it is not totally level.
3,Ok game,My nephew has motor skills difficulty and bought this to help with balance and coordination.He seems to enjoy it.
3,Eh!,"Bought a bunch of classic board games for my six year old for Christmas. To my surprise, this one was not a hit. May be more fun for younger kids."
4,Great game for all ages.,"This is actually our second purchase of Topple - my kids wore the first one out. I'm a mom of 8 and all of our kids enjoy this game, from the high schooler down to the baby, even if the baby just likes trying to stack up the pieces on the floor. Our little kids actually play it more and it makes for a fun and easy game for them. They love stacking the pieces, even if they don't always play by the rules."
3,The Pieces Are Cheap But Concepts Are Good,"This can be a fun game if you have kids that like to crash things (or not!). I bought this to help teach my kids about weights and balance. My 3 year old likes to pile the pieces on one side and watch them crash as he sees just how many it will take for that to happen. He also tries to balance them so they won't fall. That's more of a challenge! The pieces are a bit cheap though. They're made out of thin, light plastic that can break easily. Without any weights on it, it doesn't balance correctly either. As soon as I set it up right out of the box, it leaned to one side. I thought I just didn't have it on right, but no matter what adjustments I made it wouldn't sit right. It's cheaply made. Still, it gets the concept across and we have fun playing with it."
5,Chris from Ashley River Creative Arts El.,Chris Soentpiet's illustrations are GREAT! I love how he made the shadow and the light shining on the people! I love how he drew the people. I love this book because it is EXCELLENT!I give this book 5 stars.
5,I love this C.D.,"I love all of the songs that I sampled but you should sample ""Whylin"". Tyger Hill is the bomb and DJ Butch is definitely ""all that"". I love him."
3,Unusual,"I am a huge Ben Gazzara fan. This movie was unique and different. Ben, as always, was fantastic. Talia Shire was very good. The plot was a little hard to follow, but still an enjoyable movie."
5,"Stars, fashion, gossip, laughter, and tears.","I never got to go to the star studded fashion show extraveganza'a that Mr. Anketell writes about, but now I can via his wonderful book, and be both in the audience AND backstage. Out of tragedy and tears came beauty and joy, and all that is in between, and Mr. Anketell tells it all with humor, pathos, and genuine affection. Kudos! Brava! Encore! A perfect gift."
2,VHS bootleg crud! Think twice.,Don't expect quality.. it's an old VHS dubbed to DVD. Terrible quality.
5,M y favorite children's book...still stands up!,"This charmingly illustrated book was mine as a child of the 1960s and always stayed with me throughout my life. Happily, my mother held on to it and I still have it in my library. It's a magical and memorable book for all ages."
5,Where does the Butterfly go when it rains?,The original book if I am correct has blue and white illustrations. I owned this book until my mother either lost it or sold it for 25 cents at a garage sale. She felt so bad that she bought me the new edition which is beautiful. I am still looking for the original copy of of this book for it is fabulous!
3,highs and lows,"STARS AND BARS provided one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've ever had. Henderson Dores and the befuddlement he felt at the various situations in which he found himself were a constant source of humor, sometimes hilarity, and of admiration for Boyd's inventiveness and style. However,while I'm no prude I found a couple of scenes offensive; sometimes Boyd comes across as a case of arrested development in his need to describe female genitalia. This trait is especially offensive in one particular scene where the context is not sexual and the details are beyond unnecessary. I've since read ARMADILLO, which is also great fun; it also is more substantial and contains less of the prurience. I look forward to reading more Boyd, as he is a top-notch storyteller. However, if he hasn't yet, he needs to get over his distracting little obsession."
1,Cartoon Characters Mar Comedic Novel,"William Boyd's novel about a repressed Englishman trying to break free of his natural shyness and repressive habits is more like a series of set-piece vignettes than a coherent novel. The book has sketches of aggressive New York Jews, tweedy Wasps, evil and dangerous Italians, and impossibly benighted and Gothic Southerners. It's almost as if Boyd gave vent to every nasty prejudice he could mine -- all in the guise of writing a humorous novel. Because his characters' unpleasant aspects are so overdrawn, the resulting characters aren't believable, even in comedy. The only redemptive feature in this otherwise muddy little piece of work is that Boyd has an undeniable imagination, and he manages to write his characters in and out of some funny scrapes. But that strength cannot overcome the novel's fundamental flaw."
5,Fidelio - Furtwangler -Theater an der Wien,"Legendary live performance of Fidelio, even better than studio recording with the same cast. No other performance approaches this."
5,Great Children's Story Bible,"This is a fantastic children's reading bible: pictures are very realistic and well done, typically with kind looks on their faces, and for the most part, the details in the pictures tend to be historically accurate. Highly recommended!"
3,Dickies Flat Front uniforn pants,"I wish I could give these pants five stars, but I can't. They are very well made, but they are cut entirely tooooo small. I don't know if it was this batch of material that cut too small or what the problem was, but the pants didn't fit. My son normally wears a slim size, but I bought a regular size because there were no slims. To my shocking surprize they were too tight--very tight. The pockets were bulging out. A size slim would not have been that tight. Had to return for a larger size. Hopefully, these will work."
2,Dickies Boys 8-20 Flat Front Pant,"This pant is a little old-school. It fits high up on the waist, and is really tight in the waist, hip, and bum area. The legs are fine and slim throughout. I am not rating this high because the waist is too small. A 14 should be 26 or 28 inches in waist, and this was 24. I believe this product should be labeled with the waist size as well. Although the legs were fine in length and fit, I could barely fit into the top part of the pants. I would recommend going with the slim-skinny type of pants by Dickies. They fit at the hips and are hip to boot!"
5,Perfect for sschool,These pants are well constructed and less expensive that the pants that my grands school recommends. This was a great find!
4,Uniform pants,"Great value. Fit and look just like the uniform pants at my children's school, but for a lot less. Extremely happy with my purchase."
5,The only pants that still have knees,"They're pretty crispy when you buy them, but loosen up after a few washes. These are seriously the only uniform pants that don't have holy knees half way through the year. They're tough & make it through the whole year, can even press down to little brother."
5,Great deal.,I needed these to complete a sherrifs costume for my son this past halloween. They fit great and he can wear them to school or out with the family.Great price too.
5,Great pants,Great pants for your over active boy. My son goes all day long and these tough pants are perfect for him.
4,Durable,"I bought these pants for my son as uniform pants because he has put holes in the knees of every other pair(of non-Dickies pants). These are reinforced at the knee and are very durable. My son did not care for them at first because of their stiffness, but he has since stopped complaining. So far (1 1/2 mo. later, they still show no signs of wear and I'm very happy with my purchase. The only thing I'd change is to make it have an adjustable waist. I bought a slim, but to get the right length I had to go up a size and the waistline is too big. Nothing a belt can't help though."
5,works,"am using it for my birds, really works nice for that. I tried several birdbath heaters they just didn't do the job. I't been very cold here, so far my birds are very glad I bought it. and so am I."
4,worked great all winter,I bought this bowl at the begining of the winter. I was expecting another very cold winter like last year. Well that did not happen. We did have several below freezing nights. This bowl worked everytime. My dogs like to chew things but the metal around the cable prevented them from doing so. The cable was also long enough to run up the side of the house to my window where I plugged it into a heavy duty extension cord. My only complaint would be it is not big enough. I have three dogs and work 12 hours shifts. They would have it all drank when I got home if the weather was milder. It would be easy enough to buy another one. But now that the chance of prolonged cold weather is gone I am not useing it. I will probably buy another one next year just to be ready. It would be nice if a company could come up with one that was also a self waterer. I know there would be several hurddles to make that work.
1,Worked One Month!,Do not buy this water bowl! This is obvious not heavy duty electrically constructed. Worked fine for ONE month only then stopped working. Worked just long enough so I can not get a full refund. That's so bad. This purchase was no laughing matter.
1,It's not getting warm,"I plugged it in and it didn't get warm so i put water in and it didn't freeze because it's not cold enough yet , but the water was ice cold. Is it broken or is it only supposed to make sure the water doesn't freeze?"
2,Used to make a great chicken waterer.,"I bought this to use for my six chickens as an alternative to an $80 heated poultry fountain. So far it is working perfectly. My dog's water dish has been frozen every morning this past week or so (she's an indoor/outdoor dog though so she gets water inside also) but the chicken's water has not frozen at all. I am very happy with this product so far. I will come back and write more about my experience with it as the winter season progresses.*update 1/16/12 - The temps have been in the low 20's to upper teens overnight for the past week or so (not counting wind chill) and the water in the heated bowl has been frozen every morning for at least a week now. I don't know why it is freezing since it was designed to keep the water thawed, but regardless, it is not doing its job and as is, it is completely useless to me. Guess I'm going to have to buy that $80 heated poultry fountain after all. *sigh*"
3,Great until -degrees,"We ordered this bowl for our chicken coop. It does a great job until the temps get in the negatives then it freezes up. We were looking for something to always keep water from freezing but the heat in the bowl isnt strong enough to the negatives. I would buy again, but will look also for something stronger for the really really cold nights."
4,So far so good,"My dogs spend about 50/50 in/out so it is good to have water out there for them in the winter. It doesn't get warm, but keeps it from freezing, but when you get into the minus temps it will freeze over. So keep that in mind."
2,Disappointed,I bought this for our ducks during the winter I was very excited to find a heated water dish for such a low price and saw that it had good reviews. I was very disappointed that ours does not keep the water from freezing. It does slow it down so they have water longer during the day but I still have to go out daily and remove the ice from the top and add more water. I only gave this 2 stars because it really has not worked for us..
1,wrong platform,"I ordered ""Adobe Acrobat Professional 8.0 Upsell Standard to Professional"" for Mac OS X. Instead I received the upgrade version for Windows."
3,"Great game, poor quality","Its a great game, much more challenging than the standard mastermind. The quality of the board and pieces are very poor, though. Many of the pegs don't fit in to the holes properly. The poor quality still allows one to play the game, so buy it unless you can find another advanced version."
1,Very displeased,"Actually, we love the game very much but are very disappointed with Pressman Toys. Here's the scoop: our game came with only 20 pegs of each color -- the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color. We've called the company 1800 800-0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs. Just bad business practice in my opinion. As the saying goes, when you love something you tell a few people, when you're not happy you tell everyone. I'll be sure to check that I'm not buying items from Pressman Toys next time. So instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we'll just have to win in fewer steps. SIGH!!"
4,good game as expected,"I know this game since when I was a kid, and I have recently bought it for my 8 year old son. The game really makes you think through different possibilities, matching them against the ""response"" pegs of your opponent. The quality of the pegs could have been better, and the number of the white and black pegs is just about enough, which are minor drawbacks of this edition.I suggest to buy this game rather than regular 4-peg mastermind, since you can always play it with either three-peg or four-peg combinations if you want to make it a bit easier for the kids."
3,A fair movie,"This is just a fair movie.The copy fair as well.Not a clear,crisp picture, but not bad.It's watchable.Audio could be better too.This is not a comedy, but it does have some funny parts.But,I am a fan of Hill/Spencer, so I feel it is worth the money. It is dubbed in English.This is the only copy of this movie available for dvd (I think)."
1,Yikes.,"Loving these guys,Terence Hill and Bud Spencer,movies,I wanted more.Picked up this one.Big mistake.There is just nothing going on here at all.I have the Trinity movies,Watch out we're mad,Crime Busters and I'm for Hippo which are a laugh,that both me and my son loves to watch together.So if you like those,there is nothing like them in this one,sorry.Avoid at all cost.Liked the medusa like hair on the lead lady though,hence my on star."
5,Zupreem Monkey Chow,My Sammy loves Zupreem . I like how they made the nuggets smaller and easier for him to handle and a lot less is wasted .
5,Must-Have Parrot Suppliment,"Though these biscuits are made for primates, they are an excellent source of protein and vitamin D for PARROTS. (Vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium, of which most domestic birds need a LOT!) Larger parrots can eat it dry. Most all birds will eat it moist (not soggy!)"
3,"Not too bad, would have been great years ago","If C-12 was released four or five years ago this game would have been considered revolutionary, but sadly C-12: Final Resistance showed up for the dying (but still kicking) PS1 too little too late. The storyline is nothing original (you play as a one man army mowing down hordes of alien enemies hellbent on destroying humanity in a post-apocalyptic future), but the action is well done, and the controls are pretty decent. Graphics are a bit of a setback here though, polygon drop out is aplenty here, not to mention some of the enemies look a little ridiculous. All in all however, C-12 isn't a bad game at all, it just showed up at too late a time. Next-generation only gamers will have no interest in C-12, but if your still holding on to your PS1 (or if thats the only system you own) you'll have a bit of fun with this, and fans of the Syphon Filter series will dig it as well."
3,C12 - Minimal Resistance !,"The general game play for this title is reasonable and there are some good problems to solve. However the game is made infuriating by the load/save methods used and the fact that you have to reload the last position each time you get killed. It would be better if you automatically went to the last save point, rather than having to go through tiresome procedure for reloading a saved file."
4,Had it for years now,"Cool bag cool color = cool fisherman. Seriously though I use it for my bass rigs and mostly fly fishing reels, leaders, and well...flies. Somewhat of a weird configuration with the compartments and all but otherwise perfect."
2,Please Read before purchasing- This bag is not for everyone!!,I apparently didn't read the dimensions of this product well enough. It is much smaller than I imagined. There is no where to store any long clamps for hook removal. The storage trays are very limited on the size and shape of what you can fit in there.(The rows are all the same with-- no larger compartments in them). And if you remove a tray from the bottom to get to your tackle the bag flops over because there is no support.. I really would not recommend this product especially if you change lures multiple times during your fishing trip. Maybe I can sell it on ebay and get some of my money back.
2,Way too small,"I have a bigger version of this box which holds everything I have. It was on its last leg so I wanted a new one. Bought this one, it looked good in the picture, when it arrived, I opened the box and only had to laugh at myself for spending $35 on something that doesn't hold half of my tackle. It wasn't even close. Don't know what to do with it and still in need of tackle box."
1,"Not Waterproof, Straps broke","When I first used the Keeper to drive from Baltimore, MD to Indianapolis, IN, it worked great. No rain got in and it stayed on my roof the entire time. Then I took a road trip from Bloomington, IN to Asheville, NC and not only did the contents get wet during a storm, but one of the buckles broke! Now it is completely useless!"
1,Cargo bag is NOT WATERPROOF!!!!,This product says it is waterproof but actually isn't. We travelled twenty hours to Florida and 2-3 hours of trip was a downpour. Everything in it was soaked. I made the mistake of putting my $600 camera and video camera in it. Water got through the cargo bag and through my video camera bags. All of our clothes were soaked and had to wash when we got to hotel! I would never buy again and I wish I would have spent more money and bought a hard plastic one.
1,NOT waterproof!,"A friend advised me to get this for our trip to TN. We both got one, and we both arrived with wet luggage and clothes. We're both returning it."
2,great yet price is too much compare to walmart,"went to walmart today andfound out that they sell the same exact one for half price.it is good waterproof but hard to put it up on my car roof.won't buy it again, too much trouble to return. so I regret this buy."
4,Worked as described,I have compared several cargo carriers and this one was the best deal. It was reasonably priced and did what it was supposed to. I would not hesitate to buy it again. Good product and shipped fast.
3,Not so waterproof,"We filled this with baby clothes, drove it 625 miles from Oklahoma City to Denver, CO. It rained at least half of the trip and when we got home it had a lot of water inside, clothes were soaked! We'll still use it when its not forecast for rain. The straps are easy to use, and worked great. Also, mine did not look like the picture, it had red were the straps attach to the bag."
4,tough bag,"I moved from Fairbanks, AK to Juneau, AK and it held up perfectly! It was -35 degrees F in Fairbanks so I packed the bag in a garage to get it zipped up and strapped down. Stayed on the Jeep for 6 days..drove through lots of snow and very cold temperatures in Alaska winter. No rips! Tough bag! I put a strap over it just in case and probably didn't need it. I also did not over stuff it in case the cold make it too brittle. I cannot believe the reviews I read on this bag and thanks to everyone who wrote one! Glad I bought it and will be using it many more times. Safe travels!"
1,One use bag...,"We purchased this bag for a 1800+ mile trip to Disney World and back. We had a large suitcase, a medium sized suitcase, a small suitcase, and a medium sized drawstring bag stored in the bag with very little room to spare. The bag was very easy to attach to our roof rack and required no additional restraints. We encountered heavy rain for a good portion of our trip. Luckily, not one drop made it into the bag while driving (80+ mph) or while sitting overnight in the rain as the bag had small tears in the front corners as if it had worn from years of use. The zipper also broke on the way home. Thank goodness I had packed the duct tape...I do not recommend this bag. I will gladly pay a little more for a better quality bag next time."
5,Ideal,"I bought this bag just before making a trip to Orlando, Florida from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It fit very well on top of my Jeep Patriot and was a snap to load up. It easily accepted too large duffles and two smaller tote bags with room to spare. It strapped down quickly and securely to my side rails. The entire trip down was uneventful, The cargo bag did not shift and there was no noticeable wind noise. It was easy to unpack and fold up on arrival. The trip back to Myrtle Beach had us driving through heavy rainstorms. There was no leaking at all. I believe that it is just a matter of carefully attaching the velcro strips on the rain flaps and folding the flaps over. This is an excellent product at a great price. I highly recommend."
2,Straps broke on first trip,"I had high hopes after reading all the positive reviews. Maybe the product has changed since the previous reviews. The first time I used this bag one of the 4 sections of the bag where the straps are attached to the bag broke off. The color in the photo shows 4 sections where the straps are attached to the bag (in black). The bag I received had orange sections where the straps were attached to the bag and are apparently glued on to the bag because once section came off. We were still able to use the bag with the remaining 3 sections attached to our vehicle, but no telling when/if the others might break as well. Unfortunately I bought this item 2 months prior to our trip and it's too late to return it for a refund. I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you only need to use it once or twice, or unless you don't mind using a different method to attach it to your car. (i.e. straps that aren't attached to the bag but are able to hold it down)"
3,Not really waterproof,"I just purchased this cargo bag and, on the way to the Jersey shore, it rained and it rained hard. The front of the bag, in the inside, was a wet but fortunately I have most of the items in oversize ziploc bags and nothing was damaged. I do not recommend it if you are going to use it when snows or when you know it will rain unless you put you itens in waterproof bags (like ziplocs). I also recommend to purchase ""Master Lock 3060DAT 12-Foot-by-1-Inch Lashing Strap, 2-Pack"" for additional protection."
2,I expected better based on the reviews.,"I really wanted to like this product and be able to use it at least one more time. Nope that didn't happen. Its 218 between Los Angeles and Fresno and somewhere in between my Keeper 07203 had torn a hole in the corner. The bag was not overloaded, nor was I driving the speed of sound to cause it to tear open either. Fortunately the hole did not grow in size and my stuff made it back home. It's just unfortunate that I had to throw it in the garbage instead of refolding it up and look forward to another adventure with it. Save your money and keep looking. Bummer."
3,Pretty good,Not completely waterproof like others said. We drove through 4 hrs of very hard rain and some of our stuff was pretty wet. But overall a good buy.
4,Keeper 07203 Waterproof Roof Top Cargo Bag,"We needed a Top Cargo Bag to give us extra room in the car for our beach trip. We wanted one that was soft so we can store it easy when not in use. The Keeper Cargo Bag had several negative remarks about leaking so I was skeptical but decided to go for it given the reasonable price. This keeper really helped us with space and we were able to bring everything we needed without taking two cars. Also it did rain coming and going on our trip and the keeper did not leak at all. So I was very happy about that. We also purchased more straps for extra security, but ended up not using them and relied only on the straps provided. Another family member taking the same trip, also bought this Keeper Cargo bag, and for whatever reason didn't even fill it up to the maximum capacity, which I read could be damaging but it was not and also theirs did not leak during the rain. For our family, this Cargo Bag was worth the price we paid and it gave us the space we needed."
5,excellent,"We've gone 2 years with this carrier so far. Wind and rain conditions, and it continues to hold up great and keep our items dry."
3,Get what you pay for,I gave this product three stars based on its value. It served its purpose but the wind noise was awful and it leaked in moderate rain. I would probably not purchase again nor recommend it unless road noise doesn't bother you. I also wouldn't solely trust the attached straps. I supplemented with several ratchet-style tie downs.
4,Great value,"Used this cargo bag for the 2800 mile round trip drive between Chicago and Naples, FL. I found the bag to be a great value considering its price. It is water resistant, not water proof so know that going in. During regular rains we encountered it held up perfectly and all cargo was dry. We did go through a torrential, sustained rain which did result in some slight water accumulation inside the bag but that was expected given the severity of the storm. Tip: pack soft items (clothes) in a garbage bag before putting them in the rooftop bag. Overall, it held up great except for a split in the seam on the front facing zipper cover. The split was repaired with a bicycle tire patch and it's ready for its next adventure. Giving it such high marks as it is a great value considering the price and how well it held up and performed. Highly recommended."
5,Perfect for our needs,"We bought this to go on our 2011 Sienna and it fits perfectly. We put all our bulky items for five, like sleeping bags, clothes, and pillows into it for our camping trip. Really easy to secure to rooftop and well made. We didn't have to drive in the rain but if installed properly, with all flaps down, I'm confident that our items would remain dry.We picked this over a hard carrier for several reasons. Cost, storage capacity, flexibility, ease of installation (easy to take off and on) and ability to store compactly when not in use."
2,cheap material,"On the first trip I made using this bag (a 4-hour drive), the material wore down and small holes developed beneath the straps."
3,It ripped,On our first trip a corner ripped. We moved from Turlock CA to Santa Maria CA. and one of the corners ripped open. My husband is not very impressed with it's performance. We only traveled 4 hours south. We did go on the I 5 at speeds of 75mph. So it is OK.
2,You get what you pay for.,"While this is about the only waterproof, soft carrier out there, the straps shirred within the first 250 miles. Poor quality. One and done use."
2,Disappointed on quality,We used this carrier on a trip from Michigan to Florida and it didn't hold up. When we finally arrived at our destination I discovered there were a few spots on the carrier where it was ripping at the seam and this was the first time we had used it. I have submitted a refund with Amazon and will have to try a different product.
5,Cross Country Move,We moved cross country from CA to VA using this cargo bag and it was wonderful additional packing space. It was completely waterproof as we were chasing storms the whole way. The only complaint my husband had was the straps and attatching it to the roof of the suv is time consuming and kind of a pain. We ended up buying some different strap downs part way through our trip. I would totally recommend this product to anyone who needs additional packing space. This cargo bag saved our lives as we were traveling with our 2 dogs and they took up most of the inside of the vehicle! I don't think you could get a more affordable product.
3,"leaked a little, use some fleece blankets.","I purchased this with the recomended mat and was so glad to have them on our trip from Seattle, WA to southern CA. I was careful to put the zipper towards the back like the instructions say and fold down the rain cover for the zipper. However, rain still got into the cargo bag. I had put 2 fleece blankets on the inside of the bag before I filled it, so that kept all my stuff safe. Also, some of the straps were sewn onto the bag backwards, so instead of the straps falling to the back and side to go around the roof rack, they both laid towards the middle of the bag. It was still usable, just irratating. But the bag worked okay and I am glad to not have to store or buy a big hard roof top cargo container. We will keep it and use it again."
4,Lots of extra space.,"This cargo bag worked great for our trip to NY ADX. Lots of space - held 4 duffel bags (all our clothes) and extra items as well. Instructions are listed only on box - no pamphlet. Took a few minutes to find but easy to use. Didn't run into any rain so I can't comment on that. Heavy duty construction. Before pulling away, make sure the excess nylon straps are tucked in securley or better yet, tied up so you don't hear the ""tap, tap, tap"" as you embark on your journey. Can get a little anoying. Over all I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Very good cargo bag,"The bag worked very well, kept all of our items dry even while driving through rain and a bit of snow. I would definitely recommend this cargo bag.The only complaint I have is that the picture of the cargo bag didn't represent the actual bag I received. The bag I received was in fact black in color, not green as the picture shows and also had the word 'KEEPER' written in bright yellow 3""-4"" letters across the front of the bag. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
2,"Item should be called Water resistant, not water proof.","Installed unit in a roof rack on top of my Forester using directions provided. We ran into a moderate rain storm for just over an hour and the product managed to not hold up as intended and items in the bag were nice and wet. Product should be called water resistant not waterproof. A perfect fix would be a second zipper or something around the bag to seal the zipper cover flap down. The Velcro provided just doesn't do any good. On a positive note, it does secure down nicely on my vehicle rack and items made it to the destination. I suggest looking elsewhere for a better item unless you plan on traveling in dry weather."
4,"great for storage, not really water proof.","We got this just in time for the holidays. the extra space was just what we needed, but the first time we used it some of our it may not have been totally stuff got wet? over all though we are pretty happy with it. plus it is very easy to store since we don't need it all the time."
5,Worked Great!,"This worked exactly as we hoped it would! We have an SUV, but with 2 young kids that need about a million things each for a week at the beach, we didn't have room in our trunk. We loaded this rack up with a pack and play, big graco stroller, beach cart, beach bag, towels... a ton of stuff. We basically just had our clothes in the trunk of the car. The bag zipped shut and stayed put. It rained the whole way home from vacation and nothing got wet. We did also purchase a mat for under the bag, not sure if this was necessary or not, but we figured why risk it? We'll be using this for every vacation."
3,Dependable rooftop with some cons,"Little hard to put stuff in it. It looks big but can accommodate not more than 10-12 small kids stuff.Its not aero-dynamic, it may make some noise,if the straps are not tightened.Its not too bad , if you need more space for your extra stuff that can go in this roof top,I may use it again,if required."
5,Exceeded Expectations,"This is a great value and a wonderful product. I hesitated in buying it initially thinking it wasn't going to serve my needs. Well, it exceeded my expectations. During a 14 hour road trip, we drove through pouring rain and found our stuff to be completely dry. The water did not even touch the inside of the bag. It holds very well on the top of the car. I am happy that I made the decision to pick this one."
5,great product for the price,"I bought this product after an unsuccessful attempt to purchase a hard cargo carrier for my Infiniti EX 35. As I found out the permanently placed crossbars are only 19 inches apart and hard carriers won't fit. Even though this cover is a fairly large size, I was able to fold it to where it would fit in this small space. Because of the way it was folded, I think it made the tie downs a little more difficult to secure. Once it was in place, I rolled the loose tie down straps and taped them with duct tape to keep them from flapping in the wind. We went through a short but severe rain and the luggage remained dry which was my main concern. I'm very pleased with this cover and now I can just fold it up and put it away and I don't have to worry about storing a big bulky hard cover."
4,Worked pretty well,"We took the Keeper 07203 on a 10 day, 2000 mile trip. It was easy to install, and I would say about 98% waterproof. We got a little water in it while driving through a thunderstorm, but not enough that anything in our bags got wet. The only problem we had was after loading and unloading 4 or 5 times on our trip a couple of the velcro tabs that hold the flap down over the zipper pulled off. Overall it worked well, and is a good carrier for the price."
1,Leaked!!,"I purchased this waterproof carrier top to haul clothing, pillows, blankets, air mattresses etc. to our new home. We had a there day travel to get there and then stayed in a hotel a week before our home was ready to move in.Upon arrival we unsnapped, un-velcro'd and then unzipped the carrier to find our belongings inside soaked, moldy, and ruined! After 9 days of rain and heat the interior items were ruined.I bought this to make travel convenient and to avoid having to buy things while we waited for movers, and what a waste of money it was. I will be complaining to company and if they make it right, I will amend my review."
2,Poor gas mileage,Made a trip Oklahoma to Orlando and spent almost $300 one way in gas and knew that was too much because we went to Orlando several times in the past and it was around $200 in gas one way. So on the way back we did not put the cargo carrier up and sure enough it was only $195 in gas on the way back. So beware the extra room you may get because of the cargo carrier will come at a cost. For me it is not worth $100 each way just for some extra room in the minivan.
4,Good choice,The product performed as advertised. We drove through the tornado weather in the South a few weeks ago with heavy rain. Our luggage was a little wet upon arrival but I would expect that any prodcut would perform in a similar manner in those conditions. The item is durable and easy to attach to any roof rack (we have a Toyota Sienna).
5,Great Product,"Our son and daughter-in-law borrowed ours for a trip to Massachusetts from Maryland. It poured the whole 450 mile trip. When they arrived, everything was bone dry. Easy to load and tie down. Definitely worth the money and more."
3,Decent for the price but not 100% waterproof,"We purchased this top carrier for a family trip and tested it last weekend. Some comments...Pros:- great price- easy to install and very solid once installed- a lot of space for bulky items- easy to deinstallCons:- Not waterproof!- straps are annoying until you get the hang of making them tight and rigig- not theft proof so you'll have to deinstall when you get to hotelOverall, it was a decent purchase and we will use it to carry our drysacks or gear that is not water sensitive."
5,Great Product,"We used this to take a 5k trip to Texas. It is a great product. We drove through snow, sleet, high winds and a frog drowning two day rain. It kept everything dry.We used nylon bags for our clothes and absolutely nothing got even damp. I can't say how impressed I was with the performance of this product. It takes one or two timesto learn the best way to load the bags in it but before the trip was over my teenagers were doing it. One note. Be sure to tie the extra tie downs together. Lose they slap and snapin the breeze. Really a great value."
5,Great product,"Love this bag. My dad and I drove from GA to PA, a 12 hour drive. And of course, the weather channel called for rain. We were in hours of rain. I told my dad if my belongings were dry after that 12 hour drive, I would write a review, so here I am. I have a roof rack with center bars. The bag fit right in the middle. We packed it tight. Tied down nicely, minimal flapping noise from the straps. AND best of all, all of our belongings stayed dry after being in hours of rain. I definitely recommend this product."
5,Great product!!,"I took the family on a 1000 mile trip from Florida to Ohio. I bought this product and the matt that goes under it, and the bag didn't move an inch!!! I was able to place 1 large suitcase , 2 duffel bags, 3 pillows, 2 large leather coats and 2 xmas presents- 2 med boxes in the bag. I went through rain, sleet and snow and everthing was dry when i go there. The noise from the straps was minimal, and was kind of reassuring that the bag had not blown off. The matt is very important, as it keeps the bag in place and keeps it from stratching the top.I highly recomend this product."
5,Versital and functional,"I ordered this product last minute before a rainy road trip. I was looking for a rooftop carrier that would accommodate the family luggage for our six day trip and free up interior space in our Mazda MPV. The carrier arrived the next day in a very small box; I was concerned about the size of the product initially. However, the size was not an issue after installing it on the roof rack . Our 22 inch suitcase and three medium sized duffel bags fit comfortably inside. The straps were easy to adjust and the rubbery case material molded close to our bags making the wind noise minimal. Bugs were easily washed off the case in the rain so it was clean upon arrival to the camp siite. A surprise utility was to use the carrier as our dry food storage locker at the campsite to keep rain and critters out. I highly recommend the product for its design, utility and quality."
2,Not Dependable,"I took a trip to Denver and back from Salt Lake City.I secured this Cargo Bag on the roof of my Mini Van.I loaded it with bags.By the time I got back to Salt Lake City The materal of the bag had Torn in several places.My trip was 1,000 miles roundtrip.I hope people do not think this bag will last very long for the Money."
4,Good Size and easy to use,"I used for a family camping trip last week. It holds all our sleeping bags, air bed, pillows, towels etc.At beginning, I thought the strap looked too thin, but they hold the load very well.To make it real water proof, put the side without zipper in front. When it was raining heavily, and you were driving on highway, even a little gap between the covered zipper will let small amount water goes in."
5,Better than expected,WOW - this holds alot - we even had extra room. We will pack more in the carrier next time. We are using this on camping trips. It rained and everything stated 100% dry. The straps work wonderful. I can't stay enough about this product!
4,Very Good Product,"I bought the Cargo bag for a trip to Disney in December and it comes as advertised. We loaded multiple bags and even a small hard sided piece of luggage without any problems. Since we departed from MA where it was cold the bag was easy to manuever even in the cold weather. Setting the straps was easy enough, had to set all 8 (two per side) and then go back around to snug them down. We even drove through a few downpours down and back and nothing even came close to getting wet.Would have given 5 stars if the staps had been a bit easier, but overall a great purchase and would recommend to anyone to buy."
3,"Great bag, horribly annoying straps","Pros:-good size, fits a lot of your stuff but not too much-weatherproof, rain at 80mph for 2hrs didn't get in-easy to pack-seems very durable (and so far so good)Cons:-the straps are ridiculously hard to adjust which you need to do when switching to different cars and should do when you have more or less stuff in the bag. It's bad enough that we are no longer using it unless we have to and are looking for an alternative.I gave it three stars because for the price, the bag is awesome. It might even be worth it for one long trip (say, cross country move) or using rope to tie it down. I know, it sounds crazy that tying with rope would be easier but that's how annoying those straps are!"
4,Worked great over 600 miles,We bought this for use on our vacation about 300 miles away. Loading it up was simple and it holds quite a lot! The buckles are secure and seem durable so far. The only complaint I have is that the triglide slides for adjusting the straps were not oriented the same direction and neither were the clasps. That was easily fixed by pulling them off and flipping them over and reinstalling. Unfortunately I had to do that in 30 degree weather. The items inside stayed dry as we drove through rain and nothing shifted. I prefer this bag to a hard top carrier as I can fold this up and put it in storage when we are not using it while taking up minimal space.
2,Worn on one trip.,"I drove from MN to Texas. It stayed put nicely. We didn't have any inclement weather. When I removed it when we arrived, There were already worn holes in it. I didn't bother using it on the return trip. The worn spots happened on the bottom side. I didn't have anything sharp or with hard edges in it. The hardest thing would be the corners of a duffle bag and a pair of boots."
4,Great for the price!,"We used this on a 6-7 hour road trip. We got a small amount of rain on the way, and the cargo bag did leak a little. However, we had a tent on the roof rack as well, and think this contributed to the leaking. We will try it again without the tent. Lots of room for your cargo that's for sure!!"
2,Stress crack left my items exposed to the elements,"I installed this the night before leaving. To be honest, I did not inspect the item thoroughly. But when I got to my destination a few hours later, and I did not over pack it, there were stress cracks all along the front and looked awful. Water was getting all over my luggage. This was only after 12 hours and one use of this product. I do not recommend this product."
2,The luggage carrier leaks!,"I purchased this luggage carrier bag for a 1000 mile trip, and based on the reviews I read. I made my purchase decision based on the fact that it did not leak. It rained most of the trip but was not a hard, driving rain. Upon arrival, we discovered ALL our luggage to be wet. I wouldn't recommend this anyone!"
4,durable,"This worked out well for us on a 200 mile trip. It was very durable, and held up great. We did not have any bad weather, but I believe it would have kept the elements out. It has a very strong zipper, and a velcro flap that goes around the zipper. I would recommend this product."
4,Just what I expected!,"I was looking for something durable and inexpensive, this certainly meets the criteria. We have used it more than a few times and has protected our suitcases from the rough weather."
4,Worked well on our 2010 Honda CRV,"Purchased this cartop carrier primarily for our visit to see family for Christmas, but also knowing with a dog and a baby on the way, there will be plenty of opportunities for use. Used this successfully on our 2010 Honda CRV, was able to fit 2 carry-on sizes suitcases and a dufflebag, and probably could have fit one more small bag.I would definitely recommend purchasing some type of ratchet straps for additional securing to your vehicle. The included straps are difficult to adjust, and I went for additional security with seperate straps. Seems to live up to its weatherproof claim as we drove 1200 miles roundtrip through several days of snow and nothing was wet."
1,"NOT a ""keeper!""","We used this once for our vacation from TN to Myrtle Beach, SC. About halfway through our 350 mile trip to SC, two of the straps ripped off. Additionally, we drove for about an hour in rain. When we got to our condo, all the luggage on the bottom was soaked! We had to purchase ratchet straps before leaving the beach to secure the thing for the journey home. This is definitely going back! What a waste of time and money!!"
2,Keeper Waterproof roof top cargo bag,"I bought the keeper waterproof roof top cargo bag in January for our trip to Florida in February. We drove from Macon , Georgia to Orlando, Florida in the hard rain. The rain did not stop the whole time and when we arrive in Florida to unload our luggage, the luggage was wet and also the clothes in the luggage. We made sure that the flaps covered the zipper and it did not stop the rain from getting in the waterproof cargo bag."
3,Did not work great in rain storm,"We love the flexibility in this carrier and if it's not raining it's great, but when we headed to Atlanta from Jacksonville with our first use we hit some pretty nasty weather and although everything was installed as it should be some of my daughters new books got water damaged and they were stored in a suitcase. I would say be careful of what you put in it if you don't know what kind of weather you'll be heading into otherwise it's a great carrier we've now used on the ATL to JAX trip twice now."
3,compare price and quality,Will install shortly so far have not used it but in the next few weeks will set on top or rack.
5,Excellent Waterproof Bag,I used this bag to transport my clothes across the country and it worked great. It was on top of the car for 2 weeks. I hit some huge rain storms and everything inside stayed dry. No damage to the bag on the drive either. A great purchase!
5,Great product,"I was seconds from buying a similar Thule cargo bag that could not guarantee keeping out the rain. This product got the job done at a fraction of the cost. It is extremely durable and kept everything perfectly dry. I purchased the Sherpak SuperMat Roof Mat, which I think added to the stability as well as prevented any scratches from dirt on the roof of our Jeep Liberty."
4,It really is waterproof!,"I bought this cargo bag for a trip to Ft Lauderdale, FL and because of the sudden rain showers down there I needed something that would really be waterproof. We went through a couple of showers on the way down but the real test came on the way home. It rained so hard I almost had to pull off the road. I was really wondering if the bag would hold up and it did. When we got home and unzipped it...not a drop of water was inside! The built in straps were easy to attach to the roof rack and it stayed in place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought it would hold more. We had a medium suitcase and a rolling duffel bag but couldn't fit a 2nd medium suitcase in there (the bag wasn't tall enough). We were, however, able to put a lot of smaller items and bags in there so it made up for it. It's a very thick, durable material and I look forward to using it again. I would definitely recommend it!"
5,Worked Great!,We have only used this cargo bag once but it worked great! We got it for a camping trip because it was supposed to rain... and rain it did! It stayed on the top of my suv without any slipping(for a 6 hour drive)and everything stayed dry. I didn't fit as much as I thought I would but I think I will get better at packing it over time. Overall I would recommend to anyone who needs to put extra stuff on the roof.
3,Not waterproof - puddles in the bag,"I read through all the reviews and decided to purchase based on comments about how waterproof this bag was supposed to be. We drove 2200 miles to Florida and back, through several heavy downpours and each time there was water in the bag. After the first leg of journey, borrowed large trash bags from hotel to store the items. That helped but some items were still damp.Also noticed what appear to be small cracks in the material after only the first use. I think that contributed to the water puddling up in the cargo bag.On the plus side, it does have plenty of room and so the van was less crowded."
5,Very satisfied,We used our roof top cargo bag on a trip and we incountered sever weather and our cargo bag did wonderful. Every thing was dry and the straps did not loosen up. It was wonderful. It was easy to load and the amount that it held was great. Because of the soft material we were able to get different shaped things into the cargo bag and not restricted to a hard case. Great buy. Very happy with product!
3,Picture Does Not Represent Product Received,"Bought as Deal of the Day. Picture does not accurately represent product received. There are RED rectangular reinforcement ""pads"" where straps attach to carrier bag on top. My fix ? Buy Liquid Tape (black) in electrical section at Home Depot and paint over red rectangular reinforcement ""pads"". That brings it to look closer to what is in picture. Bag DOES look waterproof, but if not stuffed well, repeated flapping in wind might fatigue product in corners / creases. Have not used yet, but have confidence will work fine under ""normal"" conditions (not going to try driving through hurricane squalls to find out!)."
1,Waterproof Cargo Bag,This was supposed to be a Waterproof Cargo Bag! It leaked all 2600 miles of our trip. Presents were ruined and clothes were soaked and needed to be bleached. It was a nightmare! I will definitely be returning.
3,Smaller than expected,I can tell you the quality is good but it just seemed bigger based off of the photos...Keeper 07203 Waterproof Roof Top Cargo Bag - 15 Cubic Feet
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"Glorified trash bag with flimsy straps. Sending it back. You get what you pay for. If cost is a concern, use a tarp with ratchet."
1,Leaks horribly!,"This carrier leaked horribly, the first time we encountered any significant rain. It was properly tied down, zipped, with the flaps folded down over the zipper, and the Velcro fastened on the flaps. Luckily, I had most items in large plastic bags, otherwise we would have had a wet comforter & air mattress! I will give this the lowest rating possible, and tell everyone NOT to buy it!"
1,Don't buy it,"I purchased this for my sister and unfortunately she didn't try to use it until 34 days after it had been delivered. It's not as well made as she thought it would be, she wound up using the one that I bought, and I tried to exchange it to no avail. Won't be buying anything from Amazon that I won't be using right away as they really don't stand behind their products."
1,so dissappointed..,I finally had the opportunity to use this and when i did.. it leaked!! we got home and our suitcases were wet! we zipped it up and fastened all the velcro and it still leaked
5,Great Product - Put to the Test,"Arrived quickly, no problems.Worked great. Super value for the money.We drove about 500 miles through sideways blowing snow and rain and everything was completely dry when we got home.Very pleased, would reccommend to everyone.Tim"
5,Perfect!,"My husband and I bought this carrier on Amazon and read all the reviews. This carrier was PERFECT for our trip from Biloxi, MS to Milwaukee WI. This carrier was not noisy and did not shift during our ride. This carrier was VERY ROOMY! We fit 1 double stroller, infant exersaucer, medium tub full of toys, small duffle bag full of shoes, 4 beach towles and 1 twin size blanket in a bag, bag full of halloween decor, small tackle box full of play cars, large bag of diapers, 2 shoe boxes, infant bath seat. There was still room for odds and ends that could fit in the open cracks. We read on most of the reviews to tape the extra straps to prevent wind noise and we did that. This was the best 50 dollars spent on our trip! We HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CARRIER!"
5,This Bag Rocks,"So I spent quite some time researching cargo solutions for use for my annual camping trips.After one year where the vehicle was stuffed beyond its gills, I wanted to get something more sane.This is by far the best purchase I have made.It took ALL of my bulky items and allowed me to use the vehicles existing cargo space for coolers and backpacks and my Screen House.The bag is easy to install, easy to store, is totally waterproof, and holds an absolute ton of gear.I followed another users tip and laid down some of that rubber material that folks use to line their shelves to prevent stuff from slipping and protect the roof of the car.What it held:2 Big Sleeping Bags and sleeping pads1 Pack n Play toddler play yard2 Big tarps1 Large Bag of camping cook gearMy Tent2 Air Beds3 Camping ChairsPackage of Diapers.It took it all and was very secure...stop reading other reviews for other products and plunk down the money for this.its way affordable and just rocks"
1,Too good to be true,"This roof top cargo bag seemed like it was exactly what we were looking for. Unfortunately, upon opening we noticed a 2 inch hole in the stitching right were the zipper was attached. Further inspection revealed that the stitching all around the entire zipper area was not consistently straight. This is a problem because areas where the stitching was too close to the edge would likely rip when the bag was fully packed. We returned this product the day we received it."
3,Is a keeper,"Does everything it clams too. It is a little difficult to fasten to the car and take iteams in/out. We did go through rain at 70+ mph, with no problems"
5,Keeper Cargo Bag,"Excellent roof top cargo bag and it's really waterproof. After loading the bag with luggage and zipping it up, make sure all the flaps are folded down to protect the zipper from heavy rain. The zipper will leak if exposed. If the zipper flaps are folded down, I think the Keeper Cargo Bag could withstand hurricane force rain and the contents kept dry."
5,Just buy it,"I'm 50 years old I spend a lot of time on the road this is by far the best bag I just drove from Miami to Tennessee rain snow wind everything arrived dry and the whole trip I coulnt tell the bag was on top of my car no noise,great buy I love this bag good quality thank you!"
4,Good Value,Appears to be very durable and well made. Used 3 times (about 250 miles with no problems). Fit best on my 09 Honda Pilot with the rails all the way forward and back and the bag oriented sideways (longest dimension perpendicular to vehicle).Holds quite a bit of cargo.
4,works great,"Used it to stuff some random kid stuff on the roof of my Honda Odyssey. It fit well on the rails and didn't budge on the 6-hour drive to North Carolina. Wish it was a little more secure (we stayed in a hotel over night). The zippers are nice and tough, the straps are strong, but they probably won't last forever (the clips are plastic). But for the money, you can't beat it for cheap storage on top of your car. If you travel just a few times a year, it will last you long enough."
4,great product for good price.,"I never do reviews, however this product was exceptional and therefore i wanted to let everyone know how well this bag worked. We traveled close to 2000 miles this Dec from Fl to Pa and back. We encountered snow rain and very high winds due to the blizzard that hit the NE coast. The bag kept all clothes dry and secure. The wind we hit was 40-50 mph gusty wind and well i am sure most people saw the news on the snow storm. I am very pleased with the performance of this product"
5,Cheaper alternative to cargo box,"Great product for the price. Did not leak, despite going through a few thunderstorms. I found that I could fit quite a lot of stuff in it, and it was easy enough for me to put in place by myself."
4,waterproof roof top cargo bag,We purchased this for a trip from Louisiana to Florida. It did not rain so we don't know how waterproof it is but it did the job we needed.
5,Durable and Spacious,We used this on our VW Jetta on a drive/move from WA to UT to CA. No problems. It was a lifesaver for getting all of our stuff where it needed to be!
3,Not good for rain!,"Kind of a pain to first put it on top of the car but then it's ok. Does not keep the rain out, though! Keep that in mind, don't put anything in there that cannot get wet! It is very spacious."
4,Just what we needed,"For the price (on sale), it was impossible to pass up and it served our needs just right - getting a family of four and dogs, with belongings for a ten day stay, to grandma's house and back. I was nervous about increasing our top heaviness, wind sheer and handling with with the car, but none were factors. It held up perfectly to high winds on icy roads on a 1600 mile round trip in winter through MT, WY and CO.Only con is that once it's loaded and strapped, you can't get into it without completely undoing everything, so when we stopped half way late at night and we didn't feel like messing with it, I didn't have any pajamas for the hotel, but solved that coming back by making sure I kept out just what I'd need for an overnight stay."
3,Deluged,"It's hard to say whether this bag would work well under better circumstances. I think it would.We got this bag to transport a futon and miscellaneous items a college son was packing when moving. Without it, we would not have been able to move everything out of his house. It fit a lot, including the twin futon, bedding, linens/towels, coats, a soccer ball, and other items.We drove from Syracuse, New York to New Hampshire in a torrential rainstorm! The items did get wet, but not drenched. It's hard to say whether the rain, blowing sideways, entered the zipper or whether it penetrated the bag. In cleaning it out to fold it, my husband discovered ""daylight"", a tiny hole that was at least partly responsible for the water penetration.For us, it served its purpose less expensively than renting a U-Haul or buying a Thule. Since we didn't put fragile items in it, nothing got ruined, either."
4,It works,"We purchased this product to haul luggage on short trips from MD to VA. It works great. The only drawback is reaching it while it’s on the roof. If you have a smaller car this shouldn’t be a problem, however if you have an SUV, or crossover it very well may be. Maneuvering your luggage to fit is difficult, and then being able to zip it after was difficult. A simple step stool may help :)"
4,"Not Waterproof, but held a lot of stuff!!","Of course, we hit some of the worst rains of the year on a 600 mile trip. It carried a lot of our clothes. We put everything in plastic trash bags as a precaution - good thing - because there was definitely moisture inside of the carrier. But, overall, I'm satisfied."
3,It was okay but not great!!!,"Went on a trip south and had really rainy conditions. Items in bag did get wet, but luckily I did not put anything up there that could not get wet."
3,So NOT waterproof,I don't get how people are saying that this thing is waterproof... as cool as it is it isn't waterproof...all our bags were wet because of the rain. I'll keep using it...during dry weather only is all.
1,RIP OFF!!!,"NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS!! AND THE'RE PRETTY TERRIBLE SOUNDING AT THAT!!! ONLY ON THE BACK OF THE JEWEL BOX IN SMALL PRINT DOES IT INDICATE ""NEW RECORDINGS BY MARK LINDSEY"". STICK WITH THE GREATEST HITS CD ON SONY!! THAT'S THE REAL DEAL!!!"
2,Review,I was very disappointed that this was not Mark Lindsay singing on this CD. Nothing was aid that it was not the original songs.
2,Not the original releases,"These are not te original releases from the 60's and 70's. They are all rerecordings in digital format from 1997. No Mark Lindsay vocals, Fang on bass, or the Kid on lead guitar. Slick sounding, but no atmosphere or bite of the originals. Not my cup of tea, sorry."
4,A pleasant little show,"The animation and artstyle are nicely done on this show. The teenaged girl, Haruka, is living with five robots in a urban wasteland, peopled only by other (usually agressive) robots. Somehow she remains all sweetness and light, despite being the only living human that she knows of. In these eight 15-minute segments Haruka explores her surroundings, goes to a beach and makes friends with a solitary warrior-bot who distrusts humans. There's nothing too special in these two hours but it's pleasant and kid-friendly. The action usually revolves around Haruka needing to be rescued by her robot companions.I'm curious about where this series is leading so I'm giving it four stars for its potential. This show so far, though has very simple dialogue (despite its title) and is light on the action. I will keep my fingers crossed that the second DVD is more interesting. I hope Haruka becomes a more dynamic character. But for now, it's a nice show that won't raise your blood pressure."
4,Lonely girl.,The story is a girl who is the last human on earth after WWIII.Robots help her live and other robots try to kill her.The story has obstacles that the girl needs to go through.Great movie.
3,Serves its purpose,Needed one cause mine was leaking and this worked. Came with new rubber grommets so that was a plus but still leaks so grommets suck.
1,Flawed BarStools,"I purchased the bar and two bar stools over a year ago and they have broken several times. I called the company and they sent a new one - I did not have to return to the old ones. However, they are stored under my steps in the basement. I had a handyman fix the stools but they broke again. We can only sit in these chairs for a short time - and my goodness sakes, no one over 200 lbs. as you could lean back and fall off - as one of my guest had done!"
1,Stay away from this chair and this seller,"This chair looks nice and is fairly comfortable, but you absolutely can't lean back on it. One of the two chairs arrived broken. I filed a claim at that time and got a replacement part within a reasonable period of time. Then the other chair broke about a week later. In frustration I waited a few months to see if anything else was going to break. By the time I got back to the seller they said that they don't stand behind their products, and won't SELL me replacement parts. Conclusion: DON'T BUY THIS CHAIR, AND DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER!"
1,STOP! DO NOT PURCHASE,"Absolute junk! They are not quality at all--fell apart after a week. I cannot warn you enough--these will not last. One wasn't even able to be assembled, one of the leather backs tore at the seam just moving it, after one week the backs came loose and nearly fell off. Totally misrepresented product. You have been warned!"
4,Campy early seventies take on dracula.,Swinging seventies singles take on the old Dracula story and try to modernize it. Excellent example of youth exploitation flick crossed with hammer horror.
3,"A ""contemporary"" Hammer Dracula film","Someone got the bright idea of having Hammer studios do a Dracula film in the contemporary world (say, 1972?) as opposed to in the dim dark past. You get Christopher Lee returning from the grave, yet again, and Peter Cushing doing what is perhaps his best Van Helsing, even though it is a descendant. But the infusion of Sixties culture ultimately dillutes the entire film. Hammer should have known better than to tinker with a winning formula, even with all its limitations. At least they had a certain, definable style. Where are they now?"
4,Was Mike Myers watching this when he thought up Austin?,"Very interesting entry in the Hammer Dracula series...by this time, they were generally running out of ideas, and decided to put the Count in a contemporary setting. But they went way overboard with the ""mod"" 70's hippie scenes...these are right out of ""Austin Powers"", and that character would have fit right in helping Van Helsing fight off Dracula. Aside from that, Cushing and Lee have typical powerful performances which carry the film. And the incredible women, like Munro sure are easy on the eyes. Dracula vs. Powers could have been the title to this, but the film moves at a good pace if you can stomach 37 year old hippies trying to act like teenagers. It is a lot less boring and slow moving than some of the other Hammer Dracula films. All in all, a film well worth watching if you love Hammer or basic cheesiness."
5,Leave It Alone It's a Great Hammer Film,"Its About time for this to come out to DVD Now the whole Hammer/Dracula Series is out on DVD This is not the only Hammer Film coming out this year or DVD this is Bieng released along with ""Love At First Bite"" Another Great Dracula Film and a New Boxset containing 8 Hammer Films including ""Brides of Dracula"" and The Hammer Version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" this movie belongs in your Hammer Collection next to Dracula: Prince of Darkness ""oh by the way I Wish they would Bring that DVD Back into Print"""
2,could have been better,"I purchased this dvd because I am a new fan of the Christopher Lee vampire films. Adapting the character to the groovy year of 1972 was not a bad idea for this film, but it was overdone. Still, it's fun, but if you if you are thinking of buying this film in hopes that it will be as good as Horror of Dracula or Dracula, Prince of Darkness, you may want to pass."
4,Sexy vampire bite,"If you're looking for meaningful quality, I don't know, but this movie contains one of my all time favorite sexy and scary vampire bites when Christopher Lee dispatches Caroline Munro at the climax of a first rate Satanic ritual. Definitely worth the price of admission for just those scenes."
4,Dracula in the Free Love era!,"The beginning of this film begins in the 19th century as we see Van Helsing taking care of some unfinished business!Then(hold on to your hats or should I say ty dyes!)we are off to the age of free love and Woodstock as the revived Count comes face-to-face with the hippies not to mention the son of the good Doc!This film is a lot of fun, but when I watch this one it sure makes me homesick for ""Horror of""(58)!"
2,Horrible!,A desperate last-chance effort to keep this film franchise going. Horrible! I'm sorry I wasted the time to watch it!
3,Not an Anemic Hammer Sequel,This Hammer entry while not the best of the series is an interesting study in Hammer horror. The story although interesting isnt enough to carry the film but Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing make it well worth its watching. The beginning scene and Dracula's resurrection and disposal by Van Helsing are the highlights Campy and strange I liked it very much
3,Gothic Meets Groovitude...,"Drac (Christopher Lee) is back! This time resurrected by a group of hippies in 1972 London! Luckily, the prince of darkness stays in an abandoned cathedral, untouched by the ""way-out"" fashions and hairstyles around him! Meanwhile, Van Helsing's great-grandson (Peter Cushing) sets out to find the count and destroy him once and for all. Several hippies are dispatched, and Scotland Yard is baffled. I still can't get the song, ALLIGATOR MAN out of my skull! Beware!..."
1,The Seventh Hammer Dracula: Dracula A.D. 1972,TO: Hammer Film FansAT LEAST IT ISN'T AS BAD AS SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA!The Good:The begining scene where Dracula is killed with Lawrence Van Helsing is a lost masterpeice! Why didn't they make a film out of that? It would be great! The final demense is also pretty cool!The Bad:THIS IS ONE GROOVY MOVIE! Too Groovy. Way too groovy. Dumb. Stupid. What can I say?FROM: The Hammer Film Reveiwer!
2,"Skip this one, unless you have nothing better to do","Not a great film at all. It is interesting to have the count in the 20th century, but he does not belong in it. He needs to stay back in the 1800's, as Stoker meant him to be.This film is also confusing in many ways. If it is indeed a sequel to ""Horror Of Dracula"", then how did the count come to be? In ""Scars Of Dracula"", he caught fire and fell to his death, leaving nothing of himself (presumably). And, being Professor Van Helsing was not in any of the period sequels, how did they fit this story in about he and Dracula fighting one another to the death in 1872? Did this happen in one of the films when we weren't looking? Very unlikely.At least Peter Cushing returns (finally) as a descendent of Professor Van Helsing. Too bad he could not have been in the four previous films.As I said, this one is not worth watching, unless you're bored. And if you're bored, this film will add to it."
1,"This movie is, like, crap, dude!","Hammer really plumbed the depths with this ""updated"" entry in their Dracula series. Not even the considerable talents of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (which could make a commercial for potato chips thrilling) can save this pic from the trash heap. The acting, previously mentioned thesps excepted, is terrible. The attempts at making the film relevant(you know, hip, man!) only serve to hasten its turning old and rotten. The score has a way of causing the teeth to rattle. The sound of metal pole being struck with a baseball bat would be preferable. All in all, this is a terrible film that makes one long for the earlier days of Hammer. For a much better '70's vampire flick try COUNT YORGA, VAMPIRE or see if you can obtain a copy of the ultra-rare GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE."
2,dark,when this movie starts it is so dark you can't even see anything. The only way you can know what is going on it to read what Amazon tells you.After that it is just stupid.
4,Forget the critics. This Dracula movie does not (...),"This much-maligned Hammer Horror earns poor reviews merely for setting Dracula in modern (1972) London. While Hammer excelled at lush, atmospheric gothic horror, this one works. The plot is much more coherent than ""Dracula and his Vampire Brides"", the modern Dracula which Hammer subsequently released and the first reel music by rock band ""Stoneground"" is cool. Scream queen Caroline Munroe is always a welcome plus although her part is not a large one."
4,Slick Hammer Dracula Updating With Cushing and Lee,"This Hammer updating is a actually very well done and holds up remarkabley well. It's been quite a few years since this one was made and alot of forgettable horror films later, it is plainly in evidence everything that Hammer Films did right! Terrific performances by Lee and Cushing coupled with an exciting yarn make this excellent Hammer. Music should have been a gothic score however."
4,This is a sequal to Horror of Dracula 1958,this has to be a sequal to horror all it is that Dracula must have been brought back right after the events in Scars of Dracula He must have left Transylvania and went to London just like in the Novel by Bram Stoker Professor Van Helsing might have happened to be in london probably lecturing about Vampires The Count Must have Seen him from the events in Horror of Dracula and planned to kill him what we see at the start is the finale of all that they just got the year wrong Hammer made Many Bloopers I can name 10 of them overall this should have been the final installment in Hammers Dracula Series its a pretty good movie come on people Give it a break
5,Love!!!,We love this little car. I had one that lasted through 3 of my 4 boys until we moved cross country and decided we didn't need it anymore and then ended up having another baby and had to buy a new one. All 4 of my boys loved/love this car. My little ones eyes light up every time he sees it. Definitely worth the money.
2,Not like the deluxe version,"I purchased the Step 2 Deluxe ride on car for my grandchildren and they loved it. Knowing that, I purchased this one as an extra. I am disappointed in it for many reasons. It is smaller that the deluxe, it doesn't have a cup holder and the horn sound like a weak squeaky toy. All around, I wish I had purchased another Step 2 Deluxe."
4,fun but?,love this buggy bought one 9 yrs ago. Handle got better but wheels aren't as good. Baby is 9 mths and loves going around the house in it. Can't wait for the weather to get warm. Front compartment is great for wipes and a couple of diapers. Also big enough for a few small toys.
2,Great for a few months,"My daughter loved to ride in her car from 9 months to 15 months but now she is bored with it when I put her in. She puts her feet down on either side while I am pushing which scuffs the tops of her shoes very badly and makes me nervous that I might hurt her her if I go too fast. My other gripes are that to turn it you have to push down on the handle to lift the front tires off the ground - seems like this would wear on the handle. On the first car we got the pin to attach the handle would not fit through the holes, so we had to return it. Lastly - it would be much better if the wheels were rubber. The plastic wheels are very noisy. The whole neighborhood knows when we are coming. Overall, it is cute and it makes younger babies/toddlers feel big but if your child is like mine with the ""I want to do it myself"" attitude, they may get bored with this toy quickly. Check out toys that they can grow into a little better"
3,Not worth,"This toy looks cute but did not work very well. Especially, it has loud noise that Ivan not bear. Moreover, I take my baby for a walk only one time then the wheels have been used badly."
4,My kids love it!,"I have 2 little girls, a 1 year old and a 3 year old they both love it! It makes shopping easier and more fun for them. My 3 yeard old likes to push her little sister around in it and my littlest doesnt get fussy like she would in a cart. The only downfall is it doesnt fold up so its hard to transport in my car, i have to take my truck and put it in the back."
2,The front wheel doesn't turn.. hard to push around!,"I had my eyes fixed on this item, thinking that i will get it for my son and push him to the park. But I went to the store, and pushed this car out of curiousity. Boy it was hard on the arm because the front wheel doesn't turn! So in order to turn the car, you have to lift the front a bit, kind of like the jogging strollers. I already have a jogging stroller, and am not looking to jog him in this push car. It was hard to push even on the nice smooth floor of the store, I can't imagine how hard it would be to push it on the pavements, or off road in the park. If you are looking to push in straight lines, or workout your forearm, go for it!"
4,Best purchase I made for my 1 year old,"I bought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. When we gave it to her all the other kids wanted to ride in it! Everyone loved it. Her second birthday is in 2 days and she still loves her car. The only drawback is that it is lower to the ground than a stroller so it wasn't great for us parents in summer festival crowds, people just didn't seem to see her and we were continually having to announce our way through and when baby gets tired, unlike your stroller there is no where for them to rest their head, so don't go far from home unless you want to carry your little sleepy one. For everyday fare it is a great option and she likes it much more than her stroller."
5,Best (& most convenient) buggy by far!,I agree with all the positive reviews of this buggy. You can purchase it directly from the manufacturer for the same listed price ($39.99) and save on shipping (only $9!!!) www.step2.com
4,Great Toy,"This is a great toy. You can get it much cheaper at Walmart, Target, Sears, or Toys R Us and not have to pay $23 for shipping."
5,Cutest buggy on the block!,I bought this for my 9 mo. old grandson and he just loves it! We all love pushing him around in it. I'm sooo glad it came with a seat belt and there was no having to put it together! All we had to do was put in the handle (what a relief)! And what great service. I ordered it on Wednesday & had it delivered the following Monday! This push buggy is really cute & fun. What a great idea!!
4,make sure tis is not the recalled version,"My daughter had this when she was younger but they have since recalled it because the handle constantly kept coming off. The storage and working horn are adorable. If I had to choose now, I would pay the extra to get the whisper quiet newer model. She did have a blast though."
3,Not a good investment,We got this buggy for my daughter when she was 10 months old and now that she is 23 months old we need to upgrade to something bigger. I wish we had originally purchased the cozy coupe instead because she could have used it for a few more years.
2,Need rubber tires,"This toy is so much fun, my 13 months old loves it, but it is extremely LOUD. The tires are pure plastic and make so much noise on the pavement. I would definetely recommend anyone getting the silent ride version of it."
4,Has practically replaced the stroller,"We no longer take our stroller for our daily walks. My son absolutely loves this toy. He screams and claps his hands while he rides along in this little car. As soon as we say we're going bye-bye, he makes a vroom vroom noise and gets excited because he knows we're going in his little car. The compartment allows you put a few diapers and wipes and maybe a toy or two. The only negative is that it's quite loud, but it doesn't seem to bother him."
1,Red Push Buggy,"This item is fantastic. It's just the right size, not too small or too large. The handle is the perfect size for parents to push their child around. The wheels are plastic so it can get loud when you push it over concrete sidewalk, hard surface. Overall, great product."
5,Useful and fun,"My grandchildren have always loved this and it is easy for adults to push over grassy, somewhat rough terrains.Great purchase."
1,Are you kidding me with the assembly of this thing?,"Well I would love to write a legitimate review regarding my son's use / enjoyment of this toy but we weren't able to get past the assembly. We were terribly disappointed to discover that this requires so much assembly. Seriously, why can't the tires come attached? We broke one of the knobs while trying to put this thing together, which involved a step that necessitated perfect balancing of the buggy on its side, which was very difficult.Grrr, I'm so annoyed!"
1,Nightmare to assemble,"It was literally not possible to assmble this toy properly. The metal rod for the wheel was mishaped and the plastic cover did not fit. Then, the steering wheel did not attach properly. Finally, the screw to attach the handle would not fit flush against the back fo the seat. Do not waste your money or time on this piece of junk."
3,I noticed no other parent mentioned this little tidbit...,"This buggy is awesome...butThe compartment is too tiny. My daughter is normal height/weight(28""/14months/19lbs)Maybe her legs are longer than average but when she places her feet in the compartment, she has to flail them out to the sides to relieve the pressure on her knees.This cart is wonderful. Everytime we shop at Toys R us(past 2 months) I let her ride in it but I cannot see $40+tax purchase on something she is uncomfortable in. I cannot help but wonder if any other mommy had long-legged children who feel cramped in this tiny car??"
2,cute but doesn't turn,"this is a great push buggy if it only turned....you can go straight forward and straight backwards, if you want to turn a corner you have to lift it. We exchanged ours for the Little Tikes version and we (mommy and daddy- the pushers, and baby) all love it."
5,Wonderful,"I purchased this for my son when he was about 6 mos of age (basically as soon as he could sit up strongly. I found that walking him in the stroller was too restricting for him. Once i got the buggy he was able to see more of the surroundings. He absolutely loved this buggy and we used it basically everyday during the summer, spring and fall. I also brought it to the mall and pushed him around in the buggy rather than the stroller. He really enjoyed this and i highly recommend it."
3,Doesn't grow with child,"My 8 month old son loved riding around in the floor model at toys r us. However, I can picture him getting bored pretty quick. It's only for pushing the kid around, not kid-powered like some of the other 'flintstone' cars. I decided to buy one of thoseinstead. The floorboard covers the hole in bottom until he's big enough to push himself around."
3,This is good for kids under 1.5 years old,"We got this for my daughter at 12 months. By the time she was 15 months, it was too small for her. There was no leg room for her and she looked so uncomfortable after awhile. As much as she loved this, we didn't get much use out of it. I think it's misleading when it states ages are for 1.5 - 3. I don't think a 2 year would fit in the buggy."
4,Great for walks no heavy pulling here !,"We purchased a Pathfinder Wagon by Radio Flyer, it was hard to pull up hills, so we bougth this Push Around Buggy, and we and Jack love it.Your child can pretend to stear as you push your child through the neighborhood, he can beep the horn and hide toys and snacks in the buggys hood.Great Toy!!Brad"
5,Push Around Buggy - Loving It....,"I purchased this buggy for my daughter (15 Months) and I have only had it for a couple of days now but I had to pop online - WE LOVE IT- I am not one to write reviews but Madison can really look around and point to squirrels, cars etc and feel the grass, just by leaning over - she is securely strapped in so it is completly safe - she smiles and and yells WHEE!!!!!!!!!!! - and sometimes trys to drag her foot on the pavement - she says Oh OW...how cool is this...she gets bored in the stroller and falls asleep - she looks around and takes everything in while in the buggy - yes, the wheels are loud - neighbors come to their doors as to what the racket is but they smile when they see Baby Madison cruising along, we carry in the storage area, my bottled water, my toddlers sippy cup, Madisons sippy cup, graham crackers, keys to the house and still have room - horn honks....Mom and baby Madi and truly happy - Get one....You will love it."
4,VERY NOISEY!!,MY 9 MONTH OLD SON LOVED TAKING A STROLL AROUND THE BLOCK IN THIS. MY ONLY COMPLAINT SO FAR IS HOW VERY NOISEY IT IS. I WISH THE WHEELS WERE MADE OF RUBBER INSTEAD!!
4,Baby girl loves it -- but it's teeny!,"I was really surprised at how SMALL this car is! I guess I was used to the ones they have at the grocery store, but my daughter is 20 months, and less than 25 lbs and her knees knock right up against the edge of the car. Not a whole lot of room for growth, so I have no idea how they claim this is a toy up to 36 months... I would be shocked if she still fits in it in 4 months. It's a great now present, and thank goodness we have another one on the way because I would have felt a cheated since we wouldn't be able to use it that long. I feel like it's more suitable starting at 12 months and max age of 24 months.Otherwise, she loves it - and wants to ride in it everyday. Just disappointed in the size."
3,Son loves it. Dad not quite as much,My sixteen month old son loves driving his car. It is much easier to push him in this one because of the handle. His other riding toys require bending over.Had a couple of assembly problems - broke the steering wheel but they sent us a new steering wheel without a hassle. Additionally one of the holes wasn't cut properly and I had to widen it. It was one of the more frustrating toy assemblies.The handle is attached by a single screw. It makes my wife nervous when I am pushing him downhill. Also the wheels are very loud. We announce ourselves to the neighborhood when he is driving.Overall my son loves it but I wouldn't necessarily recommend purchasing it.
5,Greatest Purchase We've Made So Far!!,"We got this for our 2 year old daughter for her 1st bday and she still insists on riding it to the park everyday!! Her and our 4 year old son fight over who gets to ride it, so she rides it and he pushes her!! Its an awesome toy for the both of them. I don't know what we're gonna do when they out grow it, but until then, Its the absolute best thing we have in our garage and we use it at least 3 times a day!!"
2,not what I thougth!,"This toy did not match my expectations. I was so keen on taking my 13-month old baby for a fun ride... Her knees already block the steering wheel! Isn't this supposed to go from 9 months to 3 yrs!! Not at all!The wheels are so loud when rolling and not smooth at all! They were so loud I was embarrassed with my neighbors... Also, my daughter kept sliding down the seat - I guess the belt is positioned too low... What I found the most uncomfortable to deal with is that the wheels do not turn! So you have to drag it to do so... I don't want to sound too picky buy all of these should have been considered by the maker... anyway, I took it back and hope to find something more friendly for both baby & me!"
2,Not for tall children,"I got this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. She always wants to go for a ride in it but she has been too big for it since she was about 15 months old. Her feet and legs do not fit in the space provided so they drag on the ground on the side. The designers should think about providing leg space under the front section like in a normal car instead of devoting all the space to the ""trunk"". Granted, my daughter is tall (at 23 months she is 38"", 35 pounds, size 8 foot) but this didn't even fit her when she was 15 months old. I wasn't impressed with the horn on this either - I can make it work, but my daughter can't. The last thing that turns me off about this toy is that it is VERY noisy when riding on the sidewalk or street - everyone can hear you coming a mile away. I didn't have any problems with the handle falling apart like some others did, in fact it seemed very sturdy, just small. I'd suggest looking around for something else."
1,If you child is not small this car is not for you,"I have been researching these types of cars to buy for my son's upcoming birthday. After reading the reveiws on this car and others like it I thought the best thing to do is pack my son up and we would go to toys""r""us and test drive them. I put my son who is 11 months old and 30lbs in this car and it was ridiculously too small. Up to three years of age my foot. If your child is not small for their age this car would not be for you. We put him in the Deluxe Cozy Convertible Car and we could not get him out of it. He threw a fit each time we tried, so we just pushed him around in it while we finished shopping. The cozy coupe is more money, but it is worth it. He loves it! It does not have a seat belt, but it was easy to put one in and very easy to put together. So my advise is before you buy this car take your child and try it out first!"
5,What a great Toy!!!,"This was another Christmas present for our son. I think it was his favorite of all the toys he received. It has made going on walks so much easier. Our son loves to ride in his ""car"" - no more fights over getting into the stroller. It has a storage area in the front that is great for carrying a teddy bear or a sippy cup (there's not much room, though) On rainy days, we also take rides around the house. This is a great toy for parents too - it has a long handle that you can easily reach without having to bend over and strain your back!!! Would definitely recommend this to parents of toddlers."
5,excellent car,"This car is great! It was wonderful for the spring and summer when my younger daughter was 1 year old. My 3 year old could ride her tricycle, and we could push the 1 year old in her ""bike"" (as we referred to it) - it worked! One downfall: it is loud. It's a little hard to carry on a conversation with anyone who isn't right next to you. Other than that, it is a great toy. Highly recommended."
5,fantastic.. it's a must to buy,"I bought this for my 8 month old daughter. She loves it. It's great for walks with the dog. I can handle the buggy with one hand and the dog in the other. We've walked miles with it in the last two months yet the wheels show almost no wear.I use the compartment for holding a diaper for the baby, a dog biscuit for the mutt and a bottle of water for mom. There is room for each.I purchased the buggy so our daughter could feel like part of the action and ride beside our tricycle bound neighbor. Instead of watching, she's now in the thick of it...and enjoying herself thoroughly.It doesn't take the place of a stroller but, for short trips, it's a close call ."
3,I wish it was just a little bit better....,"Let me start by saying YES, I LOVE IT ! And so did my 1 year old daughter. For several months, it was her favorite way to cruise the neighborhood. And other toddlers love it too-everywhere we went, they wanted to hop on. But, ever since she was 14M, she hasn't ridden it. Now, she prefers the pedal power of her Little Tikes Cozy Coupe. I just wished I could get more miles out of it if it somehow allowed her to pedal. So, right now, it's in the basement, awaiting my second child. I think in hindsight, I might have gotten something similar but which can be converted to pedal power like the one they sell at OnestepAhead."
5,great toy!we love it!,"I bought this toy for my 10 months old son.the minute I put him in it he loves it!So easy to push,it has a seat belt so it makes the baby feeling secure and mommy too!love it!just the only thing that it is pretty loud because the wheel are plastic but it doesnt metter that much.overall we will recommend it to everybody."
4,She loves it.,"I got this as a means to get my daughter out of the stroller into something different. We took her out around the neighborhood trick or treating this year. So much fun.I wish it had some sort of way of locking the wheels so they did not role, but no big deal. Fun toy!!"
5,Better Than the Chicco Car - My 9 Month-Old LOVES It!,"We were visiting someone in the children's hospital which is where we first saw this toy - my daughter really seemed to enjoy being pushed around in it so we decided to buy her one for Christmas. Hands down it's her most favorite thing to do now! It's too cold to take it outside now, so my husband and I push her around the house and she smiles and laughs! She could probably do this all day long!We had initially bought her a different car, the Chicco 4 in 1 Ride On car, which we thought might be better because it changed from a rocker to a self-push car for when she's older. But, in fact she didn't like it very much. I think part of it was that the seat was so wide that it forced her legs to spread out and it wasn't comfortable. She never wanted to be on it, so we returned it to the store. This Step 2 car is very comfortable for her."
3,Great in or outdoor toy!,"A fun toy for a ride inside or around the block!Perfect for that 5 o'clock ""witching"" hour before dinner :)"
4,Baby goes BUGGY!,"I bought this for my nephew's first birthday. He loves it! The ""trunk"" is a favorite for loading and unloading...a must do for the 1 year old set. Mommy can push him around while keeping up with the older kids."
4,Fun for my baby!!,My baby loves to go for rides in this. It is great for strolls around the neighborhood or for times when you dont feel like pushing a heavy stroller. It is very durable as I can push it in the yard in front of and behind our house with little effort and I actually started using it when she was able to sit which was about 6 months. This is a great product!
3,Good car but disappointed in size,"My 15 month old daughter loves this car, we gave it to her for Christmas. Unfortunately, she's only going to be able to ride in it for a few more months if we're lucky- she's on track to outgrow it, fast! She is tall for 15 months and on the thin side- moms at the playground say she looks at least 24 months. Her feet rest on the floor while she sits in the car and when she grows another inch, she's going to start being uncomfortable. I was hoping to use this for longer than a few months- so frustrated because the product says it's good for kids 18-36 months."
5,"Best invention ever, great to get some shopping done at the mall","Got this for my little one at Xmas when he turned 14 mons old. He can't go anywhere without it. This has replaced his stroller. We have it in the car and it goes everywhere with us. It's big and bulky on the car, but he loves it too much so we carry it around. It's great for us at the mall, we take it and he stays in it If I need to shop and never complains, and it's funny to see the other kids look at him from their strollers wishing they were driving their own car.We take it to the zoo, took it to disney, also we have it on the yard when it's not on our car and it hasn't faded a bit. We love our buggy, and as another parent told me at the park one day, this is the best invention ever!"
5,MY 1 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS,"My one year old son ABSOLUTELY loves this toy! From the second he got on it, he was in love with it. This is definately his favorite toy! He must have played on it for an hour and a half, without wanting to get off! I definately reccomend this for any parents who have active children. My son is very active & loves going outside. This is ideal for going for a walk to the park, or going on a mall outing. 5 STARS!"
4,Great Little Car,"I did a lot of research on toddler push cars and decided to let the amazon reviews guide me on this purchase. I'm glad I did. The reviews are quite accurate. My 12 month old loves this car and so do the other neighborhood kids. All the little ones want their turn. I love the seat belt - keeps him safe. The handle is great too. I'm tall (5' 8"") and I worried that I would have to bend down to use the handle. Not at all - it is the perfect height - even for moms tall as me. So why 4 stars...I agree with others this little ride is quite loud on the sidewalk and driveway. In and of itself not so bad - but we often find ourselves in a caravan or wagon train with lots of other moms and kids and I can't hear anybody when I'm pushing this car. I have to strain to hear, ask people to repeat themselves and finally I just stop so that I can hear. Not a reason not to buy the car...just know this going in and you can make the best of an overall awesome little ride."
3,Go for the upgrade!,"I have had this product for nearly 3 years and it is great. However, it is very loud when pushed on pavement which makes it annoying to take on long walks. I feel like I am waking up the neighborhood.They now make nearly the exact same product with ""extra large silent ride tires."" I highly recommend paying a little extra for the silence. Your neighbors will thank you. Look for the Step 2 Whisper Ride Buggy.Step2 Whisper Ride Buggy"
3,Interesting but not great,"This is an interesting DVD for any Cartier-Bresson fan, but given the material, I would have made the film differently. You do get to see a lot of his photos and there is some good conversation with the man but the music is annoying and it would have been nice to have a choice of either reading subtitles (Cartier-Bresson speaks French) or hearing a translator. Instead, hearing the translator is the only choice.There is surpringly little meat to this documentary given the fact that they interviewed several other people in addition to Henri Cartier-Bresson himself. I came away not knowing that much more about the man than I did before I watched this DVD."
5,Study the master's,As a photographer I am amazed by Bresson's work and life. I feel it is important to study the masters and put your vision to work. Love this dvd!
1,Giant Rip-off,"Unless you've landed on this page by accident, you must be a Gentle Giant fan. If you are, stay away from this one. Even the most maniacal collector should beware. It's worse than the worst vinyl bootleg you've ever heard. Thin, compressed, recorded-from-the-lobby recordings complete with ambient noise, volume fluctuations, and electronic garble. Now, I've been a giant Giant fan from the very beginning and might even admit that this may be a less-than-inspired performance, too. Bad photos and graphics combined with no information make for cheezy packaging as well. Unless you want to own ""as bad as it gets"", forget about ""Live in Rome"" and pick up ""Playing the Fool"" for a much more alive live experience."
1,Completists Only!,"Although this recording may hold some sort of historical significance that would compel one to acquire it, Buyer Beware - the quality of this CD is equal to that of a poor bootleg! Evidently mastering was non-existent! The overall level is VERY weak, and with little dynamic range. Even thought there is little distortion, the mix is very unbalanced. Vocals and synth leads dominate; the remainder with have you constantly reaching for the volume knob. The packaging is similarly stark and without liner notes.There are quite a few other Live Gentle Giant recordings and your money is better spent on them."
1,Gentle Giant a band with excellence - this isn't choice!,"I've collected 15 Gentle Giant albums. This new addition to the library is better served as a coaster - in that - the recording sounds like as excuse to offer something that isn't. As a collector of fine Progressive Rock sounds, my appreciation for well recorded live concerts includes: Gentle Giant ""Playing the Fool"" and ""King Biscuit Flower Hour""."
1,As everyone has already said...,"This cd is not worth the plastic its printed on. I wish I had read these reviews before I bought it.Don't get me wrong, the performance is solid and the music is good. The quality is just sooooo poor. I'm usually fairly forgiving when it comes to live recordings, but when I first listened to this, there was so much noise that I thought I had a defective disc. Its that bad.I do wish they'd release more live shows from different tours. I guess, if nothing else, this is a step in the right direction."
2,a big disappointment,"although deaver is among one of my favorite authors,I just couldn't 'get into' this book.I struggled almost halfway through before finally giving up"
2,One of his first I believe.,"What can I say? I should buy books by the pound, I always look to see how many pages a book had before I choose to buy it. I could not finish this one,I just could not get into it. His later books I've devoured."
3,Could have been better,"While the plot was intriguing and had some nice twists, Mr. Deaver was just a bit too fond of his surprise segues from one section to another. It was as if he was testing how clever he could be in duping the reader and leading them down the wrong path before they realized they had switched to a new character. Doing this every now and then is fine, but it happened nearly every other page! Yes, we see how clever you are. Get over it. His later stuff is definitely better."
3,The Rhyme series is more captivating,"The Lesson of Her Death, although interesting enough to read in a speedy manner, was definitely not one of Deaver's best. I found a lot of stereotypical characters and scenarios and it didn't grab my attention as much as his other novels. I think Deaver hit something really good with the Lincoln Rhyme series, because Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer were outstanding, but this tale of a disfunctional police officer/family and the 'cult'/'moon' killer was much more weakly portrayed. I think I will stick with my buddy Det. Rhyme."
3,No one of his best!,"I enjoyed the ""Bone Collector"" and ""The Coffin Dancer"". This book was not quite on the same level. The story begins a little slow, but I grew to like the main character, a deputy sheriff in a small town. The pace of the book picks up about midway."
3,Very Entertaining,"This is far from being Jeffery Deaver's best novel but it is a srong tale. Deaver has the ability to make strong likeable characters among the most devilish and harrowing times.The story revolves around the murder of Co-ed. The long list of suspects from ex-boyfriends, college professors and a teenage trouble-maker keep the reader guessing till the end. Even the investigator's family slowly starts to crumble from the events.The story line of the daughter who may be gifted is a gripping side, to which the Father ignores looking for the main killer.Deaver has abilities to show the world of people with handicaps. He also will leave the reader holding their breath till the outcome. The book does tend to get a little long and action does slow down in the middle. Some of the violence is not for everybody. The three stars comes based on the fact that Deaver does have other books that are more well rounded. This is a strong read for any forensic criminal investagation novel fans."
4,A Very Well Told Thriller,"When I first picked up this book, I mistakenly thought it was written by Jeffery Deaver, author of The Coffin Dancer. I was not disappointed, however. The characters in this story are immediately captivating and the action seldom lets up. Some of the surprising twists had me gasping out loud. The only thing that slowed the pace was the lack of punctuation in places that made for awkward and unwieldy sentences. These missteps became easy to ignore once the story got going. I really enjoyed this book, and like other reviewers here, would like to read his earlier works."
2,Fine book...if you live in Great Britan,"Not relevant info for North Americans. Specific model information is buried in text. Not many detailed pictures or description on options, performance data."
4,Here's the real story,"Here's the real story ....Skeleton comes in two pieces... connected at the waist by a metal rodThere are two flat ""plates"" that are supposed to be attached to the bottoms of the feet, but for the life of me, I cant figure out how it attaches. There are no holes and I've felt around and can't feel any either. It stands OK without these plates, so I'll just put them aside and not use them.The eyes do have a battery pack and they flash .. the description doesnt say that, but this is how mine came. The arms are flexible, but stiff - be careful when bending not to break the joint.It looks pretty much like the picture shows."
4,Cool prop,"I had ordered one of these last year from a different company and really liked it. I ordered one this year and it came really quickly; however the face was a little smashed in and there was a tear in the shoulder, so I sent it back. They refunded my money- no problem."
3,False label,The label says TANKS but in fact these are just regular A-SHIRTS made from a light quality material that was just not worth it. A-SHIRTS should say just that!
2,Based on UPN-TV's Enterprise show.,"Chet brings the gang along to appear on Bayport's version of the UPN TV Network's show Star Trek: Enterprise. Not the greatest mystery, but fans of the Star Trek tv show will enjoy this."
5,Great resource,"Great resource for the discriminating modern gun buff. Describes common pitfalls, conditions to look for, and what to be on the lookout for. Sprinkled with dry humor, stories and what-ifs. A must for any student of modern tactical weapons and history."
4,Every Gun Owner shoud have a copy,"Boston really gives you alot to digest in this book. It is an excellent read and gives lots of information on different rifles, pistols etc.. Anyone who strongly believes in their 2nd amendment rights should read this book. Some of it might seem abit overboard, but hey, whose to say....read it and decide for yourself!"
2,Lots of hype on this book but it's disappointing in many ways,"This is something of an updated Mel Tappan ""Survival Guns"" and ""Tappan on Survival"". It's just not as ground-breaking or as enjoyable to read as Tappan's works were. Some of it is informative but a lot of it is wasted rhetoric. I guess if you're interested in how to circumvent the authorities, you might be thrilled with sections of this book but if you look at the size of the book and think you will be getting a lot of information on firearms, you will be disappointed. The book is heavy on rifles, light on handguns and almost devoid of information on shotguns. I'm not into rifles. I'm not real interested in how to buy and sell firearms at gun shows. I'm also not real sure the quasi-legal advise given in this book is trustworthy. For those who are already members of the Boston choir, this sermon will be thrilling. For the rest of us, it's pretty disappointing."
4,Thought Provoker,"The information regarding the pros and cons of different battle systems was extremely helpful, and when contemplating the merits of future firearm purchases find myself consulting it regularly.The reason I didn't feel the book merited a fifth star was the political commentary, and unfortunately, I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending the book to friends because of the section essentially describing how to get away with murder."
4,Probably the best gun book ever written,"About a year ago, I was looking for title by Mel Tappan when the seller recommended this title. I have never seen such a consice and complete that covers just about all the important aspects of firearms ownership for the avarage American. For the price of 500 rnds of CCI Stinger, you could (and should!) possess information that is more valuable than any firearms battery."
2,Ummm this is not really a technical book,"If you are looking for a technical book to improve your marksmanship, this isn't really it. It's much, much more dealing with Gun Politics. Not what was I was looking for."
1,Don't waste your money,"Total JOKE, complete junk.Don't waste your money, book is nothing more than clips of info that available for free on the Internet.Most of the gun law stuff is way out of date to boot."
5,Amazing Encyclopedia,"BGB is an amazing compendium of everything you need to know about guns, scopes and mounts, the anti-gun (i.e. victim disarmament) crowd, self defense, the 2nd amendment, and much more.Boston is as passionate about guns as he is knowledgeable, which makes this a book that is hard to put down. His analysis of .308 battle rifles alone is worth the price of this book. Unlike many who rate guns, Boston doesn't just talk about them, he goes out in the field and shoots thousands of rounds down EACH of the many guns he rates, then gives a comprehensive analysis of their weak points and strong points.He picks apart the 'gun control' lobby, exposing the cowardice and hypocrisy that is at their core.At its essence, this book is about the defense of liberty and freedom."
5,A fabulous resource.,"This book is GREAT. Boston provides you with his distilled knowledge of 20 years of practical experience with firearms. Using his book as a resource has helped me avoid wasting money and time in deliberating which items to buy and which to avoid. If you consider yourself to be a gun ""expert"", you need to read this book. His advice is well-thought out and quantitative. He'll tell you when he is sharing his opinion versus sharing fact, which are usually one and the same. Thorough, comprehensive, and entertaining."
5,A gun nut's delight!,"If you are already a 'gun nut' you will be entertained and enlightened. If you are not a 'gun nut', you may just be converted by the time you finish this book. :-)Boston's Gun Bible is overflowing with information for gun aficionados, covering many topics usually untouched. However this book might be even more valuable for those just beginning to acquire firearms in it's extensive guide to purchasing. (I wish it had been written before my first firearms purchase.)Must reading for anyone with a serious interest in guns or self-protection."
3,Read the facts ignore the rhetoric,"There is a wealth of facts on semi auto military style rifles here. If you are thinking about buying a battle rifle (.308) get this book. The author obviously knows his guns. Also, if you are a paranoid antigovernment right winger, you will find a kindred spirit."
3,Could be better,"A few in-depth reviews of a small number of firearms, rather than the exhaustive coverage I expected from something with this title. The analysis is still good for the ones that are covered, hence the three stars.A lot of politics in it which I did not care about."
3,Good But Not A Great Read,"While a good pro-2nd Amendment read I don't know if I would recommend it. Boston tries to communicate and navigate one from point A to point B but often takes you to Z to make the point. This comes off as being over the top with paranoia.In fairness, while at some points one may think that some of Boston's ideas are extreme take in consideration your immediate environment may be very different than someone else's. For instance, you may not live in an area or have the need to carry a gun around the house with you but others do. And they have the right to do such!Boston is full of opinion but he usually backs up his comments. All the same, opinions are just that, opinions ... and everyone has one."
5,A must read!,Recommended reading for any 2nd Amendment patriot. Explains everything you need to know in our day and age concerning battle readiness and becoming a rifleman.
3,Good but too opinonated,"I read this book when I was still in my gun/shooting infancy, There is a quite a bit of good info in this book. However the authors sometimes over opinionated positions on ""battle rifles"" and ""battle rifle cartridges"" sour the book for me. My advice to those thinking of buying it to take much of the info with a grain of salt, and don't be afraid to cross reference. Also bare in mind that this book was written before the explosion of the ""tactical revolution"" and a lot of equipment and ammo around today did not exist when this book was written."
4,Be Ready,"Very good book for getting ready for anything. Insights on dealing with our justice system, to firearms use, to the US Constitution. A useful reference for using your head and getting ready."
4,For Some this will be A Five Star,"1971 UK Incredible String Band influenced acid folk with much more commercial leanings.There is a whimsical feel with off kilter vocals and instrumentation (flute, hand drums, harmonium, etc) ala the String Band but coupled with big production Moody Blues like harmonies. So for some this will not be pure/raw enough but for others this will fit the acid folk ticket. The songs are tighter than String Band tunes with much more overt hooks.This is very enjoyable. Considering how some bands nowadays strive hard for this effortless sound.Another great UK Sunbeam records reissue."
5,Wow #1 Leg Workout Video!,"This is the first exercise video where I haven't been able to complete all the repitions of moves- my legs were simply not strong enough to keep up with Claudia which gave me a goal to work towards. Because it is such a challenge it definetly will reshape your legs and it seems to me it elongated my legs as well (may be that's Claudia's secret) There is standing and floor work in this workout and with consistency you will be hearing ""Nice Legs!"" from hot guys!"
5,excellent effective and easy,"This video definitely shows results in a very short time and it is easy and fun. I usually never stick with these programs but this one is easy to do and fun. The only comment is the style, in order to make it interesting there are simultaneous frames and shots and that makes it distracting. Recommend it highly."
1,Too Small!,"This container looks pretty enough, but you're going to be caring for a living creature that needs more room and places to hide.having a bowl or tank that's 1 gallon or larger would make your betta so much happier!"
2,does have a few heaters though!,"I went over this album and its not that bad. Yes, there are a few wack songs such as track 3, track 14 and track 16...yes there horrible. BUT theres also about 5 ok songs, like track 15, quitters, and two heaters. Dont know what the other guy payed for this cd but for practically just shipping charge its worth it if you have a west coast collection. Track 5, broke, is tha definete HEATER and i would buy this cd just for that song. Plus track 4 with C-bo and Killa Tay is not far behind as of being the most worthy song on cd. Gave it a two stars for the amount of heaters...."
1,This $hit is wack! Worse Job ever!,"Talking about no nonsense songs and one weak mc.,I wish I can get my money back.Please If you wanna buy my copy let me know.The cd quality itself is an insult to cd technology.THese guys seem to be new in the game!It seems all they wanted to do is sell records.One thing though,that guy Kadosha on the left cover ,he should have his own cd.He is the only one tight! I heard him on some other movie cd soundtrck he was dope.But the other guy ,he is straight out garbage."
2,yawwwn...,"How many people went to the store and said, ""Hooray a new rocket power game!"" Thats right. 2. Very dumb gameplay and takes away what the also boring show is about, sports. The game is about kids who are glued to there equipment like skateboards and run around shooting hockey-pucks at trash can shaped robots. What? This game has awful graphics, is very repetitive and has awful controls and aiming. Not to mention bad cinematic sequences. Also this game is addictive in a bad way. I kept saying to myself, ""I have to get further maybe the fun part is toward the end like the box says."" Nope none of that. Unless you are not one of the two Rocket Power fanatics you can definitely live without this game."
4,LAME!!!,"The concept of this game is rediculus I mean sand missing?PLEASE! sand washes up on the beach every day this seems like an arcade game classic like the little race car game the classic version the last time I boutgh the gameboy color rocket power game it wasen't and did't look real there are seacret level but thier too easy if I could I would give it 0 star 1.dumb concept 2.title dosen't match game type 3.not worth that much! If you are going to buy this game don't, buy the spongebob games way better and cheaper!,PRO GAMEKID!"
4,Review of Rocket Power Beach Bandits! The neatest!,"THQ's Rocket Power Beach Bandits is a very neat game. I love how they used voices to tell the story and that they used the original voices from the show. I also love the 2 player mode on the halfpipe. It is very easy to control, unlike the Tony Hawk games. There is just one problem, you can go into Passwords and they give you about 6 questions and then you unlock the whole game. The questions can be answered by anyone who has seen a few episodes of Rocket Power. This is a well put together game that any Nick fan would love."
5,Nickelodeons best game ever!,"When i saw this game in the shop i thought it wasn't gonna be a stunner, but i bought it, took it home and put it in the console......a few moments after that i WAS IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME, i got hooked from the beginning. Most other games made by nickelodeon are a bit too boring and ..well rubbish but this one is totaly the opposite! Robot smashing was not what i expected but i got it! The best part of the game is breaking into the robot bases and infiltrating the secret rooms, from being hypnotised with twister to the final showdown at the end(i wont tell you what happens as it will ruin the game) this game is sure to satisfy, buy it now this game is one of those unique games that is excellent from start to fininsh."
2,Not true jazz arrangments and certainly not for pros,"Although I cannot recommend this book, it is not totally without its merits. It is one of the few ""true"" fake books that includes the actual introductions to the standards; most fake books on the market contain only the 32-bar body of the song. The handwritten script is also very clean and neat and makes for easy reading. Unfortunately, although the songs included are Jazz Standards, the arrangments are not really jazz arrangments. The arranger has substituted chords in place of the traditionally published chords in an apparent effort to give a jazz flavor. Not only are the chords not really jazz chords (they are harmonically weak and seldom will you encounter a chord with more than a 7th extension) but in many cases are harmonically inferior to the ""original"" chord. The song selection is also rather pedestrian and most of the songs can be found in other books by the same publisher"
5,National Geographic at the top of their game,"This was absolutely incredible. Not much in the way of extras but this program was more than fulfilling at 90 mins runtime. Basically it is the story of a young female leopard growing up with and without her guardian mom. I would say squeamish would not like this. They basically showed many types of prey being captured and the dynamics of the terrain with the interaction of other animals . Thus there were bits and pieces of other animals capturing prey as well. The limber of the leopards was just fascinating to watch. This was not hi def or blu ray , but the footage was just a tad below. Simply an awesome show and well worth the money."
5,Eye of Leopard-- ligthning great!,"This documentary is a brilliant piece of work from the world's best wildlife film makers, Derrick and Beverly Joubert. I first saw clips of this documentary on youtube and instantly i knew i had to have it on my shelve. This dvd is great. Please don't hesitate to buy it. It's worth your money.National Geographic - Eye of the Leopard"
1,Poor Quality,"This is a * remastering of a ****1/2 star movie. The picture quality is very poor--grainy, unclear, and the color is bad. I found the movie almost unwatchable.What fans need is a decent remastering of this classic movie, NOW."
1,"sadly, this just doesn't hold up","I recall seeing this movie as a kid and loving it. However, it looks very old-fashioned, is very stiff, very staged looking. It's just kind of hokey.A new ""Hunchback"" movie is needed. I'm waiting for that one, maybe with Brad Pitt as the hunchback.Best,Film Guy"
2,"More like the ""Stoopedback"" of Notre Dame","While this version of Victor Hugo's novel is more true to the tragic story than most, this version suffers from lackluster performances, slow pacing and some awkward dubbing. Anthony Quinn's performance in the title role suggests a cheap thug rather than the beautiful soul trapped in a hideous body. Gina Lollobrigida is full of sex appeal as the ill-fated gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, but she comes across like too much the tart, and not the innocent of the novel. While the photography is lovely, this film suffers in comparision to the other major versions of this classic tale. I would recommend this film only if you want to compare it with the other versions. Otherwise, see any of those instead."
3,picky,I enjoyed this version of the Hunchback of Notre Dame although Anthony Quinn didn't lookmuch as a hunchback !!The original version with Charles Laughton & Maureen O'Hara is more persuasivewith stronger emotions.
4,The Hunchback of notre dame,"I thought the acting was very good. Anthony Quinn was excellant as the hunch back. As for Esmarelda, Gina Lolo was the movie. She captivates in all her seens."
3,This version runs a distant last place with all the other ve,"While filmed in color, this version does not have the same menace as the Chaney and Laughton versions. Although in some areas' it follows Hugo's story better than the other versions. Quinn gives a good try, but Chaney is the best!"
1,Pretty bad,"This is probably the worst networking book I've ever read. It's also the most pretentious networking book I've ever read. Save yourself a lot of money, go to the IBM website and download a couple of their manuals for free; you may actually learn something about SNA."
2,Learn all about Mark Pataky's personal opinions on SNA...,"A technical reference should clearly present facts and examples, leaving the reader to form his or her own opinions and conlusions. This book may as well be used by IBM as propaganda to help promote SNA. It is filled with useless opinions and promotions from the author. If you need affimation that DLSw is the best solution networking has ever seen, then read this book! Otherwise, don't waste your time."
1,Quite poor,If your looking for an overview it will do but if you need any detail then don't bother with this book. Publications on this subject generally fall into two categories. Simpistic or so complex you don't know where to start.
4,"Neither lead is appealing, but the film works","I couldn't stand Ron Silver's cartoonish Dershowitz, and Jeremy Irons as Von Bulow is over the top in smarminess, but the film works well anyway because the script is smart. The sets are all but perfect, too, capturing Newport's absurd opulence and Cambridge's frayed collegiate look. I have no idea if they got the facts straight or not, but I did find this movie captured my attention from start to finish. Maybe I'll read the book now. Sunny von Bulow comes off as an afterthought here, despite the silly from-the-coma voice-overs."
3,"Aside from Jeremy Irons, Laughably Bad Acting","Am I the only one who thinks that Ron Silver and everyone else in this picture--with the exception of Jeremy Irons--is terrible?Admittedly, the parts are poorly written, but the director let these actors ham it up so badly it ruins the film. The self-righteous liberal (and I am one!) characters--especially the law students (gag!)--are such obvious caricatures I felt embarrassed for them.Terrible!Without Irons, this film is a flop."
2,Not what I expected.,"Didn't really care for this movie. I thought with the actors it would have been better. Someone else might like it, but I didn't. Sorry"
4,"Irons fans, rejoice!","This is a field day for admirers of Jeremy Irons, besides being a great mystery. Irons dominates as the hateful but strangely compelling Claus von Bulow. He really deserved his Oscar. A good movie to rent when you're bored with the new releases against the wall at Blockbuster."
5,Spohr: Clarinet Concertos Nos. 1 & 2,Spohr: Clarinet Concertos Nos. 1 & 2 is a Hyperion records recording under the direction of Robin O'Neill who leads the Swedish Chamber Orchestra and featuring Michael Collins on clarinet. Keith Warsop has written music notes. Also included are photographs and short biographies of the soloist and the conductor. The booklet also includes a painting of Spohr. Highly recommended. 5/5.
1,ALMOST AS MUCH FUN AS A LETHAL INJECTION,"After seeing this on TMC a few years back, my grandfather would dress as the terrorists from this movie. At the dinner table, he'd jump on table top with a super soaker full of you-know-what and squirt it in my guests' faces yelling random puns that weren't really funny.Then, he would run out of the room, change costume to Alan Thicke and then ""save"" me and my guests from the terrorists. Once he held my Cousin Alfie hostage for 6 days without food or water. Did I mention he also turned the whole interior of our home into a high school so his games would be more ""realistic?""Last year, we had to put Granddad to sleep. He was losing control of his bladder. We buried him in 3d glasses. This movie wasn't in 3d, but he wouldve wanted it that way and I deduct a few stars for that alone."
5,Demolition High's First Review,"When I first seen this movie,it was on HBO.I was checking out the T.V. Guide one night and saw Corey Haim's name on the page and flipped to the channel. I only got to see the end of the movie though but what I saw, I liked. Now it's in my wish list and one day I'll buy it. Later,Jason Cory Brown"
2,Disappointing Database,"I purchased this software because not only was it recommended by my school but because a fellow nutrition student recommended it. It has wonderful features for charting and graphing nutrient intakes, but its database is sorely lacking. I would expect that they would have included at least what is readily available in the USDA Nutrient Database, but the software doesn't even come close. For those who eat mostly whole foods, the software is practically useless, especially since it only allows the user to add up to thirty of his or her own entries into the database. All the charts and graphs in the world won't help if they don't accurately reflect what I've eaten! One would be better off using the free, online software at the USDA's website: http://209.48.219.53/."
3,Watch the sizing,"These are beautiful shoes, but run narrow. I typically wear an 8 1/2 in almost any shoes, and I don't even think the 9's would have been wide enough for my feet.It should indicate they run small and narrow for sizes."
5,Learn How to Sell Anything,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn how to sell. If you're a veteran salesman, this is a great review of everything you're supposed to know, and more. Whiting's ideas in this book are the basis for The Dale Carnegie Sales Course (also highly recommended). The discussion ranges from how to get favorable attention of your prospect, through the close of the sale. Includes information on overcoming objections, pre-approach, goal setting, showmanship, and time management. Great book!"
4,"A classic. Great lessons, albeit dated","Percy Whiting is still regarding as ""the man"" around the sales industry. Many argue that Dale Carnegie would not be the success he was if not for the natural sales expertise of Mr. Whiting.The book is dated, and deals with sales methodology that are no longer in use today. However, the premise remains, and the focus is on the salesman, his behavior, and how to ensure that the salesman gets the result. It does not make any room for the ever popular, ""The customer is wrong"" mentality - quite the opposite!In conclusion, the 5 Great Rules of Selling makes for an interesting read, especially to gain an insight to the olden days of person to person selling. The examples of the door to door sales techniques are great, and can be applied to any industry face to face, boardroom selling."
1,This book is worse than bad,"This book is a pure waste of time, money and trees. The writing and editing is terrible. It looks like a technical writer's first draft nightmare and some answers to sample questions are out and out wrong. This is the first review I've ever left and am leaving it as a civic duty. Barron's should be ashamed of this volume. I expect better from Barron's."
2,Perhaps the editor forgot this one.,"This book, although helpful for the exam was EXTREMELY poorly edited. In fact, I doubt if the writer even read it. There were paragraphs interjected here and there that were on completely different topics. It was as if the writer accidentaly copied/pasted some text into the wrong place. Pretty sad if you ask me.I would suggest not buying it. The information presented is weak, and it's hard to get through because of all the errors. Spend the extra couple of bucks and get a better A+ book."
1,The birth of emo,"Chateaubriand's two novellas about the comforts of Christianity and tortured souls in conflict with society inspired the early Romantic writers. It was something new under the sun at the time and many contemporaries felt it was a powerful expression of the discontent felt by many. However, time has not been kind and to these modern eyes ""Rene"" is a nearly unreadable chronicle of moping aristocrats who feel they have plumbed the depths of despair. ""Atala"" is even worse, adding a heaping dose of contempt for the supposed savagery of Native Americans and suggesting that a taste of the white god is all they need to make them worthy of respect by those with elevated sensibilities."
2,Over priced,Way too expensive for a low quality product. The clarity of the picture is poor. There is not enough content to justify the price. I don't recommend it at all. I feel I've been cheated.
1,Or how to sell an easy million copies!,"This book was written to unashamedly cash in on Amway motivational addicts. As a former Amway distributor I know that distributors will buy anything the leaders in the business tell them to. This book will be of no interest to anyone outside the Amway circle. Pure Amway propaganda. For a real look at Amway and multi level, get the book ""False Profits:Seeking Financial and Spiritual Deliverance in Multi-level Marketing and Pyramid Schemes"" by Robert fitzpatrick"
1,Or how to sell an easy million copies!,"This book is unashamedly written to sell many many copies. Having been involved in Amway, I know that the distributors will buy whatever they are told from the people in the business. This book will have no interest to people outside of the Amway circle. Another mind numbing piece of Pro Amway propaganda. Read ""False profits: Seeking Financial and Spiritual Deliverance in Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Schemes"" by Robert Fitzpatrick to get the real scoop on Amway and multi level marketing."
3,they were such a unique group,"i have watched this dvd a lot.these guys were such a unique group of all times and you could see in this that although age and poor health was agaist their will,still their perfomance was so great.to all those people who are complaining about this show i suggest you go to Ebay and find out if they still got TEMPS&TOPS or all the SOULTRAIN VOLUMES FROM 1 TO 20 and there you will catch the FOUR TOPS at their best.otherwise they have tried their best in this dvd and is watchable quality."
2,Not enough of the hits,"Expected them to perform all their the big hits from past, not reditions of others' songs. A medley of some of their big hits was not expected and did not meet my expectations. If you are BIG Four Tops fan, do not buy."
2,Four Tops Top Fan,"I bought this DVD as I am a real Four Tops fan and it was the last recorded DVD before the untimely passing of Laurance Payton-and I wanted to hear Levi Stubbs bring the house down. Unfortunately, even though the old tunes are there, Levi has long ago lost the ability to hit those high peading notes with his rich baritone. In fact, he rarely tried. The other Tops Benson, Fakir and Payton do there best to help but Levi wasn't able to carry the old stuff any longer. Great to see them all but overall a real disappointment."
1,Poor sound quality,I got this DVD and was very dissapointed with the quality of sound on the 5.1 surround sound. My front side speakers and back speakers have no sound to speak of so the centre speaker does all the work. The video is of average quality but a good sound package would have really made the difference.
4,Real Mechanical Engineers Own a Copy,This is the absolute bible of the subject. No mechanical engineer worth his or her salt would be without a copy. It's trenchant coverage of the methods that should be employed in mechanical design is in evidence practically on every page.
4,Dimensioning and Tolerancing,Very good book for understanding dimensioning and tolerancing. Lots of illustrations makes this book one of the best I have seen.
1,Amazon had the wrong book listed.,"The sellers and the product were in fine condition for my purchase. The problem here is that I was looking for the 1982 version of the standard, and what I got from 2 separate sellers was the 1994 version. This was of no use to me in my work dealing with old engineering prints.If you are looking to buy this standard, have the seller verify that they are selling you the 1982 version, becauase Amazon has coordinated the ISBN or barcode for 1994 as the 1982 version."
4,love the name......,heard about this late 60's group when i was in my teens and wanted itfor fans of unusual pop rock this is a mustsadly they broke up much too soon
3,Guys won't admit they make mistakes -so 3 stars,"First off -Don't trust anyone under 30!! I bought the greenleaf of Ultimate Spinach when it was new on the shelf at my local record shop. It was a tossed salad between it and Pink Floyd. The only worse mistake I ever made was marrying my first wife. That of course allowed me to get a divorce and leave Ultimate Spinach with her. I still laugh at the irony of it all. Even taken in context of the error.. oops..era the only way this album could work is if you were higher than the Dali Lama before exhile. Buy a Jefferson Airplane album, listen to White Rabbit, and suck down another Corona and lime."
1,No ballot stuffing here,"There must be people who actually enjoy this kind of music. Well, more power to them. Someone has to, it's the law of averages. But I find nothing strange that most people don't. I cannot take this awful singer, the moronic lyrics and the generic K Tel assembly line musicians. Other than all of that, there's nothing else for this band to offer. I don't know anything about a new Ultimate Spinach, but I agree, what a ridiculous idea. Why steal the name of a justifiably forgotten band? Like calling your group Ultimate Spinach will put bums in the seats?? Right. If the original Ultimate Spinach reunited live and in concert in my backyard tonight I wouldn't bother to raise the windowshade. But I see it this way: the current band could not possibly be any worse."
1,"Laughable, terrible","This is really the worst cd I have ever bought. I could call this junk funny, but it's so annoying and terrible that it's completely not funny that I paid money for this. The singing is mostly awful, and the songs! They are completely ridiculous. If you like bad music, a la William Shatner, you'll love this. Otherwise, stay away."
3,Lousy documentary about a fascinating artist,"After viewing, you'll agree that Leni was beautiful, physically strong, with enormous artistic talent. In this sense, she was clearly unique in the world. However, she was also VERY conveniently ""naive"" to the horrors of fascism, just like nearly everyone else in Germany - and around the world, for that matter. The film itself is the work of hacks. Two hours of fascinating information seemingly put together by junior high students, followed by another full hour of meandering dreck. This documentary is yet another example of how the most inept filmmaker can find success if the story is interesting enough."
5,Lovely Lady,We'll probably never know if she was a nazi collaborator or just an artist who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. All that I know is she was quite a hotty in her silent films.
3,Some people are just credible...,"Molly Ivans was asked why Donald Rumsfeld seems like such a decent, reasonable fella--even when he's discussing collateral damage or heck, just plain lying. She said ""Some people are just plain credible"". And so it is with Leni, to read these reviews. To her credit, Leni does not resort to the ""there's enough blame to go around"" strategy so popular with the current crop of business men and politicians.This is not the place to try her. At her age, she has beaten the game and then some. Her work is beautiful; her talent beyond question but what impresses me most is her arrogance. Its like having a BMW driver on your rear bumper.May I suggest, after you watch this, cap off your evening with one of the new color documentaries on WWII to see what Leni and her pals caused."
5,fascinating and chilling,"I had no knowledge of Leni Riefenstahl, her social/political significance in society or why she was so controversial until this aired on PBS, in 1994. Riefenstahl, best known for directing two infamous documentaries, THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL and OLYMPIAD, that sympathetically depicted the Nazi party. Riefenstahl, born in Berlin, began as an interpretive dancer, a movie star, a mountain climber and then a filmmaker.What was my perception of Len Riefenstahl? I think that she was an incredibly charismatic individual (even at the age of 90, when the film was made). I felt a little sick when they were discussing the Nazis, and her part in (her words) unknowingly glorifying the party's beliefs. I am not sure if I was convinced of that at all. However, this is a very important film that takes a look at the body of work of a very prolific, independent and fiesty woman who stood on her own two feet, up until the very end of her life."
5,"Leni, You are the Uber Noodnik of All Time","I'm floating by you, Leni, with my snorkel bubbling, and my heart pounding. Lets hit the shore and lean back on our hands and shake the sands of time out of our minds, and face the unknown with our own unknown."
5,The Price is Right,Fan of the x-files and don't have this poster? Really?This is an excellent deal on a great poster. A must-have for any fan of the show. :)
3,UK Version of the Poster,"This is NOT the original poster that Mulder had hanging in his office. In fact, this poster was never in any X-Files episode ever. This poster was created in the UK and used a real photo of a famous UFO in an attempt to re-create the ""X-Files"" original. The original looks very different. In the original, the UFO is saucer-shaped and not bell-shaped.There are two versions of the poster that were used in the series. This is not one of them, but its still kind of cool."
4,A must for any X-Files fan,"If you are a fan like me, you must have this, looks great in mi home office!"
5,Nice poster,This really takes me back. Love it. Makes you want to watch the skies. LOL. To all believers - you just have to get this one.
3,Good for the price,The image is a lower quality printing with a sort of grid of a light transparent halftone over the whole image. Paper is forgettable.
2,"I wanted to like it, but alas...","I bought this to show my class and found it both a little boring and sad. Yes, Eggleston is a national treasure but he also is a train wreck.The documentary is not very revealing and what it reveals really isn't that interesting. I got through this once but haven't watched it again.I like looking at his work but really didn't learn anything from this."
1,Junk,"Another one of a boatload of ludicrous bio-docs that are long on surface, short on substance. Almereyda actually has the AUDACITY to LECTURE the viewer (in tiresome ""half-whisper"" fashion that would make Godard cry) while explaining, in a cloying and pretentious slideshow fashion, how to ""see"" Eggleston. Asinine! Almereyda's video succeeds at being everything Eggleston's photography isn't: obvious, ponderous, and masturbatory. Like all of Almereyda's work, this is tediously postmodern."
2,Halfhearted Production,"Poor audio quality and video technique. A production better suited for public access television rather than DVD. Many scenes could have been deleted or shortened. Some essential scenes were placed in the extras. A puzzling, disjointed, program."
1,An insult to my intellegence,A must have for any group home serving patients with MRDD but otherwise this was the all time worst pick and the only lesson I learned from whatching this is that you really need to look at the customer reviews before you rent something. I want my 2 dollars back.I was expecting something that would have been useful or at least marginally interesting. I got to here a few clips about how helping others makes you feel good something I was taught in pre-school.
2,after school special,This movie was awful. It was not at all different from those after school specials from childhood. Not a fan.
2,"If you're 12, the contents of this ""movie"" may be a revalation","This one-hour movie (which won the Estes Park Film Festival probably because the movie takes place IN Estes Park), has several clips from famous people talking about how helping others raises your seratonin. In between the clips are several marginally interesting, overlapping storylines. I selected this movie for download from the ""documentary"" category. It is not remotely a documentary. At most there's 15 minutes of expert, talking-head clips and the rest is the so-called storyline. It's, basically, a ""message"" film. No doubt there are worse things to watch (and put in your head). Even for $1.99 I still feel tricked that it wasn't a documentary."
1,Baby poop!,"I read a review of how bad the acting is in this movie, but it's really the writing that's terrible. I can understand that everyone's taste and range of life experience is different, so I don't argue with any of the enthusiastically ""positive"" reviewers, but how this grade B farce won any awards anywhere is inconceivable to me. For a documentary that features so many people whose work and presence I admire, this is about as tasteless a mess as could be prepared starting out with such fine ingredients. There are kids in high school writing better screenplays than this one. One man's opinion."
1,Ugh!,Might as well have been a Lifetime movie. I bought it thinking it was something very different than what it turned out to be. I couldn't watch anymore than 20 minutes before I had to turn it off.
3,Nyeh,Not worth the price of rental. There's nothing in here that helps the viewer change perspective or practice new ways of thinking.
5,Great!,Soft gorgeous colour!Nail polish as described.Look forward to douing business with you again.Highly recommend.OPI Nail Polish!
5,Beautiful color!,"This is a sparkly pink-coral shade that's perfect for summer. It goes with just about everything, and like all OPI colors, it lasts for several weeks. OPI's applicator brush is my favorite, and I'm glad I could add this color to my growing collection."
1,Boring,I realized half way through the book that I just didn't care what happened to these people. The story line just dragged. I rarely don't finish a book but was glad to put this aside.
3,Meh,"This tea wasn't bad. Just not great. I love China Mist teas, but this one was nothing special. I couldn't taste much difference between this and plain Lipton, to be honest. If you are wanting iced tea with a nice subtle flavor, try China Mist's orange blossom ginger white tea or their blackberry jasmine green tea."
2,Disappointed,"Fabulous idea, terrible execution. Contrary to what you might think, this is not an actual collection in the meaningful sense of the word. The books arrived disordered and poorly packed in a cardboard box, so that some were damaged in transit. It comes with no display box or case. Also, unlike the photo, the books were published under three different generations of Pengiun editions, with different sizes and colors. It's not a collection. It's just a pile of books with a discount."
3,Some glaring omissions,"Sure, this has some fine reading for the young ones to keep them away from that creepy Larry Porter bloke, but it's missing some greats. Where's Carl Barks' Donald Duck or Uncle Scrooge? Little Lulu? Calvin & Hobbes?All words and no pics makes Jack a dull boy."
5,"Handmade ""instant"" wow!","If you have never made your own cards before - this is the place to start. But most especially, if you want to hear friends go ""wow"" when you give them a card. Then this is the right place for you.Paper embroidery is a very simple and easy craft to learn, but the finished effect is sensational.With the simple instructions contained within this book, you will astound even yourself.Choose a pattern. Get some metallic threads for extra sparkle.A needle and a blank card. And in just a small amount of time, you will have made a very impressive card. All for very little time and almost no cost.With this book containing over 150 designs, I doubt you will ever find a pattern book that is better value.Don't wait, you know this is a great deal, so order it today."
2,"Disappointing ""basic"" guide","The title indicates that this book is for rank beginners. As such, it is a disappointment. Although it has some good patterns to copy, the directions for use are as sketchy as are directions in Fortner's subsequent books. Although learning a new skill always entails some degree of trial-and-error, learning to embroider on paper with this book as a guide guarantees frustration with the learning curve and easily could cut short any interest in continuing to persevere."
2,Where do I buy supplies?,"The designs in this book are pretty. So what? I have no idea where to buy the supplies listed in the book--Erica punch mat, Erica punch pen with matching needle in 3 sizes, scissors for decorative border, Erica brand, I think.This is the first How-To book I've seen without a source guide at the end of the book. It's shameful. This is not a book about the basics, its' a book for people who already do the craft, and presumably, already have a full complement of tools.I would have rated this book one star, but the designs are pretty. So, if you've got the tools, have fun. I can't. Ms. Fortgens doesn't care if I'm able to acquire them. She's preaching to experienced crafters that have cracked the code of finding tools. I'm guessing that since the tools' brand name is the same as the author's first name that she's involved in the manufacture of them. I would expect her to try to sell her tools, as well. Guess not. It doesn't make sense to me."
2,disappointed,"I was so disappointed, waited all week for this to come & will return it as soon as possible. I'm a newbee at this craft and there was not a word about where to get the supplies. Oh well, I guess you live & learn."
5,Brilliant value,"Having borrowed this book from a friend as an introduction to embroidery on paper, my wife wanted her own copy. Erica Fortgens makes card making using this technique very easy. The instructions and tips are well thought out and clear. The patterns encompass the complete range from beginner to the more advanced and the designs are superb. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys card making."
3,fun - with attitude!,"OK, so I learned very quickly that either you make sure all those little holes are in the meat before you push the plunger on the gadget, or you wear the marinade! We put a garlic herb marinade in a pork roast, and that was the moistest, most flavorful pork roast we've ever had. Putting the flavor inside the meat works so much better than a rub on the outside. Next, we're going to experiment with the chopped herbs/minced garlic injector and see what we can come up with."
2,No replacement parts,"We love the sturdiness of this injector, but buyer beware! There are small, clear o-rings that are not very noticeable but slip off the needle very easily. (Alert your dish washer- my husband lost ours down the drain.) We called the company directly, and they do not sell/provide replacement parts!"
4,Turkey Injector,"Very sturdy, no plastic to crack or break. Does a good job. The liquid needle may have too many holes for easy filling as you have to keep it submerged about 2 inches. If you don't have that much liquid all you do is suck air. Good idea to have lots of holes to make injection more spaced out in the meat but it is hard to fill without having a deep container of your injection liquid. Too easy to contaminate your marinade. Be sure all holes are in the meat or you will squirt stuff all over when you push the plunger. Still trying to figure out an easy way to fill this thing.. This should last for years. Recommend this for anyone who wants to inject meat with flavor."
2,Not the quality you would expect,"I purchased this injector in August 2009 as I am a meat smoker and wanted to buy an injector that was built well and would last me a long time. After 3 uses with the injector - like another customer mentioned - the fine threads that hold the top plunger into the main injector unit ""stripped."" I never forced the unit on and was always careful with it - but it stripped. While I am passed the warranty period on the unit - I am now trying to get a replacement. Will see. I would not pay the high price for this injector."
4,Good Product,"Works great if you use the larger injector needle included for spices. If you use the other one you better not have any spices in your marinate, they'll cause it to clog."
3,Doesn't work as a insulin injector at ALL!,"I have the diabeetus, so I bought this for injecting my insulin. The gauge is too large and it left a gaping hole in my skin! While it technically did perform the task of getting the insulin into my body, I lost so much blood from the Grand Canyon sized hole that it resulted in my sugar level getting worse than before the injection. They need to put a warning label on the packing letting people know they will need a tourniquet and possibly a pint or two of blood for a transfusion(red KoolAid is not a suitable substitute btw)"
4,like the metal,"I had an earlier injector that was made out of a clear plastic. It cracked in the dishwasher after several uses, so I went searching for something a little more durable. This solve that problem and is almost perfect - I've used it a half dozen times with no real problem, although I'm careful when screwing it together. The threading feels thin enough that if I were to force it, I could damage it."
5,Stone Roast,"This seasoning injector makes it easy to put in my special marinade into the butt roast that I prepare every year for Little Christmas, now it is so easy, I'll probably make my roast several times a year! It also makes it easy to clean!! Great Item."
1,Hazardous Junk,"I must say I was not impressed with this product. When removing it from its packaging, the pointed tip on the end of the liquid needle fell off!. If this would happen while injecting a piece of meat, it would create a potentially hazardous situation as someone could swallow it. The part is pretty small and would be hidden inside the meat. I recommend this product to no one. To all of you who already have one, BEWARE!"
2,GrammaJules,"Very unhappy with this, the rubber ring broke, have only used it a few times, and I can't get the liquid into it. Once I do, after many different tries, it is a big mess. There just wasn't any helpful instructions to this. So for me, a waste of money."
2,I will not order this again,"Mostly my own fault, but this injector does not meet my needs. The output is not near the bottom of the needle...instead, there are multiple holes along the side of the extremely long needle. Even when injecting a 9lb pork butt, the top holes were exposed allowing my injection fluid to expel from those areas and not into the meat. Also, the diameter of both needles are very large leaving huge holes in my products. Perhaps there is a market for this item but it is only injecting very large cuts of meat....it's not a utility style injector."
1,Damaged,The packaging of the product was already open and the rings on the base were damaged. The finish on the rings was not finished.Contacted seller and am returning for a refund.
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The item was adequately packaged and arrived in good condition. It appears to be made from quality base materials. The first thing I noticed was the smell of machine oil. Not a problem as I was going to wash before using anyway. I found that the tips would not fully seat into the barrel. The threads had not been machined all the way through on the barrel fitting. Also when I separated the plunger form the barrel, it was full of metal shavings. I've seen better quality work from a high school machine shop. The threads are metric so it was a little challenging to clean them up. The tips had to be tightened with pliers so no leakage would occur at the attachment point. Once this is done, the unit works well. The thought of needing pliers to attach and remove the tips is reason enough to return item."
3,Rubber parts don't last,"I got this a few years ago, and it worked well at first. But after a few years the rubber o-ring on the plunger started to weaken and leak. Worse the seal for the needle threads started to dissolve leaving black gunk mixed into my butter I was injecting!I was able to redo the needle threads using teflon tape, which was much smoother and made a better seal.I tried the same thing on the plunger o-ring, but it still didn't make a clean seal."
3,Sturdy but flawed,This injector serves its purpose. I like the heavy duty feel of the material and weight of the the assembled unit. My biggest issue is that the multi holed needle is very easy to get clogged up but a nightmare to clean. The tip of the nozzle does not come off like others I have seen so it is very difficult to get something out when it gets stuck. I had to used a can of compressed air to clean it.
4,Works out very well,"Easy to setup, fill and dispense into meats with no leaking. I have only used it twice, but I'm happy with the purchase, so far, and will update my review if anything changes."
3,Ok,I wanted to use this with marinade with seasoning. The needle for the injector got clogged the very first time. I had to get the Cajun butter.
3,"Good quality, but hard to use with one hand.","I picked up one of these to use at thanksgiving this year. I was frying 5 turkey. The injector is heavy (in a good well) it feels very solid, and the quality is quite good. The problem is that it's a bit difficult to operate with one hand. Injecting is fine but filling the injector with one hand is pretty difficult. If you have small hands you may want to consider another product, but if filling it one handed is not something you think you'll need this is great for the price."
5,Where have you been all my life!,I got tired of the small injectors breaking or getting clogged with seasonings. This is great. I received it in a timely fashion.
1,Metal except for the silicon ring,The injector was great until the silicon ring broke making the injector useless. I called to get a replacement ring but the company said that they did not carry them and that they could not help me get one.I could not find a replacement elsewhere. So the extra money you pay for the metal injector is not worth it. A cheap plastic one would cost much less and last longer. Poor customer service.
1,"poor quality seals - suffers from ""weakest link"" syndrome","The plastic seals turn a potentially good product into junk. Plastic is too hard to easily tighten needle by hand, so the liquid runs out of syringe or shoots out of seal when injecting the meat. Will try to replace with some softer rubber o-rings from the hardware store, something the manufacture should have done in the first place."
3,"ok, not great","Seems to do pretty well at injecting, but the screw top attachment at the top of the syringe has already lost its threading after 1 usage. I'd keep looking for a better one, especially since this one was rather pricey."
2,"Great meat injector, maybe.","As an earlier reviewer noted, the threads attaching the plunger top to the cylinder are very easy to strip. The customer service was great, got a replacement in less than a week. I just hope it was a defect in the first one and not a design issue, this thing is made in China, so I don't know yet. I will be very careful how I screw the top back on after cleaning, and I also suggest putting vegetable oil on the threads.It looks great and indestructable, but.....we'll see."
4,Works as advertised,"Large caliber needles are not flimsy. Not simple to clean. Effective seal. Can cross-thread, so be a little careful. Sturdy."
4,Worked as advertised,"I see the point other reviewers make about the gasket, however, if you're careful with i and don't let it dry out it shouldn't be a problem. Well made and worked well on our turkey. Will use again."
3,Should be larger,This injector is well built and will last for a long time. I wish it held more! I spend more time filling it up than injecting. It works well and does what it is supposed too.
5,Great injector,I've only owned this tool for a few weeks so can't say how it will hold up over time.The build quality and finish are first rate and the O rings should last a long time if maintained.The quality is good and the price is rite. What more can you ask for?
5,Bayou Classic Injector,"Very nice product, stainless steel cleans up easily without staining like plastic would and there's no question about applying pressure to shoot the seasoning in there with the stainless handle. Very pleased with the product and it's quality."
4,Relevant and informative,"Compelling and provocative, incredible depiction of the struggles of so called ""immigrants"". Provides a great context and should challenge anyone's worldview."
5,A masterpiece,"I bought 5 dvd's about the border issues, this is the best one. The music is cleverly chosen and greatly heightens the viewing experience. Highly recommended and educative."
1,"Not much of a ""LIVE"" album","I am a big fan of Pam Tillis. I have been since her debut country CD ""Put Yourself In My Place."" I think Pam's albums are great. It is a shame she is not as popular as she was in the mid nineties. This album however is the WORST live album I have EVER heard. The audience doesn't seem too entertained. Usually when an artists begins and finishes a song on a live album, you hear thunderous applause. Not the case on this one. Did she only sing to 5 people? Pam's vocals and the band seem off as well. Normally really energetic songs like Mi Vida Loca sound dull, drug out and boring. Don't be fooled by the amount of songs either. 3 of the songs are a medley and only portions of them are played. If Pam is wanting to get back in the spotlight and give her fans something worthwile, she needs to do MUCH better than this!"
4,Check this out!,"James Carter has been known as a virtuoso on almost any woodwind instrument and on this cd he plays alto through bari sax. This cd is upbeat and really never gets that boring. Some of his other cds to check out include chasing the gypsy which is a little more laid back but again never gets boring. There is a saying on the inside cover of this cd that says ""hands and eyes on the prize"" in which his spiritual but straightforward nature really shows through. Some would classify this style as avant garde but it is not some far out style, it really has a great flow and musical quality to it. Sophisticated Lady is the last track and he sports the bari sax and plays it the way duke ellington meant it to be played."
2,An afternoon of silliness,"I read this for the sake of reading something in English. It wasn't a terrible book, so to say, and the plot is somewhat original. But still, I had the feeling I was reading for Adolescent Literature again."
1,read carefully the academic reviews of this daitribe: THIS IS AS HISTORICAL AS FOX NEWS WHICH IS NOT FACTUALBUT,"this is political polemicism, not historyto bring it up to the present we only have to look at how Hallibruton has bankrupted our nation for generations to come. CApitalism did not save our nation but destroyed it, as great Americans from Jefferson to Eisenhower predicted.Please check out the POV of this author. Read the editorial reviews here for a full explanation of where heis coming from and what he wants to sell you. THis is not an academic scholarly text but self-serving profitable political propaganda of the kind which has ruined our nation this millenium"
5,Well written,This book tells you of the importance of Captialism during the growth and development of our country
1,This is Part 1 (of 2) Only,"This review pertains to the paperback, large print edition. This fine volume is part 1 of 2, only. It covers Matthew chapters 1 through 13, and it's only about 330 pages long. The book quality, typeface, index are all excellent reproductions of this classic work. I would otherwise rate the product with 5 stars, but it's not what's advertised.You'll need to find & buy part 2 of 2, to complete the set. I ordered a Part 2 companion using ISBN-13 number, 978-1171943969. Shop around."
2,not worth the money,These are the smallest trucks(about 2 and 1/2 inches long) for the money I've ever seen and I'm the mother of three grown sons and 2 grandsons. You are paying for the Sesame Street name. I'd suggest spending your money on generic trucks and get more for the money. That being said my 1 yr old grandson will probably love them and I'll end up eating my words!!
3,OK for what you pay for it,"I purchased this item as a second pad so a friend and I could workout together. The mat that I got for Christmas was much better and does not slip. This pad came in a clear plastic bag with no box and the instructions that came with it were hilarious. It was written the exact way a person who is learning to speak English as a second language might say it. Overall, if you just want a cheap pad that you will probably have to replace (if you are a hardcore DDR player) sometime within 6 months, this is for you."
2,Not really totally worth it but cheap,"So i don't recommend getting two of these cause i did and you can't use them both at the same time. They are a bit finiky You have to plug them in after the game has loaded and there MUST be a contoller in the first slot or the dance pad goes psycho and you cant do squat, but if one person wants to dance while annother uses the controller they work perfectly fine, as long as you ajust the mat every song."
2,Disappointed,"Well, I thought I was getting the same type of pad that came with the game itself, but I was so wrong. I bunches up under my feet while playing, and one good step has sent it flying right across the carpet more than once. If you can manage to keep it still (placing a towel beneath it helps), then it's pretty good at accurately reading your steps... but that's only if it doesn't cause you to wobble and fall. A decent Beginner pad, but if you're playing on Standard (Difficult) or above, this is not for you! Just spend the 20$ or so on the real one!!"
3,DDR on a PC is difficult to do,"I bought two DDR pads so I could play a game called Stepmania on my computer with the real pads. While this game is compatible with the real pads, the USB adapters for Playstation 2 controllers often present a problem. Most see the arrows as an analog stick, which means that opposing directions cannot be pressed simultaneously. You must purchase an adapter that sees each arrow as a button rather than a direction so that opposing directions may be pressed simultaneously.Also don't get them from my seller. ""The Game Shop"" made me pay for shipping and then my purchase arrived 10 days late but they pulled some crazy trick and changed the expected arrival date so it wouldn't look like it came in late. The pads are fine though."
5,Better than OEM,This mat is better than the one that comes with the dance revolution game.This one is not shiny plasticky but a matt finish and the kids like it better. You definitly need two mats.
3,It's ok but not as good,I purchased this dance pad because it looked like the one that came with the original box but it's not exactly the same. When my kids use it -it moves around more than the original and since eyes are glued to the tube many times my kids don't event notice that it's crumbled up because it does not stay put. It's ok but if you want quality - pay for an original pad.
4,COMMENT ON MY PURCHASE,"MY DAUGHTER IS SO HAPPY THAT SHE HAS THE DANCE PAD ONCE AGAIN. BECAUSE THE ONE SHE HAD STOPPED WORKING BUT THANKS TO AMAZON, SHE IS ENJOYING HER DANCE PAD ONCE AGAIN. THE DELIVERY TIME IS EXCELLENT."
3,Meh...,"It was okay at first because I played on light for about a month or two and I was doing okay, I got the A's and B's on three or four footers. But then I got really addicted to the game I would play for an average of three hours a day and nightmares about arrows. AGH! GOT TO STOMP ON THE ARROWS! So I cranked up the difficulty to six and seven, and I had some problems. Some times when I had to hit three arrows in a second It said I missed one but I know I did press of the arrow. Sometimes the arrows rapid fires on its own. Its annoying because all those C's and B's I know that they are supposed to be A's.Over all, get it. Only if you are new to the game."
2,Beware,"Even thought the picture shows the Konami logo on the bottom, this pad definitely was made from a third party distributor. Some buttons aren't as sensitive and the sensors seem to be located in the wrong areas. Don't purchase this, you'll regret it."
2,Not responsive,"This mat does not respond to my steps half of the time, which isthe problem I had with my first mat and is why I wanted to replace it with this one. Total waste of money."
2,Works when it wants to.,"I have bought two of these dance pads, they only work when they want to. They are good for small parties but thats it. Hard to play even the most simplest of songs. 2 stars for working (kinda)"
4,A good pad.,"I've enjoyed Dance Dance Revolution for a few years now. It's a great way to exercise and dance to some really cool music. This dance pad is great; the only complaint I have is that the up arrow is very sensitive, so I can be standing in the middle of the pad but the up arrow presses randomly. It's still fun to play, though."
3,Slowly but surely....,"I was overall happy to get my dance mats. It too a little longer than it should have but they work at least. There seems to be a little glitch in them, I don't know it it was from the way they were transported or not."
4,Great control,"Loved it, works great on ddr games, I never knew that it was so much fun till I got the hang of it. Huge pad which needed an open area for movement. I would recommend this to every one."
3,DDr mat,"This product works as well as the original DDR mat though the covering is thinner than the original and it tends to bunch up after very little use. After three weeks, the fumes from the plastic still smell toxic, even after airing it outside."
2,Cheep is what you get,I recently bought DDR and needed an extra pad so scanning through my options I found this one for around 5 dollars so I thought I would give it a try. And I got what I paid for. Half of the time the buttons don't work when you press them so if you are trying to use this mat for points or challenges it isn't worth the time. The mat slides all over the place while you are using it so you have to stop and adjust it after each song. But for 5 dollars I shouldn't have expected a great mat. I don't think I would recommend any one buying this mat since shipping costs more than it does and you are frustrated by the time you finish playing. I would say just spend a little extra money and get a nicer mat.
3,Cheap dance mats don't last long,"I received this dance mat at the beginning of July and after using it once a week since then for 45 minutes, one of the buttons is sticking or not registering pressure. It's cheap for a reason; spend the extra cash and get a better dance mat that will last more then 4 months."
4,good buy,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and she and her friends used the heck out of it--it was agood buy and i would buy another one if needed!
3,Good but very sensitive,"The mat works great but some of the buttons are a little too sensitive. For example, when your not playing you stand in the middle circle which is supposed to not be a button the makes anything happen. However, sometimes when I'm starting a new game and I use my left foot to click the X button, any one of the arrows will think I'm stepping on that also and I can't make a selection since it's moving on the screen.I literally have to step off the mat completely and step on the X button.When I'm actually playing a game all the buttons works fine though."
3,extra mat,The game is a lot more fun with two players but this mats sensors stuck on the first use. was tempted to return it but the kids played with it and got it working properly.
3,"A softer side to SBB, but WHAT HAPPENED to the hard side","First, I'm not going to say I hate this album because they went soft but because they deceived their fan base. Very well produced, but in the same sense, they sound just like every other pop-punk album out there today. Their earlier releases made them a distinctive band and it was excellent emo-core. Now just like a lot of bands I USED TO LIKE, having gone soft has thrown this band into the same genre of all the pop-punk crap.Still a OK album, but be different and creative. If you are younger and into New found Glory, Saves the Day, Sum 41, Ect... you get my point, you will love this album.I suggest you look at their earlier releases if you like emo-core, or Rites of Spring, Hot Water Music, Embrace, Jawbreaker, Ect..."
1,An hour and a 1/2 that I will never get back!!!!,"Well, I have officially just wasted an hour and a 1/2 of my life on a movie that is quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Do not waste your hard earned money on this sorry excuse for entertainment. It was horrible!!! Even with the hottie from Unfaithful, it wasn't worth it. Do yourself a favor, and pass this one up!"
2,INSOMNIACS DELIGHT,"ANGEL OF DEATH would be a good movie for insomniacs. It's incredibly slow and the plot is so convoluted and confusing, it's hard to keep up with it, if you even stay with it to the end. Mira Sorvino and Olivier Martinez sleepwalk through their roles, and it is only the glorious presence of Italian screen legend Alida Valli that induces me to give it two stars. She is marvelous as the elderly lady whose story is at the heart of the picture. She commands the screen with gentle elegance and she deserved a better movie than this."
3,The Angel of Death,"This movie was kind of gory and a little too graphic for me. I absolutely love Olivier Martinez and that is why I ordered this movie, however, I prefer him in romantic roles."
2,Boring,"I like what another revioewer said to described the ""sleepwalking"" acting in this movie. I got the movie in the bargain bins at a Blockbuster basically because Mira Sorvino is in it and I like many other things she has done, even the ditsy Romy and Michelle. But this movie really goes nowhere, slowly."
5,"Owner/Atomic Computer Solutions, LLC",This is the 5th Linksys 10/100 Ethernet hub I've purchased for a client and its worked wonderful.J. Hall
2,Little of Substance,"I was very disappointed by this book. Ninety-five percent of it was anecdotes and generalities, none of which had much value. The writing is mostly in the nature of celebrating the fact that this wonderful thing, the ringing sound, exists, and how great it is to have found it. All of which I agree with, but I wanted more about how to meditate on it, and I found very little here. The best thing about the book is the bibliography, where you might find authors who have more of substance to offer.There isn't a lot written about the ringing sound (anahata nadam in Sanskrit, or Naam). I, for one, will have to keep looking.Since posting the words above, I've come upon The Law of Attention: Nada Yoga and the Way of Inner Vigilance, by Edward Salim Michael. It is exceptional, with four or five substantial chapters devoted to the inner sound. If you want to learn about the inner sound, this is it."
2,"Great Topic, Good ""Start""","The book has a great title and a good but brief introduction to the topic, but falls short of the promise by padding a few good pages of information into book-length with ""la-la"" filler. I was bothered that the entire ""what you hear"" section was vague and hardly filled one page. For example, there was no mention that many folks hear chords, and no mention of the pitch, that very curiously for many is the older musical key of A (~425 Hz), might possibly be the source of our musical scale, and no mention that the sounds become stronger when one clinches one's teeth. Nonetheless, this book is the first entry into a field rarely separately discussed, and my hope is that we don't have to wait long for the ""fully researched and revised edition""."
3,"Pretty, but...","The necklace is very pretty, but oddly, the necklace curls upwards, so is a little annoying."
5,A Cat-Fest Of Laughs!,"Anyone who likes funny things and cats will love this book. It is full of little stories and one liners and cartoons about cats and what they do, all amusing. Everything is done in black and white. My daughter, 10 years old, also found this book full of laughs. The only problem I had with this volume is that the binding along the spine became separated, but I recommend it anyway."
5,Awesome! conveys facts in a hilarious manner....,"Mr Baker should be given an honerary Ph.D. in Veternary Science, specialization in cat psychology."
2,Has this guy ever HAD a cat?!,"A friend gave me this book, so at least I didn't lose any money, but I'm glad I didn't pay anything for it. It is mildly humorous, but it mostly left me wondering whether the author has ever even lived with a cat. Probably about 1/3 of the material is right on target, but most does not apply to any cat I've ever had and certainly not most cats. My mother read the whole thing, and her first comment was that she thought the author had never been in the same room with a cat. Way too much of it is based on bad stereotypes (e.g. that cats scratch people a lot) or complete misinformation.I wasn't expecting anything beyond light humor, but I did expect for it to actually apply to how cats really are! Parts of the book are funny, but most of it is either repetitive or just inaccurate. Don't bother buying this for the cat lovers in your life!"
5,A wonderful guide.,"Don't you know that you don't have a cat? It's the cat who has you. Now, you have to keep your cat happy. Cat's are always picky, though. So, Stephen Baker has come up with a guide: How to Live With a Neurotic Cat. Cat owners and cat lovers alike, will love this book. My copy is bent and worn from everyone reading it. I could read it over and over again"
4,No Heroes No Villains. Good Book,I'm in 12th grade and we had to read this book for our Law and Government class. This book was really good. It helped me really understand what our court system is like. Like when Steven Philips discribes everything that he did in his case how the jusry was selected. What the Public Defender was basing the whole case on. What he thinks happend in the shooting of Skeagen. If you want to know more about our court systems. This is the book to read. Very interesting
5,Great Deal Top Quality,This was a great deal for top quality floss! Fast service. You can never have enough colors and these are ones anyone can use!
4,very good - but not for outkast,"I'm a huge fan of Outkast, and Aquemini may be my favorite cd of all time, followed by ATLiend, Speakerboxxx/The Love Below a.s.o !I still feel their innovative, original and superior touch in every track, but it's like the last half of the album is stuck at the blues sound and movie samples.Big Boi has only one production, ""The Train"", which is one of my favorite tracks. I've always seen Big Boi as the best rapper in the group, and André 3000 as the best musucian, and André delivers the best tracks, musicwise, with ""Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry 'Bout Me)"", ""Morris Brown"", ""Chronomentrophobia"" and ""Life Is Like A Musical"".In a interview with Vibe Magazin, André says, and i quote; ""I', sorta hating making music right now"". This does not show at all.Any Other artist could only dream about making an album like Idlewild, but as a Outkast fan, I'm not shocked. Vibe Magazin askes; Outkast, are they hip hop's greatest group? - of course they are."
3,There is no way this album is 5 stars.,"I, like many of the reviewers have been a fan of Outkast since the first album and to say that this album deserves 5 stars is crazy. Some people have been defending this album by saying that this album shows the evolution of Outkast and how it is more great Outkast continued from there Grammy winning Speakerboxx. First of all, as a hip hop fan I can care less what the grammy's say. They do not know hip hop. Second of all this album deserves 2.5 stars. There are a few nice songs but the rest are average to poor. If this is the ""evolution"" of Outkast than I guess I will have to listen to there old albums when Outkast was actually a group with some purpose and not two solo artists putting together a hodgpodge of beats and raps."
5,This is one rare rap group who aren't afraid of change,"Man, I am lost for words....let me start off by saying how phenomenal this group is. I truely adore them because they don't compromise of something they aren't and dare to go a different direction in their choice of style. Face it, what rap group that delivers live instrumental folk, rap, funk and R&B into one album? Not many!!! Matter of fact, they are a class by themselves and they can not be duplicated. And most certainly, they are the only rap group I will buy."
4,You gotta admit..,"compared to all the junk that calls itself Hip Hop and R&B these days, it can't touch the boldness and creativity of Outkast. There is no current music out there you can compare to Idlewild. Its not as good as Stankonia but it definitely has its moments. The only problem I found is that there are too many songs on the album which makes a lot of the songs too short. Maybe some of the songs could have been omitted and the better ones expanded. If you are an Outkast fan this is a must have"
2,Wildly idle,"Aside from the silly film loosely linking the material, this could easily be considered a b-sides album of later-era Outkast- not the worst thing for hip hop in general but ultimately a big soggy bite into fan expectations of a genuine studio release."
4,Good but...,"i have to say im sort of distressed reading alot of these reviews. the people who rated this lower are probably the real outkast fans who have been listening to them since the early 90's. I notice alot of people on here just started listening to them after Speakerboxxx/The Love Below which is hands down their worst album (though its still great). So this is an improvement from that, but dissapointing compared to outkasts earlier work.."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"I could not be any more disappointed with the new Outkast album. I have been a fan from the beginning and they have consistently put out phenomenal albums...until now. This is yet another instance where the duo has reinvented their sound but it just doesn't work this time. First of all, their are far too many tracks on the album. Most of the tracks dont deserve a second listen as they are poorly written and produced. Even their current singles are lacking in comparison with their previous work. After Spearboxx/the love below, this work is simply embaressing. Perhaps, Andre and Big Boi should collaborate more as the best tracks are the four that includes both members collectively.Unfortunately I DO NOT recommend this album to even the most loyal of Outkast fans."
3,BEGINNING OF THE END,"REAL TALK..THIS ALBUM IS AIGHT. OUTKAST HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CONSITENT RAPPERS OF ALL TIMES THEY HAVE 5 ALBUMS BESIDES THIS ONE, AND YOU CAN SAY EACH ONE IS ARGUBABLY THE BEST ONE. NOT MANY RAPPERS HAVE A CATALOG LIKE THAT. BUT WITH CRUNK MUSIC RUNNING ATL, AND THE SOUTH, AND GANGSTA RAP, AND HYPHY MUSIC IN THE WEST, AND THE PREDJUDICE EASTCOAST RAP HAS AGAINST ANYTHING NOT EAST, IT LEAVES YOU THINKIN THAT OUTKAST, AND THIS SOUND OF THERE DOESNT HAVE LONG. STREET DUDES DONT LISTEN TO ALL THAT SINGING, AND THE STREETS IS TAKING OVER.OUTKAST WILL ALWAYS BE LEGENDS, BUT THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO BEING DOPE SOUTHERN MCS INSTED OF THIS CORN HOP, THEY DROPPIN."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,"I love Outkast, rushed to the store to buy it. Couldn't wait to get home and listen to it... so I opened it and put it in the car cd player and 1 track skip, 2 track okay but skip...3, 4,5 -12 tracks skip, skip, skip, skip. WTF. So maybe it will sound different in the home stereo sysytem. So go home and gave all the songs a solid listen and felt like somebody con me and stole my money. If it was atleast one good (top 20) song, I would be okay but this is Straight garbage... Mamma said if I could say anything good about a person then I should shut up... We'll hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
1,ANDRE PLEASE RAP PLEEEEAAAASSSSSEEEEE!!!!!!!!!,"ANDRE 3000 IN MY BOOK IS IN THE TOP 10 MC'S OF ALL TIME. HIS FLOW IS ON TARGET HIS DELIVERY PRECISE. I AM SAD TO SAY AS AN DIE HARD OUTKAST FAN THAT THIS ALBUM IS COMPLETE GARBAGE. DO NOT BUY IT UNLESS YOU ENJOYED THE LOVE BELOW. ANDRE I AM AN DIVERSE MUSIC LOVER IF YOU WERE A GOOD SINGER I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO JUMP ON YOUR SINGING BANDWAGON, BUT UNFORNUTLEY YOU CANT SING YOUR WAY OUT OF A BOOT IF THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE ON THE HEEL. PLEASE I IMPLORE YOU TO GO BACK TO YOUR ROOTS AND RAP,RAP,RAP. IT IS YOUR GOD GIVEN TALENT AND YOU HAVE ABANDONED IT."
4,Mighty ighty ighty iiiiiiiii,"....odie odie odie ooooo!!!!!! What can you really say about these guys. Their great!! They are the best rap group in the history of hip hop! In an era of complete unoriginality, Outkast continues to set apart themselves. This album is no exception. Keep in mind, IT IS A SOUNDTRACK, not a 7th Outkast album as some reviewers want you to believe. Even with that being said, this soundtrack possesses some of that old Outkast magic like ""Mighty O"", ""Morris Brown"", ""Idlewind Blues"" and the incredible ""Hollywood Divorse"" which features Snoop and Lil Wayne and yes, 3000 spits on this track as well. Very, very nice! I highly recommend all Outkast fans to go buy this soundtrack and even if you're not necessarily an Outkast fan per say, go cop it anyways. It's got something the previous 40 or so rap cd's released this year doesn't, originality."
3,"""God Don't Make Mistakes""","And this album is proof.....I wish their last project was this good. Andre 3000 is ripping this thing apart with them lyrics of his. Big Boi also to me has stepped up to the plate and is showing some lyrics himself. Yeah there's plenty of singing and different things going on outside your normal Hip Hip album. But this is Outkast, their name says it all they are not afraid to go out the box, and i'm lovin' it.The production is very good and the right instruments are used for the right songs. The vibe is str8 up wicked....go pick this one up!!! Hotep!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This cd was weird and horrible both at the same time! I can not describe my disappointment. If you really like Benjamin then you might like it, but if you love Outkast...don't buy it!"
4,Am I missing Something? This thing is great!,"Wow did this album get panned in a hurry. I almost feel like I'm listening to something different from all these other negative and mediocre-reviewers. It's untraditional and it's funky. 3000 doesn't sound forced - like some of the ""different for difference's sake"" which oozed thorugh so many of the Love Below tracks. Idlewild flows, it's complete, it's a cohesive story, it's well produced, and Big Boi is smooth and deep as ever. Put down that hatorade and pick up the love."
5,"OK, I don't think so","Sorry, but music is developing. One could even say it is maturing. Don't get me wrong, ATLiens is still one of my favorite albums, but this CD just shows the musical talents and capabilities of these two amazing artists. Don't trash talk this just because it's different. Honestly, you have to ask yourself, am I truly that threatened by change that I can't accept the direction my favorite artists are moving in? Come on people, this is a great album. Buy it."
4,Speakerboxx/ The Love Below Continued,"First things first, if you liked the last album, you'll like this one too. If you didnt like the ast album, then you probably wont like this one either. This album is more of Dre's experimentation with various genres of music (which I am a fan of) and more of Big Boi just delivering great verses. Dre does actually rap more on this album though. My favorite songs are:Hollywood Divorce feat. Snoop and Lil Wayne (probably the best song on the CD, I'm not a fan of Lil Wayne, but I love his verse in this song)Mutron Angel feat Whild Peach (slow ballad, almost churchy, its sort of a tribute to those affected by katrina and the tsunami, but it also talks aboutthe war too)Morris Brown feat. Sleepy Brown (the marching band beat is hot and Big Boi rides the beat well)Call the Law feat. Janelle Monet (another experimental track, but Janelle is great on this song. I actually heard her while we were both still in college and have been a fan of hers since."
5,Outkast is back,"'Kast sounds rejuvenated on Idlewild. With the huge distinction that they still each have ""solo"" songs, the sound is similar to their Stankonia days. The ONLY songs I weren't feeling were ""No Sense At All"" and ""In Your Eyes"". The rest of the CD is 'Kast at its finest."
3,Not they're best work but certainly not they're worst,"Continuing after the success of Speakerboxxx/Love Below is Idlewild. Its been a while since Ive heard Andre and Big Boi on the same tracks. This CD has a few of them on the same songs. First up is Mighty'O which, when I heard it at the time, I thought that the old 'Kast was back. Then after that song there was Big Boi and Dre going solo again. They get back together to do Hollywood Divorce with Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg( great verses by everyone on that one!), and they do 1 more together from the movie which I liked but cant remember the name of it. I loved the singing and all the jazz inspired tunes but what I really want,what I think everyone else wants is Andre Benjamin to come back to being a full time MC. The rap game needs him to spit knowledge to these kids. Hopefully the next album he will."
1,not feeling this hardly at all,"Outkast has made a album where it just doesn't even have one tight cut. there are some cool parts here&there,but this album is truly lacking. alot of these tracks sound like they been just lying around&just touched up. this Album is pretty flat."
1,A real diappointment.,"This is by far OutKast's worst album. I never though I would even be using the words 'worst' and 'OutKast' in the same conversation. Matter of fact, this was their only bad album. I am a die-hard outkast fan. Andre 3000 is my idol. However, I have to admit this album sux. I can't believe that Kast would even put out something of such low quality. They must of had a contract obligation to fulfil or something. I knew it would sound different because after all, it is an OutKast album, but damn, this Idlewild album sounds horrible."
2,"Disappointed, but loves Outkast","I purchased the Idlewild CD from another source, only to find that some of the songs I was digging on the movie were not selections on the CD. I wished I had listened to the samples before wasting my money.Of course, it was good coming from Outkast. But, I will sample before I purchase another CD from a movie.I loved their score from the movie, which enticed me to rush to pick up the CD. They are a talented bunch of brothers from my hometown-A.T.L."
5,What did you expect?,"The guys have done it again! This album is creative, innovative, and amazing. After remaining in the game since '94 with their first album each of the following release has pushed the envelope even father. Idlewild is no different. I've learned to expect the unexpected with these guys. And I can't wait for the next release."
5,"Good bra, works well for the well-endowed","I would describe the bra as comfortable. It keeps breasts contained without constraining too much. I've had it for about 3 weeks, it washes well without shrinking. I like it enough to have ordered a second one. It's not cheap, but is worth it. I recommend it, especially for other well-endowed women."
2,Chill?!? Not exactly.,"My idea of ""Chill"" music is Hed Kandi's 'Serve Chilled' or 'Winter Chill'--they're the BEST--or Cafe del Mar, Man Ray, or Budda Bar II. This is more like music for STONERS. Which is OK, if that's what you're looking for. But it's not my idea of Chill. Lots and lots of downtempo beats without much else. Pass the ganja, please."
5,Sofa King Cool indeed!,"The latest release from the Boys Diesel is possibly their best. It's hard, fast, and punk. Track 13 (Shining Star) is the best song they have done to date, it features a different kind of sound with a killer violin solo (seriously). The way they mix up the guitar riffs with new, inventive sound and style is exceptionally good."
1,Booo..Very Boo,"These pens looked So cute & Really beat the prices in stores---so I figured they were worth a shot. Nope...you get what you pay for here-or at least I did. Every last one was old and/or dried out. When they wrote it was splotcy, inconsistent ink flow & then, after a short time-out of ink. You could shake them, sit them pointing downward, draw circles til you paper rips--doesn't matter, they're done. TRASH"
1,Pet Cemetary II,It's was awful. Not at all like Pet Cemetary I. Too much cursing and nudty. I was very disappointed.
3,Watchable B-horror...,"...much thanks to the talented Clancy Brown fit as usual for his unsympathetic character. Pet Sematary 2 offers a few minor shocks, but nothing remembarable - it still manages to give the viewer an unpleasant feeling while watching this somewhat simple story being a typicall sequel in the horror-category. The effects mainly is the make-up of the bloody corpses rising from the dead, and it works as rather ""convinsing"". I've seen far better movies, but I've also seen worse. Mild mid-entertaining horror having nothing to do with Stephen Kings' original story, ok at its' best."
1,NOT WORTH THE EFFORT...,THIS SEQUEL IS NOT WORTH THE TIME AND ENERGY TO WATCH. NOWHERE AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE. THIS IS WHAT GIVES SEQUELS A BAD NAME.
1,No!!!,"Just like the ancient Indian Micmac burial ground there is no earthly, logical explanation as to why this movie exists. If you enjoyed the original or even the book then do yourself a favor and skip this facical, supposed 'sequel' created merely to cash in on a name.M."
2,"Something goes wrong, but what?","Actor Edward Furlong goes directly from starring in one of the greatest sequels of all time (T2 Judgement Day) to starring in one of the worse sequels of all time (Pet Sematary Two). The sad thing is that the movie starts out pretty good. For starters.. fans of horror will enjoy the excessive amount of gore. The heavy metal soundtrack works well. And the film is atmospheric in a macabre sort of way. The big issue is the last 25 minutes, the production value goes rapidly down hill. Even though the gore continues, true fans of quality horror films will be disappointed in the over all product."
3,Not as Good as the First!,"OKAY! You know the whole concept of the movie! Someone dies you bury them in the Indian Burial Ground. They once again are ""ALIVE"" this sequal though was weird! This Boy goes Crazy, Digs up his mother! Then expects her to be the same! Now if you saw the first movie then WE ALL KNOW! It's not the same person!"
1,Borring and pointless!!!!!,"This movie its such a waste of time!!! my sister and I saw this movie last night!!! we were really bored, its a pointless movie, bad acting, it's just horrible!!!!! it will never be as Stephen kings original Pet sematary!!!! if you wanna see this movie see....... ummmm lol!!! just don't see it!!!!"
3,"Many cliches, but quite creepy nevertheless","I saw it on cable sometime around Halloween and though this little flick does have some yucky parts, it still has some Hollywood stereotypes like the female characters looking and acting more like ditzy teenaged sisters than real moms to the two young heroes in this story. And one of the kids (the chubby one) also bears a striking resemblance to Spanky McFarland, one of the Little Rascals. Though I didn't get to see the very beginning of the much-promised sequel to the original Pet Sematary, I did get to witness such gross and sometimes sadistic parts where the revived body of a dead dog wreaking a very bloody havoc at the veterinary, sobbing little boys struggling to bury the cold, gray coprse of ""Spanky's"" mean old cop stepfather, and the airheaded young stepmom's eye getting viciously gouged out by what looks just like the ghost of an old-time Hollywood starlet and things like that. Weird, but quite an interesting Halloween viewing nevertheless."
1,STUPID SEQUEL CRAP!,"No wonder Stephen King did not want this to be released. This movie is stupid. The original did not need a sequel at all. We all expected better, considering this was made by Mary Mambert, who made the original Pet Sematary. This is crap, so do not buy it."
2,Don't bury more sequels in the Pet Sematary,"Better save your money and don't waste it with this DVD. If you are interested the cheaper option it's to rent it. There's nothing new in this film that wasn't previously seen in the original movie, so it's really boring and from the beginning to the end you know what's going to happen."
3,The original Pet Sematary was much more creepy...,"Mary Lambert did a much better job on the first Pet Sematary. This one was ok, but I would recommend you buy the original... and maybe see this one just for fun. The original Pet Sematary should not be watched alone and night;-) It's also a really good adaptation of Stephen King's book ... And after you see the original don't expect this one to be as good, cause it's not."
3,Entertaining,"Although not exactly a classic, this film is nonetheless quite entertaining at times. The whole cast is good, but Casey Brown steals the show as Gus. He appears to be having fun in the role, and he's fun to watch. PS2 is creepy, it's goofy, but it's entertaining."
5,It's a funny and scary at the same time,I liked it very much. You can see a horor film and still see a funny film at the same time.It' a movie I think everyone will enjoy.
3,"It a ""not so great"" Sequel",Kinda disappointing when you compare to orignal....more gruesome TO gruesome!
2,THE SOUNDTRACK IS GOOD. THE MOVIE IS A JOKE.,"The only redeeming value in this so-called ""sequel"" (that King had nothing to do with, mind you) is the soundtrack, featuring heartfelt power ballads and thrashing punk anthems. The movie itself seemed like just an excuse to push the gore envelope around for a while. Earns two stars for the soundtrack and Clancy Brown's performance as a dull-witted, mean-spirited law enforcement official. Otherwise a total waste."
3,"Decent sequel, but excessive gore.","Mary Lambert, who also gave us the first movie, shows how imaginative and unrelenting she can be in the horror she unleashes in her movies. She crosses the line, however, with certain distasteful scenes,i.e. the kid getting hit by the truck in the first movie. It's like she's saying: ""I don't care if this is considered personally incorrect or in bad taste; I'm still gonna show it!"" I have to admire her for her boldness. Definitely the best female horror director. Wish she made more movies."
3,All in all okay,"Didn't have the same effect as the first and even though it had a pretty good story line with lots of colorful characters, it was stupidly gory in parts and had bad special effects that one could laugh at. But it wasn't a waste of time to watch, it was interesting and even worth watching again."
1,Overly disappointing sequel,"It's amazing that with Mary Lambert at the helm of this sequel to her richly chilling adaptation of the Stephen King novel that this film is as emotionless and empty as it is. Anthony Edwards and Edward Furlong play a father and son who move near a familiar pet cematary after a tragic accident. There's no point in going into the overall story, because the screen writer sure didn't put too much thought into the story himself. Animals and people die, they get buried, and then they come back rather homicidal. This goes on for a while, with some nice gore effects, but it's all rather pointless. Clancy Brown (Highlander, HBO's Carnivale) is at his usual psychotic best, but he's lost in the middle of this schlock fest. All in all, this dismal sequel can't come close to how good the first film was, and is better left on the scrap heap."
1,A bad sequel.,"Stephen King is the master of writing, and when he wrote the original story: Pet Sematary, he was on his game, in the zone, and THE MAN.This second movie is someones attempt at cashing in on the original works of the King, and has been poorly done.Did, Stephen write a second novel? No. He has so many other stories that they could make into movies, why spend the money on something like this second film. It was a dive-bomb in theaters, that should tell you something.Bad--Just bad."
2,Gross and nothing else,"This second film by Mary Lambert, on a screenplay that has nothing to do with Stephen King, is a gross remake of the first one. All the elements of depth of the first film have been erased and annihilated. There is only one thing left : the grossness of the living deads and their only desire to get even with the world, to get their vengeance. The only interesting situation at the beginning of the film is the quick exploration of the relations among teenagers (boys only please) and the constant fear and hassling that the bullies impose on their unluckily willing mates. Apart from that the rest is gore, blood, gross special effects and at times unbearable artificial tension. This film has nothing to do with Stephen King's imagination, even if it carries a Stephen King title. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."
4,FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE,"ORIGINALLY I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FIVE STARS BUT I THOUGHT FOUR WOULD BE RIGHT.I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE AND THE SPECIAL AFFECTS MAKEUP USED IN THIS FILM, WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS DVD I REMEMBERED I CANT WAIT TO WATCH ANY COMMENTARY BY THE CAST, BUT INSTEAD YOU DONT GET NO COMMENTARY BY ANY OF THE ACTORS OR BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE MOVIE WHICH WAS BAD, AND IN THE MOVIE WHICH WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SEE THE BOYS BURYING GUS TO BRING HIM BACK IF YOU LOOK PRETTY CLOSE YULE SEE HIM FLINCH WITH HIS EYES AS THE DIRT GETS THROWN UP BY HIS FACE LOL. THIS MOVIE REALLY MADE NO SINCE TO BRING CLYDE BACK TO KILL THE LEAD BOY WHY NOT BRING DREW AND AMANDA BACK AS THE LIVING DEAD WITH GUS SINCE DREW STARTED THE WHOLE THING. SOME OF THE STORY LINE DIESNT MAKE MUCH SINCE BUT ITS STILL A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE. ENJOY :-)"
2,Better,We find the same low-key movie about a pet cemetary that just happens to be built on an ancient indian burial site. In turn everything that is buried there comes back to life with a curse on them. Although it is much better than the original adaptation of Stephen King's book it is no were near a well made Horror movie.
3,Christmas in Herald Square,"I heard Christmas in Herald Square on the radio. The singing isn't so good. Not sure about the lyrics, but the ""Ho Ho Ho"" bothered me. I'm kind of a Tony Bennett fan, but that's based mostly on recordings from longer ago. Ignore the three stars. I can't really rate the entire CD. I'd give Christmas in Herald Square a 2."
2,no to happy,"We have a broken part and called little tykes went through a little snag with them about where purchased and what part broken. Didn't receive the right part YET! so really can't play with it. Some stickers had been taken off paper and not sticky so need stickers too. Seems to be very durable except for missing parts, but all in all my son was so excited and happy he got a Diego jeep only thing he asked for and searched for it all over internet and got the last one!Thanks Amazon.Mari WeltyOhio"
5,Another Dave Galey gem!,"If you want to learn all about the benefits of owning your own bus conversion then you'll love this book.Dave Galey covers many aspects of Motorhome ownership from air conditioning,books to the best products suited to motorhoming.This is book is an ideal companion book to his book titled:""The bus converter's bible:how to plan and create your own luxury motorhome""""(2nd edition).There are other books on bus conversions/motorhomes/motorcoaching available from amazon."
4,Bob The Builder Four books in one!,This was a gift to one of my little cousins who is seven or eight and learning to read on his own. This is a fun filled book that even had me interested! I liked the fact that it was a big book so the words were easier for him to follow.Thanks!
5,Brilliant Zep pictures; brilliant book,"I cannot speak highly enough of this publication. A lavishly produced, superbly presented and packaged 335 page book, divided into 23 chapters each of which features a different photographer's work. The pictures themselves, both colour and black/white, are of a consistenty high quality. Covering the entire span of the band's existence, the rare and often-candid images effectively capture the group on and off stage. In particular, several detailed shots of Zeppelin in front of massive stadium audiences are simply stunning - a true reflection of their immense popularity. Thank you Ross Halfin, and good luck to anyone else lucky enough to obtain a copy!"
3,Product Good Service stinks!,I agree with the person who has the band that wore out. After multiple emails where I was told to call a number each time and each time I called that number I got a voice mail and no return call.I have had the monitor for a about 2 years. I too had a dead battery at the start and once that was changed the watch has worked well for me. I agree that it is heavy but I am hard on watches and have not had any scratches due to having glass instead of plastic face. My only complaint is the total lack of service.
3,Dead Battery,"Having heard rumor that the company has not made this device in some time, I contacted tech. support. They confirmed that was the case , but stated that over the last six months they had been replacing batteries in thousands of units and anything on the market should be ok. Guess what? Mine came with a dead battery. This was replaced at no charge."
3,cases break,it also fails because of the case breaking off the little 'ears' that hold the band oni;ve broken about 8 of them nowridiculousat least [...] takes them back every timei finally got a pro 9 metal from themwle.
2,Battery died after 2 weeks.,"I'll make this short. This is a decent product that fails because of the battery life.Two weeks of use and the watch battery dies. The user manual directs owners to send the watch in to have a ""technician"" replace the watch battery? WTH?Make a product that can be user serviced."
4,Horrible game- But what's to expect from THQ?,"I am a big fan of Rocket Power, and by god, this game sucks eggs! To unlock everything, all you have to do is answer these questions that even a baby could answer! Come on, do you really expect us to even FAIL at answering these? And even worse, even if you don't decide to cheat, the game is way too easy. The controls suck, but who cares? The game's so easy, you'll give the game a big beating anyway! And the graphics are so ugly, Otto looks like a brown rabbit! Then again, what can you expect from THQ, the company who screws everything up? Word of wise- Nick, take the gaming license away from THQ, and give it to some other company more responsible!"
4,stinky stinky POOPOO game,Zis is vorstHans has ever seen. Hans thinks zis game is dumb. Buy turnips from Switzerland instead. YOU VILL NOT BUY ZIS GAME!
3,its ok,me and my sister got all the way to the last leavel on mondomountion then it got way to hard so i would buy it we dont play it much anymore buy the two towers to :)
5,Rocket power beach bandits is no Tony Hawk but it is good,"If you want extreme sports. this is not your game. but if you want a easy adventure game this is your game. the game takes a long time to complete even if it is easy to beat. you will get more than your money's worth. It does not get difficult untill you have to defeat Golem Senior at the end. This can be easyly done if you use the right button for ""lock on"" and get the ""rapid shot puck"" from the end of a beam under the platform."
2,Really!!! Thats all they got??,"Me and my brother got the game for ps2 and thought it would be pretty fun since we loved the show... but when we first started playing it it really disappointed us. The game play was pretty bad and the story drag on too long with simple missions that bored us and it really was annoying having to go into the menu to change characters/vehicles. THQ didn't impress me very much due to bad graphics and 2nd rate game style!! Bottom line is I don't recommend it to people people who are used to playing other extreme sports games, and i don't believe they made the best attempt to make a good game this time!!!"
3,Rocket Power,Feels like you are going around in circles to complete different task but other than that it is ok.
1,Swiss quartz? How can a $500K watch not be automatic?!!!,"Amazon should make clearer that this is NOT an automatic watch. I mean, I only realized this after the armored car delivered it at my home a couple of days ago, and now Amazon want to charge me $75K ""restocking fee"" because it is not technically ""defective"". Any watch over $500 that not automatic is defective for me, not to mention one a thousand times more expensive. I tried selling it in the black market, but no body wants to pay over $10K for a ""quartz movement"". Shame on you Amazon!"
1,Was probably dashed off in a day.,"The author probably dashed this book off in a day after leafing through a few other business start-up books. The suggestions for start-ups are very, very sketchy and mostly unrealistic unless you have a lot of capital and/or specific knowledge of that business."
4,Classic TV looking great,watched this with the enhanced effects and it looks excellent. Well worth a purchase for Star Trek fans.
5,He's dead Jim,Great to have this free and available in an instant. Way to go Amazon! The production quality for 1960's was superb and the rest is legend
3,Volume low?,"Introducing my kids (5 & 7) to the world of Star Trek. They are mesmerized despite the somewhat slow pace of the episodes compared to today's movies. One thing though, the volume on the main menu screen is nice and strong but when an episode is selected the volume goes WAY WAY down. So far down I can't hear voices unless I crank it up. Does anyone else experience this?"
4,How does it getany better than the original,"It is the original series, how does it get anybetter than this? Since cildhood I have enjoyes the series and still do."
4,Oldy but goody,"Have really enjoyed watching these! A bit pricy, but worth it in the long run, they never show this kind of good stuff on tv anymore!"
5,One of the best,"I wasn't much of a trekkie before I bought this, but I am a true believer now! With the improved picture, improved sound, and new special effects, this will help bring in those who shunned Star Trek previously. The picture quality is spectacular, and I have been extremely impressed with the clarity of the sound. The new special effects also help eliminate some of the show's cheesiness. Star Trek is a great series, and this is easily one of the best blu-ray releases thus far. If you're sitting on the fence on this one, and you're wondering if it's worth the money, it definitely is. I can't wait for season 2 and 3!"
3,What can I say,"The acting as bad as I remember, the props are very campy and the aliens are extremely simple suits worn by stuntmen."
3,Dangerous Adolesent with powers!,"This episode deals with a very young man who is both cunning, and innocently likeable at the same time. Charlie's ignorance of 'human bedhaviors' causes eruptions for him emotionally, and crew members begin to disappear.It takes a rather long time before Kirk and Spock to figure this out; which was exasperating to me, since we are talking Starfleet Academy Officers here. Kirk should never have been personally involved with this young man, let alone permit him access to the Bridge? Why do all alien guests receive a visit to the Bridge??..NOT SMART.Jim ~"
2,Episodes out of Order,"Although it is real nice having the set in one package, it is a shame that they did not have the foresight to think we might want to watch them in the order they were numbered, i.e. episode 2 before 3, 3 before 4, 4 before 5, etc. They are on the disks in air date order, which is not the correct order, if you want to watch in actual order, you must juggle between disks. Wait to purchase until the idiots at Paramount get it right. Maybe this is why sales were not so good and went from $129 - $199 per season to less than $40.00 per season."
5,"""Very Good Mr. Ears!""","Star Trek is, without a doubt, the best series television ever had. It had the best overacting I've ever seen by the great William Shatner, the best cheesy special effects, and truly very good writing, considering the lack of special effects. This classic first season, which aired on NBC from September 8, 1966 to April 13, 1967. introduced us to true Sci Fi Star Trek Rulz Get this!!!!! I would if I had the money."
2,Ludicrously overpriced,I don't care HOW improved the video quality is- there's no way a single season of a television show- especially a 40 year old television show- is worth $200.
3,A nice package...,"This looks like an incredible package, and might, like the Twilight Zone Definitive Editions, become ""the"" set to have for Star Trek Fans - but the price, which has been cited in reviews, is definately a bit steep - I spent two birthdays and a Christmas getting the $124.99 sets in Standard Definiton only to watch the retail on all 3 drop the following year to half the price I was gifted for.At Amazon's discount price, it's definately THE way to buy the set. I've seen some of the remastered episodes as well and they're definately neat to watch.But at full price? I'd wait."
2,CBS-D HAS BUTCHERED THIS SERIES,"There is no reason to ever label the effort by CBS-D as amazing. Out of Paramount's cheapness they chose to turn this project over to an in-house crew that has as much talent as a 6-year-old. The HD transfer is about the only thing that makes this a restoration; certainly not the video game effects.In contrast, Eden FX madea two-parter for the series Enterprise that showed what TOS should have looked like. ""In A Mirror, Darkly is it's name. Check it out."
3,This isn't what I had in mind for HD,"When I saw the announcement for this, I was skeptical. The HD concept was created to display movies at home -- large and widescreen with good enough resolution to avoid distraction.This is a TV show. Even though paramount says it was remastered, it must have been shot in 4:3 format. This HD version is still 4:3. Why pay a bunch of money for improved resolution? So, you can use the zoom feature and fill the black, side-bar area? I don't think so.I LOVE Star Trek and have watched all the series for years. But, I would never pay money to get the original series UN-formated for high-def, widescreen.Stop playing around and get back to putting widescreen material on HD-DVD!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Screwed Again!!,"Well, I guess if you are a loyal Star Trek fan the studios feel as if they can just screw you over. Yes, I bought a HD DVD player ONLY for the first season of Star Trek which was released ONLY in HD format. Well, guess what? I'm stuck with the Betamax of DVDs. Hey Paramount!! How about giving the loyal fans who bought the HD versions a price break!! Oh, never-mind, that would be good business."
3,Simply not worth the price.,"$80.99 is just too high for a show this old. Sorry, I know Star Trek is beloved by millions including myself, but I don't love it that much.Here's to hoping that production companies finally wake up to what's going on in the world and release these at a more realistic price."
3,Way too expensive,"As much as I'd like to buy this, there is just no chance I'd spend 81$ in just one season of a TV show. One can only hope the rest of the Star Trek BD releases are not so over-priced, and that this one comes down fast."
4,Star Trek Fan,"As a long-term fan I welcome the special effects updates, but I was hoping for a higher quality of cgi. Still the effects are an improvement over the original."
4,High quality release,"This a really cool box set. You get all the classic episodes remastered and in blu-ray quality. What really put's it over the top is having all the episodes in their original format or with new, updated graphic effects. The new effects are excellent and never go to far to take away from the classic feel of the episode."
4,Great Product in a Small Package,"This is the best quality of the original Star Trek series to date. I bought the double episode discs as well as the previuos season series DVD's and besides the convienance of needing less space for storage, the Blu-Ray quality is superb. The discs can be viewed with either the original graphics or the new computer generated graphics which encompass mainly exterior shots of space. I think if I were to wish for an improvement, it would be for a wide screen version that would fill the entire screen. Amazon did sell this at a great price for which I am greatful."
4,To Bodly Go with New Effects,"I must admit that I have haven't viewed these in HD yet. However even in standard definition (on a 56 inch screen) the new effects are amazing. Just the shots of the Enterprise orbiting planets leave me awestruck. Yes, I have my opinions about why they didn't do this or that. So far though I am happy with effort they put in. I have noticed that Star Trek DVD's are more expensive across the board. I was willing to pay the Amazon price without too much discomfort though."
4,"GOOD ,NOT PERFECT","First let me get right to the point.If you are a Star Trek Fan then you must get this set...priced a little high, but if you're a fan this wont matter...the remastering is not perfect ....you will notice that they missed quite a few frames.....but again if you're a fan this will not matter much.....BUT I DID EXPERIENCE SOME LOADING DIFFICULTIES.....to the point that I had to make a return because of this......two out of the ten discs were simply not loading no matter what I did.....I first thought it was a player problem but the player was fine....I was using the xbox hd dvd player.Which by the way I gave an unfair review because I first thought it was a player problem......everything is now loading fine ....one or two discs need to be loaded twice before it kicks in.....but hey I'm a fan."
5,Star Trek At Its Best,"Shore Leave is one of the best episodesof the classic series. It uses all thesci fi props but also has a great story,if you don't even care about Star Trekand have to watch one, watch this one."
5,Great classic scifi!,Quality was great. Really love the old Star Trek episodes. This was the series that opened the door for space oriented scfi series.
5,The greatest show ever!!!,"The remastered is actually really cool. The stars are so vivid now! But what really matters is this show is as great as ever. It is neat watching the episodes in order, I dont' think I've ever done that. 28 episodes in a season makes for many fun evenings."
4,Star Trek: original series in blue ray,"This is the first season of the original Star Trek series presented in Blue-Ray. The great thing about this set is that it includes two versions of the re-mastered episodes: one as was seen originally, and the other with enhanced special effects. Included are special features, such as the how the show was re-mastered, as well as commentaries about the individual episodes. It's also nice to see a straight forward, elegant set without all of the awkward packaging that is sometimes found with other box sets."
3,Paramount needs to take a few lessons from Dr. Who series.,"I am one of the crazy few who bought the initial 40 volume DVD release of Star Trek TOS. I don't regret the purchase as I enjoy the series very much, but I do regret the obvious difference in price versus what I originally paid for the series.I don't feel that bad about not getting the box set though after hearing what I have heard about the lack of re-mastering or poor extras on this release set.I've encounter a few problems in the first season release of Star Trek the Next Generation as far as video quality as well.Paramount could learn from a the Dr. Who series. There is a team of fans who work at BBC that restore old Dr. Who episodes and they do a WONDERFUL job! I've seen old B&W; footage that looks brand new as if it was just shot. I'm really to pay extra money for the Dr. Who DVDS because I know I am getting a high-quality product. Too bad Paramount doesn't treat ST fans with the same respect."
4,"Of course the content is fantastic, but the packaging. . . .","No real need to comment on the high-def first season. It's swell. However, it took me three times to get a copy of the first season that did not arrive with the bluray case shattered. I finally settled on one that came just cracked, and not totally broken. And the first season did not come with the pretty little slip cover, so it won't match season 2 and 3.But if you don't let the minutiae bother you, you will without a doubt enjoy the content!"
2,What Happened to the Sound Level???,The picture looks stunning and makes this purchase worth buying. I'm not sold on the special effects as yet. I think there's something so special about the original effects because it was done with real models and there is an artistic-ness in that alone. Thankfully both versions are available which makes this set worth buying.I am very disappointed in the sound level of these episodes. I have to turn my volume up to max on my TV to hear them the way I'm used to watching movies. I don't know what's going on. The preview for the new Star Trek movie sound is loud and great but the playing the episodes sound is way too weak. Switching back to the original episodes soundtrack helps but not that much. I'm using a Sony PS3 game player to play theses blue rays.
2,Far too expensive,"I was really looking forward to this being released. When I first read the Amazon page, I thought the price was for the entire 1st series. Expensive, I thought, but the Amazon discount brings the price down to a reasonable level. Then I read it was only season 1. Come on; this is far too expensive. I dread to think how much it will be in the UK when it is released there."
1,Star Trek: City on the Edge of Forever,My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon. It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television. Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD.
2,Took a good thing and made it bad,"I'm a Srek fan for as for back as I can remember and when Paramount issued Star Trek TOS entire first season, well I was overwhelmed. WhenIt finally came in the mail I had it opend before I made it through the door asd as I stood there in horror my heart sank faster than a starship in a decaying orbit. THEY DIDN""T PUT THE EPISODES IN AIRDATE ORDER!!! I almost fell out. I thought to myself how could they mess that up (not the word I want to use)I have to give this DVD 2 stars for that (FU) aside from that I love TOS and all the other series"
1,star treck season 3 original series,"i was sent a region 2 copy of the series. i ordered region 1. when i notified the seller he did not accept it was a region 2, though the disk was clearly marked region 2. he stated i was sent a region 1. he asked me to send it back and he would need to verfy he actually sent a region 2 to me. though the item was originally sent on time it was frustrating to return to this seller. i have been notified that i will be given a refund."
3,Never realised thier were 29 episodes in season one alone,"They were spit'n them outta the factory like crazy in those days, not like now where it's five or six per season and a pat on the back to the overly pampered actors and actresses. I liked the original series best, but it didn't actually start getting good until season three or so. Just because it's Star Trek doesn't give it an automatic five stars. Though even in its infancy, it's better than Voyager or Enterprise by far! The first season of the Origial series was kind of silly and I am glad they soon got rid of Yeoman Rand. That relationship with Kirk and Rand was just too corney(the same could probably be said of Enterprises's Trip and The vulcan girl, what's her name).. The only two I really liked for this STO first season were the ""Where No Man has gone before"" and ""The Cage"" with Jeffery Hunter and co-starred Susan Oliver and was actually not a TV release at all and is not on this set."
5,Even better than expected,"As a kid, Star Trek wasn't something that I watched all of the time. I got much more into the show via the movies. So watching this Blu-Ray and marveling at the quality and all of the extra features has made the experience a total joy. Watching Season 1 after viewing the new movie just added to the overall enjoyment. I truly appreciate the care and attention that went into remastering this jewel for the BD format."
4,What is HD DVD?,The digital and graphic enhancements are great. Disk has a duel side. One is regular DVD and the other is HD DVD which I haven't found anything to play it yet. Season #2 and #3 wisely dropped it. They did not give instructions to load the disk label down to play DVD. I thought the disks were defective.The price is finaly affordable! Great viewing.
4,ok,Little dated but grandkids that are new viewers liked it. Everything is new to them but they love this even though its a little slow for me.
5,Classic,"This is clearly one of the best shows ever made. If you don't like Kirk, you'll like Spock. Or McCoy."
4,Which set should you buy? Try rolling the dice!,"As an owner of all 40 of the 2-episode discs, I've always wanted to have all three of the ST:TOS clam-shell sets but bristled at the though of buying something I already had. But with each set presently priced at a reasonable $35-55 each I finally made the leap. Each season set is uniquely packaged in a colored plastic clam-shell case with the DVDs stacked in a clear-plastic holder with a sleeve that I'm sure will not hold up all that well. The insert with content details is a nice touch.Great quality; a bit of a pain as they are not in the order of broadcast. This $35-55 range is fairly reasonable. But just how many times are they going to release this series? This is as bad as the Twilight Zone!"
5,Older Gets Better,"I found the ""clean-up"" of the original series very well done. The newimages of the Enterprise really bring the series up to date. Im hopingthat someone continues with restoration of the remaing seasons in some formor add the new images to standard DVD for season two and three.I have the original first issue DVDs and still watch them. The added HDspecial features are very informative and worth owning both versions. Youcan still purchase an HD player at a very low price. Get this combo before they are all sold out and you wont regret it."
5,"Buy, Buy, Buy","For those who have not previously purchased the VHS tapes, the video CD version or the 2 episode per DVD set, this is the best bargain (in comparison) of all of them. Yes, it was irritating to purchase the VHS tapes and then find out the set was burned to DVD, and now it's irritating to find that 15 or so boxes of the 2 per DVD set will be burned to 1 box with 8 DVDs. In 50 years, I'll be irritated that they've been etched onto a 1"" square chip in DV holographic format with 24 channel sound. But I'll still buy it. And you will too."
5,Fantastic!,"I can't remember how quickly the product was shipped, but the case and all the DVDs were in perfect condition. I bought them new, so of course this is to be expected but doesn't always happen. I absolutely love the Star Trek series for the dynamic and comical trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy; the cheesy but often inspired story lines; and the endearingly low-budget set and costumes. I don't really love some of the ""upgrades"" made to the show in recent times (such as the redone graphics to make the various planets look like actual planets rather than rubber bouncy balls; and the addition of the occasional shuttle craft landing in the landing dock which were never present in the show as it was when it was first airing, etc., dinting the cheesy quality a little), but they don't bother me so much as to make me not spend money on the series. I basically just think they were totally unnecessary.Anyway, I am totally satisfied. Great product!"
5,NOTHING beats the REAL DEAL!!!,"Debated on the newer ""improved"" release, but the uniqueness and improvisation of the original tapings are best experienced in their original form. This has some unique features that can be activated to give more background information of the show as it runs, which I really enjoy!! Bought all three for my husband for Christmas so I'll follow up on 2 and 3 as we view them. We like that it stops between shows so we can read about the next one and run for break between. If you love the show, these Original broadcast copies are a MUST!"
2,ALERT TO THE HEARING IMPAIRED!!,"I cannot even tell you how excited I was to finally have bought the remaster edition. Look at the Amazon listing....it says ""English Subtitles"". Well guess what.....there are none. It has FRENCH and SPANISH...but NOT ENGLISH. Someone at CBS or Paramount or whomever actually made this for the ENGLISH speaking AMERICAN market needs to be shot. And Amazon too, since they incorrectly list this.I am hearing impaired an need subtitles. The non- remastered edition has English subtitles-- which I already own. The clarity looks so good on the remaster, but sadly I cannot hear much of the dialogue or read the actor's lips when they are off cam and speaking. A huge blunder and disservice to hearing impaired / English speaking fans. This error far exceeds the stupid dual sided disk, where you cannot tell what episode is on each one.I am sure people without hearing problems will love the remasters......"
5,Amazing! Just Buy It!!!!,"The picture quality is absolutely amazing - you really have to see it to believe how good it is. I was a bit worried about the enhanced effects I heard they were doing - I really thought it might alter the ""feel"" of the show. I couldnt have been more wrong! They really knew what they were doing here. They enhanced some of the effects and re-did some of them [like shots of the Enterprise] using CGI instead of models to make it look more ""real"" and more in line with what we're used to today - BUT they did it totally in line with the look and feel of the original show. Watching this I really thought THIS is what Gene Roddenberry would have done, if he could have. This is really the way Gene intended the show to be seen.I can't imagine anyone who wouldnt be happy with this - as for the price - well, this kind of upgrade doesnt come cheap - but I thought - if you are a ST fan - it's well worth the money. I cant wait for the second season to come out."
5,good updating for this classic show.,As a life long Star Trek fan I was glad that they put this show out on blu ray. They even give you the option of the updated special effects. Season one really changed society and tv as well. Many of the ideas of this show inspired real scientists too. It's a classic show and well worth owning. The blu ray picture was loveningly cleaned up and the show has never sounded or looked better. Sadly the movies on blu ray are just didn't get this treatment. Noone can explain why either. Still grab this blu ray set if you love this show because it has never been better presented than here.
5,Perfect for Star Trek Fans.....But....,Eagerly awaited this blu-ray set for a long time ever since the originals came out as HD/DVD and then just regular DVD sets. There's not much else one can say other than for $64.99 at the moment of writing this it's too good to pass up. My only complaint so far is probably due to my own lack of understanding or owning a HD TV but for some reason my picture is stuck in a box. It's black bars all around making the image a box and not stretched to fit the screen let alone in widescreen. Is there a way to watch it without this way or was this just how these were made?
5,One of my favorite episodes,"I skip the mindmeld scene that starts around 35 minutes. If you've never seen the whole episode, it may be necessary to endure it, though."
4,no pilot,"I love the 1st season dvd box set. The only real problem I had with it is that they dont include the original pilot called ""The Cage"""
2,"Steep Pricing, Great Episodes","The 1st season of ST:TOS, which includes ""Balance of Terror"", ""The Menagerie"", ""Space Seed"", ""City on the Edge of Forever"", and several other of the best episodes of the Star Trek universe (featuring Klingons, Gorns, and superbeings of all sorts). I won't go into the quality of the episodes, since none can argue they are the greatest ever to be aired on television.Now, the DVD. The special features- interviews, scene selections, nothing over the top- are great...if you're into such things. Me, personally, I like to listen to interviews, etc., but it's not for every one.The one thing that REALLY bugs me is the pricing. I mean, all of the ST box sets are outrageous, but that's still no excuse for a price of ninety-ninenty ninety-nine for a set of 24 episodes when most such collections are around $40-60.Don't get me wrong, the episodes are great, but the price makes all the difference. Sadly...not recommended."
5,I love this collection...,I love this series collection. The playback has been clean as well as the audio. I've been eagerly anticipating its arrival and am not disappointed.
4,Very well done re-issues.,"There's no pleasing some people... various ""reviewers"" are content to whine, complain and nit pick about packaging. The episodes in the ST:TOS box sets look FAR better than the TV re-runs, and the Dolby Digital audio is miles above the original Mono VHS soundtrack.You have to remember that this show is pushing 40 years old now. There's only so much the engineers can do to clean up the original source video and audio. The Okuda commentaries, bonus features and interactive menus are very well done, however the menus can be a little clumsy to navigate. That being said, you get used to them fairly quickly. The original TV previews for each week's episode are a nice touch.These sets are a little expensive, and the packaging isn't the best, but a couple of $1.99 Ikea CD-Wallets solves that issue. It's still FAR cheaper than buying the original 2-episode per DVD issues."
3,No Pike?,"I got up and left after starting disc one to write this. I am disappointed seeing Kirk in Ep. 8 as the 1st show of the box set. I do understand that this is the airing order but I thought this was an all encompassing set; pilots and all. I feel a bit short changed as I have been waiting for this, like most people, for a long time so I can get the whole back story."
2,Paramount sticks it to the fans again,"Over the years Paramount has charged more than any other studio charges for box sets but being a fan bought them (TOS, TNG,DS9 and Voyager) anyway, reluctantly, because of the high price.So what does Paramount do when they have run out of Series priced at over a hundred dollars a pop? They start remastering the original show and hike the price up even more. This is for product that has essentially been released already so why not a substantially lower price? They want a higher bonus for Christmas this year?The effects themselves? Pretty darn cool and this is coming from someone who thought they would distract from the show itself like Lucas' effects in the Star Wars movies when he redid them.If you have the money, buy them I guess but would rather people Not buy them so Paramount will have to lower the price."
5,Star Trek Season 3 Blue Ray DVD,Product arrived in condition as described and delivery was prompt! Would use this seller again.
2,Can do without HD,"HD sounds like a good idea, but which one! Is HD worth the extra cost in any format? I have over 1000 DVDs (including the standard edition of Star Trek Season 1), I'm not about to purchase my collection again in a new format. Standard dvd has proven itself. I believe this collection is a poor value. Considering I already own the original effects version, I'll wait for the remastered episodes to be released as a stand alone set and in Standard DVD.Review Update 5-11-2009: I finally purchased this set now that the price is reasonable. The episodes look great. I'm quite satisfied with SD quality. As we all know, HD-DVD is dead and Blu-Ray is the HD of today. It figures. After doing some research, I found that HD-DVD was better than Blu-Ray. Compare Beta to VHS: Beta was of higher quality, but VHS held more video, so it won. I'm going to stick with SD."
2,What!?,"I am in complete agreement with the other posters. If this was the ENTIRE original series the price would be acceptable. OR, if this was the first season featuring both the original and the new Special Edition versions then maybe. But no way is a ""special price"" of $81.00 for just the original 1st season in any way reasonable. Got it on DVD and that's just fine. At least they got the price right for the Original Movie Collection.I've bought a TON of DVDs and Blu-Rays on Amazon over the last few years and I know the prices are generally the best found so this wouldn't be Amazon's screw up. The studio actually expects people to pay this amount. I guess we'll have to wait and see what is available on this set. If it is literally the original first season as available already on DVD with a few new bonus features this set will be a laughing stock at the current price. Let's see what happens."
1,Discs would not play in two players!,I tried these discs in two different Blu ray players and they would not play in either one. I was disappointed.
1,Over Priced !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I realize that this is seven disc's...But...Blue Ray is WAY WAY WAY Over Priced. I have this on the original release and it was over priced. Is the difference in Blue Ray and original worth it?...In my opinion HELL NO. This is simply a gimmick to steal your $ I rated 1 star for the price...Not the content.
1,WTF!?,"Whats going on here!$80.00 dollars,for what?I have all three seasons,yes even Season Three,on DVD.I bought the episodes I liked when there were only two on one disk for $20 a pop!Love Star Trek,old school,but not that much!"
2,Problems with the sound!!,"I bought this because I wanted to replace my standard DVD copies and I love the star trek series and I will buy each of them as they are released on blu-ray, however I am writing this review because I have read most of the reviews that others have left and not one of them has touched on the problem that when you play an episode in the enhanced or original effects the audio drops out completely. At first I thought that it was limited to just the first disk but no I played an episode that was on disk #4 and encountered the same problem. I also bought a copy of this from borders and encountered the same problem so now I have to return both of them! I was playing it on a pioneer player, which is considered to be one of the best players around! I am planning on waiting until the second release if there is one so that this problem can be addressed."
5,Price is way right,"You gotta be kidding about the price too high .I think I paid around 130.00 for the hd-dvd combo version .All I have to say is BRING ALL the seasons on !!!These shows are really good , and most hold up great over the yearsI've watched them ...Also the job they did restoring is top notch !!Am glad they are doing these ...........Peace out ."
5,Brings back great memories!,"I enjoyed the show when it aired originally in the late 60's and when I watched the re-runs after Star Trek TNG in the 1980's. I have not seen the show in nearly 15 years and it was as good as I remember it! I do not like the fact the DVD will not play the shows straight through, rather you must re-select the play mode or return the main menu with the titles on the view screen. Really a minor complaint that I found on all three seasons, but one I can live with! :) If you are worried about the high price, I was... It is worth it. All the Star Trek shows are ""too-high priced"" Ouch :( and I am sure most of us agree. Hint for you Paramount! :("
3,issues with sound quality,sound dropped to a whisper then back to normal over and over in some of the episodes. the early trek episodes were a little rough. keep watching. it gets better.
2,"If they're going to spend all that money on unnecessary ""upgrades""...","I can appreciate the fact that they took it upon themselves to repair the film where it was damaged. However, they overstepped their bounds and violated this classic by adding effects and shots that were not in the original."
4,I now know for sure that Season 3 is my favorite ...,"... although there is some great stuff here.I love the original Star Trek. All of its successors pale in comparison. Sure, The Next Generation had its moments. Even Deep Space Nine had a few doozies. But the rest? Junk. The original Star Trek was a study in terrific storytelling -- great television on a par with The Twilight Zone.The great episodes in this volume include Balance of Terror (one of the all-time greats, I loved how it intruduced the Romulans in a deadly cat and mouse battle) , The City on the Edge of Forever (despite all of Ellison's tired carping, a much better version than his unedited original screenplay), Space Seed, Return of the Archons, and Where No Man Has Gone Before.The quality of the video and audio is amazing, and you'll find yourself glued to DVD after DVD."
5,Like watching it for the first time,I have always loved the original series and over the years have watched them over and over. When they put the first season out on Blu-ray I had to buy it. I never realized that they remastered the original and added new footage I was amazed! It is like watching it for the first time. The sound is ok and is low at times but the picture is amazing and when you switch from original to enhanced you really see the work put into these Blu-rays. I cannot wait to get the next two seasons.
5,Amazing colors!,"The trailer for the new Star Trek Movie alone would be reason to buy this set, it looks incredible. The added special efects to the old series add to the Hi Def look and do not detract from it at all. Most of these are improved planet views and an enhanched Enterprise. The sound is somewhat muted as far as the voices go, but the music is very good. If you enjoyed the original series you will be able to relive your youth again this time in Hi Def.http://www.startrekmovie.com/"
5,star trek remisterd edition,this was easy to order & was cheaper than buying it in the store. my husband loved his birthday present.
3,Bad Sound,"I really love this Season of Star Trek but I really the sound of the enhanced and the original version of the blu rays. But at least, unless the season one in dvd, the blu ray disk make us choice if we want to watch it with the enhanced effects or the original ones. So, despise the sound, the blu ray version is better than the dvd version."
5,In 1998 . . .,"Twenty bucks seemed reasonable for a feature length disc. Times have certainly changed since then. Now let's talk shop.These episodes are in air date order. One may note that The Man Trap and Charlie X aired before Where No Man Has Gone Before. Visible details, due to this, is the costume and set designs. But chronological issues aside, this show doesn't require any order of viewing.My favoite episodes this season were; Miri, The Menagerie, Arena, Space Seed and The City on the Edge of Forever."
3,Star Trek Blue Ray,"The new features are great but I do miss the pilot episode ""The Cage"" that was included on the dvd set and the commentary by Gene Rodenberry I wish had been included on the Blue Ray but over all worth it."
4,"Just the basics, please....","I have just finished watching the release of the Blu-Ray edition of Star Trek the Original Series, Season 1. First off, let me say that the colors are clean and bright and I found the sound to be improved over previous releases. That said, the menu leaves a lot to be desired. You cannot select a specific episode to watch because there is no episode menu. You have to watch them one-by-one. The picture only takes up 2/3 of the screen so you have this annoying chopped-off look at the sides, and this is in wide view. As another reviewer states, the discs are blank and do not list the episodes presented on each disc. Overall, I enjoyed it, but thought that some things could have been better."
3,Like the upgraded special effects,I like the upgraded special effects and information. I would give it five stars if the discs did not stop playing or losing the sound tracks all of the time.
5,Star Trek Memories,Watched the 1st DVD - was amazed by the picture quality and sound - well done!!!!!
5,Some people here need to read before they post.,"Read Cpt_Kirk's review, a few reviews down, that will explain to the confused reviewer why the episodes seem out of order. They are in order but in a special way. Just go read the review."
2,Expensive and few DVD extras.,"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?As a TOS fan I had to get season 1, it's the best season of a great old show, but I won't be buying season 2 or 3. The price of the set is about twice the normal price for one season of a TV show. Given the price and the cult status of Star Trek, I'd hoped to see lots of extras. Instead it was a pretty skimpy transfer to DVD IMHO.Only 4 episodes (counting Managerie as 2) have optional text trivia tracks. How hard would it have been to include them on all the episodes? Given how much this syndication has been milked by all involved over the years, you'd think somebody involved would have volunteered to to an audio commentary track or two. I guess they were too busy pursuing their writing and singing careers.The plastic case is original, but not very convenient.For some reason, the episodes have a tendency to default to closed captioning."
5,I'm a geek,"I love star trek (classic) Spock is awesome he is a stud muffin. It's sort of funny how captain Kirk falls in love with another women every single episode. It's clean, no cuss words and you can always count on captain Kirk to be dramatic"
4,Worth money if you MUST have your Star Trek!,"Packaging, cool. Menus, sorta cheesy. Quality of video and sound, awesome. Worth it if you MUST have your Star Trek!"
2,great buy,Well worth the money. Excellent quality. Sound and picture could not be better. Recomend this to all Star Trek fans
5,A Perry Mason in Space Episode,This is one of my favorite episodes because it is not just about action and strange new places. The plot is good and there is a great surprise twist at the end. It still has the typical Star Trek drama and the Captain fighting the bad guy but with a little more Perry Mason added in space.
3,Good set but what's up with Kirk's low voice in the opening?,"I'm loving the episodes (most of them).The sound within the episodes is ok. The picture is clear, and the new effects shots are great...the show really benefits from the CG additions.BUT NOW FOR THE BAD (or atleast annoying) - I'm only watching the DVD versions and Kirk's voice is relatively LOW in the opening - ""SPACE...THE FINAL FRONTIER...""! (I don't have an HD player)[...]How can Kirk's voice be so low (and have a weird echo) and they call this ""remastered""? This after all the trouble they went through re-recording the music and adding in Kirk's original dialogue which sounds normal on the bonus disc preview.Oh well. That's my only real complaint.Aside from that I still recommend these highly."
3,It fnally worked....,"I was not able to watch the movie with the Viewer on my PC but it did work on my laptop. It only took two days to get everything worked out. I was also able to view Part 1 and some of Part 2 of the Menagerie with the latest version of Winamp on my PC. I still love the original Star Trek shows. Yes, they do look hokey by today's special effect standards; but hey I grew up watching them. Because of the hassle with the Viewer I could only give a 3 rating."
3,"Okay overall, but...","Lots of disc quality problems: freezing playback, disc read errors. The sound of the shows was much lower than the sound of the menus, leading other people in the house to yell at me between episodes. I agree with others that the menu is hard to figure out when all three episodes on the HD-DVD are not listed at once - and for no apparent reason. My package from Amazon arrived with broken plastic pieces. The case was hard to open, and it was impossible to remove the inner case without putting fingerprints on the first DVD, which had nothing covering it. However, the new effects made the episodes better. You no longer had to wonder how a purple or pink blob of a planet could support life. I probably won't bother to get season 2 or 3, since even the best special effects could never make up for the poor scripts."
4,Worth Buying,"If you are a Star Trek fan, and especially if you are an original fan this is worth every penny. I've only ever seen the original series as reruns on TV and I was truely shocked to see these on Blu Ray, the quality of the picture is way more than I expected from a series this old.The only gripe which I took one star off for was in the sound as others have mentioned. They could have put some more effort into equalizing the sound. Turning the volume up so you can hear the dialogue will result in being blown out of your chair when they cut scenes with music or throw in sound effects. Turning the volume down to where the sound effects are acceptable leaves you completely unable to hear the dialogue."
4,Awesome,"The first season of Star Trek is pretty much awesome. It has lots of great episodes on it, and it will rarely disappoint. However, the double sided DVDs are really annoying. They get smudged so easily, and its always the side you need. (Say, if you don't have a HD player, and need the regular DVD side.) But besides that, it's nice. It comes in a little nice box-y case. Also, the remastered-ness is a little distracting. Added new computer generated sequences aren't even that great and seem completely out of place. I personally would prefer the old cheesy special effects. They may be dated, but it gives it that feel of nostalgia."
4,Still good after all these years,"The new enhancements are great! My only complaint with this set is there is no master list of episodes and what disc they are on. However, die-hard trekkies like us are ok with that, just put any disc in and enjoy."
5,Star Trek,"Prompt shipment, item was as represented and of high quality. I would purchase future items from this supplier.I have been enjoying each episode of this season."
4,Combo Version AddsTo The Price,"Blu-Ray fanboys, please go elsewhere to chat. This is a place for reviewing the HD DVD version of Star Trek.Remember Combo discs cost more. You pay a premium for them even if you don't want the dual format. This set is a little high priced."
2,A Complete Cashectomy for your Wallet,"I've seen some of the remastered episodes and they are fantastic. That being said, over $400 for 77 episodes is a unbelievable ripoff. If you have an XBox 360 many of the HD episodes are avialable for download for a couple bucks. That will have to suffice for me until the price comes down to a reasonable level."
4,A Must Have,"Finally The real Star Trek has arrived. This is a must have for all fans, although the cost is a little high. If you are a fan you can't miss it."
2,Are these the 1960's version or the 1970's syndicated versions?,Anybody know? The last box sets were the 1970's syndicated versions. The 1960's versions had more material to watch. Anyone remember when SciFi did a special run of the truly uncut 1960's versions? I'm hoping this release has that runtime...The price is pretty step regardless considering I just bought the complete standard def box set for that price about a year ago. I don't own a hi-def player so HD-DVD doesn't really appeal to me right now (I think Blue Ray will become the standard anyway so it will be re-released again in that format).I'll wait until it comes down to around $70. Still step but less of a gouge.
5,rating for content not packaging,"I love this show, and it's fantastic that the full seasons are finally on DVD.I love the content of this set, but not the packaging. Many others have expressed the same concerns, but I feel like the booklet attached to the disk case will eventually tear, even with careful use.The video quality is unchanged from the previous DVD releases (at least as best I can tell - I only owned a few of the 1st season 2fers...I assume the rest are the same quality).The sound quality is greatly improved over the 2fers, with Dolby 5.1 giving the subwoofer a jolt here and there as required.My only quarrel with the contents? I would have liked audio commentaries from some of the principals, or at least text commentary for all the episodes, instead of just a handful. I thoroughly enjoy the commentaries.All in all, I'm happy with the first season and very excited about getting season 2. Season 3? Yeah...I'll pick it up used!"
4,Here's a simple concept to to justify the high price...,7 Dual-Layer BD-50s.Those aren't cheap by any means (price any blank ones lately?) and there are 7 fully-loaded discs in this set. I'm not a Trekkie (my friend is) but this is certainly a good value for what is offered. I'll probably check it out for th 7.1 HD audio--not going to get that on DVD or HD-DVD.
1,FIX THE PROBLEM OR NO MORE ORDERS FOR ME,"I PAID FOR THIS INSTANT VIDEO TO BE DOWNLOADED TO MY PC ITS NOT IN MY WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER OR MY UNBOX -SO NOW IF I WANT TO WATCH IT I HAVE TO GO TO AMAZON .COM LOG IN TO MY ACCOUNT AND THEN GO TO MY VIDEO LIBRARY AND HOPE ITS THERE - I DONT"" KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE DOWN LOAD NORMALY A SMALL WINDOW WOULD POP UP AND LET ME KNOW ITS DOWN LOADING -IM"" VERY UNHAPPY AND I WONT"" MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING ANY MORE INTANT VIDEOS FROM AMAZON!!"
4,Such a great series,I really enjoyed the first few episodes and the special first program that was used to sell the series. It was nice to see the characters and actors change and evolve over the first few episodes.
4,Nice to see the old shows,"The picture is clean, but the sound, especially in the opening ""Space the final frontier...."" is very week and not at the same level as the rest of the shows. Unfortunately, it is the same on every show of the season."
3,as good as it ever was as far as content,"the shows were grainy and some audio glitches were present. I realize that the shows are old but did not anticipate such poor quality of video. Maybe i am being too picky, but thats why the 3 stars."
1,Why not buy the real thing?,"Dear God this is horrible, just buy Rancho Deluxe. If you have to have a tribute CD get ""Sharp Dressed Man"" at least Hank III is on that. Imagine Warrant(shudder) playing ZZ Top covers at a bad lounge in Lutz Florida on 80's night(which they probably are) and you've got the flavor of this disc."
2,Paint by Magic,"I first read this book when I was in fifth grade. I thought it was the best book I had ever read. I picked it up again in the sixth, and I thought it was horrible. I thought it was badly written, though I could not tell in the fifth grade. I didn't get a feel for the characters either. I thought that they said ""freaky"" way too much at the wrong times. They really annoyed me. I did, however, love the plot. It was so creative and gripping. This could have been a better book."
3,Paint by Mediocre Magic,"The idea of an 11 year old boy traveling back in time to save his mother was an interesting story line. However, the characters and plot could have been better developed. I felt like the story was told too quickly and that more details could have been provided for the reader instead of waiting until the last minute to fill in all the plot. Overall, the story was very creative, but could have been better organized."
3,Better Than You Would Think,"When I saw the title, I was extremely sceptical. The story revolves around an 11 year old boy named Connor. One day his mom is randomly acting very strange. He gets whisked back to the year 1926 to save his mom, and himself, 80 years before they are in danger. I found the story cliched(save me from the ""evil powders""), and not one bit scary or disturbing. The author didn't seem able to construct a good atmosphere in many seens, and also poorly done emotions. Despite these flaws, I enjoyed paint by magic. I think this would be best for a 9 year old, mainly because they would'nt notice the authors sometimes just plain bad writing. Still, it was enjoyable and I think it is worth reading."
4,Liked the Massage and Cocktail Scenes,"My Wife is a big Mercado fan, so I pre-ordered it, and gave it to her with some flowers (you gotta keep um happy!). She loves to cook, so she got the best of both worlds- her Walter Mercado plus ""food."" I gave it 4 Stars because, I liked the massage segment, the drink segment, and the bathtub segment, but the food dishes seemed a bit complicated to me. I cannot picture my wife using a ""blow torch"" to make me dessert. She would probaby burn the entire house down! I like the female co-host, and most important, I liked the fact that such a simple DVD could make my wife happy. So thanks for that."
1,A Stain to the National Lampoon name,"One of the WORST films ever. A real piece of Junk. It just rambles on. NOT FUNNY. One star is too much. It is like a really bad SNL skit that goes on for over an hour. It is just work to watch. In the beginning you think the film will lead to something if you give it a chance, but it doesn't. You will wear out the fast foward button on your DVD controls, and turn it off before the end, because you won't care what happens next. I love B movies and even C movies, but this is way below them. I will never trust the National Lampoon brand name again. Use the DVD is a frisbee and you will enjoy it more."
2,BUMMER,"What a title ! Building expectations to something interesting....instead you get a disdainful pieeece. They tryed but failed miserably. I forced my self to watch for maybe half the movie, but felt so cheated for the wasted time. I could have been washing my toilet. Very possibly the poorest result ever put out on film."
2,Guess I'm in the minority.,"I found this movie to be pretentious, idiotic, and not at all funny. I caught myself wondering what sort of person could actually get intrigued by this. It's not tongue-in-cheek enough to be campy, and it's not subtle enough to be satire. It was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief and swallow the idea that this was happening in a far future devastated by nuclear warfare. I expected that at any given moment the camera would turn and reveal the entire film crew, complete with the director wearing a hawaiian shirt, sitting in his chair under a beach umbrella, and sipping a fancy cocktail. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The beginning animations were interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes it disintegrated towards total boredom. I couldn't last past 45 minutes. A complete waste of time. If you want a morbidly funny/bizarre post-apocalyptic movie, try Delicatessen."
3,2 different chaplets available,"There are two different (at least) Chaplets of Divine Mercy in song available. The original (traditional) was more of a chant. I think it was sung by Vinny Flynn and his 2 daughters. This is NOT that version. I found this version boring and so slow that I wondered what the woman was singing. I only lasted for a few minutes. Will give it away and try to buy the first version. I am sure some people prefer this one, but everyone needs to be careful to order the one they prefer."
5,Love their music,I saw them in Sedona and feel in love with there music. They are indescribable together and as a solo artist.
3,Above Avergage,"It is quite typical - neither does it dip below your expectations nor does it rise above. In the end, you get your money's worth."
5,scratchers,"Inexpensive product which really attracts the kitties to use the scratcher instead of furniture. I change them out every year, and they work."
2,Cat does not like.,My cat never scratched this. He turned it over a couple of times. I would not recommend this.
1,not a real scratching post,This is not at all a scratching post it is cardboard with holes in it the only reason my cat looked twice at it was because of the cat nip. This was a HUGE waste of my money
1,Disappointed by the quality of the product,We initially received this product and one of the legs was broken. Therefore you could not raise or lower the product. The company that we received the product from was great and they sent us a replacement feeder at no cost and paid for shipping. The second feeder was worse than the first. The screws that held the legs onto the feeder were rusted and several of them were not screwed all the way into the base. The black color was peeling off of the product which I am sure had it gotten wet from filling the water dish a few times would have completely peeled off. I was very disappointed in this product. I was very satisfied with the company that we went through to purchase the product. Great customer service.
2,don't buy this if your dog weighs more than 20 lbs.,"I have 4 retired racing greyhounds. They weigh about 80lbs. This is not the table for bigger dogs. The legs on the table are extremely flimsy when extended all the way and even though there were other reviewers that discussed the same thing, I bought two anyway. I tried to figure out a way to stabilize the legs once they were extended but the way the fitting is on the legs I can't really do that. This table would be fine if you didn't have to extend the legs. I couldn't believe how much some of the other feeding tables were and thought I could get away with cheaper....guess not"
3,Fun to watch Brian's journey to date Drew,"I really enjoyed this home movie of Brian's date with Drew.This documentary is like anyone of us making a movie with a tight budget.The ending is great,and Brian's excitment to have his date with Barrymore almost brings tears to your eyes.I would just like to know what happened to one of his friends in the film that died? That was very sad to see when I was reading the credits at the end."
5,Adorable!,"This is such a feel-good movie! Leaves you with a smile on your face and insipired to take risks in your life. You fall in love with Brian as you see him take this journey. Not to mention how great Drew Barrymore is! If anyone has any misconceptions or negative ideas about her, this movie will definitely change your mind! I love it and highly recommend it!"
2,DOCUMENTARY!! NOTE: DOCUMENTARTY!!,"WARNING. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE. IT IS A DOCUMENTARY. Many reviewers called this a movie, and I must not have read the Amazon reviewer carefully as I was surprised it was a DOCUMENTARY. It was o.k., but somewhat boring to me till the end when the date with Drew Barrymore actually took place. Just want others to know what they are getting if they order this."
2,More a 3 out of 6 stars really...,"...but this is not a movie I'd recommend for rental. It is perhaps something I could swallow easier for a rainy nights' TV-watch, the concept however is not worthy of a movie (or documentary or whatever you'd call it). It just carries on with the reality-tv-fact; Anyone can get famous, just do something weird... and tape it!On the other hand I must say that ""My date with Drew"" has it's moments. Witty moments, it's never hysterical funny or even close. It is stupid funny, nerdy, and obviously ment to be. But all along I felt that this was just about making a movie, not a true fans' charming story of meeting his big idol.So ok at its' best, nothing remembarable. Or even especially original!"
5,most people in the world have bad taste,"The ONLY reason the Muffs aren't as huge as the Beatles is everyone in the world at least right now has completely cruddy taste. The Muffs are quality, beautiful and have great songs. Why more people don't know about them is basically very telling about the pathetic state of mind of music right now. Alert Today Alive Tomorrow is a better record than the pathetic public deserve."
2,Overall a Disappointing Effort. Creatively Bankrupt.,"I'm amazed that many reviewers give this release such high praise, the only stand-out single on the cd is Prettier Than Me. The rest seem to mesh together in a most uninspiring way. I loved the debut effort from this band(nearly a decade ago!) and if you want to hear a 4 star effort that's the one I'd recommend. I hope the next release(if there is one) consists of more substantial tunes without resorting to cover songs as in Hamburger."
3,A Pretty Little Fluff Ball,"Although I found the writing to be charming at times, I really didn't find it to be a compelling read. The characters are all self focused, rich and rather dull. There were just too many scenes of the characters drolly sitting around eating peach mousse with their pinkies extended. I never cared about any of the main players, and too many colorful non-plot-essential characters breezed through the pages. I need a bit more grit than this pretty little fluff ball gave me."
5,Still holds up,"I first read excerpts of this enchanting story in Cosmopolitan magazine years ago. I like the excerpts so much that I bought the book. And re-read it and continue to re-read it at least 4 times a year. It still makes me laugh feel good and my heart pound. I've only lent it to a selective few, keeping tabs on it like a hawk. Simply put, my favorite book of all time."
1,Ho-Hum,"While I normally prefer a book with more depth and edge to it, I nonetheless also enjoy a feel-good, happy-ending story now and again too! Fair to say that the reviewers' adjectives on the back flap of Happy All The Time -- 'fun', 'clean', 'healthy', and 'delightful' -- should hardly have led me to expect anything more than a squeaky-clean romp of a weekend read. Unfortunately, the only thing this book left me feeling was why I bothered to read it to the end. This insipid book neither captivates nor is it particularly well written. The four main characters are like cardboard cutouts and for 214 unremarkable pages, we are led to nothing more than a ho-hum, isn't-life-grand-as-long-as-you-can-afford-champagne ending. Please! Whether your literary interests tend toward the light or dark side, there is much better out there than this for the taking!"
1,vapid and inane,"I probably should have put this book down when I was halfway through it and I realized it was about the tiny problems of several self-engrossed upper class New Yorkers. I found the plot to be lacking in any sort of stimulating element; the book basically boiled down to two people finding their perfect mates. Furthermore, the characters seemed somewhat flat, since everyone is describable in a couple words, and the dialogue strained for snappy wit, but instead came off as silly to me. My problem with this book wasn't that it was light and happy, it was that the book didn't even do a great job portraying light and happy."
5,An Excellent Introduction!,I show an episode of this series to my high school students once a week. It is an excellent introduction to the green movement and has opened their minds to new and positive ways of thinking about our environment and how we affect it. This series is not a doomsday downer but offers a whole range of solutions to take positive steps.I highly recommend this for the classroom or home.
1,"Zero should be the rating, but it's not available.",I am very disappointed. I have been a customer of amazon for many years. I placed an order this afternoon in error and within 20 minutes was told I could not cancel the order because the shipment was being PREPARED. It had not shipped mind you and was not going to ship anytime soon. I was told to expect delivery in 14 days!! What is up with this? I will not order from amazon again!
5,A breezy read with emotional heft lurking behind the laughs.,"I bought this book for a friend who is planning her wedding and ended up reading and thorougly enjoying it myself. The writing is clever and funny, and the narrative kept me turning the pages to find out what was in store for our bride next. What really struck me, though, and kept me engaged on a more emotional level, were the deeper issues behind the silliness--the repercussions of being a child of divorce, struggles with body image, family politics--that often surface when one plans a wedding. I related to Jorie's story on many levels and look forward to reading the novel that, considering her wit, talent, and insight, she is destined to write."
3,a bride definitely in overdrive,Bride in Overdrive is a diary of author Jorie Green Mark's Path toward Marriage. The reader gets to learn her inner-most thoughts and share her encounters with pre-marital brattiness. Her anticipation for the worst case scenario is combined with comedic overtones. It is not just herself trying to plan a marvelous wedding. Her story includes her best friends and extended family members and also an extraordinarily wonderful future mother and father- in- law. All contribute to fulfill her most lovely wedding day. The author does seem to possess a conceitedness about getting her own way - which at times she unabashedly admits.
3,This is a good game.,This game is good for big kids and little kids. It is a pretty challenging for little kids but easy for big kids. This game has good characters.
4,Good listening,"Charlie Louvin sounds like a man in his eighties but that isn't a bad thing. His voice aged with years conveys the same message in his songs that young Charlie did when singing with his brother Ira. I purchased this CD because I heard him singing Ira and that song alone is worth the price of the CD. I don't know if the songs are the kind that the modern Country fan will fall over but if you are like me and just a bit older then you will love it. If you like Hank Snow, Mac Wiseman, and the like then just as I do you will appreciate not only where Charlie is coming from but also where he has been. Keep doing it Charlie I love it."
4,Disjointed but interesting set of essays,"The book is a collection of disjointed but interesting essays on the general topic of equity derivatives. There is a heavy US bias in the material and none of the topics are covered in much depth. Nor does there seem to have been much in the way of editorial control over the way that essays are linked to form a theme (the treatment of covered warrants is a clear case here).One to get if the company are paying since, in a book this big on a sparsely covered topic, there is some interesting stuff here."
2,Beware,"I have found Ivo Pogorelich either inspired or infuriating. In this instance the later was the case. For me, his Chopin dragged until it was distorted, its melody lost and the contrasts between sections damaged. So if it is the Chopin you are looking for, I'd pass this one up."
3,EZ Label replacement Tapes,Work fine; they are replacement tapes for a Casio Unit that I have had for about 10 years. These are fine!
5,Great for young kids!,"My four-year old boy plays the tape constantly. His favorite track is J-E-S-U-S. The songs are brief and don't get tiring after many, many plays. Some are familure, and some are new, but all are fun and energetic. Its great to see him so involved in tape. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed with CD. The beat reminds of dance music, and I refuse let my four-year old granddaughter listen to it. I thought I was buying ""praise"" music."
5,Beautiful Cabinet,Heavy duty cabinet and well made. A little time consuming to assemble. Would recommend as a great storage or craft cabinet.
2,"TIPPER GORE - Activist, Authro, Photographer","This book is...OK, but it's not what I expected. It's rather elementary, both in content, length and especially in presentation. It looks and feels like a short children's book, and the binding is that of either a child's book or a small cookbook. With three areas of her life and work mentioned in the title, it barely skims the surface of any of them. There must be better books on Tipper Gore out there somewhere."

2,Not the best of Weingartner,"This issue is valuable only as a curiosity. The ""Hammerklavier"" transcription shows how past generations misunderstood the true nature of this sonata and the necessity of a keyboard to convey its sense of struggle; an orchestral arrangement merely smoothes things over. The 1933 Fifth Symphony, usually included in the issues of the Weingartner Nine, is a pallid shadow of the volatile British Symphony recording of a year earlier. This is the only set of Weingartner which I do not find of interest, much less of enjoyment or illumination."
2,"Nice Product, but no NT or W2K support.","I ordered this product, but I'm returning it due to the lack of NT4 or Win2K support. On their support pages, they say they don't have plans to release NT drivers for it. They plan on supporting Win2K with the NomadII whenever that ships. So I recommending waiting until the next version of the hardware comes out before purchasing the Nomad.From what I could test, the FM tuner seemed to work fine, and the sound was above average.I was a little disappointed in the case that comes with the Nomad. It was just a nomad-sized bag with pull-strings at the top. Also, there is no belt clip."
3,Record companies promoting SDMI through reviews?,I love the Creative labs Nomad 64 even with its couple of flaws which are -lack of USB support / Awful Nomad manager and MusicMatch software - although there is an update as of 2000 that improves it a lot and not enough memoryI don't care and won't care for SDMI as long as it does not interfere with the way I've gotten used to using my MP3 files - Right now as far as I understand - SDMI will be an option for the user to choose and not come preinstalled for example on the new Nomad II.Creative Labs makes the best players as far as I am concerned because they have the cool look and feel plus they have an FM tuner which comes in handy when you are tired of listening to the same limited number of songs because of the lack of more memory
4,A good MP3 Player with some problems,"This player is great for the money. 64 MB of RAM is enough (about 20 songs) and the voice and FM features are also pretty good. I didn't like however the parallel port interface. I have a printer, scanner and ZIP drive on my computer and have to unplug them to use this device. This was a very poor design by Creative. There is no extension port on the cradle to run it on the parallel port. Also, the rechargeable batteries are an annoyance. You always have to use them if you are using the cradle and I do not like them. Other than that I am pretty happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone."
3,Limitations,"I recently got a Creative Nomad MP3 player, and after installing the Nomad Manager Software, I get an error message Docking Station not conected.The parallel cable is properly connected.I actually have Windows 2000 and the software that comes with the mp3 player, says that it is for Windows 95 98.I have looked in Creative's Web page and there are no drivers for windows 2000, I also change the Bios settings as the setup instructions manual refers. With no results ."
2,NOT UPGRADABLE,"I bought the Nomad and began using it. I was very pleased with it and when I jogged or biked everyone questioned what this little device was I was using. Naturally, they became envious. However, I experienced problems with the flash card. I called tech support 6 times. All 6 times I recieved no help. So, I finally called Amazon.com who helped me greatly. BE WARNED...YOU CAN ONLY USE MP3 FILES ON THE NOMAD...this means YOU CANNOT UPGRADE IT IF MP3's become outdated. 64MB IS THE TOTAL MEMORY! I bought in exchange the Diamond Rio which has 64MB ONBOARD rather than 32MB on board and 32MB flash. Overall, buy this if you wanna use it for another 6 months to a year. If not, I suggest the Diamond Rio."
2,Great Gadget that does not work under WinNT,"The Creative Nomad looks good and feels good. The sleek design, 2x32 MB memory and the FM tuner - the added useful feature - made me go for it. Back home, where I run Windows 95, I'll be able to regularly refresh the Nomad with all of the wonderful music I legally ripped from my own CD's. While travelling, I am confined to a laptop running on NT. Hence, FM tuning is all I get on the Nomad until I get home (I do not really like listening to my own voice). It's not that Creative led me on to believe it worked under NT, but, well, Winamp and all the other run-of-the-mill MP3 players work just fine with NT. As I can rip my favourite songs from my CD's, I just thought I could make my Nomad work. This begs the question whether I should have bought the Rio and have had the benefit of Elena's RioShell....? But that is no credit to Rio. Anybody out there developed a Shell that makes the Nomad work under WinNT?"
2,Fair to Moderate,Overall this product fell below my expectations. The FM tuner is difficult to use and program. It also has a habit of losing your pre-sets. The volume output of the unit is not adequate. The software is easy to install and is intuitive in its use.

3,"Slow downloads, low battery time, no backlight","Hey, compared to the Rio500's USB interface this sucker is slow as can be at downloading thru the parallel port! That's one of the most important features, if you ask me! And the rechargeable batteries only last 4 hours or so, compared to 8 to 10 for the Rio. It's nice to be able to keep plenty of batteries on hand instead of always making sure the batteries are charged. I guess if you can't afford the Rio 500, this is cool. The Fm radio is nice."
5,i love this item,"Ok, if you want a good portable mp3 player get this one. Here are the pros and consPROS not that expepensive for 64mb, sounds good, voice recording, FM raido, comes with docking station and Ni-MH rechargeable battrys, erase button on the side, hold button,CONS slow transfer time, buttons are too small for my fingers and sometimes I press other buttons by accadent, half of the memory is a smart media card (which dosen't bother me much),battery life is short about 3 hours, no back lit screen(which doesen't bother me much),the pros outweigh the cons so I suggest you buy this mp3 player."
4,"poor manager, can't work under windows 2000","the software is poor, it don't support windows 2000. I think this is a big fault of this player. who know if there is some other software can take the place of the one came with the player?"
2,"Corrupted tracks, first day","Purchased the Nomad player yesterday, it includes a single removable 32mb disk, 32 mb on board, and I purchased an additional card... loaded it up with a handful of my favorite mp3's... Last 2 songs in players memory come out fuzzy and distorted.. first song on the first of the two smartmedia disks unplayable, I tried their customer support half an hour on a toll call before I gave up..curiously however when I tried their 1-800 # 'customer assistance' line which ""cannot provide any technical support"" I had less than a 30 second wait to be told to keep trying the toll #... Great idea, when it works it has decent sound, and I love the combination of FM tuner , and voice recording. However, returning the one I bought and looking for another option for a player as the bevy of problems this one has already given me in 24 hours makes it a definite no go."
5,Excellent film,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. Danny Aiello is amazing in this movie. The characters all have their humorous quirks that make this move one-of-a-kind. The humor that this movie has is classic, the dialogue is fresh and insightful. I have seen this movie at least twenty times and I still laugh at the same parts every time. I am suprised that this movie is rarely on TV because if it does get on TV, many people will agree."
5,No special effects and all heart,"A must see for all Danny Aiello fans. He is at his most down to earth in his role as the blue collar everyman from Queens who forgot how to dream. Anthony LaPaglia co stars as his son who does nothing but dream and despite all the odds, makes them come true, not only for himself but his father. This movie also contains one of the most uplifting and almost too good to be true endings that leaves its audience totally satisfied."
5,great movie a must-see,Love the movie brought back many memories of my childhood.. Shows the good parts of family life that is missing today...Aielo was great as usual..
3,The Honus Wagner of videos?,"I loved this movie and would watch it again and again for the pure entertainment, but can't understand for the life of me why the DVD is valued so much."
5,Diamond in the rough,"One of my all time favorite films. This movie is the best kept secret around. I am not one to rave about movies unless they can spark my emotions. Either make me scared, laugh , cry or cheer. 29th street has the last 3 of these in abondance What an fantastic film. The real icing on the cake is that its based on a true story where one of the actors IS really the person who this all happened to! Everyone I show this to never heard of it and then thank me for sharing it with them. Impossible to find, but if you locate it....buy it regardless of the price!!! ""We did it, Frankie!!!!"""
4,Oldster and Youngster,"These are beautifully modulated and well-thought out, fairly romantic versions of these great concertos which can easily assimilate more than one point of view as to interpretation. Bernstein seems exceptionaly well-behaved and less dramatic than usual, seemingly simply enjoying the hell out of the music. Zimerman is simply wonderful."
2,Haven't I played this game before?,"Madden 2002 was my first next-gen football game and I loved it. The graphics were great, the gameplay was next to none. As I got better I noticed that I can dominate the CPU using just 2 plays the whole game on offense. I was so hyped up about Madden 2003. Expected huge improvements. But, as I started to play Madden 2003, I noticed something. It's the same game! The graphics are almost identical. And, that's right, I started using those 2 plays again and I dominated. What a waste! Does EA think that they can just make a great game, then clone it and update the rosters and add little extras and add a year to the end of the title and expect to keep their fan base? Well, I guess they do. And, oh yeah, the commentary still stinks! By far the WORST commentary of any sports game (as it usually is with the Madden series of football games)."
2,Average Game,"I played NFL 2K2 before but I gave Madden a chance with the 2003 rosters. Madden has more features like old school teams, practice, drills, card trades, etc but if you just want to play with your buddies on or offline nothing beats the tackles and hustles of Sega NFL 2K series. The tackling is hard in Madden, there's no slamming or effect on the tackle. It's plain. I still can't figure out the audible.In Sega NFL 2K, you just press a button to call an audible and a list of optional plays will be displayed for you to choose. In Madden, nothing appears I guess you are expected to know the sequence of play from the controller buttons.This is the last time I'm buying Madden."
4,great game!,"The graphics are better all around then in '02, and gameplay is much more realistic. The mini camp addition is great!"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"For all of you discerning, intelligent gamers out there, please heed my advice and skip Madden 2003 and go for NFL 2K3. Madden is quite simply one of the most frustrating football experiences you will ever endure. First, unless you are the Rams, forget about a running game. Second, you will discover very early on that the only way to beat the computer is to hail mary every throw to the streaking wideout and then pray on defense. The computer simply scores when it wants to, no matter what scheme you throw in its face. If you like 72-63 games, then this is your title. If you like a modicum of reality (and fun) then go with 2K3. The learning curve is steeper, but ultimately it delivers a better experience. Madden is all marketing and not enough game. Oh, and 2K3 looks and sounds MUCH better. Madden looks like it was conceived on a PS1."
2,Overrated!,"Very dissapointing. No season mode and the graphics are terrible. NCAA 2003 blows this game away. I should have just stuck with that game and not bought this one. I always thought NFL2K was better than the EA version and I was right. I love NCAA 2003, but this game stinks. Defense is very hard to control and the playbook is weak."
5,AWESOME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Game to play on the Sony Playstation 2,"Madden NFL 2003 ( Made By: ELECTRONIC ARTS) is a AWESOME game to play on the SONY PLAYSTATION 2I give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY & PLAY this game on your Sony Playstation 2***Keep the great job up ELECTRONICS ARTS***"
2,DB,"This year's version has the same flaw as last year. The opposing QB throws at least 90%. This makes the game very one dimensional. You still end up beating the computer 65 to 17, but there is no fun when all your opponent does is pass. It is very hard to believe that the programmers could play this game and think it is realistic or fun. I regret buying this game, I should have learned my lesson from last year. Buy NFL 2k3."
3,"GOOD at first but, gets boring...","When you first start playing this game it is amazing! There are many realy cool new features. It is the best NFL football game you can get. There is mini-camps, create a team or player, and madden cards. But, once you play this game for a while and you have enjoyed all the features it gets real boring. Unless I had someone play against me I stopped playing after a couple weeks. Rent it! Borrow it! Buy it and trade it in later!"
3,"Not that bad, not so good","I went into EB with all intentions of buying the new Madden only to be bombarded by salesmen convincing me to pick 2K3 instead. Now, I'm glad I did. I like the preseason stuff and all of the madden options. The game is definitely decent, however, bottem line is that 2K3 is more fun to play. The graphics are better, its tougher to bust the big play, the ESPN features are cool. Madden 2002 is also a better game. I hope for better things in the future."
2,i have this game,this is a good game if you havn't played madden 2002. before i bought this game i was looking forward to better anouncing. not the case. al michaels is different but not better. madden still says the same genaric stuff. mini camp is fun. create a play book is a nice feature. none of this however warrents a purcase if you are looking for a new game.
5,"Yessssssss, Madden Football is Back.","I have played Madden Football way back on the Sega Genises. Before Madden there was the Joe Montana Football, which spawned Madden Football. Since 1984 EA has been getting better and better with Madden Football. At E3 2002 Madden fans got a first hand look at this New and Improved football game and Engine.The game offers better running plays. Faster reflexes to throw the pass to a reciever. Graphics have improved by far non.The honeymoon is over baby, it is time to play with the big boys. This is a must have game and also the Online Adapter is a must when it comes out. That way you can go Online and challenge friends or even some of the Pro's."
3,College is the way to go.,"Let me start off by saying EA Sports started a new football season with NCAA Football 2003. The game is fantastic and it never gets old. Then i rented Madden. This game is quite well made. I'm happy w/ everything about it but the gameplay lacks somewhat. For me the passing defence becomes difficult at pro level. I often throw at least 2 interceptions a half on 3 minute quarters. I may b using mediocre teams but it shouldn't matter on the second lowest level. Also, I find the gameplay somewhat slow and tiresome. It seems to take quite awhile for things to develop such as a play, and the speed of the quarterbacks can be annoying especially when no receivers are open and u hav yards of space ahead of u but the qb runs as fast as your pet rock Stoney. In conclusion, Madden doesn't have the excitement and pageantry, and the speed, that NCAA Football 2003 brings to you."
4,Incredible Gameplay,Incrediible Gameplay. I loved this game its unbelieavable from the grass on the field to the touchdown dances of the players. New rosters and players make this game worth buying. new game modes that pack a ton of fun into this game also make it a wonderful buy. Create-a-playbook is just awesome. Gang tackles and hard hits and blitz's are more ferocious than ever before. defense is also actually fun in this game so ur not always wishing that u had the ball in ur hands. Overall this game is unbelievable...graphics are smooth awesome sound track and incredible fun...this game is worth buying HANDS DOWN!
5,Madden...what else is there?,"Madden 2003 is definately better than any other football game created to date. Let me explain why....the realism of the tackles, the skill and knowledge of football it takes to actually beat the CPU (especially in All-Madden mode), player ratings are right on (even Vonnie Holiday is getting his props!), the various options to customize players, jerseys, teams, playbooks (you can pick various real-life coaches play books or create your own with your best plays!). You name it Madden has is over other games. This game is DEFINATELY for the football minded. If you want to just play a football game and not worry about all the specifics pick up Blitz or 2k3 but if you want basically true to life play from the tackles to receiving this is the game for you!"
4,Good....But Not Great,"Overall, I would say Madden 2003 is a slight improvement over the 2002 version. One big plus is the Instant Replay challenges...in the 2002 version the wrong part of the play was often viewed, in 2003 everyone so far has been right on.When playing the computer, running the ball is tough...you usually only get 2 to 3 yards per carry. Sacking the Quarterback is a rarity..but interceptions occur more than in 2002. The one thing I find rediculous is the computer almost always being able to connect for big yards especially on 3rd down. I like a challenge...but it has become predictable that this kinda thing will happen yet there is no way to stop it usually.Overall, I would recommend Madden 2003...but like any other video game the little things can get to you."
3,Wheres the Defense,"The added increase artificial intelligence makes your computer counterparts play better defense. But in a head to head to competition with another player it is impossible to stop someone from scoring. This version of madden is offensively orrientated, gone are the days of 14 to 7 wins. If you are defensive minded this is not the game for you stick with 2002"
3,"Not too bad, but it gets old quickly.","The initial fun of this game was good, but it quickly got boring. Maybe I've been playing too many football games lately or something. But this game lost its luster quickly. Not bad though. Its worth renting for sure. The competition is not bad either."
3,Cross-Eyed QBs?,"Why are all the QBs cross-eyed? Just goes to show that while a very good game, it is still very much flawed."
3,Looks good BUT,well i don't think it can compare to nfl2k3's game....I mean the madden graphics look amazing and so does the new mini camp...BUT i love franchise mode and i must admit that 2k3's looks betr...You have a first person view to everything...a cell phone..laptop and a whole redesigned office for YOU. Also u goota luv this espn license..imagine seing an amazing play u made..on sportscenter...and the half time and pregame report on the game...I think Madden has gotten betr and disagree wit such reviews that say it is the same old ... thing...and ea sports foot ball gas always been dominant so..Here is a list of wat is good about madden on a 1-5 scale:Gameplay:3.5 sry folks but i don't like the gameplay muchFranchise:4Graphics:5Fun Factor:3.5Replaybility:4Overall:3.5-4
2,Rent this and NFL 2k3 then decide.,"Do yourself a favor and save some time. Rent this and NFL 2k3 then go out and buy Sega's NFL 2k3. I was at the videogame store the other day and the manager said people were returning Madden and buying Sega's NFL 2k3. Sega's NFL 2k3 won the best sports game last spring at the largest videogame conference. Sega's NFL 2k3 has been critically acclaimed by many of the videogame magazines and web sites out rating Madden. They say this year's Madden is just like last years with a mini camp added while Sega's NFL 2k3 is innovative, fresh and all new."
4,**OK GAME**,"I was truly dissapointed with this game. For one thing the computer defence is unstoppable. For antoher, the gameplay is too slow and that makes running plays both difficult and boring. If you have played other football games(i.e. NFL Blitz Pro) you would find that it is much better because of the fast gameplay. And another thing, making players and teams gets old FAST. I thought two cool features were that you can make a playbook and that you can do mini camps. Despite some entertainment, this game is not worth buying. I suggest you pick your football video game out very carefully before you purchase it. Thanks for reading."
3,No more online play.,"If you wanna play a football game online,don't play this cause' its not online anymore.It was only online for one year.That is a rip-off,dontcha think?Well,Madden 2004 is online...For now...But in August 2004,that too will be offline.So if you want a online football game that won't last online for only a year,check out NFL 2K3 or ESPN NFL Football."
3,DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS,"EA Sports really had it together with Madden 2002. The onlyproblem I saw was you could not run between the tackles.With Madden 2003, it doesnt matter what defensive coverageyour're in, your opponent can still complete Deep passes,underneath passes with two and three defenders on them. This isridiculous. In Madden 2002 your opponent had to know his/her playbook and they also had to know the defensive coverages in order to win games. Go back to the defensive oriented style andyou remain #1. I.E.- NEW ENGLAND VS ST. LOUIS (Defense wins)."
4,Best football game,This is my favorite football game of all time the graphics are sweet the players almost look real and the overall gameplay was incredible. The only down side to this game was not really a down side it was after a while it started to get boring. Then I would take out the game and put in another. But this is one of the best football games it is even better when there are 2 or more people playing. You can all be on the same team and beat the computer very very badly. That was another one of the good things about this game. I would give it a 5 but it is just when playing the computer it gets kind of boring so I gave it a 4.
5,The best football game ever,"Wow what can i say about this game other than EA Sports did no wrong making this title. The game runs smother and faster now, instead of have those 1-on-1 tackles this years has gang tackles which is really cool, also the franchise mode is really challenging (for the first time ever) because of the simple fact that some players that you want like marshall faulk and others you simply cant trade for which is good because thats like it is in real life also the draft is very cool because you have to scout the players that you want and you dont know their rating until you actually draft them this is cool because any team regardless of draft position can have a good draft. The mini camp mode is pretty cool and i cant wait 'till the network adaptor comes out so we can play online o yeah and the create a playbook is very innovative also. he best football game ever period!"
4,what are you 2k3 people talking about !!!!!!!!!,"2k3 blows!!!! madden could beat the crap out of that game. Madden has alot of features that Sega wouldn't even think of. For instance, FRanchise mode( which finally appeared in the version)But don't get me wrong Madden 2003 has It's flaws. I think that online gamplay was a total waste of time and mini camp too. And I can also agree with the people that say that pass coverage is unusually hard. Every time I turn around the QB has 300 ""flippin"" yards passing. But you can't go wrong if you can score 200 points in a 8 minute quater game. Offense is the best period. Well I guess all I really have to say is that I will always like madden even if ya 2k3 sukas think it sucks!!!!!!!Peace!!"
4,A great field bag.,"I am a field researcher with a university and chose the Lowepro Nova 2 AW to transport my camera safely around the field sites. I used to bring out my Pelican case but was tired of the weight. The Nova is a great replacement for a hard case if you have two lenses, I carry my 75-300mm lens as well as battery packs and the camera itself. The bag can be cavernous if packed correctly.Certainly a worth while purchase."
4,"Nice bench, a few flaws","I gave this 4 starts but it was definitely bordering on being 3 stars. Most of the problems have to do with the installation. The instructions are just about useless. You'll figure it out by looking at a finished picture, but it's annoying. There are only two pilot holes pre-drilled, so for a quality looking build, plan on having to drill your own pilot and counter-sinking holes. Where do all the screws go? Well, the instructions only say for some of them. So, use your best judgement. I tried to put mine on the backside/underside, when possible, to hide them. It is only roughly finished, so plan on having to do some sanding and staining/sealing. If you take the time to assemble and finish it properly, it seems pretty sturdy and should hold up well. The sitting surface is nicely contoured, so it's actually very comfortable."
1,Incomplete,No instructions and no screws included with this product. Very dissapointing. Only a few holes were drilled as well.
3,Good but not enough,"I saw that this book was recommended by several sites. I bought it as I am just beginning to be interested in traditional archery. The first half is really thin on information. The second half is full of exercises which seem good. I have tried some and they seem to help as I get started.It will not provide you with information that I was looking for such as definitions. There is, as in any profession or hobby, a lot of jargon, language specific to the hobby. Not explained as well as I wanted.I thought Shooting The Stick Bow to be much more helpful."
2,NOT for Beginners,"Be warned: this is NOT a beginner's guide. By ""beginner's guide"" you would assume that the very basics of archery would be covered, however, this author leaps right in, not bothering to explain terms that no beginner would comprehend. This IS a good book, however, it is definitely for the intermediate, so do NOT purchase it if you have little or no experience in archery."
5,Learning to Shoot a Stick Bow,"This book is great for the beginner. BUT, the will also help the old pro. who thinks they already know everthing ther id to know about shooting Traditional. I do not hesitateto recommed this book to any Traditional shooter reguardless of where they are in their experience of shooting."
2,Disappointed,"Not much real information for a beginner. How to set up a bow, aiming and shooting, etc. Need more basic information for a beginner."
4,Good Book For Devoted Archers,"Like all how to books, you can't just read and be able to do something. You have to practice a lot! I found it enjoyable and it had lots of good tips. The thing is, you can just get the same tips online for free. I feel the book could have taught different and original/challenging ways to learn to shoot bows."
4,Good for beginner,"if you are gettng started its a good choice, not a lot of detail though, may want to look at other books if you are expecting a lot of detail and technical information, but it is good for the basics."
2,Good info but not enough on technique,Book contained good info about all parts of bows and arrows and how things are labeled but did not really give you a goo shooting algorithm
2,Tradiltional Archery Brian J. Sorrells,"Compared to Anthony Camera's ""Shooting the Stickbow""; As an archer that has been shooting for over fourty years i find this book not to be particularly informative and of low instrucktional value. Mongo925."
2,Just what I wanted...,I'm a new person to archery and this book was just perfect. It had photo's and detailed everything I need to learn as well as what I needed to purchase. I would recommend it to anyone who's just starting out. Very good and easy to read!
3,Good product. Maybe adding an extra strap or ratchet would be better,"THis is a decent product. The only issue i have with this is maybe the lack of a third strap (ratchet or velcro). Bottom line, pay the extra $100 for the ratchet version; that adds more stability and keeps your foot in the shoe. Almost feels like my foot is sliding out of the shoe at times when i pull up."
1,aburrida,"Compre este libro porque lei que la obra de Carlos Fuentes titulada AURA era una copia, no dudo que se haya inspirado en este libro, pero no es una copia definitivamente, el libro de AURA se va ligero, es interesante y uno quiere seguir leyendo, en este caso los Papeles de Aspern me dieron sueño, me perdi y no lo pude terminar."
5,"Helpful Company, helpful book",This book arrived in less than a week. It was in perfect condition. I would use them again.I had it in time to learn a few stories for Bug Week at school.Pleasant DeSpains stories are always wonderful.
5,A very thorough workout,"This dvd covers everything! Strength & endurance, balance, flexibility, functional fitness, core training, cardiovascular...There's not a muscle that goes uncovered. It's almost like an aerobic strength training workout. It is nonstop, fastpaced toning that gives no time for breaks. She uses dumbells, a resistance tube, a step and a mat. The first half she uses the weights, the second half she uses the tubing. There's a great glute section and core workout at the end followed by a nice stretch. I do this one weekly and recommend it to anyone looking for a thorough, challenging workout."
3,"The Depression Book, short form","This is an old version of what has been reprinted, and expanded, as The Depression Book. I do find the newer one to be worth it--it misses, for example, one of my favorite quotes ""If you cannot be kind to the one person whose suffering you can actually feel, you will never be able to be kind to anyone."" That does not make this book worthless--if you can find it and it's all you can afford, it will provide a great deal of wisdom and comfort. Huber's approach is, as always, one of kindness and self-love and just reading her words will often help.She's not a quack and is not trying to 'cure' depression, but rather inviting the reader to sit with the depression and see what's underneath. I cannot say how it can help someone who has clinical depression, but I know that I have found it immensely useful in times of need."
2,VERY BAD. REALLY VERY BAD.,"How De Niro is in the middle of this garbage ? Easy to explain: first, the paycheck, of course. He has increased his schedule of work dramatically in latter years, with tragic results mostly. Second: a good premise. The movie really has a good premise to talk about. BUT THE EXECUTION WAS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!! A waste of talent and money. A movie to be forgotten as soon as you finish watching it. Blame it on the director, the technical department, whatever. The result was catastrophic."
2,Not a fan... wast of my time.,"I'm a huge DeNiro fan, but was left feeling way disappointed. The movie seemed like a good idea playing on how the media controls the public's perspective and influences our everyday lives but really had no substance to it. 15 Minutes tries to be shocking but fails to deliver anything substancial. Robert De Niro plays a celebrity cop in New York who is teamed up with another cop Edward Burns (who's acting was disapointing). They are hot on the trail of two criminals who record their murders on a camcorder. There are some entertaining action/shoot 'em up scenes throughout and the idea is intriguing, but the movie fails to deliver. I personally can't recommend this movie."
3,A&V Excellent but Cannot Turn Off the Subtitle,Movie is ok. Audio & Video is excellent. One problem: I could not turn off the subtitle (no matter how hard I tried). It's so distracting & annoying. This is the 1st time I experienced something like this. (I have a Pioneer DV-525 which is pretty good.) I can't imagine a DVD being produced w/ this problem. Would appreciate hearing fm others if you experienced same thing.
1,"Pompous and Lousy, To Be Avoided...","Pompous movie that belittles your brain and attempts to beat you senseless making points over and over throughout an increasingly ludicrous, illogical excuse of a movie. Even Robert DeNiro fares poorly in a flat performance. These aren't characters, they just exist to further ""the message"" this movie supposedly has. Just take my advice and avoid this movie..."
1,Not even worth 15 Minutes of your time,"This movie's so-called commentary on media and fame makes about as much sense as a bar room brawl. Heavy-handed direction, trite dialogue and poor performances. Will someone please tell Ed Burns he can't act!Don't waste 15 Minutes of your life to watch this! BUYER BEWARE!"
3,WHAAAATTT????,"I did not like this movie because it simply makes no sense at all... besides you don't expect the hero of the movie disappearing by the middle of the movie and i think that was a bad move from the director... but that's only my opinion... I was very disappointed by the movie and did not expect to see de Niro accept this role... Nonetheless, he is still one of the best actors of all time by his diverse roles.If you are one of his fans, go watch the movie but don't expect a lot from it..."
3,Could have been better,"I guess I expected more from this movie. De Niro was good, but the rest of the cast left a lot to be desired. The plot was okay, and there were some good parts, but all-in-all it's a movie I wouldn't have missed not seeing."
3,THE PRICE OF FAME,"Being all the way over the other side of the world I only saw this at the movies last week. This is a good, if bloody, thriller which exploits the media as well as showing how the media can exploit others. Robert De Niro and Edward Burns are cops on the trail of a two killers (one Russian & one Czech) who enjoy videotaping the murders of thier victims and embark on a citywide spree, all continuously filming themselves and attempting to become national celebrities. To make matters worse a TV anchorman (Kelsey Grammar, in a very good performance) is trying to secure a deal to show the footage on prime time television. There is an unexpected twist midway through the film which earns the movie some bonus points,as well as making the viewer think carefully about the true price of seeking and attaining fame and notoriety as shown in the finale (which proves that the bad guys are really just a couple of egocentric dumbasses). Well worth a look"
4,Sad But True.....,"The saddest thing about this movie is that in a few years it could be, in my opinion, based on a true story:( This is a excellent movie and intense this movie will show you just where the justice system, legal system and media have gone in this country and even sadder it will also show you where we as a people will lead towards unless enough people get so sick and tired of the way things are turning. Whatch this movie it starts off a bit slow and wacky but it gets soooooo good!!"
1,Painful.....,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last 10 years. It is one of those movies that makes you genuinely sad that you've wasted time watching it. I'm actually embarassed for De Niro, as I can't quite understand why he allowed himself to be a part of this travesty.The film is full of ridiculous scenes that you possibly could ignore, if the film was otherwise intact. But TRUST ME! This is the worst the worst the worst flick De Niro has ever acted in, although he wasn't awful himself. The story line reads like a high-schooler wrote it. No regard for reality. Its not smart, its not sexy, its not hip, its not funny. It IS an awful film."
3,"great message, not-so-great performance","Films of this kind (maybe a little better) should be compulsory for high school kids. The message this film carries is extremely powerful: the impact of media on our every-day lives and motivations. Unfortunately, a lot remains to be desired to make this a great movie. Two main characters (de Niro and Burns) have failed to deliver the quality expected of their names and despite excellent performance of the two villains (Roden and Taktarov), the movie lacks the necessary ingredients. Nevertheless, it's worth seeing if for nothing else, than at least for purely educational purposes."
1,SILLY,"I found the Cz national's need to video tape everything, including his own death, silly and annoying. The plot, such as it is, did not hold my attention and I'm glad I just rented the film instead of buying it.Robert DeNiro has seen better pictures than this and I'm surprised he consented to be in this one."
4,Brilliant,"Let me start by saying this...I was skeptical of this movie when I first bought before renting. Robert DeNiro is as brilliant as ever playing a NYPD detective for homicide. He is hyped by the media in which he is almost a celebrity in what he does best is to serve and protect. The movie never lacks action and suspense, which I am a loyal fan of this genre. Before i put this movie in and started to watch, I was thinking of about taking it and resaleing back, but I have changed my mind 100%."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This One!,"You know De Niro is good in any movie no matter if it's a bad one and my God did he ever try to save this film with as usual a stellar performance but he gets killed in this one and you know De Niro isn't supposed to die in any film especially this lame one. Then you're stuck with these two dopes running around with a camera recording their crimes, well there's just one guy and this guy must be a total [jerk], you don't have any sympathy for this sort of ""innocent"" killer even though it's his partner doing the killing and this other guy is not too bright either. Rent this movie first folks. I am not critical of De Niro, he's one the best actors alive and I did by the Ronin DVD. I just couldn't find anything to love about this film."
3,"COME ON, IT'S NOT SO BAD !!!","This is not so bad. The chemistry between De Niro and Burns works perfectly. THe only weak part is the ludicrous final sequence ( the old cliche of the bad guy taking the main female character as hostage, pointing a gun at her head, was a joke ...) De Niro dying (without playing a villain) was a strong idea. All in all, a good movie to be seen at home, in video or DVD."
2,If Only 15 Minutes,"I wish this film were only 15 minutes long because then I wouldn't be writing this.This Movie Is Really BAD! First off the acting is pretty terrible the Two Russians. Oh excuse me One Czech and one Russian Either way they both suck. One dimensional,scene chewers that they are they look like Oscar winners next to Ed Burns. How does this guy continue to work? He is unwatchable. I give this film Two Stars 1 for Robert Deniro Who is lucky enough to check out earl if you know what I mean. No big Surpise, and 1 star for Kelsey Grammer who does a nice turn as sleazy talkshow host.If you have to see this movie. do it while you're cleaning you cat box or peel dead skin off of your feet or some other really exciting task you've been putting off. This way you will not completly waste two hours like I did."
1,Less Than Zero,"....I'm at a loss to say how unrelentingly bad this movie is. Acting (except DiNiro, who bails), dialog, plausiblity, pointlessness... and of course, utterly predictible from start to finish.All the stuff about fame, the media, etc has been said & done over and over and over--but this time, its for comic book readers only. Its utterly obvious and very, very dumb.I usually enjoy movies that make New York look like a dangerous dump--not a stretch, really--but this is rock bottom. Even Kelsey Grammer deserves better and Robert DiNiro should be ashamed to foist this [stuff]. I thought Magnolia was the worst movie I'd seen but this makes Magnolia seem like Citizen Kane. Avoid."
2,Pretty silly,Extreme suspension of disbelief is a must if you want to enjoy this movie. It has: * A silly premise * Ridiculous situations and character reactions * VERY good good-guys and VERY bad bad-guys * A downright cornball endingIf you're in a good mood you may enjoy it as you will be laughing most of the time...
2,"I usually love De Niro, but...","This movie was awful. De Niro is a media savy cop, who, with the help of an arson investigator (played by Ed Burns), is hunting down a couple of Eastern European criminals. The criminals decide they can get away with anything if they can appeal to the media. If the intention of this movie was to poke fun of the media, then it seemed to take itself too seriously. If it was a serious movie, it was just too over the top to be enjoyable. I kept trying to find something to enjoy, but just couldn't. If you want to watch a better movie with De Niro, try ""City by the Sea""."
2,major stars don't always make a good movie.,"i have to admit i only purchased this movie because of the stars,robert deniro,ed burns and kelsey grammer.but this movie lackes a lot to be desired.have i purchased and seen worse?you bet.it does have some qood qualities,but 120 minutes,seems like an eternity.watch it first,then buy it,only if you like it."
4,Not That Bad of a Movie,"ok, ill be the first one too agree that this movie has it's flaws. But the story line is pretty good and it is a pretty entertaining movie. It kinda starts off really slow and the media part is kinda annoying but it also makes it a bit more realistic that way. It may not be Robert De Niro's best movie but he certainly makes it entertaing. And Edward Burns adds a really good element of acting to this movie and his performance is believable. The ending is pretty cool. It's kinda stardard hostage at gun point ending but i love those."
1,the film/ de niro,"...a disappointment and major blow to the De Niro ""can do no wrong"" theory. The man is truly a legend and I still hold him in high regard but my god this film was bad.It was suppose to reflect what America's love of violence is like - a condemning look, yet it didn't achieve it. Scene after scene of pointless violence soon made it hypocritical and the script was appalling.De Niro just wasn't up to scratch, he's slumming it in this film and I resent him for it. I resent him because he is one of the few actors I choose to admire and trust his judgement of films thus forking out money to see them and then being let down by something like 15 Minutes.I haven't lost faith though, as I said I still respect him. I just think of Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Midnight Run and loads of other films and then remember why I like him.De Niro fans - don't avoid this film see it by all means. It's a harsh reminder that he isn't perfect."
1,Very Small!,"This shirt runs extremely small. I ended up giving my size large shirt to my daughter who wears XS in tops. So, beware!"
1,TINY,"Wish I'd read all the reviews before I purchased this item. Ordered my normal size, a medium, and couldn't even get the top on it was so small. I see that the product description now says that it runs small, but I don't remember seeing this when I ordered it in October. Have to send this one back, I'm afraid... Recommend you order two sizes up."
1,"Nice fabric, but TOO SMALL!!!","I should have read the other 1-star review. I ordered a large, tried it on, and barely got it off! It fit more like a small! I generally take a medium or a large shirt. Make sure you order a few sizes bigger than what you normally wear!Buyer beware!"
5,Classy simplicity,"Dress it up or wear it to bed! Very classy, incredible comfort, easy care. Love it!"
5,title for my review,"dude, they cover 'achin to be' by the replacements. billy joe's ties to the midwest are paying off. yeah."
5,Great man,"This cd is great for anyone who likes old school green day. (...) This combines billie joe's old attitude towards music with the other members own interpretations to bring a great album. IF the cd wasnt so short, it would be incredible. Anyone who likes punk should get this. Peace."
5,EXCELLENT EARLY VERDI,"This is a perfect, traditional production. All involved perform their roles to perfection. The chorus, Bruson and Dimitrova are exceptional."
5,Powerful,"I have a hard time finding all those problems other reviewers find. This is a wonderful biblical opera with awesome voices, scenery, costumes and music. I have never heard a voice as spine tingling as Dimitrova...in such a demanding role. The chorus pieces alone are worth the price of admission. This opera is so good that I will probably add the MET version to my library. By the way there is no problem if it does not quite fit history."
2,Constantly breaking,"I used to use the old version and I loved it. It never broke while flossing. This one, after flossing like 3 teeth it breaks. Why did they have to change it? It was great before. The 2 stars are for flavor and the nice texture of the floss, thats about it. I'm disappointed with this product."
