4,Very Interesting.,This was my first experience listening to BetterthanEzra. While a few of the songs lend an uneven feel to the album(by being very harsh and raucous) there are definitely some very good ones here.
3,not their best,"I don't have a lot to say about BTE's newest album. They are still one of my favorite bands, being a Louisiana native, but this album is just plain mediocre. If you really want a great BTE cd, check out Deluxe. Even though I don't have a high opinion of this album, I will continue to give it a listen and maybe I'll prove myself wrong. But until then, I'm going to pray they get away from this British pop formula and stick to the Southern rock style that I have grown to love."
4,"Weeelllll.... it's STILL, BTE!!!!","Okay, to be completely honest, I would really only give this CD three stars. BUT... I am a very devoted BTE fan and just can't bring myself to give it less than four (they get an extra star just for being BTE). This is, sadly, nothing like ""Deluxe"" or ""Friction, Baby"" and the squeaky, techno sound just isn't as appealing. ""New Kind of Low"" is one of the very, very few BTE songs I just can't sit through. BIG thumbs up to ""Alison Foley"" and ""Happy Day Ma Ma"", though. Overall, a disappointment when compared to their previous work (I just bought ""Closer"" and am glad to see they've gone back to their roots). Overall, though, this IS a Better Than Ezra CD and is, therefore, worthwhile listening. Just not as worthwhile as their other releases."
2,"A change, but not for the better","I've always been a fan of Better Than Ezra, but after listening to their third album, I found myself longing for the earlier days. ""How Does Your Garden Grow"" just ain't that good. The musical style is slightly different on this album, which would normally be a refreshing change, but with the exception of maybe 3 or 4 good songs, the songs on this album just totally stink! I was hoping for more songs like the hit single ""At The Stars"" but the rest of the songs just seemed empty and lacking in creativity. This was a real disappointment. If you really want to check out this band, get one of their earlier albums, ""Deluxe"" and ""Friction Baby""...don't waste your money on this one."
1,One More from the rip-off artists,Aside from the one original song on this album I would say this was a Bush album or maybe Dishwalla. Seriously though this would have been a good album in 1995. But now it is just another unoriginal album to go with all the others.
2,"With this album, something went wrong...","After heared from the new Better Than Ezra album I looked forward to get it, since ""Friction, Baby"" is one of my most favourite records. But then I was really disappointed about that (in comparison to the previous ones) boring record. Get ""Friction, Baby"", its a wonderful album. -Forget ""How Does Your Garden Grow"" , it sucks."
3,! Integrity !,"In short, this sounds just like Integrity.In detail, this is the ""Debut release from all-star hardcore group fronted by Dwid Hellion of Integrity and featuring members of Liar, Congress, and Death Before Disco.""Sledgehammer sounds like Integrity as much as Icepick sounds like Hatebreed. This is not necessarily a bad thing. You definitely know what you're getting and that is quality, metallic hardcore. You can't really hear any distinct sounds that would include Liar or Congress. Your Arsonist is an 88 track EP including 4 base songs averaging 3 minutes; 1 spare track at the end which is nothing more than some electronic beats; and 83 blank filler tracks lasting four seconds each (absolutely pointless).This is a pretty cool discovery if you try to collect everything Dwid does and you are a ""hardcore"" Integ fan. Apparently this disc was released independently (?) and on Martyr Records which can be found here on Amazon for an irresistible 43 cents.Martyr Records- Jay in Tx."
2,dangerously biased,"this is not biography, but libel with a good motive. For an unbiased overview of the polemic about dr. B. see the review ""The Strange Case of Dr. B."" in the New York Review of Books, Volume 50, Number 3 ? February 27, 2003. (i found it online)"
4,A Poseur Exposed,The Creation of Doctor B: A Biography of Bruno BettelheimI read Bruno Bettelheim books when he was the guru of child psychiatry in the 50's and 60's and thought they were excellent. Now this book exposes the truth about him. It is quite interesting and anyone who still believes in his methods should really read it.Jane Gaschke
5,All-around great buy,I bought 2 of these lights as area spots to mount on the opposite wall and illuminate my beautiful chimney and trusswork from across the room. The quality of the fixtures is excellent and the lights cast the perfect amount of illumination into the area. I'm thrilled with these little lights!
3,Good But Not A Great Book,I found this book to be difficult to stay with. You have to have an understanding of this type work to really relate to the problems presented to oneself by a closed system. Inasmuch he helped create the very system he is trying to get away from you have to wonder. I am sure the intelligence gained from his defection gave the US a good look inside a system which they heretofore had not had. The fact he was an Officer (Major) was certainly a big plus.
2,USA Specific Information,"For the international reader, specific information provided about what obtains in the USA may be excessive. It definitely is a good book to read for someone fresh into recruiting in the USA."
5,The best series ever,"I have to say... that I bought the robotech macross saga series a while back and it is amazing. You have to watch it. Whatever version you buy, the remastered, the original, this one... get it. It is worth spending countless hours watching. The other two are so-so. but this is good. Really good."
4,Half and Half,"This memoir is broken up into two sections -- 1) Portrait of an Invisible Man and 2) The Book of Memory. The first is organic, enticing, moving, brilliant in almost every way. The second is rather forced, somewhat muddled, and just generally not very interesting. This may be because the first section is a straightforward exposition of Auster's family history while the second is a quasi-artsy autobiography of sorts.If you read through the other reviews here, there are many who loved the whole book, so my reaction is probably in the minority, so don't be afraid to pick this up. And let me just say that I don't regret reading this book at all -- the Portrait of an Invisible Man is so damn good that it makes the entire work worthwhile."
2,"paul auster's ""the invention of solitude""",too self consciously written. auster is so self absorbed and caught up in the importance of his feelings that i lost interest. not well enough written to merit that kind of investigation.
3,Beautiful First Half,"This book's first half is gorgeously vulnerable. Auster creates his father as a fascinating character, and the reader learns about him through Auster the adult writer/man finding his father through the objects he's left behind and also through Auster's memories as a boy. What's so strange, then, is the second half of the book, which becomes overly artificed. Auster writers about himself in the third person, calling himself ""A."", and what follows is a distanced meditation on what memory might be. All of the vulnerability of the first half gives way to a nearly solipsistic second half. It's like Auster has decided to turn himself into his father and let the reader view him, but the reader is no longer allowed to sympathize with him. Truly, this second half seems a total intellectual invention of, alas, solitude, as the reader is held perpetually at arm's length. Buy a used copy and read the first half."
5,Auster at his best,I have read almost all of what Auster has published -fiction and non-fiction- and this is my favorite. A meditation on life and death: litterature at its best.
5,Diary of a Single Dad,"This non-fiction book is intriguing and helpful to not only single dads, but to families in general. This is an incredible, intense story of strength, and of a father whose love, nurturing, rage, pain, and acceptance are clearly portrayed. I was honored to recently meet Author Cary Hutchinson, and can't say enough about his writing! God bless this family for they have been through so much."
1,A good premise but bad writing,"I was intrigued to read this book recommended to me by a friend. The premise was interesting but I was disappointed with the writing. The author definitely needs an editor to catch the numerous typos and grammatical errors. Additionally, I found myself extremely bored by the author's ramblings about birthday parties, his motorcycle, and his ability to negotiate a good car deal. I understand the points he was trying to make but he took way too long to get there. I was also frustrated with the way the author glossed over the big blowup that changed everything. The author should have spent more time writing about what happened during and after his blowup instead of page after page of his everyday life leading up to it. Contrary to the book's ""Foreward"" (sic), I did not cry nor get mad, I was only annoyed."
2,mention features that does not apply for some car models,"mention features that does not apply for some car models, not easy to upgrade via web , will not recomend it"
4,Scanner,INNOVA 3120 Diagnostic Code Scanner. Found one in my home town and was 100.00 more than this one. Works well. Good price from shopping around. Very promt service.
3,Will not work on all obd1 cars,Will not work with any GEO cars and will not work with some of the brands stated on the description.works fine for OBD2 cars but in that case get a different cheeper model that only does obd2
1,is not universal,"Bought for a 93 t100, hooked it up...oh wait, couldn't hook it up, there's no cord that works. I'm sure it is a great dcs, but call the manufacturer first to be sure your vehicle is compatible."
5,Innova 3120 scanner,"Great tool, being able to read obd1 and obd2 vehicles this scanner is very versitale, a handy tool for any mechanic."
4,Equus 3120,Unit was defective as received but I found the technical support very helpful and quick at replacing the original unit. I sent it to the factory rather than returning to Amazon because I wanted this model yet Amazon could only provide credit upon my return.The new unit works as it should. The unit is fairly complex but does provide information in sufficient detail to satisfy even a professional user once the features are learned.
3,could not check OBD1 for suzuki sidekick,"Really this scanner overpriced. I could not check my Zuki 1995, but i think i need additional cable. It is perfect for OBD2"
3,didnt receive every hook for unit,my kit did not come with a cord to hook up to my computer. to download the dtc codes. i would like to have one sent to me as the unit was new and it should have every hook up especially the cord to hook up the pc to the unit thanks dennis
4,Review,I have a 93 camary and this product helped me find the problem right away. it's also easy to use.
2,Will not work on GM 1994-1995 3.8 V6 engines,"Since the GM 3.8 V6 engines were in all the Park Avenue & Olds 98 & Pontiacs between 1994-1995, you might think this scan tool would work since it says it will read some of the more popular OBDI cars prior to 1996. Those were popular cars. This scan tool will not work on them according to Innova Technical Support and some users who have tried it."
2,OK but overpriced for limited functionality,"Yes, the 3120 is easy to use to retrieve error codes but BEWARE; it does not display live operational data, it is limited to just what is recorded in the vehicle computer memory. For only that, its price is not justifiable.My mistake in missing the distinction between the 3120 and 3130 in the on-line product descriptions. My mistake in buying the more expensive 3120 instead of the much more capable and less expensive 3130."
5,Bang for the buck,"This is a class ""A"" scanner for the money. It employs all the protocolsincluding CAN. The only vehicles it won't work on that i am of aware of are1995 General Motors ""S"" & ""T"" series trucks. As an ex-aircraft mechanic I am very satisfied with this product for the price.Equus 3130 Diagnostic Code Scanner with Live, Record and Playback Data Capability for OBDII (Post-1996) Vehicles"
1,waste of money,"bought this on a orielly's loan a tool program and I'm glad I did because now I can return it. All you can do with it is read and erase codes that are set, you can do this with a 50 dollar cheapie. It does run monitors but it is no help after that. they charged me $426 for this tool and it is a total waste!! check out the actron 9580 instead"
2,Owners manual sucks,"If you are a novice and trying to understand the manual, good luck! The ""I/M monitor codes are not addressed in the glossary of terms and abbreviations at all, so you have no idea what system ""HTR"" is in when it keeps flashing indicating that it has not run diagnostic tests. Scanner does all I want it to do but the owners manual leaves a WHOLE LOT to be desired.."
2,returned,"did not work correctly on my 92 corvette. worked on on 2002 buick. would not work on 3 computers, never finished downloading. e-mailed tech support never returned e-mail"
3,Didn't work on my car...,"Product is ok, seems like it needs a few add-ons in order to be really and truly useful. I wanted it for a '97 Lincoln MK8, and it didn't have the right adapter. So returned it for a prompt refund. I would absolutely use this seller again - very prompt service."
5,Lifetime,I love this movie so much. I watch it every year. I am a big Lifetime movie fan. I had found out that they were discountinuing this movie so I went ahead and bought it and it was worth what I paid for it.
4,Nice Christmas movie....sorta.,"This movie is similiar to Family Man, only the main Character is a woman who gets hit on the head. It is a decent film that the whole family can watch together."
3,Fun and Sweet,"Movie was fun, different and sweet. Enjjoyed watching a situation where you know, deep in your heart, was the real true way to go in life."
3,NOT the Bill Forsyth film!,"This is just a warning that this DVD is not the eagerlyawaited release of Bill Forsyth's 1984 film, but a 2003TV movie."
2,I'm donating this one to the library,"I expected this one to be a lot of fun. I liked the actors, but the plot is just too contrived, and McKeon is frankly, a bit hostile and unlikeable. I think they could have done a lot more with this than they did. Better modern picks are A Boyfriend for Christmas, The Christmas Card, even The Snowglobe, which is silly but fun. Oldies but goodies like Shop Around the Corner, It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol and even all of the children's classics are fun, or just tune into whatever Lifetime or Hallmark are playing that year to find the best new ones. This year, I enjoyed watching Christmas Mail."
3,Good Christmas Movie,This movie was fun to watch. It's a nice and easy one to view while decorating for the holidays or just relaxing in your PJ's with a steaming cup of tea.
2,Hard to clean,Got this as a gift for someone. They thought it was difficult to clean. They will probably look for something else.
1,worst ever,this is a very poor design..the top cup piece only hold about half of the amount you are able to grind..which means you have to take the top off and tip the whole machine to empty the coffee out..and the safety mechanism- that black vertical piece- breaks..this is a really bad product by a good company.
4,Good for a beginner,"I ordered this after receiving a Keurig brewer for Christmas, and it is really simple to use. To measure the right amount of beans to grind for myekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-CountI use a shot glass and fill it about 90% of the way. I'm still experimenting, but I am finding that a finer grind works better. It also helps to use these.DisposaKup Filters - 100 Disposable Replacement Filters for Use DisposaKups and others - Box of 100 Filters - FREE PRIME SHIPPING"
5,great math help for many age levels,"We have lots of unifix cubes for our homeschool classroom. The regular ones, the letter ones, and several accessories and books. They are all great helps. It's very helpful to be able to show a math problem rather than explain it or draw it. The kids can hold the math problem in their hands and it helps so much."
4,Unifix cubes for teaching high school chemistry,"Unifix cubes are an affordable, safe, highly effective tool for teaching students the basics of modeling chemical reactions on the particle level. This is important, because many students do not easily grasp the connection between writing formulas and equations and the behavior of atoms in chemical reactions. Manipulating unifix cubes helps students model chemical behavior, and thus helps them both both to visualize chemical reactions and to understand the meaning of balancing equations. For more specific information about using unifix cubes in teaching chemistry, visit the Target Inquiry website at [...]."

5,Great Product,I ordered the Letra Tag Plus from Amazon because they had the best price.This gadget is great for getting organized. It was easy to load and easy to operate. I would recommend buying the Letra Tag Plus from Amazon.
1,showed so much promise....alas!,"I have been desperately trying to get organized, and when I found this gizmo from heaven at a heavenly price, naturally I jumped on it. After a few weeks of labeling frenzy, much like one of my other fellow reviewers, the tops of my labels started fading, then the middles, and soon the entire text of all my labels, poof! disapparated! Yes! I am a Harry Potter fan, but not for my labels in invisible ink. Tried all of the suggestions from the website. Cleaning, changing batteries, labels, cartridges. No luck. Still shooting blanks. Of course no way to put in new ink cartridges and it seems like the ink ran out. So waiting to hear back from customer service. Will post back, when and if I do. Really sad-that my labeling frenzy has been thwarted!!"
5,Bought this for Medical Office,"I have had this product for just about a year now and it has been very reliable. I use this product to label medical charts, so in fairness it isn't used repetitively, but it has worked for me flawlessly.I would purchase this item again."
3,"Ok, not the best",It works. it prints labels. it is easy to use. But it is a bit on the large side and somewhat heavy to hold in one hand. it weighs as much as my laptop does I feel! I primarily got it to label the monster tangle of cords associated with the entertainment center and bins in the storage area/garage but the design could be modified I think.
1,Got to be better label makers,"It's OK to use, labels are small, 1/2 inch high, but the middle part of the display screen stopped working after hardly any use at all (but we've had it for 1 year). You've got to be kidding!So it's off to buy a better one."
1,Deceptive Advertising by DYMO - tiny text on wide label,"With a tape width of 1/2"", DYMO made this printer's maximum font height 3/16"", or 37.5% of the available width of the tape. So you end up with a thin line of text in a sea of tape. I contacted tech support and they verified that this is the maximum font height.On the package label they advertise two line printing, but bear in mind that those two lines will be crammed into a 3/16"" band. Also on the label are graphic examples of the different print styles... with a much greater print height to tape width ratio, indicating that the text is 5/8ths to 3/4ths the width of the tape. NOT SO!This model is getting returned... to Kmart. I think I'll get the Brother PT2030AD sold here on Amazon. It comes with an AC adapter & has much better reviews, and for only a couple bucks more."
2,Dissapointed,"Like other reviews - I started out with great expectations and got some inital organizing done with the label maker. After not much use the the labels started coming out blank. I was using an adapter so batteries were not the issue. I thought maybe I just got a lemon, so I bought another one. No I have two doing the same thing - blank labels. Its a shame, but this product has some defect that make it not worth buying."
4,Not bad.,"I picked this up for under $20 at a local retail store about four years ago. I used it frequently and went through countless tape cartridges. You can also get yellow and red tape. It doesn't have a QWERTY keypad and that does take some getting used to, also switching between caps and lowercase is a bit cumbersome, but it did the job. Yes, sometimes the label tape comes out of its track and it does consume batteries, but mine lasted for four years until just now, when it stopped feeding tape, it won't print and just says ""paper jam"" before it feeds tape. I've tried a few different cartridges.I can't complain for four years of trouble-free service for under $20. It sounds like Dymo is pretty good at responding to customer questions, so I'll see what they can do."
1,Why bother?,"I purchased this to identify my stuff, especially expensive items that I loan out or let the kids use.It's not hard to use, and the cartridge system seems to be well thought out, along with the cutter and so on.BUT, the print is gray and grainy, and looks very faded.Even then I could deal with it - except for its fatal flaw: the labels simply do not stick worth a damn.I have used these on a video camera, tripod, electric cord, ipod plug, portable radio, and iPhone. Virtually all the labels have fallen off after extremely moderate use. The stickiness on the back makes these completely worthless.Further, the so-called ""metal"" tape is just gray plastic tape.I don't expect much for the the $40 or so, but labels that actually stick would be a minimum. I intend to get a Brother label maker, if they're still sold, as THAT one sticks better."
2,Disappointing,"I had also bought this label maker with great promise as it has a number of features the more basic model I had did not. However, I quickly found it jammed when printing, and thus you had to reprint, eating up the tape quicker, which is not cheap. Also, I recall it requires a lot of batteries, which seem to be exhausted quickly, compared to other things I have that use far fewer batteries, like digital cameras. So, it became an expensive item to maintain (printing tape and batteries), which i got tired of doing. So I soon replaced it with a Brother, which has neither problem."
1,"Shooting Blanks, Even after troubleshooting","Bought this label maker at Walgreens because of it's price, features, and portability. This was mainly a purchase to implement GTD with David Allen's system, and many of the people on his website use this one since it allows for an AC adapter. Long story short, DON'T buy this label maker, there are serious defects and problems with it. I've changed batteries, hooked up to 3 different AC adapters, changed cartridges, and still, blank labels. This just can not be a coincidence that so many people are writing about the same issues with not one shred of firm reaction from DYMO. Too much time already wasted and DYMO has lost a customer for life (by the way, their Cardscan product also cost me days in weeding out duplicates from my Outlook database, so I'd pass on that product too)."
3,Just smack it,I was experiencing the same issues with the ink seeming to run out. I smacked it on the desk a couple times in desperation and it fixed itself. Give that a try.
4,How to fix the 'ink' problem,"I also had the 'ink' fading problem....after having ignored several battery warnings. So I found this answer:DymoKingRank: WizRating: 93%, 66 VotesDymo LetraTAGs are thermal printers, so they don't use ink - just batteries and LetraTAG tapes.When the print starts to fade it's time to put new batteries in. When the batteries are running out the text fades first even when the motor is still feeding tape.Hope it helps!"
4,Worth it,I love this product. More than me my husband loves it. I got this to label the bottles for my son everyday at daycare. It was pain to write his name everyday on a new label. Since I got the label maker we don't have to write the name everyday. I can even put the bottles in the dishwasher and the label does not come off. So its fun and saves lot of time. I have used this for labeling some files as well. Its just worth it.
2,Labels fade with time,"My main complaint about this label maker is that the labels fade over time. I've seen other people say that theirs actually printed faded labels to start with. Mine did not, but the labels that looked good when I printed them are barely legible after a few months. Disappointing!Eventually the printer stopped working altogether. It displays ""tape jam"" when you want to print even though everything is perfectly clean inside. Good riddance! I'm going to look for a better product."
1,Labels dont even stick to THEMSELVES!,"The Labels dont even stick to THEMSELVES! I dont suppose I'll ever get to experience the ""faded label"" problem other reviews complain about.Everything else seems pretty good though. Nice concept, failed in execution."
4,Dymo LetraTag Plus LT-100H Personal Label Maker,"Dymo LetraTag Plus LT-100H Personal Label Maker (Office Product)I have been desperately trying to get organized, and when I found this gizmo from heaven at a heavenly price, naturally I jumped on it. After a few weeks of labeling frenzy, much like one of my other fellow reviewers, the tops of my labels started fading, then the middles, and soon the entire text of all my labels, poof! disapparated!

Of course no way to put in new ink cartridges and it seems like the ink ran out. So waiting to hear back from customer service. Will post back, when and if I do. Really sad-that my labeling frenzy has been thwarted!!"
2,Not great if UV light present,The label maker is a fine device but the labels can not withstand exposure to sunlight. They will brown and fade in less than a week. Not all label needs are confined to the insides of cabinets and file folders so I'm rating this quite low for that limitation.
3,Not what I expected!,"I just purchased this label maker today. Very easy to use. Font size is very dissapointing. Even at the extra large setting, it only widens the font, doesn't do anything to the height. I CAN'T GET THE ADHESIVE BACKING OFF!!! Is there some trick to this????"
1,Fresh orange peel - NOT!!!,"I have been ordering from amazon for several years and this is the first time I am upset about a return - I feel that I have received an inferior product which I agreed to return however due to the circumstances regarding this return I feel that I should NOT have to pay shipping charges for a product that has an infestation of bugsORANGE PEEL FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasonings"
1,Orange peel,I could not have been more disappointed. Item being shown in advertisements is false. I ordered two containers and each bottle was less then 1/2 full. Picture shows a full bottle. Price outrageous for what I received. Product did arrive in a timely manner. That is the only positive comment that can be made.-
1,WARNING! Dead insect in package,"Please look at the photo I added. I bought this from Amazon a few months ago (August 05, 2012), then my needs changed and I did not use it right away. I pulled it off the shelf tonight and I saw to my horror that there was a dead moth and some other larger clump of spice. There also appears to be some type of sticky fiber near the top which may or may not be the remains of a spiders web. I posted a photo here. The clump is hard to get a picture of. The moth ""floated"" to the top, possibly because ti is completely dried.Apparently, this how Marshalls Creek Spices decides to add protean to their spices. Personally, I would rather do without.Under no circumstances will I buy ANYTHING produced by Marshalls Creek Spices of Oceanside NY.Since it has been so long, I probably will not be able to return this. However, I will keep it as a reminder that this manufacturer CANNOT BE TRUSTED!!!"
3,NO PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT - BUT...,"IT WAS JUST PLAIN DUMB TO PASTE THEIR UPC SCANNING STRIP RIGHT OVER THE LABEL AND COMPLETELY COVER THE NAME ""ORANGE PEEL""; LOOKS UGLY WHEN LINED UP WITH MY OTHER SPICES."
5,AMAZING CD!!!!!!! YOU MUST HEAR IT,THIS IS AN AMAZING CD!!! IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR YEARS BECAUSE 3 YEARS AGO THIS CD WAS STOLEN FROM ME AND I REALLY LIKED IT A LOT. I RECOMEND THIS CD TO ALL THE SALSA LOVERS OUT THERE!!!!
4,Best Pictorial History of the Great Northern,"This is by far the best pictorial history of the Great Northern Railroad. Contains some excellent short ( 2-3 page ) introductions to each section of the railroad's history, but most of the book is simply very excellent photos of the subject era with highly informative, sometimes nostalgic captions. A must for modellers of the railroad"
1,Big Mistake/Disappointment,"I am not the world's greatest computer geek by a long shot, but I do pretty well at work with HPs, Dells, etc. I have these at work and at home, and have had for years. When they arrived, there were directions, which were easy to follow, and numbers to call if there were problems.Finally, I was in a position to purchase an upscale wireless computer. After much research, excitement and debate, I chose this one. It arrived several days ago when I was gone, and now, when I try to set it up, it is a DISASTER. There are no logical and cogent directions, just a couple of little mundane booklets; these are not easily understood or followed; there is nothing in the table of contents which is relevent to me: eg.""charging battery."" I could go on for pages.I would give this back in a minute. BUT, I will find someone to help me, and maybe this thing will work."
2,"Cute Kid, But...","When I saw him, I thought...""another Aaron Carter!"" His songs have catchy tunes but many of them sound the same, and the lyrics are your average bubblegum pop. I give him credit for all hes done, but his voice definitely isnt anything phenomenal. Like another reviewer said, if you want something incredible, try Billy Gilman."
1,No...,Don't you hate it when people use computers for their voices? I do I am tired of these boy band kids who cannot sing! Why do people by into it? I truly do not know. What has happened to music these days? If we keep buying into these people music as we know it will be gone. I agree with one person who wrote on here. She was describing that what is past stevie's looks? Nothing. So lets give him nothing! Please people believe me.
2,"Okay, I guess","Okay Not tryin' to be a hater but one of the only reasons I got this cd is because he is so Hot!!!! I only like one song from the whole cd and it's called ""all for love."""
5,Stevie Brock Rocks!,"I was so surprised when I heard this cd. I heard 'All for love' on the radio. I thought ok one-hit-wonder. Not so! I enjoyed every song and, to be honest with you I liked 'I found you' better than any of them."
5,All For Love,"I think this is the man for me>his birthday is 9 days after mine that is a match and I will buy this for my cousin's, sister's,and friend's.I love you Stevie Brocks and people buy it its great."
3,Not to bad,"I think Stevie is a ok singer. He's deff. what I'd think of as a ""Aaron Carter wanna-be"", but in a good sense I guess. I only like 3 of the 8 songs- ""Shut Me Down"", ""Never Wanna Give You Up"", and ""I Found You"". All the other songs are either to bubblegum-pop, or just retarted. I wouldn't reccomend his CD unless you have some extra $ to spend."
5,"Hot, fresh and full of life","Stevie is definetly one of the hottest new teen stars out there, and his cd proves it. From the upbeat songs ""if you be my baby"" and ""shut me down"" to the slow and melodic songs of ""you're my inspiration"" he showcases his voice in all ranges, and proves he can sing. He even does a remake of ""girl you know it's true"" that puts milli vanilli even more to shame! Nicknamed a ""Mini-aaron carter by many, he proves to be just as good as Aaron, and he definetly has the talent to make it as big as his idol, Justin Timberlake. I definetly recommend this cd for anyone."
3,He is such a cutie!,Stevie Brock's cd is pretty good. I think he is the cutest thing! He reminds me so much of Aaron Carter. Like his music is just like Aaron's was when he was younger. I think Stevie will be great in a couple of years when his voice changes and he gets alittle older. I can't wait to see him next week! A good friend of mine is a good friend of Stevie so we are all meetin up next week so that I cant wait for!
3,Bubblegummy - Kids Will Enjoy It,"After being hyped on Radio Disney for several months, Stevie Brock's debut album hit the stores on June 10, 2003 and I had the opportunity to listen to it already.Many people have remarked that Stevie is an Aaron Carter ""clone"" and all of the tracks closely resemble early AC songs in that they are all electronic music and bubblegum lyrics. While kids under 10 may enjoy it, Aaron fans will be severely disappointed. This album is almost too cutesy and we can only hope that Stevie and his management company will opt for REAL musicians instead of a synth, and ""grow up"" his presentation into more mainstream ballads on his next album.Worth a listen."
2,Amazing!,"Stevie Brock is awsome! When I first heard one of his songs, shut me down, I was like ""wow!"" I couldn't believe a 13 year old was that good at singing! He has a really good voice.And he reminds me of Aaron Carter.Really cute!"
5,UMMMM...OK.....GREAT CD!,"My name is Erika. I have been a Stevie Brock fan since the beginning of his career. I think he has grown up alot and its great to see that. Anyway, back to my point. Stevie is one of those people who dont care what people say about him. He keeps his head up high and follows his dreams until they come true. I am only writing this review because of what 'A Music Fan' wrote on July 17, 2004. I think it is very dis-respectful to say something that rude. You might want to reserch before you speak because when Stevie was recording his CD, his voice was changing. All boy's voices change. Well every body who needs advice before they buy the CD, this is my favorite CD. I have 3 or 4 copies because I need one for every stereo! Thanks a bunch! BROCK ON!"
1,why,"Why would anyone listen to this? It has no musical value at all other than to give preteen girls a parascope to [the condition of having sex]. Stop it while there is ""real"" music left!"
3,Coin Sorter,"This product was in good condition upon delivery, however it was pricey.It works great although it is noisey."
1,junk,"it looks very nice! but it jams up,pennys drop into quarter slots,dimes go into nickel slots,pennys always jamming up.i messed with this machine for a couple hrs...even went slow and everytime it would jam up or drop change in wrong slots! I can do it faster by hand. i am returning it as its junk."
4,Practical and pretty,I got this for my mom for Christmas. I thought it would look good in her office. She likes it. It works well.
2,Power of persuasion,"Max, our narrator, is Carlos' dog. Carlos is a little kid, about 4 or 5 years old, who is used to getting his own way and getting his indulgent parents to do most things for him, like pick up his toys or clean his room. One day he even wants to mother to dress him. Max and mom point out that Carlos will have more time to play outside if he dresses himself instead of wasting time by throwing a tantrum. Max goes on to point out that tasks you don't want to do are easier if you just do them instead of complaining about them. If you're trying to tame a child through persuasion and reason instead of discipline, this book may prove a welcome resource. It has about 425 words."
1,not helpful,"I bought this book to read to my children, ages 6 and 3. I assumed that it would be written on a child's level because it is illustrated and sold as a child's book. My children lost interest by the middle of the book. I lost interest. This book was preachy, not charming. It seems written more to the adult who is reading it then to the child it should be reaching. I have not liked any of the books in the series."
2,Not what I expected,"I did not buy this at Amazon, but it's the same video set shown here. This was not what I expected and I am disappointed in it. I'll admit I'm a rank newbie when it comes to Yoga, but this video doesn't seem like Yoga at all to me. It's more like calisthenics. From the description, I expected it to be a beginner level instructional video on the foundations of yoga. The instructor says at the beginning that it is something called ""Key Yoga"" (no idea if I spelled that right) which is ""dynamic."" What she means is, it's really more like calisthenics.In the first two minutes, she basically has you doing crunches. That is not Yoga, as far as I'm concerned. Other than one quick stretch while standing at the beginning, it's all quick moving, calisthenic style exercises.These videos are recordings of episodes from Yoga TV.Not impressed. Have ordered some new videos that will hopefully be better."
4,traditional Country music: Stories the Crow Told Me,"Interesting and often pleasant , even for people that are not fans of this type of music.Took a long time (near 3 weeks) to ship to France.CD + shipment quite expensive, but couldn't find it anywhere else."
3,Great mouse...for awhile,"I liked this mouse so much I bought it twice, but twice it did the same thing. The rubber grips on the top and side of the mouse start to peel off after awhile. You can pop them back in or try to glue them and it just pops out again the next day. Although I really liked its size and shape, I had to move on to a Logitech which I've had over a year now with no issues."
2,Get somthing else....,I won't recommend this mouse. Get something else...Pros:Nice sizeNice rubber gripGood distancePlug and play in XPCons:Ate 3 pairs of alkaline AA in 5 monthsNever felt right in my handsDied after 5 months of continuous use
2,Falling apart in less than four months,"I love this mouse because it's accurate, never lags, and is the right size for my hand. However, in less than four months the black rubber where my index finger goes started coming apart from the rest of the mouse, and now there is a ""bubble"" underneath my index finger. I'll soon be looking for a new mouse with a top skin of hard plastic."
5,What happened to Voltaire???,This is an excellent book describing in a brief way (but complete) the bios and phylosophical ideas of the greatest thinkers. But only one thing: where is Voltaire??? The author forgot to include one of the best thinkers of all times.
4,As Advertised,"The THX Ultra 800 component cable from Monster does what it's supposed to do. The cables are well built and feel sturdy in your hand. They aren't the most flexible cables I've come across, which could be a detriment when try to fit in tight spaces. The connection to the TV and back of my DVD player was secure, actually too secure. Trying to disconnect this cable is quite a chore, especially when you don't have full access to the rear of your components. As far as performance goes, I noticed slightly better images on my TV(nothing spectacular). For the price it is a good product."
3,CD is great - but service was not very good,"case was busted - was told there was only a crack in the case - WRONG! The hinges were all busted and the wheel that holds the cd was all busted so the CD was just floating around in it!! Guess I can't complain a lot for getting it for a penny, now I can see why. Took ages for it to get here too. I have ordered a lot of CD's and DVD's and it has never taken 12 days after I am told it was shipped.... I got it all within 7 days if not sooner. Not happy with the end results with this."
5,Very powerful CD for my wife and I,"In may of 1989 I met my wife and throughout june of '89 we listened to this CD over and over as we talked and got to know one another.We played ""Watermark"" at our wedding ceremony in 1993 and the whole cd was background music during the dinner.We pull out this cd a couple of time a year and each and every time I hear it I have tears come to my eyes because of how special the memories are that come to mind.Most people know ""Orinoco Flow"" but its the beauty of ""On your shore"" and ""Cursum Perficio"" that are truly moving. I recommend the entire CD for those romantic nights. You won't be disappointed."
4,Almost Perfect,"When this album was released, and Enya was virtually unknown in the U.S. it would be difficult to guess that she would become the phenomenon she did (just on the strength of this surprising, startling album). Yes, most people first heard ""Orinoco Flow"" and most (including me) have tired of it. At the time, though, it was something new and very refreshing. A very peaceful, ethereal voice. Enya has been classified in later times as a New Age artist, but her music and experience certainly belie this label. She is remarkably talented, having spent many years performing with her sister Maire's band, Clannad.This album is never tired, never dated, and one can lose oneself in its waves. Particularly soothing tracks are ""On Your Shore"", ""Miss Clare Remembers"", ""Evening Falls"" and ""Na Laetha Geal M'Óige"" (which is my favourite song here and is sung in Irish)."
4,Repetitive rhythms that take you away,"New Age music is hard to define for those who have not heard it. But if you had to name landmark albums in the growth of New Age music, this would probably be one of them. Released in the late 80's, this is probably one of the most popular New Age albums, especially by a female artist. The musical pieces are a collection of both instrumental pieces and songs, all of which remind one of nature scenes. Many of the pieces sound similar, and listening to this CD will give you a good feel of Enya's vocal range and talent. But all the pieces are good, and some are downright great; especially the famous Orinoco Flow. Overall, a good buy for relaxing music."
5,El lanzamiento mundial de Enya,"Este fue el primer disco realmente conocido de Enya (aunque en realidad es el segundo que produjo, ya que el primero se llamó simplemente ""Enya"", ahora re-editado como ""the celts""), sobre todo su canción ""Orinoco flow"", la cual estuvo en primeros lugares de preferencia por un tiempo considerable. No exagero al decir que este disco fue la puerta de entrada no solo de Enya al reconocimiento público, sino también de este tipo particular de música, lo que permitió al público en general enterarse de la existencia de artistas de la talla de Loreena McKennit o Carolina Lavelle. Si compra este disco, no deje de escuchar cuidadosamente además de la ya mencionada ""Orinoco flow"" las melodías de ""storms in Africa"", ""watermark"" y ""the long ships"", aunque realmente todo el disco resulta sensacional."
5,Sweet otherworldly music,"I must observe that this review is a review of Enya's music on a whole.Simply,her music is remarkeable.I feel that I can hardly move whenever I am listening to her heavenly vocals and rich instrumentation.I am but a dream wandering on the tameless winds as I listen to the music,allowing it to swell inside me,boundless tides of never ending fantasy and magic.I am transported,melted,almost to tears,simultaneously sorrowing and rejoicing for forgotten and new dreams.One of my favourite songs bear the words:""Summer when the day is over,there's a heart a little colder.Someone said goodbye,but you dont know why.Is there a reason why a broken heart begins to cry?""Also the piece Exile on Watermark is truly celtic as it is powerful."
5,It's Enya. Need I say more?,"This was the first of Enya's CD's that I purchased(which only makes sense because it is the first of her albums). Along with the great songs on the CD, I love Enya because all voices, instrumentation, and music are done by her. This shows real talent in a single person."
3,Hmmm...Hard to decide how many starts to give it...,"I think I would really like her music if I could understand her! Her voice is so soft which makes it difficult, if not impossible to undrestand the words!Since I abolutely love, New Agish, Celtic music sung by womyn, I would probably love her music if I could only understand the words!"
1,Disappointed,The CD I ordered was never received and the vendor will not acknowledge my request for a replacement/refund.
1,I 2nd the Motion: Like Listening to a Migraine Headache,"God-awful, repititive boring stuff. Just say ""NO.&quot"
1,"I wish I had bought ""a day without rain""",This cd only has two songs that are worth listening to. Some of the songs on this were just instrumental songs with no vocals. I'm going to put my cd in a yard sale.
5,WOW!!!!!!!,"This was the first Enya CD that I listened to, and I loved it! Enya is a wonderful artist and she expresses a lot with her music. ""Storms in Africa"" was one of the best songs on ""Watermark,"" but they were all great!"
4,Dazzling and Spiritual,"This is an excellent album with a great variety of beautiful and spiritual songs. Enya is the best New Age artist out there! I would of given it five stars, but considering her music now (which is AMAZING), this album isn't quite as good, which is fine! My personal favorites from this album are Cursum Perficio, Storms in Africa, and Orinoco Flow. This is quite an impressive array of music, and to think that this was only her second one! WOW! That shows talent! Make sure to check out her newest CD, 'A Day Without Rain', it's beautiful."
5,Watermark,An outstaning set of songs. I listen to this CD almost daily and find it soothing and enjoyable. I especially like the first instrumental song.
4,"High ""Watermark""","Those who dismiss new age music as ""wimpy"" ought to give Enya a listen. Time and again she has proven that new age artists can be teriffic songwriters and even produce music with a little backbone. Featuring the by now fairly well known single ""Orinoco Flow,"" ""Watermark"" is this Celtic siren's best album. Warm vocals (in both English and Gaelic), lush orchestration and gorgeous soundscapes have been an Enya trademark. On her best songs, you scarcely notice WHICH language she is singing, instead the beauty of the music simpley envelops you. Though there isn't another song with a chorus as memorable as ""sail away,"" from ""Orinoco Flow,"" there is also not a clinker in the mix. Basically, Enya achieves the sound that the far more rock oriented band Cocateu Twins seemed to aspire to on albums like ""Heaven or Las Vegas.""Overall, a classic New Age album that makes an excellent starting point for those unfamiliar with the music of Enya."
4,"It's not her best one, but boy is it good...","I think, I'm pretty sure this is her first one ever, and it's not her best one that I've heard so far, but boy is it good! It's beautiful, just like the rest of her stuff that I've heard, My favorite song on the cd is, ""Sail Away."" The truth is, it always has been,..."
5,"""I am home, feeling so far away...""","That is the feeling one gets when listening to this amazing sonic journey. Enya's music, perhaps better than any of her New Age peers, has a timeless beauty that really can sweep you away. This album is far and away her best and one of the few classic albums of the genre. The album flows beautifully. The piano tracks (Watermark and Miss Clare Remembers) are washed over in synth ambience, creating deep feelings of nostalgia, Exile has a dark, isolated sound, matching Enya's lyrics aching of loneliness perfectly, and Orinoco Flow just soars. But the best is the driving edge of Cursum Perficio, a black song that Enya has yet to replicate.Forget her subsequent releases; they simply reuse the same themes and sounds established here, and to diminished effect. This is the real deal, and is just as magical as everyone says."
5,Simply Spectacular,"I remember back in the late 80's when my friend came up to my home in Central Florida. First Watermark and then Cursum Perficio played on her car's CD player. It was like a crack cuz after just those two hits of Enya, I was hopelessly addicted. Since then I have purchased every Enya CD. Each is special but Watermark is #1. It is simply spectacular.***Et itur ad astra***"
1,BOOTLEG CD,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A BOOTLEG CD AND SHOULD NOT BE ON SALE. MOTOWN/UNIVERSAL MUSIC HAVE NEVER ISSUED THESE 2 RARE EARTH RECORDS ON CD.SO PLEASE BE WARNED IF YOU PURCHASE THIS.AMAZON ARE AWARE THAT THIS IS A BOOTLEG, BUT FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THEY STILL LIST IT. CRAZY!"
3,Inexpensive???,"I haven't yet read the book (I just ordered it), but it's worth noting that, contrary to the description, $23 for a 300-page paperback book on writing is NOT ""inexpensive"" ... There are numerous competing books that cost less."
3,Nothing to Crow about,A lot of music for the money but nothing to crow about. If you know Atomic Rooster then you know Death Walks and In Hearing are their best. If your new to their music get those cds first. This is good for the fans to get some later stuff and live takes. Atomic Rooster gave us Carl Palmer and the wonderful Vincent Crane on keyboards. Very cool progressive music from the 70's. Enjoy.
1,Requires so many extra parts,Should tell you that you need to buy 2-3 more parts in order to use this...
1,Did not get to try it,I would have loved to try this product. UPS left the box outside and the dog got it...so I never got to try it.He must have liked it because its the only product he chewed up.
3,average quality,"I would expect Adidas to make something a bit more sturdy but these fell apart for my kids pretty quickly, comparable to stuff you can find at Walmart and Target. The fit was good."
5,"High quality, comfy and nice looking shoes","My kids love them. And the shoes look like they may actually last a few months :) The shoes do not fit small or large, but as you would expect given the sizing charts."
1,Research?,Recent eye movement research by Dr. Eric Paulson refutes most of the finding in this text.
2,"slow delivery, broken and dirty book!",The seller sold me a broken and dirty book which was claimed as a new one through a very slow shipping method.
3,Good starting point,"Here we have a simple, clearly written, well illustrated book of rather dull and in some cases downright ugly dolls.I don't agree with the previous reviewer who thought that the ethnic dolls were not very nice - I think the author is an equal opportunity insulter - black, white, old, young, male, female, each has its poster child for an ugly doll in this book! In fact the black doll shown on the front cover is one of the the nicer dolls I think.What I find this book useful for is the basic patterns, which I think you should then take away and be more creative with. But of course, if you really like traditional rag dolls, then these are for you."
2,Very poor directions,"The dolls are sweet and fun, but the directions were sketchy at best and scattered throughout the book for any one doll. Very poor layout also. The photographs were excellent."
1,very disappointed,I was very dissappointed when I received this book. From the other reviews I thought this was a quality book with multicultural dolls in it. If I were African American I would very affended by the AA dolls the author has included in this book. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for realistic doll or multicultural dolls.
1,The kindle edition is not the book by Chloe Green (the Dallas O'Connor mystery series),This Kindle product is incorrect. Don't buy this title looking for the book by Chloe Green because you are getting something completely different by a Robert Grossbach instead.
1,Amazon sent me the wrong product,"I recently ordered Blistex Mint from Amazon. They sent me 24 Blistex Medicated in a sealed container labeled Blistex mint. Of course I opened it as it appeared to be the item that i had ordered. The wrong porduct was in the ""right"" box. I sent it back as I did not want this kind of Blistex. Amazon now refuses to reimburse me even though they sent me the wrong product."
5,Illustrated Olive Farm,"This is a wonderful Memoir of Carol Drinkwater and her husband and how they renovated their abandoned Olive Farm in Southern France. It is so very well written, and the illustrations and photo's in the book are excellent, I loved the book from beginning to the end, and I felt transported into their amazing adventure of renovations to the Olive Farm.Truly it is a beautiful book."
1,Balderdash!,"This book is all about getting all you want out of life through your faith. It is written by a man who wanted a little more than most and when faith was not enough, flight had to do (as in fleeing prosecution for a growing laundry list of civil & criminal charges). This man is no prophet. His tone condescends even from the written pages of this book from his lofty immaginary place. A simple Google search will tell you more about him than just one reviewer. I have read this book (and others), listened to years of his manipulative messages, and watched him ruin many families and individuals. He needs help."
5,Love Qigong for Beginners DVD,"It's clear, well produced and short. Wish there were more... especially as back up to Suzanne's Heal Yourself with Qigong book."
5,"Outstanding, easy to red","It's a real shame this is out of print. This is a must read for anyone interested or involved in missions. It is extremely well written and based on sound biblical principals and data. McQuilkin is a gifted communicator who really will challenge the reader. It is a short book, filled with great information."
2,All history!,The books main focus is the history of armor. If you are looking for a guide on how to make armor this is not the resource you want.
3,Good Resource on Armour,"I don't mind the fact that this book is a little dated. I enjoyed the descriptions and illustrations and learned a few things that I hadn't known already. Although ffoulkes is a little biased about the types of armour he prefers, he none the less presents information and construction elements that apply to all harnesses. There are references in french that aren't translated, and several erroneous footnotes that are untraceable and confusing. Besides it's downfalls, there are excellent points to the book: easy to read, easy to follow, and full of tidbits you'll be pleased to rediscover when you pick it up for a second or third time. It is definately worth the inexpensive price, and should be on the reference shelf of armour enthusiasts."
3,"Wonderful magazine, abhorrent delivery service","I agree with the positive reviews of the magazine- it is a delight to read and for those of us in antiques and appraisals a great way to see what is going on over in Britain.The company that handles delivery in the US is lackluster. I had to inquire about the status of my subscription after 3 months of waiting. The magazine showed up 2 weeks into the current month and every month has gotten later. I received my December issue on the 29th. I am extremely disappointed.If this is the same company that handles the amazon order, I would recommend shopping at Barnes and noble for a copy. I ordered my subscription directly from the Homes and Antiques website."
5,Excellent study of largely misunderstood trial,"Maga does an excellent job of weeding through post-war propaganda and revisionist history to reveal a trial which was much more fair and effective than most scholars have argued. Maga carefully documents the Japanese attempts to turn world opinion against the trials and, through various machinations, detract from the criminal acts of those on trial. He also reveals the degree to which American politics, now focused on the Soviet threat and anxious to shore up Japanese support against Communism,, influenced the trial and brought about lenient sentences for war criminals, and in some cases (Emperor Hirohito, especially), no trial or punishment at all. An excellent read!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I don't know if the 4 previous reviewers are friends of Julie Rubio's or what, but I purchased this DVD due to these glowing recommendations, and can honestly say it was a waste of money. The instructor has an annoying accent, and her directions are a bit confusing, especially when she's doing something different from what she is saying. Also, I've done this DVD 4 times, and each time my back was killing me all night into the next day, and I am no stranger to yoga. Don't waste your money!"
3,Not bad,"But could have been better. I haven't done this for ages, which is a sign that something isn't that much to my taste. I found the order of the asanas a little strange, and remember thinking that she went into camel a little too soon for my liking. It's a very pretty dvd, with a lovely setting, but the cueing was slightly off, something that irritates me greatly, especially when one knows that editing is easy!"
3,"Easily removed, and not in a good way","I bought two of these in preparation for my daughter's imminent crawling adventures. The build quality of the product was good, felt very sturdy. However, when I installed them, they were easily pulled off. The locking mechanism is too wide to fit securely behind the knob as shown in the product photo. They were installed properly and as tight as they could go, but to no avail. These won't work on my cabinets. I gave it three stars because it might work for you, and it's well made. Just be sure you have more than two inches or so between your knobs and cabinet doors or it won't work as intended."
1,"not helpful, at all...","We bought these for our very standard kitchen cabinets, and they do not work. You can not get them tight enough to stay put with a child pulling on them. They slip right off with very little effort. My son just turned 18 months, and he learned how to slip these off right after he turned 1. Having knobs instead of handle is a nightmare!"
1,Don't order this - you can get a 2-pack for cents more!,"Hopefully you will read this review and not make the same error I just made...I saw the same locks, offered by the same retailer for ~$.37 less - and I ordered it. I didn't connect that I was getting a 1 pack instead of a 2 pack! Now, I would need to pay to ship this back to BHD USA if I want to rectify the situation - something that clearly doesn't make sense.Get the 2 pack from one of the other vendors for essentially the same price - and learn from my ways."
3,"Item wasn't exactly as pictured, but it still works well","This item is fairly easy to slide on and off the cabinet handles, but the way it is pictured is different from what I actually received. The one I got has a piece that prevents it from totally sliding off the handles of the cabinet, but I would prefer it didn't have that feature. It gets in the way I think."
1,some really bad music,"a collection of mind numbingly bad music- maybe this stuff would appeal to music collectors or specialists but for the average listener such as myself it is the worse CD I own. There is a variety of music but most of it is repetitive and boring, like some bad recordings anthropology classes get to hear. Don't buy this if you are looking for something like the Rough Guides or Putumayo collections of international music."
4,Like the curate's egg: good in parts,"An uneven book. Some of the explanations are clear and the long applications can be quite interesting and useful. However, several times the authors do not give an explanation that would be intuitively easier to understand. It would also have been helpful to provide some simpler, even if artificial, examples in addition to the longer applications.These can no doubt be fixed in a second edition. At present, the revised edition of Wooldridge or even the older Jack Johnston is more intuitively appealing, while Greene is more complete."
1,"Terrible book, no examples, way too complicated",The Gujarati book is MUCH better. I re-read the chapters and still have no idea whats going on. DONT buy this book.
2,hard to understand,the authors are all around when they write this book. hard to understand explanations and few examples. i would recoment my professor another book but we started with this one. :(
5,Time heals all wounds,"[I haven't read the book in some time and don't have a copy at hand, so I may misremember some things.]Time is the great divider of men in the city. Those that can see a future and plan for it are on the opposite end of the social spectrum than those that live merely for the action of the present. Banfield does a superb job of showing that this time distinction is something that is impervious to race or color. One of the great insights is that the classes of a city are not fixed in their positions: they tend to migrate from lower to upper over time.I read his chapter on ""Rioting Mainly for Fun and Profit"" just before the Rodney King riots in LA. It was oddly prophetic."
5,A real adventure,Another great read from Chloe. As the story unfolds you share the the thoughts and feelings of Greta on her wonderful adventure. It made me wonder if we all need some kind of grooming and training before we reach adulthood. A good book and one I will enjoy to read again.
1,Horrible!!!,"I read constantly and am no stranger to very edgy erotica but this book was just ridiculous. This is only the second review I've written but I was so mislead by the other reviews that I thought I should write. Greta has no problem following a strange dirty man into a filthy attic to please him with her mouth but balks at construction workers catcalling wondering if they thought that would get them anywhere with women. Well, it only took Dirty Bill telling her to follow him for her to do so. I understand submissives wanting to please a dominant but that's not what was going on in this book. There were hot scenes but most of it was just stupid."
3,foggy goggles,"Yipee, they fog. Maybe I sweat too much, I don't know. No one else had foggy goggles and lab policy says everyone has to keep them on while at least one person is left in the room still working with reactants... even if they're on the other side of the lab. They are moderately uncomfortable with glasses, but tolerable for a 2 hour long lab time."
5,"A ""Gypsy"" after my own heart!",Mr. Kostroffs book is a wonderful read for true theatre junkies and anyone else who wants behind the scenes tidbits. I am a true road dog myself and have been on several national tours and Michaels book is an accurate and entertaining account of life on a broadway tour. I strongly encourage you to buy it for yourself and a friend. I devoured it in two nights. Its the type of book you just cant leave alone.
5,Every Actor (or wannabe) Must Read This!,"This is the real deal. Truly fascinating and entertaining. May be read as a fun behind-the-scenes adventure and also as a true account of what it is really like to be a touring working actor on the road. Fans of theater, SHOW BIZ, The Producers, Les Miz,Mel Brooks, comedy, etc. will go crazy. Simply said: Get it. Read it."
5,A Must-Read for Those Who Love Good Writing,"Having read this book myself, and being in the business myself, I consider this a must-read for fellow actors. However, my friends who are NOT in the business enjoyed this book, simply for Michael's skill in telling a story with all the local color. He makes you feel like you're there with him! I highly recommend this book."
5,An Amazing Piece of History,"Frances Willard was an amazing woman! This 700-page first-edition 1889 autobiography shows amazing insight and perspective that is pertinent even to our generation, offering wisdom of gender roles, in addition to an amazingly comprehensive history of the temperance movement and of life in that era. Her writing style, vocabulary and command of the English language are exemplary, and her perspective on historic events, including the Civil War, is truly fascinating and fresh, coming from a voice that lived and observed them, and preserved in the voice and language of the period. Written when she was 50 years old, this account of her life, work and observations, based in part on her comprehensive journals kept since age 12, is well worth the time it takes to read it."
5,Damme Good After All These Years!,"The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a very good film! Van Damme's best and most action packed since Wake of Death. Seriously, all the good ingredients are in there, guys. There's plenty of hand to hand fighting in The Shepherd, even the gratuitous bar fight. There's a likable chemistry between the lead and supporting cast, and the villains are well picked. There's also a lot of good soundtrack work done in a style familiar to spaghetti westerns."
3,Not too bad!,"Although Van Damme has had fewer stinkers than those of his peers, he's had his share. This, however, isn't too bad. It's more polished and the dialogue more believable. But like so many others of this genre, it relies too much on formula. It's very predictable and making Bulgaria look like New Mexico was a bit of a stretch. In the end, though, it was entertaining. I like Van Damme and I hope he does more, but it would be good to see some surprises for a change."
3,"Dirty cops, dirty border and dirty drugs","I like bunny rabbits too. It doesn't seem like a tough guy's pet?Sort of a twist on a boy named Sue.The idea of an armored car full of drugs with nuns as a coveris pretty much that kind of thing you expect.Here in San Diego we have off road / dune buggies and the drugscame across with mules and even tunnels.The cops in Mexico are almost as poor as the peopleand there is a tradition of selling out, it seems.But having trouble seems to be what a border is about?It actually seems like both sides are on the take?We don't seem to have heroes, just more peoplethan are legal..."
3,"Not Bad, but not great either","Issac Florentine has been a hit or miss with me. He does great action films like Undisputed 2 and 3, then he makes movies like Ninja and The Shepherd. There is some good action in this film courtesy of mr. Scott adkins. This is the first time Damme and Adkins appear on screen together, and they have a nice little fight at the end also. But the story was lacking, but I have seen worse straight to video films from mr. Damme. So this movie is a good time waster or if your an Adkins junkie!"
2,Sheepish,"Oh brother, where do I begin with this one. The first 30 minutes is full of bad editing, poor dialogue, and a weak script. Near the end of the movie is does start to have some sense of direction but too little too late. There is little character development on this weak effort form JCVD. Overall, I am not even sure why they made this stinker. I give it two thumbs up for the female lead as she is hott!!Want a really good JCVD movie then check out, ""Maximum Risk."" Great story line, well acted, and just plain fun and entertaining. ""The Shepard"" only made me want to shepard my you-know-what right out of the room. Aaarrrggghhhh!"
2,So So Movie,"Better than most of his recent movies, but not as good as you hope for. His older movies are way way better!"
5,Good chronicle of Tai Chi journey,"This is not a book of Tai Chi technique(s). It does not claim to be one, however. This is a book describing the experiences of a long time practitioner of Tai Chi. It has made me want to study the art."
3,"A good read but,","A good read but wants desperately to be the definitive novel of the 1990's; having to give up what you want to do for the good of family and others. Also the novel is very predictable (especially the events in Montana) and some of the characters are very stereotypical (Rudy Warren, I hated the way he was written). Still I would recommend it based on the fact that many of us wish our lives could be changed and this book makes for a fast and enjoyable read."
2,A little too comfortable and too easy to predict...,The Big Picture reminded me of this or that as I was reading it. I thought that I must have read it before and I realized as I finished it that I had. This book was predictable at best and the main character ends by beginning again too eventually disappear again. I hope that this character dies so that we do not have to keep reliving his rebirths.
5,Great first novel!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this magnificent yarn. Kennedy possesses the ability to captivate the reader, making the protagonist so very human and likeable that it's impossible not to root for him throughout. The plot is lively, with clever twists. I like the way Kennedy weaves humor into the story."
4,Keeps reminding you of Hitchcock,"A great entertaining read, the plot has all kinds of twists and turns."
4,"Incredibly fast-paced, I was breathless to the very end.","I read an advanced copy of this book, I work in abook store, and I have been telling customers tobuy it ever since. It has an unbelievable pace. Ididn't read this book, I raced through it. Istrongly recommend it. Much better than ""The Partner""and with a similar plot. In a word, excellent!"
4,Interesting book and a good read,Douglas Kennedy has written a well paced book which grabs your attention and manages to keep it till the end. The back of the cover first caught me with the sysnopsis of how Ben had everything a successfull man could aim for but didnt have happiness.Once you start reading Douglas builds up the pace slowly and leads us through Ben's failed marraige and his love for photography. Once Ben come to know about his wife's infidelity and what happens next makes for very good reading. Though his stay in Montanna does sound like fairy tale bit. Which is the reason I havent given a 5 star to this.I did find the story so interesting that I narrated the whole story to my wife after reading the book. Looking forward to read the more of Douglas Kennedy
3,"Good but,","is there a ""new trend"" in mistery writing, we find on every page the price of the fancy camera of the hero paid nnnn$ and his wonderful coat from what's his name for 2000$ and so on. It looks more and more like a commercial catalogue. I've personnaly noted this ""new trend"" in Cornwell's book which I like very much. Nevertheless it's a good book."
4,Audio version,"I actually listened to this book on audio, rather than read it, and I truly enjoyed it. The reader, annoying at first, actually turned out to be quite entertaining.In terms of the story, I thought it had too many twists and turns for its own good. I also couldn't believe that Ben (main protagonist) didn't miss his family (especially his son) that much after leaving for the west.The ending was extraordinarily weak as mentioned already, but all in all, I was never bored."
3,Yea Right,"I liked the idea at first, then I got into the story and I am wondering - wait a minute, has this ever worked? And why am I cheering for this guy? I got to wondering how could Mr. do right turn into Ted Bundy overnight? The book is well written and I liked the main character, but I just had a hard time believing the story and that was before the end. I may be a little hard on the author, again the book was interesting - I finished it, the characters were good and the first part moved along well. I just did not believe the story line and that left me second guessing everything from them on. And why Montana, go to LA - it would have been more fun."
2,A Grisham-wannabe and just as bad (spoilers at end),"I should have trusted my instincts and put this book down after the first nine pages. Ben has just introduced us, in mind-numbing detail, to the costs of the contents of his closet and darkroom. Sure, Kennedy's point is to show how materialistic this guy is, but the writing is tedious, repetitive, and cheap. But I read on.I must say, ""Part I"" of this book (the setup) is somewhat interesting. It reads a bit like ""The Firm"" but more intriguing. And there's only one moment where you feel as if you have to willfully suspend your disbelief.But the remaining two-thirds? Yecch.I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who decides to read the book, so I won't give away any of the plot devices, so let's just say that the number of coincidences and contrived situations in the second part of the book are greater than anything I've read recently.The New York Times reviewer hit it right on the nose."
4,"Very good, a cracking story","Okay, so some parts of this story are a little far-fetched, but so what? Good fiction, in my humble opinion, should be escapism. This was a cracking good story, with a thumping great plot and good characterisation. I stormed my way through it and was sorry when it ended."
4,A compelling book whose exhuberance outweighs its defects.,"This book was compelling and exhuberant. I finished it in 24 hours and thought about it for days. Forget the coincidences and unlikenesses, echoes of melodrama even, such as when Ben flees the photography PR schmooze thing just ahead of his wife. I couldn't forget the image of the town bum asking for a glass then removing his full dentures into them. That typified the sheer energy and to repeat myself, ""exhuberance"" of the book."
4,Great from start to finish.,"Great page-turner, has me looking for more D. Kennedy books. I just got another today and looking foward to reading it. I won't bore anyone with the plot, I'll just say it was good enough for me to highly recomend. Doesn't require alot of in depth thought to enjoy the book like some do. Only for 50-75 pgs or so through the middle did it drag out a little, but I think that's only because the rest of the book is pretty swift-paced and keeps you thinking ""what next?"". You won't be dissappointed with this one."
4,Can you get away with murder?!,"The start is excellent. But after the murdering it gets you wondering about the human feelings of the main character. He seems to long for his family, but starts to do the other way. But at some time his dream as a person with big pictures comes true. But the happiness is not for him. In the end it is getting unreal as his wife steps in to give him a life he never expected."
2,You have better things to do than read this book!,"This was probably one of the worst books I've read this year - - and I read a lot.The story was too contrived...it was as if the author was just printing out what he would do if HE could fulfill all of his personal fantasies.I hope his wife doesn't get too close to him when he has a wine bottle in his hands.Find something else to do, like polish silver, iron clothes, clean house, do yard work or wash/wax your car. After you've finished those chores, at least you will have something tangible for your efforts.""The Big Picture"" is just a piece of fluff, easily tossed out by the spring breeze."
2,"Hackneyed, implausible plot dies under weight of bad writing","This book is exciting in its depiction of gruesome details, but otherwise is burdened by amateurish writing and a creaky plot that finally shivers and collapses under its own implausibility. A bad guy does a very bad thing and gets away with it on ingenuity and pure dumb - and I mean dumb - luck. The protagonist is a creep of the highest order and does not deserve our sympathy. It is neither fun nor interesting to root for him, especially after he commits his crime and the true silliness of the plot takes over. Read it if you like munching on details - he does that well - but if you want to scream when characters talk nonstop in clichés like ""I forked over the 20 bucks"" then be afraid ... be very afraid"
4,Well written!,This story is a great example of the negative effects that our actions can have. It is very entertaining to read. I highly recomended.
5,A Real Page-Turner To The End,"This is quite simply the best novel I've read in years! I couldn't put it down. After this one, you'll be sleep deprived, but thrilled and looking for more from Douglas Kennedy."
4,The story is not new,"The story is not new, Patricia Highsmith used a similar plot in her first Ripley novel. But it`s definitely well done until the protagonist comes to Montana. After that it seems as if a different author completed writing the book, there`s not as much suspense as was in the first part of the book. Nevertheless it`s a very compelling story."
4,excellent rollercoaster ride that lasts throughout the book,"This thriller is about every man's worst fear, his wife having an affair and the severe repercussions he has created from dealing with the affair. It has excellent plot that is complex, yet incredibly plausible. From the moment I picked this book up, I could not put it down. A must read for anyone who likes fast paced, highly emotional books that deal with modern life"
4,I could put it down - but not for long.,"Yes, it was a page turner, and yet not very satisfying.I thought Beth was a crud and ended up feeling sorry forBen even after all of his dastardly deeds. It was way past believable at every turn and yet I couldn't wait toget home from work and read some more. The ending wasdisappointing, but I'll be watching for this author's next project. What a dichotomous review--but I would recommend this book--sort of"
3,A wannabe photog uses murder to change his life.,"Ben Bradford is bored with his humdrum Wall Street life. In a flash of rage all is changed and Ben is able to hide his former self and become the photographer of his dreams. All goes according to plan until a Montana forest fire exposes his talents and lies to the woman he loves. Good plot, starts a bit too slow; nice lessons on how to become someone new"
1,NOT HAPPY,"CAN'T CLOSE COVER ON MODEL 8025 ULTRA MEASURE MASTER.WHICH WAS IN THE SET I BOUGHT.THE ONE IN CHINA, YOU BOUGHT THIS FROM ;MUST HAVE USED SMALLER RUBBER MOLD THAN MOST."
1,doesn't fit for s**t,case is hard to snap shut and bulges at the sides. big gaps at the sides aren't going to keep all the crap from getting inside. might work for other construction masters but not the CM5.
1,Ooops!,"I'm sure that it's a perfectly good book, but unfortunately it's in German, and I don't speak or read German. Must have missed that when I ordered it."
1,Very Disappointed,I've ordered quite a few things from Amazon and never been disappointed even once until ordering this skirt. I ordered it June 30 and after not hearing a word 2 weeks later I contacted the company and they had not even attempted to ship it. I will never order from this company again.
4,I like these atlas/gazeteers by Delmorme,"I have purchased these for Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado and Utah so far. They are great to take along on a road trip as they are very detailed and show you where so much is. Elevation, rivers, places to camp etc are just a few of the things in these books. I will continue to buy other states based in the western U.S. as I plan to continue to take road trips."
4,Very good recording. A classic.,"""The Honeydripper"", the title track, has one of those lazy, underhanded shuffle beats that drummers today just don't play. Ben Dixon really knew how to propel an organ combo, as did Grant Green (guitar). This is one of Green's first appearances on record (if not the first, at least on a major label). Right after this, Green would make a series of recordings with Lou Donaldson, Jimmy Smith, Stanley Turrentine, Lee Morgan, and others on the Blue Note label, before starting a solo career. Jimmy Forrest rounds out the group on tenor. Very good, well rounded recording."
4,Very Cool Album,"i hadn't listened to this album in ages&then I just happen to be going through my Discs&Stumbled on this one.had to hear ""Dink's Blues"" Jack Mcduff was grooving on the Organ&around the 4:30 mark Grant Green laid down His signature Guitar Licks.the drumming was real smooth which was done by Ben Dixon.Jimmy Forrest was cool on Sax.dug the arrangements&overall flow of this Album.the title cut is smooth as well.Brother Jack Mcduff much like Jimmy smith were some of the Godfathers of the Organ.you always knew there touch on the Instrument. this is a cool saturday&Beyond listening type of Album."
4,Aloha!,"This Hawaiian adventure was one of the better spin-offs from _Summer of Night_. Though Cordie Cooke's description borders on the outright grotesque, she remained just as likable - if not more so - than in her first appearance. There is just something bluntly charming about her. I liked the way Simmons intertwined the historical aspect of Mark Twain's visit to Hawaii through Aunt Kidder's journal entries.Full of excitement, and even with a cameo appearance by Mike O'Rourke, I had a lot of fun reading this. Basing everything off Hawaiian mythology made it even more unique and giant pigs, sharks and volcano eruptions aside, makes me want to go back there! A fun and summery adventure, and a welcome addition to Simmons' versatile bibliography. Simmons is very talented, but he really shines with the historical sections."
4,Battling monsters in Hawaii,"In Fires of Eden, the talented author of such diverse works as Carrion Comfort, Song of Kali and The Hollow Man utilizes Hawaiian mythology to great effect. Fires tells the story of Eleanor Perry, a young woman inspired to visit the resort island of Mauna Pele by the events described in the diary of her great aunt Kidder. The diary relates Kidder's adventures on the island in 1866, when she and brash newspaperman Samuel Clemens teamed up to battle a horde of evil creatures threatening the local populace. From the time Eleanor sets foot on the island, she becomes embroiled in a similar adventure. Simmons alternates between the events described in the diary and Eleanor's modern day experiences, all the while building toward a gripping and surprising finale."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dan Simmons wanting to show he could write a standard type novel? Got this because of the setting, somewhere that we lived.Set around the resorts, as well as some of the travel on the saddle road over the middle, a bit of a low key thriller."
4,"Great research, good storytelling.","While this story is certainly well crafted, and is the best modernized version of Hawaiian myth I've ever read, its ending is awfully formulaic for a writer who's created such masterpieces in the past.Simmons does prove here that he can tell a ""double story"" as well as anyone, skipping back and forth between the present and the past."
3,Highly Overrated,"Penguin Guide To Jazz has this album/Cd rated as ""Crown Status""...out of, I would guess 500,000 ratings only maybe400 cd's was given this rating....I don't ""see it"". For one it is a Solo performance..You must have a very good attentionspan (or a lot of time on your hands) to not only sit through one person playing a Saxaphone but to rate in the 95th percentileof all Jazz Cd's....I simply disagree and fail to agree thereby not agreeing............"
1,I Can Play That!,"And I'm not even a sax player! How do these people get away with this rubbish? I'm an avant garde musician i.e. I play any old trash. Not in key, no rhythm, no harmony, just sheer irritating noise! Its literally just a load of bum notes without the ""oops"" in. Unlistenable!"
1,bad,Do not buy unless you like being awoken while you're sleeping for false alarms. Huge waste of time and money. Buy another brand like Kidde.
1,Frustrating Alarm,I got eight of these alarms. They were hard wire with backup batteries. Every alarm needed a replacement battery after I installed it. They all gave low battery alarms after I installed them. Occasionally one of them (I don't kow which one) keeps chirping. Drives me crazy.
4,WORKS WELL SO FAR...,This smoke detector replaced one that was not hardwired into our system. We reviewed which item would fit into the existing outlet and chose the best product suited for our needs--BRK BRANDS 7010B won out over all others.
5,BRK Brands Hardwire Smoke Alarm,"The previous version of this smoke alarm lasted for over 10 years, and so far the new version is just as reliable."
5,Most bang for your buck,"If you need to mount a fire/smoke detector in a hallway, near a bathroom, than this is the detector for you. I've had zero false alarms. The price was lower than most other detectors. It seems to be working well.-J19Updated - 1/5/09. The alarm is working working very well, and went off when I had left something on the stove. The alarm went off when the forgotten food on my stove was smoking badly, but before it caught fire. Still no false alarms.-J19"
2,"If you are building from scratch, don't do it","We keep replacing the model that came in our new construction. We have had to return this item 2 times because it kept sounding, even when new. Replacements end up working OK when you find the right one. The lates purchase came with a string of wires attached to a different connecting head. We don't need it b/c our house is already wired for this model, but it made me think that next time I'm going to look harder for a different brand and do some electrical work to change the attachment somehow. This brand is also very sensitive (which may or may not be a bad thing) and it constantly goes off in the kitchen area when cooking. It is sensitive to humidity, as well. The one in the master bedroom needs replacing the most, likely b/c of steam then dust build up."
4,Good replacement,"I bought this unit to replace my existing BRK ionization detectors. So far so good. No false alarms, no alarms in the middle of the night. I guess we'll just have to see how they hold up with time."
2,False alarms!,This is the second model of BRK brands I have tried. Seems quality control on these are only slightly better than the 7020B. Have had 2 out of 9 of these fail in first 4 weeks.
5,No more noise when we use the oven,"The builder of our home (1998) put the smoke detector for the main floor less than 10 feet from the stove, so it was going off constantly. Our dog was a wreck, he didn't know where to hide. I was able to find this model which is designed to go in places where no reasonable person would install an alarm, and it has never gone off since. Replacement was easy, and it did NOT chirp when it was installed. What a relief!"
2,"New alarms, same problem","I purchased 6 new alarms to replace another BRK/First Alert alarm model that constantly went off for no reason. Less than a month after replacing them, 1 out of 6 of the 7010B has the same problem, and of course, it only takes one to create a really annoying situation. I purchased this because it looked like it was getting good reviews, but I really wish I'd gone to a completely different brand. Oh, and there it goes again.Customer service seems to be quite good. I called today and they are shipping a new one + no need to ship old one back."
1,Not what I ordered,"This product was crap. The suit i received didn't look anything like the picture. A friend and I ordered the same suit, so I thought, but I received this flimsy gray suit thing that looked liked something from the 80s. I went a head and put the suit on. It was so uncomfortable due to the fact that there were rubber band used around the neck, arm and ankles. I had to pull the rubber band from around the neck so I could breath. after two workouts the suit started to rip in the crotch. A few days later my friend received hers, which was the correct one like on the picture."
3,Bandolino Women's Jealous Slide,"Really good looking dress sandal, unfortunately it runs narrow and I don't think a half size up would have helped."
1,very disappointed,Very disappointed. I got 2 uses out of this belt and it split almost completely in half. Good thing I ordered 2 or I'd be headed to the store and spending 50 bucks. Pisses me off I have to pull it all apart AGAIN to put the second belt on after such little use.Claire Clayton
3,In a word: Odd,"I agree with the previous (and only) customer review. Maybe the culture in the antebellum South was so totally different from today that the modern mind just doesn't get it, but I thought many of the conversations, expressed sentiments, and actions were just plain odd. I think part of the problem is that none of the characters were developed enough that they made any sense.Worse still is that the main character, Elizabeth, is pretty hard to like, as are most of the others. I kept hoping throughout this book and the sequel, The Stars of the South, that she would redeem herself in some way; many times she almost did, but she never quite made it. As for the others, I found most of them very tiresome.Especially disappointing was that the most interesting character was killed in a duel. He was the best part of the story."
4,Excellent Read,"Interesting and extremely readable, this book made me realize how much I had bought into the California myth as I was growing up in the 60's, as well as allowing me some enjoyable trips down memory lane. The author's writing style allowed me to see the cause and effects of California pop culture of the 50's and 60's from a much wider frame of reference; educating me without drowning me in pompous academic babbling.I heartily recommend this book!"
4,Perfect for puzzle lovers,"My only complaint about these panoramic puzzles is that there isn't one from my city! Boston is very picturesque, and there is a lot of colors in this puzzle so you are not trying to match up a bunch of blue sky pieces together. great fun for everyone!"
1,this is a history book not a travel guide,"seriously, terrible pictures, average text and no maps. The few pictures are from ancient times. seriously the pictures about the metro must have been from the 70's i cant use this thing, very hard to find the sections. i had to buy eyewitness travel guide which i can use and it comes with a map, so i can get around in the city. This book is going in the garbage. i am sorry i bought it."
2,"Doesn't ""Officially"" measure up","Bought this book because I wouldn't go to Disney World without the Unofficial Guide. Several errors. Should have mentioned the Circulator. We took a family of 4. The review on several attractions - including the International Spy Musuem contained too much of the author's own political agenda. There were not enough family oriented and reasonably priced restaurants reviewed. I discovered I was only a couple blocks from a lot of good restaurants, but couldn't figure out, from this book how far they were. I would buy the other books before this one."
5,great guide for washington DC,"My daughter recommended this book to me, It is the best guide book that I have ever read. It is her personal view of WashingtonGreat book to take with you."
5,Don't leave home without it!,"Great suggestions for how to see the city...not just what to see. Helps you plan your itinerary to get the most out of your trip. Lists sights several different ways, by interests, location or ratings.Love this book!"
5,Great information and details of attractions,"Used this book to plan what to see in a limited 3 day visit and was very pleased. Also bought Eyewitness guide, but this is the one I'll be taking along."
5,A must have to visit D.C.,"I purchased this book prior to a trip to D.C. Even though my husband grew up in the area we found it very beneficial for our short two day visit. We had not visited in many years and found the ""don't drive your car into D.C."" advise was truly great advise. We enjoyed the train ride in and considered it just part of the adventure. We highly recommend this one."
5,Superb Travel Book,"Almost perfect DC travel guide. I went to a national chain bookstore and studiedevery book they had on DC. The unofficial guide is the best for general info on what to do,see and eat in DC.Good size not too bulky but really concise. Maps and all. I also purchased DK Eyewitness to DC because I liked the idea that it offered floor plans of some of the major sites and color pictures. I highly recommend theUnofficial Guide.Roben"
4,"Decent book, but is outdated.","We bought this book to help plan our trip to DC and it was helpful with providing things to do and helps rate things that different age groups would like/not like to do.The book is somewhat outdated/not complete though. Some information was incorrect or maybe geared more towards peak travel periods as we went after labor day and a lot of the opening/closing times of buildings were incorrect. One exampe, the book suggests getting up very early to reserve tickets for the Jefferson Monument, we decided to take our chances instead of getting up very early in the morning as the book suggested. We went and got tickets for the 2:00 tour at about 1:50.If you do get this book I would recommend using it as a source to get ideas and then researching the actual attractions on-line to get actual opening/closing times."
2,a bit incomplete ...,"What I liked: the review and description of the museums and the breakdown of public and tour transportion options. Other than that I feel I was missing out on a true city experience. The restaurant reviews were all over the place (and I think it could use more selection; or perhaps a map for the walking tourist to find great places to chow). No sense/description of the neighborhoods. How about good places for music/culture? Not included here. I would have also appreciated some pictures. All in all, it helped with a trip but I was disappointed."
4,pagan-prog-folk-celtic-metal,"pagan, prog, brit-folk, celtic metal with a female singer who sounds alot like Annie Haslam. Pretty cool if you're into that sort of thing."
2,This CD isn't a 5 in my opinion,"I bought this CD based on other people's opinions from Amazon that had listened to it. After getting my copy and hearing it, it was defintely not a great CD in my opinion. Some of the songs werre okay, but the CD just never even phased me one bit. Some songs just really hit you whether it's the music or lyrics, but no songs in this album really made me listen twice. Sorry to all Phoenix's fans out there, but it was a nice try CD that didn't rate high on my chart."
5,Great music,This woman has talent. She has an ability to make you believe what she is singing. Very good vocals and instrumentation.
4,Riveting Account of the Fall of Phnom Penh,"The book opens with some less-than-successful recollections of the time Swain spent in SE Asia during the wars: it's familiar territory, and his writing is not strong enought to handle the complicated emotions and memories that Michael Herr so successfully managed in Dispatches.But then the book turns to a fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge. Here Swain shines: his narrative is straightforward -- with little of the mawkishness that mars the opening ruminations -- riveting and horrifying. Swain opted to stay on in Phnom Penh as the Khmer approached and entered the city, and the story he got by staying is . . . well, it's pretty overwhelming."
5,A great first toy,"This is the perfect toy for your infant. Soft and durable, it makes a perfect companion. It's very well made and spot cleaning is quite easy. My three month old loves it. His eyes light up whenever he sees it. After seeing his connection with this toy, I went online and bought the other two characters for him."
2,Judas Priest Hell Bent For Metal,"This CD isn't great. There's too much death metal, where the singing is just brutal. There are a few good songs: Sentinel, Beyond the Realms of Death, Seeler, and Desert Plains. Some other songs, were simply an embarrassment. The vocalist's attempt to hit the high note in ""The Ripper,"" is nothing more than ridiculous. The guitar solo in the beginning of ""Metal Meltdown"" was omitted. The worst song, is probably ""Electric Eye,"" performed by ""Scary German Guy."" Not only was the ""Hellion"" left out, but the singing sucked, and the guitar solo was HORRIBLY butchered. I would only recommend this CD if you're a die hard priest fan who doesn't mind bad vocals."
4,"Not as good as the Legends of Metal CD's, but pretty cool...","Like most tribute albums, a mix of decent, great, and lousy. Low points...Sanctorum, Scary German Guy, and Aurora Borealis. High points...Angel Corpse's great death metal version of ""Eat Me Alive,"" Winter's Bane's version of ""Steeler,"" Steel Prophet's take on ""Dreamer Deceiver,"" and especially Vital Remains' tuned down but otherwise just about note-perfect version of ""You've Got Another Thing Comin'""Recommended if you're a Priest fan and also happen to like death metal."
3,Its definitely bent part 1.,Winter's Bane's cover of Steeler was very good musically. The lead singer isn't Ripper Owens on this one so I think it could have been better but he does a good job. Agent Steel's cover of Beyond the Realms of Death is very good as well. The one by Blind Guardian is slightly better. People will either love or hate the cover of the Ripper by Equinox. It grew on me. Dreamer Deciever by Steel Prophet has been on several Priest tribute CDs and is a favorite. The Sentinel by Prototype and Desert Plains by Division are good as well. As for the rest of the covers they are either death metal or black metal bands mauling classic Priest songs. But if you are a big Priest fan the other songs I mentioned are worth it.
3,"Good, but...","My two year-old loves the book and loves the pictures, but I felt like it didn't always make sense and could have been written better. Sometimes the authors force the text to fit the form they have set up. The Tracker goes ""squelch sqelch""?? But, the pictures are good and my son LOVES it. I just wish I was happier reading it."
4,"""BASED ON"" the original - missing lots of text!","I ordered this after getting tired of checking out the big hardcover Dig Dig Digging from the library over and over. Didn't realize this one is ""based on"" the original. Missing at least half of the pages of the original, and the text is much, much shorter. A fun book for a toddler, but my preschoolers miss the rest of the story! (Hate to admit it, but so do I.)"
5,Great Book,My two year old loves this book. It's one of the books in his collection that I don't mind reading over and over again. Nice illustrations and wonderful writing.
5,Here to buy it after extended loan from the library...,"My 22-month old son just LOVES this book. He is napping with it right now. We checked it out from the library and I'm here to pick one up - he likes it that much. He is especially into garbage trucks and fire trucks right now, and they're both in there. Also a fan of dump trucks and ""diggers"", so we're getting our money's worth.The best part is that all of the machines need a rest at the end of the day - a good transition for us at bedtime, from 'dig, dig, digging' all day, to 'they can rest all night'. A stroke of genius, at least in our case...a big 'thank you' to the author!"
4,So So,"This author chose a wierd selection of words to describe some of the sounds that the machines make. I don't like to read it because it reads wierd but my 2yr old son likes it alright. It is not his favorite either. The good thing it does teach is the ""ing"" variances of words like dig, dig, digging and squelch, squelch, squelching. A the end of each description it says ""and they can work all day"". My son has caught on to this usage of words so he has learned something from it."
4,Yellow fever setten in.,"Wow that Shu Qi is a stone cold fox and that girl can act. No joke I love this film and this lady is so good I was really starting to get the creeps. The story is top shelf and it makes this a much better film then the ""Grudge"" or ""Dark Water"" in my mind.By this film for around $6.00 + p&h; and you will be getting a great deal.Barry"
3,I see you too,"Danny and Oxide Pang follow-up their 2002 horror movie with this non-related sequel. It's not as effective as the original, but still has a few scenes worth watching for.Joey Cheng (Shu Qi, who you might recognize from her terrible performance from Transporter) is a young, pregnant woman who attempts suicide, and fails, only to obtain the ability to see ghosts. There's no plot though. Some of the ghosts seem cursory and are never fully explained. They're weird and visible just for the sake of it, with no explanation. There's a slight mystery involving the woman Joey sees lurking in the train station which leads to sweet ending, but it's not really enough to sustain a 95-minute running time.It falls short of the Eye, though there are a couple of tense moments and it's not completely dissatisfying.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The only extra is a trailer."
2,A LITTLE CREEPY AND WEIRD,"IF YOU WATCHED THE FIRST ONE DON'T EXPECT THIS ONE TO BE ALIKE. THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME QUALITY OR CONTENT. EVEN THOUGHT THE STORY IS ORIGINAL, STILL CREEPY, VERY BLOODY AND DISGUSTING AT MANY SCENES. YOU CAN'T COMPARE IT TO THE FIRST ONE. IF YOU LIKE WEIRD STORIES ABOUT SPIRITS AND YOU LOVE CREEPY MOVIES, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU. I WILL STICK TO THE FIRST ONE."
1,Pathetic,"This movie was ridiculous. Not only was the acting pathetic but the script was horrible. I kept staying with it in hope that something good would occur but it just got worse. What a waste of time.Head for the hills if they make The Eye 3.Port St Lucie, Florida"
3,Kind of amateurish...,"After reading less than 30 pages and the back cover, I had already figured out who the killer was. Also, Mariah seems to be in dire need of an editor. The characters were okay, but I was not excited about this story. I bought this based on the current rating which has me questioning the tastes of the reviewers."
4,Intense Thriller With a Big Twist,"I've read many fiction books where law enforcement officers have to stop a dangerous, cunning killer. This book is better than most - a page-turner that I could not put down. The main character, Kendra Smith, was well-developed which allowed me to better relate to her actions and motivations. Several side plots were nicely tied up near the end of the book. There was also a big twist that left me saying,""Oh my goodness, if this is true. . .get out of the house now!"" If you like simple plots, a plodding pace, and cardboard heroes, then this is NOT the book for you. :<)"
4,the armageddon blues,"The Armageddon Blues, I found was incomparable to nearly any other sci-fi title I have ever read. It is replete with concepts and implications of science and reality that astound the imagination and occasionally are quite hilarious. Though the actual form of the book can be a bit rough and difficult to read at times, the content more then makes up for this. The ""enemy of entropy"" Georges Vezina driving on the road, with the stereo, heater, and air conditioner all simultaneously operating, left me laughing for minutes. An excellent book, by an excellent imaginative mind."
1,Oh boy...For professional reference only,"As a fitness professional and certified yoga teacher I would not recommend this book to practice with or take advice from. I actually warn my clients NOT to do some of the things they suggest (such as pushing on knees to get a deeper stretch) unless they are eager to injur themselves. Unless you are a professional and are able to sort through the exercises to determine which are safe and which are not, I would look elsewhere for advice on stretching and/or yoga.However, if you are trained in biomechanics or movement this could be a good reference for ideas for partner classes, workshops or demonstrations (but you will have to know what to leave out). The participants will need to be fairly flexible already.Some of the pictures are cool but the quality of the printing is not that high, so they are more grey than black and white."
4,Let's Yoga Together,"Great photos. Good Poses. I'm a yoga instructor, so I was hoping to add some fun poses to my partner yoga repetoire. There weren't too many new poses for my skill level. But if you're new to partner yoga, or need help remember some cool moves this is a handy book."
5,Beautiful Book,This is a great book to get anyone excited about the possibilities of partner yoga. The pictures are beautiful and the amount of poses is incredible. I love this book.
4,"Small, Handy and practical","I havent read it completely - but so far so good. Love the size as I can take it to class when I teach. Also like the pictures and explanations. Would love if they recommended different sequencing for a 20 min to 1 hour partner yoga session. Don't know if they do since I havent read it thoroughly. Also, recommend any adjustments for different types of bodies and range of flexibility."
3,Is this what you really need.,"This Nolo Book is getting a poor review only because its companion book ""Working With Independent Contractors"" was so good. This book is basically a limited reprint of the above cited book with a few additional specalized contracts. If you need those specalized contracts then this may be worth your money, otherwise get ""Working With Independent Contractors"" its great."
3,"More than I wanted, and less.","This is not a book for the faint hearted. As good as it is, and it is good, and well written, it is not a book for the casual, or even interested, reader. The book is filled with graphs, charts, and technical evaluations. if you know your captain, this is the place to find out why and when, and where he served. The book does not give enough detail to feel the spirit of most of these men. For that, look to the books titled ""Broadside"", or ""The Sea Warriors""."
4,Great!,"Most histories of this era carefully walk us through the major events of the period, laying out other events as necessary to advance the author's point of view. This book takes a different, and refreshing approach: it focuses specifically on frigate captains -- the dashing, courageous fighters who took the war to mouth of French harbours and allied shipping on the high seas. The is well written and is a quick read. But don't let the quick read fool you -- it's a great history worth reading."
1,Quilt In A Day....NOT!!!!!,"I bought this book for my friend Phyliss and I. We were going to make a Double Irish Chain together. Now I'm not a real experienced quilter, but I do know my way around a quilt pattern. My friend Phyliss.....Well she's been making quilts for at least 70 years, so even if I didn't know something she would.....This is the WORSE instruction book I have ever seen. We finally gave up after 3 days of trying to figure out how to make this darn quilt. It was if the book was written in gobbly goop!!Seens as if I have thrown my money away, almost $70.00, because I don't have this quilt made and it cannot be made from the instructions in this book.....Do yourself a favor and buy someone else's book. Maybe then you will be able to make a beautiful Double Irish Chain!! This book is worthless!!"
4,Irish Chain in a Day,I loaned my original copy of this book to someone who loved it more than me. I was thrilled to be able to find a replacement copy on Amazon.com at such a reasonable price. The book came in great condition as described.
2,Simple Design - but not sturdy,"I like the idea of a simple tag I can write on, and it has a reflector, but the plastic chipped within a day of my pets playing together. Tyhe paper and the plastic were scratched-the paper was unreadable."
3,Not what I expected,They tried to squeeze too big of a state into too small of a book. Detail is not on par with other atlases in this series. Should have been divided into an east and west set.
2,Disappointing errors in my copy,"When I received my copy of the Gazetteer I found 4 pages missing and 4 other pages duplicated. I ordered two other Gazetteers for Wyoming and Idaho at the same time and they were OK but since I discovered the problem while on our trip, the Gazetteer I purchased for Montana was effectively useless."
2,Unjustifiable fame,"This book is used is several introductory courses on finance at MBA/Masters level, but it is a really mess: we don't know where we are, what we are doing and why. It confuses us. Sometimes the authors use summations, sometimes integrals on the same topic. The reader should be very cautious not to fall in its traps. In another words, the book has a bad notation and organization.The last chapter, however, covers the econometric questions mainly on CAPM estimation problems. This is a very useful chapter."
4,Great tester,we use this product all the time in our business testing engines it never offers a false positive the product is easy to use and is well designed i recommend this product to any one that is looking to test an engine for the presence of exhaust gases in the coolant
5,works great,"i like the two stage testers better then the single stage. very accurate., during testing, be sure to test after the thermostat opens, where the coolant has circulated."
5,Confirmed a blown gasket on first application,This is one of those tools that can make the diagnosis of a blown head gasket easier especially if it is a small one.. It detected a suspected blown head gasket on the first use.
3,Great TV! Pray it doesn't break.,"I loved this TV until the motherboard fried on it. Called Customer service the next day, 25 minute wait... great. Finally got a representative and they were fine everything was taken care of except they wouldn't pay the shipping for sending their broken TV back to them. Alright, I'm kind of in a pickle so I'll pay that shipping. ""May take up to 7 days to process"", are you kidding. What am I supposed to do now? Take up crafts? Two weeks later call again. Another 25 minute wait, now I'm upgraded to priority processing, call in 2 days for your tracking number. Call 4 days later, ""It hasn't gone out yet, but we'll put you on our priority list and call you with the tracking number hopefully it should go out tomorrow."" 3 days later call them back again, not only no shipping number but nothing they can do about it now. 3 weeks no replacement... horrible."
2,"Good TV, Bad Company","I purchased this TV several years ago and it was a great tv in the short time it worked unfortunatly after about 14 months it stopped working so then i began the task of trying to get it fixed.here is where i began to regret buying this TV. First off Olevia doesn't make any of the parts on their own (my particular tv was made with LG-Phillips components i know they also use many sharp components as well as some other companies) The only iteam that Olevia does make is the TV case. so when it comes to any replacement (in warranty or not) Olevia is completely worthless.I would suggest to anyone considering buying a Olevia TV is that you just dont. Spend the extra money on a name that will stand behind their product, and one that will have a fair chance of repair if anything should happen in the future. I have spent a year trying to track down a replacement part for my 237V and in that time have failed to find any (Including contacting LG-Phillips)."
3,nice but,The shade is good and nice but it keeps detaching from the car window and I don't know how to fix that!
3,A little Disappointed,"I know I should have paid attention to the size (particularly the width) of the shade, but I didn't expect it to be that narrow!My daughter still complains about the sun streaming in through the window, as the shade does not ""shade"" the 3/4 of the window (which is surprising seeing that it is a relatively compact vehicle)Other than that, it does what it says it should do.Not overly impressed."
4,NICE ITEM...,"BAUGHT AT GOOD PRICE FROM AMAZON, MY CHILDERN LOVE IT, GOOD PRODUCT BUTSOMETIME STICKING NOT PROPERLY BUT OVERALL GOOD..."
4,Terrific! A buoyant journey,"My heart often sinks when I read contemporary short stories, if they seem stilted or overwrought; when I read ""Dog Days"" in this book, I had the opposite reaction-- felt lifted, freed. This is good, fresh stuff."
3,Expected Much More,"While I enjoy the young writer's style, I just couldn't connect with many of her stories. She's got an original sense of reality and the absurd, but I just couldn't care about any of her characters. Too bad. She's very talented."
1,Read the first story then throw the book away,"The first story is amazing. Unfortunately, the rest is rather silly. I expected a lot more after reading the reviews here, and I even paid the extra international shipping fee to read it since I couldn't find it at my local library.Budnitz has a good style, but fiction is not her forte. Perhaps a career in journalism is in the making?"
2,Annoying,"I don't understand the hype. The stories are all pretty annoying. I guess if you are into boring white middle class life, you might get some kicks out of this book.I spent 20 bucks after reading the review in Time. Sadly enough, I should have bought it at amazon, where I would have wasted only 14 bucks.Ms. Budnitz has a very nice writing style. It is too bad that she wastes it on such banal New Yorker, Harvard creative writing seminar 101 type fare."
1,Didn't do it for me,"The author writes well, but the stories are just a little too absurd to be interesting. The first story is quite good, but the rest become quite boring very quickly. I think the writers talents would be better suited for a much longer work where she can develop the stories a bit further."
2,Libre Fans Beware - Poor Sound,"This music is beyond reproach, but the sound quality of this CD is so bad that I find it unlistenable. I often see copies of this CD in the used bins, and am left to assume others feel the same."
3,Good draw art,"I love these books because Riverstone surprise us with his particular style, it is fantasy genre, not good to have a real idea about the biblic history about Juda."
4,lovely,Yes. The Talgorn version has the End Title which is exactly that used by Lionel Newman for the TV series main title. The orchestration and arrangement is the same. How did I guess? The original TV version appears as item 29 on the TVT Records Television Greatest Hits Vol. 5.
1,Peyton Place,This version is a disaster. My expectations were dashed to pieces..No life. No emotion..An elevater rendition. .It is a joy that I have original (vinal) recording which is a near masterpiece in movie music.
3,"Mildly entertaining, highly unlikely story","THE MANHATTAN HUNT CLUB is worthy of a sunny summer read when you don't want to have to think about anything past cookie-cutter characters and implausible plotlines. I very much enjoyed the premise of this book -- an elite group of urban hunters preying on the homeless living in the tunnels beneath Manhattan -- but COME ON. The coincidences in this book are unreal. For these top-end people to happen to come together to form this hunt club, for the homeless to pull together to allow hunting of their own, for the resourceless Jeff Converse to find his way through the maze of tunnels that even the hunters with their infrared goggles find nearly impassable, and for his family to pretend to be homeless and to walk the subway tunnels to find him . . . arrgh!"
3,are you afraid of the dark?,"I love John Saul and have read everyone of his books but this onewas not like all the rest.It takes place under the streets in total darkness with rats &slime. Two men are being hunted by killers who have guns, lights & know where they are going and how to get out when they want.The two men have one flashlight without extra batteries. If you don't like the idea of this happening to you this will not be a book to read. It is very realistic because John is such a wonderful author. I had to keep putting it down because it was so real.I do have to say it was not my favorite John Saul book but in parts is was very scary. If you wouldn't mind being trapped in pitch black darkness with big rats you will really like this book. It is still JOHN SAUL."
2,Mahatten Hunt Club,"While the plot was terrific, and the story itself, very readable, the fact that the main characters, all found the correct person to relate to ,in the tunnels,(that we were told were teaming with thousands of homeless people,) was so improbable it spoiled the book for me."
4,"Entertaining, fast read","I'd never read John Saul before, and this plot intruiged me because I love NY. From page one, I loved the way it moved, intricately well crafted with well-defined characters.My only gripe, ( as a writer ) was at the climax, when Jeff is found by his father and girlfriend, there's no pleasure in the reunion. Almost like those pages of the manuscript got lost or something! John didn't show us the emotional connection after such trauma, in his characters! A serious blunder!That aside, I'd still reccomend it. And somebody should be making a movie out of it. It's got all the elements of a big screen thriller!Way to go, John!"
3,An enjoyable read.,"What I liked most about this book was its creation and description of a world beneath the streets of New York City. Central to the plot is a community of New York City homeless folks, who, despite being long discarded by society, have a compelling existence, an intricate network of relationships, and a hierarchy. Quite interesting and affecting.A good read, especially if you're a fan of Saul."
5,John Saul Has Gone To New Depths,"In ""The Manhattan Hunt Club,"" John Saul has gone into new territory both with the geographic setting of the novel and his literary reach. MHC will attract and inspire new fans because of its well told mystery appeal and it's almost cinema-like action and characters.This compelling book explores the life under New York City in the tunnels, air ducts, subways and crevices that are the residences of thousands of homeless in New York City.MHC brings home a strong social message that the much heralded triumph over homeless people has literally been pushed underground. Mayor Rudy ""Combover"" Guliani cannot be pleased at the flurry of media attention MHC is likely to inspire underneath his backyard.Any Saul fan will cherish this tale, yet this is a perfect place to start for those who have never been taken on one of Saul's amazing rides."
2,Not His Best by a Long Shot,"I like some of John Saul's work, but I thought THE MANHATTAN HUNT CLUB was a pretty mediocre effort.The concept of this novel (people living in the tunnels underneath the New York Subway) is potentially interesting, but Saul invests little effort in creating believable characters or a realistic plot. In particular, I found the identity of the villains to be ridiculous. The overall silliness of this book made it hard for me to enjoy.In short, THE MANHATTAN HUNT CLUB is pretty lackluster. My advice is to try some of Saul's better known work, such as SUFFER THE CHILDREN or THE GOD PROJECT. Those novels are more exciting, and have much stronger plots and characters."
2,Audiobook specific comments,"If, like me, you appreciate a great reading of a great book as you drive to and from work or pass time on a trip, stay away from the Brilliance Audio version of this book, read by David Daoust. To quote Simon Cowell, ""It is a complete and utter mess!"" The storyline itself is ""okay"", but Daoust's reading is horrific! The phrasing is all wrong, there is no emotion, the characterized voices are just plain STUPID, and it all seems as if Mr Daoust is reading the book for the first time as he commits it to tape! Unbelievable that an author would allow the marketing of such a terrible reading of his material. Obviously, Mr Saul doesn't care. If he did, he would have every copy of this recording yanked off of the market."
4,The Manhattan Hunt Club,A big departure for John Saul. Book starts a little slow but once we are introduced to the Manhattan Hunt Club things really start to take off. No monsters and no creepy old houses this time around. Some of his best characters.
2,Jean-Claude Van Damme was more convincing,"You know, I like these storylines much better when they were movies!I betrayed my long standing rule of John Saul only in emergency, on the basis of some good reviews. Unfortunately, what I found was the illbegotten offspring of a half way decent Jean-Claude Van Damme movie (hard target) and the sublime Silence of the Lambs.The storyline was not original, the characters were pat and cliched, the writing made my teeth squeak. Unless you are a solid John Saul Fan - avoid this."
3,Fascinating premise but too many coincidences,"The premise of the story is fantastic and pulls you right in - the idea of a society of elites that hunt criminals in the mysterious underground tunnels of Manhattan pulls you right into this book. The pages fly by as the mystery builds and the hunt begins - but then the coincidences begin. Saul has the characters meeting each other all over New York again and again in a series of extremely unlikely coincidences. Having lived in NYC for years, I found it hard to believe that his characters could keep meeting up randomly like that. Other than that, a really good piece of entertainment."
2,A Lesser Version of a Popular Theme,"I read this book when it first came out. While I am generally a fan of John Saul's-- I realize he's no Shakespeare, but I read everything he releases-- I was least impressed with this novel. While it was well-written, I felt the plot too closely mirrored other, older, BETTER works of a similar theme, not the least of which being ""The Running Man"" by horror master Stephen King. While setting the work underground adds a dimension of clausterphobia to the book, I didn't believe Saul added anything to a frequently-visited plotline."
3,Nicole,"she now gose by her whole name Nicole Wray and has a new song called ""If I Were Your Girlfriend"" she is now on Def Jam"
5,oldie but goodie,"Love Her, She is so underatted to me and i would love for her to come back, this was my favorite cd from her"
4,i dont know much,"I dont know much about this artist but i do know that she did record a 2nd album called ""electric blue"" but it never released although you can find them off the internet.. She is now working on an album called ""Love Child"" suppose to be out in the summer. but theres suppose to be a mix tape released before the album."
1,Terrible Purchase,I have ordered from amazon many times before but NEVER have I had such bad merchandise sent to me. The package came wrapped up very nice but once I opened the CD case I was horrified. The CD was dirty with who knows what!!! I turned the CD over and it was totally scratched up and broken in the middle. THERE WAS NO WAY IT HAPPENNED DURING SHIPPING. Five of the songs on the CD wouldnt even play at all when I tried it.
4,Good for son's bday party,"There are not many superhero sound tracks out there, so this was good for my 4 year old's Superman party!"
4,My five year old loves it!,"We bought this CD for my son's 5th Superhero birthday party. We weren't disappointed at all. The songs sound great and my son and his friends recognized most of the songs. Even after the party, my son enjoys listening to the songs while he plays in his room. The quality of the songs is a 4 out of 5!"
5,No better book on Thai cooking than this!,"I travel to Thailand EVERY year and have ached to find a REAL book on authentic Thai cooking. My son is Thai and he also RAVES about this book. In addition to some sophisticated recipes, it also has recipes for some street vendor food that I have not been able to find anywhere. (The recipe for Moo Yang is great.) If you want one comprehensive book on Thai cooking, this is it"
5,Awesome Thai cookbook,"This book is great. The first dish I made (Ginger Chicken - p133) was simple to prepare, and tasted wonderful, with those subtle, yet distinctive Thai flavours that I have come to adore.The only drawback is its physical size - unless you have a Heap of kitchen bench space, the book will need to be placed a good distance away to avoid the inevitable splatters..."
5,"A Breathtaking, Beautiful Pictorial with Brilliant Dishes","I bought this book for my husband because I was traveling a lot, he loved Thai food and he needed to learn to cook. Little did I know what a gorgeous book it would be. My husband, who has lived in Thailand, tells me the recipes are authentic and easy to prepare (if you find fresh ingredients). He found this ""cookbook"" so yummy that he left me and opened a Thai restaurant in Australia. BUY THIS BOOK. . . BUT KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF!!!!!"
4,Thai cookbook,"After owning this book for a while I wanted to provide an update. LOVE this book! It has become one of my favorites and my family makes requests all the time. My new sister-in-law is Thai and her parents came for a visit, they speak almost no English. I made a couple of the dishes from the book and they were a bit nervious but appeared shocked when they tasted the food. Said that it was VERY authentic and they wouldn't have believed I made it from scratch if they hadn't seen it. Very inspiring book and if you have an Asian market nearby you are in for a real treat.===============This book is beautiful, the photos are pleasing and I like the fact they give you the Thai name as well as the English translation. The recipes are not too complicated and after trying out a number of them they are incredibly favorful and simiple to make."
5,Excellent Book!!,"This is an excellent book. Everything I have tried has been fantastic. It has wonderful pictures as well. In fact, the fact that the pictures are so wonderful may lead some to believe that it is really a coffee table book -- that is, until they try the recipes. A definite must for anyone who loves Thai food!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Beautiful to look at, decent recipes","This isn't my favorite Thai cookbook for recipes. There are several good recipes, and many that are not terribly authentic. But, if you love a cookbook with outstanding pictures, this is a wonderful book. There are so many terrific pictures of places I visited in Thailand, I had to get the book."
1,"Beautiful book, stupid cookbook format","I purchased this book based on the 31 5 star reviews. After a trip to Thailand, I wanted to learn to cook the food. I am disappointed. The format is TOO BIG 10x14""to be practical as a cookbook. Also the recipes are short on techniques--just the ingredients and basic cooking instructions. I'm donating this book to Goodwill and purchasing a real Thai cookbook."
3,"Good writen, but not extraordinary ...","This book was fun to read, good written, nice pictures and neither pornographic nor boring. Points of critizism: The sexual preferences described weren`t so ""incredibly strange"". Ponyriding, rubber fetish, mud and food games, fat, food and boot fetish, clinical and bondage are exactly the ways I imagined bizarre sex to be, so there was really no surprise. And then there is not too much about MS, animal, excrement, necrophilia, stuff that`s not so well known ... Personally I would have enjoyed to read a little bit about techniques and tricks. Overall, the title was misleading, but the book was ok."
1,Deviant Desires-Incredibly Strange Sex,"yawn...i was looking for a little erotic stimulation to spice up my sex life and after perusing this book my boyfriend and I could hardly keep from laughing. It's a book of true fetishes, nothing erotic unless you fall into the small percentage of the population that gets off on, dressing up as a pony, furies, blown-up pictures of women transposed onto fake skyscapes, women over 400 lbs., or having unappetizing food poured over your head and body. I realize that to some folks, the above are exactly the ticket to ecstasy but unfortunately I was mislead by the title and was hoping for a little bondage or dress-up games."
4,Not quite what I was expecting... but great overall.,"I have been wanting this book for quite some time now. I must say, I was rather disappointed when I received it. I picked up the book and I flipped through the pages to get a feel of it. I was shocked to see not one color photograph illustrating the various sexual deviances. However, the book is highly informative. One other gripe I may have about the book is that the chapter on ponyplay is much too long. I would have preferred a shorter chapter on this topic and the introduction of a new topic instead. The chapter on sploshing was great."
3,Good Rainy Day Reading,"I picked this up from the discount rack at my favorite book store and it stayed on my bookshelf for a long time before I thought about reading it. This is a pretty short book - you can probably read it in a day if you really get into it. I thought it was a really good story. This is not your run-of-the mill relationship story as it delved into the interaction between mother/daughter, father/daughter, and neighbor/neighbor. It was a good change of pace from what I usually read. I'd recommend this one for purchase. It's a keeper."
2,Daevid Allen Trio - 'Live 1963' (Voiceprint),"Recorded sometime in 1963 at the famed Marquee Club in London. Despite the artist name on this CD, the Daevid Allen Trio, it was actually a very early formation of the Soft Machine. Pretty much for the true die-hards and completists. Sound quality isn't very good, but semi-listenable IF you take the time (like I did). Cuts here I thought were so-so include ""Love Is A Careless Sea"" and their epic - the ten minute folk-ish ""Dear Old Benny Is A-Turning In His Grave"". For the record, I've heard better sounding bootlegs. Enter at your own risk."
2,learning,it's got a lot to teach kids but i believe it's not exciting enough to make kids want to sit down and enjoy or learn from it for long.
5,Hitting him hard,I got the Cash Kola cd and if you don't get this you can't likereal music. Because the cd is (SLAAMMIINNGG!!!). That's the wayto keep D.E.T on the map. Let them know your TOO HOT for tv.
4,Single serving platter,"Sango stoneware has been great for us for everyday use. Good feel with smooth surfaces including the bottom so it doesn't scratch. I've built up a whole collection of Sango Gold Dust after seeing it at Bed Bath and Beyond. Pick up items on sale, no need to pay regular price.Keep in mind this item is one serving platter. I mistakenly thought it was going to be a set of square dinner plates. This item was delivered shattered probably due to very rough handling in shipping, so be sure to check the product shortly after delivery."
2,temporary solution,"I was a little disappointed in this product. It arrived with wrinkles already in it that I thought would come out when applied, but did not. I purchased two (2)rolls, and they were both the same. I wouldn't suggest buying this product unless it is going to be in a closet, I am using as a temporary shield on my backsplash until my tile is installed. It's ashame it doesn't come as smooth and attractive as photo."
3,Barely meets expectations,"I purchased this contact paper to place on 1"" aluminum tubing for flag poles. The silver does look good, but this contact paper DOES NOT hold up as well as expected.I have used many different types of contact paper for this use , but this product does not seem to stick as well as others I have used in the past. As a result, the contact paper comes loose from the tubing at the seams.If I wasn't trying to get a metallic look, I would have chosen a different product."
2,Wrong dimensions,"The contact paper was fine, but not as advertised. Spec says it is 18"" x 9' long, but when we got it, it was only 6' long. We didn't have time to return it, but we were not happy to discover that we were short changed."
1,it is paper,"this product is really contact paper - shelf liner, not the type of product used to cover appliances. Don't be fooled."
5,Fantastic Quartet sound,"Just love the CD, like the good old gospel but with a modern twist. I've watched them on the Gaither Gospel hour and they bring a fresh look to quartet music. They have humor and such a great blend of voices. I'm looking forward to seeing them live."
1,Ernie Haase & Signature Sound,"Very disappointing. Not at all consistent with the usual quality of SSQ. There is only one song that somewhat redeems the album ""Forgiven Again"".Ernie and SSQ, please regroup your songs for future recording.I would be skeptical of buying another SSQ album"
5,still listening..,"..bought it in 2000 or 2001, indeed a good sleeping cd : ) but, what really kicked me is that although it's a various artists compilation, it sounded like a solid creation from one artist (to my thinking).i'd also like to notice how multilayered the music/sound is.When your are not sleepy, dim the lights, close your eyes and let the sound in - amaizingly it'll fill up your head with pure space, not chores ; )"
4,Very good sleep music,"This is great background ambient music and exceptional sleep music. There is nothing very exciting or unusual from Steve Roach, just more of the same standard fare done by different artists whom are not yet on the level of Steve."
2,Could do More,"I like the individual chapters in this book that explain arguments in very clear ways. What I don't like are the choices of readings in the back. What's difficult is that so many of these are news articles or editorial-like texts that are extremely difficult to dig as deep as I'd like to do in my course. Students seem to find this book confusing in organization as well. There are some good things - a few of the visual texts are quite intriguing and I rely on them a lot for class discussion, but I often have to supplement reading material for students."
5,Awesome,My son has learned so much by watching these videos. The characters and story that accompany the learning are so entertaining that he wants to watch them over and over. It teaches the types of phonics lessons that most adults take for granted and would never think to explain to a child.
5,Excellent Series,"We own four DVDs in this series: Math Circus, Code Word Caper, The Letter Factory, and the Talking Words Factory. We bought them when our boys were ages five and three. We've had them for about a year now, and the boys still enjoy them. We get a lot more use out of them than the Leap Pads, which our kids never really got into. Our younger boy is in speech therapy, and seeing these DVDs has improved his articulation of letters. I love that he requests to watch these. I will hear him sounding out each letter along with the Frog, and know he's developing skills. Our older son has picked up on how to build words and spell with this series. It explains how phonics work, and in a simple-to-understand way. We found all of the DVDs in this series exceptionally educational, and see tangible results from the children watching them. I can't say that about any other toy we own."
5,Biomagnetic,When I started using magnetics in my shoes the effect was very good. I recommend them. They work if used daily.
1,Northshore disposable underpads,It was smaller than I expected to be. The description should say for adult sized or child size. I wonder if I could return after opening the package.?
5,a must for a new baby,"Small chux pads are a must for a baby. We use them on top of the changing pad so we don't have to wash the cover every time there is an accident. We also carry them in the diaper bag so any couch (or lap) can be turned into a changing pad.The second time around, I ordered similar pads from another seller because I assumed they'd be the same and those were a little cheaper. Turns out, they are a little different. We like this brand better because it's softer and seems a little more absorbent. Not a huge difference though, sort of like a preference in paper towels - at the end they all do the job.Update: Now that our little one is a year old, we don't go through these pads quite as fast. They are still a must on our changing table. Our baby is very squirmy and sometimes it's hard to keep all the mess inside the diaper. If it wasn't for these pads, we'd have to have several changing pad covers and wash they much more frequently."
3,Good for a temporary solution,"Our little boy is just about at the age where he's dry all night, but not quite there yet. We have some waterproof pads we wash, but I wash frequently, so sometimes I'd find myself w/o a cloth pad when it was bedtime.I bought the Chux pads just for the times we didn't have a cloth pad available. They'll also come in handy for vacation - don't want wet hotel beds!The Chux work well enough in the catching wetness department, but do tend to slide around or bunch up. Given the choice, I'll always choose our cloth pads, but in a pinch these are fine."
2,not the best product,This item was purchased for my parent to line her in-home hospital bed. bThe item was not fully waterproof and caused more trouble as her bedding had to be changed as a result of the pads inefficiency. The major problem was that the lining was not 100% plastic/waterproof to hold fluid. It was more of a thick paper product that eventually absorbed the fluid. I would not recommend this item for the purpose of lining a bed.
5,Used as a car seat liner,We use this as a car seat liner during potty training. I looked for something small enough to fit under my child and not effect how I buckle my child in. Now I don't have to wash the car seat cover after each accident.
3,They work,"They did what I needed them to do (use them on my changing table) but they were pretty thin, got caught in the diaper tabs a lot and were staticky."
1,For people who have $$$ to burn,"For the rich, and uneducated person who believes that somehow Monster cable has magic wires, and therefore will pay 4 times the amount that they should cost! Don't waste your $$$."
3,piraka are wastes of money,"vezok. the beast.a very big marketing ego,but don't be fooled. I have all the piraka, and vezok is the best, but the piraka are only for:light up eyes, rubber spine, and white glow-in-the-dark teeth/head. go and buy a bionicle bohrok. they fold into balls. or a bionicle barraki or mahri. this review runs the same for all the piraka."
4,Product discription,"Beware Vezok's fury!Nasty and vicious, Vezok's fury is always on the verge of exploding. In battle, he relies on a harpoon that pulls him through the water and a buzzsaw that hurls water daggers. His powerful impact vision and ability to absorb the powers of his enemies makes him a devastating opponent.Includes zamor spheres and launcher!Piraka eyes light up and teeth glow in the dark!"
5,"Buy Big, Big World, and you'll be happy!","I have bought several of the Big, Big World DVD's, and my granddaughter absolutely loves them. She is one year old and sits to watch the DVD with a big smile on her face. She get excited during all the music portions of the show and dances. These DVDs are the best purchase I have made so far as a new grandmother! I would absolutely recommend purchasing them. I'm going for the whole collection, and will purchase some for gifts. I want to share them with everyone!"
4,works well,i replaced multiple 2 and 4 way splitters with this single one. picture quality across the tvs (i actually use all 8 outputs) is now slightly better. good price as well.
1,Don't buy the MP3s!,"Something very damaging happened in the production of the MP3s for this album. The last track seems to have somehow been replicated in many of the other tracks, regardless of their titles. Note that many of the tracks have the same length, 3:29; what are the odds of that in a correct album? This means that you will get to hear the closing chorus and lots of applause many times if you have the patience to listen to the whole album. Note that this strange defect also appears in the album on E-Music.com! That's where I first noticed it. The CDs, judging by the several reviews, are not afflicted by this defect."
5,Cure for Arthritis,This is a great book that really helped me with my arthritis.If you are in pain this book will help get you out of pain.Great stories about this unusual mineral.Carol RN
3,Minerals,This book was easy to read and suggests that supplements of this special mineral combination will stop cartilage loss and inflammation naturally. It tells all about this unusual discovery of a mineral deposit in the High Sierras and how it was brought to the market. It also cites a number of scientific studies backing up its validity. Actually it seemed to me like a commercial for SierraSil. -- Val Lull
3,half-rating for a half-great book,"If you happen to find this book torn in half in a used book shop, then buy only the first half. There you will find brilliant Muldoon. If you reaqd just that, you'll think he's the greatest Irish poet ever (or at least among the top three). I wish I could say the same for the last half."
4,Good tie for price,"The tie came in exactly as described with no notable defects. Although it is impressive at a distance or upon first sight, it is not crafted to precision - I noticed the triangular ends are not exactly perfect. Despite this, I like this tie a lot and will definitely use it to attend a black tie event since nobody will really be scrutinizing my tie. It is trendy, feels nice and commensurate with the price."
5,Top Tier,"Great product, arrived PROMPTLY and in condition as described. Trendy yet elegantly classic. Rarely do I write review for purchased item but for the price you'll pay for this, it is well worth the money. Do yourself a favor and pull the buy trigger, believe me, you will not be dissapointed."
4,"Stunning. Frightening, Very complete","Apart from a slight blur in Rowells vision where Greenpeace is concerned and the fact that he consideres the world, global examples notwithstanding, still to be mostly America, a frightening, stunning and utterly mesmerising book. Halfway through the reader has to take all the implications into account and then apply them to similar cases in one's own surrounding. Very accurately, it illustrates that obviously old tactics of repression do not work anymore, having been recognised to often for what they are, so new strategies are called for to hold us down where the enviroment is concerned. This book is a must for anyone interested in enviromentalism. For me, environmental journalist in the Netherlands,a small, very regulated country with a sickening economic drive, an oasis of recognition. compliments."
4,banner,this banner is everything that I asked however I did not use it. I ordered a few extra things and they had Happy Birthday on it as well.
2,We prefer Leap Frog series,"This second volume is certainly superior in video quality to the first volume, and it is educational. However, we are disturbed by the prolonged boxing scene between two children where spectators cheer for physical (not a linguistic allegory) hitting abilities, and by the prominent use of the exclamation ""shut up!"" We find that the Leap Frog series provides similarly good education, more captivating entertainment, and no troubling content."
1,Dated methods; poor quality; deceptive marketing,"The 2005 release date is indicative of the product's new titling and packaging only. The children pictured on the box are not featured in the video. The video appears to have been made in the 70's or 80's at best. Sound is muffled. Phonics teaching methods have come a long way since this. The instructor pronounces letters ""M-uh"", ""L-uh"", etc. When she makes a mistake, she corrects herself and goes on. There are no retakes. At one point, her marker doesn't work and she said to herself, ""I hope your marker doesn't mess up like mine."" Who was she talking to? I wish I had known about the original production date when I made this purchase. I feel deceived.I highly recommend Rock-N-Learn Phonics. It is complete (I can't find a phonics skill that is not covered), and it is captivating, at least to my child."
1,Made in 1991 but looks like 1971,"Don't be fooled by other reviews. This video is a poor copy of a VHS into DVD. The picture quality and sounds is terrible. The original recording is from 1991, but the poor quality makes it look like it's from 1971. The teaching can not keep my son's attention for more than a few minutes - and he loves to watch these kind of videos. Don't buy this recycled junk."
4,Learn to Read with Phonics-Short & Long Vowels,"The cute little girl on the front is no where on the video. The female instructor uses a dry erase board to write word families. She sounds out the words as she spells them then repeats the word after writing it. There is an excellent vignette at the end of the DVD in which the dialogue is written at the bottom of the screen. It includes phonetic words with the short vowels. There are no cartoon characters or cute songs or graphics, but it does teach what it claims in the title. It is a great ""substitute teacher"" for me when I am temporarily busy. Then I reinforce the lesson without the DVD. Great purchase."
1,not current with todays children,This video was made a long time ago. It is not current with today's busy kids!!! Much better video's on the market for helping your child learn how to read!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A Happier Pumpkins,"Billy Corgan doesn't dissapoint his aged, but strong, fanbase with Zwan's debut disc. Every song has a definite reminiscient value of Gish/Siamese Dream style pumpkins.There is one difference however, this isn't the depressed and hateful Corgan that we used to know. The one reason I didn't give this album a 5 out of 5, is the happiness factor of the music. It is all very good, but I think most pumpkins fans miss the sadness and anger of older pumpkins songs like ""today"" and ""bullet with butterfly wings"".This album still remains solid gold, however, with brilliant tracks like ""Honestly"", ""Heartsong"", and ""Lyric"". The slow-paced but pretty ""Of a broken heart"" is a beautiful piece of work also. In my opinion, however, the standout track of the album is ""Yeah"". Overall, its Billy Corgan at his height of brilliance, just not as [ticked] off as before."
4,Honestly Zwan,"""Honestly"" the first single to be lifted off the album defines this album. I think it sounds great My person favorite are ""Lyric"" and ""Honestly"". Billy whateva you've been doin it shows that this isnt another smashing pumpkins and fans of them wont be let down.This Cd is alot of melodic more then heavy metal. This new line up is one not to be wreckend with. But I advise sample the album anyway possible b4 buying it."
4,did he change?,"although he's not credited as playing on the album, the voice gives billy away. does this matter? not in the least. the album's first and second songs are weak but after that, there are no missteps..."
5,Incredible,"This CD is excellent. If you are lonely for new music that resembles the Pumpkins older tunes then this is for you. It combines Pumpkins sounding songs (with the help of Billy)and mixes a dreamy essence in with the songs. I was blown away by the song ""Ride a Black Swan"" with it's raw guitar riffs. I would give this a 12 instead of a 5 if I could."
5,Joy! Joy! Joy!,I am a huge fan of Billy Corgan. I loved the Smashing Pumpkins and was destroyed when they ended the band. I just bought this CD on lunch and listened to the whole thing. I was very pleased with the songs. I have heard some of the live versions of the Zwan songs and was very excited to hear how the studio versions would sound. I don't know much about his new band mates except for Jimmy of course. I can say that Zwan has a very fresh sound and I hope they are around for a while. Thank you Billy Corgan for your music it has inspired many wonderful paintings over the years.
5,Zwan rocks,"The album is much better than I had expected, and although there are some songs I am not as crazy about, the DVD is absolutely worth the extra [money]. It's 40 minutes long, and features some REALLY great music NOT on the Cd. Definately worth the money; if you liked the Pumpkins, you'll like this CD, but it is very different, so don't think it's Mellon Collie 3. I can't say too much about it, and it's still growing on me."
5,Incredible,"If you are lonely for new Pumpkins sounding music, then this cd is for you. Many of the songs sound like the old Smashing Pumpkins but with a new twist of a dreamy sound. ""Ride a Black Swan"" is an incredible song and should be a hit very soon. If you are looking for really good tunes then run out and get this cd ASAP."
4,Yay!,"First reviewer? Wow! Oh well, onto business... This cd is grrrrrrreat! Just like Tony the Tiger :) I'm quite pleased at what I am hearing of this cd already and I've had it less than 24 hours now. The songs are growing on me quite well. This team assembled by Billy Corgan works really well together. I love Paz's backup vocals and the 3 guitars work really, really well together. Of course Jimmy is great on drums as usual. It wasn't what I was expecting, though. I was expecting something dark and dreamy and moody all rolled up into something deep and compelling. I got exactly the opposite yet I am not disappointed by this. Most of the songs found on this disk are bright, fairly cheery and just good rock music. There are a few slower, sad songs such as Of a Broken Heart, but most of it is mid-tempo rock and roll. I don't really know what else to say except that I see this cd in my player for a long time to come."
5,This is a Great Album,"After a mere decade and the Smashing Pumpkins calling it quits in 2001, Singer Billy Corgan remerges with a great new band and release of the album ""Mary Star of the Sea"". The other members that he got together with also have had their own successes, like guitarist David Pajo (ex-Slint, Tortoise), guitarist/vocalist Matt Sweeney (Chavez) and bassist/vocalist Paz Lenchantin ( A Perfect Circle). It features the fourteen minute epic (in the typical Smashing Pumpkins vein) titled ""Jesus,I/Mary Star Of The Sea"" a somewhat overblown epic.With their three guitar line-up it's not surprising that the songs on Mary Star of the Sea have a Big guitar sound, but unlike Corgan's previous releases he sounds more a peace with himself. Songs like ""Honesty"", ""Settle Down"", ""El Sol"" get better and better the more you listen to them. The song ""Come With Me"" ends the album in an anti-climatic manner but the overall vibe of the album is that it is a great album."
2,(...),"They sold us Honestly as a single because it sounds like Smashing Pumpkins and we'd all go OOOO and buy the disc, but then you listen to it and realize nothing else on the cd sounds like Honestly and the rest of it is in fact just (...). Booooring. Don't bother... go listen to your old SP discs instead."
2,Not what I expected.,"While I was among the SP fans that were shocked at the release of MACHINA, and even moreso when the band called it quits soon after, I didn't give up hope. I had faith in this new project called ZWAN. However, Mary Star of the Sea did little to soothe my little heart.With this project, Billy Corgan seems to be attempting to claim the radio mainstream with songs that are nothing but faint echoes of what the Smashing Pumpkins were at their best. Despite Billy's hallmark vocals, the album, overall, lacks fire and heart. You'll catch wisps of old school Pumpkins sound, it's distorted and somewhat dulled...not at all what I expected from this master songwriter.I'm disappointed, and the album will probably collect dust somewhere in my collection."
2,Pisces Iscariot 2?,"How utterly disapointing. This record sounds like a SMASHING PUMPKINS B-sides retread. I was pretty excited about this project when I heard that Matt Sweeny of the incredible (although short-lived) band CHAVEZ and Paz Lenchantin of A PERFECT CIRCLE were involved, too bad the whole thing sounds like a Billy Corgan solo album. This disc isn't a complete mess, Jimmy Chamberlain's drumming is always a treat and all involved are great artists. The biggest problem is Corgan, who has yet to record anything superior to SIAMESE DREAM, which would be an even better record if everything he's done since didn't sound the same. A very plain disc that goes just beyond boring. Shame."
2,ZWHAT????,"Okay, sadly enough, grunge IS dead. Hell yeah, it was short lived, but it spawned some incredible bands and if the Smashing Pumpkins weren't a good enough alternative rock band for Billy Corgan to exist in, then i say let it go cause nothing will ever top their ultimate album: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. The new stuff is similar given that the man's voice cannot be mistaken for anyone else, which is what made the pumpkins so unique and great, i think. Fans will like it for that, but the feel is different. I would've rather corgan to have never sang again without his true bandmates than this. Maybe i'm just bitter. Mayonnaise."
4,Yeah!,"Face it...99% of you are looking at this album cause you loved The Smashing Pumpkins and Billy Corgan. Yes it may be an all star cast of performers, but Corgan is the man which makes this tick. The cd is full of the touches left on all of Corgan's music. Some of the songs are great. Some are just good. Yes, track 13 is incredibly long and tedious, but it isn't entirely a bad song. I love the slower ""Desire""...my favorite on the album. The other standouts are the quicker paced ""Settle Down"", the poppy ""El Sol"", the beautiful sadness in ""Of A Broken Heart"", the harmonica filled ""Come With Me"", and of course the new single ""Honestly"". I really like when Paz (the female bassist) sings along with Corgan on many of the tracks. It creates a nice vocal balance, not heard with the pumpkins. If you liked the Pumpkins...definately buy this cd. If you like good music and not most of the stuff you hear on MTV and modern rock radio...buy this cd."
5,great stuff!,"Buy this now! A surely must have for all Smashing Pumpkins fans! New sound, new Billy Corgan's style - amazing vocals - and Jimmy Chamberlain on drums is superb! - the whole new band - ZWAN!"
5,AMAZING!!,"I'm not as analytical I'd like to be but let me just mention that this is a great album. Billy has always been one to exceed my expectations and beat the adversary criticism that he's slapped with, and this record is yet another bold and at the same time, honest statement. Every song seems to sink in deeper with every listen and you just have to love it. Every song is a big favorite of mine and it would be harsh to point out a single one so I won't. Any tSP fan will love this album and if you like good music you will too."
2,*yawn*,"Well, the smashing pumpkins were indeed one of the great rock bands of the 90s. Unfortunately they kept growing steadily worse ever since Mellon Collie, hitting their ultimate low at Machina:the machines of god.Luckily, this album doesnt sound like the oh-so-plastic Machina, and it does indeed appear that Billy has returned a bit to his roots, what he does best..It all starts out pretty promising, but as I was listening to this album I found myself extremely bored. Where the heck are the catchy hooks?Despite Billy`s characteristic guitar strummings and Chamberlains heavy...drumming, this somehow just seems WRONG.Now, this is by no means a BAD album. It`s just oh so mediocre.I am sure you hardcore Corgan-worshippers out there will want to pick this up, but for the rest of us this is just another album that will get dusty on our CD-rack."
3,meh.,"I bought this CD because I thought Honestly was a decent song and I very much enjoyed the Pumpkins. If you want the Pumpkins from this CD, too bad. It wasnt a very great CD, and the DVD is only worth buying if you dont mind watching an hour of very spooky footage. If you ask me, msots is just billy's mid-life crisis CD. Hopefully any future recordings by Zwan will be..better. Dont get me wrong,though. I would buy the CD again if i had to, but it just wasnt as good as i had expected. But, I did like the stickers."
5,Satisfied customer,This is a very user friendly book and I have found it very useful for answering my French grammar questions.
1,An orgy of self-pity.,"This combat memoir is amazing. Most young soldiers find themselves disillusioned after their baptism of fire, but return with a new maturity. Not so George Lince. This veteran has merely catalogued a vast array of bitches, gripes and moans about his WWII experiences: his buddies were dishonest and lazy, his gear was antiquated and, yes, the food was terrible. Even worse, his father was unsympathetic and his girlfriend left him. This is not a case of combat angst; this is common whining, a display of self-pity carefully nurtured for fifty years. Even worse, the book is padded with long passages from other (and better) books. Save your money."
5,Strongly Recommended,"This is a wonderful book for adult students. I have taken piano lessons on and off for nearly 40 years. Because every teacher seems to use different material, I've been exposed to most of the different teaching series. Alfred's series has songs that are familiar, interesting, and varied, and the next song was always at just the right level. I felt a terrific sense of accomplishment when I finished the book."
4,great intermediate song selection,one of the best instructional books I have used. definitely geared towards the adult student. Good combination of music theory and well-known song selection.
4,Very Good,"This version of Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course is very good, but I think that the Adult All-In-One Course: Lesson-Theory-Technic level 2 would be a better, more up-to-date choice."
4,Fun selection of songs,I have enjoyed learning the songs in this book. The songs are familiar and it makes it easier to play if you know the melody. I am teaching myself and it takes me longer. The songs get progressively harder and it's been fun playing them. If a CD is available with the book it would be worth getting to accompany it.
2,Beware! You need to buy additional books,"While this is a long-standing instructional series, something of which the novice should be aware: When you purchase this book, you should also be aware that you will have to purchase several other books/instructional materials to correlate with this book. For example, I have covered the first 7 pages of the book and am now told that I am ready for two additional books in the series. These books need to be purchased separately and are not, as of this writing, available on Amazon. So, I need to purchase these books from another site. Even though I live in a major city (Chicago), these companion volumes are not readily available."
3,Basic Piano 2,"The Alfred books are pretty good. I bought 2 of these one for me and one for a friend. I still need to use book 1. Book 2 scares me away. My friend say books 2 is outstanding. If you play better than I do, buy this book."
1,Not good for me!,"I find you must of have the audio part with lesson part or this series. I called my local music store where I bought Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course : Lesson Book, Level one and wanted to get the audio part. I called my local music store where I bought the book, the person who spoke to me said they woul other the part and then call at the end of that week. No call. I think without the audio part you have to take lessons from some one. I don't won't to do that yet. One star maybe to much? ."
4,Insightful!,This series of books are layed out in a way that is extremely helpful to me as an adult learning Piano.Thanks
2,This needs to be re-designed,The holes are much too narrow and deep. Rocks cannot be picked up quickly and easily. My son began looking for a replacement game right after receiving this for Christmas. I bought a fantastic version of this game at Target years ago - it's perfect!
4,Great but time consuming,"I ordered this book because I have some favourite clothes that I would love to reproduce, I'm sure we all do :-). The author was very clear in her instructions and the diagrams and pictures were good and easy to follow. Unfortunately the process is very time consuming, and after the reading the book I doubt I will put these techniques into practice.However it's a great book to get if you just can't part with that favourite outfit, and are willing to spend the time to reproduce it."
2,Stiff and Uncomfortable!,"I guess these suspenders do what they're supposed to do, and hold up your pants but, they're torture to wear. The straps below the leather fastener are elastic and have give but, the straps above are made of some sort of rigid material with no give making them hard to slip over the shoulder. The worst problem is the leather fastener. It's thick and stiff and rubs in the middle of your back when you're sitting in a chair or bent over leaning forward. The military should use these on prisoners they want ""to spill their guts""."
3,"Not much there, what's there is pretty good.","In this simple book, best-selling psychology author Biddulph provides rough outlines of a parenting method. The author is opposed to fulltime child care and physical discipline, but presents his opposition in a reasonably even-handed way. The book does present interesting new terms: softlove (tenderness, affection, making sure the child knows you love him) and firmlove (providing limits and consequences). Read ""How to Talk so Children will Listen and Listen so Children Will Talk"" instead."
2,Can I be referred to your referee?,"First, let me say that someone once told me I was so far right and so far left I meet in the back. I really want to be unbiased about this book, neither entirely agreeing or disagreeing with its content. My main concern is the authors sources, I mean have you seen the back of this mother? New York Times??? Washington Post??? In chapter five the author makes incredible claims about US torture employed in Iraq. Maybe it happened, maybe not, I want to know the source sited right(I want to investigate for myself)? no problem, flip to the back of the book, chapter five reference 29, ""readers can contact the author at his email address for the source of anything mentioned in this section"". WHAT? Im not sure this is MLA compliant, you must be wizzing in my tennis shoes, I paid $13.00 for this abuse. I wonder what my college instructors would have done if I did this in one of my research papers. I want to like this book, but I think the sources need more credibility."
4,The Freedom to Disagree is more important than flag waving,"I think this book is right on target - literally. Perhaps a bit righteous and opinionated, but facual. The reader ""from the USA"" quoted below is interesting - Blum's book must be repressed in stores and ejected from schools, thrown in the trash and people like him deported in the name of ""freedom."" This is the kind of moral disconnect responsible for the atrocities Mr. Blum documents. None is more blind than he who will not see..."
1,"Silly Rabbit, Trix are for kids","The previous reviewer has obviously missed something. Facts by pure numbers do not necessarily establish accuracy. Inaccuracies do detract from credibility. To say that the book was 50% accurate is enough to tell me that I need to find another book to use for my research. Almost accurate only counts in darts and horseshoes. If I back check the authors sources and find a single source that does not match, the entire work (as well as the author) is called into question. I may as well do all of the research myself, in which case why do I need this book at all? And if the journalists did not want you to notice that the U.S. government supported X, they simply will not write it. There are enough criticizers of the government within the media. The two are not in league with each other. (I know, I know, that's what they want me to think.) Get real."
1,Intellectually Destructive,"While perusing this moral wasteland of a book, I came to understand with great clarity why America's greatest enemy would want us to read it. It fills the reader's head with notions right out of a Soviet propaganda film. The author believes that if he can stoke your internal fire with the right combination of emotional diatribe, you'll be convinced that America really IS the Great Satan. Then he repeats it several different ways for good measure.Give me a break.There is no redeeming value contained in this utter work of fiction. It's amazing how far someone can go by mingling a few truths with utter nonsense. If the author had just come right out and admitted his feelings about America, no one would have taken him seriously. But he figured out that if he can wrap the big lie in a little truth, the public will swallow it. I mean after all, we're all a bunch of idiots according to this guy.Don't waste your time, money or laughs."
1,not that good,depicting every bad thing going on in the world as a reaction to America's actions.It seems the author is very narrow minded and the book is very subjective.
1,Garbage....,"After reading this book, and checking the facts extensively, I have to say this book is, from a factual standpoint, total garbage. I bought it because I am always open to diverse ideas, but I can't beleive people take this guy seriously! If you are a rabid anti-american who will not listen to hard fact, this book is for you. However, if you are a free-thinking person who refuses to beleive everything you are told, don't waste your time or money!"
4,"Good Book, however.....","If you want to understand America's present position and present ambitions, read Crossing The Rubicon, by Michael C. Ruppert."
2,"Valid Concept, Excellent Idea....very poorly executed.","I was expecting much more from this book than what I got. The author hits upon many valid topics and examples that proves his point but fails miserably to do anything but skim the surface rather than tackle any of them in depth. I felt like I was reading a collection of brief introductions to numerous scandalous acts rather than a book about the actual acts themselves. If you want to read something that details US Government crimes and activities abroad, I would say Save your money and look instead at the numerous ""smaller"" books by Noam Chomsky."
3,Left winger ultimately blames the victims,"I recommend this book because I like to read things that challenge my outlook, my assumptions about the world. The book points out that American policy makers may have made many errors and foolish moves, and Americans should probably debate whether this is the case. That being said, in the end what one ultimately ends up with here is a left winger who blames America for creating its own problems, which in my conclusion is just too simplistic. If you want to read something a bit more meaty and perhaps spicy as well, read Robert Fisk's The Great War for Civilisation. I don't always agree with Fisk (indeed, I often do not), but he presents a more convincing case overall of the folly of Western policy in the Middle East. I cannot imagine that Fisk would receive Osama's blessing, but I can't hold that against Blum either."
5,A VERY EDUCATIONAL READ,"A must read for everyone, 1.27.05 Reviewer: Paul, CA USA) - This book is not just a person's opinion. All claims are substantiated with intricate detail through the sources referenced. Therefore, it is a must read for every American to better understand our foreign policy and the effect it has on world affairs and world reactions. By reading this book, one would understand that if the US is going to truly lead the world through justice and not just pay lip service, then it needs a major overhaul of its policies, both foreign and domestic."
1,DON'T Read just because Bin Laden says so!,"If you are buying this book because Osama Bin Laden said to, stop! Think about this for a minute! If one of the largest threats to America and the world when it comes to terrorism is encouraging you to read a book, how can it be beneficial to YOU?! He is your enemy! Obviously there is a benefit to HIM or else he would not have suggested we read this book. So please! DONT READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE BIN LADEN SAYS SO! Stay away from it and encourage your friends not to be led about by Osama also."
4,Slice of history served warm...,An old work that holds up -- Mayhew's a nonfiction Dickens historian. This seminal work really offers a glimpse into the past and paints how hard the poor had it back then.
1,Can't recomment,"Poor sound quality. On one track, ""All I Ask of You,"" he is out of synch with the backup music. This is one of those recordings I would return for a refund, if I could."
3,Clash Tribute,"Some interesting versions, the only real dissappointment was on ""Should I Stay or Should I go"" This song should have never been performed by a rapper."
2,It is really 5 stars,I'm only writing 2 stars to be put with the two star raterExcellent job hamilton peopleThe other 2 star writer...if it is taking up space then throw it out or try a differant recipe yours could just stink...try the Aunt Jamima *spelling error?* Pancake mix and on the back it says WAFFLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank you for you time dear reader
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"Today I plugged it in, waited for it to preheat, and then watched as it took 45 minutes for three waffles to cook. With the 10 minutes I let it preheat, it was almost an hour to get the waffles to eat."
4,Hamilton Beach Waffle Stick Maker - Not bad,This does a good job. It is small though and requires many cooking cycles if cooking enough for a family. But the price was right! Good to have on hand to have something different in the morning for breakfast.
4,Hamilton Beach Waffle Stix Waffle Maker,Great item. The kids love it. The only down fall is the cleaning up. It is hard to get all the little areas clean. Thats why I gave it a 4 stars.It makes very good waffles.
2,I wasted my money,"This wafflebaker uses too much batter just to fill the two sections,the waffles constantly stuck to the machine even when I oiled it (as suggested in the manual). I even oiled it each time I used it (although its supposed to only need it for the first use). I am constantly scraping stuck, dried waffle batter off of it. It's in my closet now taking up space. Don't buy this one."
3,I wouldn't buy it again,I bought it and used it once. That one time cleanup was a real pain. I wouldn't buy this again.
3,Not my favorite,I am giving mine to Goodwill. Not the best waffles in my families total opinion. Does not cook well enough to make both sides crisp unless you flip it during cooking. Also takes over 7 minutes to cook one batch. I don't really recommend this waffle stick iron.
4,Rolling Walker,This walker has been a life saver! I had surgery on both knees and had trouble getting around. I work in a Kindergarten class and this chair was the perfect thing to help me both in the classroom with a chair at the right height and outside on the playground. The only problem that I have had is the brakes. They tend to come loose so my husband had to make an adjustment. I would recommend this to anyone who needs help getting around.
5,walker,Bought this walker for my mother. It is easy to assemble and looks sturdy. It gave my mother the support she needed when she walked. It helped her posture. She can stand up straight and she said it is comfortable for her to walk with. She walked faster and comfortably with this walker. The walker maneuvers well in all directions and the seat is well padded. I definitely recommend this for someone that needs it.
2,"Not as nice as expected,caused injury!","We purchased this walker for our father.He has a hard time walking for long periods and was using a old style walker for a while. When he got this he liked the idea of wheels and a seat if needed but quickly was injured when the wheel brake on the back gave out and the walker rolled away from him as he was trying to put weight on it.He fell pretty hard and we are now buying a wheelchair from amazon for him.Very disappointed. I Adjusted to brakes as the manual said but even so,with full brake you can turn the wheel on our unit with a little push forward on the left side."
5,Awesome product,I purchase this Walker for my mother-in-law and she can finally around the house and when going shopping.She is enjoying getting around again and this Walker is made of High Quality materail and is strong and sturdy.Every thing else is just junk compare to this Walker.Awesome
1,not safe,I did not even have this for a month and it sheared the back wheel off and dumped me backwards. I had a broke foot and that is why I needed it. I ended up with very bad bruising on my arm and hip and my back. I landed on thick carpet so I was not to bad off because my house is mostly tiled. If I was a suing person I would have. I want to make sure this is taken off the market before anyone else gets hurt. I saw this in the Walgreen's also. Would not recommend.
4,great value,"loved this product... took my mother on road trip for 10 days and it was a great help for the steep inclines and descents during our trip .... she does not use a walker or cane but has some balance issues when walking great distance or up and down hills, this was a great support for her and a added bonus with the seat for a resting spot...one thing i would have liked is a small latch on bottom for when i closed it up so it would not reopen and also a brake pad on bottom for sitting and standing"
4,WALKER WITH WHEELS,"Seems to be well-constructed although wire basket can become dislodged when nudged. Also, while the walker does ""collapse"" for storage or transport, the arm/handles, unless unscrewed from the walker, take up sufficient space as to make transport awkward. In order to put walker in trunk of car, the arm/handles need to be removed. Aside from that we are very well pleased. This walker is being used by a 5""11"" man and is ""high"" enough for him, or even someone a few inches taller. The handles are adjustable."
1,Do Not Purchase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this item with the intention of receiving a basket cover, which was falsely advertised and agreed to extend commendations based on the idea that Medlife Health would accommodate this great inconvenience. The basket cover is still falsely advertised and the agreed reimbursement has not been credited to my account. Do Not Purchase!!!!!!!"
3,very useful,I puchased this for my 89 year old mother who is very unsteady on her feet. She uses it when we are on outings and it has made a world of difference in her ability to get around. She walks without assistance and all of her unsteadiness is gone when she is using it.
5,folding walker,"I bought this walker for my father. It is very sturdy, easy to put together and good quality. The seat cushion is nicely padded. It is very easy to push. The color is nice even for a man and helps for easier identification. I would recommend this product. For the price it is unbeatable."
4,very lightweight,"This walker is much lighter than it looks. It's quite stable, but it is little bulky. It doesn't fit into some very small cars."
1,should not be sold for old short people,It was for my 93 old mother but she couldn't use it as the seat was too high and there was no adjustment.
5,a very good buy,"This is a well-made walker--extremely easy to assemble--brakes can be engaged by a senior without any problem--folds readily, and can be placed in the open space between the front and back seats of a sedan--the width is perfect, so the walker can fit through any interior door space--I looked at a lot of 4-wheel walkers before buying this one--it is the least expensive of all the walkers that have this combination of features--and I feel confident in recommending it without reservation."
5,Solid Product! Great Price,Bought this walker for my grandma after a fall. Grandma loves the walker and is able to get all over the house without problems using the walker. She didn't want to admit she needed to use one until a couple of days after using it. Now she's cruising all around the house and taking it for walks. It's really helped her keep moving and has lifted her spirits. I also purchased the bag you can hang on it to carry her belongings and she uses that a lot as well. She said when she received the package at her front door she only had to snap in the top handle bars and it only took a minute to have it all together. This was a great bargain for the price!
5,Great Blades!,"These are some great blades! Wish the packaging included a way to dispose of them safely, though."
3,"Good Blade, Poor Pakaging","I find these excellent for shaving...if you can get a bladeout of the plastic holder. Unlike Personna, where you merelypush down on a notch and slide the blade out, here you have topush down directly on the paper-wrapped blade and then nudge itpast its opening. A problem I had (in all three packages)the protective wrapping got caught on the way out; this wasespecially true toward the end of the supply (last 2-3 blades).Also I found it difficult to slip a used blade in the back.TonyP"
1,Wrong style for razor ordered,"This is shown as the refill for the tiny moustache razor, wrong...., not the right ones, now I have to return and find the right ones."
4,Worth the money - more shaves per blade than the cheaper ones,"From what I've read online, Merkur blades are considered to be the baseline for what a ""good"" blade is. I've used a couple blades so far, and they do provide a nice, smooth shave. I got about 6 shaves out of one blade (2-passes with a down-stroke for reduction, 1 pass upward against grain to catch the small stuff) - I only use one of the two edges for any given shave. 2 sides x 3 shaves = 6 shaves total for one blade. The cheapo blades I got with the razor holder could do at most 4 shaves before it became intolerable to use them again. I definitely recommend getting these instead of buying a bunch of the cheaper ones!"
5,The Standard of Double Edge Razor Blades,I find the Merkur Double Edge Razor Blade to be the best blade for shaving with. A very consistent blade that is sharp and lasts.
5,Best Razors,These razors you cant beat. i change mine once about every week and a half i would use it past six shaves. They last forever and the more you buy the cheaper they're.
2,"Cheap, effective, but you can do better","The blades are inexpensive, work well and they do last for a few shaves. They were the first ones I tried, and I actually have a Merkur razor so I thought they'd work well together. However, after trying the Derby Extra's, I have to say that those are much better blades. As always your mileage may vary. I would recommend getting less than a 3 pack and just giving them a try if you really want to test them out."
4,Single Blades,Being a man of color I rely on the single blade razors. Merkur razors and blades have been the best for me no more bumps or ingrown hairs. I own two of them the long and short handles. I recommend them for all guys who have trouble with bumps and razor burn cause it is perfect for sensitive skin.
1,Quite Possibly the worst choice in a double edge blade,"I'm a bit stunned by these reviews. If you buy a Merkur Razor, this is possibly the worst choice in a blade. They are incredibly expensive, dull quickly, and provide a rather rough shave.If you are using a Merkur blade as your first DE blade, maybe you think it's great, but there are so many better choices that are a fraction of the cost.Please get a sampler pack of blades when you get your first DE razor. Derby, Gillette 7 O'Clock, Israeli Personna, and even Wal-Mart blades are a much better choice. These are terrible. I buy my favorite blade (Israeli Personna) for about 10 cents a blade with shipping. Derbys are pretty good too, at about 13 cents a blade."
3,Not the best,"I have compared Merkur with feather blades and feather is much more sharper and last longer. I will recommend to try feather also, before making decision."
1,Never will I buy these again!,"When I purchased my first Safety Razor, I bought a pack of these from Art of Shaving thinking that they were the best. I then used them for YEARS thinking this exact same thing. The amount of money that I wasted is horrifying. The time that I spent trying to get a good shave from Merkur blades is incalculable.I bought the Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades and could not be happier! And the best part... $8 for 100. Yes, $8 for 100 blades. Add to that the amazing shave, and you have yourself a true bargain!In case you are wondering, I use Olive Oil as a shave oil, then lather using Jack Black Supreme Cream. It is a bit of Shaving Bliss! I have even gone to shaving once a day!Don't Buy Merkur!"
2,Didn't work for me,"Tried these blades because it came with the Merkur razor that I bought. I've been using a Parker with Shark and Feather blades. The Merkur blade felt like I was dragging a brick across my face. Not a good experience at all. I would rank it behind Derby. Well behind Derby. They may work well for some, but I won't be using them. The razor itself is good, but not the blade."
4,worked well,"Son loved them with his new razor. We got the whole set... brush, razor and blades. He asked for them by name."
5,Great Rzor Blades!,"These blades are sharp and they last for many shaves. And for being a woman with a great deal more area to shave that means a lot. Now, a mans beard is rough but women have stickers. I guess we are even on that one but I really do like these blades."
3,Adequate and meets the need,The Merkur razors are good especially since there are few suppliers who sell double-edged razor blades these days. The razors are partculary good for people with sensitive skin who shave on a daily basis.
5,Mr. Jorge,The items were as described. Fast delivery and all items listed. The price is very affordable. I greatly recommend these razors to shave at an affordable price.
5,Razor edge,"They're just like the ones I used forty years ago. I decided to stop using plastic handled razors (which I disposed of every other day), and although greater care is needed when shaving with these 'raw' edges I'm glad I changed back. They last longer than dispo ones as well as being more environmentally friendly."
4,Runners World,"This magazine is very informative for a new marathon runner such as myself. A lot of detail was put into a shoe article that failed to capture my attention. I would like to see more articles for new runners about weight loss, training, and motivation. Right now race times and speed runs are way over my head."
2,Sondheim is my fav....but sheesh!,"There have been SOOOO many excellent concerts of Sondheim's work....and this ISN'T one of them. Many people hate Dame Edna's LADIES WHO LUNCH, well they are unaware that it is a joke! Maria Friedman disgraces all of Sondheim's beautiful work, as do many of her co-stars. Please consider another compliation of Sondheim's work."
1,What a disappointment!,I am a devoted Sondheim fan but these discs try my loyalty. Dame (or is it Damn?) Edna is an insult to Sondheim and his music. Now I know why they waited so long to release these discs.
1,buy from someplace with a good RETURN POLICY,"...mine actually made my TV picture *worse* for Chrissakes! I couldn't believe my eyes. I hope when Monster dealers get swamped with returns they'll get on the manufacturer's back about it, mine's a-goin' back PRONTO."
1,pull toy,Toy is WAY smaller than I thought it would be. Going to have to give it away as a gift instead of having my son use it.
5,Earthshaking,"After listening to this wartime 9th, I finally undertood why Beethoven wrote in the final movement ""friends, no more of these sounds..."""
2,Looks Pretty,Let me get right to it. This case looks real pretty and it is real quiet. For that I give it high marks. But the interior is a different matter altogether. There is little room to manuever inside. Everything is a tight fit. Also the power supply is in the front of the case. Using this layout I was UNABLE TO use the raid feature of my motherboard because the POWER SUPPLY IS IN THE WAY!!! BUT MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THE LACK OF DECENT DOCUMENTATION!!!! HELLO ANTEC WE NEED TO NOW HOW THINGS ARE CONNECTED TO THE MOTHERBOARD!!!!!! The documentation that was provided showed a diagram that was unreadable. Unfortunately going to their website is NO HELP!!! Overall I would give this case a grade of D.
2,What's with the picture of a different case,The picture of the open case could not possibly be this case. What is going on???????
5,Beautiful,"I really love this cd, I learned about this cd in my childhood because my father used to love it so much. Today, my father is gone and all I can have to remember him is this cd."
1,why?,"Why is it that when Dokken does an album that is different for them(Shadowlife) they get raked over the coals for it. But if Lynch does something even more different, he's just making a new and expieremental statement.I dont totally hate this album, but i will say that ""Erase the Slate"" is better,""shadowlife"" was better. I'll just say that i'm very dissapointed."
4,Superb blend of lotsa things,"Hey!Well dammit, I have always loved this album from day #1 (have the original SGR release w/ the xtra track) !!!And hell yeah, I'm from way back in the 80's and still love all the stuff I loved as a kid growing up (Ratt, Dokken, Mötley, Cinderella, ...).The only thing that's absolutely wrong with this release is the band name, Geo shouldn't have called it Lynch Mob... 's got absolutely nothing in common w/ that !If you give it a chance and don't compare it to the 1st 2 excellent LM albums, you might discover all the greatness stuffed inside of it (GREAT alt guitar work !!!).And yep, I can also perfectly understand why people hate this... but ya gotta respect Jorge for going his own way, no matter what !And for all the Oni and original LM-fanatics (like me, also), the 'Smoke & Mirrors' album is almost upon us (have a promo cd) and let me tell y'all: the Lynch Mob is BACK !!!Cheers from the Netherlands,Claw."
3,"should have been called 'lynch biskit""!","wow! at least this record ellicited strongly felt opinions..i think thats a good thing..this record just captured a moment in my life..i took a chance and went with my gut..i suppose it wasnt that well thought out and slightly self indulgent..maybe history will be kind towards the effort in retrospect..im releasing the souls of we record ""let the truth be known"" may 13th (2008)..its a very differant record as well..except noone will hate this one unless thier stupid or insane! love...g-shot! (george lynch)"
1,blows,"Where did Lynch go on this one? The two ""enlighted"" reviews I read on this were obviously written by guys that were smoking the same crack George was. Take the barbell off your head George...we always loved you're playing in all the groups you were in. Play again!"
1,truly terrible,I could hardly get through this. Quite often I may not like a CD or get it the first time through. I almost always give it another try later. I couldn't on this one. Its one of the worst things I have ever heard.
1,"Sad, sad and very dissapointing!!!","This was a sad day for metal when George Lynch threw this on his fans. The outrage I feel upon hearing this release is terrible. George is basically dragging the name Lynch Mob though the mud and almost burying it. Nobody, I mean nobody, who is serious and has a conscience of what good music is should own this CD. George, repent."
1,a reviewer from massachusetts,"mr.unscary is more like it! after the grunge cd shadow life,where george refused to play anything that ressembled the old dokken,this rap and roll cd is no surprise.if your looking for the old blues/neoclassical,and dark mysterious middle-eastern contemporary guitar stylings that seemed to signify the coming of the appocalypse,and earned him the title of mr. scary don't look here.the mr.scary from the 80's that played like there was no tomorrow,and made most other guitar players sound out-dated is gone on this rap rock cd,and probably gone forever...very sad!"
1,Doesn't even deserve one star!,"What in the world is George Lynch trying to do to his already declining career. This is one of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever listened to. When I opened the cover of the c.d. and saw his new band members, I knew that something seemed wrong. Then when I played it, I nearly puked. What the heck is George trying to prove by playing this rap-rock or whatever the hell people call it. I feel really sad about the whole thing too because I am a big fan of Dokken's and wished George would have stayed with the band and not allowed his ego to get in the way. Now I hear that he broke this band up and is trying to get the original Lynch Mob back together except for Mick of course. I could not listen to the entire c.d. that is how sick I got listening to this ""here today, gone tomorrow"" rap-rock crap."
1,Watch it go up in smoke,This CD was lacking of any musical talent. I expected a better performance from George Lynch. This was nowhere near the quality that Wicked Sensation was. Wish I could get my money back!
1,Selling out........,"George Lynch sells out on this one. Instead of doing what he does well, he put out some kind of rap or hip-hop to an already crowded market. Lynch Mob will never recover from this one. If you're looking for the sound you've come to expect from George in the past, I'd recommend you give Dokken's new CD, Erase the Slate a listen. As for George, maybe he can shed this mistake by going back to his old style with a solo album. I don't think folks will even consider anything with the name Lynch Mob on it in the future."
1,This Release Makes Me Vomit!!!,"Most of the other reviews on this page are ridiculous. I have been a George Lynch/Dokken fan for so many years, and let me tell you - I was extremely excited to see him put out a new CD. I ripped open the package, threw it in my player, and my jaw dropped to the floor. I sincerely thought that the wrong CD was placed in the case at the factory! He is an incredible guitar player that basically put his talent on the shelf for this one.This is a horrible attempt to captilize on the popularity of hardcore Rap music, and we all know that Rap rhymes with Crap, which thouroughly explains this CD. I returned it!!! Go get the new Dokken instead - sounds like Tooth and Nail era stuff - GREAT!! George needs to continue to work on his muscle building to defend himself angainst the fans that will want to smash him for putting out this garbage."
1,Lynch This Mob,"Now this cd does contain a track or 2 thats good... and uh, thats it. Some people want to expand their horizons, but should really know who they are by now and build upon their true strengths. If you are trying to decide whether to buy this or the new Dokken, here's some advice: Take your copy of Tooth and Nail/Under Lock and Key, insert in stereo, turn up full blast, grab a drink, lock the door, and realise there is truly NO going home."
2,Not Dokken or even Lynch Mob,"George Lynch takes a huge deparature from previous Lynch Mob and Dokken albums. This CD has rap / grunge elements in it but I didn't think it showcased Lynch enough. It almost sounds like Anthrax from time to time.Overall, though, the CD gave me a headache. There are a few decent songs, but the listener is forced to wade through a lot of bad ones.I think this shouldn't have been a Lynch Mob album. All the former band members are gone (except Lynch of course). If I were Lynch, I'd hire back the previous members, and quick."
1,"Isn't there a ""0 Star"" rating?","George, you've done it! This is honestly the worst CD I have ever bought. I am a fan of ALL kinds of music, and this is none of them. I liked the old stuff, but if you are gonna do Rock/Rap, AT LEAST DO IT RIGHT! Awful. If you insist on buying this, e-mail me and I will drive it to your house anywhere in the US."
2,Very Disappointed in the lack of hardedged rocknroll!,"I own Lynch Mob's first two cd's and needless to say I was very disappointed in this cd. It sounded like they were trying succomb to MTV or something. We don't need anymore rap n' rock bullcrap , play it like you feel.It wasn't the former energy and bite of the previous two cd's. George don't sell out , just play real rock n' roll."
1,VIOLENT GUT CHURNING NAUSIA!,"I'VE BEEN A G.L. FAN FOR 17 YEARS AND I MUST SAY, HE LOST ME ON THIS ONE. I MADE MYSELF LISTEN TO THE DISK IN HOPE IT WOULD GROW ON ME AS I AM A TRUE DIE HARD LYNCH FAN. HOWEVER, I AM NO FAN OF RAP. I AM NOT SURE WHAT G.L. IS IN SEARCH OF, BUT HE MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT FIND IT WITH THIS CD. SADLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed in MOMM,"I watched Rockstar INXS this summer and liked many of the artists. I felt this was a talented and diverse bunch. I have also been a long time fan of INXS. I ordered MOMM just to get a feel of what the Lovehammers were all about. I was really disappointed. I felt it lacked originality and depth. Three of the tracks were just painful and I had to skip over them. There were no songs that got underneath my skin or in my soul. Even though Marty was not my favorite, I feel he can do better than this. Musically, his band is not really tight. I feel there is one really good musician and the others could be replaced. All in all, it's no wonder they've been together 17 years and remained undiscovered. If we're judging by this album, they're just not that good. Hope they get better."
5,"Get this CD now, you can say you knew about Marty Casey way back when","Lovehammers are an excellent rock band. Marty Casey is going places!. If you have seen him on TV, do yourself a favor and get this CD so you can hear him with the band he's been playing with since he was a teenager. Play it loud, play it often."
5,Great Music,"This is a great cd that I can't stop listening to.I have been a Lovehammers fan for many years, and these guys are fantastic. Real rock, without any B.S. Get this cd before it becomes a collector's item."
5,HOW GREAT IS THIS,I love Call of Distress to anyone who watched Marty on Rock Star INXS you will remember how great he did Nirvana and Radio Head / Pink Floyd the list goes on. But the Lovehammers CD'S give way to Marty's own style and allow him to ROCK THE AUDIO ..To those who do not know the New Lovehammers cd comes out JAN 24TH !WITH THESE SONGS1. Casualty2. Hold On3. Trees4. Rain On The Brain5. The Tunnel6. Eyes Can't See7. The Riddle8. Clinic9. Call of Distress10. Straight as an Arrow11. Clouds
5,This one's gonna be on the top 100 albums ever!,"Highly recommended.....I'm glad Marty didn't win RSINXS, now he and the hammers have total freedom to rock they way they already know how to. A must have for any rock fan! A++++++ All the way! I loved all songs on this CD...if you like Marty on TV you'll love him and the guys here."
4,Lovin' the Lovehammers,I love this CD....and i ordered the rest of this fabulous group CD's that have been released!!!
2,My cats wouldn't use it,"It might work for someone else, but it didn't work here. My three cats studiously ignored it. I've found that a cheap plastic comb works beautifully and my cats love it."
2,Not Impressed,"Well, I was semi-excited to try this product. When I first picked it up I felt that the bristles were a little rough. When I got it home my cats showed SOME interest in it...but I think that was only because of the catnip that is already in the product. Though, my cats did rub against it a little after examining the product after they ""used"" it I saw that basically no hair had caught on to it.I could easily make something a little rough with catnip on it for my cats to rub their head against.Not worth almost 20 dollars. Not even worth $5 in my opinion. I will be returning it."
3,Seemed like a good idea,"Our cats pretty much ignore it. I haven't figured out how to show them what it's for - so far they just run through it every now and then, scratch at the base, and one of them chews on it every now and then (which we don't think is a good idea). Not sure if it's a design flaw or just our cats' personalities."
4,My cats LOVE it!,"I introduced my cats to this by sprinkling a little dried catnip on it, and they took to it immediately! I have five cats and getting any help I can to keep up with their brushing is a huge help. Yes, this brush gets absolutely loaded with cat hair every week (better that than my furniture!) and I use the hose vacuum attachment and it does a great job of pulling the hair out.So, why not 5 stars? I had to glue the brush into the base to keep it from coming out. Until I figured that out, I was having to push the brush onto the base and I ""squashed"" the top of the bristles in the process. It is still very popular with my cats, I just wish I had thought about glueing it to the base earlier."
1,dull like a happy meal toy,theres a reason this show airs in the morning now. it makes you want to leave the house. keeps me on time for work i guess.
4,"Funny and cute, fun for kids and adults","Jaded teenagers full of angst, beware! This is not the show for you. There will be no swearing, no innuendo, no gratuitous violence. When someone gets shot out of the sky, they are careful to show that they parachuted to safety. If someone acts unkind, they are not rewarded for it.The characters are likable and very interested in being the good guys. There is lots of little quips and moral stories, though its not so overbearing that it detracts from the show.Nothing deep, nothing adult. Its silly and I couldn't live on it anymore than I can live on cotton candy, but its refreshing. If you're a parent who is concerned with what their kids watch, this is a show you can enjoy with them and not worry about, and you can both enjoy it together.The graphics are even top notch, better than most kids shows go for today too."
5,Awesome!,The show is very well-done in all aspects. The only bad thing I want to point: season 3 remains unveiled and the producers don't say a thing about it.In fact a magnificent production!
4,elegant,"Now I believe Ziegler,a jazz master,is the best interpreter of Piazzola's tango. Only he can get the spirit of Piazzola."
5,WOW!,"I couldn't believe how good this album sounds. These are classic recordings, but sound like they were recorded yesterday! And that is just the icing on the cake. This album is packed with my favorite Jolson classics. He really covers the whole spectrum of songs on this one, and does a very fine job doing so. This CD is a nice surprise after being so let down with other Al Jolson CD's that don't even sound as good as the original recordings on vinyl."
4,Good basic phone,"I bought the krzr k1 to replace the motorola v330. I've had it for almost a month now. Most of the features are pretty standard these days ... 2MP camera, a slot for MicroSD card, voice dial etc. The camera isn't great but is useful when you lack a digital camera. It's got a great battery life. It can last upto week on standby and moderate phone usage, much better than the v330. Overall, it's a good phone if you're looking for basic call features.Pros:Great Battery lifeGood signal receptionCons:The keypad could be a problem for people with large fingersThe external display is smallMissed calls are not displayed on the external display after a little while."
2,Just stops working!,"I purchased 3 phones for my family... a V3xx, a Nokia 6126 and this KRZR for myself. It was the only one that was DOA right out of the box. Okay, not a big deal, one defective unit. I sent it back and received another one. This one worked great... or so I thought. But a week after having it my wife called on my land line and said she was calling and calling but I wasn't picking up my cell. I checked, and it had no indication of any calls. I tried calling out and it wouldn't dial. It was frozen... sort of. So I thought, maybe it needed a reset. I powered down, powered up, and it worked fine the rest of the day. Okay, it was a fluke. But then it did the same thing the next day, then the next. It sure is a beautiful and compact phone and I'm going to miss that, but I'm dumping it because I need a phone that works ALL the time, not just part of it. Sorry Motorola, I've been a loyal customer, but you blew it with this phone."
2,Too bad,"I was excited about the style and sleekness...Unfortunately, the quality doesn't match up.The messaging is screwy. It isn't very reliable. It doesn't always ring when someones calling even though you're in range.Plus, I dropped it once and the front is cracked! I don't know about you, but i need a strong phone that can take a little beating.Would NEVER get this phone again."
4,Stylish and functional but slow,"I am coming from a Razr and the Krazr is a great phone, no doubt. The size is the main attraction. Fits easily in your pocket without a bulky case. Screen is a bit small and the menus are slow. The quality also does not match the Razr, it is not as clear or toned. The micro SD card is a great feature and the mp3 player is huge. It also takes pretty good pictures. I would recommend this to anyone."
2,Terrible phone,"My battery would die out in half a day, yes I charged it as specified. Had to get a new one within months. Finger prints are not a problem if you have a cover, but then you cannot see then phone finish. The buttons are a pain to use, the voice activation works when it wants, and i s s l o w. Although many functions appear to be somewhat faster with this new battery, I would not recommend this phone to any adult. The younger crowd probably loves it's color and mp3, not for me. NEW BATTERY,NO JOY!!E V E R Y B U T T O N T A K E S 4 E V E R T O C H A N G E F U N C T I O N, TAKES 15 Seconds to turn volume up or down. Getting a new phone, you can buy this one from me on ebay, I will pay you to take it."
1,Junk phone,"It hangs so frequently. Needs to be powered off the phone to receive or make calls, when it hangs. Digital Music player doesn't respond. Planning to replace with some other phone."
1,motorola krzr the worse,it's the 2nd phone you sent me and it is the same as the first one after I use it 3 or 4 days it does not work anymore and after talking with att 3 or 4 time the support technitians tell me to turn it off and on again and it starts working again its the worse phone i ever had and I dont undestand whow you dont have more complaints I have to buy a new phone and I will definitely won't buy it from you.thanksJuan P
4,Great phone for the price.,I recently bought this phone. I was a little disappointed initially with the sound quality when not using the speakerphone. But since then it either started working good or I got adjusted to the quality ;-). One other complaint I have is that you have to open the phone to use the speaker phone. But once you get used to opening the phone with one hand it wont be such a problem any more. When you open the phone and place it on a flat surface (say when typing something or so) it wobbles because the camera protrudes from the rear. Once again this is a minor issue.I like using the QWERTY keyboard to enter my contacts and notes. The calendar allows you to enter events. I like this functionality a lot. You can assign shortcuts(4) to things that you do the most. Bluetooth functionality works well. The battery is really good (although most batteries tend to do good at the beginning). The pictures taken with the camera are good.
4,Motorola KRZR K1,"Very good phone. Compact, light, stylish, with easy to navigate menu. A bit slow in responses but overall very satisfactory."
3,"OK Phone, But the visa gift card never show up as promised by amazon",Be very careful if any rebate or gift card related item is tied to your amazon purchase. You may never be able to get it or only through very hard struggle to get it from amazon.The phone works OK. No fancy fucntions is need.. Lower price plan should be the key.
2,Lame Duck!,"This is my first ""flip phone"" and I still can't get the hang of opening this phone with one hand. It's always full of fingerprints which ruins the visual appeal of the glass face. I find that the keypad can't be done just by feel and the darn keypad backlight needs the keypad pushed to come back on but also when to push the mystery button it also tries to perform that function. Call quality is fine but doesn't do much else. Camera and ringtones are mediocre and no free games! Also kinda heavy but I do like the speakerphone."
1,sync software will wipe out contacts on your computer,"The phone is reasonably good, assuming you don't mind it crashing once or twice per day. If you need to sync with Microsoft Outlook, however, you need to buy software separately for about $40. It will take an hour or so to download. After a couple of syncs, you will find that a lot of information has been lost on your computer. The phone, for example, cannot deal with a contact that has just a business name and no person's name. First the contacts show up as headless zombies on the phone. Then the company name gets wiped out from Outlook on your computer."
5,Incredible Collection of some of Armstrong's best known,"Having been an avid admirer of Armstrong's work (I can and have listened for years, with no tiring), I found this to be the best overall survey of Armstrong's career that I've yet found. It has select versions of many of Armstrong's most popular including an excellent rendition of Mack the Knife and an exquisite Blueberry hill, among many others. I have bought this for myself and used it to introduce several people to Armstrong with great success. You cannot lose with this collection!"
4,Doomed to Repeat?,"This work would have benefited from editing. It tends to jump from person to person, place to place, time to time. Nevertheless it is the first work I have had the good fortune to read that is unafraid to expose the underlying causes of the French Revolution, and to reveal something more than the popular characterizations of its leading actors.The sixteen women who are the focus of this account are true heroines, true martyrs of the Revolution. The author has done us a great service in providing non-fictionalized biographies of these Carmelite nuns - they represent sincere people from every walk in life who are determined to follow their consciences no matter what 'everyone else' may think and do.May their history inspire our compatriots to imitate their example, cost what it may."
5,Good read!,"Excellent book. Very informative as well as an easy read. I was, frankly, expecting the book to be a sort of textbook and difficult to read. It is not and I enjoyed it thoroughly though the subject matter is disturbing because It's easy to draw a comparison to the present time."
2,Like this model? Better buy TRV250 then!,"Beware! It doenst have a remote control. Otherwise it is same as the TRV250 model. Still, it costs much more than TRV250. Better go and buy TRV250, it is amazing.I also planned on buying TRV260, but just realized in time that 235 was certainly the better of the two, lesser price and you get remote control too! Now, thats a deal!"
2,Didn't include playback feature,I need the camera to playback previously recorded Hi8 tapes. It wouldn't play them back. Just a blue screen. Not sure why. Seems like a basic function to me
2,disappointing,"Very slow to focus! Compared to older models it is very shakey as well. It does not hold a candle to last years trv250 model, so check your stores as I found last years model at a great price."
3,BEWARE! No Remote Control Capabilities!,"As For Overall Quality, I Am Satisfied With This Camera, However I Will Be Returning It Because, Not Only Did It Not Come With A Remote Control, When I Inquired Further I Was Informed That The Camera Does Not Even Have An Input Jack Where A Wired Remote Can Be Used, Nor Does It Have The Infrared Components Necessary For It To Be Compatible With A Wireless Remote. I Can Not Accept Not Having A Remote, So I Will Be Returning The Item. I Have Used It For Two Weeks And I Am Satisfied With The Cam Other Than The Lack Of Remote. If A Remote Is Not Necessary, This Would Be A Good Choice. I Had An Older Model HandyCam Before And I Used The Remote All The Time Not Only When Recording Video, But Also When Playing Back The Video And Transferring The Video To VHS."
1,Don't Buy a Sony product,"The camcorder was purchased as a Christmas present. We took it on a cruise in early January. After only a few days it gave us a moisture message and stopped working. Sony claims we dropped it in water and wants over three times what we paid for the camera to repair it. We did not drop the camera in the water, we do not have films of our vacation. We are just out our recorded memories and $300. We will never recommend a Sony product to anyone."
1,this product is the worst,"I did a roller set with this product yesterday, trying it for the first time at I simple HATE IT, made my hair hard to comb , crunchy ugly stiff fake looking curls, a MUCH better product is B&B FOAM WRAPPING lotion which I use all the time but this particular store didnt have it and I tried this instead. What a mistake, I will stay with B&B which ALL of my sets have turned out beautiful, touchable,pretty soft curls without that ugly fake stiffness. I dont know why these companies think that is what black hair should be like, HELLO I know I would rather have touchable hair without that stiffness and fakeness...do yourself a favor and do not buy this product, if you like that ugly, crunchy, stiff hair with no movement, then this is the product for you!"
1,childrens book,"This came a dirty, needed cleaned up, but the pages was not torn, so it will be useable."
4,"""high pitched"" as usual","Dieselboy represents his crew on this cd mostly, which is no surprise. Heck, with talent like that, why not? I always find his sets interesting, not so much for track selection, but for the speed he spins the records at. He's got the pitch up really far on this cd, as usual, so all the beats sound (even more) fast and furious. If you know Dieselboy, this cd is no surprise. If you don't, you might be left staring at you speakers dumb-founded the first time 'round. Nothing ground-shattering in the track selection, but they're good current techstep tracks nonetheless."
4,Soldier's Story: A solid release from d'n'b's best DJ,"Dieselboy certainly asserts his authority as one of the best (if not THE best) drum and bass DJ on the decks nowadays. Soldier's Story is his best release to date. If you've caught a live set within the last few months, you've heard many of the tracks on this disk. Tracks by Konflict, Technical Itch and Usual Suspects drive this album, which remains consistently strong while allowing for some requisite down-time to ocassionally catch your breath."
2,How could this have happened?,"As an avid listener of Tisziji's music and a student of his written works, I'll have to concur with Mr. Wail's assessment of this disc, especially in the context of the other music that Tisziji has created. While the solos have their high points, to my ears they come nowhere close to the intense, profound revelations that occur regularly on his other albums."
2,Betty Buckley 15 yr. anniversary Rerelease,"Very disappointed that I spent the money on this. Only song I knew and I am 62 yrs. old was the song ""memory"" from ""cats"" Sorry I spent my money on this."
5,Epiphany at St. Bart's,"Betty Buckley performed this concert in 1984 at Saint Bartholomew's Church in New York City to benefit the homeless. This is a jazzy breezy collection of songs, many of them written by Buckley herself. She describes the ones she wrote as ""philosophical jump-rope songs that kids might like that would also address some of the questions about things that are tough in life"". The songs ""Co-Wrangle-Do-Right"" and ""Over You"" are the standout pieces on this CD. A wonderful CD to put on after a tough day and let the music massage your nerves until you feel human again."
5,Best Betty Buckley recording,"This is Betty at her finest - and most of the songs are her own. Her vocal technique, range, pitch, interpretation, everything - are letter-perfect. An amazing, one-of-a-kind voice. Miss Buckley is nearing 60, but her voice is still powerful - especially on ""The London Concert"" and ""Evening at Carnegie Hall"", not to mention ""Betty Buckley's Broadway"". I recommend them all, and I also recommend attending one of her wonderful concerts to fully experience the magic of this wonderful singer and person."
5,"Interesting, stimulating, and original","I learned more from this book about recent poetry than from any other. I found the insights sharp and the comments to the point; and there was also a lack of the usual 'knowing' tone of academic books. There are many illuminating analyses of poems from 'The Waste Land' to 'V' and this leads to a marvellously full overview of the range of British poetry from Rupert Brooke to Seamus Heaney. I found it enrmously helpful for my essays, but I would have read it anyway!"
4,SICK! YET FUNNY........Hmmmmm,"This movie has it all: Funny moments, feel good moments, and some sad stuff. It will make you laugh, cry, and be totally grosed out at one point. So watch, and enjoy."
2,"(2 1/2 stars) Somewhat entertaining, but don't pay to see it!","I generally enjoy the work of every person in the cast of this movie. But I didn't enjoy this one very much, and I am rather grateful I did not buy the DVD. RUMOR HAS IT just wasn't funny enough or clever enough. It certainly had its moments, especially at the beginning. But eventually the plot gets so ridiculous that it is hard to laugh. Unless you are absolutely sure that you will like this movie, wait until it comes on cable!"
3,Just okay,"This was an okay semi-chick-flick way to kill an hour and a half.What I liked about it:A few funny momentsA slightly different idea, not exactly what we've seen a million times.Probably most people can identify with the feeling that you don't ""fit"" with your family, or they all seem strange.Here's what I didn't like:The movie was a 1/2 hour idea padded to be a movie.The idea of sleeping with someone you know slept with your mother AND grandmother - ick!!A few extremely improbably coincidences.I didn't get all the stuff about Pasadena, must be LA in jokes, not meant for us ""outsiders"".This is another one I wouldn't recommend buying, but might rent on a rainy Saturday afternoon. I ended up doing some work and cooking dinner while watching because it didn't feel like you had to pay close attention every minute.I normally strongly dislike Costner, but he wasn't too bad in this."
4,Loved it. A lot.,"Not a Friends fan, but Jennifer Aniston is undeniably likable. Mark Ruffalo? A vision to behold in everything he does. Both pretty good actors, but it's their charm that really does it. The movie? Yeah, it's average, but it's on the good end of average. One that I will be buying as soon as I get the chance. And if nothing else, to watch Mark Ruffalo whenever I want!!"
4,A decent rental...........,"I'll admit when I originally saw the preview for this movie, I thought: Ugh, that looks really stupid!! Well it was recently on my premium movie channel and I started watching it. It begins with Sara (Jennifer Aniston) heading with her boyfriend/fiancee to her younger sister's weddding. Once there she gets involved in a 'rumor' about her family and finds out her deceased mom and very much alive grandmother slept with the same guy and they made a movie about it: The Graduate! Now she becomes obsessed with finding this guy. She goes and finds him and a romance ensues (onces she's sure he's not her dad, I'll admit that part was kind of weird.) It goes on from there. I won't ruin the ending, but it was a bit anti-climatic. I can see why Jennifer Aniston is trying to disown this one, but it's a decent rental. It is better than some of the other romantic comedies Hollywood has been trying to shove down our throats lately, that's for sure. Give it a try!!"
4,A Classic Feel with a Modern Twist,"I watched this as a fan of many of the actors in it, but not of the generation wowed by the original ""The Graduate"" movie. I was not disappointed; however, I did not find a new favorite either. The performances are very solid, and the characters are well-developed. The plot is far-fetched, but somehow beliveable as it explores the real-life implications of the foundational theme of The Graduate in ways they could have never quite anticipated. It is a little slow once or twice, but has a lovely girl-trying-to-find-herself romantic movie feel. I recommend this one--it'll even make you laugh a few times!"
2,Rumor Has It....,"I agree that Jennifer is not a very good actress. When there needs to be softness, she is still harsh, blunt, and to the point. I think the movie, overall, was a funny and cute movie. But Mark Ruffalo (who I usually like) and Jennifer Aniston were #1 not a good match and #2 acted poorly in this film."
2,"Misleading promotion, missed opportunity","RATING = * * 1/2Promotion for this film led us to believe it was a little mystery wrapped in a comedy. While a bit of both, it wasn't enough of either to give it the identity it needed. And that's a shame.Given the premise -- Anniston suspects she might be the love child of The Graduate's Ben Braddock -- this held a lot of potential. But once the jig was up, there was no place to go. We were left with under-developed characters and story lines that were shallow and incomplete. Opportunity lost.The likable Anniston has a few good turns and Costner delivers a solid performance, but even they couldn't fill-in the missing pieces. A-List stars and slick production alone do not a good movie make. At least not enough to fill 90 minutes or warrant a $10 ticket or $20 purchase."
2,A waste of time with few laughs,The critics did not like this film but the trailer looked goods so I rented it and it was bad the trailer shoed all the good stuff. The movie is a big fluff with a story that really gose now here and when it's done you think what happend what twas the point. The film is very boring with a few laughs and has ok acting Shirley McLain is the only good part of the whole movie as she steals every scene she is in. I found Aniston whiney and COstner boring. The directing si bad. It's like the film tried to hard to be good but it failed. There are some funny moments but only some not enough to recomand this movie.
4,I thought it was interesting,"The beginning was rather boring, but after that it was very interesting. I enjoyed it and would recommended anyone to watch it."
2,So Much Potential.....,"Could've been great with this cast, but kind of falls flat. Shirley Maclaine is fabulous however."
4,Cute Movie,"Thought I'd write this review to counter all the negative reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Didn't generally care for the Mark Ruffalo character, but liked all the other participants. I think it was better for the Jennifer Anniston character to be concerned before her marriage, than to get married and to realize that it was a mistake. Really liked Costner's character. And agree with all of the positive reviews about Shirley Mclaine. It probably helped that I loved ""The Graduate"". But ""Rumor.."" is a fun movie. Just relax, ignore the ""other"" reviews and enjoy the movie."
2,Slow,"Very slow and rather cliché. I thought Jennifer Aniston did a good job, however, making the movie merely bad rather than terrible. Maybe worth the $3 rental but don't buy it."
2,Was hoping for way better; this was awful,"I got this movie from the local library because I didn't want to waste the money on renting it. Thankfully I did that because this was plain awful. I had higher hopes w/ this cast (clearly not that high since I wouldn't rent it) but honestly, from the get go, this movie was just a plain awful chick flick. It really wasn't funny and I regret watching it!"
2,"I wanted to yell ""Jennifer your hair is too long"" and so is this turkey of a movie",What is bad about the movie:This screenplay is built on a stupid premise and just doesn't work as a Romantic comedy.. you really don't identify with anybody except Mark Ruffalo's character. Kevin Costner is awful... why not Dustin Hoffman redo his role? Jennifer Aniston is bad and her hair is way too long.What is good about the movie:Mark Ruffalo is very good. Shirley MacLaine is funny and if anything gets people to forget Bewitched.
2,Mediocre at best,"We watched this movie not knowing anything about it other than the write-up on the DVD case, and we found it to be an incredibly disappointing experience. Aniston seems to have taken a course in emoting one emotion--pensive confusion--and isn't at all believable as a character, especially when she sleeps with Costner's character. Ruffalo and MacLaine are pretty good, but playing characters they've played before, especially MacLaine. If you've seen her somewhat-crotchety grandmother-type role, then you've seen her in this, too. The script is simply strange--this is one of those stories that doesn't seem to be deserving of having a film made about it, as there's very little here that's compelling or even interesting. The back of the DVD says ""The story is rumor. The laughs are real!"" Interesting. . . we didn't find much to laugh about at all. Your life will not be missing anything if you pass on this one!"
1,Comedy or Drama?,"The premise is great, finding out you are from the legendary family immortalized in the book and movie The Graduate. The actors are wonderful... Shirley Maclaine, Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo etc... all really good comedic actors. The director world famous. The movie was marketed as a romantic comedy. So what happened...where is the comedy? It's slow, cumbersome and doesn't seem to know in what direction it wants to go and definitley not funny. Shirley Maclaine's character is the only funny one in the film. It should have been marketed as a melodramatic comedy easy on the comedy. Rent it don't buy it, it's not worth your money."
4,Dude...,"Why this title, you might wonder, the reason is quite simple: Dude...this movie rocks! At some times it might be a bit boring, But I'm just a teen.Whatching the movie is a must but would be enjoyed more if you've accully seen ""The Graduate""! I had to explain ""The Graduate"" to all my friends and only then, they could really understand it. Once this movie comes out on DVD, I'm totally gonna get it!"
3,Jennifer Aniston is great but the movie isn't.,"Jennifer Aniston is a talented actress, i loved her on Friends and in The Good Girl, but i was very disappointed that Rumor has it... did not make me jump for joy. I love Director Rob Reiner as well, he has directed some great films, like Stand by me, When harry met sally, and The story of us, but this film was slow and not funny at all. Shirley McClaine holds this film together but her jokes are kind of vulgar and strange. I wanted to like this film, the trailer was deceiving, it looked like a comedy but it is mainly a drama. Mark Ruffalo and Kevin Coster are superb as Aniston's love interest in the film but the storyline never caught on and after awhile you just don't care if the so-called rumor is true or not, heck even Derailed was better than this. Hopefully Aniston can pick a finer film next time around, this wasn't for her."
4,Grandma is Mrs. Robinson,"Jennifer Aniston plays a girl who is engaged to be married, but is confused about whether the marriage is the right thing for her or not. She goes home for her sister's wedding and discovers that her family is the real-life version of the Robinsons from the classic movie ""The Graduate"". Though this seems highly unlikely, it serves as a rather interesting premise for the movie. Since her mother died when she was nine, Anniston has searched for her own identity and she has wondered if her parents were truly happy in her marriage. She looks for the answer to this enigma, and in dong so, she is able to make her own decision about her future. This is a charming film with a delightful cast (particularly Shirley MacLaine as Aniston's grandmother) and is definitely a cut above most romantic comedies."
3,"It was all right,...","Okay, it definitely wasn't worth seeing twice, but it was all right. The only character I really liked was Jeff, the fiance of Sara. I thought she treated him poorly, no mater how scared she was supposed to be. Kevin Costner's character, Bo, was disgusting & I didn't think he was very convincing for some reason. The Dad was good, especially at the end. Well, that's all I have to say really...Rumor Has It isn't a keeper but if you are bored it'll pass the time"
1,"The rumor is true, this movie STINKS !!","Yet another incident of poor film making from Hollywood. This trend is more the rule than the exception lately. Jennifer Aniston, though quite good at tv shows, fails to live up to anything remotley called acting on the big screen. She lacks presence and her rather seemingly boring personality in interviews finds it way when she acts too. She just doesn't have the "" it "" factor and I presume her future roles will be nothing too spectacular. The other actors were not so great either and for sake of brevity let me just mention than no one in this movie will walk away with an award from the prestigious academy of fine film acting. A sloppy , disheveled movie with little substance and little thought in the best ways to entertain a paying audience. It would be more reasonable to wait for this on video as there is this clever little invention called fast forwarding. Yes, there is some justice in the world. (:>"
3,SAVED BY MACLAINE,"Don't get me wrong, the acting was good all around. The idea that a woman is so confused that she'll sleep with the guy that might be her father, grandfather, or both because she's having second thoughts about her own impending marriage seems a little less than funny, and the ending ( How pathetic could a man be? ) was a bit more than unbelievable. Rob Reiner must have been channeling his inner 'Lynch' when he chose to do this film ( although, David Lynch would have probably made a lot more sense of this mess of a script ).On the plus side there were some funny moments, and then there was Shirley MacLaine. She owned every scene she was in, and made a nearly mediocre movie ( despite it's great cast ) not only palatable, but entertaining."
3,Comedy.. yeah right...,"First of all this movie should not be marketed as a Comedy. It is anything but funny... I did not laugh once. It was amusing to see Jennifer Anniston try to NOT act like Rachel, and failing horribly.The storyline of this movie was not at all entertaining. How did so many stars sign on for basic crap? Overall I would advise all to save your money, don't even RENT the DVD. It is hardly worth your time. If you want to surround yourself with crap, head to the local dump.There was some positive points- Jennifer Anniston's hair was styled very nicely. Each and every scene her hair was the bomb.. If only hair could carry a movie."
2,Not Good at All,"I knew this was a lackluster movie before I watched it, but I was desperate for HD DVD material. While it was not painfully bad, it was boring and superficial. Jennifer Aniston basically plays herself (or any of her other characters on TV/movies.) She is confused and not sure she wants to marry her fiance-snooze. If that was not enough, Aniston-in typical golddigger [...]fashion-sleeps with Kevin Costner. This is the man she suspected of being her father and she knew had slept with her grandmother! But because he is rich and powerful she jumps in the sack with him. The lone bright spot is the grandmother played by the great Shirley Maclaine, but even some of her lines seem forced and fall flat. The HD DVD version is crammed onto a single (15 GB) layer of the disc so the picture quality is only ok (the DVD version occupies the other layer). If you have absolutely nothing else to do then perhaps this is worth watching. But I recommend you find another diversion."
4,Much better than expected,This is far funnier than the typical romance-comedy. Aniston plays her stereotypical female in crisis role. Costner and MacLaine added more laughs. You may know the plot but it's still so funny. I highly enjoyed this flick.
4,The Graduate 2,"""Rumor"" is a good movie, but you definately need to see ""The Graduate"" first - or the movie just won't reach its potential. Kevin Costner is great once again and Jennifer Aniston gives what could be her best performance to date.For those that ever wondered what happened after ""The Graduate"" - after as in the next 30 years - then ""Rumor"" is a movie you need to see. Funny, dramatic, it draws you in and makes you not want to miss a scene. A must see."
2,let me tell you that...,"this movie sucked!!!it had nice cast... but horrible acting i guess O_omark ruffalo sounded so fake :Sand well the plot wasnt THA plot, but what can i say? I DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL!!!so boring, and the jokes didnt make me laugh =("
1,boring movie,"I was disappointed by this movie. No funny jokes, no interesting plot or characters,..."
1,Rumor Has It,"I bought Rumor Has It, and I sold it the next day. Does that explain my review of the film?"
3,Rumor has it,"When I played the video last night, it wouldn't work on my DVD player, I tried it in my room, and it kept skipping, the only way it did work was through my computer, it was ok but kept stopping, since I got it really cheap I'm not going to return it !"
2,Not just a rumor - it really isn't funny,"With Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo, Shirley MacLaine and Kevin Costner you would have reason to believe this could be fun. Add Director Rob Reiner and now you are on the comedy train but as the minutes ticked by, it soon became clear this movie was not working. It's the script. From the opening voice-over narration, I was lost on what the rumor was and why I should care. The punch lines were mostly flaccid regardless of the high-priced and competent acting talent delivering it. And how in God's name could it ever be humorous to speculate that the man you just had sex with could be your father? This movie is better to look at with the sound turned off. One exception is Shirley Maclaine who was a welcome respite in this sea of wasted talent."
3,Rumor Has It,"The Graduate is a classic cult film, and since this movie was based on it, I was hoping for the best, but not expecting much. I was never more wrong! Jennifer Aniston was refreshing, but I had dry heaves when she slept with a man her mother and grandmother did especially when she thought at first he could be her father. That is just not entertaining in any situation. Kevin Costner was good in his role, but the ewwww factor was too much. Mark Ruffalo gave probably his best performance to date. The most surprising performance was from Shirley MacLaine, and she was absolutely fabulous. She held her own in every scene. It didn't matter who she shared screen time with, she stole the limelight."
2,Rumor has had it...,"The movie, with all of the big name talent behind it - Jennifer Anniston et al (and even George Clooney as one of the producers) - certainly was a let down. For anyone who is familiar with The Graduate (and who isn't these days), the movie will pique your interest if only because it revisits much of the myth behind the movie and whether or not what took place was based on a true 'rumor' if you will. The movie seemed to bank on too many cliches, especially those we find in the romantic comedy genre and the end, where Mark Ruffalo is waiting for Jennifer outside the elevator after she leaves his apartment in tears is as done and as flat as a climactic scene can get. Go out and rent something else because this movie will surely disappoint you."
2,This is a comedy?,Do you really care about another 30-something coming to grips with adulthood? Grow up. What a waste.
4,Chick Flick,"Good piece of fluff. Improbable plot, but am a fan of Jennifer Anniston and Kevin Costner so I enjoyed it."
5,Thats whut it dooooo,"Yep, you can definitely step yo game up with this one. Its written with major info for the game. Its written from a business standpoint. For those trying to be in ""the Life"", here are some of the rules."
4,PRODUCT REVIEW,"While this item may have been shipped one day sooner than I had expected ..I am slightly disappointed that the ""color"" of the item was navy blue.A review of the ad itself, indicates three (3) available colors ..""hunter green"" ""tan"" or ""burgundy"".Since this product takes up floor space, it is always nice to have the option to select the color that best suits the room decor. Wouldn't you agree?With that said ..you may want to adjust your product description. Thanks!Lisa A. Johnson"
5,Great Product For The Price,Great product and you can't beat the price. I found that buying the flat connectors at an electronics store were very helpful vs. trying to connect with bare wires. I am running 3 sets of speakers and they all work fine. I've used it for two weeks now and still no smoke from my amp...that's a good sign!
5,Monster Satisfied,I bought two MSS-4's.Hooked them up to my Harman/Kardon 3480 stereo receiver. They were easy to hook up. I like the feature of push type terminals. Other boxes I worked with had screw type plug-in that made it sometimes hard to get the wire in. You could also misplace the push-in connectors. Replaced all the old speaker wire with new Monster XP (XPMS). The box handles the power of the HK 3480 and my Cewin-Vega's never sounded better. The MSS-4 also looks great in my stereo cabinet.
4,Item works great,"The item works just as we needed to. The sound is great. the only complaint I have is with the suggested Monster angle plugs. I am using 14 gauge cable and I used the suggested angle plugs on one speaker and just bare speaker wire on the other speaker and I cannot tell a difference, and the bare cabel fits in deeper and easier than the angle plugs, so i would suggest don't waste your money on the angle plugs.The speaker slector works perfect and the sound is crisp and clear just what we were looking for."
2,Quit working after a few months,"Product work well for a couple of months, then the right channel went dead. Awaiting word from Monster about warranty repair or replacement."
5,Excellent product for the money,Monster SS4 Multi-Speaker Selector is an excellent product for the money I paid around $20 plus $ 5 shipping. I hooked 4 speaker sets to 1 amp and it's working great. I used 16 gauge speaker wires which fits well.Highly recommend this product for those who use 16 AWG wire or higher gauge. Quality of the product is great and no issues so far (2 weeks of my purchase)
2,DOA out of the box and please read description....,First off mine came DOA out of the box. Im going to return it as well anyways and heres why. If you look at the pictures the buttons on the front they look like volume controls but there not. They are simple on/off switches which let you select which room you want to turn on or off. This is my fault for not reading the description but from the pictures they look just like volume controls which is what I needed in the first place. Just wanted to let everyone know this before making the mistake like I did.
3,Adequate but nothing special,"I have the SS4 hooked up to Sony Receiver in my Kitchen. I have 3 pairs of Polk RC60i speakers in my kitchen/bar/dining room and 1 pair of Atrium 45s on my patio. All are connected to the SS4. It sounds perfect with 1 pair active, but there is an audible increase in distortion as I turn additional pairs on. It's not terrible--fine for ambient music and NPR, but not good enough for focused listening. There's also a small volume decrease but that isn't really a problem.My application required mounting the SS4 vertically so I removed the stick-on rubber feet from the bottom and put them on the side. This ""works"" but the unit is a little unstable and the case isn't really flat on the side. Granted, it is not designed for this but if you are considering a vertical mount you may one to know this. Also, one side is vented so make sure to put that side up if you go vertical."
4,Monster Cable SS4 Multi-Speaker Selector,"Am very please with the Monster SS4 Multi-Speaker Selector. I am not an audiophile but the output quality seems excellent to my ears on my system. Easy installation and sturdy quality product. My only criticism is that one of the 4 rubber disks that make up the ""feet"" for this product was missing, making it unstable. I purchased 4 new ones at a local hardware store and replaced the factory ones without difficulty. Perhaps better attention to detail in the quality control department would be my recommendation."
3,Monster Cable SS4 Multi-Speaker Selector review,"I think this Monster Cable SS4 Multi-Speaker Selector is a very good product. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the weak tension-grip receivers, ...not really strong enough for heavy wire, in my opinion. If you use 14 gauge wire, it's a little tricky getting the wires in the receiving holes without unraveling the ends. Don't use this model if you plan to use heavier wire (12 gauge) unless you use other connectors. I did hook up four sets of speakers using 14 gauge wire, and sounds great. Be sure to place it in a place that doesn't move around a lot to assure good contact on those connections.Brad"
2,Not for a serious Audiophile setup,"Dissapointing. The sping-loaded connectors at the back of the selector are not particularly strong, so thick or rigid cables under tension (e.g. twisted at odd angles) easily slip out. The depth of the connectors is also not great, so wires cannot be inserted very far to compensate for the lack of traction. Connections might be better using Monster Cables' own Angled Gold Pin connectors, but I didn't try those."
2,Not bad for the money,I am using this for an outdoor speaker setup including 4 sets of speakers on 3 separate outputs. The unit is a nice size and seems to be good build quality. The connectors are solid and I had no issues. My only complaint is that when I only have my zone 2 speakers selected there is still some output to the zone 3 speakers. Its very low volume but noticable.Since this is an outdoor setup its not a big deal for me but keep this in mind depending on your application.Update: After a year or so the unit now seems to play full sound over all three speaker pairs. I have to lower my rating for this.
2,18 gauge wire or thinner only,"I should have read what an earlier reviewer said. The spring loaded wire connectors in the back will not hold even moderately thick speaker wire. If you are using 18 guage or thinner (cheap) wire, this might work. If you are running thicker wire - like most higher end setups - it won't work. I use 12 gauge and 14 gauge speaker wire and couldn't even get the wires to go into the cheap connectors on the back of the unit. I return very few items, but had to return this one."
5,Works like a charm!,"It was the other feedback comments and reviews that pushed me over the edge and had me try this one out (vs some of the less expensive , but more questionable, options) and I couldn't be happier.I have a 20 year old Sony receiver which is still working like a charm and though it is currently has 2 zones as a primary feature, i wanted to be able to have 3 zones functional. Numerous places told me that i could add a device like this one but it would only allow me to specify one or the other zones, not letting them run concurrently. Wrong. This is a great device and i am putting it to the test these days. I have all three zones running and haven't experienced any issues!Great stuff."
4,Crank it up,one con the back connectors should be made to work with banana plugs for better connections and should fit 12 gauge wire. Aside from that it works great currently I run 6 speakers of it simultaneously without harming the amp it is fun to really crank up the volume.
3,It's fine,"Used for a long time. Replacing because I now need a unit that has volume controls, which this doesn't. It's very light, so get pulls around by weight of wires on the back. Works well though, for what it is. Same comment on others on small, cheap inputs on the back. But for a simple selector and thinner gauge wires, it's a good choice. Probably can get something else that does exactly the same for cheaper...Monster price. Materials are of good quality, though. Wish they put a weight in it do it stays put!"
4,Monster Cable SS4 Speaker Selector Box,"Item works as advertised. I have a Pioneer rack system in the house and have separate outdoor speakers out on my back deck. Wanted to have the simple option of selecting multiple speakers (A/B in the house, C outside). This item works great. The only thing I noticed as mentioned in a few other reviews that clips on the backside of the box are the cheaper blade style vs the push in clamps style found most electronic equipment. Overall this was a great investment and does as advertised."
3,Cardinal time,Have the clock in the rec area in the basement to go with the Cardinal theme. Hands on the clock are white and hard to see from across the room on the white ball background. Plastic construction seems cheap but it keeps time well.
1,S.O.L.,Don't know how it is. They sent me a AZ Cardinals clock instead. It was close to Christmas so I gave as a gift.
2,Not Really Dark Brown,"I bought Dark Brown color cause my hair is dark brown, but when I sprayed it on my scalp, it was more reddish than I expected, more like Dark Auburn than dark Brown. It covers a bit and it does hide the balding area by making the hair around thicker, but I hated the smell... It smells like cheap lotion, those with very strong scent!! Therefore, I will return this product."
1,GARBAGE rip off,"I bought the stuff for a 40th birthday joke, but if someone really thought that it would help hide their thinning hair they would be mistaken, the crap is the same color as pale skin making you appear even more bald. The seller was not cooperative when I wated to get a refund. AMAZON stepped in and made the refund, I will buy on AMAZON again but not this crap, and not from that vendor."
2,Cover,"Its ok I tried using it, it covers bald spots and also gets on everything in the room. So I guess if you want to clean up the whole bathroom after use this is for you."
1,Bad product,"This product did not spray ""blonde"" as it stated. The color it sprayed was like a whitish-brown! I was VERY disappointed when I got it & immediately returned it. I have ordered the Brown shade and that one is really good."
2,An almost amusing dinosaur-like relic from the fifties.,"It is common knowledge that John Wayne was gung-ho right-wing in his world-view, which doesn't help this cliche-ridden melodrama achieve any distinction. He goes to Hawaii to smash a subversive ""Commie"" ring. It is too bad the film wasn't in color, maybe we could have seen him socking it to people wearing red, subversive underwear. A nostalgic pot-boiler."
3,"not wayne's best,but to slander the man is just low!!!!!","in answer to the ""draft dodge"" question,when wayne was 39 years old in 1939(yes 39) he became a star in stagecoach.at the age of 42(yes 42) he was given a deferment because of his AGE and the number of children he had not because he was a coward.john ford a vet of world war II9he lost an eye) made many movies with wayne and wouldn't have had wayne been a coward.no the movies isn't very good but its ok when viewed as a time capsule,and thats it.wayne looking to stop a commie plot in hawaii is an action movie and propganda,nothing more.To call into question the honor and motives of a man like john wayne(who most of the world thinks of when you say american)is just wrong. this man did more for his country that most people ever do. no i don't think everything he belived in was right,but at least he stood up for what he thought and didn't attack people after they were gone and couldn't fight back."
2,no draft dodger here!,"John Wayne was no draft dodger as one of the previous reviewer(a left-wing moron) stated:As Wikipedia states:Wayne was 34 when the U.S. entered the war and was raising four children, and when he requested deferment he was granted a 3-A deferment for family reasons. Later in the war his deferment was changed to a 2-A deferment with the explanation that having him serve was not in the national interest. Despite not serving, Wayne did support the military through participation in USO shows for U.S. servicemen.I guess it would have been better if we had let the government take care of his children if he had perished in WWII? My grandfather also didn't serve in WWII because he had three children to raise including my father.LONG LIVE JOHN WAYNE!!"
2,Big Jim McWayne,"A rather old fashioned even for the fifties movie. Presents a rather simplistic view of world politics. This is more representative of Mr. Wayne's politics than of cinematic license. I am not a fan of the man's politics, but many of his movies(Red River, The Searchers)were classics, and as I age I realize there were many facets to his character. This particular movie is NOT one of best,however."
5,Great for the opposite reasons,"My name is Jim McLain, spelled the same way as in the movie. This said I'm here to tell you that this is a five star rating because I LOVE terrible movies! Sometimes I wish John Wayne hadn't used the rare spelling I do in my name. The Duke was running, yes RUNNING from the House of Unamerican Activities. James Arnes Gets bested by two little oriental guys who combined don't match his weight and beat him down hand to hand! More sermons than an Amish Convention. Great drunk late night viewing!"
3,John wayne duke,I think it was the way of life back then and i wish we had a little more of love for our country with us today. The movie is just about the time the {50s} that we was in and i like seeing the old cars and the great suits.. ha on the suits i got the movie and will see it many times more than jet......................
3,Big Jim McLain,This is not one of the best acted movies BUT it is an important movie. The communist scare IS STILL REAL; especially today! I was a little kid the first time I saw it & it is funny how this movie has stayed with me for 55 years. I still like it!
1,Don;t waste your time,don;t waste your time would not play on all 3 dvd players always wanted to see this movie very disapointed
3,Big Jim McLain,Interesting movie on anti-american worries after the end of WWII. Enjoyable movie in black and white like all john wayne movies should be.
1,xxx,"dvd is inoperable-something is bad-plan to send it back,,,couldn't watch it ,thought I would watch the rest of what I bought to see if there are any more bad dvd's"
3,This CD was good but did not live up to expectations,"Nicole's CD, ""Make It Hot"", was OK, but did not live up to it's blazing first single & title track. In other words Missy faked us all out. There should have been more songs produced by Timbaland and less interludes, which were boring, unnessacary, and in one case pointless. The songs Missy produced could have been better but were still good. The best songs on this CD have got to be ""Eyes Better Not Wander"", and ""Make It Hot"". Overall the CD could have been better."
3,"OK,Where is she today!?!!","Missy Elliot debuts Nicole a R & B singer who is 17 years old. Nicole struck gold with her single ''Make It Hot'', but there are no other songs that follow that same soultry formula. There is '' Seventeen'' but other than that, theres nothing else on this album that catch your ear. Its too bad that this LP had to be her only luck at stardom."
3,Where's Electric Blue? Where Are You?,"At the time this album dropped I was a sophmore in highschool. I loved her first single ""Make It Hot"" catchy hook and the dance moves to the video everybody and their momma was imitating. hehe. Anyhow, as for the album it was not consistent. The album wasn't a playthru album, not that the other tracks sucked it just wasn't my cup of tea. It was a lil' more leanient towards the R&B/Pop genre and it got on my nerves. Standout Tracks to me were ""Boy you should listen"", ""Silly Love Song"", ""Raise Your Frown"", ""Testing Our Love (Suga)"", ""Make it Hott"" and ""Seventeen""... over all this is a pretty solid album. I have been waiting and anticipating her sophmore album though titled ""Electric Blue"", because I seen the video and the song ""I'm Lookin'"" and I must say that this song is very mellow and smooth, plus the video was very cool and she's cute as a button. What happened to her? Anyhow, I suggest u cop this album used just in case u feel cheated...or download."
4,Nicole - Make it Hot 98,"She Still have her own Flava in this album, It's Different Than Any Seventeeen Old I've heard her words speak fire on this album. This Album is great the beats are different from other artist i listen to this album pretty every chance I get."
2,HER ALBUM IS NOT SO HOT,THE ONLY ALRIGHT SONG ON THE WHOLE CD IS MAKE IT HOT THE OTHER SONGS ARE WHACK! NICE TRY NICOLE BUT YOU GOTTA REALIZE IT AINT ALL THAT BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!
3,NOT ALL THAT,HER ALBUM AIN'T ALL THAT BUT IT'S SRTAIGHT EVEN THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE HIT US A LITTLE HARDER WHEN SHE FIRST CAME OUT. MAKE IT HOT LIKE FIRE WAS COOL BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. BUT SHE STILL APART OF MY #1 FAN CLUB.
3,Make it Hot and I Can't See are the best 2,"Missy sings a lot at the beginning of this CD. Nicole is alright.... ""Make it Hot and ""I Can't See are the best 2 songs on the CD. Some of the slow ones at the end are pretty good too."
4,MAD PHATT! AND ALL THAT,"this cd is Hot!Hot! as always Missy and Timberland are always making mad jump-hop grooves and cool beats together.The rythms and styles on this Cd are MAD PHATT! AND ALL THAT,their voices along with Nicole makes it all better.Nicole's new voice and personality adds a whole new view to the music and CD. Take my advice if you're a Missy and Timbaland fan ""BUY IT"" 'cause you're about to become a Nicole fan."
5,She's got it all,"Nicole Ray has it all; a bit of Brandy's wit, a bit of Monica's beauty, a bit of Mya's spunk, a bit of Tatyana's charm, and a bit of Aaliyah's moves. She has a lot going for her, reach for the stars, Nicole!"
2,Better without Missy,"I can't stand Missy Elliot. She always came off, to me, as more of a clown than a rap artist.The best thing she did for Nicole, was not ""rap"" on all of the songs.The three songs where she is present, would have been so much better, if she'd just let Nicole sing. I can't stand great R & B songs where a rapper, or a waanabe in this case, starts rapping halfway or throughout the song.I wanted to hear Nicole. If I had wanted a Missy Elliot album, I would have bought one.Over-all, I suggest you download the following songs from iTunes, and forget the rest.2. Seventeen9. Nervous11. Boy You Should Listen12. Eyes Better Not Wander14. Silly Love Song16. Borrowed Time17. Testing Our Love"
2,"MISSY,THOUGHT THIS WAS NICOLE'S ALBUM.","MY PROBLEM WITH THIS ALBUM IS THAT MISSY ELLIOTTIS ALL OVER IT,THAT RUINS THE ALBUM COMPLETLY.NICOLE HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A SEVERAL HIGHLIGHTSBUT OTHER THAN THAT THIS ALBUM SUFFERS."
3,Slept On,"Nicole's 1998 release was tight. It's a little ""teenagery"" at times, but she was 17. Her vocals are tight, and she's got the looks to match. What's up with her on the Roc?"
4,Another great one by Tim 'O Brien but not his best.,"The Nuclear Age is a compelling story about an overly paranoid man trying to find his way in a hostile world that he has trouble coping with. O'Brien, as usually, supports the text with great prose and interesting timelines. However, I recommend putting the book down twenty pages before it ends because it's not only anticlimatic but also lacks any hint of resolution."
3,Disappointing,"A man spends a lifetime worried about the bomb. Some parts were interesting - I liked the therapist that needed therapy the best, but mostly I felt the overall effect wasn't that interesting or funny. I suppose I was hoping for more true humor but found most of it just to be surrealistic in form and content."
4,Qualified,"This novel takes a look at how you would live your lifeif you were always cognizant of, and worried by, the threat ofextinction in a nuclear war. O'Brien treats this subject veryseriously, but the book is written in a comic style."
3,Frustrated by this one,"All of O'Brien's works leave the reader wonderfully exhausted from the mental exercizes which need to be done in order to appreciate his writing. However, unlike in ""The Things..."" and ""The Lake...,"" I had a much harder time understanding the characters, the symbolism, and what exactly it was that O'Brien was trying to say. Perhaps this is because The Nuclear Age is intended more for those who were alive at the time of the Cuban Missle Crisis and the Vietnem War. The Nuclear Age was enjoyable, but overall I frustrated that so much of it went over my head."
5,The Nuclear Age book,The vendor was very prompt and responsive to my request of cancellation due to late delivery.
2,It's OK if you haven't got anything else lying around.,"This is an alright book with pretty good prose. I think it would be good for someone in the 8th grade or those who wake up someday and realize that there are hostile people and governments in the world. As an aside, I read this book onboard a ballistic missile submarine..it was in the ship's library!"
2,Not his best...,"I consider myself a huge O'Brien fan. He is truly one of the most gifted story-tellers alive today. The Nuclear Age, however, failed miserably to live up to the excellent standards set by his other works. That said, it is by no means a bad book- just not the most captivating and engaging read. If you plan to read O'Brien's work, DO NOT START with The Nuclear Age. It doesn't do his talent justice."
3,Nice questions but personalities rather than discoveries,"A nice little book for the student who asks questions, by identifying unanswered ones for investigating. There is, however, an emphasis on personalities rather than the events and discoveries. A map of the expedition, sites and dates would have been helpful too."
2,"Good, but an old edition.","This book is the 3rd edition, so its old. Don't buy it if you are taking a cna program. There was no indication in the product info that this was the 3rd and not the 4th edition."
2,Not as I expect,"The cover of the book shows that the author is Bart Andrews with J Randy Taraborelli, author of a MJ's book Magic and Madness. This book is actually a blending of Magic and Madness, and the other half on Janet. If you have read the Magic and Madness, then you will definitely felt boring. This is a problem of same writer writing books for two singers from the same family. I think this situation should be avoided.Janet is surely a person to whom I have great interest. According to the writer, she is almost the only one that escaped from the madness of the family. How could she manage to do that? Only a book fully for her, not this one, can serve the purpose."
2,Not much to read,"I have read so many books on Michael to the point that I feel like I know him. I can not say the same about Janet. I'm actually surprised that there are virtually no books about Janet and her career, marriages, etc. This book was not very informative or maybe Janet is actually boring. With all the press about Michael Jackson and his estate I'm a little unnerved that Janet hasn't taken a more assertive approach in being more vocal about her brother's death and show support for her mother. What would it have taken for her to sit with her family at the Dancing with the Stars tribute. In the books I read about Michael as well as Latoya's book I really get a sense that Janet so wanted to carve a path for herself that it actually appears she is not a part of her family. Would someone write a more in depth book about this so-called Pop Icon. As of now I don't think she deserves the title."
3,Still Not Helpful If You Have Kids Under 3,"I read this in addition to ""Positive Discipline"" (see my review for that), because I was desperately looking for some advice on the 2-3 year old. Unfortunately, neither books addresses this age group. It seems if you have a ""terrible 2"" year old, you just have to wait it out until they reach 3 or 4, and then apply the rules of positive discipline. The concept of positive discipline is GREAT, but very hard to do. This book was not written as well as ""Positive Discipline"" was. It had way too many examples and not enough solutions. For example, the issues of hitting (kids hitting kids) is barely discussed. Basically, I think reading ""Positive Discipline"" is sufficient, and this book does not shed any more light, even though it claims to address preschoolers."
2,A Bit Too Liberal for Some Parents...,"If you're conservative, this book probably isn't for you. It's full of the old self-esteem curriculum you see so often in our public schools today. There are a few good ideas, but I found it dense and lecturing to parents. Overall disappointing..."
5,positive discipline......,This book was so informative and great to read. I found it very helpful during preschool on my parent co-op work days. I even now have imbedded this material into my head that i find myself doing it all the time. My children are less in time outs and more ready to share their feelings. this book is great. Even the parents at the Co-op have said they loved it. thanks.
3,Item not as good as reviews say,"I bought this to attempt an at home bikini wax and it did not work. I usually get them done and knowing I would not be as skilled I wanted to ease the pain. I FELT EVERYTHING! One review says be careful because wax can be too hot and you will not feel it, I want what she has because this is not it. I also have a prescription 5% cream and there is a huge difference."
5,Worth it!,"This product works. I have tried them all - pills, creams, promises. Nothing gave relief like LMX. I was considering surgery. Thank the Lord for this product. Just this and ibrophen and life is back to normal.5% is the way to go."
2,Didn't work,This is lidocaine and it burns when it is applied. I was looking for pain relief. OTC lanacaine from the drugstore worked better.
1,Did not work,"This cream did not work at all so it was a complete rip off for $30. I would not recomend it. I used it for laser hair removal, put it on 30 minutes before, absolutely no difference. My hair removal clinic gave me something 10x better to use."
5,Wow,I put this on an hour and a half before my session then wrapped it. I put it on again half an hour before and wrapped it again. I got my tattoo on my ribs and did not feel a thing for an hour
2,Not great for electrolysis,"Please note that this review is solely based on this product's effectiveness for electrolysis procedures only.I bought this product for electrolysis based on the excellent reviews, but it proved to be very ineffective. I would put two layers on approx. 30-40 mins before the procedure and saran wrap it. For the eyebrows, I honestly thought that it took away 10-15% of the pain at best. Same goes with the other parts of the body. And unfortunately, 10-15% is definitely not worth the high cost of this product. However, it does work fairly well for the upper lip, so if I were to base this review solely on electrolysis of the lip, I would give it 3.5 stars.If you're looking for a good numbing cream for electrolysis, I suggest Emla--the brand name. You have to get a prescription from your doctor to get it but it works better than this."
5,Super scary fun!!!,"This book holds all the excitement and horror thereis to find. If I were a chicken, I wouldn't read it.But if you're not, here's my dare!!"
4,Totally engrossing,"John Whitehead comes through as a real person with a not so promising background who emerges as a ""bigger than life"" Christian man. He truly makes one believe that with God all things are possible. Not only do we learn the truth about Paula Jones, but he also has met Clinton, Dobson, Jim Bakker, Jerry Falwell, Anita Hill, Pat Robertson, Randall Terry, etc, etc. And, though the book is not about her, I am equally enthralled with his wife, Carol. What a woman! She should write her own book about her life with John and how she perservered. You will be fascinated about John Whitehead's ""conversion story."""
2,las tablas de multiplicar,"it has just four songs, el abedecedario, las vocales brinca la tablita y las tablas"
3,WRONG GENRE,"Eric Carmen has a great voice, but was erroneously squeezed into the screeming rock.Maybe he put himself in that genre, thinking it most marketable. All By Myself was hauntingly beautiful revealing his unique vocal abilities. Had he had Josh Groban's trainer/manager he would have bowled me over with every song. To be fair, that could be me and my age."
2,So so...,"Bought this because I heard one song on the radio that I liked. The rest of the CD was mediocre at best. I think the word to use for this CD is ""schmaltzy""."
1,They get ONE star because there is no Zero,"These were just awful! We tried to give them away, but after one taste not one person liked them. I wish I could explain the flavor so anyone reading this could decide, but there is nothing to describe it. We ended up throwing them out."
5,The best Soda Album,"Soda Stereo is quite posibly the best Spanish Rock band that ever existed and this is, in my opinion, their best album. All songs but one made hit singles in my home country and they stayed in lists for over two years when combined. I even remember that at one time 6 of the 10 most played songs in radio stations came from this record. To this day, 12 years later, these songs play anywhere where there's people from Latin America and you see people singing along and jumping around. It is that good. One of those records that you always remember and cherish, not only for the music, which is exquisite, but for the great memories it brings back."
5,El mejor disco en la carrera de esta increíble banda,"Sin lugar a dudas, en este disco, Soda expone toda la creatividad y la pasión lograda en el punto más elevado de su carrera. Un disco en el que cada tema es un verdadero HIT. Tiene una onda totalmente coherente, de principio a fin y las melodías y los arreglos, así como también el sonido general del disco son insuperables. Realmente, lo mejor en la carrera de la banda de rock argentino de Gustavo Cerati y Zeta Bosio."
5,Simple and Powerful,"This a record that has not been out performed by any other latin band or Soda Stereo. In a way, it is the point of reference for many casual latin rock fans on Soda's music.The most striking aspect of this recording is how simple and straight foward these songs are. The instrumentation is perhaps the most guitar oriented in Soda's recording career. Zeta (bass) and Charly (drums) layed down a extremely solid foundation for Cerati's guitar to come foward. This recording offers a set of songs that have become standards for a Soda Stereo live performance such as the title track, De Musica Ligera, Hombre al Agua, Un Millon de años luz, etc.."
4,Fishing for what?,"This is a great movie. It's fun and entertaining from start to finish. Considering the time frame this movie was made, it must have been on the cutting edge with the soft, sexual content. It's a must-see for movie lovers of this era."
2,Film editor had a heavy hand!,"I wanted to love this movie...and had it in my Amazon shopping cart for several months, constantly shifting it from ""buy now"" to ""save for later"". The anticipation did not live up to the actual viewing experience!The editing of this film ""classic"" is akin to watching a movie on TNT. I constantly wondered, ""What was cut to allow for the extra 16 minutes of commercials?"" The Paula Prentiss character seemed to suffer the most at the hands of heavy editting, as I struggled to determine why she had a hate-hate-love relationship with the Rock Hudson character, or why he responded the way he did.This was certainly not the comedic romp I was so higly anticipating, and will probably never have another showing in this house."
2,Too long,"I agree with the reviewers who didn't care for this picture. Besides the other criticisms listed here, this movie was too long [120 minutes]. Given the type of comedy this is, I thought the funniest character was John Screaming Eagle, Chief of the Chattahoochie [sp?] Tribe."
5,Mans Favorite Sport DVD,Another romance I remember seeing in my teen years. Had to order it when I saw it. Paula Prentiss and Rock Hudson are great together.
4,Man's Favorite Sport,Rock Hudson at his comedic best. Love the story line and all the characters. Good addition to my oldies collection.
5,Fun Movie,"I haven't seen this movie since it came out in 1963. It makes me laugh every time I watch it. Rock Hudson was so sweet in this movie. He truly was a beautiful man. They don't make movies like these any more. It's simple, fun and entertaining."
5,Great,"This is a funny, funny movie. I laughed at the fishing scenes especially, been there, done that. We need good stories like these again."
3,Mans' Favorite Sport,"Typical Rock Hudson -- goofy, love story, and just plain fun. I'd seen it years ago and just wanted it for my collection."
3,Boring and silly formula movie,"I will admit to enjoying this slow movie when it came out over 40 years ago, but I was a young man then and it was up on a big screen. On the DVD I still enjoy Paula Prentiss' character and her great performance but Rock Hudson is a poor substitute for Cary Grant. Hudson was much better in Pillow Talk, which I think is mainly due to a better script. This script is just too silly and slow for an adult. For an old comedy that holds up well try Pillow Talk and/or Bringing Up Baby. The widescreen is nice, the picture and sound clear but bonus feature amounts to only the original trailer."
4,Delightfully Trance,This CD is awesome. I havent heard as good of a CD since I picked up Dj Kimball Collins Club Nights. Dj Psycosis did a great job. I love the melodies and the phat beats. I want to hear more!
1,Not the book shown,"I can't comment on the quality of ""Texas (From Sea to Shining Sea)."" I can only say that if you are looking for the book pictured, this isn't it. The book pictured is published by Scholastic and is part of the America the Beautiful series. That's the one I wanted and I ordered this by mistake."
5,El Tigere sabe de bachata...mierkinaaa,"Saludando el mundo, como le va....oye esta produccion de el nonito de tamboril ta en fuego! La cancion ""desde nino"" me pone pensar cuando yo tenia 12 y 13 ano y no tenia lo cojone pa hablarle a esa tipa... ta cabron eso pero na... Que viva Zacarrias y la buena musica de Republica Dominicana...un saludito a mi gente de Santiago y la Vega, lo veremo pronto encendio!!!Salud! cantinero sirvame otra copa. - el Neii"
2,Not much worth watching,"This is not a very high quality product. A smattering of Olympic footage which just leaves you wanting more, and then 20+ minutes of abysmal Detroit propaganda films from the 60's. Kinda funny to see, but not recommended unless you are searching for ""old sound bytes"" for a DJ compilation or something like that, in which case the Detroit footage has some pretty good ""1950's voice"" type stuff."
5,"Not a review, a question","Would someone be able to answer a question for me...i have 4 sets of speakers in various rooms in my house, installed in the ceiling. Would I be able to hook this switcher up to a receiver in order to get my speakers working?"
2,"Only Single Input, not what the manual shows","Before buying this I downloaded the manufacturer's manual from their website [...] The pictures show that this device has 2 left\right inputs, for your front and back channels. It only has one ! so be careful. So it's basically one-input to six-outputs, so it may be good for an old stereo but not for a home theatreI didn't even test it since it wasn't what I needed, so I can't judge the quality of the device."
5,Works Fine,"I looked at all available switchers and this was inexpensive relative to most others. I was therefore a little apprehensive. I switch 5 speaker pairs with the unit. It works great, easy to install, would recommend it."
5,Monster 6 Speaker Selector,"Heavy Duty . Well Built. Must use speaker pins to hook speaker wire to the selector. 3 polk c speakers inside 3 outside. Sound is great reguardless of how many on at one time. All speaker selectors are not the same. Have one from Radio Shack and the music highs n lows would suck and the more speakers used, well you know, more sucking.Monster Cable SS-6 Speaker Switcher for 6 Pairs of Speakers"
5,Well made. Works great.,"It's a good quality speaker selector - not sure what else to say. I used it with 14ga inputs and 16ga to all the pairs of speakers. Cramming the 14ga into the terminals took some well... cramming. Other than that it works great. Had used the 4-port version of this for about three years without issue. Replaced it with a Pyle PSS8 and was very disappointed - the unit would clip the receiver if you barely turned up the volume. The Monster SS6 was a great fix - replaced it and everything worked without issue - running the 7th pair off the receiver ""B"" channel. Overall it's a great unit - good compact form factor and sturdy metal case."
1,Who's Prosperity??,"If your'e into keeping narcissistic cult-leaders driving expensive cars & cruising the French Riveiera, this book is for YOU! I followed this nut for 7 years until he escaped prosecution to Florida (go ahead & Google him). The wrap sheet should be soon a better sell than this book."
5,Wonderful Old Recipes,"I bought this second hand because I remembered the cover from my Mother's kitchen. We moved to Alaska in 1973 when the frontier spirit was still very much alive.My edition is the ""Eighth Printing 1976 Revised Edition"". It still has recipes for whale roast and moose nose soup in it. It also have recipes for ""End of the Garden Pickle"" and no less than five pie crust recipes. I'll be trying some of these out and blogging them!"
2,Beware!,"J. Kemp, Brig. Gen., USAFR McLaughlin's experiences in WWII were truly epic; however, the lack of detail in his written account and his modesty in revealing his contributions and bravery during the AIR Bombing Campaign over Europe understates and limits the reader's ability to better comprehend the conflict. I would rate this book as ""One Star"" for older readers, but I think younger readers (7th, 8th and 9th Grade) may find the book a helpful primer. If you are a serious reader of WWII History avoid this book."
5,Works well,"Used for window exterior wood repairs. A little messy and set fast (warm day). But I mixed it up on a cardboard sheet and used wood shims to mix and spread, but it does harden stronger than the wood it replaced. Can be sanded and painted. This repair is going to last longer than the wood around it."
3,Pretty good!,I really enjoy it. But you have to be aware that Emanuel wrote concerning at his time! Sometimes isn't easy to understand...
3,Mystic or Maniac?,"I read the entire book, and still wonder whether the author, Emanuel Swedenborg, really had those dreams, or whether he had a brain tumor which made him imagine them. Anyway, his descriptions of heaven and hell leave out a couple of important points concerning the atonement, a real resurrection for all mankind, and judgment day. He has some very strange understandings of heaven and hell. But the book also made me think of some things which I had never before considered. It was thought-provoking to me, and may be severely confusing to other readers. I will try another of his books, to see if I can find some more nuggets of truth among the ramblings."
1,Not a good book,"Not a good book. Difficult to follow, difficult to understand. It's fiction and not to be believed. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Biased,The book is biased into a polarized view of the spiritual world. It continues the current construct of evil and goodness. It is a not so subtle indoctrination.
1,Eternally Lost!,"This author is cleary reaping what he sowed. Just another man who tried to change the gospel to suit his lifestyle. Highly intelligent no doubt, so much so that he thought he was too smart for God. What a shame. If you want to know about the real Heaven & Hell open up your bible and study."
1,insensate drivel,"This book is a collection of arbitrary ""observations"" by Swedenborg on the nature of creation, the structure of Heaven & Hell, and the soul. While there are some interesting ideas here, they are very few & far between, and the object of the book seems to be not to enlighten but to comfort. I would rescind this review in a heartbeat, and give him the five stars I'd like to, if a single thing he said was verifiable; but as it turns out, most of the book is in direct contradiction to simple logic.Instead, I recommend reading something that will provide a toolkit for the establishment of the insight necessary for personally verifiable results, like Vivekananda's Raja yoga, or any meditation manual, at all, ever. Not this turgid, puerile work that even it's own preface suggests be placed in Airport bookstores."
3,How to belive this? No animals or other Creation?,"I have read several of Swedenborg's works and was charmed by the ideals. The visions of the conversations in beautiful gardens are lovely. The hells are plausible. However the gardens must be silent ones. The gardens mere mirages. Swedenborg is highly human-centric and gives animals short shrift indeed. They are merely ""souless beasts"" that when dead are just that. Dead. No animals, no plants and long winded human converstions forever are my ideas of pure hell. That said, there is much good in the ideas presentd by Swedenborg and they are very profitable reading, the ideas of service should be acted upon. Those who have had near death experiences will be able to relate well. I suppose that if indeed he did have these experiences he was in his ideal of heaven. However heavens that do not include all of God's creation are sadly incomplete indeed."
5,Our concept of God shapes our concept of life,"One of Swedenborg's first statements in this work is: ""First and foremost, we need to know who the God of heaven is, since everything else depends on this."" This statement blows me away with its simplicity, truth, power, and applicability. Our concept of God shapes our entire concept of life, relationships, and self. This book is a stunning introduction to a loving God who strives in everyway to lead people to Heaven. Reading this book is a breath of fresh air, truly a new christianity. If you want to find out more about Swedenborg, his works, check out www.newchurch.org and explore ""The New Church"" a church founded on the teachings of the Old and New Testaments and the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg."
5,Start Here,"If you are interested in Swedenborg, I would start here, with this beautifully written peek into to what happens after you die. Concrete, gorgeous imagery, and poetic vistas weave a complete and transcendent view of heaven and hell. This translation, (from the original Latin) is beautifully wrought and a pleasure to read."
4,Does the job.,"This strap is designed to slip over the positive and negative battery posts. With a battery that arc'ed out, and burned out the positive battery post, I had to find an alternate method to lift the battery."

3,"Good overview of linguistics, but often too detailed.","This textbook will give students a thorough overview of linguistic anthropology, but is often ""dry"" and long-winded. While the basic information is interesting and enlightening, the details are what detracts from what otherwise is a good text. Some of the information covering obscure languages and/or cultures goes into such lengthy detail that it's worth skipping over and getting to the subject matter that really pertains to the subject you're studying. As with many textbooks, the instructor may have had no choice in which book to use. In any case, if you have to buy this book, do so...but be prepared to skim over the chapters first and find what is pertinent to your individual class/instructor and what you need to know. I can only generously give this textbook three stars."
4,Great Idea,"Anatopsis is kind of a strange book. The beginning seems a little long and the ending seems a little short. The characters are interesting, but lack a level of depth. They seems to have no introspection at all. I know this is a young adult novel, but that really is not an excuse. For that reason it is a cute book with an interesting premise, but nothing more."
1,Campy Cheerleading Flick,"If you like watching cheerleaders, then this might be the ticket for you; however, Bring it On was much more entertaining.The movie has a weak plot about a girl who infiltrates a cheerleading squad for a newspaper story. This is the kind of movie that you watch at 3:00 a.m. on Cable TV when you can't sleep. I have a sneaking suspecion that this movie did not last long on the screen. The only real star in the movie is Collene Camp, who could be called one of best B movie queens (I think this was one of her first movies). However, even she could not bring life to this bad movie."
3,Cool but Fake,I bought this ring for my girlfriend and she likes it a lot but she realized that the pearl is fake! It failed the tooth scratch test and it looks like shiny paint or some shiny thin layer is being scratched off the surface. If it is real its been sprayed with something to make it shinnier.
1,Can't keep time ....,"Though the 'quality' of the clock looks good, the clock loses anywhere from 2-4 hours each day in keeping time, even with fresh batteries."
5,Beautiful tea pot,It arrived on time and in perfect shape. The pot is thicker and the flowers more beautiful than I expected.
1,GARBAGE SAVE ONE!,"Both THE BEING and CREATURE FROM THE ABYSS are a complete waste of time and money. The latter is so bad I was forced to fast forward it just to get through it. THE DARK, however, has merit and a good cast with William Devane, Kathy Lee Crosby, Keenan Wynn etc and is worth giving it a watch. Save money and buy THE DARK instead of being saddled with the other two losers."
3,ok to kill time,"From what I saw I can say the movies must of been low budget. I guess all that can be said is that they were great to kill a few hours. There were times of suspense, Times of biting your nails, And a few scary times in these movies. But thats just my own feelings. Im sure the reviews will vary from person to person."
3,Not as good as I was expecting,"Hello,I bought these because I remember them as teenager. I wish that I had passed them over. Cheesy and pretty laim. This is only my opinion, but that is what these things are for.Thanks."
2,disappointing for poor PC interface,"The device works well enough, but I am disappointed it is not a continual feed, and some of the info must be dug out from several menu layers.The primary disappointment for me is that the units requires a SERIAL port to communicate with a PC. A SERIAL PORT? What is this 1985? Come on guys - get to the age of USB - or even better - wireless. Serial port? You must be joking.Even worse - the directions specifically say that it WILL NOT WORK WITH A SERIAL TO USB ADAPTER - and I have found that to be correct.The software leaves much to be desired as well.If I were to do it again... I wouldn't"
2,Poor quality sensors,"I have had this weather station for 2 1/2 years. Last fall the wind sensor went bad, as I have noticed is about average. This spring the temperature/humidty/transmitter went bad. For the price I paid and the reputation of La Crosse I expected better."
5,"Great value, not just for cars",I used this for my home stereo to connect a preamp to a power amp. These cables sound great and they are well made. The single cable that holds both channels is a nice feature. Many audiophiles would probably laugh at me for thinkning these are good cables. If these were packaged under monster's home line then they would probably be $50 more.
5,clean and clear sound,"I bought this product in hopes of reducing background noise and it definitely worked. I get beautiful sound. At first I thought that my amp was bad.Before I changed to Monster interconnects, I was getting bad noise when, for example, the fog lights were on or the air conditioning was on high. Talk about embarrassing when you're trying to show off and its hot outside. So I quickly changed to Monster 202 and 204 LN Audio Interconnects and problem solved.A very tight fit as well, great connectors.Don't waste money with other products; go with Monster the first time, every time.-Keven"
5,MALTIN IS THE BEST,"Leonard Maltin's book is always next to my chair, so thatI can read his review before deciding to give 2 hours ofmy life to watching a movie. I always agree with hisopinions, I think because Maltin REALLY LOVES film, andis so very knowledgable about them. He never gives a badreview because movies bore him; I feel that it is with aheavy heart that he rates a movie as poor. Every year Ibuy his updated version."
2,Kindle version is a challenge...,"I haven't looked at the print version, but the Kindle version is challenging. The titles are arranged alphebetically. You have to ""next page"" quite a bit to find what you're looking for. If you want to use the search function to find a title it's hit or miss. For example searching for the title ""Them"" turns up over 400 hits. But searching for the title ""Trog"" gave 1 correct hit."
4,"""Too Long"" Leonard?","While this book remains the staple of movie buffs everywhere, in the 2004 edition, I get the sense that Maltin is growing weary. Either that or he's growing too old for sitting and watching movies. Why? Well, in review after review it seems he makes some comment about movie length. Even in good movies that he's given high ratings too there are so many references to him complaining that the movie ""goes on too long"", including both ""Harry Potter"" movies (hey, they have to stay true to the books!), as well as ""Holes"" (come on, Leonard!), any James Bond movie, and a handful of others. Nonetheless, if you have only one film reference book in your library, this should be the one."
1,For Kindle Readers not a bargain,Why the hell anyone would spend $7.19 for a book that is already 7 years out of date is beyond me. Where is the current edition for Kindle?
3,At least it's better than Roger Ebert's book.,"Compared to Roger Ebert Movie's Yearbook, Leonard Maltin's book is better in terms of film reviews and ratings. He is much smarter than Ebert though. I quite enjoy his brief reviews."
1,Bag of Sha 2003,"Let's drop the average for Lenny's book a notch for his panning of the great movie Kingpin, which does have heart, contrary to what this buffoon says. It seems that all of Lenny's taste is in his mouth.Bah.Save you pennies and visit some online dvd-review sites as well as reading other customer views, it will certainly be more comprehensive."
5,FOR 25 YEARS,"I've been a regular buyer of MALTIN's book for many years.I usually buy it after my old copy wears out.I remember when LEONARD's only competitor was STEVEN SCHEUER who also had an annual guide.Nowadays,books of this type are legion.It is hard to put on the market a book like this for many reasons:taste is such a personnal thing;everyone's opinion can match a film critics most of the time.I admire MALTIN for persisting every year with a new édition.You may contest some of his reviews,but this guy sincerly love movies and wants you to do the same if possible.Imagine the time you save by skipping the bad movies.Thanks LEONARD.Keep on coming back to us and don't forget the FRENCH movies."
2,"Very, very poor","I sometimes cycle through this guide for a laugh. Maltin is a horrible film critic and a total historian - basically meaning that any film predating 1960 MUST be given 4/4 (unless it's really mediocre which, according to him, is rare). However he didn't hesitate to give BATMAN AND ROBIN 2.5/4 and TAXI DRIVER 2/4.He also gave THE BLADE MASTER, one of the worst films ever created, 0.5/4, yet he's given some truly decent films ""turkeys.""I'd rather read a video guide by Ebert because unlike Maltin, Ebert doesn't judge different films of different genres of various years against each other. He's pretty fair. Maltin is not."
1,Over the hill,"Leonard Maltin is too old for any modern movie lover. Can't seem to appreciate that movie making has changed (SOMETIMES for the better) in the last 50 years or so. Try the videohound movie guide for better assesments. Significantly less scholarly but much more fun and will actually help you find movies that you will like (that's the real point, isn't it?)"
3,What is up with the recording quality?,"I downloaded the songs and really liked them, but I was getting really crummy audio on my computer so I assumed that I had gotten a hold of some bad files. I went ahead and bought it anticipating a much fuller sound on my home stereo. Wrong. And I have some nice Paradigm speakers, a quality Amp, and a pretty nice Rotel CD player. There simply is no excuse for a recording this bad. If they are going for lo-fi, they ended up with much worse, and unprofessional - something that sounds as muffled as the recordings I made on the radio using my boom box when I was a kid. The Strokes managed to score a ""lo-fi"" sounding album with their first, so it isn't too hard.What a shame. These songs could really reveal some sonic detail with the right recording. I'm in a strange position here. I REALLY can't recommend buying this disc if you expect any semblance of modern recording quality standards. If you ONLY care about the music, go for it. Wow, I'm not sure what to think."
3,Not sure what this is,"I generally like music that is unique but I'm not sure what this is. The vocals are not clean enough. Either the singer is not very strong or there is too much emphasis on effects. Either way, the vocals strike me wrong. I also think the music is all over the place. There's definately some interesting songs and quality music, but it seems to lack a strong identity. I've given it three good listens and I find that I want to fast forward too much."
2,Start with the other three albums,What happened here? The music lacks the psychedelia and quirkiness of the first three albums. This album is far less catchy then previous releases.
3,Not their best but,"Ahhh...much love for the (lamentably not currently together) duo of Bitch and Animal. I much preferred their two previous releases-Eternally Hard and What's That Smell. However, there are still some worthy tracks on this release. ""Pac Man"" is a sweet unique lovesong, ""1/2 Naked"" and ""Feminist Housewives"" are both hilarious and ""Secret Candy"" is a brilliantly comedic feminist response to misogyny in rap lyrics. The rest of the songs were too self-consciously artsy for my taste. These are, however, two women with an articulate perspective and beautiful voices so I don't mean to discourage anyone from delving into their catalogue; an album that is not up to their usual standard is still quite good. If they ever tour together again, definitely make a point to go see them as they are at their best live."
4,It would be five stars if.....,"In fact, I'd like to rate it as 4 and a half stars for this DVDs set. The reason why it didn't get 5 stars from me is because the game 7 (1988 semi-final) I got was not really completely, it didn't included the first minute of the game, and in the end of the game, it also missed about 10 seconds. However, it didn't really missed the famous duel between Bird and Wilkins. But still, it would be really nice if I can get a ""completely"" game. And from some of the previous reviews, it looks like I was just unlucky to get the incomplete one (or the faulty one).But it's really a great DVDs set for all the basketball fan, since it doesn't really matter you love/like Larry Bird (or Celtics) or not, he is a ture legend, and you should own one if you really enjoy the basketball game."
4,Nice documentary but too short.,"I am a great Celtics fan from Eastern Europe. This was a great chance for me to see some of all-time games in full (also bought Boston Dynasty pack).I was bitterly disappointed when I realized that this was edition was relised in 1991 and that there are just few interview footage inserted in almost 15 years old material.Documentary ends somewhere in 1988 and there is nothing about back injury, Olympic games 1992 and the Dream Team, coaching of Indiana and the Coach of the Year Award.I have bought by Amazon two of Larry's autobiographies and red them. In the film there is nothing about Larry's personal life, about his first marriage and daughter Carry and nothonh about his second wife.OK there are 3 full games in this package what make this deal well worth of buying."
4,Good but could have been better,"This DVD is the same as the VHS version or very similar. I have seen the VHS version and is almost the same. It lacks more interviews with Larry Bird and it fails to tell what Larry is doing now.It gives a history of his life but i thoutht the NBA could have added more. I have the Bulls dynasty as well and it has more interviews and game by game and I am sure the Jordan DVD has that and more, Larry is in the same league and is a player of the same calibre as Michael.On the plus side it has 3 of Larry Birds best games one where he scores 60 points against the Atlanta Hawks so this is what makes this dvd a great collectors edition more than the footage on his life.Overall I would recommended to people if they want to buy it but for a 25 Anniversary edition I thought the NBA will include more."
4,"Es bueno, pero creo que le falta mas documentacion","Es verdad Larry Bird ha sido uno de los mas grandes basquetbolistas de todos los tiempos, este DVD muestra algunas facetas de su grandiosa historia, sin embargo, creo que este DVD quedo corto en comparación con la serie de Michael Jordan, el cual está mejor documentado y tiene mayor informacion que el mismo Larry. Sobre los juegos que tiene incluidos, no son los mas notables que fueron vs. los L.A. Lakers y vs. los Pistones de Detroit. Sobre el Dream Team de Barcelona 92 no viene informacion. En general puedo decir que es un buen video para quien no conoce a Larry, pero creo que para ser de colección le falto información."
3,Ripped off,"The DVD set is cool, but the one I got had the same cd in it twice. It was the game against Portland and the game against the Hawks. It was too late for me to return it because I didn't watch it until a month or so later."
1,terrible customer service,this is day 10 now and im still waiting for my package!!!!!!amazon seems great but when something goes wrong they run like chickens!However.....LARRY BIRD IS THE MAN AND DONT EVER FORGET THAT!
2,"Good idea, but not for 6 year olds","This is a great game for learning to count money quickly, but my 6-year old finds it difficult and not very fun. I am going to keep looking for a better game for her."
4,disign pocket book,fun pocket book with lots of pictures of 20th century disign items ranging from tea kettles to entire concept rooms. great to thumb through.
2,It's a dud!,"My four year old picked this out. (yeah, I know it says five and up but it's a sprinkler!! how complicated can it be!!!!) It won't stand up no matter where you put it, and it needs to to use it right. You need to fill this lttle tiny base with water and it's just not enough to make it stand. And then the hose attachment leaks. Not worth it!!"
4,Cool toy but.......,This toy is great fun when it works. Putting petroleum jelly on the conections solved our pipe flying appart problem. The base should be heavier but reducing the warter pressure solves this. I do not like a toy to have this many problems straight out of the box but it is fun with the bugs worked out.
3,Pretty Good,"Paul Rogers is without a doubt the best singer in Rock music!Unfortunately the Band on this this DVD let him down. Well not the whole Band, A great rhythm section of Bass & Drums but the lead guitar of Howard Leese from Heart is sadly lacking, the guitar sounds something akin to a bee buzzing around in a tin can. Following Mick Ralphs and particulary Paul Kossoff is a big ask but I've seen guys in bar bands make a better fist of playing this material!That aside it's always great to hear Paul Rodgers sing his old classics..."
4,Paul Rogers Old and New,"I've watched this DVD a couple of times since I got it.It is a great mix of the good 'ol songs we all grew up with, coupled with some newer stuff which is the same excellent music"
5,Listen loud !,"About Paul Rodgers it isn't necessary talk about. The man writes and sing since 1968. Free, Bad Company,etc.I want to talk about the excellent video quality.I want to talk about the excellent sound of the drums played by a furious drummer.I want to talk about the excellent sound of the two guitars, played by two guitarrists with a difference in themages that I suppose is over 30 years. They rock!I want to talk about the sound of the bass who could be increased in the mix, but it is ok.Just listen this concert loud. Hard rock-blues on the stage. Almost perfect.OBS: My equipment is an old but great Aura Amplifier with 66 watts each canal and a pair of Pure AccousticsPróxima speakers. All analogic, no equalizer, no controls. You can only increase the volume in the amplifier. Thisamplifier shows what it receives. And it received a lot of sound from this Blu-ray."
5,Just Great,"There's not much I can add that hasn't been said. I agree the mix could be a little better here or there on this particular DVD but that's a nit-pick because overall it's better than most. More importantly- Paul Rodgers has taken care of himself over the years, and he has ""iron pipes"" - the genetic gift of being able to sing at full throttle night after night for decades and still having your full range and great sound. Rodgers is an effortless performer. Paul has the pipes of a kid but the soul of a performer with decades of experience. Very few singers from that era remain standing at anything close to that level - let alone getting better with age--- Rock Steady!"
5,Awesome,"Tata Young shows once again that the most beautiful things in this world come out of Thailand, whether it be people or arts."
4,Pretty good book,A good book on perspective. It can be a little wordy sometimes but overall offers up good concepts.
3,i got this book a couple of weeks ago and haven't used it,this book is not a real help to me and proably wouldn't be a real help to anyone at all the techniques are very primitive and confusing and the tips are useless
4,Entertaining but...,"I bought this book since I was interested in creating my own comic book for my amusement.I found the format quite engaging and entertaining, pretty much like Scott McClouds Understanding Comics (whom the author's format is inspired by). The explanations are pretty straightforward and user-friendly, especially for the general introduction and one point perspective.Personally, I wish that it had more examples for implementing three point perspective (which is heavily used in the more dramatic/dynamic shots and scenes).Overall, it's a pretty good book, although I'm now purchasing other perspective manuals to clarify some of the more difficult aspects of this."
1,waste of time,"Buy ""How to draw comics the Marvel Way"" instead, as Stan Lee and John Buscema cover all the necessary points in a few pages, as opposed to wasting your money on a book like this. Although kudos to this guy for padding a book this size. He must be close with Scott McCloud."
3,not as accessible as hoped,"I bought this book at the recommendation of Scott McCloud but was disapointed in its accessibility. I have basic drawing techniques but have never attended an art school or had a very formal art class. This led me to be very confused at times over the principles that Chelsea was describing, i would re-read and re-draw what i believed he was saying but still never felt too comfortable with anything he detailed beyond one point perspective. I enjoy learning comic principles in a comic form but i just wasn't as pleased with its accessibility as i had hoped. So if your just starting to draw this probably isn't the perspective book for you."
4,You will gain perspective,"This book is excelent! Chelsea has found a way to teach complicated subjects (like three-point perspective and human figure) without being too technical. Some parts of the book are a bit complicated, though, but the author himself tells that ""There is an easier way"". The comic book language is ideal to explain perspective."
3,cartonon perspective,"this is a good book, but for the beginner who is interested in drawing comics in perspective i would recommend vanishing point by jason cheeseman-meyer. I seemed to go to that book more often while doing my practice drawings."
5,Latino Soul,"I speak only ""poqito"" Espanola but you need not know a word to be lifted up and into the classic soulfullness of Bolero music. And Tania Libertad is THE singer of the Bolero style. Not well known-or promoted up here in the USA, Tania will take your breath away with her incredible singing-and I must repeat- her Soul Singing. If you can find her recordings grab them."
5,Lot's of Fun,This book is a lot of fun and the directions are easy to understand. I never made balloon animals before and I was immediately making all sorts of them with ease.
5,"MORE ""BANG "" FOR YOUR BUCK","I AM NEW TO TWISTING. I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY INFORMATIVE. WITHIN MINUTES I WAS MAKING DOGS, CATS, HATS ETC. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, AND I PAID FULL PRICE FOR IT."
5,Stick to the review!,"The last reviewer seems to have forgotten we are reviewing the book, not trying to defame the author. What Swami Kriyananda has or has not been doing is irrelevant to this book. I hope the reviewer has at least read some of the Swami's latest books, to see if he is still copying his Guru.This book came at a time when I was having some misgivings about the direction SRF was heading. I had never heard of Donald Walters or Kriyananda, so when I was given the chance to buy the book, I jumped at it. The stories he tells about the great Master are beautiful, I can read the love for Yogananda in every sentence. I also learned about Ananda, and what they were doing; I eventually became a member. Ananda is like the church that gives freedom in worship while SRF is like The Vatican!Don't listen to the hate and gossip mongers, read this and other of Kriyananda's works; you won't be sorry."
2,Inadequate insights into MM,If you're tempted to buy this book for insights into Marilyn Monroe by her third husband you will be disappointed. There's way too much to their relationship he excludes. By the time he wrote it she had become an icon and he an old man probably looking for a few extra dollars. You can do better elsewhere.
4,Cold-Blooded Entertainment,"Not for the PC reader, this novella exposes the delightful sleaze in all of us and appeals to readers who enjoy stories where no one comes out clean. A cold woman and two slimy hustlers take this kid for all that he's worth. A must read."
5,Slide Magic,When I listen to this Album (Get Wild) I can't sit still at all. My toes are tapping & my fingers are snapping! This is definately a Great CD.
1,i didnt know it wasnt the actual book,"i bought this book thinking it was the actual text book, but it was really just the study guide. i had to go out and buy the real book from school for 100$."
4,utility radio,This was given as a gift and the person that received it really likes it very much. It's used out in the yard area and gets the stations in well and is sturdy enough to withstand mild weather conditions. Not sure if she'd want to leave it out in the rain or not however.
2,5 stars for Nat King Cole 2 stars for this.,"Nat King Cole is the most beautiful and expressive popular vocalist in history. Period. His piano is also a must. He's first rate there too. This isn't a good set of his classics. You want the ""Nat King Cole"" ""Masters"" box set. This isn't a good set of his singles. There are many other songs on it and many singles are missing. There are [still!] no CDs of all his singles. The songs not on other CDs could have fit on part of one CD. I don't know why they did this thing. I don't know about anyone else, but I'd also like to hear his real voice without all the digital monkeying. The music is the point that matters, so I'm sorry to tell you the criticism I'm seeing is on the mark. I guess people are finally noticing these record people fiddled around to long. Don't you bother. Pray for a real single set. Get Nat King Cole. Other CDs of Nat King Cole. You'll love and cherish them. The King rules."
1,bad sound quality !!!,"I agree with many reviewers in that the sound quality of this set is HORRIBLE! I listened to it using highend headphone, which is very revealing, and it is unbearable -- the hiss and static noise is very noticeable and the songs are in mono:-(DON'T buy this collection!"
5,Simply A Great Book,"I picked up this book to browse through it at a friend's home... and enjoyed it so much I got directly online to order my own copy! Wonderful conversation starter and people of all ages can enjoy it, I would definately recommend it."
4,"Good, but could be better","The overhang of the remaining portion of the net when it is folded over to capture an insect is not very long -- about three inches only. The rigid aluminum frame was crudely cut, with the cut on the handle not even at right-angles and with rough edges. Screw holes similarly rough and unfinished. Cheap but crude. You get what you pay for, I guess."
5,Great net - sturdy - huge!,"The other reviews are correct, you do need to get your own handle, but we found one that worked great.I was tired of buying those $1-$5 nets at the stores and they break in like a week or two. My son is 6 and is really into bugs, so we go through a ton of bug nets. This one is great - it's huge - you really could catch a small animal in it and it is sturdy.I'm so glad I bought it - it's great quality and a great price! I'm so done with buying the cheap plastic ones. This one is metal - kinda reminds me of a net you use at the pool to skim the water.All his friends and neighbors love it too!"
5,Great net and value.,"I purchased this net for my brother who is something of an insect nerd. He is thrilled with this net because of the sturdy materials and construction; in addition to the large diameter and deep net. In my opinion, the best feature of this net is its LACK of a handle. I shopped around before making this purchase and the other comparable nets had relatively short wooden handles which looked like they could not be removed (the descriptions were vague). Being able to add a long handle is a must for my brother. An exceptional value for the price!"
4,Very nice net,"This is a very nice net. The 15"" diameter makes it quite easy to catch insects on the wing. It is also quite durable. I have used it as a sweep net in some tall grass quite successfully as well. Even with the abuse of sweeping through the grass for nearly an hour, I cannot find a single snag in the mesh. As for the handle, I found a broken mop and was able to place the part of the mop that the handle screwed into in the handle of the net so that it can receive a detachable handle. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is the length of the net. When I flip the net to trap the insect inside, the overhang is quite minimal and if said insect is not at the very bottom of the net when I flip it, it will escape."
4,net,The net is a nice item but the packaging could be improved. The net came in a clear plastic bag without any other protection for the net.
2,Do I Really Need a Net without a Handle?,"I had butterflies eating my garden to the point of having plant skeletons rather than lush greenery. Not wanting to foul the environment , I decided that catching the butterflies would be the appropriate solution. Thus, I ordered and promptly received this butterfly net.Yes, it's clear from the picture that this net comes without a handle.And, yes, I understand that the error was mine in expecting a butterfly net to have a handle.So, I'll accept the responsibility for the handleless net. And for the 30 minutes it took me to find a handle that would more or less fit this net.However. . .my net had a rip in it that had obviously been repaired before mailing it out, making my net a second rather than first quality product.Add to that the fact that the net was mailed in a flimsy cellophane covering, no box, no protection whatsoever for the net.I am not a happy camper."
1,"Big net, big dissapointment","Not to beat a dead horse, but I was surprised and disappointed to find that the net DOES NOT come with a handle. Seems like that ought to be clearly stated in the product description. The low-quality packaging provides no protection, so be prepared for a warped net. While the net is big, it is very hard to catch (and keep) something since the net does not close over. There were many inexpensive nets to choose from when I was shopping, and I am sorry I picked this one. More work (fashion your own handle and try to get packaging film off net without creating damage) than it's worth."
1,Drivers missing from an excellent product,I loved this device. In upgrading my system to Vista and now win7 it became useless. I have tried some user made drivers but have had no luck. The Ergodex website has been unchanged for about 2 years. Big bummer for such an excellent concept.To be clear - This does not work with Vista or Win7. Some people have had some success writing their own drivers but normal support channels don't exist.
2,No Support,"Great product. I used it for a long time under Windows XP. When I recently upgraded to Windows 7, I found no current drivers. And most of the third party sites are full of dead links. The company's tech support did respond, but there does not seem to be much hope for any new software releases. They referred me to purchase another pad, for $150, that has Win7 support."
1,Great Pad If only the Company gave Support and Drivers!,"As others have commented, I will merely echo the statement. I paid 150 bucks for what has become a giant paperweight. It works great with WinXP. It really is a great product!! Works as advertised, the keys are durable, they do come off/on and continue to stick after many uses.The problem is the company hasn't come out with drivers for Vista OR Win7. If you check their website you'll see a notice saying they are working on Vista drivers - that notice is several years old at this point and never got anywhere.This item is totally useless at this point if you're running anything beyond WinXP. Very sad. There are supposedly user-created drivers out there and others have gotten them to work, I have not however so I continue to own an expensive paperweight.DO NOT BUY From this company!! There's another product exactly like this one that doesn't come from Ergodex - and its supported!"
3,Doesn't support Vista,"A product like this markets toward the computer enthusiast, a person who keeps ahead of the curve and upgrades to the latest and greatest, e.g. Vista.However this product doesn't currently (mar07) support Windows Vista. Someone over at Ergodex dropped the ball.To be fair though, when it was working on XP. it worked beautifully. (with the exception of programming with the 'windows' button) thats why i gave it a 3 instead of a 2.c'mon ergodex. where's our official vista drivers"
4,"No new drivers, but it still can work with ""aftermarket drivers""","Ergodex promised to make new drivers for this, but they never followed through!Instead, they created a new board that is like twice the cost of this one, but does the same thing. It is absurd!Luckily, someone out there created some drivers that work for Windows 7! They work excellent, it only takes a little bit of know-how. It is a simple as going to your Device Manager and pointing it to the folder of drivers that you downloaded! It is really quite simple and most people who would using this board are quite computer savvy as it seems.The new drivers are at: [...]"
1,Everyone who made this movie are sick.,"This must have been a video game, If it was ment to be a movie, it failed on all fronts. It's so bad, it is not a movie, Maybe more of a reject TV pilot for a new MTV reality show."
1,EGADS!,"This installment is even worse. I really thought it was some kind f joke when the rumors about this sequel were generating. After the commercial failure of the first, I'm surprised it got even made! This time I didn't do something stupid like buy the DVD like I did with the first. I watched this sequel for free via youtube. And I'm sorry to say that not even the beautiful Natasia Malthe could give this movie a pulse. And I have a question. Why were Rayne's eyes brown in this movie? Uwe Boll's utter lack of continuity doesn't surprise me at all. With so many box office failures behind him, tt astounds me how he is still getting money from studios to direct."
1,WHY???!!!,"What egotistical, extremely ignorant, no talent, brainwashed creature gave Uwe Boll the funds to create a second Blood Rayne movie?? The first movie netted what like negative 30 million dollars? What made them think this would do any better? Are they in the business of losing money and insulting people's wits with such garbage?"
3,ok,coulda been better. just adding more words to this list because they want me to keep talking and I dont.
2,Disappointing,This was disappointing compared to the original Bloodrayne. I would not recommend this one to anyone. It was slow and boring.
1,I found the worst movie ever.,"Ok I admit I have BloodRayne so I wanted the second one. I will watch a ""B"" movie; sometimes they aren't bad.I have to say this is a great way to get your kids to clean their room... force them to watch the first 5 minutes and they will beg you to let them go.The guy holding the camera was worse than the one in Blair Witch. The directer I think just came from the porn business (although there is NO nudity in this film) (that could have improved it). The actors... well a second grader is MUCH better (Michael Pare' what happened to you).The only somewhat good screen was the one fight screen between Rayne and Billy the Kid."
1,"Oh God, was the first one not bad enough?","At least BR-1 set a low enough bar that pretty much anything would be an equal. But really....a sequel? Are we really that bereft of ideas?Amazon truly needs to add a ""0 stars"" option, or maybe just a single brown star."
1,Stop Uwe Boll,"Please do not see this movie, it will just encourage the worlds greatest monster (Uwe Boll) to make more movies and destroy more of our beloved videogames. Everything that needs to be said about this atrocity has been handled by my fellow reviewers. I just felt the need to do my part to stop the spread of Uwe Boll's garbage. If you're curious about this movie because of the ""Hott Chicks"" as one of the other 'reviewers' said, well, thats what we have the internet for. Don't see it! (or any of Boll's other movies for that matter). Thank you for your time."
1,ugh,"This movie is just as bad as the first. Or maybe just a smidge better. Just a tiny little bit better. Yeah. The first one was completely abysmal, and so saying this movie is just a tiny bit better isn't saying much. The only thing that added ANY interest to this dreck is that it was set in the Old West. This movie is a drag to watch, and is almost laughable at how contrived it is. At least there was a different actor for Rayne, since the one in the first Bloodrayne was just awful. At least the actress for this film was better than the one who played Rayne in the first, but that's not saying much."
1,UGGHH,"This is a movie you really should not buy or watch. Do yourself a big favor and save your money and an hour and a half of your life which could be better spent by picking up dog poo in the park. Do the movie industry and uwe boll a favor by not buying it which maybe will finally force uwe boll to find something to do that he is actually good at, but keep him away from any movie making.. This was another tragedy concocted by boll. another movie that I believe could be good with many sequels if they had just let someone make it besides boll..he is the worst...do not buy or watch this...I repeat!! DO NOT BUY OR WATCH THIS MOVIE!! By the way, I gave it 1 star because it wouldnt let me give it anything lower"
3,A bit far fetched,"I watched this film for the first time and found it a bit far fetched in the story line... especially since it has pretty much NOTHING to do with the first BloodRayne movie! Quite frankly, vampires in the Old West with Billy The Kid at the head and then alluding to The Clanton Gang and their cohorts as being vampires also kind of loses its' allure in the vampire genre. If you're bored I guess it's ok to watch though..."
3,NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE ARE SAYING,"I WILL ADMIT THE MOVIE WAS LACKING HERE AND THERE, BUT IS NOT ALL THAT BAD OF A MOVIE. I ENJOYED IT MYSELF! I MEAN COWBOY VAMPIRES, WHY NOT."
2,campy vampy western,"This is a B-movie, nothing more, and on that level it was successful. Inane plot, cheesy characters, and complete logic-failures are just a few of the indictments easily leveled against this film. But I admit, it did make me bust up laughing in more than a scene or two. Poking fun at these kinds of movies is really part of their appeal. They are made to be corny. So set your expectations accordingly.By the way, the outdoor cinematography startled me; sweeping mountain vistas, cold winter snows, and dark approaching storm clouds were very well done, adding lots of mood to this otherwise campy film."
1,Why even bother at all,"I'll make plain and simple, the mistake with both BloodRayne films is that the producers and director of ""The House of the Dead"", which was a piece of sh** was allowed to put their hands on this video game to movie project."
5,This is the best chocolate flavored coffee I've ever had!,"I was a real skeptic! But this is the best chocolate flavored coffee anywhere. We bought it because my wife wanted it and wow, what a great cup of coffee for a quiet evening with a good book. I strongly recommend. (Great customer service too!)"
4,Very worthy buy,"This compilation is slammed down perfectly by Chicago's DJ Naw-T-Boy. For those of you who are New York House fanatics as myself, you will appreciate this compilation, it is up there with many of our hard house compilations. The music is put down hard,and the flavor is almost comparable to that of New York. Chicago definetly has a good taste for house music.For those of you who are familiar with the Chicago scene, you know your style is up there....by far."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this CD. I love many of the bands, but... why such a style change to fit the Christmas songs? The CD seems very slow and down beat. I was looking forward to the screamo bands rocking out, not withdrawing their scream. Over all this CD will put me to sleep by the fire side like every other Christmas CD. I was really looking forward to a CD that made Christmas songs come a live again... oh well. At least it beats what you hear in Wal-Mart all year long"
5,Return of old favorites!,"I had most of these performances on LP when they came out. I think I learned to love Mozart best through Klemperer's recordings.Time has not dimmed their brilliance and the sound is superb for their vintage.Yes - he is slower sometimes but his control over the orchestra and the details that this brings out is revalatory. Dividing the violins was also Klemperer's chosen arrangement and it pays such dividends with Mozart.I know these are not ""authentic"" but who cares. This is Mozart playing and conducting of the best calibre. I only hope that the rest of the symphonies he recorded will become available again soon.If you are new to Klemperer's Mozart - try these you will not be disappointed."
5,You will enjoy!,"I purchased this CD directly from Tim Davis years ago in Greenville, NC when he was promoting it. I didn't know him or had never heard him sing before, but I felt compelled to buy it. I have been enjoying it ever since. He's a talented individual with a humble spirit. The CD is great. The songs minister to the young and the old. My favorite is ""Don't Wanna Go Back"". That year I met him, that was the main CD I listened to on my way to Florida and back."
3,Good Potential,"I love a good fantasy, but Time Bandits, while an intriguing concept, somehow left me feeling as if it needed to be better ""stitched"" together, and needed a better tempo. Admittedly it came out in the infancy of fantasy movies, and that may be a factor. Claudia Newcorn - author of the award-winning fantasy, Crossover,Crossover: Krisálys Chronicles of Féyree"
5,"And ""Vending Success Secrets"" became flesh!","This book is awesome! I bought this book to help answer questions before establishing my route. Bill Way is a phenomenal businessman with a ""calling"" for vending. This book will walk you step by step towards wealth and success. The book ""Vending Secrets"" helped me to identify my vending niche and establish a sound business plan. This book provides my business with many valuable resources while on the path to success. Not to mention, I spoke with the Author Bill Way via telephone. He not only took the time to help steer me right, but also didn't try to sell me a thing! This book is clear, concise, and to the point. As the preacher references the ""Bible,"" so should a vending operator reference the ""Vending Secrets."" I can honest to God say, that this book saved my business from a lot of costly mistakes. Anyone, looking to get in the business, MUST BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Wate of time,"This book not only reads like an infomercial, but a bad one at that. At least put some useful information rather then one poorly written advertisement."
4,Good Beginner Book,"If you're considering the vending biz this is a great book to get started regarding basics etc. Not bad, a little biased maybe on machines etc. but definitely worth the read."
4,new hope,Excellent introduction to the ills facing Los Angeles. A good overview of potential solutions being offered by various community and social organizations.
1,Sucks but cures insomnia,"This book is poorly written and an absolute chore to read. On any given page, a tiny bit of useful information is buried under a pile of extravagant vocabulary, which is generally confusing and completely pointless but I'm sure serves some author's inflated ego quite well.Detestable that somebody finds this appropriate as a textbook."
1,Bad DVD of a Good Movie,Not genuine letterboxed. Portion of original picture missing. Read review under the orginal DVD two-pack release of Strange Bedfellows/Man's Favoite Sport.
2,Gina not Sophia,"With apologies to Gina Lollobrigida, this is a paean to the Italian romantic comedies of the day (1960's) which featured the great Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroiani. Gina was similar looking and even sounding. Still, there is no substitute and this film falls apart as a poor man's Doris Day/Rock Hudson film. The plot is strange and doesn't quite make sense either.There is a scene where Rock Hudson is visited in bed by another grown man, which is supposed to be shockingly funny. At the time, it might have been. Of course now, we know that Rock was 'differently oriented'...i.e. on the 'other team'. So the key scene of the film is not funny at all..."
4,Love Rockabrigida-style,"Although I like the Rock Hudson-Doris Day romantic comedies, Rock and Gina are much more sophisticated and the scripts of both Come September and Strange Bedfellows are much wittier. And when the Strange Bedfellows characters played by Rock and Gina first reunite after seven years, the celluloid sizzles. Rock and Gina are both gorgeous. Rock does double-takes that would do Cary Grant proud, and Gina displays the fabled Italian temper to a fare-thee-well. Both films are worth re-watching just to laugh and sigh. There'll never be another Rock Hudson, more's the pity.I would recommend both Strange Bedfellows and Come September unhesitatingly."
3,Was Hoping for Better,"Although this is not a bad movie, it is not quite as good as I expected. I loved ""Come September"" which also had Rock Hudson and Gina Lolabrigida in it, so I thought I would see if they had made any other movies together. ""Strange Bedfellows"" turned out to be the only other film they made together and I ordered it in hopes of finding the same chemistry and humor in it as I had seen in ""Come September"". I can say this movie was only OK. If you're looking for a good comedy with these stars, I highly recommend ""Come September"" and wouldn't bother with ""Strange Bedfellows"" unless you are just a major fan of the stars and want it for that purpose alone."
3,Rock and Gina: our ideal bedfellows,"Matters of sexuality apart, Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida would make highly desirable bedfellows, beautiful as they were in the mid 1960's. Melvin Frank's comedy is only average, but it has some very funny moments. Gig Young and Terry-Thomas provide good support. Lollo, dressed by Jean Louis, is a sight to behold; not to mention that her gift for comedy manages to surface here and there."
2,I really wanted to like this but...,"I love Rock Hudson movies so I took a chance and ordered this one based on the reviews. I was really disappointed. There was nothing spectacular about the film. The cinematography was dull as well as the dialogue. In my opinion it did not live up to his work with Doris Day in Pillow Talk, Lover come back, or, Send Me No Flowers. In a word, boring."
3,classic comedy,I love these two together in a comedy. The up and down relationship is very intertaining. I hadn't seen this one for over 30 years and it wasn't quite as funny as what I had remembered as a teen. I still definitely liked it and would recomend it to others.
2,"Ordered two signs, one was damaged","I ordered two skateboard signs for my grandsons-one came thru the mail undamaged, the other was so crumpled up that I can not give it as a gift. The company said they would send me a replacement, which I have not received. I'm still hoping to get the replacement by Christmas. The packaging did not protect the product from the United States Postal Service."
4,Good album...,"Los 3 Sabores is a good album by Johnny Ray and his band Salsa con Clase. This album features three flavors of salsa (Columbian, New York, and Puerto Rican). The tracks are arranged well, the tracks that are remade such as Lejos de Ti (made famous by Angel Canales) and Cali Pachanguero's (made famous by Grupo Niche) arrangements sound nothing like the predecessors which make the songs sound new and fresh. Vocalist Nodal Hernandez, Carlos Torres, and Willie Cortes handle the material well. Standout tracks include Que No Quede Huella, Lejos De Ti, and Cali Pachanguero. Different sounding album then the rest of the stuff released in 1992."
1,Not a good tattoo video!!!,He doesnt explain anything as he is tattooing. I don't see where anyone could learn anything. So glad I rented it and didnt actually pay 20 for the dvd. I'm sure all of his titles are just as bad.
3,"GOOD, not great cd",this is a good freshman effort from Wookie J. Shinehead and Natty Remo work well with him also Rocka t. with a lil more time and confidence he can be a player in the game. production is soild
3,Bias in Book Reviewing,"Unfortunately Amazon.com's system of reader reviews permits uninformed bias to enter and remain in the system without (in most cases) any attempt at editing or correction. The two reviews from King's Point appear to be from the same person, who REALLY doesn't like this book. Fair enough for one such opinion, but two is at least one too much. The review from the Netherlands appears to reflect a different sort of uninformed bias -- its author likes quite another approach (de Mause's version of psychohistory), and thus happily trashes a book on the basis of second-hand opinions. I don't feel Szaluta's book is the best in the field (as one of the blurbs has it) -- far from it. But it's a decent attempt at an introduction to psychohistory as most scholars in the field understand the term ""psychohistory."" If you want really sophisticated examples of psychohistory, try nearly any book by Erik Erikson or by William M. Runyan."
1,This book is [weak]!,"As I have understood recently out of quite reliable sources, this book is hopelessly outdated. It consists out of a completely unedited translation of the French version that appeared about ten years ago. People that are *seriously* interested in Psychohistory better buy Lloyd DeMause's most recent book ""The Emotional Life of Nations"" ...(DeMause's ""History of Childhood"" is a MUST HAVE for anyone concerned with Wilhelm Reich's ""Children of the Future""..."
4,Great George Strait video.,"This is from 1986 New Years Eve in Dallas Texas. George Strait does his songs with alot of class and style and very good video. Some interesting things on this video like the countdown to 1987 it shows just how old this video is. A wild 80's country crowd jumping with excitement with mullet haircuts and bad 80's perm hairstyles. And of course George belting great stuff like Amarillo by morning, Dance time in Texas, and The Fireman and many others. This is the later version of this video they kind of fixed some things like adding some bonus footage about his albums at the beginning and a Check yes or no video at the end. Really good video though great concert from the 80's."
5,George Strait New Years Eve Concert,"This George Strait concert was recorded new years eve 1986 and the music is excellent, his band The Ace In The Hole was phenomenal that night as they are for every performance. George Strait was in great voice and he smiled and intertained as best as any singer could or ever would. As it was pointed out by another, he had lost his daughter that year. And if you've seen that man perform before you'll notice there is not the usual spark in his eyes. I'm sure his heart was breaking the entire time, longing to face the new year with his daughter still in his arms. But even so, his performance was classic Strait, energy in the swing tunes and breaking those women hearts as he sang the romantic ballads. There has been and always will be just one George Strait."
2,dvd purchase,"I ordered this product for my sister-in-law because this one was supposing to be the latest release as advertised on tv. The product was not the new one released on June 15,2010 but a remake of one she already has. Therefore I was very dissatisfied with my purchase because was not the product I hoped it would be."
4,Wonderful series--BUT . . .,"Just so others to whom this might be meaningful know: This gripping, well-acted series with intense story lines has no captioning. I watch everything with captions so I can catch occasional mumbled dialogue. I really struggle with this series on DVD, as the actors have fairly heavy accents and frequently do not articulate very clearly. I estimate that I'm missing (easily) 25 percent of what's spoken. I've no regrets about buying the set (I also bought seasons 5 and 6 and the episode that was released separately), but my viewing pleasure would be greatly enhanced if the DVDs had closed captioning. Given that the series is not that old, I was completely surprised that I couldn't access captions. Other than that (to me, significant) complaint about the set, the series is wonderful! If closed captioning was available, I would definitely give this set 5 stars."
4,DIFFERENT IT IS.,BOUGHT THIS OUT OF CURIOSITY AND FOUND THE STORYLINE DIFFERENT BUT VERY INTERESTING.DON'T THINK IT WILL BE FOR EVERYONE AS SOME OF THE STORIES ARE A BIT MORBID OR DISTURBING.THE MAIN CHARACTER GROWS ON YOU.
2,what's the big deal?,"I'm sure these ""Catts"" put a lot of effort into this album, but their efforts aren't impressive.Silly lyrics. Juvenille songwriting. Overall, just kind of bad.Good luck with the next album, fellas."
4,These are the real thing,"Best razor blades ever made. I switched back from electric razor and haven't gone back. If you have access to liquid nitrogen or a 77 K freezer, store the blades intact in their package in the cold for a day. That's supposed to lengthen their usable time and from experience I think it's true."
5,Excellent quality and price,Arrived when promised and the product is of excellent quality and the price cannot be beaten. I'm very happy with it.
3,mediocre milk thistle,"The 21st century milk thistle is the best i've tried. This is cheaper, but i end up taking more, and still doesn't do the job that the 21st century does."
3,teachers' manual only,"This book is very helpful for experience teachers only. Budding teachers should consider to get ""100 lessons in classical dance"" instead."
1,Product failed,Overall the product was well packaged and even came with the drill bit needed to mount the sensors. But the control box is of poor quality and failed after 1 day of proper operation.
4,Very handy tool,"I like this product very much. It offers different ways to screen for results, such as rhyming or jumble making it useful this way for crossword solving. The definitions and synonyms found are hyperlinked. Most words are also pronounced which makes this program especially beneficial to those who speak English as a second language. While it doesn't offer itself as more than a dictionary/thesaurus, would like to have a more complete reference tool - atlas, encyclopedia, etc."
3,tabs misaligned,"It's odd, but the alphabet tabs are not aligned with the right page in the dictionary."
2,Not as hip as Woody may have intended.,"I love the OJC reissues of Woody's Fantasy albums from the 70s, but I was truly disappointed with the CD. The recording quality is sketchy and the band sounds uncomfortable playing the rock-oriented material. ""Montevideo"" is probably the most interesting chart, but that's not saying much when you listen to the other cuts. What saves the album are the contributions of the individual soloists, most notably Greg Herbert and Andy LaVerne.From the pompous octave trumpeting on the first track to the awkward funk of ""Crosswind,"" this album is definitely for Herman completists. Virtually the same band is better featured on the impressive ""Thundering Herd"" album (which was recorded a few months earlier); it showcases what talent this edition of the Herd truly possessed. Seek out that release instead."
1,Bless them for their intentions,What more can I say I bought it in the hopes that the return of Livgren might mean the return of Kansas but Livgren has already composed his masterpieces and Walsh has already blown his voice out performing them over the years. Take nothing away from my #1 band they are the best in my book. But this should prove to them they should pawn their instruments and hang it up before they turn into the Rolling Stones or something. Nah Kansas can't be that bad can they? Buy this album and you'll agree.
2,Not there best!,"Been a fan for 22 years and I`m writing this review because I`m ticked that I bought it. I have the complete Kansas catalog and after hearing Kerry Livgren talk about the song`s I was really looking forward to this CD but you get a glimpse of who they used to be in the first five song`s about every minute it sounds like Kansas for a couple of seconds then it changes again, this definitly is not there best it sounds like someone else trying to sound like Kansas the last five song`s are better then the first five. It`s just a very frustrating Cd because your reminded of how good they can be but they just don`t achieve it.Part`s of the cd remind me of ""In the spirit of thing`s' especially Not man big. The other problem is the music is very stripped down not a whole lot of textures going on like old Kansas, such as Point of Know Return,or Leftoverture, I could go on and on about why I dislike this CD but I don`t want to bore you as much as this CD bored me!"
2,Awful,This is just terrible. Steve Walsh shouldn't sing a note again. It's a shame that in 17 years Kerry Livgren couldn't come up with songs worthy of the Kansas name. Let the Kansas name rest with honor.
4,More Than I Expected,"I finally got Somwhere to Elsewhere this week and was surprised from the first time I played it. There are just so many classic Kansas moments on this album. Kerry Livgren did a wonderful job with the writing of this album. He really writes songs that have great melodies, yet pushes the boundaries of what rock music should be. He really hasn't lost a beat. While some of the vocals sound a little strained, I actually prefer them that way. Age will bring changes to a singers voice and I accept that. Steve Walsh has accepted it and makes the most with what he has. I think he sounds great. After listening to this album, all I was thinking was I wished there was another album that came after it.Even though this was their last real recording, they surely ended on a high note. Anyway, Kerry moved on to Proto-Kaw and has done some wonderful things there.Please, give this one a chance."
4,Year 2000 model of Kansas is here...,"I'll let others wax endlessly nostalgic about this recording. Really, this is THE follow up to all the Kansas albums from Song for America to Point of Know Return, with a decidedly modern - Y2K - feel to each track. I always admired this bands musicianship and song writing abilities, and they are in great form here.Get this CD, and it will be in heavy rotation in your player."
5,KANSAS does it again - and does it perfectly,"From the opening piano sequence on Icarus II, one is mesmerized by this CD. It truly has something for everyone. There are hauntingly beautiful ballads, unbelievably intricate movements of progressive rock, the unique Kansas style blues, and plenty of their signature guitar sounds, some of which will make the most devote metal fan take notice. Steve Walsh's vocals are great - in fact, this is the best I have ever heard him. It was great to hear all the original members together again, and Billy Greer is amazing on ""Look at the Time"".In short, if you have any appreciation for music, this CD is an absolute must have. The radio world needs to give particular attention to ""Myriad"" and ""Not Man Big"". It will seem almost criminal if this CD does not get significant airtime."
3,OK CD,"IT'S A GOOD RECORDING WITH THE ORIGINAL LINE-UP. ANYONE WHO SAYS IT'S AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST FEW ALBUMS NEEDS TO PUT ""SONG FOR AMERICA"" IN AND LISTEN TO IT A FEW HUNDRED TIMES. MAYBE THIS ONE WILL GROW ON ME, BUT I DOUBT IT."
3,A Renaissance that could have been better,"It seems that the ProgRock revival that swaps around the world these days allows classic prog bands to return onto the scene. One of them is Kansas. After a great creative period in the 70s and a not-so-great botch phase in the 80s, they finally return in the original lineup. Kerry Livgren has taken over the songwriting duties, but it seems that he has crossed his zenith with ""Leftoverture"". Although there are some great moments on ""Somewhere to Elsewhere"" where the music sounds as fresh and complex as in the 70s, most of the tracks sound just too ordinary. I wonder why Kerry Livgren missed his chance to create a Neo-ProgRock milestone. Maybe he will be doing better next time - if any."
2,What a let-down!,"Inspired by promises that Kansas had returned to what their music was originally all about, we were eager to hear their new CD. We were so disappointed! Over-produced, too-compressed - all the songs sound the same. Obviously, we are in the minority in this list, but here's our review - if you are a progressive rock fan, and had hoped that Kansas would return to its roots, you may be very disappointed."
3,They're baaaack,"They're baaaack. With the original lineup together for the first time in a very long time, Kansas throws a bit of nostalgia our way. Here is the best of Kansas; long, elaborate instrumentals, key and tempo changes, mystical lyrics, violins juxtaposed with crunching guitars. And here is the worst of Kansas; long, meadering instrumentals, awkward key and tempo changes, pretentious lyrics, violins juxtaposed with crunching guitars. This has always been the problem with Kansas. In their quest to create inventive progressive rock, they fail as often as they succeed. Half of this album is great, soaring and powerful, while the other half... isn't. I will give them credit, though, for having the gumption to produce an album that is so gloriously out of style. Certainly worth having if you are a fan."
2,not really a comeback album imho,"YEAH the classic lineup of the famous band KANSAS including Hope, Steinhardt and Livgren are on this album but the album is so lackluster, insipid and flaccid. I kinda wondered what was the purpose of them getting together. The album did not make a dent to my mind. There was a song or two that tried to remenisce about their glorious days in the 70's but noticed I said ""TRIED"". It just sounds like they lost their testosterone.If they come together again, I expect a much stronger statement as to what a ""REUNION"" means."
2,"Poor vocals, lacklustre performance and average songwriting","Poor vocals, lacklustre performance and average songwriting does not make for a great cd even if it does contain the classic lineup"
4,delicious graphic pornography with an S/M flavor,"Eric von Gotha brings his luscious blonde heroine into the depths of a ""very special prison,"" in which she joins a bevy of equally beautiful inmates in suffering all manner of sexual humiliation. The pen and ink work is lovely, and there is even a plot of sorts! Von Gotha's artistry can portray the anguish and tears of a subjugant far more effectively than any photo or video of a live, disinterested model I have seen."
3,Great artwork... but only so-so erotica...,"I thought the drawings were wonderful, but the story line here is a bit too brutal. This poor girl is constantly beaten and sexually assaulted by her jailers who delight in being cruel to her for some unexplained reason. While this can be erotic at times, eventually it just becomes monotonous. Probably the sexiest part (in my opinion) was when one of the female guards takes an interest in our pretty prisoner, but then a male guard is quick to interfere before the scene gets even remotely interesting. Still, the artwork was quite pretty. I just wish the author showed more imagination."
2,didn't fit...,"I consulted Amazon's ""see if it fits"" drop menu to see if it fit my car.It stated that it did fit, so I ordered...it didn't fit. I'm sure it's a decent filter but I am less than pleased so, 2 stars.So if you are wondering, it DOES NOT fit a 2001 Honda Civic EX as stated by Amazon."
1,DON'T STEAL THIS CD!,"How typical in this day and age of soundtracks...a record company ignores the truly great artists of the era depicted in the movie and corrals younger (read: TOP-TEN HOPEFUL)artists to re-record the tracks. How can a story about1960's radical Abbie Hoffman be decorated with the likes of Mary Chapin Carpenter and Sheryl (""I'll sing anything if you pay me"")Crow? Did the original artists want to actually be paid for their songs this time around? (How dare they! )Surely it would've been worth it to enhance the movie with the voices of that time? This album reeks of corporate maneuvering. (""Dylan is too expensive, but Country Joe isn't, so let's use him to give the album credibility""). Shame on you! Abbie Hoffman is turning in his grave. For the sequel why not get N'Sync to sing ""We Won't Get Fooled Again"" and Mandy Moore could do a mean ""Ball and Chain""."
3,Using the images the book uses,"I think this book has excellent details and instructions for learning Photoshop, but the one thing it doesn't have is a disc or website listed to download the images used in the examples. It is harder to learn the steps when you don't have the images the book uses, so I only give it three stars."
5,Rare Birds,"Great book. Not only well written but written with the insight of a mature, intelligent sensitive human being. Great insight into the human condition. The author comes from a unusally talented and creative family and as this book demonstrates is as creative as any of them. Telling us the story of his family gives us alot information about the political climate in the USA and its effect on individual citizens. Extremly interesting and varied Family members from the world's must prolific bird watcher to a Leftist screen writer who fought with the Abraham Lincoln`Brigade in the Spanish Civil War."
4,What a family!,"After reading ""Rare Birds"" by Dan Bessie I thought, ""What a family!"". Every family has a few characters or maybe a semi-famous person. But, in ""Rare Birds"" I was totally fascinated by the wide range of interesting and famous family members. I especially liked the chapters on his Uncle Harry Burnett and the Turnabout Theatre. The book is written in a relaxed style that makes you feel like you're having a conversation with the author. It made me want to search out my own family tree, shake it and see who falls out. Fascinating and enjoyable book!"
1,Not a replacement ignition switch,This item description is not accurate and is misleading. I thought I was buying a replace ignition switch assembly for a Geo Tracker.This item is an inertial cutoff switch to interrupt fuel flow in a crash (this item is in addition to a normal functional factory ignition switch system). NOWHERE IN THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS THIS INFORMATION GIVEN. I am now stuck with this useless item due to the 30 day refund policy.
4,Great movies for a really good price!,After watching this disc now i know why this movie is one of the best rated scary movie series from the 80's. The video quality was a little off compared to other bluray's on the market but considering these movies are almost 30 years old there's not much you can do about actually making it look any better. The sound as well was not real spectacular. Overall this movie collection in my rating is a 4 star rating!
3,WOW,"I Love Nightmare on elm st and have been waiting and waiting for dream warriors to hit bluray. the fans i smelled trouble when warner decided to release 2&3 together. i wasnt gonna order until the description said it had two discs. well let me tell you they are not on two discs. they are on one. Very Disappointing! im sure its still fine, but still thats lame. I dont think i own one other bluray with two full length released theatrically films that share the same bluray. Wouldnt it be hilarious if they treated freddy's revenge like the terror in aisle bonus on Halloween 2 and made it only accessible through the bonus features menu? hahah"
4,Mostly Good but 1 annoying flaw,"The movies look good and the special features are nice. I'm a big Freddy fan and I hadn't seen most of the special features before. The only thing I would have liked is a new commentary track for each movies duration. But the one big flaw that I notice right away is on the first menu screen when you choose if you want to watch part 2 or part 3. The half of the screen for part 3 has two pictures. One is the standard picture that I have seen before of 3 headshots. Heather Langenkamp on the left, Patricia Arquette in the middle, and Laurence Fishburn on the right. Then, for some reason, there is a picture of Freddy taken from a scene in Freddy vs Jason. WHY IS THAT THERE??? There are plenty of great pics of Freddy from part 3. Why not use one of those? It's not really that big of a deal, but it bothers me because I HATED Freddy vs Jason and I think it's the worst entry in both series."
1,What is this?!!!,"2 Nightmare on Elm Street movies in one cheap plastic box?!!!!New Line stop jerking with the fans, these movies deserve a luxury box sets with individual box sets for each movie..."
2,"It's not New Line, It's Warner","It's Warner fault for this packaging. Since the awfull remake new line cinema doesn't have control. Warner has no respect for the franshise. Lame Remake, lame bluray editions and it will go on with a sequel to the lame remake."
3,A little of a let down,I was so excited to read this book as a belle myself.There was a lot of bad language. At times it made me wantto discontinue reading it. It was alright. Probably not a bookI would read agagin.
3,Definitely not a great Southern Entertaining book...,"I did not totally like this book. I am orginally from the North and have been in the South since 2000. The women I have met here are great. They are warm, traditional, Christian-minded and hard working! This book made them look like flakes and somewhat unintelligent. I bought this book since my husband is Southern and I wanted to really be able to provide him with great southern cooking and entertaining. Some of the information was useful...but anyone could have gotten the information from any other Southern entertainment book. Some parts of the book were amusing and even some of the recipes were interesing. But overall this book wasn't a great book."
1,Makes Elevator Music Seem Like Beethoven,"What garbage! According to the liner notes the music was written while in a state of meditation. Well the ""composer"" might as well have been asleep. If I could take 10 minutes to write a simple computer program to generate this kind of fluff and market it properly, I could be a millionaire! All that is done is hold a note or two down on the synth and occasional play a different note. No form, melody, orchestration, etc. It makes those Andes flute improvisation relaxation CDs seem like James Galway on acid."
3,Not Overly Impressed,"When I ordered these balls I ordered three and followed the exact instructions to submit the photo and text. After submitting the photo and text I recieved an email asking if I wanted the school logo on the ball. I said no and repeated what I wanted put on the ball. When I recieved the ball the balls had the logo I specifically said not to put on, and also did not include half of the text I wanted. The seams on the ball were also pink as if they were severly faded by the sunlight. The photo printed on the one of the balls I ordered (I ordered 3) is already coming off in one corner and I recieved them today."
4,Great movie for Kilmer fans..,An early film by Val Kilmer. Some may think it drags on but it ends up being a pretty good movie. Val Kilmer fans must see his great performance. I'd recommend to at least rent if not by this movie.
5,Wonderful!!,Val Kilmer gives yet another great performance in this movie; he truly becomes Robert Burns. 1000 Chains was captivating...you get caught up in the main character's struggle for freedom. This picture was very eye-opening. I would recommend that everyone see this movie!
1,Nasty!,This stuff is so nasty that I couldnt even finish the first glass! It must be mixed in a blender or it will not disolve. Save your money.
1,Save your money!!!!,"I bought two of these and saw no results what so ever, I actually lost weight. The mix has a hard time totally dissolving so you will routinely drink big clumps of powder. Also the mix does not last long because they have you using one big scoop per serving. The scoop is one cup I believe. I recently bought GMC brand of whey protein and there is no comparison. GMC's stuff actually tastes good and I don't mind drinking it. Anyways you get what you pay for."
1,It was already used,THE shipment was great but when i open it there was a clear sealed...when i open the sealed and take the cover off the other sealed was broken like someone used it then shipped it the icon is stripping off....VERY BAD BARGAIN!!!!!!
5,Burgoyne Surrounded,Truly a classic quilt pattern revisited. I like the ease of the instructions and how the book offers different block and quilt sizes for the same pattern to make it adaptable for personalizing your home.
2,too small to read,"The type was so small it was almost unreadable. It's as if the book was a small, cheap version of a large art book."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this as a gift for my brother, and was not aware that this isn't a typical edition, but an apparently cheaply published one. The book is a big, floppy paperback--not what I expect when ordering a novel, and not what I would consider gift material. Besides this, no complaints."
4,"Get up and dance, Charlie Cruz is in 'da house!","Charlie Cruz has put together a great group of songs that will keep you dancing all night long. I love 1) Grita Conmiga, be proud of who you are and there is nothing better than being latin! I know there are only 9 songs but they are a very good. 2) Ven Denorame Otra Vez, 4) Mala and 7)Curame are outstanding."
4,I am delighted with it,after hrs of comparing different units I decided on the c350. I have had it about a week now. I am very pleased with it. It was quite slow to initially locate itself and is very slow in doing a new address search to the point that I suspected it freezed up. it is very visible in all but direct sunlight. the unit is quick to correct its route and tell you to get back if you deviate from a planned route. It would appear to be impossible to get lost based on my use so far. the Map data seems accurate to within a 2-3 years. Its now a year latter april 2008 and it served me well but I upgraded to a tomtom 720 beccause i refused to pay $100 for a needed map upgrade. Interestingly while the TOMTOM is not as bright it is much easier to see in full sunlight
4,"Enlightening, Refreshing","Caputo has written with style and humor an excellent introduction to a contemporary view of religion. And because he is well aware of the pitfalls of modern religion, he has been able to present a revitalized view of it for the 21st century, based on the theme of love. Caputo's book is a great read."
2,Post-Secularism? No thanks!,"Caputo has written much on Derrida's approach to religion and if your familiar with this attitude also associated with Levinas, usually dubbed as post-secularism, then you know what to expect. I enjoyed some of the insights within this book, but Zizek's On Belief from the same series surpasses this work on many accounts. Pass this one up in favor his. It's much more relevant and intellectually challenging."
4,"Beware, this is Series 1","This is just to make sure you don't make the same stupid mistake I did and misread the title: this is a 2 disc set of the first (and to date only) series, NOT the second series. The title can be a bit misleading..."
5,"Awesome show, but probably not for everyone","I very much enjoyed watching the 8 episode show. There is only one season, not because it wasn't popular enough to have more, but because that is how Chis Lilley (the creator, writer, and primary actor) wanted it. It is filmed in the documentary format, though is definitely tounge-in-cheek (what some people call a ""mockumentary""), similar to the show, ""The Office."" This particular show, however, is making fun of the different aspects of a typical Australian high school, as stated in the prologue of each episode. This is not a show of slapstick humor or funny one-liners. The humor mostly consists of poking fun at society. Some people will love the show, others will probably hate it."
4,Funny stuff,"I really did enjoy this series. First caught a glimpse of it on HBO, but then had to buy it for my own collection. If you are ever having a bad day you can put these on and it is an instant pleaser."
5,Hilarious,If you're a fan of Strangers With Candy you will like Summer Heights High. I just wish there were more episodes.
5,Great Mini-Series,"""Summer Heights High"" is a solid eight episodes of brilliance. Chris Lilley masterfully pulls off his trifecta of characters and roles creating three memorable personalities. I am not from Australia and find humor through each joke."
1,DVDs have copy protection,"This is a great series. Unfortunately, these DVDs were deliberately encoded with bad sectors to prevent copying, which causes these DVDs to not work in a wide range of DVD players. Save yourself a headache and get this series in another way that doesn't have copy protection. Probably the region 2 (from amazon.co.uk) version of these DVDs is not encumbered by copy protection."
4,A really nice Kenny Burrell album,"I'm a jazz guitarist and avid collector of jazz guitar albums. Most of Kenny's albums are very nice. A lot are on the bluesy side of the jazz fence. He's always a very tasteful player, gets a great tone, and always seems to maintain a deep connection to the blues. I remember one guitarist describing Kenny as spinning jazz lines that phrase like speech patterns. I believe that's true, and adds to the great warmth and humanity that his playing projects. I like this album, in particular because it has a very sultry, ""after hours"" kinda vibe going for it that really seems to complement Kenny. If you are interested in buying one Kenny Burrell album, this is my favorite."
3,new shoes,"Not a bad shoe for the price.I thought the shoe part was on size,the booties that fit inside were very tight and just as uncomfortable. And because of the booties I would not recommend these. Thanks"
1,knockoffsss,these shoes were really heavy and the sock was very narrow. we were very dissappointed with these shoes so we returned them.
2,"Good price, just booty was too narrow","Bought these for my son because he loved the way they looked online. Once we got them (fast shipping!) he couldn't get his foot inside the bootie, it was just extremely too narrow for his foot. We will be returning them."
5,Swayzak opens a club in your head,"Swayzak's second album has managed to wow me just as their first did. I love the way they subdue the beats and the melodies are thick and sticky... this music is extremely intimate; it feels like it's coming from inside you head. Personal highlight would have to be ""Doobie;"" they way it builds reminds me of someone desperately trying to squeeze one last use out of an empty tube of toothpaste!"
4,Sit back... Relax... and let the Trance begin....,"Smooth and melodic are the only two adjectives truly necessary to describe this album. Having never purchased anything of Swayzaks prior to ""Himawari,"" I wasn't altogether certain what to expect from it. I had read several immaculate reviews and thought I would go out on a limb and actually purchase an album without hearing even one single track on it. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.""Himawari"" has a couple tracks that are less than enthralling, but if you buy this album for nothing less than exposing your ears to Kirsty Hawkshaw's angelic voice in ""State of Grace"" or simply to groove to each introduction of a new synth sound in ""Mysterions,"" you'll have gotten your money's worth.Bottomline, this is an album that I would wager most electronica fans - particulary those that enjoy melodic trance - could sit back... relax... and enjoy."
1,Utter rubbish!,"I expected this book to be the ultimate reference to Domino R5, and boy was I disappointed.The first half of the book is basic end-user info (how to open a database, how to send a mail) and the second half is basic development with a short section at the end about programming using script etc. There is NOTHING about system administration (such things are missing as registering users; certifier ID's; mail routing - the real basics) and not enough on development to really recommend it.If you want a system admin book, buy the Rob Kirkland one (it's excellent). If you want an authoritive development book, join the queue because this one is a waste of money. The only reason why I haven't returned it is because the postage from the UK would be almost as much as the book cost me. Avoid this book - I'd give it no stars if I could."
2,Missing the basics,"1) I bought the Lotus Notes and Domino 5 Bible. I expected this reference book covering everything about R5 as its advertizing ""Inside, you'll find complete coverage of Lotus Notes and Domino 5"". The backbone of Lotus Notes and Domino is the Domino Directory (formerly the Names and Addresses Book), besides other important directories. Ironically, there is no entry for ""Directory"" in this book, not even Directory Assistant, Catalog Directory, LDAP directory, etc. How can this great book miss the backbone of what it should cover?...."
1,"If you want to learn, don't buy this book.","It appears that either no one edited this book or they had a fourth grade class do it. The text description of figures rarely matches the pictures being shown, and as others have noted it is missing the bare basics of programming for Domino and Notes. I have several bookcases of technical reference books and this is one of the worst."
5,A must for celtic fans,"This collection is a must for celtic fans. Unfortunately 5 DVDs can not cover the entire history of a team that has won 16 NBA titles. The games presented in their entirety are mostly from the 80s (Bird, Parish, McHale era) with the addition of the triple overtime classic of 1976 against the Suns. One could argue that one game against the Milwalky Bucks during the 79s could have made it to the collection. It is also a pity that no whole game from the Russell era made it to the set in it' s entirety, but probably the 60's footage wasn' t that good to be included in the DVD, and the documentaries included make up for that omission.On the technical side, there are very few technical hitches and the games are presented in their original broadcast (not as shown in the NBA's greatest games show, as for example in the Lakers box set)"
5,At long last... The Boston Celtics Dynasty on DVD!!!,"NBA Dynasty Series: Complete History of the Boston Celtics5 Greatest Games in Celtics History, in their entiretyCeltics unprecedented 16 championships will be covered in this DVDOver 21 hours of contentOver the past 50 years the Celtics have won an unprecedented 16 World Championships including 8 in a row from 1959-1966, making them the the most storied franchise in NBA history. This 5-disc special edition collector's set features the complete Boston Celtics history including year-end compilation programs highlighting the Championship seasons. Plus for the first time ever on DVD, the team's most memorable games in franchise history."
4,Must have for any Celtic fan!!,"The 5 disc set is well done with (6) great Celtic games in their entirity. Good to see two Celtic-Laker games from the '84 Finals, which was the greatest Finals series ever. Disc 1 has a good overview of the teams and championships from the 50 & 60's and 70's along with a segment on the Celtic-Laker rivalry in the '80's. Disc 2 has season ending compilations programs for the '81, '84 and '86 championship years.Included:'69 Finals Game 7 Celtics-Lakers (4th Qtr only)'76 Finals Game 5 Celtics-Suns (greatest game ever played)'81 East Conf Final-Game 7 Celtics-Sixers (Celts come back to win after being down 3-1)'84 Finals Game 4 Celtics-Lakers'84 Finals Game 7 Celtics-Lakers'86 Finals Game 4 Celtics-Rockets'87 East Conf. Finals Game 5 Celtics-Pistons (Bird steals the ball from an Isiah Thomas inbounds)"
1,Defetive DVD's,"I was psyched to watch a classic game, it even included pre game stuff,but 30 minutes in the dvd started to crap out. It happened again with the second dvd I tried. I am too frustrated to try to watch the other DVD's. It's sad that there is no quality control on a the dvd's"
2,Horrible,"This book really is unhelpful. Images common to many dreams aren't included, and the few images that are discussed in this book are improperly interpreted. The descriptions make no sense, and often are completely off base with general consensus on dream interpretations. If you're looking for a good book for dream interpretation, I instead recommend the 10,000 dreams interpreted book by Gustavus Hindman Miller - Miller's book has been around for many, many years, and is the book that most other dream interpretation books are based upon."
1,what nonsense,"this book was the lousiest thing ever. it all leads to the same thing. if you wanna know what it is, read the book yourself, but don't expect a great book. and also this stuff has nothing to do with the actual item. for example: ""waterfall"" allegedly means- at the 'basic' level of interpritation: CENSORED! don't read this book if you're looking for the truth about your dreams. instead, waste the money on hiring a professional to do it. that's how horrible this book is."
3,not what i expected,"This book is really great. I learned things that I didnt know. And now I can interpret my dreams really easily. But i only have one negative comment about the book, and that is when i read the first part of the book (before the interpretations section) it wasnt that ""free flow"" reading as I thought I would be. But apart from that, it is a very useful book."
4,Nice cd.,"All the compilation are perfect.The box was dagame, butgood for the personal collection.Than you for the service, fast and excellent.."
4,Smokin' J,"Compiled from 3 really cool cds (with some ""bonus"" tracks), this baby is a ""period"" best of. And if you love your J as much as I do... then dont miss out on this essential collection. It's blues, it's rock... it's in heavy rotation on my cd player. Kickin' out from the crypt, Screamin' J Hawkins is alive and well on this album!"
1,I was disappointed. These are re-hashes by the original artists.,I was disappointed. These are re-hases by the original artists - or minimally remixes off of the master that vary way too far from the original hit. (Some cover bands do a better job than some of these artists.)Dan
4,Relaxing Healing,"If relaxing is naturally healing to our bodies, minds, and spirits, this CD does exactly that."
5,Beautiful Music for the soul,"Calming and serene, this CD will take you away from the maddening world into a peaceful place to relieve stress."
5,soothing,I found that this particular CD is very spiritual. I listen to it when I am in bed reading a book or magazine.
5,Complete Relaxation!,I have heard this CD and was very impressed! The music is very relaxing. A perfect CD for any day...it'll get you in the holiday spirit whether your feeling happy or if your a tad blue. I'd recomend this album to anyone and everyone!
2,Nice playing but poor sound.,"Nice playing, but beware. The sound quality is nearly unacceptable. It sounds like the musicians are playing in a different room. The producer or someone involved in the mixing or mastering process must have slipped on the mixer board or something. The loss of midrange and treble energy makes the record kind of uninvolving. And I'm not talking about the sound through a super high-end system (my stereo setup is rather ""modest"", worth about $1500). Out of five stars I give the music four weak stars and the sound one strong star."
3,Guncon 2 with Vampire Nights,"I got the Guncon 2 with my Vampire Nights Bundle. If you are used to shooting a real pistol, you will notice you have to hold your wrist at an uncomfortable angle to line up the sights. This makes long gaming sessions tedious. Otherwise, it works fine (my first light gun/game) and suprise, it works fine on my new 42 inch plasma TV. I thought these things weren't supposed to. I wonder if anyone else has had luck with it working on Plasma? I wonder if it will also work with Time Crisis 3 on my Plasma?"
4,Would have been better if the A and B buttons were closer to the front,"I don't like how the large A and B buttons are too far in the back as they're hard to reach. They'd be much easier to reach had they been placed near the front like they were on the Guncon 1 (although holding a real gun ""Guncon 1 style"" by the barrel is unrealistic). There could have also been a button on the back below the D Pad (as the D pad can be awkward to press in frantic situations if you don't need to press any one direction). The C button on the bottom (where a magazine would go on a real gun) is an excellent addition however."
1,Sorry for the late review but,"Sorry for the late review, it was missing a wire to connect it to the PS2 to the T.v. set, so I had to re-order another gun from someone that had the wire, it would have been alright for the price if it had the wire, I need to read more correctly next time, when it said gun only, I thought probably it came with the wires to as well.Nicole...."
3,Incorrect Picture and lack of Details,"No where on this page does this product list whether it is for a 4-cylinder engine or a 6-cylinder engine. I relied upon Amazon's great vehicle identifier, and the picture, which shows a total of 8 wires.Unfortunately, when I received the spark plug wire set, it was in an entirely different box, and only a wire set for a 4-cylinder engine. Amazon was gracious enough to issue a refund, but if you have a 6-cylinder 4Runner, this set will not work."
1,Didn't fit my car.,These wires had no relation to my car and didn't fit at all. I would have returned them but it wasn't worth the trouble.
4,My infant plays with it.,She uses the teething ring and also chews on Big Bird's nose. It is durable for a baby and is light and not bulky for travel. Small sized which makes it perfect for her to handle.
4,pleasantly surprised....,"I ran across a few of the songs as mp3s online and decided to go check out the cd at the store (and maybe buy it). I'll admit that I was a bit surprised to find out who was in the band! :o) I like the quieter songs but still favour the songs like Swim, Alarming, A Dreamtime and Ememies which have a bit more to offer with good drums and bass. I can honestly recommend it."
4,36 year old reviewer ---Loved it,"I have CD's from other bands that have actors in their mix and so far I haven't been disappointed. this CD felt like an 80's sound with some alternative feel. It is very engaging, I especially love the superstar cover."
2,It rocks,"This CD was such a pain to get my hands on, but when I finally did I was in heaven. [I don't think I spelled that right.] I am a (...) when it comes to keanu Reeves, so I broke down and listened to the Amazon samples. I was hooked and I have been ever since. my favorite songs are: ""Slipping Down"" ""Washington"" ""A Dreamtime"" ""Stagger"" and ""Blown Away"" is great even though it is the last song. I have to say that this CD is worth it. It doesan't matter if you like Keanu Reeves or not. I am still tryin to decide if that is him singing on ""Enemies"" but I may never be able to. I have been telling all my friends about it and have ordered Dogstar's two other CDs. It's the best CD I own and even other people in my family will listen to it so I don't have to hole up in my room."
4,a nice blend of rock,"original songs in that range between soft rock and hard rock,Blown Away, Washington, and Halo are my favorites - a good live band, too."
3,"A good CD, but not really my cup of tea.","This is my first Dogstar CD, and I bought it just because I am a fan of Keanu Reaves (who plays bass). I guess I was expecting music kind of like what you'd hear in an exciting, Matrix-y Keanu Reaves movie, but I was wrong. While this music is good, it is a little light for me. Some songs are kind of heavy, but it is more pop-rock than rock 'n' roll. But if you like light rock music, get it."
4,it's never too late to buy this album,"i first heard this band on a MP3 and instantly fell in love with them. some songs are instantly replayable like ""I'm not giving up on this one"" or ""A story of us"" with sing - a - lond lyrics and great tunes you are guranteed to have a brilliant punk album. the only downer is the fact there is only 8 songs on but it still is a good buy. :)"
2,The Four of the Apacolypse,"LAME... had to force myself to watch it!!! Even considered giving it a one star rating.This really is a creep show in western dress.If you enjoy watching people on peyote trips, people eating flesh, crazies that speak to the dead, women dying from child birth, the misery of severe alcohol addiction, and suffering; you might like this movie.To top it all off it has a really cheesy soundtrack too!!!!The story is.... well I don't think there is a story here other than to illustrate a sadistic view on death and life.Thomas Milan plays a brief part... no doubt to use his name to sell the movie... and does his character well."
4,A Pleasant Spaghetti Oddity,"Of the large body of Italian westerns, many are largely forgotten. For every Sergio Leone, there would have been a dozen or more contenders. Four of the Apocalypse is a real oddity; but one that should be seen by any afficianado of the genre. Way over the top, it is a real hoot. What places this slightly above the others though is the modern documentary included. Not very long but interesting to hear the actor's speak."
3,Different,There are a lot of detailed reviews here so I'll just say that I bought it to add to my Michael J. Pollard movies. I can't say that I enjoyed the movie as much as I had hoped but I'm glad to have it in the collection.
2,Not so great...different though...,"I bought this alongside ""Great Silence"" after viewing ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"", my favorite again, during a resurgence of interest in Spaghetti Westerns.""Silence"" was great (see seperate review) but this one didn't deliver on the hype that surrounded it. I applaud it for it's mostly UN-western approach being a tale of four individuals traveling from a dangerous situation in one town with literally the clothes on their back to the next and their encounters along the way.Chief of which is Tomas Milian's Chaco playing the role of the Western equivalent of a deranged psycho hitchhiker. This is when the film is at it's best, but alas all too briefly.After this high the movie seemed to drag for me until the no-surprise finale that could have been done better.There was a lot of build-up to this I had either heard or read. Like most items of the type you need to see them for yourself. ""Great Silence"" measured up...""Four of the Apocalypse"" didn't."
3,Fulci + Spaghetti Western + Chaco = How could you go wrong,"This is a neat film. It's by no means as violent and portrayed. When the alleged gore is shown, notice the actor for he has been in a lot of Spaghetti Westerns which was kinda neat. Tomas Millian is great as Chaco. ""Do you see how Chaco Shoots?"", and other lines are cool. This is more of a drama if you ask me. Not a lot of action or shoot outs. But it's an entertaining fils. The music is interesting to say the least."
1,What a disaster!,"This movie is an absolute mess. You thought Fulci's horror entries made little sense or were disconnected? Wait to you waste an hour and 45 minutes watching this atrocity. If this is going to be your first foray into the world of Spaghetti Westerns, please, please put the disc back in it's case and get something else, anything but The Four Of The Apocalypse. If you like snail paced movies, if you like westerns with horrific folky/countryish music with lyrics, if you like watching animals die on film, if you enjoy finger paint bloody gore then this movie is for you. If you like excitement, if you like a good Ennio Morricone type scores, if you like clear direction, if you like interesting storylines then this movie is not for you. Avoid."
3,little high priced,"I am pleased with product, thought it was a little over priced for the package I received"
2,I hated it,"I gave this razor two stars because it does work sort of. However, I bought it because there were reviews from women who said it was better than the Venus. I had the VenusGillette for Women Venus Divine Razorand thought somehow the Mach would be better. But it feels awful in my hands. I know that sounds ridiculous as it's just a razor, but the Venus does feel a lot less slippery and just more viscerally pleasant and easier to hold. I felt like I could cut myself easier with the Mach. It just felt creepy to me. I gave it to my husband."
3,Thought it was the one with battery,"Gillette Mach3 Turbo Razor name is misleading. ""Turbo"" does not mean battery like the earlier version (Gillette Mach3 Power). Too bad that model is no longer available. Had great success with it for a long time."
3,Too expensive!,"The problem I've encountered is that the Mach 3 Turbo System gets quite expensive. It is suggested by the manufacturer that you change blades when the blue strip is gone. If I follow this guideline, I end up changing blades about ten times a month. At $15 for 8 blades, that comes to almost $20 per month just in blades! For a shave that's smooth but not as close as I would like, that's a bit much."
1,false advertising,This prodoct says it comes with a razor and two cartridges but when I got it it only had one cartridge !!!!!
4,bought for my teenager,I bought this for my teenage son. He seems to be happy with it and hasn't complained. I like that it had the free shipping.
5,Best. Razor. Ever.,"This is the best razor ever made, I had a 2 inch beard growing outward and this razor shaved off my ENTIRE beard with ease. Even after that I used the same blade for 2 weeks and it was the closest shave I have ever felt. There simply is no better razor than this one, it is a worthwhile investment because the razor will last a long time and provide an extremely close shave, if you get a razor pack with this it should last you months. I never use my electric shaver anymore, believe it or not it is faster to shave with this razor and cuts alot better."
3,Don't miss out....,"Ok, it only gets 3 stars, but that is largely because this book does not deliver like 'Hallucinating Foucault'...however, this remains a compelling read, a wide-ranging story well told, especially the descriptive passages - what it lacks is the sense that the author is fully ""engaged"", almost as if she herself had doubts about book and it's purpose halfway through the writing of it. Set that feeling aside, though, and this will be one of your better reads this year!"
3,needs re-editing,"This book is concise and offers great advice. However, the editing job on it is truly poor. I'm only on page 55 and have found so many spelling errors that I am getting distracted from the message of the book. (p. 52, ""Sam's parents told me he effictively alienated several evening baby-sitters before his farther figured out what was going on."" (you mean ""father?""); p. 42 ""Has too much control - the limited may need to be clarified"" (you mean ""limits""?) p. 43 ""Assessing Your Parenting Shills"" (you mean ""Skills""?)) To the publisher -- you need to have your editor take a closer look at this book."
4,Great Eye Opener and Creator of Hope,"If you're one of those parents trying to figure out who the creature is that you're living with, then this might be a good book to read through. Reading this book has not only helped us in our ability to work with and not against our active alert little boy, but it has also helped me work with my active alert wife.This book is changing the dynamic in our household by giving us ideas on how to work with the natural personality and gifts we've each been given. It gives great hope to not have to think about medicating our child like we so often see today.I'd recommend looking into this book if you have a little one who seems to be exceptionally smart, very active and one to drive you crazy quite often."
4,Good for the Undergrad Students.,"This book has the advantage of applying group theory directly to solvable physical problems. In most areas of applied physics it isvery important to know the basics concepts of group theory, butthere is no need to have a deep knowledge as well as to know how toproof all the main theorems. As an introductory course for undergradstudents this book is well recommended."
3,No noticeable difference,"Running these beautiful babies from a sony progressive scan dvd player produced nothing more than the average grade monster cable quality. In defense of Monster, I must say that there are exceptional players out there (as insanely priced as these cables) and this product may be intended for those types of players which can generate a richer image.The cables themselves are gorgeous."
5,Run With The Horsemen,This book and the two sequels to it sustained our whole family while my grandchild was in the ICU on life support. We all read them as we sat with her around the clock. I love Porter Osborne
2,"Yes, the book was amusing.","Running with the Horsemen does have its amusing moments. But, for me this novel was way too graphic for little purpose that I could see. And it seems to be endless. The readers are subjected to bodily fluids of humans, mules and cows. I found the language the Blacks spoke offensive. I keep waiting for the novel to end. The only reason I keep reading is because our book club chose it."
3,Run with the Horsemen,"Pages were very worn. Advertisement said slightly used. There was writing on the inside cover, pages were yellowed and book was apparently orignally purchased in 1992. NOT COMPLETELY AS ADVERTISED, BUT READABLE"
2,Children's Bedtime Book,"The book is nice but very sleep-inducing. I't wholesome enough for children, so it would make good bedtime reading. While the overall flavor is similar to the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, Run with the Horseman is less successful than that series at eliciting an emotional response from the reader. I never developed an affection for any of the characters."
3,where's the story?,"Though I enjoyed reading this for the most part, I have to agree with another reviewer that the novel was not really a novel. In other words, it read like an interesting narrative. There was no real plot or anything to keep me turning the pages except my desire to finish it because (1) I bought the book (2)I respect Mr. Sams (3) I kept hoping it would surprise me.Overall, the writing is very good; very sharp, descriptive, and fluent prose. The story, however, I found to be somewhat boring. I am often amazed at what passes for ""superb novels."" Seems everytime I read a ""great"" novel, I discover my fiction writing professor in college lied. The beginning did not really interest me, there was not real conflict set up, and there was a lot of telling instead of showing.I was always told ""how to"" textbooks were useless. This book proves it."
5,Americana,"Wonderful narrative of an era in Southern History. Funny, tender and insightful. Also reminds me of my childhood memories."
5,Quality literature!,"This coming-of-age novel is rich. It conveys the nuances of rural Southern culture, as well as the universal joys and problems of growing up."
5,"Besides the Holy Bible, this is the best book ever written",The story of the stubborn mule is a Southern Classic and the funniest event ever put on paper.
5,woooooooow!!!!,"The Excentrics, Yossi Fine, Nana Dazi and crew, have been working in Israel and recently showing in the US for about 4-5 years already, and are one of the best dub groups out there. Yossi Fine is one of the greatest bass players in the world, with a unique sound that's bound to get you hooked, and the rythem section of the group (the Israeli drummer and the three percussion players from Ghana) is simply amazing. The group delivers a blend of dub, african music, funk, electronic music (Yossi Fine's also a DJ) & hip-hop, and whatever kind of music this is, this group is best one making this kind of music _anywhere_. Best grooves you'll ever hear, amazing energy, trust someone who's seen their show over & over again and was amazed each single time. GET THIS!"
2,Sherlocl k holmes Triple Feature,"I am a Sherlock Holmes fan , of this triple set of Holmes , Only one was what I could call Watchable & that was Dressed To Kill , Murder at the Baskervilles with Arthur Wotner as Holmes and A Study In Scarlet with Reginald Owen as Holmes , Were just terrible! , neither one was watchable & the sound is awful! , When ( If Ever ) Are they going to Restore the Sherlock Holmes Films Of Arther Wontner Or Reginald Owen ?? , I for one would gladly pay a premium price for their Sherlock Holm Films restored . William Croce"
5,Weims,If you have a Weim or just fancy their adorable face you have to get a copy of the book. The photos are wonderful. Great coffee table piece.
5,Ancient Sanctuary,"I highly recommend buying this type of booster pack. Nearly every card rocks, even the commons are awesome. If you want to work on a Light-type deck, or just a normal one, you'll lose every time without these. Also, what's everyone's problem? Not long ago, YGO was the most popular thing out there, and now I'm lucky to still be popular because I still like it.P.S. Buy the Exclusive Pack!"
5,Cool,"This pack has some pretty cool cards, thouggh some rares suck(ex: archlord zerato and mazera deville, good effects, but you warrior of zera and either sanctuary in the sky or pandemonium, depending which one. spirt of pharoh sucks completely, although there are some good ones.) also a message to person below me, you get theinen and rare metal dragon in the EXCLUSIVE PACK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Rare cards are awsome, most commons are junk","Ancient Sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us. First, Fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room. Zombies finally have an 1800 attacker. Machines have a mean burn monster. The rares are something else. Soul Resurrection is a Call of the Haunted except the monster goes into defence mode. And it's only a rare! There is also Blowback Dragon, who like his brother, Barrel Dragon, has the same effect. Instead of destroying monsters only, Blowback destroys ANY card on the field. Zaborg the Thunder Monarch is also a plus to this set, destroying any monster on the field when summoned. I got this 5 set and got Gear Golem, the Moving Fortress, Enemy Controller, Draining Shield, Zaborg the Thunder Monarch and Avatar of the Pot. In other words, buy it. This is worth the money."
5,Suitable for 12,"My 12-year-old thought at first glance that it was too simple for him, and was written for someone younger. However, once he started it, I could hardly pry him from it long enough for him to eat. I haven't read it myself, but from merely skimming it, this looks like a very good read for children. My son agrees with me, and we both thanked my sister, who gave it to him."
5,WOW!!!,"This book is great for adults and kids with a little higher reading level. It takes what you know about vikings and adds a twist. A religion of their own based on the life of sailing and fighting. A boys life gets turned around when he meets these interesting characters, learning their ways and at the same time trying to get him and his sister back home to their parents. I know that i absolutely loved the story and i hope that you do to!"
5,Nancy Farmer does it again!,"Nancy Farmer had successfully delved into Norse mythology in her tale of young Saxon Jack and his abduction by Viking warrior raiders. Our young hero is a bard in training and his understanding about the lands and peoples around his small village is sorely tested. He encounters trolls and shape-shifters, and dragons in his attempt to save himself and his younger sister Lucy from captivity. This thoroughly enjoyable epic tale has the reader begging for the second and third installment of Jack's adventure quests. Highly recommended."
4,Great Book.,This book was vary interesting i enjoyed it quite a bit. It is an good read goof for any time and age. Sea of Trolls is a good length making for a good time passer. Farmer dose a great job explaining the characters though some parts are a little had to understand at first. It has some parts that relate to now-day occurrences which make for interesting twists. Over all you will find yourself loving it and enjoying mostly every page. I must say for a little bit is goes a little slow but other than that it is great. I give it 4 1/2 stars.
3,Disappointing read,"I picked up this book because first, it was written by Nancy Farmer who was the author of House of Scorpion (an extremely good book!) and second because it had good reviews. I was disappointed in this book because of the characters. The storyline was all right, Jack's adventure across the sea with the vikings was moderately exciting. I liked the story of trolls, vikings, and Beowulf but thats about the only aspects of the book that kept me reading 'till the end. Jack is an average, not very complex character. His little sister, his dad, and the girl viking are beyond annoying and completely transparent. I hate it when the character traits ruin a good story and thats what basically happened.I recommend to just skip this book and read House of scorpion, but if you are curious, by all means check it out. Maybe you'll like it, hopefully the storyline will intrigue you enough to forgive the stupid cast."
4,Great Book,"This was the first book I had ever read by Nancy Farmer and I loved it. It was great! I warn you that I am about to give a lot away in this review!!!Jack is an apprentice Bard (wizard) on a small island in what is now known as the tip of Scotland. In just the first year of his training he and his angelic little sister Lucy are kidnapped by Wolf-Men. When Lucy is taken prisoner by the Queen of the Wolf-Men, with a threat to sacrifice her, Jack travels to Troll country to find Mimir's Well, or Yggdrassil; the source of all knowledge. Jack goes to that unsafe country with Olaf and Thorgil; one Wolf-Man and one young Wolf-Girl. After many perils and the death of Olaf, Jack and Thorgil make it to the Troll people, and then Yggdrassil, the life force of all people. With the knowledge then possessed by Jack he returns to the evil queen and frees his enslaved sister."
3,Not a Prize Winning Nancy Farmer book,"Or maybe it did win an award but I didn't give it one! I thought this story was only Ok and I probably wouldn't have chosen it if Nancy Farmer wasn't the author. While the history and time period seem interesting, the story itself the fictional story wasn't interesting to me. I enjoy most of her other books so I will be looking forward to any new books she offers. This one just wasn't a story I could be engaged in."
4,A fun read and fairly accurate,"I commend Nancy for writting a young adult novel with a Viking theme. Certainly she did her research and I would say was about 90% accurate for most of the book. Some historical facts were embellished on for drama. One has to keep in mind that this book focuses on a very narrow aspect of the Viking culture, the Berserkers. And in that does not represent the whole sum of the Vikings (who were not all a bunch of mindless brutes).I'm 28 and I enjoyed the book. It flowed fairly well and was an easy read. I sometimes I had to stretch my imagination to visualize a place Nancy was describing, as it could be a little vague.It is worth reading."
5,Farmer Delivers Again,"I read ""House Of Scorpions"" a while back, and Nancy Farmer's skill at depicting real people shines. With her new book ""The Sea Of Trolls"", once again we have real well delineated characters.Jack, who is mistreated by his overbearing father, dotes on his sister Lucy, as does everyone else in the family. Lucy, of course, is a spoiled brat who ""knows she was adopted"" and is waiting for a knight to carry her back to her ""parents"". Her living in a daydream world makes life worse for Jack when in trying to save her from the Viking marauders, she calls out to them because she thinks them to be her rescuing knights.This kind of clever detail makes ""The Sea Of Trolls"" more than just an adventure story about apprentice Bard Jack.The other reviews here mention a lot of the story, but there are many levels to this book, and can be read on several levels.I'm looking for more Nancy Farmer books. This one was a pleasure.--Jerry Wright"
2,Okay...but...,"I was extremely anxious to get this book but I didn't finish it. The story was fresh and well told but it drug on and on and on and on and on. I just lost interest and I don't do that often. If you can borrow it or get it from the library, give it a try. My recommendation is...save your money."
3,The Sea of Trolls,"The Sea of TrollsThis book is very adventurous. The journeys and trips in this book are exsiting and fulfilling. They keep you reading and enjoying it.The book is about a boy named Jack. And he is an adventure, but it's more like he got kidnapped and has to go on and complete the adventure to get home. He meets all sorts of creatures and animals on this adventure, and the adventure is long and hard and he must do a lot to get home.But the book is fine to read, it keeps you wanting to read more and more. It's full of adventure and heroism, but still had some tragedy. I think the book is a good book. It has a lot of imagery and keeps you thinking about what is going to happen next. The Book ""the Sea of Trolls"" by Nancy Farmer, is a really good book. It is for the creative and imaginative. And for people twelve and older I think. It has a great story line and has a great variety of characters. I like it a lot."
2,Extremely Extremely Extremely Disappointing,Sea of Trolls isn't like the reviews at all. The reviews make you think is the best book in the world. I'm a good reader but I had to read some of it twice and I had a terrible time caring at all what happened. Skip Sea of Trolls!
5,Enjoyed it very much,"I liked House of the Scorpion quite a bit (although I wasn't crazy about the ending.) Even so, I was reluctant to read this book. It sounded as though it was written for a younger audience and I thought it would be too ""cutsy.""I was wrong! I thought the author did a great job in writing a fast-paced story with interesting, fairly well-rounded characters. I enjoy 3-D characters who are neither good nor bad, and this book contained a number of them. This book also contains enough serious danger and violence to interest adult readers -- it's not ""cute"" at all.All in all, a fun book that read strangely like fact, even with the mythology thrown in. Another reviewer commented that this book wasn't up to par with Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. I won't argue with that: the Prydain books are classics and a favorite of mine. It's not likely that this book would reach *that* level. Even so, it's quite entertaining and enjoyable. Recommended!"
4,Erica's Review,"I loved this book, and couldn't manage to put it down. The book has a great story line and always keeps you at the edge of your seat. Full of adventure and some comedy The Sea of Trolls is a wonderful book.This book is about a boy named Jack and the trouble he and his sister Lucy have gotten themselves into after being captured by Berserkers, who have taken them across the North Sea far from home. Jack meets lots of unusual people and tons of mythical creatures, along his adventure of finding a way home. He is challenged with many obstacles along this journey all life threatening. But Jack has the upper hand and is more powerful than the average boy. Before he was captured by Berserkers, he was taught magic by an all powerful bard who helped him to stay alive.If you like fantasy books your sure to like this one. It has Myths twisted into Historical fiction to create one great book."
5,Wonderful,Wonderful and enchanting book that can be read at any age and enjoyed. It captured all of my emotions and was carefully made to challenge the views of what is good and bad. Very intriguing.
5,"Great Story, Great Writing","This is a long novel for young adults, but the writing of Nancy Farmer keeps it from becoming a chore. Some authors are self-indulgent when it comes to long novels, but here, the length serves well to tell the story of Jack. Three time Newberry Winner Nancy Farmer proves she can jump from genre to genre. Similar to the Earthsea books by Ursula Le Guin and Tamora Pierce."
1,Childlike prose...simplistic and not authentic.,"I purchased Sea of Trolls because it appeared as a recommmendation from readers of Eldest by Christopher Paolini. I have read many, many books for children and young adults. This book was simply a disappointment in that the prose lacked the embelishment and creativity I would expect from quality children's fantasy novels. Also, the characters' speech was terse, and they did not express ideas realistic to the thoughts and language of Norse antiquity."
4,"Nice backpack, limited volume","This backpack can only fit a small 15"" laptop comfortably and you don't get much room for papers or books. This is good if you want to limit the weight. The finish is good but it is a little bit small for a daily usage."
1,Worst ever,"I've no idea if product works, since it didn't come with a power cord. Also it was the wrong product. It was advertised as an LCD monitor with a built in DVD player. It was only a monitor. Dissapointing seller"
5,Faded after three washes!,We bought this for our daughter and she was in love with it at first. I washed it and after three washes it had faded to the point where it is almost white! It is snagging quite a bit as well. We bought her a Strawberry shotcake one (offered here as well); and it has lasted far better. I cannot reccommend this Barbie one; although it is cute for a few days or if you don't plan to wash it???????????Barbie folks get it right already!
3,Waiting,"I actually purchased one on clearance for $20 at Walmart. I took that one back because it didn't work. It failed the selftest. I exchanged it for a new one and that one failed the selftest too. I contacted the company and they were very agreeable. They gave me an RMA number and asked me to send in the non-working one in exchange for a NEW one with NEW software. I just got it today and it seems to work perfectly. Now I guess I just have to wait to see if it detects ear infections. If you can, I would spend the $20 at Walmart and send it in for one that works. I think it would be a fabulous tool if it turns out it works."
4,Outstanding in the outback,"This is a very good novel set in the rugged Australian outback. The body count mounts as India Kane tries to find out who killed her best friend since childhood--even for a while when she is the primary suspect. The ending seemed rushed and a bit contrived, but I'll definitely want to read more offerings from this author."
2,Not impressed,"Not really an improvement over standard Mach 3 Cartridges, and certainly not worth the price jump. The shave quality still does not match that by an ""old-fashioned"" safety razor."
2,"Expensive, doesn't compare to single blade","These 'cartridges' sell for about $2 a piece, plus shipping. I recently switched from the Mach 3 Turbo to a Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor and I can safely say I will never go back. The Mach 3 provides a decent enough shave (much better than an electric, in my experience) but the single blade is actually much smoother. I pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the Mach 3 at $1.50-$2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days."
1,Cut face product,"Having used/purchased this product at my local retailer many times, I am well accustomed to this product. This is the first time I've purchased this product on Amazon, and it will surely be my LAST! I have called the US manufacturer, and they have asked that I return it to them, so I will! They have repeatedly scratched / cut my face as though used or not of the quality I'm used to...those made here in the US, not abroad! Beware of this product!!"
2,Not the greatest.,"This product might do for a backpacking weekend with the Boy Scouts, but compared to a blade razor, or even an electric, it leaves a lot to be desired. I recommend giving it a pass."
1,dull razors,"These razors were sold as new and in a new looking box, but were extremely dull. I've had very used razors more sharp than these. So it scares me that they are used because of the transmission of diseases such as hepatitis that can survive outside the body for weeks. Very dissatisfied, please look somewhere else for this product!"
4,So close to perfect.,"I'm still looking for the perfect razor. The Mach3 Turbo comes close, though. I've been using it daily (or nearly so) since its debut. It works, and it gets the job done. It rarely nicks me, but I do still get skin irritation. Down under my jawline, I still feel scraggly by the end of the day, but it's not too bad.I know this sounds like a bad review, but it really isn't. I mean, it's tough to get excited about shaving, but at least the Mach3 Turbo has me shaving every day,if you want to shave with a blade, this is the blade for you."
3,I believe good product,"Not used yet. Hope it is genuine gillette product. It came as promised, but it took too long (3 weeks after the order)."
5,Songs from her heart,"I have never heard a lady sing so beautiful, like Loretta Lyn does. She has the voice of an angel,singing these songs,just like she would be singing them personally to God. The song The Third Man, will make you cry, because it is true all the words in it. How Great Thou Art has never been sung before,with so much love,and realism like she does it. There will never be another singer who could touch the voice of Loretta Lyn. She is the best lady country singer we ever had. I do own her original album."
5,CRYSTAL CLEAR PICS FOOL PROOF,"ANY ONE CAN TAKE GREAT PICS WITH THIS JEWEL OF TECHNOLOGY,EASY TO OPERATE AND IF YOU PUT IT IN CONTINUOS SHOOTING MODE YOU GET AWESOME PICS AS FAST AS YOU CAN PRESS THE SHUTTER, NICE HEFTY BATTERY THAT LASTS A LONG TIME, THIS IS TRULY A MINIATURE DSLR LIKE CAMERA AND OF COURSE IS EQUIPPED WITH LEGENDARY GERMAN lEICA LENS AND PANASONIC TECHNOLOGY YOU JUST CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS HONEY..GET ONE YOU'LL ENJOY IT FOR MANY YEARS."
3,"Better, But Still Predictable","The third in Truman's ""Murder in Washington"" series is better than the first two, but not much. The plotting is familiar: well-known figure killed in a capital landmark -- this time the Supreme Court, female attorney works the case, and turning the pages yields a half dozen viable suspects. Most readers will have narrowed the field to one or two candidates with fifty pages left, and those who have read Truman before will have no trouble predicting the end. However, ""Supreme Court"" is better than ""White House"" and ""Capital Hill"" because Truman has done more homework and gives us more background. Fewer DC restaurants and more peeks inside the Supreme Court. A good book, not a great one."
4,suspenseful,"""Murder In the Supreme Court"" is a suspenseful book. A young man by the name of Clarence Sutherland is discovered sitting in the Chief Justice's chair with a hole in his head. Who would want to kill such a bright and handsome young man? Practically everybody wanted to kill him.Margaret Truman does a remarkable job of going in to great detail of describing the scene of the crime, a room in a house and the conversation people are having. The ending of the book is weak, but other than that it is an excellent book."
1,"Merriam-Webster's Spell Checker, Macintosh version","The last System Requirement shown on the box states "" . . . a compatible text processing program."" It is only when you read the Read Me file on the CD that you find out the only compatible program listed is Microsoft Word for the Mac. The Merriam-Webster web site (www.Merriam-Webster.com) is more specific: ""Microsoft Office, including [Microsoft]Word (6.x and 7.x)."" The manual installation procedure (there is also an automatic setup) tells you to replace your word processor's dictionary file with this one. This may be a good world processing program. Great, even. But it may also be a dictionary file, limited to use with Microsoft Word. (PC users will find it is used with Microsoft and Lotus products -- see the Mirriam-Webster web site for their list.)"
1,Limited usage,"Don't wast your money on this spell checker. You will get some new words added to your existing checker (you could add them yourself)It's not really a spell checker, it is an add on to the spell checker you already have."
4,angles and curves,The angles and curves of stregth and weakness is worth the price of the course 5 times over. Has allot of ideas that were lost to time but are very reliable even in todays market.
5,LeAnn is the BEST!,"Of all the songs she has done, this is one of my favorites. You can sing along to the simple lyrics, and the music is relaxing. Its a great one to add to your collection."
5,Twinkle Twinkle really shines,My 3 year old son has practically worn out the cassette and now we're looking for the CD. I think he likes it better than all the other kids tapes because the songs are sung by other children. Everyone knows kids relate better to other kids. He sings the songs (his version) all the time whether the tape is around or not.
4,The Circle at the Top,"One of the problems with growing older in a youth-worshipping culture is that so few ears seem to hear what you wish to tell them anymore. Certainly, one of the frustrations of the author of this remarkable text must be that people just don't seem to ""GET IT""; indeed, given the volumnous detail and the magnitude of ethical/moral reflections woven throughout the glorious fabric of this composition, Carroll must agonize, daily, that her message has fallen upon deaf ears. But I'm pretty sure I understand exactly what she's trying to shout and whisper to the world in which she lives.The dinosaurs continue to disappear as time moves on. The dead don't care and the ones who think they're living have it so pitifully wrong, most times. And the anguish of a broken heart still recognizes no metes-or-bounds.Read this book. Then, go back and study it. Put away those things that really don't matter for a while. Jordan Carroll deserves your attention. She certainly has mine."
5,Prophetic Worship -- par excellance!,"I read the first review and have NO idea what that person expected from this CD. But Cloud By Day is one of the most powerful prophetic cds out and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in prophetic music...especially edgy, ""out of the box"" music. And besides, the quality of its instrumentation and vocals is super as well."
5,Cloud by Day,"awesome music, great way to enter the presence of the Lord. refreshing and a growth experience all in this cd."
1,cloud by day-prophetic worship,"With all due respect to the artists and worshippers involved in what I am sure was a great investment, this cd was a considerable disappointment. The words ""prophetic worship"" carry significant weight and should be used with great care.I encourage that this cd be sampled before purchasing and hope that others disagree."
5,Encyclopedia of Asian Birding,"This is the ultimate reference on birding sites of the continent!It gives coverage to every single Asian country including the Middle East (but not Russia), lists their endemic species with tips on where to see them, and describes the major birdwatching locations with species lists, basic maps, transport and accomodation info. Particularly useful for countries which aren't covered by separate guides."
5,Totally delivers what is promised!!,Steve Morse does a fantastic job of emulating the various styles of his favorite guitarists while still maintaining enough originality to make it his own. The variety makes is very fun to listen to.
2,Baseball Music Review,Was looking for music to play at Baseball Month at a event of senior citizens. Did not have the standard traditional music you would expect from this selection. Music is modern perhaps very young folks might enjoy it. I bought the Ken Burns Soundtracks and that had the traditional baseball music and the event people loved it.
2,Waste Of Time,"Call me crazy, but when listening to a collection called AXE MEN, I would expect the guitar to be prominently featured on each track. What was I thinking?! For example, is there any guitar at all on ""Don't Send Me No Flowers"", attributed to Jimmy Page?? Meanwhile, Russ Pay (who?) performs Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"", sounding like any one of a million Zeppelin cover bands. The selection of artists ranges from legends such as Page, Clapton, Beck, Santana, B.B. King & Hendrix (not all legendary performances, mind you) to a few I've never even heard of. This one is hardly even worthy of the bargain bin."
5,Crying in the dark,"I really love this album and the song ""crying in the Dark"" is a heart warming song to me. I was going through some things and listening to this song i felt alot better cause no one knew that I was Crying in the dark and that touched my heart. I cryed some more, but this is a good cry."
2,The CD doesn't contain most of the best music from the movie,"I bought this thinking it would have the movie's excellent versions of a lot of famous old songs and got a lot of very pleasant background music. If you compare the soundtrack list on IMDB against this CD, you'll see what I mean.Some of the missing music:""Isn't This A Lovely Day""""Lovely To Look At""""Can't Help Loving That Man""""Where Or When""""You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me""""Anything Goes""Obviously this is my fault for not having done more research.Yes, Isreal K's performance of 'what a wonderful world' is on this disk, personally I'd recommend you get one of his CDs."
5,What a WONDERFUL soundtrack! I never get tired of listening,"Great composition of songs with so much passion! It's melodies are truly beautiful.A variety of songs for all kinds of moods...the only other soundtracks that made me feel this way are ""Out of Africa"" and ""Somewhere in Time"". This one is definitely my favorite CD. I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.com -- the music shops didn't have it in stock."
5,loved this album,"After seeing the movie again, I really wanted the soundtrack. I am so glad I ordered it. wonderful music, wonderful sound. Brings back the feeling of watching the movie."
5,awesome song by isreal kamakawiwoole,"Just wanted to say thanks to the movie's producers for including Isreal Kamakawiwoole's song ""Somewhere over the rainbow / What a wonderful world"" in the movie. It gives us people in Hawaii something to be proud of. Although Isreal is no longer with us, I know he's smiling at us from up in Heaven."
3,Good for the price,They are what you think they are and they do what they were designed to do. Good price!
2,Beeing a youn actor in London,"Martin doesn't catch your emotions. Its portrait of a young actor in pursuit of success in every field of its life -professionally and personally- is very detailed, but it leaves you indifferent, cold, distant... Neither the story nor the way is written makes it a great book. The relationship between the main character and its lover is the most interesting subject."
5,Cool and Refreshing,"Unlike other gel aftershaves, Gillette Series dries to a nice clean finish without a greasy residue. But it doesn't dry out your skin either and is very refreshing. It doesn't burn or irritate your face like most liquid after shaves, but provides a long lasting coolness, and also soothes any razor burn. And you can also use it between shaves to tone up your skin. I think it's a very good product!"
1,you can get in walgrens cheaper,you can get in walgreens cheaper look in the stores...get out you can find this product cheaper at other places to
5,Unblievable artist and music. . .,"I first heard Michael O'Brien on TBN singing ""One and Only"" to an all female audience at a woman's conference. I haven't heard a voice like this in a long while. The words and the tune were orignal and fascinating to hear. So many songs today are copies of other songs. This is unique. The song kept going around in my head until I found it and could listen to it over and over. The other songs on the Album are great too. Michael O'Brien is a superb composer, musician, and vocalist. Once you hear the CD, ""Something About Us"", you will want more of his musical style and voice."
4,Very Good,"New CD arrived in original wrap. Delivered in less than 5 days. Recommend this CD for those who are romantics and enjoy music with a nostalgic flavor. Although I was introduced to this CD through a Christian radio talk show, the CD is not overtly religious. Great anniversary gift whether you're religious or not."
5,Old Style Romance,"Wonderful, old style romantic music that transports you to another place and time. Seems like the perfect sound track for a 1930s-50s romantic movie. Very relaxing and heart warming. The message of whole hearted love and devotion to one's spouse and still so romatic...love it!!"
1,No color illustrations,"Don't buy this book, Om the front page they say there are color illustrations, but there are only very badly copied black and white illustrations in this book."
3,Not quite what you think,"I was toying up between this book and Equine Fitness,( I bought both books) I went on the reviews and high hopes however once the article arrived I was quite dissapointed in this book, there are no colour photographs making it hard to see what actually happens, and the book feels and looks cheap, it does have some interesting message/manipulation techniques but as I have not tried them yet won't know how well they work ( I am sure they will benefit) but the title promissed me something a little more than what I got, ""connecting from the ground"" up I had hoped it had more information on inhand work rather than techniques to losen muscles at a stand still..Equine Fitness on the other hand is a great book, clear consise (has drawings and no photos) but illustrates it very wel, and I think a must have book for all riders"
5,The best spark plug gapping tool going!,This spark plug gap tool is of excellent quality. Great price and quick shipping. Makes gapping plugs a breeze. Very solid and made in the USA.
2,Trip on the Low Seas,"This was neither a good romance nor a good mystery, just a mixed up story of dysfunctional people. I got so tired of Rita squelching her wants for her sister and mom's failures. Why she had to carry the burden of their problems was maddening. But all's well that ends well if you can plow through this soap opera. Give it a pass."
4,hard to find,"I don't know what the deal is, but this soundtrack rocks and is impossible to get!All the tracks are great but it's also the only way to get the song :""walls come down"" from the ending which was a spectacular marriage of film and song at the end. HEY! this movie is very well done, but share the wealth by increasing availability of the soundtrack...PLEASE"
3,Roman a clef in need of an editor,"Having knowledge of the circumstances and individuals that the author used in developing this thinly disguised account of the politics and legal wrangling that surrounded the Beryl Buck trust, there are some fun moments in this novel. However, bad editing, weird capitalizations and other just plain sloppy errors made it too distracting to really enjoy."
2,Tommy's most indifferent and insipid album ever.,This very weak and insipid salsa romantica album went nowhere- and deservedly so as it's definitely Tommy's weakest project ever. The production and material are so bland and tasteless that were Tommy Olivencia and his orchestra not credited you'd think this was just another generic salsa romantica record. Don't ask- don't buy!
1,rip off,"THIS CANNOT BE A REAL DVD. THEY USE WOODY""S NAME TO DRAW YOU IN. JUST TWO HASSIDIC MEN TALK ON A BENCH ABOUT NOT MUCH OF ANYTHING. REAL SHORT DVD. I FELT RIPPED OFF. SHOULD HAVE RETURNED BUT JUST THRU AWAY. FFFFFFF---------"
5,Ambitious Effort,"Linda Davis sang background vocals for Reba McEntire and has often sang duets with her. On I'M YOURS, a collection of old songs and new, she proves why she should be as big a star as Reba. Linda has a great country voice, and an ear for great songs. The title track was a mild hit in 1998, it's a great ballad. Many of her songs have great stories, such as ""Love Didn't Do It"", or ""Love Story In The Making"". ""Three Way Tie"" is an excellent country ballad about a love triangle. ""What Do I Know"" is another excellent ballad, and ""In Pictures"" is very moving about a man who has to watch his kids be raised...through pictures. ""I Wanna Remember This"" is a fun uptempo song, and ""Some Things Are Meant To Be"" is an older hit that still sounds great. Overall a strong set of songs."
3,A matter of taste,"This has been my first experience of Sonic Youth -- obviously very much after the fact but so what? Well, this is quite harsh and unrelenting stuff. I'm sure it's first rate in its genre, but I was put off by the consistently aggressive, discordant sound.It's possible to admire some music without ever feeling the need to listen to it. For me, Evol is very much in that category. No doubt that makes me a philistine.Meanwhile, look around this web page and you will see very little effort among the customer reviewers to provide a balanced critique of Evol. It's 5 stars, as usual, as far as the eye can see."
5,An absolute masterpiece,"An absolute masterpiece of rock and surely one of the top rock albums of all time. Taking Glenn Branca's teachings into the punk three-minute song arena, Sonic Youth have produced what can only be called a Dream Factory, churning out sound explosions that will carve their own way into your skull.Brilliant ..."
5,so perfect,"you can't go wrong with sonic youth. their execussion & expression is brilliant. ""evol"" is yet another masterpiece of theirs. bow down!"
3,Not their greatest,"This cd is good but not great. The production is poor which denies the band to fulfill their sonic sound potential which they would later produce on albums like 'goo'. The best tracks here are the haunting, whispered masterpiece 'Shadow of a doubt' and the acidy 'Green Light'. After this not much as the band overindulge with their instruments while the production is so shoddy it doesn't sound the finished project. If you're a sonic youth head help yourself and enjoy but if you're an outsider it's not really worth the listen('Shadow of a doubt' aside) go and buy 'Goo' instead."
5,no doubt here,"sonic youth's earliest years don't let you down like some many great bands did. ""evol"" is a 39 min journey of 10 tracks of whirling guitars, off-melody vocals and screeching, noisy guitar feedback. it's an experimental guitarist's wonder. it is the first step in sonic youth's successful, long, LONG career, and still going."
5,Beautiful,"Beautiful song-craftmanship, a clean shimmering sound which immediately envelopes the lisener...a very accessable release for those new to SY, and a great change of pace for the afficionado...definitely a unique recording among their prolific output."
5,Minor correction to Karen's excellent review,"Charles recorded ""In a Grand Style"" in 1992, around the time of his 70th birthday. In all other respects, Karen's review is bang on.It's currently my favourite album of the many thousands I own. 'Nuff said."
2,Campy and awkward,See Serizawa's later books. This was a flawed early attempt. He did better with his Tsubo and Acupuncture books. Even he realized this as it is not listed amongst his publications in his later works.
3,Human Drama,"A Shakespeare coloured atmpsphere from a band that's hard to imagine touring around Los Angeles. We miss ""There is Only YOu"" in the collection."
1,Avoid,I had the exact same problem with this light as the above reviewer. The top lamp broke--only the reading lamp still works.
1,Unreliable - defective,"I had purchased 2 of these lamps a few years ago. One works fine, one has the exact same symptoms that the previous 2 reviewers have. Unreliable at best."
2,How to Dance through Time Vol I,"I am very disappointed with this tape. It was obviously a very low budget effort. To me, the tape appears to have been shot with a home camera with the microphone mounted on the camera. During the initial introduction, the sound quality was VERY BAD. One could barely hear the lady giving the introduction. Then, during the instructional portion of the tape, someone was playing a piano in the background. Good idea but, the already bad audio plus the piano was too much. (I could not hear a work she was saying)."
2,"Very Dated, Expensive",This book is very small and dated and the information is limited. There are very few photos and the price is also very high. The book was purchased based on a glowing review. The reviewer clearly is inexperienced or knows the author.
3,Not as much repair info as I had wanted.,"This book tells you a lot of information about the history of Black Forest Cuckoo Clock making and is very interesting. It does go into repair, but not in the depth that I had hoped for."
4,"Great show, poor dvd quality","Love Xena and will watch it anyway I can. But the DVD series is poor picture quality. I could be watching it on vhs for all it is worth. In one episode, the voice track doesnt match up with the actual ""talking"" of the characters. For the money, not worth it on DVD. For the series itself, worth it. I hope when the next season gets released, the supposed digital video is enhanced and the soundtrack is on target."
5,Xena fan,I am a true die hard xena fan and was extremely sad to see it end in such a way as it did. But it was one of the best shows on TV. I also thankful to all the people who thought that they should start a sort of spin-off to Herc.
2,Xena: Warrior Princess Seanson One,"The picture is a little disappointed. There are lot of static on every disc. Sorry, but I regretted that I bought those disc."
3,For those good times,"As a low cost re-release my expectations were not very high, still I think the CD's could have been better, the print on the disks is a cheap red and although they used the circle shape as a chackram they could have used a gold ink to add a great touch. The inside has no booklet or anything, which is a shame since it's the 15 anniversary of the series. The main screen is plain, as the menus...just the episodes no extras or bloopers.Still the show what is the important thing looks good, not great just good.I didn't like the subtitles, for me they are too big and messy...But what counts is the show and I hope they re-release the whole series, because it would be sad to have only season one."
4,Xena Warrior Princess,"Some shows it seems are worth looking over and some are not. Xena is an exception, the lady in leather is always fun and the show always poked fun at itself in a campy sort of way. I enjoyed the TV series and was disappointed when it was cancelled. I thought the show was far more superior to Hercules as a spin off show. The difference with Xena is that this show delivers all the right punches at the right time. Xena (and Hercules) both represented a new departure in television as well. So, if you enjoy camp, adventure or just want to escape from reality for awhile this is fun show and Xena shows always end up on a happy note. (Even with Callisto around!!)"
2,Where are the subtitles?,"I'm a big fan of Xena and i only have to say one negative thing about this DVD and that would be that they did not include subtitles. Almost every popular tv series on DVD has subtitles and why would they not, they must be cheapies. Subtitles do a lot of help if the sound is bad or if there are deaf people out there that want to watch it too and they are stuck with not buying their favorite tv series on DVD. Plus, i think they could sell more copies for including subtitles. Hopefully, in the near future subtitles will be included in their other Season sets or this will be a big disappointment not only for me but many other people out there."
1,"loved the series, hated the DVD encoding","There's been a lot of stuff, both positive and negative, about the Anchor Bay package of Xena on DVD. I've been watching it on a very good quality all-regions player (which has no trouble with other NTSC progs) in the UK and it's frequently awful. The soundtrack (which should be glorious) is disastrously out of synch from time to time (The Titans, Prometheus for example) and picture quality varies from OK to really awful. Don't believe anyone who tells you it's because Series 1 was shot on 16mm film instead of 35mm: believe me, 16mm should look terrific on the small screen. And there's no excuse for the out-of-synch-sound or poor quality DVD encoding.On the plus side you get loads more extras than the meagre Universal/Playback versions available on this side of the pond, but at least the Universal DVD's are watchable.A great series and good package spoiled by very poor quality control."
2,Not worth it...a sure let down,Pretty packaging doesn't make up for terrible video. Don't waste your money on a grainy blur...you'll get better picture quality recording the re-runs on tv.The least Anchor Bay could have done was to have made this much awaited DVD set a quality product...
1,Very poor release of a great season,I have a region-free DVD player and bought the Australian release of Xena Season 1 because I was so disappointed with the picture and sound quality of this Anchor Bay release. The Australian version does have a few slightly grainy moments but nowhere near as bad as the Anchor Bay version. Now I'm stuck with an inferior quality set to get rid of. A person would be better off with taped episodes of Season 1 from a satellite or cable.
4,About Time,"I miss seeing the episodes anymore, so this is the best way to get a Xena fix. I liked the 2nd season better than the first though, because of the commentation. But this set is a great way to have a copy of all the episodes in the season."
4,great show,"Sins of The Past- 8/10Chariots of War- don't rememberDreamworker- 7/10Cradle of Hope- 9/10The Path Not Taken- 6/10The Reckoning- 6/10The Titans- 8/10Prometheus- 9/10Death in Chains- 7/10Hooves & Harlots- 10/10The Black Wolf- 3/10Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts- 5/10Athens City Academy of the Performing Bards- 6/10A Fistful of Dinars- 4/10Warrior...

3,Love Xena! Hate the DVD Quality.,"I was very excited to finally get Xena on DVD. I was a late comer to the show and was anxious to see and own the series. However, the sound and picture quality of these DVDs are very disappointing. I have some experience with DVD compression and sound and I can say the makers of the set did a horrible job. It's worse in the ""dark"" scenes where pixelation is so prevalent, it's like looking at a grainy movie from the silent picture days. The VHS versions would have been better. I just hope that whatever company they hired to make the DVDs gets fired before the other seasons come out."
4,XENA LOVER and xboxer,This is the mostly serious season where my favorite season is the musicals. Disappointed when I tried to watch via xbox which I have been able to do with other amazon titles unsupported. XENA is always 5 of 5 stars. Amazon gets the -1 star [...] lol.
5,No One Says No To A Woman In Leather!,"Xena Warrior Princess Season One is the start of the epic saga that headed the television ratings for the better part of 90s.Starring Lucy Lawless this series follows her's and her sidekick's adventures through the mythical age of Greece. It blends a harmonious mixture of comedy, friendship, love, and heart stopping action. You will feel like you are a part of the story of the most powerful women in the ancient world.Sword fighting, flipping, acrobatic fight scenes, great actors, and a epic story make this a must for anyone who loves to see women kicking butt and taking names. Great product and Great series, you never want to see it end. It is a must have!"
3,Fantastic season - Poor DVD Quality,"Although season one is my favorite, I've found the dvd picture quality to be very grainy - like a transfer from an old VHS tape. The packaging is very impressive, but I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of these DVDs."
4,"Good for TV, not great for laptop","I just received my DVD yesterday. All in all, it's great to finally have Xena on DVD, and I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out on DVD.The sound and video are great when I watch the episodes through my regular television set, putting the disc in my DVD player.But I'm a big fan of watching DVDs on my laptop. It has a high definition plasma screen, and I guess I've just been spoiled by the Fellowship of the Ring. But the Xena DVDs end up looking distractingly pixelated when I watch them on my laptop.But that's the only drawback I've found. It's been two years since Xena went off the air, and each season just gets better. So lets get the rest of these Xena seasons out on DVD!"
2,Picture is grainier than cornflakes,"You'll cry your eyes out. No, not tears of joy, silly! It's the result of a 24-episode visit from the incredibly blinding ""Grain Monster"" of planet ""Anchor Bay Entertainment Butchered This Set"". If you were worried about not getting enough grain in your diet, folks, worry no longer. Yes, grain, grain, and more grain permeates every disc of this set like some kind of terrible, grainy plague. Remember the movie ""A Christmas Story"" when everyone told the kid, ""You'll shoot your eyes out""? Well, same deal here -- except in this case you'll WANT to shoot your eyes out after having received even only 3 seconds of this visually painful jolt to the old optic center of the brain. The audio is great, the content we all know and love is there, the packaging -- superb, but without good picture, who really cares, right? Buy it if you're a die-hard fan, otherwise, beware!"
3,Video is awful,"Contrary to what platoshrimp says, the progressive scan issue is not a factor here. Whoever transferred this to DVD simply did a terrible job, made even more deplorable by the cost. Shots with a lot of motion show a lot of compression artifacts, and those with little motion are grainy. Sure, the shows are fun, but there's no excuse for quality this poor in DVDs, especially at this price point. It's some of the worst I've ever seen in a DVD. Stargate SG-1 seasons are 2/3 the price of Xena and have excellent quality video and good extras. I'll probably sell the season after I've watched it simply because the video quality is so disappointing."
3,Poor picture quality ruins the experience,"I was thrilled to receive my Xena Season 1 DVDs, but have also found the poor picture quality really irritating. I'm also using a brand-new, high-end progressive scan DVD player, but with an older, ""interlace"" TV. I realize progressive scan is basically meaningless in this context; I guess that makes all the difference. The darker scenes are so grainy as to be unwatchable -- as in, I literally can't make out the actors' faces -- but even the bright, outdoor scenes look like they were filmed with a coating of vaseline over the lens. I also noticed the lack of audio-video synchronization in ""The Titans."" Of course, I'm chalking it all up to the general sense of cheesy fun that pervades this series, particularly the early seasons. Overall, I'm still glad I bought the DVDs."
1,The Pits,"This is the worst adventure story I've ever seen. Third rate acting, a fourth-rate script, ridiculous genre mixing that only an adolescent could love. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,As much as I like Xena,"I'm deaf and this DVD set didnt have caption or subtitles. I've been a hardcore nutball Xena fan from day one,and NONE of the VHS or DVD tapes have yet to have caption or anything of the sort. It is disappointing, I bought a 90 dollar DVD set, just to find out it wasnt captioned, and sent it back to only get 30% of what I paid for it. Many hardcore...and deaf, xena fans just like myself were disappointed, really disappointed, and season 2 shows no different. For you deaf people out there, do NOT get it! Unless you like just watching the action and not understanding or being able to see Xena's wisdom in caption, or subtitle, just like the hearing people can."
5,No problem with this fan.,"I couldn't wait for Xena to be released on DVD and especially the entire season in package form. I was not disappointed at all. I had purchased ten of the first episodes from another supplier and the problem with picture quality was about the same. But this edition is far better. The sound quality is excellent, and the disc display is wonderful.So I say, if you want Xena...buy this. It's wonderful."
3,16MM filming is not the problem,"Although the season 1 episodes are great, the picture quality is quite awful. I have read a lot of excuses about the problem being caused by filming on 16MM rather than 35MM. If you would like to see how good it should have looked, I invite you to view Buffy the Vampire Slayer Seasons 1 and 2, both of which were shot in 16MM ... and have picture quality vastly superior to this. It looks like someone did the conversion on a home computer and then converted it to disc. I sincerely hope that subsequent seasons have markedly improved quality, as I love Xena."
5,Xena Warrior Princess Season 1,I am a huge Xena fan and I plan on buyng the entire Season I am sooo pleasedwith this iteam and I am actually Pleased that it was brand new like I orderedthere were no tricks and I actually go it. I am very pleased with my seller andI will be buying the rest of the series through him. Kudos to Josh. aka youlikethat
4,OK Fine By Me,"Ok, I was a little hesitant after reading some of the negative comments previously submitted, but I bought it anyway. And I haven't been disappointed. I don't have top-of-the-line equipment (I watch it on a TV with a regular DVD player), and there were some grainy scenes (usually in scenes with dull lighting), but they were few and far between. And I didn't have any problems with the audio, either. The only real complaint I have (and maybe it's a small one), is that at least a couple of episodes (Prometheus, Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts) left me with the nagging suspicion that some of the original material had been cut out (I'm thinking 10 seconds worth or more). I don't know why. And that's just what I noticed; perhaps all the episodes were cut short. Or not. Still, it nags me.But I'm still glad I bought it."
2,Music Overload,"Too bad that the voices are almost completely obscured by the music. I've tried the DVD in each of my DVD players and and the 5.1 system in the family room. Miserable audio, I guess I should have taken a lip reading class before ordering Season One"
2,Xena Anchor Bay versus this release,Everyone stick with Anchor Bay of any Xena seasons as this is a poorer copy. 2 stars is for DVD quality not show as show is 4 stars. Bought season 1 & 2 as my Anchor Bay season 1 one of the disks were defective & wouldn't play at all. When I compare picture quality of Anchor Bay to this one is obviously poorer quality
2,What happend to the video transfers? Awful picture quality,"I don't know what happened here, I love Xena so I bought this set, I give it 2 stars just because it is Xena, however, this is about the worst picture quality I have seen on dvd, there is grain everywhere, so much so in some scenes that it is annoying to watch. I don't know what the quality of the sets on the Xena website is like but they can't be worse than this. I only hope that Anchor Bay gets it right the next time, and improves for Season 2, as well as the upcoming Hercules season. A terrible disappointment overall, don't listen to other reviews saying the video quality is great, you will be disappointed."
4,Not Complete without the Closed Captioning or Subtitles,"I am a huge fan of Xena and was very disappointed that this DVD series haven't been encoded with Closed Captioning nor offered English subtitles. The majority of new media releases contain these features and the television even aired it with Closed Captioning as well as the finale DVD, so why would they exclude that in the season series? The pictures are great, but since I'm hard of hearing I need the story line to go with the pictures in order to fully experience Xena/Gabrielle, their adventures and spiritual growth. I will be holding off from buying any future Xena Season DVDs until someone produces them with CC or Subtitle features."
4,"good image quality, no matter what other reviewers say","I bought this DVD set thinking that I'd have problems with the image quality - but there was none at all! It was all crisp and clear, with good colors. If you have a decent DVD player, you shouldn't have a problem.Season One of Xena: The Warrior Princess is action-packed, and introduces a lot of the favorite characters that recur in later seasons... Xena and Gabrielle, of course, but also Ares, Joxer the Mighty, Callisto, and let's not forget the Amazons.The only problem I have with this set is that some of the episodes seem to be out of order. Unless you're a hardcore fan, however, you probably won't notice, and I still am just glad to have it on DVD.I'm giving this four stars because it's not quite perfect. Also, you might want to wait until they release the new Season One DVDs that will include commentary on three episodes (there's already commentary on the upcoming Season Two)."
1,Can you hear my disappointment?,"I was thoroughly disappointed to find that these DVD's did not include closed captions nor subtitles. I have enjoyed watching the various Xena episodes over the years on TV where the CC's were broadcast. It's unfortunate that in the year 2003, when the technology is readily available, that so little regard is given the paying customer. I am one of the millions of hearing impaired persons that like to buy and view DVD's. I would certainly 'not' purchase any DVD in the future that did not contain either closed captions or subtitles. (At least foreign films, with non-English dialogue allow the viewer the opportunity of reading English subtitles.) If they want to sell more DVD's and be a 'responsible' company, then they need to do it 'right'."
2,Disappointing pronunciation guide,"I chose this dictionary because it lists the pronunciation for the French words right next to them. I speak French, but my husband does not; I wanted him to be able to share this book with our young son, who is learning French.The book has a brief pronunciation guide in the front. It is woefully incomplete and hard to use; the English words selected to give an idea of the pronunciation of some French vowels are words which are pronounced very differently by English speakers in different countries and areas. If you don't already know how to pronounce those vowels, you'll be forced to guess.The pronuciations listed in the dictionary itself are misleading. They don't even match up with the guide in the front of the book.I'm giving this book three stars because the illustrations are charming and old-fashioned, and the book does appeal to my son. However, it's not useful to me, and I'm returning it."
2,What did she say?,"Baby Lia is a beautiful doll and my 2 year old instantly fell in love. Unfortunately, we cannot understand a word that Interactive Lia says. As mentioned in the other review, Lia speaks French as her primary language and requires one of three bracelets to speak English, Spanish, or Italian. Our English bracelet causes Lia to speak Spanish. We cannot separate our daughter from Lia long enough to send her back for a replacement. She would be devastated. C'est la vie!"
4,My daughter's favorite,"My 2.5 year old daughter became obsessed with this doll after seeing a video on the Corolle web site. We got it for her so we could stop playing that video! Lia is now her favorite doll. She makes lots of fun sounds, but the sounds turn off after a reasonable amount of time, so I don't find Lia annoying. She has a good weight and a nice soft body. My only complaint is that the bracelets for choosing the language don't stay on very well. I was afraid we would lose the English one and it would be a tragedy after my daughter was used to her speaking English, so I put it away and now Lia just speaks French."
5,AWESOME! Classic Surf Guitar that rocks!,"The Torquays shoot the tube right out of the Southern California shoreline and on to CD in this superb recording. From classics you'll instantly recognize, this all Surf Guitar instrumental is a ""GOTTA HAVE ONE"" for the CD shelf! Whether you are a musician who digs incredible guitar playing, or a surfer who wants some tunes to hit the waves with, this is THE CD to have!"
3,"If you really like Punisher or Marvel you should watch this, but if not I would advise against it.","This movie although it is not terrible, it gets a little goofy at times. I can say this isn't the true Punisher, but it is one version of him. I would get it if you are a die hard comic fan."
3,punished,"i always though dolph lundgren had the better look of the punisher. script could have been better, but it was close. in a way i still enjoyed it."
3,punisher,this dudes family gets wasted in front of him so he goes on a murderous rampage vs organized crime.the punisher is played by the russian dude from rocky 4.this ones more than the kids can handle.especialy the kidnapping parts.his enemy?the jap mob!the real deal is they could have done better but they didnt do bad!
3,Good for what it is and isn't.,"The Punisher seeks revenge on the the mobster who killed his family. The Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) step in to take over. They then kidnap the American mob bosses' kids. The Punisher must save the children and side with his family's killer to stop the Yakuza.This is another movie I saw on cable, and I must say that I was a bit surprised. True, it's not the best comic book movie adaptation, but it is definitley far from the worse. What makes this movie work is that it stays true to The Punisher's origins and Dolph Lundgren is a total badass and can really act (to an extent, of course).While it is not without its flaws, it is definitley worth checking out. Again, I like it for what it is and isn't. Well, here's to next year's remake, which I hope does better than this did."
3,Not too bad!,"This is about Frank Castle ( Dolph Lundgren) who's family died in Car accident when he was a former cop, he is now a vigilantee named "" The Punisher"" who fights crime.It's not completely accurate to the comics cause it doesn't have the Skull on the shirt, the van full of weapons, the nerdy helper ""Micro"" and no drunk to help him, or did he ever lived in the sewers to speak to god nor was he a officer. But this was preety much action packed and was very decent in my opinion, it could have been better but the new one coming out next year might be even better,"
1,stallone would've made 1 great punisher,"dolph lundgren whom sly beat up in ROCKY IV was wrong wrong WRONG as THE PUNISHER. i thought i was seeing dolph doing elvis! he played the marvel hero very poorly. the clothing ain't right! no skull on the shirt like the comic book. and he lives in the sewers! in the comics, he had his own warehouse fill with arsenal large enough to fill new york city. oh yeah, this crap was filmed in australia but set in the big apple. very hyperviolent here and the kids in jeopardy scenario here hits an all time low. one kid holds a gun while others spew obscenities! yeah, stallone would have been the perfect PUNISHER."
4,Better than the Thom Jane version,Cheesy? Yes! bad 80's action? Yes! Filmed in Australia? Yes! Low budget as with all marvels early movies like Captain America and Generation X? Oh hell yes!But still this movie was much truer to the style of the punisher and much more enjoyable than the 2004 Version with Thom Jane. In Fact it was after seeing the 2004 version I just had to track this dvd down and buy it. Just to wash the bad taste out of my mouth.
