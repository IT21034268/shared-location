4,"history, magic, journalism you cant get elsewhere","i would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys travel narrative and is interested in magic and fortune tellers in asia. Although i can't agree with the author on all his opinions, as he seems to be against the modernization of Asia, i do agree that with the modernization there is a great loss of knowledge of nature. The author seems to have a love/hate thing going with china, doesn't seem to keen on thailand, and seems sad at the loss of how burma used to be. The book is well written and gives some great anecdotal history of asia, as well as illustrates, in part, the difference in the asian mindset when it comes to fortune tellers and magic."
2,Repetitive and runs out of steam,I bought this book because I fly quite a lot. The chance to abandon planes for a year intrigued me. However the story is not good and becomes repetitive as the book moves very slowly along. Meeting fortune tellers in every town and city.. I think I would rather have flown for the year instead of that..
1,How does he do it?,"He's as deep as a puddle, as sharp as a bowl, and a horrid little cypto- colonialist. And yet people have swallowed up this book. How does he do it? Is it the bad, I mean, TERRIBLE writing? The unbearable arrogance of a man who lives in a house featured by Architectural Digest telling us how awful modernization is? The bigotry of a Westerner insisting that Asians live in the 17th century? The preposterous affinity for communism and the total blindness to its devastation in Asia? Whatever it is, I didn't catch it, and I found this book tremendously frustrating. If he weren't such a terrible, terrible, absurdly bad writer, his arrogance, condecension, and shallowness might have been bearable."
2,Couldn't get past his machismo...,"The extra star is for the regional descriptions and sometimes interesting tales of his travels. I am a woman. I read this book and enjoyed some of the descriptions of the regions and anecdotes. But through it all comes a pungent arrogance stronger than roasted garlic.Many of his observations of the Asians he encounters are so completely ""superior"" as to seem he is speaking of animals, or a KKK member speaking of minorities in the deep south.Maybe after computers, the world will dispense with men like Mr. Terzani since we women will inseminate ourselves with genetically engineered sperm. That is all."
3,"Fascinating, good and easy reading but biased analysis","The novel is well written, easy to read, funny, interesting. But unfortunately Terzani's impartiality with his love for anything in the past, and his sour hate for modernity and progress distort a good picture on the countries and cultures visited. He does not (almost never) indicates or analyze the progess and modernity's benefits, only focusing on their social and cultural costs and destruction. Still I recommend it for anybody living in the countries depicted, but the reader (worst for a visitor or tourist) should not be biased."
5,Reporter turned Guru!,"The uniquie premise of ""A Fortune Teller Told Me,"" i.e. travelling through Asia for an entire year without flying is a wonderful device for intellectually turning back the clock, both intellectually and technologically. It allows Mr Terzani to blend a thoughtful and insightful travelog with a multination Dharma talk. He does both in an articulate and philosophic manner.His knowledge and experience with divese Asian cultures seems totally authentic as he wends his way across the continent and the waters surrounding it. Thouroghly enjoying both the story and the author, I give it my best recommendation by passing it on to a longtime friend, who like me, has a great love for Asia.....and I follow Mr Terzani on Facebook, albeit with the aid of Google Translator!"
3,Intersting read but sometimes inaccurate,"This is a facinating travel story which details those accounts that one may not encounter without traveling with locals. However, parts of the story make me wonder if this is all a true journey or is it mixed with fancy fabrication. Besides, as an Asian I found a few parts of the culture story-telling is not totally true to local customs. Perhaps the author didn't learn it correctly at the first place. However, those are the very tiny parts of the story which itself offers exiting readings."
4,A Wonderful Travelogue,"I was told by someone who knew I love to travel that I'd enjoy this book. And I did ... thoroughly. With his flowing writing style, I was entirely immersed in the stories Terzani recounts about his travels through Asia. At times serious and at times entertaining, he discusses his thoughts on astrology, politics, food, etc ... You really feel his Italian passion come through in his writing. I couldn't put this book down."
5,No need to toss,"Another great product by The First Years, I have purchased this item on more than 1 occasion. Great shower gift or for the mom on the go. The best part you don't need to toss them out, wash and reuse. They last and the children love the bright colors and variety."
5,Take & Toss,"I purchased the take and toss feeding variety pack with case for my five month old grandchild. They are great! They are take and toss - but - they are top shelf dishwasher safe as well!! The case is a plus to store all of the colorful, darling dishes and cups. Very nice product!"
4,only dark colors,"I was very exited when ordered this set. I got it today and I didn't use them yet. very good for the price. but set that I've got, consists of only dark colors (not as shown in the picture) boring colors, only blue and green, and violet. I wish if I get even one yellow or red but... :("
4,Was a pick for Baby Shower gift!,"This was practical and on a friend's Baby Registry, useful and used daily. Because I do not have children, I would of not known to pick this! Great gift."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought it before my kid was born... Now we opened it to use, and it turned out all the cups have been used!!! They do not look fresh, and seems that they have been washed by hand (and not very well). Only one set of cups and spoons were clean as new. I have thrown away all the others. I would give 0 stars if it was possible. Don't waste 10$, it's a gamble."
2,How safe is it?,After ordering this item I got an email stating that this item is subject to California's Proposition 65 Law which means that that it contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm if those products expose consumers to such chemicals above certain threshold levels.Given this why would anyone buy this product?
5,Safe non-leaching plastic,"I purchased this set for my son's day care lunchbox because I read that it is made of safe, non-leaching (PP) plastic, which gives me peace of mind. As a bonus, the items are durable in the dishwasher, seal tightly (no yogurt spills), and see-through so my son can see what I packed. Recommended!"
5,Definitely worth the price,"I love this set! Although the bowls and cups are made from a thin plastic, you get so many of them that it makes up for it. I love the bag it all came in, and the different sizes of bowls. For $10, this is an awesome deal!"
4,feeding set,Got this for my 18 month old and its still holding up great 6 months later. One lid did melt in the dishwasher but it fell down to the bottom some how during the wash. I always put these in the dishwasher and everything else is holding up great. Perfect set for little ones
5,Excellent Solid Feeding Pack,"The Take & Toss Feeding Variety Pack includes every utensil you'll need to start your baby on solids. The sippy cups were great for my breast fed baby to learn to drink from; the only con is that the cups don't have a lid but I just use the lids from the snack bowls when we are out. The spoons are excellent for feeding the baby, much better than theMunchkin Soft-Tip Infant Spoon - 6 Pack, Colors May Varythat I also have but don't use much other than giving to my son to hold during meals. Both the large and small bowls are great for serving cereal, purees and snacks. I fill up the larger bowls with Cheerios and toss it into the diaper bag without worrying about spills or snacks drying out. All of the items have held up great after numerous washes. The variety pack is definitely a great buy!"
4,As expected and half the price,"Good value, as it was fifty percent off retail and arrived on time. I was also able to get free shipping from this retailer. Awesome. The product was just as the ones in store. Good."
4,"Cups and containers great! Tableware, meh.","Don't use the spoons or forks that came with this set. However, the cups, lips and containers are great. As another reviewer said: it is pint-sized tupperware. Cleans easy but doesn't wear easy. We use these all day long day after day and the whole thing can fit in my diaper bag on a light day to go to Grandma's."
3,Repeated colors,Am very happy with the product except that all i got were just blues and greens in the kit.It says colors may vary so can't really complain.
4,handy,i still havent had to use all of them. they are so handy for when heading out or keeping snacks in my diaper bag.
2,"Not much here, I recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland instead.","There are some good hints here, but do not be mislead by the title. For a complete book on Disneyland and California Adventure, I highly recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003, Expert Advice From The Inside Source. Birnbaum's Disneyland is updated annually and published every year."
1,Misleading Ad,The ad gives the impression that the item is Yuasa brand. It is not. It is a cheap Chinese battery and has spade connectors that are a different size from the original. Seller was not helpful and I had to file a claim which Amazon agreed with and refunded my payment.
5,Fit perfect,"I put this on a 2000 ford f-150 with a 5.4L triton v8. Just wanna report it fit perfect, no complaints. It came with new studs for the exhaust pipe flange but no studs to hold it to the block. The old manifold and bolts where completly destroyed by rust which is why i was replacing it. I was able to find studs in stock at my local o'reilly though for 7 bills. no biggie just want ya to know what you are getting. It also came with a new manifold gasket.Also the big studs have a kind of oval shape ground into the ends for installing. There is a tool that is made for changing shocks o'reillys also carries that fits it perfect. I think its inexpensive and I had one on hand anyways. A pair of pliers would work fine as well though. Lastly I would recommend installing the manifold then puting the flange studs in may save you some fighting and time."
3,2002 Ford F150,"I did the vehicle confirmation with amazon and it told me ""this fits your vehicle"". The product was as shown and of good quality but slightly different than what is in our 2002 F150. The end that connects to the Y pipe pointed downwards slightly as opposed to the original which came straight out. And after fighting with the manifold to get in on the rods he had to grind a slot into the manifold flange to get it to fit next to the starter. It took alot of work! so just be careful because my husband said that it may have been because the truck's year make was 11-01, so even though the truck itself is a 2002 it maybe just have been because it still had some 2001 part in it."
3,"Good, not great","When I was in Spain in 2001, they had the equivalent of NOW Cds, with all the hits for that summer. This has several of the songs that I remember from that year, but its not always the same artists. Wish I would've gotten the actual CD while I was there. :-/"
5,"Yes, it's awsome.","If you're a Petrucci fan, which I am you can't do without this DVD. AS well as lots of Satriani and Vai footage, the G3 videos essentially showcase the talents of 3 exceptionally amazing guitarists, and with me being a long time Dream Theater fan I couldn't miss this one. John goes through a couple of tracks from his solo project which on all accounts does not fail to impress one bit.Do the needful. Buy this DVD."
3,changed my view,"Had originally blasted this for the lack of sound coming from satriani's guitar during the three man jam. Another review pointed out that it is panned hard left. I'm guessing that we had some bad cables that just cut out his guitar - everything else could be heard.Pattrucci - excellent playing - clear and concise, my favorite for songs picked for the dvd. Unfortunatley he is as exiting to watch as a cardboard cutout.Vai - wild with a wild band.Satriani - my favorite for total watching experience - puts on a good show without going over the top."
4,If you play guitar or you just love instrumental rock ... you must have it!,"The tradition of G3 concerts is taken to a new level incorporating John Petrucci. It is sad that only two songs from him were included in this DVD. Satriani and Vai, as always, deliver their creativity, impecable technique, and control of the instrument and effects. The jam session is interesting ... it seems that Satriani and Vai were not in complete synchrony with Petrucci. But, any way, three virtuosos together always have something interesting to offer. It is becoming a tradition of this kind of DVD's to stuff them with irrelevant and poor additional features."
2,G3: Live in Tokyo,"The video it self is great. If you like classic rock or guitar stuff, you must own the G3 videos. The G3 live with Eric Johnson is my personal favorite. But this copy, the video at the end is messed up. The color runs all together the last few minutes. Kind of like something out of the 60's."
2,expected more from G3,This DVD did not do anything for me but i still love all 3 players :-)It lacks excitment.
5,Get Ready For Ashley,"Ashley Gearing's voice is truly captivating on this record. Its hard to believe that a 12 year old girl could sing so well or have such a beautiful range. This single is only a first taste to a brilliant album, soon to be released in its entirety. For easy listening, pure enjoyment, and two songs you just cant stop singing, pick this one up! It wont disappoint!"
5,This Means So Much to Me!,"I know just how Ashley feels! My dad died by an accidental electricution when i was thirteen years old. Now, one and a half years later, I still ask my dad the question ""Can you hear me when I talk to you?"" Although my heart is beginning to heal, I still have (and always will have) those days that are just extremely hard. On those days, I listen to Ashley's song and it encourages me to know that someone else feel the same way I do."
5,Amazing song and a beautiful voice,"Everyone is talking about her amazing voice and they are right, but don't forget the power of the song. It is so beautiful and she does a great job. It makes me cry, but I can't hear it enough. This will touch anyone who has ever lost a loved one."
5,"Ashley, you rock,girl!","This CD single is really just brings one word to mind, AWSOME!!!!!I mean, this girl was between eleven and twelve yrs. old when she recorded this CD single! Can You Hear Me When I Talk to You? is a beutiful ballad, it tears your heart in two to hear a young girl pleas for her dead father to listen to her as Ashley does in this song. In I'm the Girl she proves that she is also great in faster songs as well as the ballad songs. I also know that her up-coming album will have quite mixture of songs, I canot wait to buy that album! Please buy this CD single, I am positive you WILL NOT regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Beautiful,"I am going to be married next month and my daddy won't be walking me down the aisle because he passed away last year.When I heard this song I knew that I was going to have it played at my wedding to honor my dad.This song will really help because I miss my dad so much.I am grateful to have my mom to walk me down the aisle.My mom is even going to dance with me at the reception to ""A Song For My Daughter"" (from amazon.com) We are going to have the male version of this song played so it will feel like my dad is dancing with us too."
3,Scant Information,"Admittedly, this is not meant to be a replacement for books such as Europe on a Shoestring, but i found it just a little lacking in information that would be useful for planning a trip. Perhaps a good source for complete beginners who know nothing about Europe, but if people wish to travel Europe, perhaps they would be better off with a more in depth guide"
4,Wanda Jackson - Tears will be the chaser for your wine,I enjoyed listening to this cd collection the first time I listened to it and am looking forward to many replays. I long wanted to own this music and now that I have it i am goin to do just that.
4,HORRIBLE BAND,"I bought this as a gift for my wife.. She loves it.The adjustable bracelet is a good feature.. putting the clasp on this thing might require some practiceI decided to change my review.. after about 4 months of use,pieces of the wire mesh that the band is made of started breaking.. This hurts the wrist and spoils clothes.. It is useless now.. but too late to return to Amazon :-(I would like to give this item a rating of 1 star."
5,"Powerful, atmospheric, full of mana","We have a lot of Nakai CDs and quite a few of IZ's and other Hawaiian artists' work. This album is as good as IZ's Facing Future and has instantly become one of my favorite top ten albums of all time. Nakai is amazing as always. But here Keola Beamer is not the warm, talented slack key Hawaiian master we know and love. In this release he is even better -- powerful, haunting vocals in Hawaiian, accented by understated minor key guitar arrangements. The songs stir your soul and feel like the raw power of primal, pre-Captain Cook Hawaii. If you've never strayed from the resorts that might sound weird, but if you've been deep in the rainforest or visited the top of Mauna Kea, you'll know the feeling. What IZ did for love with Facing Future, Beamer does for spirituality on this album, and both will give you goosebumps."
5,Our Beloved Land,"When I discovered this CD, I was so happy to find a collaboration of these two artists. It is a must for your collection if you enjoy either genre!"
2,Our Beloved Land CD,"I'm from Hawaii so am very familiar with Keola Beamer. Sorry, Brah - this is sortuv a snooze compared to previous work. It put me to sleep, but not in a mellow, laid back way."
5,Professional and Thought Provoking,"The Green is a movie about people, love, and prejudice with some suspense thrown in. Its quality is very professional, with believable acting and a thought provoking story. It is worth repeated viewing. I've seen many hokey films about gay romance that focused more on hot bodies in bed or overly dramatic coming outs, so it was refreshing to see the gay relationships in The Green portrayed with the dignity and no exaggeration. Well played!"
1,way way overrated,"It's hard to know where to start; how about the beginning? The portentous shots were, in hindsight, a tip-off to the film's unmet pretensions. Overdone and trite. The plot of the movie twists and turns in unbelievable, really ridiculous, ways. The acting is overwrought. The movie does not live up to the hype, to say the least. I don't like to write negative reviews, but thought in this case I might provide fair warning to customers out there."
4,The green,It's a very good movie. But there is some focusing issue that I noticed when watching. Other than that it's a good story.
1,Incomplete and mis-leading account.,As a veteran of the Persian Gulf Crisis assigned to the 1st Armored Division I was to say the least disappointed with a book that is more fiction and rumor than fact. The account of what went on in my helicopter on a Special Foces extraction mission amazed me in its inaccuracy and fill in the blank yellow jounalism since I was the pilot in command and was never interviewed by this supposedly accurate historian. I can only surmise that Mr. Carhart got around this by butchering the spelling of my name. I belive that the author used this technique in the whole book and it should be classified as fiction and sold with subscriptions to the National Enquirer. CW3 Robert A. Caprara
3,Not bad,"While I was looking for a story on ground combat during the Gulf War, I was a bit dissapointed to see much of the book spent on the preparations in Germany before the division shipped out. Not a bad book, but not what I was looking for."
3,Ok but nothing great.,"The title alone is a bit misleading. The 1st Armored division performed very well during Desert Storm. There is no doubt about that. The fact is there were alot of units who had a hand in defeating the Republican guard. The 1st Infantry div,2nd Armored div,3rd Armored div, and the 2nd ACR all played large roles during Desert Storm. You can also see that there was a little rah rah propaganda added in this book. History is written by the victors but come on. Yes, I was there. There have not been alot of good books written about Desert Storm. Not on the unit level. Road to Safwan is a really good one but that is a exception. That is a shame. Some of the largest tank battles in history took place there. One day I hope someone writes a really good book about this conflict."
4,Great,"Speaking as someone who served in the 1st Armored Division during the Gulf War, I want to say that it was well written, and broght back some good memories. Tells it like it was"
4,Great Music,"Like many americans i didn't know that Indian music can be so rhythmic, and catching, the sounds and beats will easily make you move your feet and hands. The beats are very hip hop inspired. i watched a movie a while back and some of the sounds were cool and decided to order a cd that captured that vibe . This has surpassed my expectations. If u like dancy rhythms with a hip hop inspired vibe get this."
3,Songs could be better..,Only few songs are good...others are just okay...I had better experience when I was in club..
3,Flute,This was a used flute purchased for a beginning player. We were satisfied with the price and condition of the instrument for a beginner. Gemeinhardt - the brand name was helpful in purchasing. I taught band for 12 years and felt the product was acceptable for a granddaughter.
3,Try Artley/Armstrong,"Gemeinhardt flutes, I have found, have a harsh tone to them and aren't as fluid to play as other brands. The keys always feel stiff."
4,beginner flute,"I received the flute quick and in good condition exept for some sticky goo on the inside of the body piece, about an inch wide. I took it off with q-tip and vascoline. The embouchure hole is the oval shape (unlike the Jupiters and Armstrong, which is a rounded-off square shape), and requires soft playing to get clear notes. If you like a better tone, and dont mind using more air power, I suggest the other models mentioned. For now Im happy with this model, since the notes are quicker having the small oval shape, and needing less effort and air. For my indoor hobby I find it suitable for soft and quiet playing. The keys are soft to the touch, not bouncy, and you get a black plastic cleaning rod with it."
4,Gemeinhardt 2SP,"The flute is pretty well. I've been using this flute for marching in my marching band. I gave it 4 stars only because the flute sometimes can't play certain notes such as the G and the Ab. But again, this flute has gone through rain and sunshine during marching band and is still working pretty well.i have had this flute for quite a long time and haven't brought it for repair once. (occassionally one of the springs or the screws came loose but my dad just poped it right back in with a screwdriver) I wouldn't reccommend this flute for advanced flute players as it is a begginner flute. The 3SB Gemeinhardt flute shall do good for advanced players or intermediate players."
2,Very poor product,"The cover of the CD leads one to believe that the music will be at least contemporary, if not ""hip."" It is neither. Boring music that makes the Teletubbies sound tough leads children through incredibly dull subtraction practice that is NOT BASED ON THE USE OF STRATEGIES, but is simply rote repetition. This CD is not engaging, nor is it very instructional. Children and adults alike will be incredibly bored.Don't waste your money. I am an elementary school teacher (3rd grade), and I use a LOT of music in my classroom. The students will not tolerate this CD; it is just too boring. Because it does not teach use of strategies, it is not useful to me as an instructional tool. Avoid this product. I am only giving it two stars (instead of the one star it actually deserves), because there are even worse products out there."
1,I don't get it,I just don't get this product. I don't see any impact from using it. I usually love these products. This was a waste. No value at all.
2,Aroma issues,"I purchased this item after considering the description and deciding it suited my requirements. It arrived safely, in good packaging. I used it twice, and will probably never use it again. It smells awful! I was so surprised at the aroma, and found it impossible to tolerate. I have used many and varied products over the years, but nothing that compares to this. Most cosmetic/skincare products have either a pleasant aroma, or none at all. This one was not in either category. It proved to be a very expensive trial of the product."
4,Any excellent photographic account,"Although of course I had heard of Bloody Sunday, I did not understand exactly what happened, I was too young at the time.This book contains some very touching accounts of those who were there and relatives of those who died. An excellent collection of photographs present a very sombering account.I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the subject."
2,Already worn out and old,"The item I received appears to have sat on a shelf for several years before being shipped to me. The rubber cover for the usb port broke off the first time I opened it, totally dry rotted. The battery it came with was also dead. It also refuses to find the polar wearlink I planned to use it with. I went through the connection steps and it just keeps blinking amber, meaning no device found. This device is built out of cheap plastic and the back clip feels like it will break soon as well. I am not at all impressed with the quality of the product I received and will not buy again from this company or Amazon seller. Fortunately it was on sale and I didn't waste too much money."
2,Software didn't work and no customer support,This product would not work on my computer most of the time. Every once in a while (about 1 of 20 tries) it would work. I called Oregon Scientific and they said they don't support the software. They gave me the name of another company but they didn't even have a phone number for them. I tried it on my work computer and it worked.I had this same problem with a data logging blood pressure monitor but have not had issues with any other USB devices on my computer. Everything else works well plug and play.If you know how to make sure you are very computer savvy or you might be wasting your money. I even bought a new USB hub and that didn't work either.
3,"Off again, on again","Maddening. It's great when it works. It's just an inconsistent, off again on again, little device.Not compatible with Timex bands. Seems to work OK with Polar.Behaves unpredictably sometimes and has broad blanket warnings about not working near bike computers, power lines, cell phones, etcetera, which leaves me wondering what on earth is causing it to act weird when it does.Prepare to be exasperated. Prepare to buy your own batteries. If you can accept its inconsistencies, you may still find it to be of some use."
3,Came with dead battery,"I got it to compliment my Oregon Scientific HRM.Works good after replacing the battery.pros: exports comma separated values data; light and simple; inexpensivecons: very limited PC interface; weak clip - you'd better tuck your t-shirt in if you clip this logger on your HRM belt, or keep it in your pocketGave it 3* for the battery, otherwise very happy to have it."
1,I has not work four our Polar FT60,"This might be a very useful little device for some people, but my husband has a Polar FT 60 heart rate monitor and he cannot make them work together. We have replaced the batteries so that should not be a problem. The Logger does not capture the signal from his HRM so it won't record the data."
5,"Nice Item, Buyer beware with this company!","The heart rate logger is really a nice item. The company selling it is one you should avoid. Two sales and nothing nice to report. Stick to sellers like amazon, you are bound to be treated like a respected customer as opposed to how the micro-companies look past you and treat you like yesterdays trash if you have questions...Just my two cents.. Good luck!"
5,Wonderful - Awesome at any price - Nothing else does it!,"I just received this heart rate logger. It worked perfectly right out of the package. You can set the data logging interval from 1 sec. to 60 sec. The best feature is that the data can be output as a text file or an excel file with a heart rate in beats per minute for every data logging point. This solves the problem of being able to use your own data for whatever you want. So you don't need to go to the endless forums on how to get the data out of a $300 Polar heart rate wristwatch. At $20 plus postage this is a real steal! I'm so glad to have found this.If you are seriously interested in stress reduction by measuring heart rate variability or in monitoring your exercise program, this is for you.Thanks, Oregon Scientific for a great product."
1,One star by default...,"This Oregon Scientific Heart Rate Logger doesn't work for me as it is advertised to do. Ostensibly, it will read the heart rate as transmitted from a Polar heart rate monitor. It doesn't. I tried with my own Polar chest strap, and a Cateye as well. Then I tried 5 other Polar chest straps, and a Garmin just to be sure. This item didn't read any of them. Perhaps I got a bad one, and perhaps if I exchanged this one, I would be satisfied. However, several emails over the course of 2 weeks to Heart Rate Monitors USA have gone unanswered. Buyer beware. The product is suspect, and the customer service is...well, non-existent"
5,"NO issues, works great","Works great, you can download the data to your PC and see how you slept, no a report of every beat, a report of beats per min ."
5,WM100,Works well with the Oregon Scientific Heart Rate Monitor. Battery was bad in unit when it arrived but a simple change of battery and the unit worked great. Be patient with the instructions as they are very poor but if you use the manual on the disk it is easy to set up and use. Very well designed.
1,Don't buy!!,"Oregon does not make a belt or a watch combo that will work with this device, I contacted Oregon direct and they said they didn't have a compatible watch and they do not make just the belt that hooks up to this device, I am still wondering why they would make this data logger if it can't be used......Maybe they have a BIG Expensive package that might work with it, I am not sure but the watches they listed on the site I bought this from and the watches listed in the package are not compatible from what Oregon Scientific told me in a E-mail they sent me.Don't waste your money because it is not worth having to send it back to get a refund!I will never buy another Oregon Scientific item again and will not buy from this seller again."
1,A True Zero Item,"This item was recommended by Amazon as being purchased by others. I use a Bowflex watch along with a chest strap for cardiac monitoring. The Bowflex works properly with the equipment at the Gym and provides an accurate heart rate readout.The Oregon Scientific SmartSync Heart Rate Logger does not pick up any signal from the chest transmitter no matter how close I place it to the strap. The logging software which comes with the unit looks good but as the Logger does not function it only takes up room on the computer.I would not recommend this item for anyone, that is unless you just have money to spare and if you do you can send some to me.The rateing system provided will not let you award anything less than one star, if it did I would give it zero."
3,Doesn't work exactly as it says,"Bought this product because it is suppose to work with other heart monitors. The software was easy to install. However, when we tried to used several other monitor brands(Nike, Polar, etc), none worked. Couldn't get the product to read any of the data. Just purchased the heart rate monitor by Oregon Scientific to see if that will work."
3,Arrived with a dead battery,I will give this three stars even though it came with a dead battery and only will link for about 5 minutes before losing sync with the belt as I believe the problem is the belt as I ordered this with the Sportline 1075 Unisex M.E.T.A Heart Rate Monitor + MP3 Player which supplied the chest belt. Since that product is a total waste of money I suspect that the loss of sync is the fault of the transmitter in the belt and not the receiver in this unit. When it is in sync it appears to record the correct heart rate and the software that came with it is very nice as well.
1,Does not work with Pyle Sports PPDM1,"I was unable to fully test this product, because it did not work with my Pyle Sports PPDM1 Watch at all. The Oregon Data Logger did not pick up the signal from the strap which came with my watch. If they made a products which does, or if someone knows how I can get it working, I would remove this negative review."
2,Allright Product,I bought this product for the cracker containers. I was very dissapointed that the containers were so short. I buy Water Crackers and they go stale in my pantry since I live by the beach. If I break the package in half and put them in these small containers I'm afraid they'll go bad faster. I have way too much humidity and heat at home. Plastic of containers is good and the lids close tight. The product just didn't work for me. I'll use the little round cracker containers to bring crackers to work.
4,A Harmony of the Gospels,We like the book very much. I would appreciate not getting these bothersome notes in the future. If I have a problem I will be sure to let you know. Thanks!
5,great help and great price,We are taking an online bible class and this book is being used for the class. It's very helpful in our study.
4,Review,A great recommendation for the study class on the Harmony of the Gospels from COGWA.org. Church of God worldwide assn.
1,YUK!!!,"Revised Version not King James Version.Missing verses makes it incomplete.""Horizontal Harmony of the Four Gospels in Parallel Columns"" is cheaper, and much better."
3,dismal printing quality,"As good as the information in this book is, I suggest that you try for another printing. The print quality is dismal. It looks like a multiple generation copy. The result is that some of Robertson's comments, which are in very small type (12 lines per inch) is blurred and hard to read. Also, the alternate Scripture readings are in this same small, blurred type."
1,"boring, boring, and boring","This was one of the most boring collection of stories I have ever read. I have liked most of Jude Deveraux's earlier books and thought this might be a good read. It was a good snooze. None of the stories caught my attention. I kept plugging away, hoping something would catch my attention, but no. I couldn't get interested in any of the characters, the plots were lifeless, and any romance seemed pretty much nonexistent.Maybe I read this on a bad day, but I doubt it. I think it was just a collection of stories from authors who wrote them on bad days. No zing, no pop, no life."
2,A bit insipid,"I didn't finish the stories in this book. The stories were a bit cliche with the usual ""I-hate-you-but-want-you-to-take-me-now"" type romance with inexperienced virgins and big bad men. A bit silly and unbelievable with not much depth. Maybe the later stories in the book are a bit better."
3,Nothing to Rave About,"I'm sorry to say I was a bit disappointed after reading this. Every story is hum-drum, same-old same-old. Still wanna read it? Make a trip to the library. Don't waste your money."
1,A mess,"I have to say that in this book Mr Ehre ruins what is a timeless bit of art by getting all fancy-pants about it. ""Examining how contemporary oppression manifests in art, capitalism, censorship, and education"" - indeed. It's a picture for crying out loud, and a pretty damn good one at that. My advice is to do what I do, and just enjoy this fabulous picture, which has given Barry my 12 year old spaniel and me many an hour of pleasure."
3,DDR SDRAM for Thinkpad T40 series,"This is originally from IBM/Lenovo and the price in Amazon is even less than Lenovo site. It works very good and no problem so far. Ebay sells for same price, but used ones."
4,good book for students,This book is useful for helping you to organize a research paper in the right way so you won't spend a lot of time rewriting the drafts your professors reject. I found it easy to read and a practical step by step guide to major paper writing in scientific style. The book arrived in good condition.
1,Rod arrived BENT...Target won't accept return in store...,"Even though this rod comes from the Target store, Target doesn't honor a refund with the amazon.com receipt. Paying to return ship was out of the question for me. The rod arrived fully BENT in an OBVIOUS arc. Very upsetting for me. Finally, I returned it to Target a day later saying I lost my receipt and they gave me CASH for me to pick out another right there in the store. Got around the red tape that time."
3,How to go broke in 12 chapters,"Michelle and her friends have to run a business for school. They decide to go into selling lunches. But everything goes WRONG WRONG WRONG. Their business is doing really bad, and the friends start fighting. Can their friendship win? And can their teamwork recover their lunchshop?"
5,A Great Book,"When I heard that this book was published I had to go out and buy it because I heard it was going to be a Mystery/Thriller book and that's what I love to read.This book was very excellent and a real page turner. I found it hard to put down because I wanted to keep on reading to see what would happen. It was so good that i read it in 2 days, 1 and a half to be exact. My favorite characters were of couse Andrea and Lucien. What I found very interesting was his name. I have a friend and her husband's cousin's name is Lucien, however, this Lucien is a female. So I found that interesting how in this book Lucien was a male name.I would definitely reccomend this Thriller to anyone who loves to read a good mystery. It will not disappoint you. I am not just saying that because I personally know the other who is a great woman to know."
4,Excellent choice for parents who want to help their children,This is a wonderful resource for parents who want to help their kids get an early start on the basic fundamentals. It encourages children to learn through play so they can master these skills without pressure. The book emphasizes the importance of showing love to our children to help them grow mentally. All the assignments can be done with very little money involved for the whole curriculum; most are materials already found in the home. The activities are simple enough for young preschoolers and are fun for both parents and children.
4,highly recomended,"This book is GREAT, it is easy to read and easy to follow activities and instructions. It helps you teach even very young children through play. All the supplies are in your house or very cheap. I would definitely recommend it"
3,Fair at best.,"Got this for my son for Christmas, because he wanted the Jango Fett figure. The figures definitely look cool, but their weapons don't really stay in their hands, and Jango's head constantly falls off (apparently he was designed to be easily decapitated, but this is a bit much). Also, the figures don't really balance well to stand on their own, so my son can't even display them on his bookshelf."
3,Does not fit Toyota Tacomas,It is beautiful! However the bracket isn't long enough to fit the hitch on a Toyota Tacoma. It needs to come with a longer bracket. I used galvanized wire to loop it through the opening enough times to make a snug fit. I receive a lot of compliments on it. I hope no one rips it off while I am at a Dodger game.
5,Most fun paintbrush marker ever!,"10 STARS!!! Rich flowing color from the paintbrush end -- firm point at the other. Gorgeous colors, fun to work with, my favorite marker for the past 14 years!"
2,Allright product.,"Once again,I don't want to sound negative and I'm always very pleased with what I buy from Amazon. It's not the sellers,or shipping, it's just this product. Plastic was kind of weak and the lids didn't close all that tight. I had to use a rubber band to keep on of the little boxes closed all the way. I need to put everythinig in plastic containers in my pantry,since I live at the beach and I only go home on the weekends since I work in the city. I need something sturdier and more expensive to keep my things fresh. I guess for everyday people this product might work, but for me it didn't. I didn't like the quality. I loved the big box though. Perfect for cakes and big things! There's all kinds of uses for it."
3,Great stories and nice pictures,"Here I am. It's Dec 23. I'm trying to make some pastries for Christmas eve dinner. I just found out the hard way that the recipe for ""Pasta Frolla"", is garbage. 'Garbage' is not the word I would normally choose given my level of anger and frustration, but I'd like the review to stand so others know not to follow in my footsteps. If Hurricaneman can make it following her recipe, I bow to his superior skillz.Her recipe calls for 5 cups flour to 1 cup butter. All the recipes I find in a brief online search have a ratio much closer to 3:1. I didn't even finish adding all the flour before my ""soft dough"" was a bowl of fine powder.Being full blooded Sicilian myself, I have a feeling that these bakers who she ""sweet talked"" gave her bogus recipes just to get this woman out of her hair. I know that's what I'd do and I know plenty of Sicilians who would resort to similar tactics to protect their trade secrets. :-)"
5,great drum!!!,Fantastic warm tones of maple. It just squeals out hard from every stroke you give at a head. The best snare drum I ever played!
4,The Price of Blood by Chuck Logan,"A very enjoyable, entertaining read. There are only a couple of spots where it's necessary to suspend disbelief. It sets the background for his series character Phil Broker."
4,A Great Read..The book won't let you down!,"An excellent book by Ian Stafford where he decides to race head to head with Michael Schumacher after his wife mistakenly asks him ""Who do you think you are...Michael Schumacher?""Every page is filled with humor and wit and you wait for the moment when Ian will actually meet Schumacher and defeat him.The one downside of the book is that it ends in a sort of anti-climax and wants you leaving for more.An excellent book and a worthy read. Highly recommended!"
4,intech LIMBO golfballs,"Purchase of golfballs @ Amazon.comI guess I would have liked to have read a few more reviews of this ball, however I am very pleased with the quality, feel & performance. I was looking for a soft feel in putting with distance off the tee. This ball worked well within my expectations. I would recomend them especially for the price range."
4,Just as good as the higher priced ball,I've been playing Limbo for several months. My handicap has gone from 18 to 15 and is still falling
4,Good value ball,I needed a low compression ball because I no longer can swing as I once did.They have performed as well as I hoped.
1,poor item,"I bought these balls because of the price. Big mistake unless you like to loose about 30 yards on your drive and you love a very soft ball.I'm 61 years old not a long ball hitter, These balls made my drives fairly straight but I could have hit a 5 iron with another ball and got the same distance."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I was looking for a product that would protect flour and other goods from moths. These containers are not air tight (packaging states that goods actually stay fresher *with* some air circulation??) so I'm not sure that they will do what I thought they would -- keep the darn moths out! Also, a five pound bag of flour does NOT fit in the ""flour"" container. The lid to the baking soda box is so stiff, I could only get it half way on before I got frustrated and stopped trying. The butter storage piece does not hold a standard cube -- at least not the standard cubes that are available in my area (Northern CA). This piece holds a much narrower and longer cube. The do fit nicely in the cubbard, and it is nice to be able to see through them. I wouldn't buy them again though."
2,Not air tight,These containers are a great size and hold exactly what they say they will and save cabinet space. Unfortunatly my sugar clumped up because of moisture and bugs got into my flour.. I'd suggest Snapware instead...
3,Stay Fresh,"The hinges are very weak. One of mine broke on one container on the first use. In order to receive a new one I had to return all of the containers, so I decided just to keep. They still lock in when closed. They are definitely nice to have, just wish they were of better quality."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON,"Consider yourself warned: DO NOT buy this set from Amazon! I ordered it on 5-28-2006 and Amazon has since then emailed me EVERY 10-20 days to inform me that there has been a delay in the product's arrival. In order to keep the order active, you have to go to the Amazon site and approve the delay. This is what I've been doing for 5 months now! I've emailed Amazon twice about it, and they credited me $5 and STILL DON'T HAVE the product in stock that they are supposedly selling to people. Save yourself the headache; Amazon doesn't actually have this product. Buy elsewhere. (Submitted 10-25-2006)"
4,Good concept,"The concept of soldiers hidden within DS9 coming to life and emobodying an age old rage is original and makes the book stronger than most of the series lot.What I did appreciate about this book is Diane Carey's work, she is one of the better Star Trek writers because her books tend to be more thoughtful and drawn on.I recommend this book for the on target characterization it has as well as the strong writing. Sisko really comes to life on these pages."
1,Diane Carey has lost her touch!,This book is terrible. I am not going to finish it. The author used to write some good stuff for the Star Trek series but this one is way too repetitive. Almost like she wanted to crank out a book and forgot that she had already written the same lines. Pass on this one!
3,"Not a bad story, not too badly written.","As any regular reader of my reviews knows, I've never been a fan of Diane Carey's writing, and while this book doesn't change my overall opinion of her writing (as her entry in the ""Day of Honor"" series almost did) it also doesn't do too much to reinforce it. She still has a bit of a tendancy to use words in ways that she obviously defines as ""creative"" and that I can only call ""weird and distracting"", but it isn't nearly as pronounced in this book as it is in, say, ""Descent"" or ""The Search"". Further, since this is an original story, rather than an adaptation of a TV episode as both of the aforementioned books were, it plays to her strengths, which are plotting and characterization, pacing, and virtually every aspect of writing that does NOT involve word choice, and if her plot was somewhat implausible in places, still, it was interesting and moved well."
3,It's super cool,"This book was really, really good. I didn't understand a lot of it, but that's probably just me. Usually when I can't understand something that means it's really good. Like Joyce. This is one of the best children's poetry books to come out for a long time. It's almost as good Silverstein, but it's no Giving Tree. When I read it to my children, they laughed and laughed. I hope Evans writes a book for adults some time soon. I'll buy it right away. My only complaint about this book is that it doesn't rhyme."
1,"A sad, small waste","I had great hopes for this book, despite the fact that many I know involved in new poetry dismissed it as aggressively unintelligible. The poems here strain to be lyrical and snappy and hip, but come off as simple scribbling. You get the feeling as you read them that most were dashed off in a bar on a napkin while drunk. I have serious doubts as to whether this writer is aware of the word revision. Here is another train wreck caused by Ginsberg's first thought best thought philosphy of paper waste. Sadly, the few poems that creep up toward mediocrity are nothing more than re-worded versions of Greg Fuchs infamously poor nonsense litanies. If Mr. Evans must steal ideas, he should choose better poets to rob."
2,Battery does not keep the charge like the original,"I received the product in a timely fashion. I charged the new battery overnight, and then started using my cell phone. I do not use my cell phone very often, maybe 10 minutes a day. To my amazement, the battery had discharged by the 2nd day, and I had to recharge it again regadless of the fact that I had only talked for less than 30 minutes.The original battery that came with my cell phone kept the charge for almost one week (with about average 10 minutes usage per day); however this one is barely 50% as efficient as the original one."
1,Beware of Counterfeit Shampoo,"I believe this shampoo is counterfeit. The first bottle I purchased was from my stylist. He no longer carries the Pureology line so I ordered from Amazon.I recently opened and used the shampoo I got from Amazon- it smells different, the texture is different and the amount required to have lather is very different. The bottle I purchased from my stylist lasted a year because a 'pea-size' amount was all that was required. This shampoo requires a dollop the size of a quarter and the lather still doesn't feel like Pureology-- and the scent is awful.I don't know who the supplier is for Amazon Pureology line but I think they should verify that they are buying the real deal. I guess there is always the possibility that Pureology sold out and no longer makes a decent product-- maybe that explains why my stylist doesn't carry it anymore. Either way, this shampoo stinks! Literally."
1,Smell way too strong!,"I have been using Pureology products for several years now, and have always been really happy. I decided to try this PureVolume one to better protect my color and add a bit of volume.I've only used it once, and I just can't bring myself to use it again. In fact, I'm just about to hop in the shower and rinse my hair again. The smell is so strong- it smells the way my hair smells right after getting color- very chemical. I know its meant to be aromatherapy but its anything but...In addition, it is making my scalp burn.If you are at all sensitive to smells- skip this product!"
2,Thin Chain will break,"The necklace and pendant are stored in a little velvet bag, that causes the thin chain to tangle during shipment. If you try to untangle the thin necklace, it will break. Pendant is pretty, but considering the poor storage device it is shipped in, the price for this item is too high b/c of the risk of the product arriving broken and tangled."
3,Tiny item and horrible chain.,"I admit that the dimensions are listed clearly on the website and that I should have been more careful in ordering an item online but the chain that it came with was just ""cheap"". It felt like it would break if there was any preasure on it. Needless to say, I was not satisfied with the quality of the item. Although, the pendant itself was not too bad (although tiny), the chain that it comes with is terrible."
3,"14k White Gold ""Key-to-My-Heart"" Diamond Pendant (.12 cttw, G-H Color, I1 Clarity",My husband bought me this pendant for my birthday and it is beautiful. AIt is smaller than we thought and the loop to go onto the necklace is too small to fit onto another necklace so we will have to get it altered. Still very happy with it though. Michelle
4,Key-to-my-Heart Diamond Pendant,"My girlfriend loves this, she never takes it off. It looks great to be sure. It is smaller then you might think, maybe a little less then an inch. In my opinion, anything larger would have been big though. Also, the chain that comes with it is extremely thin, easy to tangle, and likely fragile. It is more likely then not to get tangled in shipping. An aftermarket chain (not usually expensive) is a good solution."
5,gorgeous,I think this is a rather unique piece.The price also seemed reasonable as well for this pendant.My wife says the necklace is way too thin and flimsy...it 'would probaly break with a hair flip'...this will be replaced. However the pendant itself is wonderful and she loves it.
4,Interesting look at a very foreign country,"I suppose the information in this book would shock me much more if I were a really hard core Christian, so the parts about ""worship"" of Kim il-Sung don't really offend me. The description of the labor camps and everyday life in North Korea is the most shocking part of the whole book. It sounds just like Stalin's Soviet Union, and maybe worse. The persecution of Christians in North Korea represents just a small part of what's going on there...I wonder if its the same for all people who are ""different"" that live in that country. Unfortuanatly, its hard to tell if ALL the information is true, as is the case with any sort of book on a rogue nation. Hardly any of us have visited these countries, and even those who have have been limited in what they see. Luckily, they do provide a good deal of information from defectors and other people who have left North Korea. Pretty frightening material..."
4,The other half of season 4,"Since they decided to release SpongeBob season 4 in two volumes, this one will contain all the remaining episodes that weren't featured on volume one. The episodes to be featured on this dvd will most likely be:1. Chimps Ahoy2. Whale Of A Birthday3. Karate Island4. All That Glitter5. New Leaf6. Once Bitten7. Bummer Vacation8. Wigstuck9. Squidtastic Voyage10. That's No Lady11. Best Day Ever12. The Gift Of Gum13. Rules Of Dumb14. Driven To Tears15. Burn To Be Wild16. Squidwood17. Best Frienenemies18. The Pink Purloiner19. Uncle Sherm's Visit20 DJ Patrick"
3,Not as good and creative as first three seasons,"The epsiodes are much more childish, not as funny as the first three seasons, and many obvious opportunities for funny jokes were bypassed. If you're on a budget deciding which volume of SB season 4 box sets to buy, go with volume 1 it's got better (and more) special features and episodes than this one"
3,Not the best season,"We are HUGE Spongebob fans, but have to say, this is not the best season. The writing is ""off"" and the subtlety is missing in a lot of these episodes. Seems like they changed Spongebob into more of a typical ""cartoon"" character--and his new high pitched voice with no modulation and depth of tone (as in the first two seasons) is just plain grating on the nerves.I only bought vol. 2, since these are the least annoying episodes. The ones in vol. 1 are unbearable, so I didn't bother."
5,spongebob doesn't disappoint,my daughter is a huge fan of spongebob and the dvd is definitely entertaining and funny.
1,horrible!!! tried to return,"Ill admit it was delivered fast but that was pretty much the only good thing about it.It said it was used and very good but when i received it, I would say it wasn't even near ""very good"". The package was in okay condition but the dvds were both a little scratched and one was badly smudged. I called the company for help in returning this product and the lady was very nice and apologized and gave me a refund. Unfortunately, this was a gift for someone so I have to order another one."
4,video 10,This video is pretty good they have some good car dancing and a real nice bikini contest. This video kind of leaves you wanting more so get the next one too.
2,Go with the Floppy!,When you have a little one you learn the importance of doing things with one hand. This seat is rather complicated and you need two hands to put it on. I'm sure once you use it a while you get the hang of it. I bought it and never used it because I could tell how hard it would be to use. I just bought a Floppy seat cover and LOVE it! You can put it on with one hand while you're holding your baby. Ease of use makes all the difference in the world.
3,Helpful and compact,"Begins with 50 pages on ""Setting the Scene"" discussing history, flora, fauna, Greece today, art and architecture and Greek mythology. Another 40 pages on ""Meeting the People"" discuss daily life, social etiquette, religion, music, language and other topics. Twenty more pages on travel practicalities precede coverage of the mainland (Athens, Attica, Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia and Trace) as well as close in islands (The Ionian Islands).Each section has quick info on the essential things not to miss as well as important pointers to remember.The travel information is knowledgeable and aimed at the serious traveler. Goodly number of photos and maps. The pocket size, and thin paper make this something you could consider taking with you on your trip.It uses the Michelin system of rating sights with one, two or three stars and provides cross references to the Michelin maps especially to number 980."
5,Essential Reading for Inca Trail Walkers,"Again the Ruc Sack reader team comes up with another quality guide to a magnificent area of the world. For anyone planning to visit the Inca Trails then this guide should be your first purchase. It contains all you need to know about preparing for the trail, getting there, any equipment needed, recommended tour operators, detailed maps, useful websites plus day-by-day information on the 3 main routes (short, medium and long). In short, an essential guide to read when looking for information on the Inca Trails."
1,It's not in stock--so nothing to rate,I've been waiting for this to come in for weeks. I just received an e-mail today that they don't have it to sell...why is this page still here?
3,Excellent Book and would recomend to anyone,Jim has wrote and intriguing novel about his life with a deceitful wife and the fight for his life.His book talks about Satanism in Ireland. The deaths and disappearances of people in Ireland. Jim also goes in to details of his research about Satanism in his country. How the higher powers that be are involved. There is information about the Illuminati and their influences in Ireland.Jim's book is full of facts that is a must read for others wanting and needing to understand some of these things in that country.I would recommend this book for people to read.
4,Some help for the afflicted,"Like 5% of the male population, I have red-green color deficiency. I build a lot of web pages, and trying to find a pleasing color scheme that also matches the mood I'm after is a maddening process of asking my wife, ""How does this look?"" and having her reply, ""That's purple; it doesn't go"" over and over.This book got me past all that. It is simply a collection of color combinations that work, grouped into categories like ""Active"", ""Quiet"", ""Natural"", etc., with sub-categories like ""Art Deco"" and ""Earth and Sky"". Besides the color swatches and samples, each color comes with its RGB components, so duplicating them on a web page becomes a snap.I wish the book were larger physically, so as to allow for bigger swatches, but that's a minor complaint. For anyone who has trouble with color, this book is a godsend."
2,didn't work,"When I received this watch, it didn't work. I sent it to the technician for repairing . Technician had has clean the components and then, it worked. I had to pay for this inconvenient. Is necessary a better quality control before sending"
3,Nilanjan,I got this watch for my relative..But its not very extra ordinary...Its good but look wise normal nothing dashing...!!
2,Nice but heavy,"This watch is beautiful and nice, but it`s too heavy for a lady's watch. I havent worn mine in ages because everytime I do, I take it off in less than 15 minutes."
3,"OK, but could have a lot more info","These guys do know what they are talking about, but they just did not talk enough about the PIX and configuring it. What happend to PDM? This is a great tool, thats been out since v6.0, but only a one line reference to it.I am reading the Cisco Router Field Manual, and that thing is great. Basically it goes step by step on each command required (or optional) to configure a device, or setting.This PIX book had potential, but it just needed more detail, and to be a lot longer. I would recommend the cisco online docs. They are great, and actualy go into more detail that the book."
3,Somewhat limited,"As you can expect from an ""Official"" book, this one is somewhat limited. It does provide a good intro to most of the commands and how to configure a pix for secure use. It is quick and concise. If that is what you need, then this will work.However, some of the info is outdated and it does not cover the different versions/abilities of the PIX FOS. For example, it covers conduits but has no discussion of access-lists. Since Cisco is discontinuing conduit commands, this dates the book.However, it is a decent referrence for most commands, and I guess it contains the info it does due to it being a cuorse book for the CQS-I Exam it is ok.But if you really want an in depth coverage of PIX and the FOS then I recommend ""Cisco PIX Firewalls"" by Deal."
3,"Good for basic understanding of the PIX, but................","I used this book as a final prep tool for the CSPFA exam and saw quite a few topics on the exam that were barely mentioned in the book. Fortunately, I have enough experience with the PIX that I was able to answer them correctly. I would not use this book as my sole prep tool for the exam. For instance, the ""outbound"" command is mentioned once in the book, but did not even explain it fully. I did have the ""outbound"" command come up on the exam. Also, the book does not cover ACLs at all. It does a good job of covering conduits (which are being replaced by ACLs now). The book she be more up to date on the use of ACLs."
3,Fair,"This book must have been written before access-lists were implemented into PIX OS because it does not cover that. It covers conduits, which Cisco has replaced with access-lists. Also, the book contains a lot of command syntax and it's my impression that I could have got the same information by going through the PIX documentation on Cisco's site. This may have been a good book a while ago but I don't really recommend it at this point because it's outdated. I also find myself refering to it sometimes and always go back to online documentation to find what I need."
3,Slender book tries to teach all about PIX,"David Chapman and Andy Fox's `Cisco Secure PIX Firewalls' book covers PIX IOS through 6.0. The book is of value if one is working on a PIX IOS that still utilizes `conduit' commands rather than access-control lists. The book is slender and mostly displays configurations that can be found on the Cisco website. What I did like was `The Six Basic Commands for Cisco Pix Firewall Configuation' on page 56. Over the next several pages, the authors pound into your head the value of these 6 commands (nameif, interface, ip address, NAT, global and route).I give this book 3 pings out of 5:!!..!"
1,Only good for lighting fires with...,"This book gave me an insight into the Cisco PIX firewall range. And on reading the book - I made the awful assumption that I was up to the task of configuring the equipment in a live customer environment.The scenarios that the book covers are let me say - nothing to what you encounter in the real world, keeping this thought, the configuration required for a good pix firewall to do it's job in a practical environment, is not even close to what it talked about in this book.Get the book if you want to know roughly what a pix does - anything more than that, get the equipment in a lab, preferably with some time."
2,Limited and outdated,"I just finished reading this book and I must say I was pretty disappointed with it. This might have been a decent book back when it was first relesaed, but at this point it is in desparate need of an update. I also read the Khan book from Syngress and it is much better. It is WAY more up to date for the exam and product line."
3,Dont use it as the sole study guide for the 9E0-111 Pix test,"I came close to passing the 9E0-111 test today with just this book and some hands-on with a Pix 501 but alas; no cigar-o. The test is pretty tough and has changed a lot and although this book is fairly good, I would get a newer book for the studying for exam 9E0-111. It is now well outdated. Also, there are lots of mistakes with no errata for it on Cisco Press' web site. By now, after a year and a half (practically) you think that there would be. The new Cisco Press CSPFA course book is due out April 10, 2003 (a few weeks away) and I will wait and see how that one is by browsing it for free at the local Barnes & Noble before I order it for myself."
4,"I passed the test, but it needs updating.","Of the content that's there, I found the chapters well organized, well written and easy to follow.I really appreciated the comprehensive index.I was waffling though on whether or not to give 4 stars because there doesn't seem to be any 6.x material included except what's in the Appendices.If the authors update this book to include access-lists, PIX Device manager and a beginners guide to IPSEC, it would easily earn 5 stars."
3,Adequate but not complete,"Although it is a good book as far as it's content is concerned it misses some essential stuff for someone who wants to be seriously involved with PIX firewalls. These is no information about access lists which are the future in PIX (according to CISCO), there is no background information offered about IPSEC and both configuration and background information for Certificate Authorities is missing. Also according to it's publication date it could mention PIX501."
2,Derrida Not Dead Another Death,"Derrida, who passed away on Oct 10 2004. His last thoughts were to his dearly departed friend, Giles de Leuze. Most of you know that the Oxford philosophical committee wanted to reject him for an honorary award, because they considered his ""work"" ""useless"". It is precisely because of Derrida that one was able to question and in this subtle work he traces the steps of ""Igmar"", who was a religious fanatic who existed in 700 AD with a large following in Persia. Devotees were said to wrap used loin clothes around their head and weep to an ancient statue which was later discovered to be a sign post."
5,Nostalgia,"This is a must have for any true Wonder Years fan. Being the huge fan of the wonder years that i am, finding out something like this existed was a huge shock to me, and i had to have it."
4,"Good, slightly twee sometimes, and...","The script of the series is good and the actors did a great job. However, I just ""wonder"" what happened to Fred Savage during the years spent on the making of the series. Did he grow up normally, as we were watching him, in this sort of Truman's show? Of course, we did not watch his real life but we did watched him all the same. It would be a relief to know if he does not hate this series now."
4,LIKE A MAN David Chacko,"A very interesting story about the Czechoslavakia resistance in WW 2. Thisstory concerns the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, second in command to the Nazi regime. Although this is fiction it is based on historical facts. The Czech underground was trained in England, dropped by parachute into Nazi-occupied territory and completed their mission at the expense of many thousands of lives. The Nazi annihlation of the town of Lidice became a rallying cry for the Allied troups. Many bombs dropped on Germany had ""LIDICE"" written on them. I highly recommend this book."
1,Not A Fan,I ordered three of this author's books and have to say I am not a fan. I found the writing flat and uninteresting. The story idea is better than the actual story. I would not recommend these books.
4,Who can't like this?,"Perhaps a bit dated, but still, it is the Super Friends! My nephews have enjoyed watching my 70s childhood play before their eyes."
4,Takes Me Back To A Simpler Time,"I Was 10 Yrs Old When The Original Super Friends Cartoon Made Its Debut On ABC's Saturday Morning Lineup,In 1973, And I Instantly Fell In Love With It! So When It Finally Became Available On DVD, I Snatched It Up Immediately, Not For My Kids, This Would Be Way To Slow For Them, But For Me. It Just Brings Me Back To A Simpler Time & Era When Saturday Mornings Were For Kids & Cartoons, Such As This, Ruled The Airway."
5,Two boys' review: Saturday morning cartoons perfect for little boys!,"Our five-year old and four-year old superhero fans won't be watching the PG and PG-13 movies released this summer -- The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man and The Dark Knight (Batman). What can a parent do for little superheroes looking for some wholesome yet exciting action?This two-volume collection, Challenge of the Super Friends, brings back the fun, simple stories that used to fill Saturday cartoon mornings. Parents can rest easy that heroes and villians are clearly identified. The messages are simple, good triumphs over evil.Kids over 10 probably won't be as entertained by the simple stories and animation. However, this collection suits well for parents looking for something relatively safe to entertain younger children."
5,The photos make my 2 year old daughter giggle non-stop,"I bought this book for my 2 year old daughter Sarah. We don't read the words much yet, but the photos are outrageously funny to her. She giggles till it hurts. This book stays on the coffee table."
2,Nice Bag with Zipper Problems,"Nice case, but it has a major problem. The shoulder strap holder digs into the zipper threads causing the zipper to come off track. I bought this new on Amazon and had to have it replaced by Marware after only 6 months of use. The replacement case had the same zipper problem again 6 months later. Contacted Marware again with no response."
5,Best laptop bag for mac,"If you're serious about protecting your macbook pro don't hesitate to get this bag. It isn't cheap but not prohibitively expensive and looks stylish as well. My mac fits in nicely with or without a plastic cover I got here to protect it from scrapes and dings. The accessory compartment also has ample room for other things as well. It has specific compartments that easily fit the power supply, Iphone or Ipod, and a couple of more compartments for whatever you feel like throwing at it."
1,never again,"when product got to us, before we even took it out of package, the knob that would turn the device on and off was not attached to the product and you could tell that it was broken. i took it out, and it still worked, but the on/off switch is definatly broke off. very cheaply made for the money we paid. felt like i could have gotten better product at the dollar store."
5,McCall's Son,Trace McCall has a love relationship with a pretty Shoshoni maiden. Her father does not approve of this relationship and steels her away. The father does not know it but his daughter is with child. She marries a member of the tribe so the child will have a father. She names her son White Eagle. Several years later a renegade band of Sioux raid and kill off most of the Shoshoni people. White Eagle must now wander into the world of the white man looking for his paternal father. Mr. West gives us another great story.
5,Fast Relief,"With a terrible sinus infection, I was miserable. I couldn't sleep because of painful, sinus congestion. I tried steaming my head, and rubbing Vapo-Rub on my cheeks and forehead. Finally I drove to the drugstore and purchased Simply Saline in the blue can (specifically for sinus relief). Within 15 minutes of application, my head was clear, my headache eased, and I could BREATHE! I swear by this product - it may not work for everyone, but it was heaven sent for me. I hope it will work as well for those who suffer with sinus congestion/pain."
5,It clears it up,"Sometimes at work my allergies act up and clog my nose. Thats when I bring this baby out and spray it into my nose. Granted it doesnt unclog the nose immediately it does however remove whatever is causing the allergies and creating a sterile place in your nose and sinus (since saline kills bacteria). So it slowly and naturally unclogs you and reduces post nasal drip. BTW, it also moisturizes your sinus and nasal cavities which I think is really the beneficial part about the whole use of this."
1,Simply Saline,"I purchased this spray because I had a coupon. I had a terrible sinus congestion. I tried to use the bottle and there was no spray -- nothing. I have soaked the cap in warm water and still have no spray. For the cost of this, I would have expected more. From now on I will go to a local pharmacy and purchase the store brand of saline spray."
2,Worst O'reilly I own,"I pretty much go to [...] for everything I need to know about PHP. This book gives the most cursory introduction to every topic from the now extinct MING to CLI PHP, which I'm currently exploring. On CLI, this book doesn't mention how to get command line arguments into your script, for instance. It's pretty easy to do, and figure out if you've used PHP enough and gotten familiar with its api.I've never gotten what I was looking for from this book, except it's reference on array functions is useful."
2,Not Up to Snuff,"When I purchase a Nutshell book from O'reilly, I anticipate a very formal, detailed overview of a language and an in-depth coverage of that language's standardized libraries and features. PHP in a Nutshell is very lax with informal explainations and coverage. I am not saying that the book lacks information; it just lacks the typical detail of a usual Nutshell book. This book also has simple errors that should have been caught if the author had reviewed his own work; this is simply unexceptable. I, today, counted over 4 simple mistakes on the chapter about operators. This is something unheard of from O'reilly. I have been programming with PHP for a while now and was hoping to find a definitive reference ... well, this isn't it!"
4,Fix the *!$@$!* Index!,"I bought this book to lead me into my first foray into PHP. It was just what I needed, except for one problem: the index. Basic PHP functions such as ""print"" and ""echo"" are covered in the text, but you won't find them in the index. The data type ""mixed"" is used in the code examples, but isn't explained anywhere that I could find, and also lacks an index entry. As others have remarked, there are a few errors in the text, but they're pretty obvious and didn't get in the way of writing workable scripts. An excellent introduction to PHP, but a number of needless annoyances."
2,Not a Nutshell Book,"The O'Reilly ""in a Nuthsell"" series is the best reference to standard libraries and language features available. PHP in a Nutshell sullies the name, however, with what amounts to an introductory survey in the course and little, if any, analysis of standard libraries. Certain tips, such as those on flash and pdf handling are interesting, but irrelevant to most programmers. This goes doubly for the discussion of PHP's 2D drawing API; it seems as though the authors decided they would provide a schizophrenic volume which is on the one hand a beginner's tutorial and on the other hand a survey of the more esoteric, unused portions of the language."
3,Decent broad coverage of many PHP basics,"A decent broad coverage of many PHP basics but I didn't really learn much more than I had found on my own by randomly poking around in the online PHP manual every time I needed a function to get a job done. I was hoping that reading a book like this from cover to cover would expose some parts of PHP I missed or teach some techniques and best practice that I didn't figure out myself. Unfortunately it did not.For someone who known no PHP at all (and no C) I would give that a 4 star rating. But every PHP programmer has access to great free online PHP manual so I think this book has less value. And anyone who knows C can start programming PHP right away without reading much of anything. I assume the average programmer knows some C or Java and can read the online PHP manual. For those people, this book is no better than 3."
3,The Best Game,I haven't got it yet but it has awsome stuff! Like jobs and celebs all that stuff. I ttly want it! It rocks out loud! It rocks my world! Yea!
4,Pretty cool movie,"It's about this young underground bareknuckle boxer (Heath Ledger) who runs an errand for the local mob, gets distracted by a girl and screws up, and then an adventure ensues with him running for his life. It's the only Australian movie I can remember seeing other than the Mad Max series, it's different and interesting."
2,Ehhhh,"This movie wasn't worth the money. It's obviously fanmade, but it wasn't what I expected. For the majority of the movie, it just replays the same clips of the boys, and you hardly ever hear them talk. The narrator just goes on and on, and soon it just gets annoying/boring. For huge Directioners, it was a waste because it basically just goes through all the things we already know (like how they formed, etc) ... If you really want to know more about the boys, go watch their ""A Year in the Making"" Documentary. It is so much better."
2,HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY,"What a waste of time and money!I 100 % agree with the other 1-2 star reviews, it is the same rehashed info and interviews with everyone but 1d, they used the same few clips of the boys throughout the entire thing, and the effects were just pathetic.This is a sad, sad attempt at a bio dvd."
4,DVD,It took no time to get item. My Daughter loves one direction and will enjoy watching this movie with friends.
1,Don't buy.. SERIOUSLY,"OHK I got this DVD as a present and I was sooo excited when I got it! I couldn't wait to watch it. I watched and it basically talked about how Harry is the 'lead' singer and it's all about him. The DVD was basically: Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Nia... Harry, Lou... Harry, Lia... Harry, Harry, Zay.. Harry. I lovee Harry but seriously I love One Direction as a band not member. So technically barely anything about Niall, Louis, Liam and Zayn. HUGE let down and I'm very dissapointed with this DVD. I think YouTube compilations(funny moments) are much funnier and informative. I'm a true directioner!! ""How many R's? 6!!"" They didn't show any interviews and they barely spoke. They should have put some videos of them from the X factor or something. Horrible!! Honestly don't buy it.."
1,It's a lady TALKING ABOUT One Direction.,"This NOT a real One Directions DVD. It's a lady TALKING ABOUT One Direction. I only paid $5.70 and it wasn't even worth that. My daughter was SO disappointed. Save your money, don't bother buying this. I didn't read the fine print... it's an unauthorized biography, but that print couldn't have been much smaller."
1,Not Worth It,This was just bad. I bought it from the 5 dollar bin at WalMart and I don't think it was worth that much. It plays the same video clips about 100 times. The stuff talked about was stuff we pretty much all ready knew. The worse part was how much time they spent on Harry and then brushed past the other boys like they weren't as important. I love Harry but it shouldn't be about him all the time. The other boys deserve the same respect. This dvd just isn't worth purchasing in my opinion.
4,LOVE IT,I LOVE this dvd <3 anything about One Direction i loveMy only dislike from it was that in the dvd they didn't speak. <3 <3 <3
5,OMG!,"I love One Direction so much and have no doubt that this movie is going to be totally amaZAYN, fabuLOUIS, phenomeNIALL, briLIAM, and extraordinHARRY. I can't wait to see it!!!"
4,excellent atlas,"The atlas was excellent and easy to refer to. The text, while usable, is brief and has much more information than was necessary at my undergraduate medical level. I recommend using this as an atlas and using a different text (such as Wheater) for accompanying explanations."
3,not a comprehensive guide to histology,This book was required for one of my classes. My only complaint is that it doesn't have enough slides to get to know histology.
1,Horrible,The flow of the text and pages is horrible. The font is huge and causes you to read and scroll through through 10 different pages as opposed to three in the hard copy. The pictures and their captions are on separate pages so its really hard to compare while reading caption because you have to keep flipping back and forth and the fact that you can't ZOOM into pictures makes this WORTHLESS!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good pictures,"This book was a bit helpful because of the colorful pictures, but I think I would have done ok in my Anatomy course without it. I can find these pictures easily on the internet, but it's useful in lab!"
1,Horrible Seller!,"I never received the item I ordered and when I tried contacting the seller multiple times, she never replied back. Do not buy any items at all from this seller! She will rip you off on your money!"
2,didnt need it,"When I was looking at reviews to see If I should buy this book last year, it would have been helpful if someone told me that this book is not going to be used very much, even as a reference. Your schools ppt/notes of histology should be sufficient to grasp the material, this atlas is superfluous."
1,"Great Product, but Highest price I have EVER seen!!","Look somewhere else! My cats do like temptation treats over any other brand, especially the dairy treats, but the price is crazy! I got them last week for $1/each. Yes, it was on sale, but the highest price I have ever seen was $2. Just passing on the information and hope someone finds it useful!"
1,misleading description,"Superseal is a good product, but the description of the storage set is misleading. There are actually only 18 containers with lids. The six pc. measuring spoon set is counted as 6 pcs., not one. The four pc. spatula set is counted as four pcs., not one. The lid holder is not near large enough to hold all the lids. You also get some loose recipe cards, a page of recipes, and a microwave chart page. This is what makes up the ""50 pc. storage set"". As for the packaging, everything was just thrown into a box. I guess that I should have read the fine print better."
3,Good Blood--Light read,"Gideon Oliver, his wife Julie and their friend, Phil Boyajian, are traveling to Italy. Phil is a guide for a bicycle touring group and he has pressed Julie into helping. Gideon goes to be with Julie and to visit Italy again.While Phil and Julie are shepherding the cyclists, Gideon becomes involved in an ancient death that he discovers is a murder. In the meantime, there is a kidnapping of the dead man's relative.This is a very light book, easily read in an afternoon or evening. There was very little suspense or mystery. The best part was discovering how the person was murdered and the murder weapon."
2,"Love the series, but not this one","Lots of flowery prose made me skip sections. Felt really slow, and had some frustrating lack of deductions - ended up relying on non-deductive reasoning to learn the final results...I'm def a fan of his other work!"
5,Every gardener should own,"I'm an avid gardener always searching for more information. This is an endearing story that stimulated my passion for the quest in the never ending garden projects. My garden is evolving continuously and reading others dreams and realities is so important to get new perspectives. This book is one of my favorites so far, she is so descriptive and entertaining. I bought this as a gift for my mother and sister who also enjoy gardening."
4,Gardning tool,"A reference tool that is invaluable long after purchased; easy to follow, it is as tho sydney is right beside you!"
1,Self-taught?,"I think this is a bogus book on gardening by a complete novice who wants to cash in on the ""gardening book"" market. Self-taught? If you want a highly successful garden, get a book where the author has a botanical background from a university. You will get farther faster. Why do you think amazon slashed the price to $5.98? Come on! Sydney Eddison might as well write a book on ""The Self-Taught Floor Cleaner; Lessons from a House""."
5,Current Geriatric Diagnosis and Treatment,I studied from various Lange medical textbooks and Current Diagnosis and Treatment texts extensively in medical school and residency. I have found them to be up to date and packed with practical information. Current Geriatric Diagnosis and Treatment is of the same quality that I've become used to with Lange medical publications.
3,Information Overload,The book presents tons of information as a 12-step active investor recovery program. Although I found much of this information insightful it does seem to me that ultimately in trying to prove a point a clear sales pitch shines through which does not agree with me too much.
3,This book gets half of it right,"Great pictures, great insight into index funds, unfortunately book is a guise to lure you to the author's practice."
2,Richly Based Marketing,"Save your money - you'll need it to invest through these folks. Your ROI will be better served by visiting the IFA web site if you're interested in this advisor - what's in the book is pretty much the same information, just not the high gloss stuff. Index funds are a great thing - and though the DFA funds which make up the IFA portfolios are stellar performers - you're going to need some serious $$$$ to get in. If you want to learn about index funds for the average individual investor, look elsewhere for information which you can use."
5,This is a Great Learning Tool,"My kid loves this CD. It has one of those catchy tunes that you just can't get out of your head. This is probably the worst thing about the CD however my 1st grader has learned a great many things just from listening to the CD over and over. Details about the continents, the position of the sun in different parts of the world at different times, the solar system. What more can you ask? Great product!"
3,ok great beat but just repeats...,The music has a great beat but every song is the same they just say the numbers over and over again. There are no other lyrics. Try Hip Hop Rap much better. It even gives a strategy on how to remember the process for each number....It rocks and raps...!!!
5,high quality ingredients,"I have used this massage oil for several weeks and love the non-greasy light feel on the skin. The ingredients are all natural vegetable oils, such as grape seed oil, and flower extracts. I mix this with a blend of oils and use it for muscle and arthritis pain with no concerns about getting the oil blend on clothing when used appropriately. I would definately buy this again."
5,Harold and the Purple crayon,"When I ordered this book, I didn't know what to expect, but it was certainly left to the imagination and alot of fun. My grandkids are 4 and 6 and enjoyed it and especially to see what Harold was going to do with the Purple Crayon next. It gave them the concept that they can draw anything. Great job."
5,You won't believe how good you will feel.,"I first found Est-Aid in a small nutrition store. For me, it made such a difference to my well-being. I was experiencing hot flashes every hour; sleeping was difficult; work was rough. And I was very cranky.You have to follow the label directions for the best effect; I take 2 Est-Aid every morning. It took 7-10 days for the formula to really begin to work well, but now I'm free of hot flashes, mood swings and I can live again. I would tell every woman over 45+ I know about this product."
4,An ideal companion to Martin Fowler Refactoring book,"An ideal companion to Martin Fowler's Refactoring book. Wake delivers a more practical oriented book, with a generous amount of relevant examples and code listings. Compared to Fowler's seminal title this one, due to its ""workbook"" nature, is much more Java-centric, making it harder to translate certain concepts to different languages and environments. In my opinion a very interesting and informative book, somewhat affected by a confused typographical layout not very well suited to its content. Just remember to read Fowler's book first!"
4,Makes Refactoring Real,"This book proved to be an excellent learning tool during a refactoring session at my eXtreme Programming Users Group meeting. We discussed most of the covered refactorings, divided into pairs, and went through several of the exercises (many of which had downloadable code). Thereafter, each pair discussed their approach with the entire group. I must say the book accomplished its goal: To give novices and veterans alike the chance to gain or sharpen refactoring skills. I highly recommend this book and suggest its use within a group."
5,Improving code is key to building a quality enterprise,"Learning to make what you already have better WITHOUT negatively impacting the enterprise or rewriting what you already have is a key skill that this book teaches and preaches. Understanding what it means to successfully refactor something is well worth the effort, especially if you are interested in getting into the world of service oriented architecture.Services can be refactored after they are deployed because they can maintain a consistent external interface or contract that others form dependencies to. THis allows us to apply the concepts and techniques described in this book in order to build not only increasingly robust code but also increasingly valuable code in the form of reusable services.The author does a good job of organising the content and explaining the application through examples. This book is helping my team with a specific project that requires us to revisit but no rewrite a collection of existing components."
4,the grass is always greener,"This is a very touching story of a family grasping to belong, but not quite making it. They try living beyond their means, almost living out a fantasy. Yet, only their surrounds alter. The family and marital difficulties are still there and the financial issues only add to these troubles. In the end true happiness and contentment are still just out of their reac"
5,Tebow for President!!,"This guy has to be the nicest, biggest role model the sports world has ever seen! His life really plays out like a movie and the ending i feel will be just as spectacular! Watch this and not be at least a little bit of a fan.. The man has overcome so much...hello?? if his mother listened to her doctors he wouldnt even be alive today!(google his birth) People seem to hate him just because he believes in Jesus Christ and is a ""good"" guy. In a corrupt sports world this man has stood out above the rest. Sure he isnt the best QB, yet he was easily the most talked about athlete in 2011!! Just wait till he becomes a ""elite"" QB, wins a MVP award and maybe a Super Bowl! This DVD is just a prequel to what i believe to be a stellar NFL career! A possible future in politics? The sky is the limit for this great young man!!"
1,Disappointing,"Bought this hoping for an inspirational video for youth. I have respect for all that Tim has been doing, but this video is a sort of home movie tracking him through hs rigorous training over coming the ney sayers til he finally gets drafted That's all."
5,Inspirational and Entertaining look at one of college football's alltime greats,"Great documentary that gives you an inside look at Tebows home life, which I found to be completely enjoyable to watch, and I have watched it over and over. Must see if you are a Tebow fan."
3,Tim is awesome but movie is boring,"The movie concentrates too much on his draft getting into the NFL, and it was not very exciting. I wish it showed more about his whole life. A movie needs to be made that is based on his book ""Through My Eyes""."
2,Not what it claims to be,"One of the other reviewers noted that this book has a deceptive title, and I completely agree. There are very few games in this book, and most of them aren't really games--they're more like tricks. The book is about how babies learn and how their brains develop, not about games that you can play to help them grow.If you want to know about child development, then it's a fine book. But if you want a book with ideas for games to play with your baby, you don't want this book."
3,prefer Perlmutter's Raise a Smarter Child by Kindergarten,"If you are looking for more activities / games to play with your child, there are over 30 in chapter 3 of David Perlmutter's book, Raise A Smarter Child by Kindergarten."
4,A great gift for new parents,"As a new father, I can recommend this book to other new parents interested in learning more about how learning and memory development works, and how much fun playing with your baby can be.This book will help you enjoy play-time even more, in that it demonstrates that children learn and develop best when doing just what they naturally want to do-play and laugh with us.If you have friends with a new baby, this book will make a nice gift they will remember you for."
4,Practical book,"This book helps the parent that is hesitant in thinking up games for the child by herself. The authors explain how the child develops here brain by play. The principle is to observe your child carefully while interacting and let him or her surprise you. This is the starting point of your and her/his discoveries together. Furthermore, they explain the principle of sign language for children. Babies can understand a lot before their vocal chords are fully developed. Simple sign language can help you and your child to communicate early on and thus to develop quicker. It is a well written book that is structured and can be read quickly and in bits and pieces."
5,Great information for parents!,"This book is amazing, showing us, the parents, just what our babies really can do! The authors empasize on the importance of the childs emotions, how to connect with your baby in a way that will not only teach your baby but give them a loving relationship to bond with their parents. This book is an excellant choice for anyone who wants to look beyond their childs outerbeing and really understand so much more.Mother of 4"
2,Authors really stretched 3 pages of info into a whole book.,"I found about 3 useful tips in the entire book. Not that the information was inaccurate, just very piece meal and basic. If one is not very well versed with how the entire environment affects a child then this book may be of some use.For me, the data pulled from isolated studies and extrapolated into theories on how to enhance brain function was weak. I HIGHLY reccomend going with the Glen Doman series ('How to teach you baby to read', 'How to teach you baby math' etc.). They are based decades of proven work with real parents teaching real children and getting real (superior) results. Do be fooled by the 'baby minds' lack of approach. Get the kits, they are fun and they work!"
3,Expected something different,"While I think this is a great book, I expected it to be a better resource of games. It is more general than expected and you have to wade through the chapters to find the game suggestions. This makes it more difficult to use as a resource later when you are likely to want to look up games for a specific age-group. While they do have a ""Tips Revisited"" chapter where they list the games by age, I wasn't pleased with the generalness of the descriptions given. I just wasn't excited about the organization of the book. I much preferred ""Your Baby's Mind"" by S. H. Jacobs (except his dismissal of early exposure to books). I did however love the book ""Baby Signs' by these same authors."
4,Good ideas but limited,"This book is totally excellent in encouraging parents to stimulate their baby's mind from birth.But he is rather limited in some ways. It is all about stimulating logic, not so much about creativity.For example, the authors believe that a good MEMORY is what is needed to excel at school. That is what is wrong with the school system! We need to stimulate the ability to think, not just to remember.So, in addition to this book, have your baby look at things of NATURE, where there is infinite variations. eg silk roses, hang spirals, pictures of nature - not just geometric black and white things."
3,Interesting but wordy,"This is an interesting book and it goes into detail about little minds, but some of it may be too technical for parents who just want to learn the games and not why or how they stimulate. Some parents might not have time to read all the background info and would like to just get down to the fun part, which is a little bit difficult with this book. Still, if you have the time to devote to this book, it really is interesting and enlightening and may encourage you to try to develop even more games to stimulate your child's growing mind which is certainly a good thing!"
4,A smart baby is a good Citizen,Teach your baby's mind to develop using the techniques in this book. Don't underestimate that importance of reacting to the Fast-Growth early stages of the infant mind. This book will help ANYONE to teach your baby to learn better.
1,not a good choice,"I am the mother of new twins and I do not have a lot of time on my hands. What I was looking for in this book was specific games to play with my new babies to stimulate them and engage them. However, this book goes into lengthy details about the development of the babies brain, gives all types of theories on neurological development. If I wanted that I would have bought a text book. I am not impressed with this book at all."
2,I threw it out,"This is not a book of brain-building games but and child phsych textbook which I don't have time to read because I work full time and spend lots of time interacting with my baby. I didn't find any activities in this book, more like advice on how to interact during activites with your baby. I would return the book but for 10 dollars its not worth the trouble to me so I am gonna toss it in the trash, don't need more useless stuff cluttering up the house."
5,The only book that offer practical advices,"I would give this book 4 STARS if I found another book in the same area that is better. The book offers many practical advices to produce a child with an advance and healthy mind. When I finished reading the book, I thought that it was written in a very primitive level, but after buying a few more books on the subject, I understood that this book must be in everyone's library in addition to a few other books."
2,Move in Wrong Direction,"What is this. The reason Sothern Discomfort was good is because of the rapper and the just off my 7 day crack binge I'm Insane Crazy feel to it. The beats and ramdomnization of Southern Discomfort is what made it cool, not to mention the wacked out lyrics with a dysfunctional motivational twist.Buy Southern Discomfort to here a great album that breaks barriers.This album sounds like the same o'l stuff everyone else is making."
2,Only one good song,"If you are buying this CD for the bartender song that is all you are going to get, the rest of the cd is no good."
5,their music,this is the BEST ReHab cd EVER. the lyrics and songs are better on this than any other album they have out. bartender? WAY better on this album. end of story
4,REHAB Clean Version,"I enjoy REHAB'S music and purchased the ""Clean"" version. I was disipointed that their clean version has ausio edits (audio distortion) over the profanity rather than the radio version which uses other lyrics in place of the profanity. Other than the editing process, the CD is great."
4,REHAB - A HIT,"I ordered this CD because I listened to the sample of the ""Bartender Song"" and liked it. When I received the CD and ran through all of the tracks I discovered a group that is very diverse. There is quite a mixture of Rock and Hip-Hop. The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 star rating, there are a few songs that just aren't relevant to me in particular. Listen to all of the sample tracks if you think you might like the CD order it, once you can run through the whole CD I don't think you will be disappointed.Greg"
4,Just when you thought you heard everything....,"I'm blown away. I have recently been listening to Arcade Fire, Queens o'the Stoneage, this one caught me off guard. There's not a bad track on this thing. Buying 3, 1 for me, 2 for gifts to people that don't how lucky they are that I do all this footwork to weed out the crap music."
2,Hmmm...,"I'm unimpressed. The guys have great voices, but the music just isn't there. It's good, just not really _them_. I thought Cuzwecan was a great evolution from Southern, but this is just not the Rehab I love. *sob*Kinda makes me wonder why they didn't just RELEASE the massive 2-CD Cuzwecan... seems like free money!"
1,Just doesn't square with the facts,"The account in this so-called ""book"" just does not match up with the fact. A military journalist working in a major headquarters at Camp Victory was simply not in as many combative situations and danger as the author leads us to believe. His descriptions of his fellow soldiers also leads me to suspect his true motives. Were they really all so dumb? I somehow doubt it. There is too much fantasy mixed with tidbits of truth for this account to add to anyone's understanding of the situation in Iraq. Besides -- it sure seems like he was able to get to the swimming pool quite often. You would be hard pressed to find very many soldiers that were able to regularly make that trip. Move quickly to the next book and toss this one out."
1,No way is this right,"This may go down as the single worst ""account"" of the war. Whether you are for or against the war, you learn absolutely nothing of use from the ramblings of this daily diary posing as a ""book."" It just shows that anything can get published today, especially if you pay for it yourself. What is wrong in it? Notice how everyone is dumb but him? If he is so ""honest"" why is he did he not mention his loss of rank? He sees himself, delusionally, as misunderstood warrior who would solve everything if only they listened to him. What crap. Any so-called officer who writes in a good review should have his head examined. It is probably a fake anyway. The scribbler, he doesn't rate the word author or even writer, should head back to the pool where it appears he spent much of his time."
1,awful,"i worked with this guy for almost 2 years and i have to say he is one of the worst people i ever met.he was always sneaking out of work to hit the lake so he could ride his wave runner. his work load was pretty easy compaired to other jobs in the army and he did it poorly. the stories he sent back from Iraq (all two of them) were about his time at the pool getting a tan. there is a pattern here.i am glad the army doesnt want him anymore and he is no longer serving this great country.there are better books, written by better people who actually did some REAL good in Iraq. read them."
5,this kid is smart,"I live in New York and have heard him on the radio several times. He runs circles around those that are critical of him or the book. I just finished his book, and loved almost all of it. I wished he had written more about his home life upon his returna and where everyone ended up.This book is historical and a superb demostration that are military is smart!"
1,Tall Tails,"I was deployed (1st Cav) with this guy and i know people who worked directly with him, this book is a load of crap.PFC Kiver (he got demoted in Iraq) is getting a DISHONORABLE discharge from the Army. i wonder why he didnt put that information in the book?go buy an honest book of what its like in Iraq, and dont listen to this FRAUD!"
1,Not Very Good,"I read this book and i have to say it was very poorly written, like a junior high school student book report about his summer vacation."
1,Military Intel for dummies,"Phil Kiver's presentation is very slick Pentagon propaganda. The ""everything is coming up roses"" nonsense is comical, and his cheap shots at people like John Kerry are transparent.Kiver has a bright future in service to the Neocon Noise Machine."
1,Not worth reading,"I know a lot about the former Private Kiver (he's no longer in the Army), and much of what he wrote is distorted and some of it is completely wrong. He constantly gives the impression that if things didn't go his way all the time, then his leaders were wrong and getting in his way. How can one person be so full of himself?A lot of Iraqi war veterans wrote, good, factual books that tell an accurate story. This is not one of them. You have to question the honesty and integrity of a person who goes to Iraq as a Specialist, leaves Iraq as a Private First Class, and leaves the Army as a Private."
1,This guy's a pogue,"My wife got this book for free at a book exchange, but I got a chance to look at it before she started reading it. This guy's a joke. He actually wants to go to ""the front lines"" (there hasn't been such a thing since the Korean War) so he can see some action. He's a greenhorn FNG until the end. He's extremely misguided and racist toward Arab and Muslim cultures. He the ugly American who embarrasses all of us, yet he has a job in public affairs. Curiously, as a ""journalist"", you'd think he'd have some writing chops, but it's strictly junior high level stuff.And, it must have been nice to have to coms to call home whenever he felt like it."
5,"Riveting, from the gut","Having lost a son in this war, I am thirsty for any accounts of the ""real"" feedback of some one who has been there, and Phil has. I have met the author in person just recently and wanted to hear more of his story. I find it hard to put down, so much that the average American nevers hears of, about this war, is found in the pages of Phil's journal.It is written from the gut, no flowery adjectives, just the real story, so refreshing when it comes to accounts of what has and continues to happen. I wish that the media would tell the stories of the hope, renewal and justification of our troops finishing the job they were sent to do, with pride and honor."
4,A glimpse into one soldier's world,Enjoyed the book. It is a journal not a literary work of art and as such I enjoyed simply following with this young man's day to day thoughts and observations in Iraq.
3,182 Days in Iraq,"Enjoyable reading, but the author was somewhat spoiled under the circumstances he was serving. The journal entries could have been more detailed."
4,Excellent read,"I know Kiver and he is just really passionate and animated in real life as he is in this book. I appreciate a soldier's perspective from his time in war.Keep up the good work, Kiver!"
3,Too restrained,"Benny Hill was obviously feeling pressure from political correctness at this point, as the Hill's Angels segments are far less raunchy and more covered up than in the previous sets. Benny obviously tries to go for cuteness by using children in the filmed comedy segments(they aren't bad,but they're no substitute for a bald guy getting his head slapped). It gets kind of tiresome after a while."
5,benny hill set 6,"recieved the product right away, dvd was exactaly as described. thank you5 stars for service & quality, sorry about any typo's :b"
5,Great book for horse lovers who want a job in their field,"Sue Reynolds has put together a great reference book...it is very comprehensive but easy to read. It is filled with handy checklists and I definitely enjoyed the personal stories and perspectives in each chapter. Sue covers EVERYTHING, from equine schools, getting a job, starting a business to various professions (vet, horse breeder, trainer, farrier, writer, manufacturer, to name a few). Each chapter has a list of resources so I know where to find more information. This book would be helpful for young people, and for anyone wanting to get into the horse industry or switch careers. I highly recommend it!"
2,Disney does breast cancer - no real information here.,"The author discounts or ignores many of the options and treatments that most breast cancer patients need to consider, without adequate information for dismissing them. Why wasn't she on tamoxifen? Why couldn't she consider implants with reconstruction to balance the existing breast? Why was chemotherapy never even discussed? It seems she never consulted an oncologist. Why? If you're > Stage 1, skip this."
1,Not relevant to my experience,"I read part of this book and then put it down and gave it away. In the book, the woman has breast cancer and surgery, and that's it. Surgery was only the first part of my experience with breast cancer, and I was looking for more."
5,Excellent Gel Pen,Very pretty and sophosticated looking pen. It will make others jealous..watch out for the pen theives. Writes smoothly and consistently. Blue is very nice. One of the best.
4,It works as advertized,I tested it by soaking a piece of paper with the ink for 1 hour: there was only a slight smearing. It works as advertized.
4,Nice pens.,"I like these pens, they are nothing fancy and I will stick to my favorites but I do not regret buying these. So far they have not started to skip/dry out."
4,Release yoursefl,An excellent primer that may help you begin to deconstruct the stories that imprison you.Jennifer Loudenhttp://www.comfortqueen.com
4,"absolutely fabulous, punk rock, kick a**","these girls are the cutest, they know all about the angst of dealing with boys, but they don't let it get to them. Great for dancing, or fighting with your boyfriend. Cuter than Buffy herself"
4,It makes getting dumped fun!,"Poppy punk trio with soft vocals from Rose. Very Cub-ish, but I think I like GS a little better. Anyone who can not identify with these songs was probably a dork in highschool (like me). Ex-cheerleaders and jocks need not apply."
4,The blurb from the website,"I actually haven't used this book, but thought it might be helpful to post the blurb from the Precept Ministries website, since it offers a little more information. Here it is: ""Mine the treasures of the Scriptures of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, and discover what God expects of believers in all areas of life including faith, deeds, morality, leadership, and attitude. Challenge yourself to walk in power, love, and discipline as outlined in these vital books of the New Testament."" This series of books typically requires 30-60 minutes of study per lesson. Hope this additional info is helpful to someone."
3,Great story!,"I am very excited to now own this book. I have been looking for this story ever since I did a children's lit review in college. Once I cleaned the cover (front and back) with some soap and water and let the book air out (There was a musty scent, a smell I do not enjoy, made worse by an early pregnancy:), it is ready to go. I am delighted that this book will now be a part of my daughter's literary collection."
5,"From celibate nympho, all the way through.","Adventures of Prescott... Celibate Nympho will obtain and keep your attention from beginning to end with its realistically funny humor. As the quick but great read goes on, the story and characters unfold smoothly. The classic lines and real life plot are made great by the characters and their individualistic personalities. Though not everybody will find a resonance with the cynical main character named Jed, having siblings can bring your streams of life closer with his. Adventures of Prescott: an original piece of work, full of emotion and worth your time."
1,The Worst Game,"I bought this game hoping for a Casino (hence the name) type of gambling experience.....well, it was nearly impossible to maneuver around the Casino, When I selected a game to play, the machine played a totally different game!! The sound was obnoxious and the graphics were blurry!! I cleaned my glasses several times thinking that no one would put out a blurry video game!!!! Don't waste your money on this game!!!!"
5,"Nice Bio's, Very Informative","All the bio's last no more than 30 minutes & start from childhood to death.It goes into some deep details about the artists and who commissioned them.Shows beautiful artworks, too.I ordered these because I wanted to show them to the Elementary, Middle School & High School kids I work with.Out of all the great artists listed I would only be able to show two artists because there is nudity."
5,Great information,This is a great review and sometimes new information about these great masters of art. Good for the young and old viewers.
1,Not 3 inch Wide,Although the Amazon advertising copy says that this tape is 3 inches wide - it is actually the more standard 2 inch (or just shy of this - metric equivalent)
1,"More stinky, less sticky.","This tape is not very sticky. It's terribly stinky. It's flimsy and about 90% of the time, I find that a box that I taped up the night before has the tape hanging off in the morning. This is the case on new boxes, used boxes, etc. This tape is a major fail and even though I'm not enamored of the 3M tape, it looks like I'll be going back until I find something better."
3,misleading title,"I'm displeased that this item was listed as ""2 x 60yd Packaging Tape 3 Pack"", I expected six rolls. Now I find out that what you they was 2 inches x 60yd.This was a poor choice for a title of the product that is described as 1.88 inches wide."
5,Great tape!,This is the best tape for your money. Very strong and sticks easily. I had a lot of problems with the national brand tape that is well-known. Duck tape has always been higher quality for me. Highly recommend!
3,Bizzarre world Of Henry...,"Henry Rollins is a interesting character, Very Anti-Social it seems at times, This book gives you the insight into the Hardcore Punk Lifestyle, being on the road, the violence involved, Including some cool pics, and info, especially on my favorite(way better than Black Flag IMHO) The Misfits. The Famous Motley Crue Story is in here."
4,The road can be hell-in case you're wondering,"Some might say...""Why should I read an account of a band and the day to day hell they lived through?"" Personally, I took a look around after reading this book and determined how easy most of us really have it. Get in the van gave me a bit more personal strength and slightly different perspective on the weak people around me. Strong book from the man!"
3,Started strong -,"This book sucks - Rollins seems like an ok guy at the beginning but you get so tired of his constant loner meets crybaby attitude. Everything seems like a struggle to him. This book is comprised of pictures and journal entries, I love Black Flag but this book is boring. Rollins is self centered and boring constantly seeking the spotlight and then acting as if it is not what he wants, listen to him talk on his cd's or read any of his books, it seems as though his attitude towards others is poor - almost like ---I Just want to be left alone - - if that is the case then why is he performing on saturday night live - acting in movies- going on MTV????? lets not forget the Gap ads.. I used to really like Rolins and I still listen to his music but sometimes I just don't get it. if you do buy this be sure to buy the second edition as it has way more pics and pettibone art."
3,A mostly great book,The parts of this book where Henry was on tour were a great read. The parts where he sat in the shed and b****** about his success were terrible. I just wish I had the success he did so I could complain so much. A mostly great book but not the best.
1,Made me dislike Black Flag,"I used to like a lot of Black Flag. All this account did was make me believe what everyone used to say against punks. Un-educated, mis-directed anger etc.....Rollins is not a smart man, nothing insightful here and the sometimes entertaining accounts of shows and tours wears thin pretty quickly."
1,oh shut up,It was bad enough when all the ex-hippies went on their nostalgia trips about fifteen years or so ago. Now it's the aging punkers who are getting all misty-eyed about the night they smashed some kid's head into the stage or got laid in the back of a smelly van. Rollins is a meathead and the poor writing displayed in this book proves it.
3,WHY $200????,After hearing excerpts i thought it sounded interesting. I just orded a used copy but how could it go for $200 new? Am I mistaken?
4,Great pen.,"The pens work well on all materials (paper stock) I tried, the ink flows smoothly and doesn't seem to blot or smear. I hope I will never have to find out whether or not they protect from forgery. They have a very comfortable grip and are pleasant to write with."
2,Worst Pens I have ever used,These pens produce the most uneven ink I've ever seen in any kind pf pens. I have to push down on the pens really hard to make sure the words will actually get written down. Total waste of money.
4,Good Product,"I like these pens, but they take just a little too long to dry. It might be a problem if the user is left-handed, depending on how he/she holds the pen. I used one to write on my wall calendar and the ink really smudged. I think these are mainly for checks, so for that purpose, I'd say they're pretty good."
2,"""SKIP"" THIS PEN","I wasn't looking for the worlds best pen, just something dependable for everyday use. Unfortunately my search isn't over. Be careful what you wish for - dependable it is - rarely does it fail to skip at the top of at least two letters every other word. I had planned on using them up anyway before buying something else, but it has become so annoying that I can't wait any longer. I will replace them with my next order. Wish that I had ""skipped"" this purchase..."
1,Worst pen ever!! Ink blots and smears!,Bought these on impulse and wanting to get out of the store. My first use revealed ink on my hands due to ink built up on the tip and smearing the wrapping of the package and ending up on my fingers.Ink blots. It leaks. All pens in the package I purchased had this problem. It is CHEAP in quality and price. Not worth the gas to take it back to the store or bother sending to manufacturer. That is probably expected by the company.
4,"Excellent, even flow pen","Usually, my problem with pens is they fail to write properly because of the spotty ink flow. These seem to be fairly nice pens for the price. The batch I got all seem to write fluidly and smoothly. That's not to say you may get the occasional pen that fails to write when it should. That would be asking too much expecting perfection from dollar writing instruments. But I like them enough to order again."
2,Not a good gel pen.,"I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and holding a pen is sometimes difficult. Pushing hard on a pen to write is even worse. That is why I like gel pens, they are very easy for me to write with. I bought the 12 pack of the uni-ball 207 Signo and I am only on the first pen....but so far it skips constantly while I write. Very annoying."
5,All you need to read is chapter 4 to pass your exam!,"This book is awesome! All you need to read and study are pages 61-120 of this book and you will pass your exam on the first try. I took the exam yesterday for the first time and I aced it. The 4 practice exams included in this book, plus the tests on the included cd are awesome. As a matter of fact, the practice tests on the cd are 10 times harder than the actual exam...I couldn't pass them but I passed the actual exam that mattered. Do yourself a favor, if you want to pass the Texas real estate exam, pick up this book!"
4,Frookie cookies plus,"The item (cookbook) arrived in really good condition, and quickly. The recipes surprised me as there are more than ""just"" the simple cookies with fruit juice in them; there are a variety of recipes for every meal and snacks and drinks. I look forward to trying all of them."
1,Paint taste alike,I bought your cookies thinking thinking that they were nutter butters. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't even finish one and my kids threw up. Why don't you just stop making them they are hurting the economy!-Thinkyourcookiesaregood Thinkagain
4,These shoes are great but....,"First of all let me say I LOVE these shoes! So comfortable and the chrome bottom looks great on stage with cool lighting. The only problem I had with this shoe was that after a month (of wearing them about 30 hours a week) the buckle broke off. I have no idea how this happened and I've never had this happen before, so I think it's just a fluke. I am attempting to fix it, but if it doesn't work I'll definitely buy them again. They look awesome!"
4,Good Service,I like the band and so far watch is keeping good time. I would buy another and suggest it to others.
5,It's almost like his 25 year old Timex watch which he loves.,"For a man who is 80 and has had a timex for 25 years, and the buttons to set date and time were getting to be a bear to work, this watch was as close to his old one that I could find. For 45 minutes he told me to send it back. The display wasn't as easy to read as his old one, you can't change the battery yourself, and he couldn't get the hang of setting the date and time. I patiently walked him through it (it's not as easy as the old one was, buy easy enough). Then I turned him on to the indigo light which brought on a grin. He could now see the time very clearly. It's not easy today trying to find a watch that is as durable and easy to set as the Timex of old but I think we came close. Big mistake watch makers make today is making them too complicated, too big, and too ugly. We are very pleased with this one and if Timex has not scrimped on it's durability, Grandpa should have this watch for years to come."
5,It works for me,"Because of my work I find that my watches will last me about nine years. Then I buy the same Timex model.I have been doing this for about forty years. I adjust the timing about once a month with my radio clocks and I maintain the timing of my manual clock collection regularly.I will keep buying them if they keep making them, because they keep on ticking."
4,Timex still ticking,"This is the second Timex Indiglo I've had. The first one died in an accident after about 6 years of faithful service, and probably protected my wrist for more damage than it might have had. The band fits well, it's easy to read and not too large and heavy for my old bones."
2,"Function great, Wear poor","I've bought several of these watches. Like the others, I appreciate the functions and the simplicity. Unfortunately, this watch uses a very cheap method of plating chrome metal over a plastic base. After 1-2 years of wear, this plating fails, and seperates from the base material. This creates very sharp little ""knife blades"" on the edge of the case. With the stretch band, you have to pull it on/off over your hand. The back of my hand is always covered with scratches caused by the plating on the watch case. So, I have several of these, still running perfectly, in drawers un-usable. A poor manufacturing/design. I would assume the gold is similar."
3,Looks Geat,"This watch is the best looking digital watch I've been able to find in years. Its real metal case is so much nicer than the plastic cases found on most digitals. I've been using a Timex digital with much more functionality. I miss the countdown timer and the ability to use the Indiglo light in the stop-watch mode. I also miss the ability to turn off the hourly chime. Reading the functional description before ordereing, it was not clear to me how limited the functions of this watch were. So, I'm disaponted by the limited functionality, but delighted in the appearance."
5,great watch,"low priced - keeps great time - I get one every 5 years or so, when it comes time to put in a fresh battery"
4,Too simple,I bought these watches to use during trainings or outdoors.The do not any functions except simple alarm.Well made but wrist-let could be a little longer.
1,unusable,"The display is far too dark to read in normal room lighting conditions.The date display is too small and the day-of-the-week is even smaller, requiring a magnifying glass to read it.Timex should forget about the ""indiglo"" feature and just have a more reflective/higher contrast background like Casio to make the black LCD characters stand out.A smaller nit is that the watch band is too small for anybody but a teenager.This is the first item I've ever had to return to Amazon."
4,Replacement watch,The watch is just what I expected. It arrived within the time frame promised. I am satisfied with both the watch and service.
5,Takes a licking,Takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I've been using this model watch at work for 30+ years. Why stop now?
3,Timex Watch,"I haven't received it, yet. When I receive it, I will be better able to comment on it. Do you see?Just got it, a day after my above comment. Anyway, this is my second watch of the same brand and model, because I like it. I't easy to see,has the date, and lights in the dark."
2,"Good for Laughs, Not Much Else","I rented this from the public library because the box art made it look terrible. I was quietly disappointed to discover that I was correct in my initial impression. What you see is what you get with this movie- pathetic voice acting (I counted like 4 VAs, tops), animation akin to an old episode of Scooby-Doo, and plenty of racism thinly veiled beneath an educational veneer. Also, all the Native Americans are pretty much white.The only good thing about this film is the vaguely historical events it drops in on from time to time and the fact that you will probably piss yourself laughing at all the googly-eyed facial expression, derpy proportions, and the stiff mockery of humanity that Madacy has presented us with.Essentially, don't waste your money on this. Don't buy this for your grandchildren or your 6th grade history class. Rent it from the library or don't bother."
1,This book was so bad it wouldn't even burn!!,"I admit I was intrigued by the title and thought that maybe it would be worth reading. The truth is that none of the boring little sayings in this book hit home. I think that maybe I am too young, or not ""swishy"" enough for this little book. I see it more for the gay-scarf-wearing-pasty-white crowd that wears polyester pants and lives with mother well into their sixties. So if you are a much older gay man who decorates with doilys and enjoys wine from a milk carton then this book is for you, for the rest...don't bother!!!"
5,Unexpected benefits-Love it!!!,"I bought this because it had a great smell. I have had a condition on my foot for over 15 years and have tried all the doctors meds and natural solutions possible and could never find relief from the itching, buring and sorness until I used this product. It only took one use and I saw and felt results! I have now suggested it to my dad who had a similar contion on his legs and it also helped him instantly. So although it works great as a massage oil, it has a permanant place in our home in our medicine bag. We use it for minor cuts, burns, bug bites, etc."
3,Don't Get It,Detox ? Not so sure bout that but we like all the products from Plantlife so check out the lavender.
5,Best Conditioner I've Ever Used,"I have tried hundreds of different conditioners over the years, from the cheapest of the cheap to the most ridiculously expensive. It's been a constant quest to find the ultimate conditioner for my hair. Ever since I found Rusk's Calm conditioner, I no longer have to spend my time searching. This is it! The concentrated formula makes a little go a very long way, and the smell is fabulous. My long hair is tangle free, soft and shiny after each use. It's like a miracle in a bottle."
4,Happy with the product and service,I started with a few sample packs of this before looking for it here online. I was happy with the price and service of the supplier as well as the performance of the product.
4,Fiction: Often More True Than Fact,"One of the best books among the many about infantry combat. That it is fictional detracts not one iota. The author quite obviously writes from experience and makes use of the freedom fiction provides to paint a powerful and realistic picture of ground warfare, particularly the randomness through which men live and die. As one who fought in the infantry during the Battle of the Bulge, the setting for Mr. Boyd's novel, and produced three highly researched chapters about it in a memoir, I am proud to recommend ""The Gentle Infantryman"" as an authentic account of the way it was. Fiction can indeed be more true than fact. This honest little book is a primary example."
5,Here Is A Man,"President A. Lincoln marveled at the qualities of both American armies in the Civil War because they were made up of ordinary men who were extraordinary citizens of their nations. Bill Boyd shows us the enduring qualities of the American soldier of 1945 in his quiet, compelling account of an ordinary young American who saw the best and worst of men in combat. His story is poignant and harsh. The harshest truth is left for us to ponder: How would today's young American stand the test he took? Other military experts have tried to make us hear what our re-discovered admiration for ""the greatest generation"" seems to confirm: Since Viet Nam we've lost the innocence and courage displayed in this book. That legacy,""we died today for your tomorrow"" as the inscription at another unkown field of WW II says, may not have endured outside the pages of this amazing testament. He makes us proud, and humble."
5,Wharton Tiers at last!,"Wharton Tiers is best known for twisting the knobs on some of the great underground (and not so underground) recordings of the 80s and 90s--Sonic Youth, Helmet, Dinosaur Jr., to name but few of the bands he's worked with--but here he is stepping out with his own recordings, playing solo and with others. His drumming can only be described as ""thunderous"", and the sound is trying very hard to squeeze out through the speakers. The overtones are amazing, the whole sound is transcendant. Amongst the best of the NYC art-rock scene..."
4,Circle fun!,"This book was a gift for my son, and I began reading it with him when he was 18 months old. That was a year ago. It is a sweet good night book with a sing-song rhythm and cute illustrations. My son enjoys pointing out the circles on each page, and this book remains a favorite before bed in our house."
4,A surprisingly good film,"Maybe it was that this was an ""After Dark Horrorfest"" title that made me expect complete crap, but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Pacing-wise it's on the slow side, but the multiple plot twists during the climax are a worthy trade-off.If I didn't know this was a work of fiction I might have thought it a documentary. The direction and cinematography have that kind of feel, and the cast felt more like real people talking than actors saying lines. Coupled with the third act payoff, the end result is a subtle, creepy story with a decent emotional center. ""Lake Mungo"" is a great example of what a low-budget horror movie can be with a strong concept and the right talent bringing it to life."
1,Pure Sh-eye-T!,"Boring, colorless, drab, dreary, dry, dull, flat, insipid, lackluster, lifeless, tedious, unanimated, uninspired, vapid, wearisome, flavorless, ho hum, humdrum, monotonous, nothing, unexciting, uninteresting, unstimulating."
4,Nice Subtle Horror Film,I caught this film at the recent AfterDark Horrorfest and was very plesantly surprised. The performances were so convincing that at first I thought it really was a documentary that had been included with the rest of the Horrorfest releases. No blood and guts or maniac on the loose. Just a nice slow build in tension that reaches a very satisfying conclusion. I look forward to seeing it again.
3,Lake mungo,Not a bad movie . Different type of horror film . Has you wondering what will happen til the end. Give it a try like I did and I don't think you'll be disappointed .
1,Way too slow...boring,"The pace was extremely slow. There was no action at all. I kept waiting for the pace to pickup, but it never did.Two hours later: I'm still upset that I took the time to watch this movie. The plot summary sounded way better than the actual movie."
2,Lake Mungo,Not exactly what you would expect from an After Dark HorrorFest movie. I would not watch this again. It is very slow and uneventful. My time would be better spent mowing the yard.
1,Do not waste your time!,"Worst movie, kept waiting for something...anything to happen! Complete worthless piece of crap. Utter nonsense, I'm baffled by the other reviews. There is no way I'd ever recommend this to anyone I know, have known, or will ever know. P.S. I enjoy good movies, this isn't good... in any way."
1,Waste of time,"This film about a dead teenager is made in a boring and slow documentary-like style. I do not understand how this production could make the Horrorfest. It lacks horror characteristics; it is quite difficult to categorise, indeed. Overall - waste of time."
2,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"If you're a fan of PARANORMAL STATE and other such reality ghosthunter shows, this may appeal to you. While I can appreciate an attempt to try something not usually evident in the normally bloody Horrorfest entries, I just couldn't get into the faux-documentary.I didn't find it either scary or interesting especially with Alice's precognitive death visions. The actors are competent and convincing...I just found it dull and tedious."
3,Lake Mungo,"Although there are a few good scares in this film, the rest of it feels like scene after scene of dialogue with nothing interesting happening. In fact, much of the dialogue could have been edited out without the audience missing a thing.I do appreciate that the makers of the film tried to give the film an interesting, dense plot, but some of the plot elements seem unnecessary and/or confused. It seems they tried to do too much.The result is a horror movie without much horror. So sad."
1,Lake Mungo,"I'm an avid film watcher, but I can't stand when movies are made just to do it. This one had its moments but delivered nothing. I love most movies...definitely not this one."
2,Was there a mix up?,"I buy these films every time they are released...I had fallen behind on watching movies and chose this one as my first. I really don't understand how this movie became part of something associated with scary movies or anything called Horrorfest. This is shot documentary style. I kept watching and waiting for something to make it a horror film but nothing ever happens. There's a hint that it will turn out to be a murder mystery but that never really goes anywhere. There's a hint it is going to be a ghost story but that doesn't go anywhere either. The box art/DVD cover art shot is not even from the movie. I would have given this only one star but the story was okay I guess, it just isn't a horror film. I am still wondering if there was a mix up or something but no, the movie tells you what it is... I am disappointed and am not sure I will continue my collection if this is the path they are going to be taking."
2,documentry does not = horror,How the hell did this movie make it into the four set of Afterdark HorrorFest? The whole movie is done in documentry format. most of the video foottage from Alice's phone just sucks quality wise. this is nothingh more then a ghost story. Not one that I would have Like in Afterdark Horrorfest line up. The worst part of the movie is that you never fully get to see what happened to Alice. One of my least favorite in the series. I own all movies that pertain to Afterdark Horrorfest just to let you know.
2,"Good story, but not the best execution","Hmm... interesting story, and rather creepy as well... I'm not sure if the execution or style fit the story in the best way it could have been told, because it was rather flat and slow all the way through, but I do like the story."
3,Not Bad,The movie is definitely slow. However I think the twists make up for it.I wouldn't buy but didnt mind renting.
3,Not too shabby...,"This is a good movie if you are the type that can enjoy the ride even if the eventual destination may not be all you hoped. The filmmakers try to throw in some twists at the end: maybe one too many. The people I watched this with absolutely loved it, while I just liked it. However, I'm a jaded curmudgeon, so most viewers will not be disappointed."
2,Don't work well,"Nifty idea, it just doesn't work as advertised. I got a set of these at Target. They lit up easy enough in the store by smacking or violently swinging the package, but that's a far different motion than that of a smoothly rotating bike tire. There's no way they'll work on my kid's bike, even intermittently. I wasn't able to get them to light up spinning the wheel by hand. Older kids might be able to get them to work by jumping off curbs or hopping on their bikes, that's why I didn't give it 1 star."
3,"Can work, if...","Futzed around with the battery connections and the wiring and managed to get the lights to be sensitive enough to actually come on while riding my bike. Took some time, energy, and numerous tries to get them to work.Previous review:""Nope, doesn't work.""The lights require a real jolt to activate. Definitely of no use for someone riding a bicycle and or not interested in jumping curbs and riding over potholes to get his or her ""safety"" lights to work--and only for a handful of seconds.Possibly can be adjusted if you want...Good idea, poor execution."
3,Mediocre at best,These do not always light on my child's bike. Not much use for safety or visibility. Money poorly spent.
1,The end.,"This album made me very sad, because it is Not Very Good. One could even say that it is Quite Bad.The only song I liked even a little was the title track. The other stuff was derivative and sappy. Even their worst album (Box Office Bomb) wasn't this bad.I now rescind my dreams of this band getting back together. It's time to move on to pastures less stale, fellas."
4,Not perfect but pretty good.,The compiler has not axes to grind and seems to treat everyone reasonably and fairly.It is a bit weird to find Jimmy Jam under his first name (ditto L.A. Reid). It would also be a bit handier if mentions of folks who have entries were highlighted in some fashion when they are mentioned elsewhere.A few (doubtlessly accidental) omissions aside it is pretty comprehensive. I'd like to see more coverage of produces and entries discussing styles but of the books of this sort I've bought this is the most useful.
3,Great Reference Book,Book was required text for Ancient World class. It is well written and easy to use as a reference guide
5,This Work Roxx,"From the Bronze Age to the reign of Constantine, the Atlas of Classical History provides a comprehensive series of maps, diagrams, and commentary designed to meet the needs of classical scholars, as well as general readers. Over 135 maps of the Greek and Roman worlds clearly mark the political affiliations of the cities and states, major military events, trade routes, artistic, cultural and industrial centers, and colonization and exploration."
3,Rib rack slight disappointment.,I have used this rib rack in my gas grill twice now and I am not pleased with the performance it delivered. The rack has discolored and will not clean up as promised. The ribs need to be cut into smaller sections as a full rack of ribs will not balance well in the rack. It is difficult to pickup from the grill as the sections on the end do not lend themselves to be gripped easily.
5,Good choice,This was a gift for my husband and he is really happy with it. It seems to be sturdy and will accomplish everything he needs it to.
4,Works!,This was the perfect size for my smoker and it greatly expanded the number of ribs I can do at one time. Well worth it.
2,Waste,Sorry to say it but...this is not needed to cook good ribs. I got it to use on my webber but I never used it to cook my ribs. Now I have a large smoker and will never need this. But that's just what I have to say about it. It is still a nice product.
2,not what I expected,"Since we live in an area that has inclement weather a good deal of the time, I purchased this hoping it would help me with the poor reception or lack of reception that we had with our satellite dish. Unfortunately it did not, so we had to give up our dish and go back to cable TV. We liked the dish but it did not suit our needs and the cover did not help in the least."
1,Bad mixing old and new music instruments,"If you are expecting an authentic Vietnamese traditional music, this CD is not a right one for you. Ten out of 20 songs (2, 4, 7, 10 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 20) are playing by the Western guitar, not the Vietnamese traditional music instruments. This constraint ""marriage"" is very unpleasant to listen to."
1,Dupplication CD........,"Be carefull..... this CD is a dupplication of 2 other CDs with different titles, they are: ""Vietnam - Toutes Les Musique Du Monde"" and ""Traditional Music From Vietnam""."
2,Unclear,"I used this text as a student while at the University of Auckland.At times I found the text woefully unclear. For instance, from pages 68 through 83, the authors delve into a brief excursus on the philosophy of language and a theory of reference. Their explication of the causal-historical theory is unclear at best, and seems to delve too quickly into the pros and cons of the theory without first explaining it in any depth.At other points I found myself going back over sections of text 4 and 5 times before I finally latched onto the concept at hand, even then it was with the aid of articles on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.In sum, I do not recommend this text. Jaegwon Kim's text book aptly titled ""Philosophy of Mind"" is *MUCH* better."
1,Very poorly written,"I first used this book as an undergraduate. I found the text very poorly written: it is both horribly unclear and badly organized. Later, I had to use the book as a teaching assistant for a philosophy of mind course. My initial impression has only been reconfirmed. My students had great difficulty following the book, and relied largely on lectures for understanding. Even I had to read portions several times for understanding, if only because the authors' writing style is so graceless and clunky.In short: not recommended for students, or for teachers. Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson are horrible writers. After some work from a talented non-philosopher editor, maybe this book would be worth a look."
1,lame again!,Lame cd - I got ripped off on their other cd too! I am not happy about this at all. this is no good!
4,No Wave Legends Collected,"Along with DNA, Teenage Jesus & the Jerks, and the Contortions, Mars were the pioneering No Wave folks featured on the legendary 1978 Eno-produced lp ""No New York."" Four of the tracks on 78 Reissue appeared on NNY (Helen Forsdale, Tunnell, Hairwaves, PR Ghost). The music is a wonderful scramble of new wave, Branca-esque noise and free jazz. Incendiary, exciting, unforgettable."
1,Not Worth It,I got this book to study for the PRAXIS II and it was bad it has alot of incorrect answers in it and it is completely out of date i would not recomend it to anyone who wants to pass.
2,"Weak - But, should've been good 7 years ago","The book starts fairly well but get lost after some pages. It focus a lot on tests - hey! TDD is great but it shouldn't have so much focus on a design patterns book.Throughout the book you'll find lots of hackish PHP4 examples -which are useless now- and lots of badly written PHP5 examples (maybe because PHP5 were just beginning back then).As I stated on the title, this book should've been good 7 years ago, but for now, it's outdated.I really don't recommend this book if you understand at least 2 or 3 Design Patterns, or if you are serious about PHP OO programming."
1,This book is not about Design Patterns,"From the offset, you are informed that this entire book is based on a test-writing then code-developing method of development that requires the implementation of an outside library of code. The link in the book referencing this library (called simpletest) doesn't even take you to a download page for this library (I had to find it) and the methods in the library are not explained which is a prerequisite to understanding the implementation of the design patterns. Wait...I didn't buy this book to learn about ""simpletest"", I bought this book to learn about design patterns. The misguided attempt of the author to railroad you into his method of coding results in the complete obscurification of the design patterns which are a heady enough subject. What a blunder."
3,Beware,"Picture and description is for full height cardSent me a 1/2 height card without adapter, needed a full height(Compatible with x4, x8, and x16 full-height PCI Express slots)(The second picture shows a 1/2 height card)"
1,"Wrong Item,","Wrong Item , too long for this mower though you say it fits Murry 42"" mowers. Thank you. Robert Hudson"
1,Scales should be easy to use,I bought this scale a little over a year ago. It never gives the same reading twice and recently it has given a 2 - 7 lb reading difference in a matter of seconds. Most of the time it read E (error) and even though I've changed the battery I can only weigh myself on occasion when it works. I'm going to buy something else.
1,hate it,I had this. It worked for a month. I only used it 4-5 times then it broke. It just stopped working. its not worth the money or time.
4,It's isn't above or below any other scale in this price range,"The scale platform is small. I wear size 9 in female shoes and I can just fit my feet onto the scale. Your weight can change in a matter of seconds but so far I've only notice a 0.4lb difference at most. Basically it's not a high tech expensive scale but I like it because it wasn't expensive, it is reasonably accurate and it gets the job done. I have bought scales that cost a bit more and have the same drawbacks (small platform with slightly fluctuating readings). If you're not going to spend more than $30 for a scale I doubt you will find something much better because This seems like the standard for this price range. However, My advise is If you have larger feet find a larger platform."
1,Find another scale,"We've had this scale for a few months now and we're shopping for a new one. I guess the old ""you get what you pay for"" applies in this case. The readings fluctuate every time we get on it. We often get on the scale 3 times and take the average of the 3 readings. And because we can't trust the weight readings, we never use the BMI function either. It's a small scale and would probably be ok for someone who only weighed occasionally. But if you're monitoring your weight on a regular basis, don't buy this one."
3,the best part is the cd,"i found the book to be good, but the things spoken about where at least, for me, obvious...things i already knew about stress and how to eliminate it; but, the cd which comes with the book makes the book worth buying"
2,Why in Kindle format?,"I was lucky enough to be able to meet Dr. Weiss and attend his workshop at a conference in San Francisco many years ago. His books changed my life and were a great inspiration at a time when I needed it. As a new Kindle owner, I decided I might want to get some of his books to have on my kindle. But after reading the reviews, I wonder, WHY would this be offered on the Kindle? I have another of his CDs that has been very useful to me. With the CD being such an integral part of what this book has to offer, the Kindle just does not seem the best way to experience it. Just because something is offered in the Kindle format does not mean that is the best format to purchase. If I decide to buy this, it will be the HB form, new, with an intact CD, and not the Kindle version. Amazon should make it clear when they offer a product like this that it is not the same as the HB version. And, we as consumers need to research and think carefully before we purchase."
2,Careful on Kindle,"No CD with this makes for a very brief and simple read, with much of the book referring to the contents of a CD that is not available with the e-book."
4,Three out of three gerbils approve...,"This brand was recommended by someone on a forum, so I bought a couple bags. As far as gerbil response, I don't see much of a difference, but you can tell by looking at it that this mix is heartier and more varied than the major brands you can pick up at the drugstore. There's less dust and more big chunks. But whatever the black pellets are, my gerbils don't consider them food unless they're really desperate. I guess we all have our preferences."
2,disappointing,"Beginners book. Not one to build a repetoire. Few songs of the real Blues Masters.Most are compositions by the author ""in the style of"" some of the Masters. Too bad."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Unlike the other reviewer, who is clearly a fan of Mr. Dunphy's writing, I found this novel (not memoir) tedious and unreadable. Like most readers, I was hoping for a glimpse into the private life of Capote and his long time companion and what their special bond was. Instead, almost the entire book is about a fictitious Father Synge, who is struggling with his faith and his homosexuality. Even on that level, it fails as good storytelling; Dunphy's faux-literary style is simply third-rate and his ""story"" (don't expect plot) is interminable. A straightforward memoir would have worked so much better, but after reading this, I think Dunphy has neither the writing chops nor the courage to tell a straightforward and honest account of his relationship with Truman. Bottom line: this is NOT a memoir of Jack Dunphy's life with Truman Capote."
1,Disappointed,"I love puzzle games, and was looking forward to many hours of cerebral challenges. I was sorely disappointed. The directions are hard to read and the graphics are way too small to be enjoyable. In addition, the controls could be more user-friendly. For example, if you enjoy the Sudoku puzzles in Brain Age and are looking for more of the same, you too will be disappointed in the graphics and controls. I love the portability and user-interface of the Nintendo DS. I currently have 18 games, and this is the only one I wish I had not purchased."
4,An amazing break through,"Swans power has never lied in their lyrics. Quite frankly, I find the band to be lyrically deficient. The power of Swans lies in their innovative sound. Soundtracks from the blind wavers between intoxicating and devastating. In the Sound, Michael Gira seems to be trying to communicate all of those ideas that have never worked well in words. Helpless Child, a fifeen minute long opus, turns midway from a simple song into a loud opressive journey through sound. Swans have finally made an album that breaks all of the standards."
3,A little disappointed,"I love the SWANS, but this album fell a little short for me. The ""music"" does not serve as an adequate backdrop for the vocals. It's as if they grabbed a microphone and just recorded what they said with an available track of noise. I'd recommend you skip this one in favor of ""Great Annihilator""."
1,I can't believe I bought it...,"I am a little stunned remembering the lyrical reviews that prompted me to buy this!It is incredible drivel! Noisy, incoherent, self-indulgent incredible drivel. It might have some value for scaring raccoons and other vermin out of one's attic, but I have a vermin-free attic, so this racket is of no use to me.I hope the people who made it at least did so with a cynical reliance on the power of hype and human folly, which sells an awful lot of stuff these days. If they took themselves seriously, somehow, that makes it worse."
5,"Great product, amazing results","This is so far best diet product on the market. real pure hoodia gordonii, Ive been using it for a year now, LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!after reaching my weight loss goal I am still using it to stay away from junkie, helps great! Hoodoba is my #1 diet product. You have to try it to believe it."
5,An important ingredient in anyone's communication arsenal,"From A to Z, Mr. Zera provides poignant quotes to assist the business person in effectively communicating their message. All too often, the average business communicator over uses the same dry humor and personal stories to try to relate their perspective to the audience, even if the stories are somewhat off topic.Mr. Zera offers a refreshing library of wit and wisdom from well known personalities such as President Franklin Roosevelt to Baseball's hall of fame, Reggie Jackson. Whether your topic deals with Adversity, Character, Diplomacy or Geography, Mr. Zera has provided a well to delve into for inspiration and support of your idea.As quoted from Business Wit and Wisdom, ""People are more willing to accept your ideas if you tell them Benjamin Franklin said them first."""
3,Sagwan,"*** no english sub-titles ***quality and film is good would have given 4 stars if sub-titled.director / producer missed quite a few opportunites to make this film really great.seems a lot of actors are still scqueamish about nudity. they don't need to castactors that won't do what needed to advance the film.just look at COCO MARTIN's last 2 films, he played the parts as they needed tobe done."
2,Not impressed,"For all of the great reviews, I was expecting an extreme workout. I was disappointed in this DVD. There were some new moves, but just an ok workout overall."
5,Love this,I just bought all three swat workouts. I love them. They are motivating and not annoying. I like the countdown on the screen and he tells what is coming next.I wish there were more of these workouts.
3,Its the classics,"This product gets delivered fast, I have only done it about three times. I think it's a good workout, it makes you break a good sweat. But it's the same classic workouts you would do in your P.E. Class in elementary. Don't get me wrong this is a good workout, but it does get a little boring after a while. I don't love the music, and he introduces you to all the girls one by one. lol Its good motivation, because they have great bodies, but I think it's funny when he says these are real woman just like you lol. I had to mute it and use my headphones and I-pod. The six min abs are great, they made me sore. It's a long workout if you do the entire thing, you can always break it up though."
2,How Boring is This??,"If you're used to Cathe, Amy, Kelly and the like, you will find this incredibly boring. The same cycle is repeated four times with the same old exercises. The music is lame and the workout not challenging enough. Then there is a strange and cheesy interlude with football/soccer feet where all the girls circle around the male instructor cheering, eww! Too much marching and talking during which I had to jog and jump to get something out of it. It's missing creativity and fun, but it reminded me a little of Jillian Michaels' workouts, so if you like those, you will probably like this too, just not for me. However, I do like the other two SWAT workouts which are pretty good."
5,SWAT MAKES ME SWEAT!,"Love the easy to follow routine and Captain Tom is cute! I really sweatwhen I do the whole dvd. However, I feel like a dork when havingto do the ""Swat March"". It's just marching in place while swinging yourelbows. I hate marching in place! "" )"
5,Amazing Total Body Work Out!!!!,This Workout is amazing! I lift weights 3 times a week and cardio 2-3 a week. As you all know the cardio can become a little mundane. I was looking for something that was fun and did not make the carido workout feel like the same old thing. To be honest it kicked my butt the first month or two but that is exactly what I needed. This Workout works all of your muscles and then some. The best part is that its not boring! Commander Tom really makes it fun and upbeat and before you know it you just had one of the best cardio workouts you have ever had! This is the cardio routine that I actually look forward to every week and to top it off it probably burns the most calories than any of the others I do. I can not say enough about the routine and Commander Tom!
5,Amazing results from a great guy!,"Tom is the best fitness instructor that I have ever had. He is different from that drill sergeant type and more like a guy that you would hang out with. His corny jokes and encouragement really help you get away from just working out and help you focus on why you are doing the exercises you are doing. You do SWAT workout to have a better all around life outside the gym and that is what happens. In just a few weeks, you will begin to feel results and have a workout plan for a long time. Thanks to Commander Tom!"
4,A different kind of workout!,My favorite kind of workout is a bootcamp workout so this was right up my alley! It's definitely different than any of my other workout DVD's. Tom is very motivating and the workout flies by. I do wish it was a longer workout and I also wish that he did some of the moves longer to the point of muscle fatigue.
2,Disappointed,"Well this DVD isn't horrible, but I probably won't be using it.My first gripe is the instructor and the background girls. It's a bit cheesy and distracting to see a room full of women in matching short shorts bouncing around. I've never felt this way about any other workout DVD. The girls seemed like they were hired directly from Hooters or something.My second gripe are the moves. I was in the military for four years, so I guess I am just used to these moves and find them quite boring. Pushups, I mean I've done hundreds upon hundreds of them. This seems like a quick routine I would do in the morning with my unit. I guess that's what some people are looking for, but it's not for me.Good luck! Oh, and I recommend Self Bikini Ready Fast."
2,I am not impressed,"With a name like SWAT Workout and Extreme Weight Loss, I was expecting something harder. Don't get me wrong, it was a decent workout and the instructor is great. I was just expecting something much harder - espcially with all the good reviews. I'm thankful that I rented this from Netflix before I bought it. I found that the workout wasn't very intense and there was too much recovery time for me to feel like I did much good. This one is OK but I'll be searching for more high intensity workouts. I want one that whips my behind and this one wasn't it."
5,SWAT-WORK PROGRAM IS THE BEST!,"This is BEST total workout ever. I've tried Power90, Beach body, Tae-Bo....but there is something about this workout that beats the other programs hands down...It's so addictive in positive way. I love what it has done to for my body. I was in good shape before...But now, in great shape! What I like most is that you get a total body workout...every muscle in your body in the shortest amount of time. A plus for busy lives! This is a must buy...You will absolutely love the program!!! Any workout programs that Commander Tom produces, you should definitely purchase...you will be so glad you did!Commander Tom is the BEST!!!"
4,It is a great story,It is a great story becose they alway have a great feeling to them and the story about puppys is great but it is hard to bleive that 202 dogs are missing but still it is a great book if you love puppys then you will love this book!! and mary kate and ashely are great dectives on this case they never give up and if you love them then you will love this story and in this stary there is a lot of mystey in this book so you will love it and it has a lot of deteals ans you should never give up if you are on a case!!!Bey
5,noplacelikehome2008,"This book was recommended to me for reference and follow-up reading by a college instructor in a master's level counseling course. I am still reading other required texts so I do not have a personal opinion yet. However, it arrived on time and in excellent condition. Thank you, very much."
5,Good Book!,"When the Road Ends is about twelve-year-old Mary Jack, who is a foster child. Then her foster parents send her to live in a cabin with their other two foster children (one of them doesn't talk) and Father Matt's sick sister. This book was excellent!"
4,"When the Road Ends is a great book, but boring at times.","If you like books that are not too long, then When the Road Ends is the book for you. The bad part about this book is it drags in a couple of spots. At the end though they really keep you hooked on the book by a whole bunch of problems happening. I have only read this book once and I already want to read it again. When the Road Ends really made me realize all the pain and suffering that foster children go through, moving from foster home to foster home. This is a great book and I would recommend When the Road Ends to anyone!"
2,Bad recording quality,"I bought this a week ago. I have never heard such bad recordings before. The first CD is the worst. There are loud scratching sounds, some songs are extremely hard to hear. Other CDs are better, but none are top quality. Great selection, but the poor recording quality makes it difficult to ""lose yourself"" in the music."
2,Poor Quality,"I had this game now for one year. Six month after the start button fell off, and never was I able to use the game. It is not much fun, not to be able to keep score. Then all the bakets nets broke off. I have not been able to find any place to fix this game."
1,Disgusting!!!!,"Amazon.....You need to review this book you are selling! This book deals with dog fighting and the horrible ways in which dogs are killed for the pure pleasure of illiterate scum.I would personally like to confront Ed Faron re: this disgusting book. In this day and age, I simply cannot believe that anyone would purchase such pure filth. In addition, I cannot believe that Amazon would sell such trash!!!Please, please review this and take it off your website. No one could possibly benefit from a book like this and I am ashamed for Amazon for even offering such vile content.So you a aware, I will be forwarding this to all media outlets in hopes of bringing public awareness to this horrible material. As a past Police K-9 Unit Commander, I will do my utmost to destroy this type of animalistic treatment of dogs everywhere. In addition, this book was written by a convicted felon."
5,Beautiful book on Camellias,"This is a great reference on Camellias. It tells you all about the different types and their bloom times. Best of all, it has tons of pictures - all close up of a bloom so you know exactly what each camellia looks like. An essential resource for anyone wanting to research what camellias to purchase."
2,I just don't reach for this much,"This was my first vegetarian cookbook so I have had it for about 6 years now. There's probably a couple hundred recipes from appetizers to beverages, but most of the ingredients are just not practicle so I barely prepare anything from this book. I also find many of the recipes to be more of the same w/ maybe just slightly different spices.I won't get rid of it as there are about 5 recipes I do make that I really like, but this is really a wasted book considering how many recipes there are and how many are basically useless."
3,Did She Really Make All These Recipes?,"I try to write a date and note next to each recipe the first time I make it, and looking through my book, I see that even some of the ""spicier"" dishes (a potato curry, for example) were enjoyed by everyone in my family---even my ten-year-old son! There are many interesting and innovative recipes in this cookbook, but I've sometimes gotten the impression that the author didn't make all the recipes herself. A couple of times (sorry I can't find the specific recipes), she seemed to leave out important steps or not mention something significant that one should watch out for. I do remember something that when baked, fell apart because it stuck to the pan. There was no instruction to grease or otherwise prepare the pan to prevent this. Anyway, I would say this is overall a good cookbook, but I am a little leery to make new recipes now, since I'm not sure all the necessary steps will be included."
4,Something between ordinary cooking and fancy cooking.,"I really enjoy this book. The recipes are tasty, and ranked by difficulty. (One star is the easiest). The chapters are well organized and there is a photo for almost every recipe. Chapters include headings like ""pastas, stews, desserts, appetizers, etc). There is little room in the margins though, for notes. There is a little bit in the front about nutrition and what to look for in a vegetarian diet. Each chapter also has a ""feature"" layout with some extra recipes that are organized by theme -- either an ingredient or a category like ""dips."" There is no nutritional info and the recipes are not labelled L, O, L/O or V so you will have to figure that on your own rather than at a glance.I haven't had any trouble making these, and they yield tasty results. I collect cookbooks, and this is among my top 5 to turn to when I need ideas. It's pretty enough to make a great gift, but practical enough to actually be USED."
5,One of the best,This cookbook is easy to use and the food is great. I really like that each recipe has a preparation time and a total cooking time so you know what kind of time commitment to expect. The pictures are helpful to get an idea of what the dish is supposed to look like. The other nice aspect of this cookbook is that most ingredients are easy to find and the spices are common enough that you would probably have them in the house.
5,a definite hit!,"in the hit and miss world of (vegetarian) cookbooks, this is a hit, and highly recommended. the recipes range from the common to the mildly exotic, and should provide stimulating recipes for vegetarians and omnivores alike. the book is beautifully photographed, and just paging through it is an inspiration for even the most unwilling cooks. recipes also give an idea of the time involved in their creation, from cutting board to tabletop. instructions are given in metric measurements as well."
4,Great Gift for a 4 year old - Big Hit,I gave this as a gift to my 4 yr old niece. It was a huge hit with both her and her parents. They live in a small apartment and I am always concerned about toys with small pieces and storage ease. I will agree with the other reviews - the case is very cheap and poorly made...makes it tough to keep things neat and tidy. We ended up putting the Polly stuff in a zip lock bag and tossed the plastic case out. The dolls have proven to be a wonderful toy for her and her play dates alike. It is a great gift to consider if your recipient is pressed for storage space.
4,"I agree with the lid problem, but is a very cute toy",My daughter got this set for Christmas this year and she loves it. The outfits are very cute and my daughter can easily change the outfits on the little dolls. I do agree with the last review that the lid could be made better. It would be nice if it closed tighter and it has already fallen off several times in the last 3 days. Overall it is a good toy and my daughter has really enjoyed the outfits and accessories.
3,Great product but slow delivery. Customs problems at UK!!!,"The product quality is excellent but the delivery was slow. Besides, the UK customers have a very serious problem as the HR Customs & Excises is extremely hard now with the taxes so finally we paid a lot for the products from USA."
2,Too experimental for me.,"I really like Buckethead. But i don't like this album. I find that it is perhaps too experimental for me (except for Nottingham Lace, which is beautiful). I think part of the problem is I don't really like the music of the people he is teaming up with. They are all great artists, but their experimentations are waaay out there."
5,Have no fear. The greatest guitar player alive is here,"To say that this album is nothing like anything Buckethead has released before is quite a statement, considering the depth and bredth of his portfolio. But it's true!! This album has 11 songs and they are all very different. Some are even suitable for radio (something Buckethead has never enjoyed). If you don't want to hear something departed from classic Buckethead, have no fear. A NEW new album comes out in less than a month"
2,stick to instrumental,"buckethead is the greatest guiarist who ever lived and doesn't get the credit, but this is an absolutly terrible album. I liked Nottingham Lace and the hand and i liked We are one, but the rest was either screamy or boring.(however the interlude was pretty funny). this was my first buckethead album, because i just picked a random cd and bought it (RLY STUPID IDEA) If u dont actualy like buckethead and you absolutly had to get an album of his get this, but if you like the instrumentals then get something else and download nottingham lace. Don't let this be your first album because a person who truly appreciates guitar would be automaticly turned off."
3,"Ugly guy, Good Guitairman.",I listened to the album front to back on my way to work today and I think it's pretty good. I don't however like the order the tracks are in. It kind of starts heavy then goes mellow then back to heavy after the interlude. It's kind of strange how they arranged ther tracks. I realy like track 7 and the guitair work on 11 is great too. If you like System of a down then you will like this album mainly because it features the lead singer but he kind of sounds a little different than he does in SOAD but still able to recignize his voice. You can definately pickup a few bits that sound very Guns N' Roses / Slash soloish.I'm interested to know while he's releasing his own album when will Chinese Democracy finally come out?Anyway Worth a listen to.. It's not the best album i've ever heared but by far not the worst.
3,Regular guy,"I give a regular guy perspective. It's not very good. Did you ever think you could have bought something else better for the same money? Well I did.Like I don't even have the complete AC DC collection and I bought this. I think it was the bucket and mask Hype that made the decision. And I'm not going to write you pages of artists that would make a better selection than this,Van halen. The only people I think who will enjoy this CD are cult, so I'll leave it up to them to give it all the rave rating I gave my rant."
3,Not as strong as you'd hope,"Any fan of CSI will like this series of novels, but with this one, you will be a little dissapointed. The last couple of novels were very strong, but this one puts the plot on the backburner and works more on character development. The way Collins describes the characters, their thoughts, and their attitudes is dead-on with the characters we've grown to love from the show. The plot, about two seemingly unrelated murders, is nothing innovative or ground breaking, but is very indicative of what you see on the show. The only problem I have is that the show CSI is about forensic detective work and it seems as though the forensics aren't in play all that much in this novel.The plot is very by the numbers and I'm sure by the end of the book most people will have figured out who did it. Check it out if you're a CSI fan, but if this is your first CSI novel, you may want to go back and read Binding Ties instead."
3,Original Characters,"While I enjoyed it, I thought that Max Allan Collins once again put too much emphasis on his original characters. Why not use the characters (like the lab techs) that exist in the CSI universe instead of creating new ones like the computer genius he's so enamoured with?"
1,Fools,"Oh yeah. Title IX is that statute that governs women in sports, right? And one (ok, not Gavora, but someone) may make an arguable case that Title IX creates some marginal anomalies in connection with that jugular issue to Western Civilization - collegiate sports. Hence, Title IX is a failed experiment in public policy and must go. Of course you believe this because it says so right hear in this book by a Bush administration amateur flack, and this is what your read, or sort of read or heard about, which is more than sufficient to start you marching ever rightward with little mezmerized spirals revolving in your eyes. One problem. Title IX deals with equal opportunity in EDUCATION. College sports at best is a pimple on the butt of Title IX. So if we clear up that pimple Gavora would no longer be excessively vexed? Well, not exactly. All of Title IX has to be ashcanned, of course. You have to be a real piece of Samsonite not to recognize what this toiletworthy book is really about."
1,Way off base...Gavora misses facts,"In this book, Gavora continues to perpetuate the myth that Title IX is responsible for the elimination of men's sports. Nevermind the fact that nowhere in Title IX does it say cut men's teams and create women's teams. However, that is what Gavora insinuates which is just wrong. It is administrators (mostly men) who make the decision to eliminate sports, a small fact which Gavora overlooks. Overall, this book was filled with inacuracies and I would not recommend it."
1,EGADS!!!,"As a professional educator, and in the opinion of the author, clearly an enemy since I work in a public university (and she clearly is no fan of public education, believing only the rich and the male should be educated), I am appalled with the lack of understanding of the programs ignorantly discussed in the book. The ""work"", clearly a poor attempt as intellectualism (as put out by the superficial 150 page tome) is little more than partisan banter which is of no use to the average American, rather a Unibomber-type rage against the public education she so so despises."
1,Dangerously Slanted,"This book is hateful and dangerous. It calls for reducing educational opportunities for women based on -- I kid you not -- supposed differences in male and female patterns of cognitive abilities and brain structure and function. What's next? Similar distinctions based on race or national origin? Such warped thinking is shocking. Unlike others, I have a hard time dismissing this book as comicly slanted. Rather, it's downright dangerous that this invincibly ignorant writer tries to provide a roadmap to convert her miserable offal into public policy."
2,A book that might smite a straw man,"Ah yes. Govora is some modern Belleronphon, athwart a twentieth-century Pegasus (the Ashcroft Justice Department), who will slay Title IX before it devours our culture whole in its filthy, putrescent, purulent maw. NOT! But - what the heck - I give it an extra star as a fantastic egotistical fictionalization that, at turns, is good for a chuckle."
1,Public Policy From Wrestling Coaches,Those who follow Title 9 issues will recognize immediately that this book does nothing more than accept without question the views advanced by the National Wrestling Coaches Association. It is rather amusing that right wing editorialists and elements within the Bush administration (Gavora herself has a political job at the Justice Department) take their queues from this group of progressive deep thinkers. Stop right now and recall the wrestling coach at your school. Enough said.
1,Fringe Politics,"As much as Govora may long to regress to the 1950s, it's simply not going to happen. According to a Wall Street Journal (yes, the Wall Street Journal, not the Nation or Mother Jones magazine) poll, 79 percent of adults polled across the United States approve of Title IX, while only 14 percent disapprove. When asked whether or not they approved to cutting back on resources for men's athletic programs to invest in women's programs, therefore making programs more equal, 76 percent of those polled approved of the cuts, while only 19 percent disapproved. (NBC News/Wall Street Journal; June 2000). Separately, Gavora's theories of Title IX have failed utterly and repeatedly in the courts. This book is the very difinition of fringe politics -- facts, law, overwhelming popular opinion be damned."
5,An important work,"This is an important work on an important topic--equality. Title IX, the revered Title IX, is the subject of many propagandistic television shows and magazine articles, but it's not really the subject of much thought. Until now. This work changes that, and makes one examine the meaning of gender equality in our modern world: Does equality really mean strict quotas? Does it really require harming men to make sure women have a chance? Open your mind and try this one."
5,S.P.O.C.K at their BEST!,"This is the way S.P.O.C.K should be heard, live with a shouting and raving crowd around. Even still, this album doesn't really gove you the whole and complete S.P.O.C.K live experience, only seeing them for real can do that.The CD has all of the greastest hits from the first 3 albums and is a monument over the Plasteroid and Cpt. Eddie B. Kirk who left the band after the Earth Orbit Live Tour to concentrate on their other projects, mostly notable is Eddies PAGE whos early 80:s hit ""Dansande Man"" still is one of the REAL classics of the Swedish synthschene...Back to S.P.O.C.K...The only bad thing is that some versions is almost to close to the album versions and, we don't get any talk between the songs, but then again, it was recorded at two gigs in Sweden and I don't think the rest of the world is so intrested in Swedish;)The best introduction to S.P.O.C.K. GET IT!"
4,my aspies first bible,"I chose this particular bible style because my youngest; who has aspergers, needed something visually stimulating and demonstrative. This bible did the trick. He reads his verses (at bible study), then he reads the issues, facts and commentaries which makes it easier for him to grasp the concepts (in his own way) and apply the applications in a manner that is appropriate to and for him. Very pleased."
5,good,Good service. Fast delivery. Very happy. The teen study bible was exactly as described and how I expected. The purchase was for my daughter and she is happy.
4,A great book for those who are interested in God's word!,"This is an incerdible for book for teens. Being a teen as I am, this book has helped answer many questions about faith, God and Christian life. Not only does it have the bible written in an easy-to-understand format, but it also has a useful index- that lists problems in our society today and what the bible says about them- along with many other things. I highly reccomend it."
4,Teens can relate,"I bought this for my sister who just turned 13. She really likes the commentary, she can relate to it and understand it better."
5,It was the best Bible I have ever have found!,"I am 15 and I have been trying to find a Bible that would help me understand God more. The other Bibles were so jibberish I couldn't stand reading them. I can't read something that I don't understand. If you are looking for a Bible, I highly recommend this Bible."
4,"Easy to understand, pretty good translation for teens","I got this Bible for Confirmation, and it works really well for that. Bible Promises Highlights verses worth remembering, The Bible Says gives a Biblical perpective on todays life, Direct Line takes Bible passages and answers the question How does his relate to me, Jericho Joe shows up every now and then to provide a lighthearted tough, and the quizer asks ind gives answers to interesting Bible trivia. All in all I really like this Bible, but it seems to be missing something I just can't put a finger on."
5,An almost Teen's Review :),"I got this bible after my older brother got a new one. I thought it would be good to use this for a christian summer camp I go to. As usual I was completely correct! This bible included tons of lessons helpful to understanding God's word.There was one little catch. Before long I found a few more mature topics in the lessons. Of course I survived, but remember I would not recomend this bible for kids under 13. Remember this is a TEEN study bible."
5,"If you are trully interested in learnig about God,read this",This Bible is the greatest book for teens that ever was written. It looks at your point of view. It undersatand how tough life is for teens. It can help answer many of your problems so open it up and read. It also has great everyday questions and answers we teens ask. It is so fulfilling. The Lord wants you so come to him.
5,The Teen Study Bible is great,This is a great Study Bible for Teens. It makes it easier to understand what the Bible is talking about in certain parts. This is great for anyone and there really isn't much you can say about it other than that.
1,Don't Buy It!,"The notes in this Bible make the text of Scripture out to be man centered rather than God centered. The writers make false assertions in order to dismiss Scriptural passages. For example, see 1 Cor. 11:6-10. They assert ""Paul was writing about some women who were being a distraction in worship services."" This is a madeup lie. There is absolutely no proof of this.To makeup lies in order to dismiss a Scriptural passage is anabomination."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I bought this book with a beaded bag design in mind that I wanted to make. I was hoping that the book would help tell me how to put my vision into reality, but no such luck. What I had in mind doesn't exist in the book, so I'm back where I started. There's some nice stuff in here, just what I had in mind."
3,Beaded handbags,This book has nice beaded bags in it. The bags are mostly large bags for adults. I was looking for smaller bags for dolls. The book didn't have any. Overall though a nice book.
5,I hope we see much more of Brian McComas!,This CD is amazing. I am pretty hard-core country traditionalist and found this to be the perfect blend of traditional country and updated appeal.Brian McComas is an amazing new talent. Hope we see much more from him!
5,Delightful,"Nancy Lemann's Malaise is a wonderful novel--witty, clever and delightfully snide at times. Lemann has a marvelous, unique approach to storytelling which may turn off some readers, but I really enjoyed it. Reading this novel is like spending time with an old friend with a rapier sharp sarcastic wit. In terms of plotting here, not much happens, but for a novel of about 250 pages, that is OK. Fleming Ford, the narrator, is a 40-year old Southerner living in Esperanza California who becomes a bit obsessed with an older widower she knows from New York. Her out-of-place-ness enables her to observe all around her with a deadpan aloofness that is always funny and at times hilarious. This is a terrific novel and one I highly recommend if you a looking for a brief little sarcastic interlude."
5,A Must Read!,"Finally a book written by a real doctor with real advise and solutions, for real people who are in real pain! A great book that is good for both patients and doctors."
5,Quality Product!,"This car cassette adapter will work with anything that has a headphone jack. The cord is really long which to me seems unnecessary but I would rather have it be too long than too short. It does exactly what I expected and has worked for several months with no issues!! I am not disappointed with this product.** As noted by the other reviewers, the jack is L-shaped not straight. This did not affect me. Although it is a bit fuzzy that is what you get with any cassette adapter. I didn't expect it to sound amazing and it doesn't. However, it does play my iPod through the speakers and I do enjoy listening to it and not paying the extra for a transmitter."
2,Poor quality,"You get what you pay for, eh? This item is poor quality and I recommend against purchasing it. The jack connection is not tight and sometimes gives only the left or right channel. The cassette part doesn't always sit right in the car stereo and can cause poor sound, too.2 stars. It would be 1 but the price is so cheap.UPDATE: The sound was so bad I had to buy a replacement. The cassette doesn't sit well in the player and required my finger to adjust it in order to get mediocre sound. I bought a Philips version and like it much better."
1,It is not the one on the picture!,"I bought for my Iphone 4.I use the bumper case.To use this type of products, you have to take off the bumber case. and it is kind of annoying.I bought this because this product has a straight connection so I do not need to take off the bumper case.But the one I received has L shaped end!If you are using Iphones with cases, do not buy this one."
1,Too generic not specific to SAP,This book is more geared to an executive that is fairly new to Information Technology. Much of the information & challenges outlined in this book is generic to the implementation of any large scale technology and not just SAP
4,Good anthology,"A good anthology of mountaineering and rock climbing writing. Nothing gripping, but interesting none-the-less. Confirms stories written by others, John Long for example. It's good to hear all sides of a story."
2,don't really like it,"Just based on the non-pc title, instead of ""Native American,"" this 1990 book seems quite out-dated. Look at the front cover: do those 2 figures look authentic? Do the colors on the pillow ring true? What the heck are the letters in the Cherokee Alphabet on the back cover? You can't make them out from the picture or from the chart. I've been to many pow-wows, have native American friends, and many books on native lore, costumes and the like. This book just does not seem authentic. For better cross-stitching, check out the following:Joan Elliott's Native American Cross StitchNative American Cross Stitch"
4,Politics and Headaches,"This book contains a lot of facts about civil rights and paints a great picture of where Mr. Barry first started his political career. It's a tough read because it is a mixture of facts, conversations, and deception."
5,The Best!,"This is the best introductory ESL text I've ever used. Well organized, well written, comprehensive. I recommend it to all teachers in the US and elsewhere."
4,Fascinating,"Kingwell's book is a very interesting exploration of the nature of happiness. He explores a wide variety of theories from different philosophers, as well as some pyschologists. Ultimately, he concludes that Aristotle's definition is best. Aristotle has always confused me, and Kingwell is the first author who has ever explained him in a way that made sense to me.The author's writing style is clear and concise. He has a good sense of humor, and I liked the way he tied popular culture, philosophy, and personal examples together. The book wasn't dry, dull and boring, the way philosphy can be at times.There is only one reason that I can't give the book five stars. I found that Kingwell rambled a bit, and he lost track of his point. Overall, however, I think the book is really worthwhile, and I would encourage anyone who is interested in philosophy to pick up a copy of the book."
4,Happiness is a warm gun and a read of this book,"Fascinating examination of how notions of happiness have been considered, from Dr Johnson to Jeremy Bentham, Hobbes, Charles de Gaulle and more. Kingwell looks at the New Age movement and perceived virtues of happiness, with a strange and probably unnecessary diversion into self-medicating with Prozac."
3,Reading and Writing Music,Very basic note reading exercises for both treble and bass clefs. Not much for the older grades.
3,just ok,"This is much smaller than I had imagined. Didn't really think it was worth the money, but my daughter did like it."
2,Not that great at all,"This devotional is geared towards college graduates who are pondering the significant questions of life. In that sense, the topics brought up are quite relevant. However, I would have to say that this devotional is not that great; although I wouldn't say it is not terrible either. The first half quite boring, and many devotionals don't deal much or at any significant amount with Scripture. Most (if not nearly all) devotionals given are thoughts of the author's on the given topic. Scripture is not expounded upon deeply to show the Biblical support or framework for a given topic. Part of the problem likely lies in the fact that it is a collection of excerpts from her writings."
3,For the diehard fans only...,"While the first few tracks on Nerf Herder's ""My E.P."" (orginally released on Joey Cape's now dead label, My Records) still stand as some of Nerf's funniest songs, the three new songs (four counting the bonus track) suffer from the same problem that the majority of their last album, ""American Cheese"", did: it's just not that good. None of it stacks up to any of the lyrics from ""How to Meet Girls"" or music from ""Nerf Herder"". However, it's still worth a buy to hear the original songs remixed and remastered (they all sound excellent), and to see the very funny ""Sportsman Bar"" music video. But note that the orginal bonus track, ""Come Back Down"" has been removed."
5,Provided in effort to distribute pure quality,From what I understand this is basically a b-side CD. Based on the quality of the songs I wouldn't call any of these songs b-sides. I honestly can't see how they could cut any of these songs from any of their previous albums! If you like Nerf Herder then you will definately like this EP... so buy it!!! These songs are definately in compliance with all quality control laws and standards set by these ROCK GODS!
4,It takes some work...,"Hey, if you're like me, a bit disappointed with the latest Nerf Herder ep, I figured out a solution to make it better.1. Record ""Nerf Herder,"" ""How To Meet Girls"" and ""My E.P"" all onto one CD-R. On an 80 minute disc there isn't quite enough room for the hidden track, so I replaced it with ""Doin' Laundry"" from the short comp, and the Buffy theme.2. Place CD-R in car stereo.3. Play on random mode.After a few listens, I loved the ep as much as the albums, looking forward to those songs sometimes more than my old favorites! This works especially well if you didn't like ""Love Sandwich"" at all the first time around.""You and me and Steve makes three, and Fernando and Mr. Belvedere in the hot tub, yeah!"""
4,National Geographic - World's Most Dangerous Gang,This was recommended by a College of Justice and Safety professor to use as a source for a High School senior project and was well worth it.
1,Awful!!!,I bought this product because of the great reviews. I have 2 Maltese dogs on which I used this. They were so tangled after I finished it was shocking. I'm a hairdresser so a they got a good scrub and rinse. I usually use a tangle free product for human's which works ok. Just thought I would try this product especially made for dogs. So disappointed. My older dog actually started scratching after his hair started to dry. I had to go back and shampoo this product off him. I don't see what everyone is raving about??? :(
5,Excellent investment for your money whether you are a buyer or a seller.,"I have only read about half of the book so far and already I have used many of the tips and scripts. All the scripts mentioned in the book are available online so you don't have do all that typing. Many of the hacks are not really hacks, but tips and recommendations on how to do things.The only minor complain I have is that the book references other chapters, but you have to go back to the Table of Contents to find the page number for the chapter. I think each page should have the current chapter number on it.Each page does have the hack number on it so it makes it easy to find a hack without going back to the table of contents."
5,Must have reference book,This is a not a read thru and your done. Keep this book on your desk for constant reference if you are going to be a serious eBayer.
1,Not The Same,"Product shown is not the product received. There is a new ""Casual"" - not sure if it is even by Paul Sebastian - in a new (purple) box. This is what I received. This new Casual is not the same as the original."
1,Old stock,"I love casual perfume, in fact it is the only perfume I have worn for last 10 years or so. So, getting it super cheap from Amazon was a great find for me.When I received the product yesterday, I checked the bottles to make sure they were in good condition. Unfortunately, this must be some very old stock because it does not smell right. Rather than having a light floral, citrusy scent, it smells like rubbing alcohol. And it looks a lot darker in color. Those are two signs that the perfume is no longer any good.Huge disappointment."
1,Casual Fine Parfum Spray 4 ounces,This is not the original Casual that I used to buy. It is yellowish in color and would not buy it again..
5,LOVE IT,"I've been wearing this for almost ten years now, my mom got me hooked on it. I always get asked what i'm wearing. However like most, it doesn't smell the same on everyone. Lasts all day without being over powering. I'd describe it as musk/floral."
1,Casual,This cologne is not really the Casual perfume. I have been using this product for around 15 years and the color of this perfume is very pale as opposed to the original which is a definite yellow and the fragrance is fruitier. I attempted to return the package but was unable as Amazon labels it a hazardous product. If that is the case why don't they advertise that in their product description? I resent paying for something which is obviously not the original product. The only reason I gave it a 1 star was because I received it promptly. It diminishes my decision to purchase many items from Amazon in the future. I have already purchased fewer items because of their delay in shipping.
5,casual cologne,"My favorite cologne, smells so clean and fresh. Wish i could find their lotion again i would buy it as well"
2,NOT the real thing,"This does not seem to be the real Paul Sebastian Casual fragrance. I am very disappointed with it... I ordered 3 bottles, and one was given as a gift. The shopping chg was extremely high as well... Dont ever want to order from this vendor again..."
5,Casual by Paul Sebastian,"I love this perfume, so glad I found your site, I was having a hard time finding it in my area."
2,costly to ship....,"i love, love this perfume....but the shipping on this one was really expensive...i didn't need them to overnight the product. but there was no other choice when ordering...so advertises low price for the product but the shipping is too much."
2,Not bad for liberal propaganda,"First the author does do a good job of explaining opinions and viewpoints on both sides. Both Western nations and Muslims see the other side as the aggressor and debates which side is the freedom fighter or terrorist. However where the film loses credibility is when the filmaker interviews Hamas and Hezbollah spokesmen. The filmaker never really challenges them on their previous statements and actions but allows them to Bill Clinton like use semantics to argue such things as resistance vs terror. In addition while attempting to paint the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush as extremists, the filmaker ignores the other quotes and speeches by the likes of Hassan Al Banna, Sayyid Qutb, and Bin Laden. It is almost like the filmaker was attempting to argue, ""What terrorist threat?"""
4,Truly unforgettable,"As other reviewers have said, this is a difficult book to read, because of the language but also because of the subject. The story gradually unfolds, allowing you to understand what the narrator really said, as opposed to what you think you read.But it's also difficult to read because of its subject matter. It is truly horrifying in a way that horror books never are.It is a great book, but if you read it, be prepared for it to stick with you, and to remember it at odd hours, and to feel the world is a little uglier after you've read it."
3,3 stars for an unusual book,"After the death of the father one of his children travels to a neighbouring town to buy a coffin: in this book the child describes the events during the first few days after the father has died. The children were raised by the father in cruel circumstances and virtually without contact with the outside world. Slowly but surely it becomes apparent that horror events have taken and are still taking place in the house. The language used in the book is very special as it is an odd mixture of outdated and harsh words. The child has been raised with the language of the father plus a library full of old fashioned books of which Spinoza, the bible and the memories of the Duc de Saint-Simon were the most important ones. This unusual language makes the book very special, but the story line was in my opinion rather thin, so 3 stars."
4,Interesting selection of primary sources,"This is not a series of articles written by Bruno Leone; it is a compilation of primary sources (i.e. items written during the Middle Ages), with a short intro explaining each. The translations are pulled from editions ranging from the 1880s to the 1920s, so the English is a bit pedantic or stilted; they still get their point across, students just might need a dictionary. As readers go this one has more interesting selections; if you are looking for a primary source reader that doesn't include lots of legal codes, charters, and writs this might be for you. For an instructor looking for a class reader, its one drawback is that there are no questions (so you'll have to supply your own)."
2,Faulty titling,"The music is wonderful. HOWEVER, only the first disc has the correct song titles and artists. The other five discs have most of the same song titles and artists as Disc #1, although the music on each disc conforms to what is listed in the catalog. When we attempted to rip the music onto our ""Windows Media Player"", where we keep all our music stored to play through our hi-fi system, we could copy only the first disc. All the other discs had those same song titles and artists (although the music was different) and the program reported only that the song was already copied. Apparently your quality control was off work that day.Have you had other such complaints? One wouldn't know about this if one were to simply play the discs on a CD player. They would seem to be fine. Is there any recourse for those of us who have a computer-based hi-fi system?"
4,Good value for money,"This is a fine collection for people who are starting out in opera appreciation. Most recordings are decent. Being new ot opera, I have no basis to technically critique the recordings or performances, but I have enjoued listining to most of the recordings."
3,Love farming games,I received the game almost before the week was out. I love farming games and I am right into this one
4,RFAHM,"Have Play this game for about 40 day, There are so many thing you can do here that make the game alot of fun to play. After playing this game for some time, i have found out that you can earn gold much faster by doing mining instead of farming. I can keep telling you alot about this game, but then it will spoil all the fun.Instead thing you people should try it out for you self."
4,So addicting...,I remember playing this game a while back and decided to buy it and I just love it.The graphics are amazing and it's very addictive. I'll be buying the 2nd and 3rd one too!!
4,a great new creative installment in the classic Harvest Moon series,"for the cult following of those who love Harvest Moon, this is a great addition, adding an adventure/RPG element to the normal gardening/story part of the game. Its really creative, and interesting and fun. While the story is for young children, and not particularly compelling or interesting, the game is still very fun and engaging on its own. Its my favorite harvest moon yet actually ^^"
4,My Rune Factory Game,"This review is by my eight-year-old. He plays it all the time.""It's like Harvest Moon but better. You get to get a spear, ax, and sword.You get a fishing pole for free when you go to this beach. There are lesser demonds. It's good. It's good that there's monsters. Sometime they're smart enough to do your chores for you. Some of them aren't smart. I like to battle the ones that are green and carry long swords. You get to catch a ton of different kinds of fish. You get to cook them. You can catch squid, lobster, shrimp, rainbow trout.""Did I mention he plays it ALL the time."
2,A twist on the original harvest moon formula that falls short.,"If you're looking for a good Harvest Moon game, keep looking, because this is not it.The voice-acting is mediocre, and the translation is terrible. The game is riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, very unprofessional. Not only that, but the writing is extremely dumb. It's one of those anime games you don't want someone watching you play.Do you want fighting? Do you want farming? Do you want both of those? Well you get them!... Sort of. They've sacrificed certain aspects of the fighting to make way for the farming, and then they've gotten rid of some features in farming to make way for fighting. The combination leaves much to be desired.Your potential partners are all looks and that's it. You will not find anything of value beneath the ribbons and lace, as all of the characters in the game are lacking in personality, making them incredibly boring to woo."
3,Okay,I got this game for Christmas and I was a little disappointed with it. The instrution booklet didn't tell you how to do anything! I'm the kind of person who likes just to scan through when a person is talking and you can't do this on this game. I missed the part where it told you to plant seeds and all that stuff. So this game would probably be fun if I knew how to do things.
3,this game drives me nuts,"I really don't think this game is much. The monsters terrify me and the storms blow in so much stuff it takes forever to get it out.Finding a girlfriend is pretty easy but just upgrading your house takes 2,000 pieces of wood and 200,000 g. So, if I were you, I'd go and play a game with more to it and things that are cheap and things that don't terrify you!"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!! ****,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game. It is great for a gamer who is sick of the usual hack and slash and needs a different kind of break. I had never played a Harvest Moon title before so I am coming from that perspective. I played Animal Crossing and liked it ok, so I thought I would try this game out and I am GLAD that I did.It is alot of fun and is in my opinion more fun then Animal Crossing as it has a bit more challenge to it. I think the graphics are cute and done well and it offers quite a few different things to do.I had been getting burned out on all my fighting based RPG PC and DS games and this was a really great break from that.I will give one warning though.... THIS GAME IS EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE. So make sure you have time to sink into it before you get it."
5,Rune Factory DS Game,I bought this game for my daughter who has been playing the Harvest Moon games for years and loves them. She loves this one too and has hardly put it down since Christmas.
4,Good game,"Reviewed by my child: ""I've played this game for a few months now and it is very fun and quite addicting. The graphics are great and trying to defeat the ""boss"" is challenging. What I don't like about it: defeating the ""boss"" can be frustrating at times."""
4,I guess it's good,"My best friend has been using this bag for more than three years, and it's still in one piece, so I guess it's a decent bag. Even if you can't put much stuff into it, it'll definitely last some time! It's also really nice, one looks good with it."
3,Have to have 2 chargers,"I only gave this 3 stars because of the fact that I had to purchase a ""dumb"" charger to go along with this $90 charger. Little by little I kept getting the error message on my batteries until nearly all of them were useless. Thankfully the person who commented on JL's review was able to explain why. When the batteries are too depleted, you'll get an error message, stick them in a cheapo charger for 10 minutes and it fixes the problem. I had to spend an extra $20 to buy a ""dumb"" charger because I needed one that would charge every size. Sooo...while it does a fine job of recharging batteries that are not completely depleted (which is a pain to monitor), I expect more out of a $90 charger."
5,Easy to use and fast!,"Pop the battery in and it does everything else! The only complaint I have is how big it is, but it does hold 16 batteries!"
5,a ray of hope,"Anyone who feels there is no way for parties in the Middle East to find a road to peace will be heartened by this film born out of tragedy. But this is a bigger and more important story than what is transpiring in the Middle East. This is a film about grief and and transformation, about choosing the path of peace instead of retribution. Kudos to the Producers for bringing this story to the public. There is hope out there, and the lessons of this film about personal transformation are important lessons for us all."
1,No subtitles...,"This said there were english subtitles when I rented it online. However, when I watched it, there were no such subtitles. LAME. How am I supposed to understand it? I am sure it is a fantastic movie, but I just wasted $2. And there is no button to turn on subtitles either."
1,good fisrt half bad scond,first half is good with good voice cast. second half j to x is badly dubed and the voice are different and flat sounding. sadly that ruins the whole box set
3,Get Mung-Mung instead,"I bought this book because our family enjoyed Mung-Mung, about animal sounds, so much. This idea sounded good, but just doesn't seem as fun or engaging."
2,Good compilation- of bits and pieces,"I was excited to see such a great collection of classics, but I was really disappointed to listen and discover that many tracks are shortened dramatically. A fraction of Rhapsody in Blue- a ridiculously short fragment of Bethoveen Ninth Symphony- ""Ode to Joy"" a tiny part of the first movement of Rachmoninov's Piano Concerto no.3.I'd rather have fewer tracks and the complete movements."
5,Great Listening,A friend of mind had this set and when I heard it I decided to order it. I recommend it highly as a nice collection of classical music you can enjoy hour after hour.
3,Plate rack,I found them to be too small for my large white plates.Its a little light in weight-not as solid as I had expected- but fine for smaller plates.
4,Helped with my oral presentation,"I had to do a college oral presentation on Gandhi, so the book really helped me out a lot."
1,Expensive Piece of Junk,"I mistakenly bought a 2nd one of these clocks after the first one stopped working after about 10 months. The second one lasted about 7 months. With both of them, the projected numbers got messed up and couldn't be read any more. These are expensive and not worth it for the short life span. Look elsewhere!"
1,Projection breaks after 10 months,I bought this and it worked nicely for about 8 months. At that point I noticed that the numbers that the projector was projecting looked weird. You could still make out the numbers but there'd be random strokes in the numbers. (Imagine a 0 projected by this clock but with the horizontal red line added in the middle to make the number 8). After a few more months the randomness made the numbers unreadable. I'd say the projector broke. The short life span does not make this product worth it.
3,Daylight Projection Clock,Since this came from the USA the connector was for 110V only. I took it to a shop and had it changed to a 220V connector. Good idea. It can be used at parties (which is how I use it).
1,Same as the other reviews,As other reviewers have mentioned the projection on this clock stops working over time. Mine worked for almost a year before the numbers were unreadable. It's a shame because this was one of the best projection clocks I had found. I didn't use it as an Alarm clock so I can't comment on those features. The clock also lacked a battery backup so I would hesitate to use it as an alarm clock.
3,"Good, but not great","Average film. Great for beginners and not-so-good cameras. Perfect for Holga 135's. For better 35mm SLR's, it's too grainy."
3,Add some music to this book,"HEROES AND VILLAINS will tell casual Beach Boys fans things they didn't know about America's Band. Bigger fans who would like to read more about the making of the Beach Boys' music may wish to look elsewhere - but when you think about, even WOULDN'T IT BE NICE, the autobiography of Brian Wilson, was light in that department. HEROES AND VILLAINS tracks the personal tumult that followed the Beach Boys from inside the Wilson household throughout their career. One of many lowlights: a Beach Boys bodyguard punched out one group member and had an affair with another's wife - quite the opposite of the harmony the band created on record. I read HEROES AND VILLAINS in 1988 and don't know if it has been updated. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Brian Wilson's break with Dr. Landy, Al Jardine quitting the band, and Carl Wilson's death certainly merit a new chapter."
3,Just See What you've Done,"A sometimes insightful and sometimes frightening book about one of the greatest songwriters of our time. Not enough written about the music itself and a lot of tabloid stuff, to be sure."
2,Hack Job,"Gaines turns in the same kind of lurid performance he did with the Beatles. He has dug up all the dirt he can find, all of which we could have imagined and none of which tells you much about any of the music or personalities involved. There's more information here about certain record company executives and swindlers than there is about Al Jardine or many of the other group members. It's amusing enough for an airplane ride, but that's about all."
2,Tabloid Journalism,"I was going to buy this book until I read some comments by Beach Boys experts on their websites.they all describe this book in the same way-tabloid journalism riddled with innacuracies and falsehoods.To be sure,it seems look a good read,but just remember that it is largely fiction."
1,Heroes and Villains- Book Portrays Beach Boys as Villains!,"Heroes and Villains, perhaps the most outraging book I've ever read. So many things in this book have been proven to be wrong, seeing that I have read several books on The Beach Boys. All wrong!"
2,Nothing great!,"It is quite a disappointment! If you are expecting something juicy in this book, you won't find much with this author. Sorry to say this but I find this book rather dry with too much details about only two particular Beach Boys. How the author goes on and on about a particular Beach Boy really brings the whole book down. In the first four chapters I have already lost most of my interest in continuing reading. Most of the time I am skipping pages of too much details given."
4,I really enjoyed reading this!!!!!,"This was a very informative and interesting book. While I did already know many of the things in this book, there were still more things I learned by reading it. Despite the ups and downs the Beach Boys had, I still love them. My only complaint about this book is that at times, it delved too much into the business affairs of the band, which bored me to death. I skimmed over those parts, just retaining the general ""idea"" of the paragraphs, and went on to the more interesting reading."
1,Not about the music,"Gaines is a muckraker. If you're interested in The Beach Boys incredible musical contribution to modern pop music don't read this book. If you want to read about drugs,sex,and the general mayhem that forms the backdrop of most of the rock groups that we know and love then this is the book for you. Back in the late 1980's when Gaines was touring the country promoting this book, I was fortunate enough to get into the audience of a local talk show here in Baltimore called ""People Are Talking"". Gaines was one of the guests that day, and the host of the show allowed me, book in hand, to confront Gaines with a number of mistakes and inaccurate details. Gaines's reply to me was that it was no different than getting dressed in the morning and forgetting to button a button or putting on mismatched socks.After the show Gaines came up to me offering to sign my book which I let him do, I think he respected my love for The Beach Boys. Never-the-less it felt great calling him out on T.V."
2,"Business, no pleasure","Another relative hack job from Gaines, whose book about the Beatles was also pretty lurid. Here the problem is not only that he focuses almost exclusively on unpleasantness, (though there are very occasional good passages about the music), but also that he keeps taking time out to introduce every two-bit friend or advisor in great detail, while giving little personality to any of the Beach Boys themselves. He then delves numbingly into complicated business deals, none of which throw much light on anything."
2,Did not wash well at all!,I was very disappointed with the quality of the sweatshirt I purchased. Considering the price I expected an item of higher quality.I will say the company is easy to deal with and I have sent it back to be replaced. After only 2 washings it looks as if my son has had it for 10 years. It is full of pills and has lost the smooth feel that under armour is best known. I am hoping it was a defect and the new item will live up to the price and reputation.
2,I didn't care for it,"Hey I love Indie films and B-movies, and though I can appreciate the effort that went into this, the final result was less than lukewarm.Four bank robbers have a car accident (It was a possumn!!) and are forced to walk the highway. They are picked up by kindly Al and are lead to a farmhouse occupied by a pretty young girl and her deaf/blind father. Well it drags from here and is pretty boring until the rape scene.***SPOILER AHEAD***The bank robbers are dead and have been dead since the car crash. The farm house is the key to heaven and hell, known in this movie as the 'dark' and 'light' sides. The balance must be maintained so some go to the light and some go to the dark no matter what.***End Spoiler***Some pretty good special effects at the end. The only real problem with this film is it does drag alot, but the sound isn't that great. Shot with a camcorder, it's really hard in some spots to tell what people are saying.Not bad, but I wouldn't watch it twice."
4,Good at the end,"The beginning drags a bit, but in the end, I was up in my chair and ready to deal. The creepy atmosphere is the winner in this film. It's not super gory, but there are some good special effects considering the budget.Give it a try if you like indie films."
1,Poor customer service!,"I recieved the incorrect product, attempted to return it and was given a run around. I'm out $55 and stuck with a youth size 7 instead of an adult xl. I use amazon pretty regularly, but this seller soured my feelings about it."
3,"Great product, but with limitations","I purchased this DVD Recorder about a year ago and have basically been happy with it. It is very easy to set up, set the timer, record. The remote works well. The main problem I have encountered is that often, when you turn it on to record, there is a hissing in the recording. If you turn the recording off, and start the recording again, the hissing is not there. This is ok if you are home and there to correct the hissing sound, but not ok if you are gone and have set the timer to record something that you really want to see on tv and its destroyed by the hissing noise. This functionality of the machine is very disappointing. Its simple to assign titles to what you have recorded. I'm waiting for another generation of the machines to come out and upgrade to a better model."
1,Very poor product - DON'T BUY,"Since purchasing R6740 from HSN, my unit has been returned to GoVideo 4 times. You would think that a brand new unit being return within the first 30 days with a problem would be replaced with a new unit, NOT, they replaced with refurbised units. One unit was so used that the buttons were worn. R6740 was a huge mistake. Compatability issues, failed recordings, not able to erase and reuse a RW disc. Problems go on and on and on. Money wasted!!!!"
2,Do they build these things to be disposable?,This DVDR lasted 15 months. It was plagued by intermittant operation and now the door won't open. Can't recommend this one.
4,So Cool,"I'm VERY pleasantly surprised! This inexpensive recorder makes good-looking video and just worked right, out of the box. I got Fuji DVD+RW discs to try, for no particular reason, and the machine had no issues.If you need special features, you might want to look at another unit, but this one covers the basics quite nicely."
4,Well Worth The Price,I enjoyed this particular CD. It was all that I expected and more. I am considering purchasing the rest of the series.
2,Gloomy,"After reading this book by Helyn Hitchcock, I found it extremely depressing. For me personally, she makes too many references to ""death."" After attempting to correlate her information to some of my family members, I had nightmares thinking death was around the corner for each of them. There are some interesting points but, I have since found other authors that have been helpful in my quest to learn numerology. I suggest you read various authors and find the commonality in all for a good place to start."
2,Who Wants to Predict Their Own Death?,"Overall, the book is comprehensive and accessible to all readers. What I don't like is that Hitchcock is irresponsible enough with this occult crud to enable one to predict the time of his or her own death. That's all I have to say. I would offer this one instead:The Complete Idiot's Guide to Numerology, 2nd Edition. Don't be fooled by the title; it's excellent - and responsible."
3,Those Days are Gone,"Firstly, thanks to KPFK for bringing us a chance to listen to Dream Syndicate live. But, like so many other time travels, this one leads to disappointment. The edgy, raw, crisp, feedback-laden zone we were transported to on the original ""Days of Wine and Roses"" LP, certainly is nowhere to be found here. where is Karl Precoda's sloppy, instinctive, savant playing? Steve Wynn may have the franchise, but magic is not for sale here. Leave my hot dog in the wrapper - I'll warm it over myself, thanks."
2,Affinity roar 467cc,"Am not happy with the product at all. I used it twice on the driving range and the head went flying about 50 yard, i was left holding the shaft i was ashamed, they had to stop everyone on the range so that they could retreive the head. Purchase it at your own risk, it's not worth $38 save the money and buy a better brand for $60 plus."
3,Orchestral Guitar Noise,"Very edgy symphonic music written for an army of guitarists and a couple of drummers. Branca's music seems blunt and simple on the surface, but, paradoxically, subtleties emerge at high volume. His stated themes for these works are life and death, and he does evoke the joys and anxieties of existence through the ambling drums and slowly-building harmonies of the guitars. More and more the listener comes to identify with the spirits of these works until, in the final crescendo, all is lost in the despair of certain death. What more can you ask for?"
2,"Buy for the CD, is a Dud for reading","The Test engine on the CD is GREAT. The chapters cover 50 to 70 percent of what is on the IBM family fundamentals Certification (I have the IBM DB2 512, and 513 DBA certs). On the test engine, the answers refer to certain chapters in the book. These references that they refer to do not exist in MANY cases. If you want to get an in depth coverage of the two certs (512 and 513)get the ""All In One DB2 Administration Certification Exam Guide"" by Roger Sanders(Test engine is horrible). For testing practice The Dummies book test engine is the best I have seen and is worth getting just for that purpose. Having another book for reference never hurts either."
5,Helped me pass 512 with ease,I read this book over the course of one week before I took the exam. I passed without any problems. I wanted to do the labs included in the book but never got around to it although they seemed helpful. I also found that the sample test engine on the included cd had a few errors. I didn't rely too heavily on it though. IBM has sample questions on the web that reflect what you'll see on the test anyway.
3,Wanted to Like It...,"I wanted to like this book, but Thurman made it hard for me. He's a knowledgeable and astute writer, but I found his message a bit, well, evangelical for my taste, which is ironic considering this is a book about Buddhism. His obvious and strident dislike of America and capitalism is a big turn off. I guess if you agree with this politics, or can ignore his constant, tiresome references to what's wrong with America, blah, blah, you can learn a great deal about Buddhism from this book.It would have been nice to have a little less preaching, ego, and more teaching."
2,Mediocre introduction with a lot of mistakes in arguments...,"If you have a choice between this and Pojman, get Pojman. I don't particularly like either of them, but Pojmans ""Ethics"" is definately the better one.BAD: The chapter on subjectivism is completely confused - this book has no proper introduction to meta-ethics nor is its place in general ethics explained. The chapter on relativism is ok, but I would say that there are serious mistakes there too. The chapters about utilitarianism are just too simplistic and exclusive.GOOD: The chapterson the social contract and the chapter on Kant are both good, as is the chapter on feminist ethics. It is good to see that stuff usually left out (social contract, feminist ethics) is included here.Overall you should get something else for a good introduction to the subject and if you already have some knowledge of the field, this book will be of no interest whatsoever."
1,MM,"I used Rachel's text for my students in an undergraduate course in Ethics, and was extremely disappointed and frustrated. Rachels freely promotes his own political views and concerns in a way that severely curtails effective classroom discussion."
5,This pieces it all together,"I came across this book while writing ""The Encyclopedia of Networking."" What a great resource. I was trying to write a historical outline by referring to the RFCs written during the early years of the Internet. What a task! This book puts it all into perspective. Salus has interviewed the people involved, including Cerf and many others, and in so doing, has made a major contribution to the Internet historical archives. Never mind that it is getting a little dated. Its a great read and kept me up past midnight."
5,Some of Miles' Best,"According to NPR, today is the 50th anniversary of the Kind of Blue album. Classic band, classic tunes. The other two albums are classics too. This set is a real bargain. Miles at his creative best.(I had a problem with the box set packaging. The plastic guts the CDs attach to had separated from the cardboard cover. Superglue to the rescue.)"
2,Getting A New Battery Is Apparently Impossible,"This phone was decent except for two things:1. It doesn't stay clipped to your belt or pants very well.2. Most importantly, after 6 months of trying, I have not been able to find a replacement battery after mine would not recharge anymore. There appears to be one supplier and after several letters from them updating me that the battery was backordered, it was finally cancelled completely."
3,Very Convenient,"This phone is great in that it is convenient and frees up your hands to do other things while still carrying on a conversation. I do English tutoring over the telephone and am on it for a long period of time. I didn't get sore ear like I do with traditional handsets. That was a big plus for me. I found the reception was pretty good, but sometimes the person I was talking to said that I didn't sound loud enough. The phone dials very loudly, I had to pull the headset off while I pushed in numbers.All in all, I was satisfied, but not impressed."
1,Thoroughly disappointed!,"I was so excited to see this compact size phone to clip on to my belt and talk with the headset. I am so disappointed. The clip never stays on, always falls off while I'm talking, thus disconnects my phone call! Ugh! Not to mention, the headset swivel practially rips my hair out every time even when I take it off very carefully! Not at all the item I had hoped for."
1,Where's the mute?!?,"I have been searching for a replacement for my older GE 29917A everywhere. I ordered this phone online since the specs listed a mute button--critical for those 2 hr. + concalls. THERE IS NO MUTE FEATURE!! Now I have to pay to ship this back. Where can I find a small, lightweight headset phone with mute that won't cost a fortune?"
3,Prefer the old headset,My new GE headset is still charging for the first time but the first thing I found right away is I don't like the headset on the new model. My old model is the 2-9918A. It has a fantastic headset. The new headset feels too squirmy with swiveling joints and the gooseneck mic is really floppy. I only put it on when I receive a call and I know I'll be adjusting it each time.Can anyone recommend a replacement mic that works like the old one? (ie. No swivel and firm gooseneck that stays in place when you put it down on the table.)
4,CLASSY EARRINGS,"THESE ARE A GIFT TO A VERY STYLISH LADY AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. DETAIL NICE, SIZE RIGHT. CAN'T USE THE NECKLACE BUT I AM SURE IT WOULD BE LOVELY TOO. BUY IT WITH CONFIDENCE."
5,Such pretty earrings!,"I love these earrings, they are so pretty and I get complements on the time on them! Perfect size and great price. Also its been six months since I bought, and they still look like day one- The silver keeps well- Very happy I bought these! :)"
5,Very nice earrings for the money.,"Great value for the price (a Lightning Deal). I'm SUPER fussy, and I can't fault these earrings in any way."
4,So good,They are very elegant and delicate. It's not my favorite style actually (bought them as a present) but I'm satisfied.
4,Extremely Pleased,"I am very happy with these earrings. Considering the price, it's a bargain. These look like they cost double the actual price. I plan on stocking up now for birthday gifts for my friends & relatives!!!"
5,Love them,I gave these to my mom for Mothers Day and she seemed very pleased with them. She has arthritis in her hands so this type of earring is much easier for her to use than a post with the small back. She said she has received many compliments on them from people she has seen.
2,Not enough about needlecraft,"Monica Ferris' first three books, Crewel World, Framed in Lace, and Stitch in Time were delightfully set in the needlecraft world. Then she began to wander. With her fifth book, A Murderous Yarn, needlecraft is only a setting for a story about antique cars and the events surrounding one of the owners. Sure, the folks meet and greet in the needlecraft store and many heavy discussions take place there. Customers come in and Betsy, the owner, helps them choose canvases and floss and all the rest of it. There is the usual simplistic cross stitch pattern included in the back of the book. But the main thrust of the story is antique cars. If I wanted to read about antique cars I would have chosen another author. I wonder if Ms. Ferris has exhausted her ability to devise more needlecraft plots. I'm hoping for better in her next book in this series. And, I'm switching over to Mary Kruger's knitting series."
4,A great series!,"I love this series and this was the first book I read in the series! It was great, although I love some of the earlier ones more now. But the ones after are also great!In this one Betsy helps out with an antique car race, but then one of the contestants is murdered and Betsy has to figure out the whodonit. The ending is really kind of cool!The worst part of this, for those of us who love this as a series, is that Betsy really doesn't spend much time in the shop or in Execelsior, as most of this is set in the Cities."
5,an excellent addition to the Needlecraft series,"There is not much needlecraft in this title as others in the series, but that is okay. Because, in this book you find that Betsy has interests beyond needlecraft. Which makes her a more interesting person. I truly like Betsy and look forward to meeting up with her in future books."
4,A Murderous Yarn (Needlecraft Mysteries),As usual a very good mystery novel from the Needlecraft Mysteries by Monica Ferris
2,Not up to par,"As a cross-stitch AND antique car enthusiast, I was really looking forward to reading this book. This is my first Monica Ferris, and it is my last. Her character exposition is so poor that throughout the early pages of the book, I couldn't remember which character was supposed to be the amateur detective.The writing style is downright boring, and I am unimpressesd with the plot, as well.If you are looking for mysteries with ""women's"" themes, I recommend the culinary mystery series by Diane Mott Davidson, and the quilting mysteries by Earlene Fowler. Earlene Fowler in particular is an awesome novelist."
4,Steaming Up the Shop,"Monica Ferris introduces antique car collectors to her mixture of needlework and murder in Minnesota. Lars, partner of continuing character Jill, acquires a Stanley Steamer and draws the needleworking Monday Bunch into his enthusiasm. The novel is amusing, vivid, and detailed. While the murder is a minor factor, the interesting way in which the solution is reached, and the development of continuing characters in an appealing setting are great fun. Ferris is an excellent writer under any name!"
3,More than cross-stitch,"I had heard a lot of good things about this series, and being a fan of cross-stich and needlepoint, was looking forward to reading one of them. I was surprised to see that needlecraft seemed to take a back seat (pardon the pun) to the antique cars featured prominently in the plot of this entry into the series.Perhaps earlier books in the series were more focused in needlework, and this one did include a pattern at the back. And it did contain some interesting information on antique cars."
3,Limited Fun,Thought this would bring alot more fun to our Gameboy player. Found limited fun with this product. Not even a challenge.
3,alright game,it's all right but you have to repeet all the levels and thta sucks thats why i gave it 3 starts weather then that its ok game!!
3,PLATE RACK,"In the description of this item it said it was 17"" high. I received it and it is more like 24 - 25"" high which is too high for the place I was going to use it. It was also missing one of the rubber tips on the feet. A first grader could have packed it better!!!!!!"
1,dissatisfied,I received this item - in the description is stated is was 17 inches long when in reallity it was 22 - unable to use still sitting in the box unused - tried to contact the 800 # given by the rep to return - to date no luch
4,Great for parties!,"The only issue we ran into was that our plates were too big (by about 1/2 inch) so we had to buy some plates that would fit. Other than that, they are perfect."
2,Disappointing,"The important measurement that needs to be included with this item (and is NOT) is the interior. It is 10 3/4"" from one side to the other INSIDE the vertical rods of wrought iron. If your plate is wider than 10 3/4"", it is NOT going to fit in this thing. I really wanted to use my beautiful china with this, not buy new plates! AND GUESS WHAT... My stand also arrived missing one of the rubber feet. This throws off the balance and might scratch my table. This company has issues with quality control. No attention to detail! Very disappointing."
2,STILLBORN,"Here's what's right with this movie:1. The dog who plays Einstein.Here's what's wrong with this movie:1. The Outsider is obviously an actor in a monster suit and it harkens back to the days of inferior monster movies.2. Mark Hamill is woefully miscast and gives a performance that is unbelievably bad.3. There is no tension or suspense in the direction of John Carl Buechler, who also ""created"" the monster suit.4. Dean Koontz has not been very successful in the adaptations of his novels; he needs to find someone who can really get into and understand them a lot better.Final summary:Read the book and forego this corker."
5,Changed my life,"Along with like...In Utero, Daydream Nation, the Hot Rock, Unknown Pleasures, the VU & Nico, this is one of those records that gets you to view the possibilities of music differently...I mean this record puts hardcore to shame...makes black flag sound like britney spears...I love it sooo much, must have listened to it a thousand times..."
1,This is Terrible...,"Wow is this ever terrible. i mean, i dn't want to be rude or watever but how can anyone call this the music that saved their lives? So many people are raving about this record and how it totally changed their life and blah blah blah...its terrible! Seriously you want some good music? Start somewhere else."
1,A really boring classic,"This classic by Sinclair Lewis is set sometime in the early 1900s (1920s ?). It was written to show the shallowness of life of the average, middle-class men of the day in their pursuit for money, popularity, etc.I found this book to be incredibly long and boring, but I think that was part of the point. At any rate, it's a classic, and in the words of a great literary critic, ""These works are no longer on trial - the readers are."""
2,Doesn't tell much at all.....,"I must say this was rather dull to sit through and I was very tempted to hit the fast-forward button on many occasions. This amatuerish piece of work focuses on the personal lives of ordinary Iraqis- Sunni, Shia, and Kurd alike. The people being interviewed talk at length about irrelevant details of their lives there: school, work, their families, their hobbies, etc. It seems the main idea of this movie is for us to feel some type of personal connection to them?? There are very few things here that most viewers will be able to relate to or understand, if that is the director's intention. The only redeeming part of the film is the middle segment, which focuses on the Shia population in Sadr City. It offers an amusing glimpse into the local culture and politics that you really can't see on our local news channels."
4,"Phenomenal, but with problems...","This watch is phenomenal. I wish they would have kept on evolving this model. It has unlimited expandability, however it does have some negatives. First, my crown (the pull in/out setting mechanism) broke after 3 months. It no longer turns on the light, nor acknowledges I pulled it out. I have to set the watch through the computer and it limits the programs I can use on the watch. The other is the developer community has dried up for this thing. Nothing really new that I can see out there. I have some great ideas for 2 programs, but just don't have the time to make them.It would have been great for them to keep up the work on this and make it a little less ""cheap"" looking. Also, add a full higher res fully graphic LCD and it could get very interesting.It gets 4 stars for being great, but breaking too easily... Great first try at this type of watch!"
1,Band Sucks. No replacements available anywhere!,"A great overall watch. Band breaks easily, no replacements available.Timex does not offer them, Voguestrap used to offer but has discontinued ALL DataLink bands.Holding mine together with staples and electrical tap. On my fourth lousy band in 5 years.TIMEX.. get real and support your customers and create a band that will last. Mine will be ""Pocket Watch"" soon."
5,Great Watch!,"I ordered this Data Link USB watch to replace one that still worked but was looking pretty sad after heavy use and abuse. This will show my age but it reminded me of the old Timex commercial, ""takes a licking and keeps on ticking"". I love this watch. On the first one I used the USB connection for downloading from Microsoft Outlook but after awhile I didn't want all the information from Outlook in my watch so I started loading appointments manually. It is really pretty fast and easy. I like having so many alarms and the ability to have text identifying what they are. I just use simple terms like ""mtg"", ""wake up"", ""lunch"" etc. You can't beat the price."
2,"Good thinking, but breaks after a year","I've bought this watch because of the USB port to manage contacts, and the like, and it works great. The software that comes with it is not extraordinarily user-friendly, but you can manage. There's a lot of functions in there for a watch, such as contacts, calendar, etc...On the bad side, I've bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my dad, and both watches went blank at about the same date one year after the purchase. I thought it was the battery at first, but the alarm still rang in the morning, and I changed the battery, and the screen was still blank. So for a 100$ watch, I would expect a longer lifetime.I also needed to change the bracelet because it broke."
2,Ironman data link watch,"I purchased this watch about 4 years ago. Just after the warranty expired, the watch started resetting the time to Jan.1 and clearing all entered data. I called Timex and they were very nice and sent me a new watch; it has been another two years and the watch is doing the same thing. After about 3 hours it resets and clears all the memory.I really liked the watch a lot when it is working but I can't keep asking them to supply me with a new watch every two years. In fact it does not appear to be available any more and I can't afford to buy a new one every two years. I will have to look at Casio again.Don"
2,"A once great idea, pretty much abandoned","I loved the original DataLink watches with the software plugin to MS Outlook and the ability to program it just by holding it up in front of your monitor. I realize the technology has changed and accept the compromise of a USB cable, but it seems Timex really has no more interest in maintaining the product line. The software hasn't been updated in over five years, nor has product design. I guess it's a niche product and most people get this functionality on their cell phones these days. The cable is difficult to connect while wearing the watch. iCal events can't be imported to Appointments (only ""schedules"" which don't support alarms, etc. I don't have Outlook, so can't say whether the software can still reasonably import an exported calendar file from it. But it's not really usable with Lotus Notes or GMail calendar."
4,It does what they said it would do.,I'm happy with the watch. It does what they said it would do. Easy to use.
1,Timex Men's Ironman Data Link USB Watch (Battery dead twice!),Original & replacement Watch failed: Battery is dead!I called Timex directly and they offered to supply a replacement for the twice failed order from Amazon.Timex suspected that Amazon watch batteries were old.Hopefully the third watch direct from Timex will work!
5,Rating my purchase,"THE PRODUCT IS WELL DESIGNED AND EASY TO USE, A FEW MORE OPTIONS THANARE USEFUL TO A RETIRED PERSON."
3,Hard to Hear,"Good video concept... we all are learning something from it. However on many occasions the instruments are louder than the voice speaking. Of course that doesn't seem to bother my children any, as they enjoy the music! My boys ask for it often and have certainly gained an enthusiasm for learning Spanish from this DVD, but as a teaching aid, it will probably fall short."
2,Rock-n-Learn does not rock...,"I was disappointed with the DVD. In fairness, it is the first and only one I've purchased so I have nothing to compare it to, but after viewing it, I am not inspired to buy another. The music is lame and so are the ""actors."""
2,We did not enjoy the music,"This is not the video's fault though, perhaps. We were also watching it in the wrong suggested age group. It did not entertain me or the 4 yr old child. (Yes, she is four yrs, but more advanced in Spanish than average 4 yr olds). I'm so sorry. It was my least favorite of all videos we purchased recently. But perhaps, the music is more your style? I Don't mean to be negative... ?"
1,AAAAAHHHH!!!!,"I ordered this item wanting my children to start learning Spanish as a family.we were so excited when it came in .Low and behold when i took it out of the package and put it in ,it would not play......AAHHH!!! I have not had any problems with amazon products before so i did not keep any of the paperwork to return it.now i am stuck with an item that does not work and the girls are no closer in learning Spanish"
4,Useful and interesting but frustrating,"This is a useful book on a fascinating subject and has many interesting bits of information about the military and archaelogical aspects of things. But it's frustrating, too, it needs rather more quotes from the Roman authors. The pyschological and cultural aspects are also rather light on. Still, it's a start. (For a fascinating look at the episode, try also the Forest section in Simon Schama's amazing book, Landscape and History.)"
3,A tedious read,The weak leg of military history is that most of it is so badly written. This book is in that tradition. I've no doubt it is well-researched and factually accurate but the author has taken enough information for a magazine article and stretched it into a hardcover book. It is endlessly repetitious and tedious. Much of it is speculation on what MIGHT have happened. I don't think I'd buy this book again.
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't wait to start reading this book. The storyline promised great drama and the battle did indeed change the course of history. After about thirty pages, however, I found my attention wandering as I struggled through the muddled, repetitious text. I made it to the end only after a week of reading bite-sized five and ten page chunks of the book. The tedium stems both from Wells writing and the clumsy organization of the chapters. I finished the book still not fully comprehending the layout of the battlefield, as the few maps are crude and confusing. Speculation blends too frequently with fact. And the chapter on the battle itself offers little insight into the nature of such conflicts, with the author preferring to dwell on describing severed limbs, decapitations and rivers of blood. In summary, I'm glad to have read the book, given my earlier ignorance of such an important event, but can summon insufficient enthusiasm to recommend it to others."
2,Disappointment,"Reads like a history written by an anthropologist (and alas, that's exactly what it is). Not enough of either subject (archaeology or history) are approached effectively. The book is overall just poorly conceived and has several serious flaws. On whole the book is agonizingly repetitive with the same things being addressed just mere paragraphs apart. This would have been better off as a 45 page scholarly article. If Wells would have simply focused on the archaeological exploration of the battlefield the work may have been more successful."
3,Interesting but not too enlightening,"The author seems to have written this as a very basic coverage of what was likely a much more complicated situation. I didn't know anything about this incident in history, but from his own descriptions, it had far reaching consequences. I was hoping for a little more meat but as an introduction, it was sufficient. This just makes me want to find out more about the Teutoberg battle."
1,Interesting but full of speculation,"The three legions massacred in the German forests was only one of the many defeats suffered by the Romans, and by not means the most dramatic (just compare this to Cannae). Although catastrophic at the time, the Romans did not follow up with an aggressive campaign in Germany as the land did not provide any valuable commodity, and was considered poor for agriculture (unlike the British Isles were despite being defeated the legions returned). The book is interesting but I find it full of speculations, specially its conclusions. If interested in Roman military history buy one of Adrian Goldsworthy's books. They have greater analysis, and are very readable."
3,A prurient reveling in carnage...,"This book covers an interesting topic but is excessively repetitious. Moreover, about half of it is devoted to a completely speculative reconstruction of the battle. I can think of at least half dozen other ways the battle might have unfolded. The most disturbing aspect of the book, however, is the almost liplicking relish with which the author describes the variety of wounds the Roman soldiers might have suffered and the tortures to which they might have been subjected after capture. I have read a good bit of forensic pathology and am not easily put off by graphic descriptions of wounds, but the author's writing is a distasteful wallow in carnage."
5,Very good book!! Love it!,Worth the time and money.. My favorite book. It has some great theorys on life and ways to live happy and positive.
1,Absolutely Atrocious,"I LOVE Chic and the Nile Rodgers-Bernard Edwards team and I am surprised Nike Rodgers would allow his name and his group's name to be anywhere on this. I sold this after one listen, it is horrible and nothing like the Chic funk my ears like to hear. A penny is too much to pay for this trash."
1,Stay Away from This Item.......,"I've now gone through 2 of these chargers. The first one appeared to have overheated while charging 2 AA batteries; fortunately, it died within the 30 day return period, and Amazon proptly sent me a new one. The 2nd unit failed after about 6 months, and so far, I have not received any response from Ansmann USA or Ansmann DE regarding the warranty (which is supposedly 3 years). The 2nd unit appears to have overheated as well. All-in-all, it was a waste of money."
2,very disappointed,"I bought this charger because of it's ability to charge C,D, and 9 volt as well as AA and AAA. This feature makes it very convenient, however the performance is very poor. The charge cycle is way too fast so you know the batteries are not being fully charged. The alleged ""refresh"" function runs at best a few minutes which certainly is not long enough to do the job properly. After charging in this Ansmann charger, I then put the batteries into my La Crosse charger only to discover that the batteries were only charged to about half of their capacity. I end up still needing to use the La Crosse charger to finish off the charging and for refreshing or reconditioning. This charger is handy for a quick charge of multiple batteries and for multiple sizes, but do not buy it expecting to give your batteries a full charge or for reconditioning your batteries."
2,Energy 8 PLUS,"The seller was supposed to have sold me the Energy 8 charger, but sent me the Energy 8 PLUS which is a slightly different model. They expect me to return their mistake at my expense... not happy at all. As far as the product, it works ok as long as you make sure that the neg/pos connections are completely connected since there is room for error. It has also given me an error on a battery, but after moving it into another slot, it worked fine..."
3,Unit Failed - Awaiting Replacement,"The Ansmann Energy 8 charged three sets of C-sized NiMH seemingly well. Unfortunately, the unit failed after charging the third set. Awaiting authorization for a replacement unit. Will update this review upon receiving the new unit.Interesting note to those who complain about the lack of information provided about the indicator lights. Their function is explained very plainly on the bottom of the unit.Update 1: MyBatterySupplier was very helpful when they learned that the charger was defective. They provided me with the information to get a return merchandise authorization (RMA) directly from Ansmann USA Corporation for a replacement unit. I will update again when the new unit arrives."
3,"Product is OK, but not useful for the functionality I expected","The product is as described, but does not help me get rid of birds and squirrels as I was hoping to.The 1st day birds were sitting on it's head and squirrels kicked it away. The manual described that I should move it once in a while, but I can not move it every hour.I have not tried it but probably owls with sounds and moving features might have better affects. Or at least the ones with more shiny eyes. this one the look is very good but the eyes are not shiny enough"
2,not happy with the owl!!,I ordered the owl with the bobbing head but I didnt get it and it was too much trouble to pack it up and send it back.
4,Could it be true?,I had heard of the Philadelphia Experiment and wanted to know more about it. It was a frightening book for me. To think that this could have happened (the Government denies it) is science fiction in its elements but very possibly true.
1,Not about the experiment!,"As another reviewer points out, this book does not tell about the invisibility project itself. It merely offers theories and information from ""mysterious"" people. A strange not satisfying book on a subject I wanted to know a lot more about."
3,Covers the conspiracy more than the experiment ...,"But still more info than the other books that seem to be available on the subject. Still ... I'm thinking there was more available out there. I remember reading about it years ago, and I thought I knew a lot more than this book tells me <g>. Did I get it all from the movie???"
3,Other Books,"The Philadelphia experiment is one of those conspiracy theory type of books, with perhaps enough in it to make you wonder if it was true or not.However, the likelihood of being able to make a large US Navy ship disappear in the 1940s isn't very high, you would think. :) Makes for a groovy X-Files sort of investigation, though."
3,Interesting Read but Ultimately Unfulfilling,"I would have to say that this is a good starter book for anyone intrigued by the Philadelphia Experiment legend. I had high expectations when first reading this book and I found Moore's writing to be compelling at times (I peticularly enjoyed the chapter on Einstein). But, utlimately I was left wanting more at the end. Elements do tie together and cause the reader to think but mostly on the basis of speculation."
1,where's the story?,"I really thought I would be able to learn about the Philadelphia Project from this book, considering the title. However, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. The entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place.This book was disappoiting to an extreme."
2,Dont expect too much,"Because the navy officially denies that any such experiment ever occurred, there is virtually no information available about the experiment. Therefore the authors rely on second-hand accounts, hearsay, and the recollections of some individuals long after the alleged experiment occurred.Some of these accounts may or may not be true. The problem with this however, is that the authors do not attempt to document their sources. This means they are either unable or unwilling to document these sources. All of which means many or all of these sources or accounts could either be true or false.Basically, nobody will ever know, and the authors may have wanted it that way. Admittedly, the book IS interesting, as long as the reader takes in the material with a certain amount of cautious skepticism. But there doesn't seem to be anything here that is strongly substantiated. That doesn't prove it's NOT true, it only proves that it cannot be proven to BE true."
2,This is the worst i've read about the infamous experiment!!!,"I have read many articles and books about this philadelphia experiment...and i have to say this book is one of the worst. The author claims he has so much new information about this incident..but in actually he doesn't. I found he repeats alot of his arguments and statements alot throughout his chapters.There is better material than this. This book has nothing to do with the philadelphia experiment itself,just about theories if the experiment did actually happen. There is nothing about what actually occured during the experiment, his research is grade D. I suggest reading other books about the philadelphia experiment."
4,Military cover-up?,"I myself have done much research into the validity of the PX (Philadelphia Experiment). I should probably mention that I did this research before reading the book.This book is interesting indeed, but you can find out as much, if not more, from websites alone. Marshall Barnes (a private investigator) has also done a considerable amount of research on this subject, and I suggest you try to find transcripts of any interviews he has been in.So, will this book give you the secrets that the military so dearly holds? No, it won't, but it is worth the read."
2,"I wanted Al Bielek, got Morris K Jessup and Allende instead","Bottom line: I like Al Bielek's version of the PX better. This one is more to the original story. I like Al Bielek's personal account of time traveling. This book is more about the ""facts"" of the account. No Al Bielek in this book."
4,spirit lifting,"This is a great cd, almost every song had me swaying in my seat at my computer. The tunes have a slightly meditative effect, but are still lively and funky even. Highly recommended, Krishna Lila will transport you to a far-off land of exotic colourful streets and purple sunsets."
4,"Oddly appealing. Noisy, sloppy and yet Amazing.","I remember seeing 8-Eyed Spy live in NYC years ago and thinking they were awful. It was as if five people were jamming on a stage and couldn't hear each other and couldn't care less. This album shows them for who they really were. Lydia was the provocative lead singer who could really sing when she wanted to and had a knack for lyrics that is unsurpassed in No wave/Punk circles. The band, featuring Jim Sclavunos and Nick Cave rock. It seems when they weren't strung out and throwing attitude, these guys could really play. If your a Nick Cave fan and never heard Lydia or any of the Feotus stuff. Get this album."
4,Excellent reference and testing tool,"I have been using SAS in a professional environment for 5+ years. I just recently purchased SAS LE 2.0 and am very satisfied. Since the cost of a professional SAS license for personal use at home was out the question, SAS LE 2.0 was the next best thing. Often times the best ideas come outside of the office hours of 9-5 so I use it to test out ideas and concepts at home when those ideas pop up. The tutorial for inexperienced SAS users is very thorough. On the other hand, if you are familiar with SAS, you can easily just open the program editor and start writing code. It also provides a way to retain, sharpen, or refresh SAS skills if they are not being used in a professional setting."
4,Great starting point for proof of concept..,"Very simple, elegant and ready-to-go piece of software with significat capabilities to do proof of concept analysis on your personal machine."
3,A Matter of Principle,"This 6 volume reference (published in black and white) clearly describes 500 careers: what people do; what education/training is required; how much people earn; where to get more information (although more web addresses are needed). I especially liked this resource's highlighting of how specific careers are interconnected.My main reservation is that the photographs in this resource could cause children to feel excluded. Only 41 of the 500 photographs (each career has a picture) showed African Americans in a leading role (17 of the 41 depicted manual skills) and only 5 photographs showed Asian Americans in a leading role (a computer programmer, a computer networker and an acupuncturist account for 3 of the 5).In the Index I found ""School principles. See school administrators."" Startling for a children's encyclopedia."
3,Tropical Aquarium Week by Week,It is a good book but it is strictly for people that have never had a aquarium and are just setting it up or haven't yet.
5,THE best general freshwater aquarium reference I've read.,"This is a great and complete reference for the beginning to experienced aquarist. Excellent photos demonstrate what the text explains. The author not only introduces the more difficult technical procedures for keeping an aquarium, but clearly explains how to implement them and the natural processes they affect. I also particularly enjoyed that the author frequently discusses the latest innovations and equipment for the home aquarium. If there was one book for the aquarist that I would recommend, it would be this one."
5,A great book for beginners,"This book covers different topics from tank setup to maintenance. It is a well written book with a lots of pictures. Anyone can get a lot of information from internet, however, this book gives the best coverage of planning a beautiful planted aquarium step by step. I wish that I could read this before I bought my starter kit.While this is a great tool book to own for a beginner, I do wish it can go a little bit deeper on some of topics."
5,Wonderful,This book is one of a kind.the pictures are beautiful.the info is very easy to use and useful.and these kinds of hands on books are few and far between.it does all it promises to do..and more..its just relaxing to look at as well..its just not another art book with insturctions..it goes far beyond that...B.W.
2,"Get ""Dreamscapes"" by Stephenie Pui Mun Law instead.","The book is alright, but because the author isn't really the painter of ANY of the examples, it's not really great. David Riche just collects examples of well known artist and explains how they paint. The book however, spends way too many pages explaining what types of fairies there are and all this other nonsense junk that doesn't really have ANYTHING to do with technique and painting.If you really want a good book get ""Dreamscapes"" by Stephanie Pui Mun Law. It has everything this book has and more. Its better explained and written by the artist herself. The book is also longer, has WAY more examples, and explains not only how to paint fairies but their backgrounds as well. Trust me, this book is WAY better than ""Watercolor Fairies"" and costs the exact same amount."
4,A dazzling little tour through the final thoughts of a brilliant man,"This brief collection of Goodman's final writings offers an elegiac tour of Goodman's lifelong interests: anarchist pacifism, freudian psychology, poetry, literature, sexuality. It is a kind of summing up of his work, and is shot through with beautiful aphorisms.Readers looking for more focused treatment of Goodman's concerns would do well to seek out ""Drawing the Line"", ""Communitas"", ""Growing Up Absurd"", and ""Gestalt Therapy"", his masterpieces."
5,Great stuff,"I loved the hip hop / yiddish music mix ! Great hybrid music, it's inspired, you can feel the meticulous work behind it. I read socalled's got like 4000 jewish music albums and well, it shows!See also Ghettoblaster..."
1,Awful :(,"I love Balkan Beatbox and Matisyahu.. but ""so called seder"" was a so called... nightmare!I was actually appalled I had purchased it without hearing many of the songs. I know it's acceptable to say certain things in rap/hip-hop.. but when it comes to our music.. please don't even go there!!I was hoping for something more along the lines of Balkan Beatbox or Matisyahu, but sadly suprised at the lyrics I was hearing and sent it back to J-Dub with a letter why.. *sigh*"
1,Not worth it!,"I got this CD when I was the Youth Director at a JCC. I thought it would be perfect for the teens to get into Passover. Boy was I wrong. In the very first song, the N-word is dropped. As a Black Jewish woman I was so offended. I quickly threw the CD out. I expected so much more."
1,Language caution for children,"I was thinking about getting this for my elementary school kids to listen to. Something they would enjoy more than the usual sappy Passover music for kids. Thank goodness I listened to the clip of the final track. The song seems to be about a bad hangover after drinking too much wine (not a bad message) but I'm not about to play the ""f***"" word in my mini-van.In another 6 or 8 years, however, I think they'll love it."
1,bad,This item was advertised as being similar to Matisyahu. It was an embarrassment to listen to it..
2,Just kind of non,"Did you ever read that book ""I'm just not that into you?"" Well, that's how I feel about this album. I guess it's not bad persay, but it doesn't make me feel like it's good either. It's just kind of there, perhaps another gimick to capitalize on a holiday. Maybe not, but it neither makes me want to jump for joy or dance or do anything for that matter."
5,Exactly as expected,"Product received was exactly as expected. It was in perfect, new condition. The items themselves are very high quality and we were very happy to find this product."
5,Sweet,This is an awesome toy. I love playing with all of the figures and the price was very good. I am looking forward to buying more Lord of the Rings Action Figures!!!
1,Red Dog,"At first this book seems really great. It looks very innocent with a cute, red dog on the front cover that you imagine saving the day for a family in need. However; as you proceed towards the end of the story, extremely descriptive violence divulges. The horrible things that Pete says (he's a ""bad guy"" that tries to take the family's property with two other men and holds the family hostige in their own home, only to try to kill the father) to the terrified family are aweful. I can't believe anyone would want to read this book if they knew ahead of time that this type of voilence is in it. I refused to read these parts aloud to my child and frankly, if it weren't for the fact that our child had to read it to complete an accelerated reading assignment for school, I certainly would'nt have chosen to read it at all. Unfortunately, we were under a deadline and only had the remainder of the day to complete the book."
5,I show my love for my HP LaserJet by only using the real stuff,"Still feeding my beloved HP LaserJet 3800dn with only the real deal (both paper and ink) I can honestly say in the 6 + years I have been running this printer, I have NEVER ONCE had a paper jam or inking problem. Stick with the real paper and ink and I expect you will find the same results."
1,Regretting the purchase...,"I really don't like writing negative reviews but in this case I felt I had to. I purchased this 2 CD album based on my liking of Jason Lindner's ""Premonition"" album and the fact that I heard a cut from this recording on our local jazz/classical station ('The Five Elements and the Natural Trinity'). The other cuts on this CD, however, are disappointing. Repetitive, dull rythyms..uninspired solos..sloppy band synchronization. I 'exposed' several other jazz listeners to this album and their general opinions were much the same."
4,More gems from the vault,"Danko has always had that special joy and vulnerability in his material. This set is no disappointment, though he is less prominent in some of the tracks. Some are alternate takes of Danko/Band standards, but none are throwaways. The live cuts with Paul Butterfield are a welcome addition, especially the riveting version of Unfaithful Servant (with an incredible harmonica solo by Butterfield)."
4,Tracks from the vaults,"Cryin' Heart Blues is another collection of tracks from the Rick Danko archives. It's a mixture of 17 live and studio cuts and demos and old favourites as well as tracks not previously released. 'When I Get My Just Rewards' and 'Lay Back In The Arms Of Someone' are polished studio works while 'New Mexicoe' is somewhat looser than the released version despite the possible presence of Eric Clapton and Ron Wood - not a very distinguished version, I have to say, so the guitarists could be Eric Wood and Ron Clapton for all the difference they make.'Twilight' is in its compulsory second place in the running order and is a nice full band version. Among the live tracks 'Java Blues' and 'Unfaithful Servant' with Blondie Chaplin and Paul Butterfield both stand out and the CD is topped and tailed with two different live takes of 'Mystery Train'.There can't be a lot left to release from any of the Band archives but what there is still sounds pretty good."
4,Danko delivers the dankness,"Great cd of music,especially if you are a Rick Danko fan.He was a great singer and even though some of these tracks sound unfinished,I would rather hear Rick Danko(or Richard Manuel)sing the ABC's then almost anything else that passes for music these days.Some of these songs are better than others.""Cry another tear"" is a great song written by Blondie Chaplin and sung by Danko.Blondie Chaplin is a highly underated musician.Not many people can say they have played with both ""The Beach Boys"" and ""The Band"".He is one of them.Since some of these songs were intended for a never released Danko solo album this collection may not appeal to everyone as it was not meant to be released unfinished.For what it is, it definetley works.I would also reccomend his self titled debut album which was probably his finest post ""Band"" moment(Before they reformed without Robbie Robertson).This is a great release."
1,Will not screw together after a while,The old duck where the white tab holder screwed into the base of the duck was great. This one is not. It is a pain to screw together and fails after some time.
2,Too big for a spa.,"I bought this for a small hot tub. It's impossible not to overchlorinate with it. Although it's described as being for pools and spa's, it's really too big for anything smaller than a swimming pool."
4,Love the Duck,"We're very happy with this purchase. This is one cool duckie! He looks adorable in the pool, easy to load, and chlorine disperses easily. The duck has lasted at least a year and in Arizona the sun kills everything eventually, I've had other dispensers fail even before a year, so this is a tough duck. When he gets too tired to swim around anymore doing his job, I will definitely buy another one. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars was because of excess labels that were absolute misery to remove. The glue was super sticky & gooey so the labels didn't come off cleanly, but in strips and pieces. You don't want to put anything in a pool, like labels, that will come loose eventually and end up clogging the filters. I spent a lot of time getting the labels off and using a product (orange oil) to cut through the glue. The duck is great - please lose the heavy labels."
2,Derby the Difficult,"I am constantly having problems with this chlorinator. First, it is very difficult to screw the retaining ring back on after refilling it with fresh tablets. It takes me over 5 minutes just to screw it back on after constantly cross-threading it. After finally getting it screwed back on, it might stay on for a day or two before falling apart in the water. It seems very cheaply made at least around the thread area. I am going to replace it with a chlorinator that has a tube that screws directly into the base instead of this piston-type, retaining ring design."
3,Sinking duck,"The directions state you can put up to 7 tablets.in duck, If you put in 5 it will sink. Hole in top. When it gets low in water iit sinks. Takes a long time for it to drain out. Works fine with 4 tablets. This is second duck. First had 4-5 small holes in it. 2 nd works with 1/2 the tablets."
1,Terrible floater,"After a little less than two mos use, this duck no longer works. The top screws on to the bottom, which contains the chlorine--theoretically. However, it no longer screws together, making the duck useless. I also found out from my local pool company that this is a common problem with this device, so they quit stocking it."
5,Cute Duck in my POND,"It was delivered on time.The cute duck works very well in my swimming pool. It has been a very hot summer, my salt-chlorinator works very hard but the pool still needs more chlorine, and this cute duck helps that a lot. Plus, it floats around the pool by the water current so that it is a nice indicator on pool water circulation."
1,Does not last,"It worked great for about 2 months and them the duck part would no longer screw to the bottome which hold the tabs. I must attach correctly in order to float. Amazon is sending a replacement, but I would not recommend."
2,Richard Pipes at his best (or worst).,"The series of lectures comprising this book show Pipes at his 'best', clearly justifying critics views of him as ""among the most politically reactionary and intellectually unscrupulous of the ""totalitarian"" school of American Sovietologists"". This book provides a good counter-analysis to the works of Figes, Fitzpatrick and Service, showing an outdated 'top-down' approach to 20th century Russian historiography. A must for those who wish to see the product of America's cold war generation of intellectuals."
3,Could have been better,"The watch's appearance is excellent, but the quality not so much. Couple of months into use and the hinge broke. No repair and had to throw away."
1,Hard to identify plants.,There were not enough photos for me to successfully indentify even the few tropicals that I have. I feel you have to really know your plants to be able to decipher from just written descriptions what you have or would like to have.
2,difficult,"This book is lacking pictures. As someone who lives in the tropics I would have appreciated it if next to the plant names there were photos of the plant described. For the ""lay"" gardener I would not recommend this book. It did not help me in my search for plant names at all..."
4,Great little workout!,Easy to follow but tough in a challenging way! Great for toning! He has interesting info & is quite motivational!
4,"Effective, fun, and easy to follow","It is 35 minute weight training session, followed by a quick 10 minute cardio session. The weight training consists of bicep, shoulder, tricep, squats, lunges, and pushup. The 10 minute cardio can be done immediately following the strength workout, or as quick workout on it own. It gets the heart pumping, and I think really burns up the calories in conjunction with the first workout. However if in a bind for time, it would be okay on it own. Overall, its a quick and effective workout in 35-45 minutes."
3,weights,"this workout is okay if your feeling on the ""i want to do a slower paced workout today"".it's not a bad workout but i am used to doing faster paced and extreme workouts."
1,very disappointed in the level of workout,"I have read the reveiws for this dvd, and most are very good. I am one of the few that are giving it a low rating. I have done a mouth of the insanity workout with Shaun t and a few of the charlean extreme workouts. This workout doesn t even come in the ballpark of those workouts. This is a good program for people just above 'beginners"" A total body workout??? COME ON Your biggest muscle group in your upper body , is your back and chest. So you should spend more time and lift heavier weights in these areas. yet you work your bi s and tri s the most and use the same weight for tricept kickbacks as you do for one arm rows. Your biggest upperbody muscle group gets a little to no work. If you think this workout is advanced...do one of Shaun Ts insanity s workout, now thats advanced. Again good for medium fitness levels. I will bet alot of money, that Commander Tom didnt get his body from doing this workout!"
3,SWAT,"I have to say that this video is very effective. You will feel the difference and the burn when you are consistant with both of the SWAT Workouts. In the warm-up, I thought it went a little slow. I just didn't feel quite as motivated with the SWAT workout as I have with other workouts. Not to say that this is not a good video to use as I do alternate it with my other videos for variety. You will sweat and you will feel better after each of the SWAT workouts. But if you want motivation and excitement, you might want to try a different route."
3,"Not Greg's best, but still pretty good","This CD never really reaches the heights of _Dream Cafe_ or _Further In_, but it does have its moments. My favourites are the mellow folk-jazz ""Beatniks Gonna Rise Again"", the sublime ""People Hide Their Love"", and the vocals-so-schmaltzy-it-actually-works ""20 or so""."
5,"No ""crosswords"" for Amazon.","Being a California product also, I frequently enjoyed these crosswords in the Sunday San Francisco paper, and was happy to see Amazon carries the whole collection, of which I hope to get more volumes. Lest I be thought to be ""damning with faint praise"", I would like to add that these puzzles are delightful. Each puzzle carries a theme, and when you deduce the theme many of the clues which initially baffle one becomes clear. Each puzzle also contains clues that are puns, antonyms, synonyms and often just plain clever. Money well spent for hours of delighted amusement."
2,Marginally useful,"It is no surprise that there are 70 used copies of this book for sale starting from a penny. The book provides some interesting information, but it is very outdated and the author really did not provide anything other than common sense knowledge."
3,Okay-A little pricely,"We found other items for a lot less money that worked just as well. However, this product was okay. We should have done a bit more research."
4,"Works, perhaps not the best for alkaline soils though.","I recently purchased this and if you follow the directions it definitely works but I'm unsure if it's accurate, especially in my area which is quite alkaline. It says in the instructions that it may not take accurate readings in salty alkaline soils but that that won't be a problem because most areas have acid soils.... well not here we are quite alkaline. All my readings came back acidic 6.5 was my highest reading. I think I'll have the soil tested professionally and see how it compares. Even if it isn't calibrated properly it may still come in handy once I learn how far off it's reading I can adjust accordingly.Summary: Use at your own risk if you live in an area with alkaline soils."
3,Great Product but misleading,"This is a great product, however, I felt misleaded as it implies it is a ""soil pH"" meter and it is really an acidic soil pH meter. I thought it would test a wide range of basic to acidic soils. It tests from pH 3 to 8. The 8 is on the very far right of the scale and I'm not sure how accurate it would be. They should change the title to ""ACIDIC soil pH meter"" to be accurate. If someone was buying this product to get their soil to 8.5 they would be pissed off! Luckily, I'm trying to get my soil at 6.0.."
1,um...do not buy,"As a student of the game of pool, I've had the opportunity to read several books on advanced pool. However, this one stunk so bad, I had to do my first review to save the rest of you from my mistake. Trust me folks, this one is for the trash can. It lacks substance, insight, and might be a bargain at $.99. If you're interested in learning valueable information, getting your moneys worth, and not waisting your time...pick up a copy of Byrne's ""Advanced Technique in Pool and Billiards."""
4,Worth the money but less than expected,"The bulk of this book consists of Liber 963 itself (Treasurehouse of Images). This is one of the most beautifully stunning pieces of verse I have ever read, at once compelling, imaginative and detailed. This work is not published in many other places, and the books it is published in typically are out of print and demand high price tags. Therefore it is well worth the price of this book just to be able to have hard copy (in paperback, portable form no less) of 963. However, the description did lead me to believe that the other authors listed contributed significantly to this particular publication, which is not the case. There is additional material, but not very much and the additions consist of information easily found elsewhere. I would still buy this book over again, but it would have been nice to know the real value of the other contributed work."
2,Disappointed in Roxana,"I had high hopes for this collection based on the reviews given here. I was sorely disappointed, therefore, to find Sanderling's renderings of the Brahms Four totally lacking in inspiration (and by inspiration, I mean energy). Tempi are way out of line, leaving the wind players gasping for air and the string players crying for more bow. The third symphony in F, in particular, has an almost elegiac quality. One would hope that, given the slow tempi, Sanderling could at least manage to convey ""grandeur"" or ""majesty,"" but once again he fails to realize the beauty of this masterwork. My advice: keep looking for the definitive Brahms; it's not to be found here."
5,Brahms Symphonies 1-4 Sanderling,"This is a very good set of the Brahms symphonies. I highly recommend it to the serious Brahms fans. Having several cycles of these symphonies, this is the one to get."
2,Moderately Satisfied & Slightly Irritated,"The keyboard would be perfect if when it's placed at the higher levels (even w/ edge of desk or higher) it actually stayed. As soon as weight is placed on the tray, the tray drops down to almost standard tray level. I purchased it for the higher level because my desk sits to low for my comfort. Also, it's a pain to have to readjust the tray everytime I use it so I just leave it out because where I have it set it still won't go under the desk. Unfortunately this means I lean over my keyboard to work at my desk. I would have been better off spending the extra money on one that holds its position automatically."
2,Tray does not resist any pressure,"Even though this tray has a locking mechanism, I can not put any pressure on the keyboard tray via typing or mousepad use. The tray sinks! Even when locked. I've tried fixing it, but to no avail. I have to get a new one. Too bad--the tray itself and the track work well."
1,Stopped working 5 months after I bought it,"I purchased this product from Amazon: ""Kensington Expandable Keyboard Platform for Multiple Users with SmartFit System and Wrist Rest (K60066US)""Office Product; $151.10It stopped working 5 months after I bought it. It will not hold any position! Which makes it worth less than NOTHING!Kensington's Web site requires you to register an accont before you can email for help. I resent having to register in order to get assistance. I will try to call the company."
2,somewhat disappointed,"We purchased this air hockey table for our daughters for Christmas. Upon Christmas eve set up, the motor didn't work right away. Seemed it was a little hesitant, it did start working after several minutes of panic. Christmas morning, our girls were thrilled with their new game, played it right away- during the first game- one of the strikers chipped. A few games later, the other one started to chip also. I called the company for replacement, they said this is a big problem right now & will send me a new motor & strikers. Well they did send the motor, and only 1 striker. We need 2. The table itself is fine. Would I do this again- no. Now I have to call them again, to get another striker."
3,ice hockey,The ice hockey appears that it will be OK after it is replaced as it was damaged in shipping. The deliverman also left it outside our business for a day or two when it was closed. Fortunately it was not stolen.
3,Minnesota All Outdoors Atlas,"I bought both the Central & Northwest and Northeastern MN map books. The map book is SO close to being perfect and the thing that keeps it from being perfect is kind of hard to understand. Rather than print with a blank margin where the metal spiral binding holes are located they punch the holes in the edge of the printed map. Approximately two-thirds of the map edges are obliterated by the holes punched through and the metal binding blocks the remaining view. I found myself surprised just how often the area I was looking at was useless because of this. The maps themselves are awesomely detailed, but, this one super-flaw was enough that I returned them. If they ever fix this issue I would buy the maps again in a heartbeat."
4,Nothing out of this world but okay,"I'm using it on my little finger on my hand. It doesn't quite stay on as a toe ring, but it was cheap, so it is what it is."
3,ok,Skip this and go back to the whole set of I Love Toy trains. Thsi is more just a finale movie. The rst of the series rocks though.
5,One of his best!,"Newbury's mature voice sounds absolutely great on this CD. Jack Williams plays lead guitar and keeps perfect pace as Newbury sometimes takes the music in spontaneous directions. The violin, cello and mandolin add a special richness to the music."
5,Stonehenge Demystified,"This is the best book on Stonehenge. The text is concise and extremely well written and documented. The photos of the sites, stones and artifacts are beautiful. I especially liked the anciet time-line.Ms. Bernard answers the Who, Why and When about the constuction of Stonehenge. Anyone interested in archeolgy and problem-solving will devour this book.I am looking foward to more Digging in the Past Serries."
3,Pablo Neruda (Kindle Edition),"I am enjoying the content, but the Kindle version is a mess. It is filled with typos, repeated text, and sloppy indentations. Overall, pretty sloppy."
1,Cheap pieace of junk,"I bought this for my daughter. After spending over an hour trying to get it out of the box, it was then I realized I spent 70.00 on a piece of junk. The ONLY thing that works good is the radio. The doors are always falling off and so is the roof. You put the doors back on and they fall off again when you open them. My daughter still like it though even if it doesn't stay in one piece. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. !!!!!"
5,This Toy is great!!! Read mine and mine only!,"I think these people are trying to get this one toy a low rating or for some reason on purpose. I have the toy. 4 $100 or whatever expensive price, the toy is awsome. Me and my cousin have played with it rammed it off the stairs dropped it you name it we did it. The toy is really cool I think you will not waste your money. Especially because I have had mine since it first came out. Please people listen to me. I really can't say anything baf about it. The car really even wil fuzz out if you are not a a certain spot. You CAN change the station though. Listen the toy is great durable safe and really comes with a tiny but not real but COOL DRINK REFRIGERATOR!!.... and drinks too!"
2,mad at myself for buying this,"I bought this for my 8-year-old for Christmas. It was over-priced, but I figured it would be worth it if she really loved it. Needless to say, she never plays with it, and my 2-year-old has claimed it to stuff her Teletubbies in (at least someone is playing with it). The doors come off with little resistance, as well as the windshield, etc. My 7-year-old neice doesn't play with it, either. It is a hunk of junk (just like the spa) and all the kids play with are the dolls, not the accessories. Do yourself a favor, and just buy your kids the dolls and clothes, because that's all they play with anyway."
3,BRATZ rule!,"I know a lot of mothers are going to hate me for writing a good review for the BRATZ LIMO...my daughter got this at Christmas and on December 26th we put in the batteries, got all the BRATZ ready for prom, put on the radio and had a blast! Im 32 years old and for whatever reason I enjoy playing with BRATZ more than BARBIES(maybe I'm all-Barbie'd-out!) Yes, the limo is a little pricey, and to add to it you must have the FORMAL FUNK BRATZ to go with it, but ask yourself this: is it REALLY that much more than what MATTEL wants for BARBIE stuff?"
2,mamalou,"This was a gift for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas. We did not have problems with the doors staying on, however the front ""trunk"" does come off easily, as does the stupid review mirrors.The ""radio"" worked once, and now does not work again. Having said all of that...my daughter still loves it. I have no idea why, but she does. I am very disappointed with the construction of this toy, and would not buy it again had I known. I would have told her Santa can't bring this toy because it is a piece of junk."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE - Put 1 star in so it would take my review,"My daughter received this from her grandparents for Christmas. AS WE KNOW IT IS NOT CHEAP. My daughter is 7 and she asked us to take it back because it is a piece of ""JUNK"". This falls apart all the time. She was all excited after it was opened she could not even play with it and it went RIGHT back in the box waiting to be returned. The top comes off, does not stay on at all. Windows do not go up, seats fall backwards with dolls in it and doors do not align properly. A VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to all. I then called the Company yesterday morning and all they had to say was THANK YOU for the information and they will note it. What a horrible response for a companny. No I am sorry."
3,DO ANY MGA BRATZ ITEMS STAY TOGETHER???,"I continually say they will get better, I am continually disappointed and so is my daughter. We have the spa that we had to superglue together. We have the Disco that we had to superglue together. Now the limo - the doors fall off very easily, when you sit the dolls in the seats they fold back; The trunk lid falls off; The windows don't stay up. We've read the directions prior to assembling all Bratz items and have found nothing special that we are supposed to be doing. I find it hard to believe from some of the reviews that people are not experiencing these same problems. I've written to the company and receive no replies, I call the company and get lost on hold. The dolls are great, the clothes are great, but the accessories really are disappointing!"
2,This toy has no durability.,"We purchased this toy for our 9 year old. The toy has great detailing with radio, lights, seats and seatbelts. However, the doors and windows CONTINUOUSLY fall out. We have taped the pieces together so that our daughter can play with it. Our neighbor also purchased one and her daughter's toy fell apart also."
1,Can't Believe This Product is Even on the Market,"Bought this for our 10 year old daughter last year who gave up playing with it after it broke repeatedly about 20 times. All of her friends tried putting it back together, along with her parents, but to no avail!This toy is such a piece of garbage, I can't believe it is even allowed to be sold! And the price is ludicrous to say the least. Doors, hood, trunk, license plate - ALL fall off and does not stay put. Bottom Line - A real piece of junk! Don't waste your money."
1,Lowest of the low!,"We bought this limo for our daugther who is 7 years old. I spent a few minuttes cutting all the wires and plastic straps and realized during this process that these were the ones who kept the car in one piece. The limo fell apart a few times during this. My daugthers first comment to her new toy when she got was: ""Will they ever make a car that will stay together?"".We 'only' paid 15$ for the limo, which is the right price for these pieces of plastic, if not on the higher side. We will glue the front doors shut, which will support the roof, only draw back will be that the driver and co driver will have to get out through the top. We will survive. Will these people at MGA ever realize that what we want is NOT many features but DURABLE WORKING features? Check out the click connection between the hood and the hinge - I must admit it makes me laugh - however I do feel sorry for my daugther."
1,WASTE OF $$$$$$$$$$$$$$,"$79.99 for this toy??? You've got to be kidding me!! It is not even worth $9.99. The doors constantly fall off, the radio can barely keep a radio station in tune, the roof won't stay on, the seats fall out! We eventually just took off the hood, the trunk, the roof, the doors and the seats. It will be going in the trash before next Christmas. PLEASE don't waste your money on this piece of junk!!"
3,Well..,"This Bratz Limousine is fun for the Bratz to cruise in. I, personally, like it. And so does my friends. Not so durable, because if you mess with it, the doors fall off very easily. And the FM radio, is a new feature, which is very nice, but I suggest making a AM radio with it to make it more exciting."
1,WASTE OF 79.99$,i have to say i sware i would have written this way sooner but i diddnt have an account thie toy broke the first day i got it the dorr fell off the top wont stay on the dolls seat belts suck and yes they have the dolls drinking wine and alcoholic beverages wow what a great role model for the kids???my mom CRIED OVER THE 79.99$$$ WE SPENT SORRY LITTLE KIDS BUT REALLY SCREW YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DOWN WITH THE LIMO { WAIT IT ALREADY BROKE DOWN}!!!!
2,disappointment,"My 5 year old and 8 year old pleaded with Santa to bring this--what a disappointment! The hood, windshield, trunk and doors fall off far too easily--as soon as the car is pushed something pops off. The Bratz can't sit up all the way in the car and ride with the roof on and they can't wear their seat belts (while adults know that you don't wear a seat belt in a limo, this bothers kids who wear theirs all the time). When you stow the accessories in the bar they get lost inside the car--not good if the Bratz want a drink (let's not go THERE). Flimsy materials and packaging that took 45 minutes to remove made this one a bust under our tree."
2,very disappointed!!!!!,I bought this limo for my six yr old girl. She was so happy at first until she started playing with it. It fell apart even from the slightest touch. It was very difficult to turn corners. After a few tries my daughter became very upset and said please return it because it's a piece of junk and she was right about that[] it should not fall apart so easily. WE were both very disappointed. I plan to return it today.
2,Not worth the $$$,My daughter got this from my mother for Christmas. First-- it took forever just to get out of the box. 100 twistys and much frustration later we finally got it and just as the other reviews say it is very flimsy-- the doors will not stay on. My daughter loves everything Bratz and she doesn't seem to mind. I would say is a good toy for $20 but not $70
1,limo a laugh,The first time using this product afterthe enormous amount of time getting it out of the boxthe doors fell off and do not reattach securely againthe hood does not stay on either a giant piece of plastic junkall I can say is thank goodness I bought it on salebecause if I paid full price for this product what a shame.Terrible product and cant wait to return it!!
1,save your money,"i was very unsure about buying this for my 6 yr old because of the hefty price tag, but i got it for her and i am not happy with this purchase at all. it took me 30 mins to get it out of the box (and a slice on my finger) then when we set it up the top comes right off the doors come off and the reception sucks when we finally did find a station as soon as she pushed the limo it was all static again. i'de say save your money this toy is a big ripoff."
1,Not Pleased At All,"My daughter begged for the Bratz Limo for months. I purchased it for her as a Christmas gift. She was so happy to receive the Limo, but playing with the Limo was a nightmare. It kept falling apart, doors, roof, mirror, hood and windshield all this led me to take out my craft glue and glue everything. Its an expensive toy, It should have been built much better...I purchased the FM cruiser as well for my daughter and its way better than the limo quality wise. Now that all the pieces are glued solid, she enjoys playing with the Limo. I was so close to shipping the Limo back to the manufacturer."
1,Total Disappointment,My daughter got this for Christmas and it has only brought her a lot of disappointment. I wish I had read some reviews before we got it. The radio sounds o.k. but the first night it came on all by itsself at 1AM and again at 5AM waking the whole house. Next day it came on again when we were gone and ran the batties out. Now she has to put the batties in to play with it and take them out each time. She is so disappointed and so are we!!!!!
3,Another disappointing Bratz product,"Santa brought this to my daughter as a surprize present. She was so excited until she started playing with it. It is a great concept for the doors to be able to snap on and off, the only problem is they don't stay snapped on they keep falling off.The radio in it is okay - not great.I feel this could be a good product if the problems are fixed. Until then,I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase it."
1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday, we didn't even get it out of the box and the door fell off!!! We returned it the next day, hopefully the FM Cruiser is better."
1,Big Dissapointment,My Niece wanted this for her birthday and she wanted it so badly until she got it. Its another example of high price and very low quality. It kept falling apart. She played with it once and now it just sits there gathering dust. I wish I never got it for her and will not be buying and Brat playsets in the future.
3,I doesnt stay together,"First of all it took for ever to take out of the box, it had so much tape, ties and strings that it literally took 45 minutes to take out of the box. It is good that all doors, roof, hood and trunk come apart but the downsize is that they dont stay together, the roof is always coming off. Bottom line do not buy this toy is so expensive and my daughter lost interest the first day because the parts wont stay on."
1,I can't believe I bought this!,"My daughter absolutely loves her bratz, but I can't believe the pieces of garbage they continue to produce for these dolls, especially when you consider the price of them. My daughter has the limo, the FM Cruiser, the disco runway, and the spa. Unfortunaley she can't play with these items with out them falling apart. She spends more time putting the pieces back than she does playing with them. You would think that they would adapt the Snap and lock technology that Mattel uses on it's Barbie items. When you buy these bratz items don't forget to also purchase tape and crazy glue to keep your investment from falling apart on you."
3,it's pop,"this looks like my brothers limo from grad and it didnt have alcahol it had pepsi. so thats what i think it is in this. it is pepsi, not alcahol. sorry if i spelt a ton of things wrong."
2,"Flashy, but a HUGE disappointment!!","My daughter purchased this item with the money she recieved for her birthday. She was so excited and couldn't wait until we could get it all out of the box. She was SO.... disappointed! The car is constantly coming apart. The doors pop off, and are difficult for an 8 year old to put back on. The convertable top never stays in place. It reminds me of the toy company in ""The Santa Clause"" that chose to make the toy cheap so that people would keep buying more. Not this family!! The FM radio feature is very cool, but we already have a radio, and would have prefered a more durable car. My daughter decided to keep it instead of returning it, but it is now just used as a prop when she is playing with her Bratz.For the money and frustration, this is a toy that is better left ON the shelf at the store."
1,Lemon,We were very disappointed with the quality of this toy. It falls apart very easily and is not even worth $20 - let alone $80. Please do not waste your money on this one.
1,VERY Disappointed,"My family and I were amazed at how cheaply constructed this toy is.If you set the vehicle down on the floor too hard, everything falls off, the license plate, etc.Keeping all the doors and trunk on takes more than common sense, it takes more patience than I have for toy that I spent $60.00 on.I'm not a big fan of Bratz anyway because I think they promote unimaginative consumer teen culture with little clothing and less values, do they do anything besides shop, ride around with boys and call each other on their cell phones?"
1,This is the Worst Toy I have ever bought,"If I could give this toy zero stars I would.....This is the absolute worst toy I have ever Purchased. I bought It on a clearance rack to start with but you should be very angry at any amount of money that you pay for it.The cons-All of the Doors, Hood, trunk, roof of the car just snap into place. The Problem is that you can barely move the car without it falling all to pieces.The second big problem is the FM Radio-It worked for a full 10 minutes and that is with brand new batteries. No amount of resetting or trying different batteries has made it work.I am very angry that I paid any amount of money for this poorly made excuse for a toy. You would assume with it being a Bratz toy and the hefty price they put on it that it would be decent quality....very far from it."
1,DON,"There should be some type of law to protect consumers from toy companys who make junk and charge and an OUTRAGEOUS amount of money for it. We parents love our children so we tend to cater to there wants, and undoubtedly become blind sided in some instances, with this being one such case. My 10 yr old daughter couldn't play with the toy because it fell apart EVERYTIME she touched it. I can say this.... The lights worked, But I would much wrather buy a flashlight than pay this price for worthless piece of junk that only has working headlights. It doesn't even come with a Remote! The kids have to push the car for goodness sake! (which is impossible to do without everything falling apart in your hands)Parents pay attention to the reviews, this truly is not worth a penny!"
1,Total waste of money and disapointment for my child,"My daughter received the Bratz Formal Funk FM Limo as well as the Disco Runway. They are very poorly made of plastic. Everything falls off. The doors fall off the limo and my daughter became very frustrated trying to play with it. It is now in the top of the closet. She also received the Disco Runway, which was worse than the limo. The dolls would not stay on the runway. It is made of such cheap plastic, you cannot even put the whole thing together without something else falling off. It is also in the top of her closet in pieces. I e-mailed the company and they told me to send the merchandise back in the original packaging. Christmas morning is hectic, so we did not have any of the packaging. They said there was nothing they could do. I will purchase the dolls for my daughter, but I will not buy any of the accessories to go along with them."
1,Do you see what I see???!,I see a cup thing that has fake red junk in it... ALCAHOL!!!!Don't buy this.. Look at the picture with accesories and YOU WILL SEE! Ofcoarse I would expect this kind of thing from MGA. JUST LOOK AT THE DOLLS!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't like brats (BratZ?)...
3,Kind of cheap!,"I got this toy last christmas and I loved it. But on the next day, two of the doors broke of, when i wasn't even playing with the doors! I put the back on but it still falls of. So I just stoped playing because it is no fun to be playing with a broken toy. You should not waist $79.99 on a toy that brakes all of a sudden."
3,BRATZ ~OVER-PRICED AND NOT DURABLE,"I HAVE MOST OF THE BRATZ ITEMS. THIS LIMO IS OKAY, BUT LIKE MOST REVIEWS, IT FALLS APART AS FAST AS YOU PUT THE TRUNK, HOOD, AND ROOF ON. I LITERALLY HAD TO GET A PIECE OF SCOTCH TAPE, AND TAPE IT JUST ENOUGH SO THE TRUNK AND HOOD STILL REMAIN FUNCTIONAL. MY DAUGHTER WAS HAPPY WITH THAT SOLUTION.I ALSO BOUGHT THE BRATZ PAD, BUT I HAVEN'T HAD THE COURAGE TO OPEN THE BOX AND ASSEMBLE IT YET. WE ALSO OPENED THE DISCO THIS YEAR, AND IT WAS DISAPPOINTING ALSO. THE BRATZ BUS WAS PRETTY GOOD, WITH NO PROBLEMS YET. MY DAUGHTER LIKES THAT ONE ALOT.WE ALSO HAVE TO TACKLE THE BRATZ POOL SOMETIME THIS WEEK. WISH ME LUCK. HOPEFULLY THE BRATZ WINTER WONDERLAND, AND THE TOYKO DANCE AND SKATE SET WILL BE AS GOOD AS THE BUS, BECAUSE I BOUGHT THOSE AND PUT THEM UP FOR NEXT CHRISTMAS."
1,Limo of steel!,"I don't know what you guys are talking about,this thing NEVER breaks apart! I had so much fun cramming the dolls in the limo and putting the pieces back on! The Radio was so loud I think it made me deaf!This is a really great toy for your little daughter or granddaughter!"
4,Good Toy but not so durable,I got this toy for my birthday. Loved it. It is really fun to play with but there is one problem. If you push the doors out too much they fall off. But u can put them back on. This toy isnt very educational.
1,Highly Frustrated,"This toy is the WORST.It falls apart at the touch - and it is the flimsiest thing on the market - and for a whopping $80 - I expected more.My 8 year old NEVER plays with it; she became incredibly frustrated with this toy almost immediately.I contacted MGM about this - and their response was ""The parts are supposed to come apart easily""....and refused to consider replacing it with something of equal value...unlike Mattel - who I only had a problem with once - and they replaced the item I purchased.I know who deserves my money - and it's not MGM - with their lousy customer service as a perfect ending.I received no return on my investment. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"This is a big waste of hard earned money! The doors fall off at the slightest touch, the hood won't stay on and the radio cuts on by itself in the middle of the night! Don't bother!"
3,Not Impressed,"I am truly not impressed with this vehicle. First of all, removing this car from the packaging was unreal. Secondly, I realize that it turns into a convertible limo but when you attempt to put the roof back on, the pieces don't fit together properly. Lastly, the price that it is currently being asked for this product is totally not worth it. I purchased it at Christmas and caught a sale that I didn't think it was worth (...) it."
2,Rip Off!,"Not only is the limo overpriced, but it falls apart within seconds. You spend more time putting it back together than actually playing with it. It is impossible to keep the roof on with the dolls in it. Don't waste your money!"
4,Bratz Limo,"This limo is very cool. The limo plugs into the runway disco playset! It has an opening trunk\hood and almost every time i open the trunk\hood it falls off. this is an awesome toy but it isnt for crazy wild kids. The limo has opening windows and the top comes off. One more thing...when the top is on,the Bratz Boyz don't fit in the limo. I get really mad because i have to keep the roof off! When i play with the limo it doesent turn that well either. Well hope this was helpful!"
1,I DO HAVE BRATZ!!!,"I have plenty of Bratz. I have around 10 dolls, my sister does too, and our mom bought some for us to share. My neighbor likes Bratz and has the limo. My sister has the wildlife safari car. We played outside and had way more fun with the wildlife one. Next time I will play outside with the my scene limo and the bratz one and see which one is better. Please don't call me a ""stupid idiot"". I am glad you like my scene too. But if you would like to know, it is reviews like yours that make me dislike Bratz."
1,Please Don't waste money on this!!!,"Last year as a Christmas gift for my little sister I got her the whold formal funk set including the limo. She was so psyched until the ""contertiable"" roof broke off and same with the doors. My parents spent hours trying to put this toy back together but it just fell apart! Please don't do this to a loved one and make them going through the torture of waiting to play with a broken car! You wouldn't want to get a broken gift yourself! My sister was in tears the whole month because she wanted to play with it and it didn't work! Even the stero was horriable! You couldn't get recption! What kind of toy is That?"
3,Not So Good.,"When my friend got the limo for her birthday she loved it.After a couple of days though,she told me one of the doors came off,the roof wouldn't stay on,the seats fell out,the only think that worked was the radio and only one station worked well....it's fun to play with BEFORE it starts breaking."
1,Don't waste your time!,This limo is boring and costs too much. It only has a F.M. radio and the bratz don't look good in it. The limo is not fun at all. If you want a limo you should buy my scene goes hollywood party limo because:A. it is biggerB. it only costs $40C. it is more funD. it looks betterF. you an recieve a free mp3 player with ahe coupon and $5
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"Very disappointed in this toy and its quality for the money paid. Doors, roof, trunk and hood fall off too easy, just by a simple touch. Kids spend more time placing parts back on the limo than they do playing with it. After a few plays frustration sets in and the toy just sits there now. If you do buy, purchase some aspirin as taking out of package takes an hour at least. Tie wraps and plastic packaging way overdone, should come with directions on how to actually upackage product!!!! Please save your money and your sanity!"
5,A thorough introduction to avalanche theory.,"For backcountry enthusiasts with a science background, this book provides a thorough introduction to avalanche theory. The book is divided into chapters which build a solid foundation (weather systems, snow structure) through snowpack basics (snow strength and deformation, snowpack structure) and well into more advanced concepts (snowpack analysis, avalanche prediction, search and rescue, and even control with explosives, etc.) It is an excellent, if heavy, read and I found it a valuable resource in the development of an intro avalanche course."
5,Captivating and Well-Written,"Jessica Jones is a great character, drifting through life with an edge and a slightly self-destructive bent, trying to make it through each day. Bendis is a great writer. Not for the first or last time, he writes a book here that you don't want to put down once you've picked it up. Each of the three story arcs here are well-done.The ""adult content"" angle is not overdone, this comic isn't especially raw. He has fun with the ""Max"" label, tinkering around the edges of superheroes' sex lives. But you can definitely leave this one on the coffee table and not be worried about corrupting the young (there's no real nudity)."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A tale of a retconned in the cracks very brief stay Avengers member, and her inability to cope with sex, alcohol, and the city. If you can get past the big implausibility that there was an Avenger that nobody ever mentioned in the past 40 years, that was not The Sentry, then you can enjoy this tale of a former pink clad loser. This is definitely a Max title, and it opens with her shagging and swearing. Do not confuse this with the tv show please."
2,For beginners,"This book is visually appealing. It is well designed with good use of colour. There is a colour photo about every 4 pages, and illustrations, graphs and tables on almost every page. It is a hardcover book with proper sewn-in binding.It looks good, and covers the basics, but is generally un-inspired. The tendecy to talk in generalities and state the obvious becomes tedious at times. There are very few references to external information sources.Best chapter: preparing a business plan.Worst chapters: Employment, Exporting."
3,"Once more to the well, old chum","This, the latest entry in the Mallory series, is also the weakest. Not that first time readers would notice -- O'Connell is so darn good at her craft that even less-than-her-best beats most of the competition. Problem is, she was written a novel that ""fills in the gaps"" for her Mallory character while FORGETTING what made the character great in the first place. The ultimate peccadillo, even for one of O'Connell's rank, is to write a book that resonates only with those who have already fallen in love with the character because of earlier books. And that's what this is. Mallory is, as always, arrogant, dry and aloof. In this book, however, no one really cares..."
1,Vague characters in a predictable police drama,"What a waste of time and money! I bought this book per a bookseller's recommendations and don't understand what the hype is all about!The characters are never fully formed so you feel like they are ghost-like with no substance and no depth! I tried, I really did try getting into this but I sped-read the last half and then gave up...who cares what happens at the end when there is no character development and the storyline drags!If you want a good thriller, try Cruel and Unusual Punishment by Patricia Cornwall."
5,A Classic Mallory Novel,"This pageturner is less sentimental than the recent novels in the Mallory series, but shines more light on the character herself. At her toughest and grittiest, she is also more human and vulnerable. Albeit as obliquely as always - we rarely see the world directly through Mallory's eyes.This is a great addition to the Mallory series ... and the tantalizing ending has me hoping we won't have to wait long for the next in the series."
4,LEGO is CoOl !!!,This is the best lego i ever had. You take a while to get situated but then it is fun going on and on through the time
2,"Good Product, Bad Packaging","It does what it's supposed to do, works great, no preservatives that may or may not be harmful, depending on the study you read. But there's one huge flaw. I've purchased four cans and every one of them had a defective valve. They either stick and keep spraying after you release the button, or they leak, spraying/dripping out the side and making a mess. Or both.I've tried different sizes, purchased at different times in different states, so I know it's not just that I hit a bad lot. There are other brands that work just as well, but have valves that work properly. I'll be using those from now on."
5,Great product at an unbeatable price!,Was exactly what I wanted.Large bottle of Lucky You perfume and the price is the lowest I've seen anywhere.Great shipping price and so fast!Def recommend it!
3,"Descent scent for the price, but nothing special","The scent is my preferred cheap scent which I wear after I take a shower and know that I am not going anywhere. The scent disappears soon after and is just ok, but pretty good for the price I should say. I think this would make a great gift to a high-schooler."
5,Great deal!,"This was a Very good sale item, an it arrived so quickly! Great for every day use, scent is light and flowery. Huge bottle. Was packaged nice and neat"
5,Mild and Good (No long lasting effect in summer though),"I love this perfume. It is mild and smells amazing. I regularly purchase this perfume from various stores in Utah. But this time I ordered it through Amazon. It being summer, the perfume long lasting fragrance is effected. I am trying to figure out if it is the summer effect or the perfume not being strong. Will see."
5,"Nice, youthful!","I've been wearing Lucky You for several years now. I really like it a lot! I can't even tell you exactly what kind of scent it is... It's not flowery, it's not fruity and it's definitely not ""old lady!""It's fresh, like clean laundry and it makes me feel youthful! In fact, for some reason, it always reminds me of that Debbie Gibson perfume from the 80s, Electric Youth... With the neon pink spring in the bottle! Ah, the good ol' days!"
5,lucky review,I love this perfume. I've been wearing it for 10 years now!! This was a great deal as well for the perfume so I jumped on it! Thank for the fast and speedy service and the great product!!!
4,READ MY REVIEW!,"I thought because of the price that it wasn't the real bottle of ""Lucky"" perfume but a knock off of some sort. It's the real deal! Thank you AMAZON for your great prices!:)"
4,Awesome!,"I was really looking for a more sultry, smokier fragrance (I generally lean more towards that end of the scent spectrum anyway), but just got this on a whim because of the Prime shipping. I usually don't like spritzy scents like this, but it somehow smells amazing. Kind of like citrus + flowers + clean laundry, but just a little bit spicy and smoky. I wish the packaging was a tad easier to handle though (it really is just a heavy glass bottle), but all in all, its an awesome buy!"
5,Alot for you money!,I received it in a timely matter and it was well worth the money i spent on it. I have been a lucky user for many years and this the best deal I have ever gotten for a bottle of perfume. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!
2,save your money,nice smell but once you put it on smell is gone within minutes would not but this ever again
3,Lucky You by LB 200ml 6.8Oz EDT Spray Sweet Scent,"Lucky You by LB 200ml 6.8Oz EDT Spray has a sweet scent. I liked it but my boyfriend thought it was just ""ok""."
3,Love doesn't always last,"This is a great scent. You may just grow tired of it after a few months of use. It's definitely more memorable than your average, ordinary perfume. And it is nice to catch in the air once in a while. I just wouldn't recommended thinking this is the perfume you'll want to wear every day of your life. It can easily be overworn."
3,Not crazy about it,"Lucky you smell ls good but nothing to go wild about, well not on me anyway!!!! May just keep it to wear around the house"
3,Good,Great value for the size but we were never given a shipping conformation number and could not track it.
4,good purchase overall,"The scent is very light. But it's rather a nice air refresher to me than a perfume.(just because the scent is not my type, I was expecting some very sweet scent.) and the container is somehow cheap. But the price is low, too, it's a good purchase overall. and there is a pocket mirror as a gift from the seller, sweet!"
5,PERFECT!!,"I thought it was going to come as the spray or something, but it came exactly as pictured! i was soooo happy! can not believe this is such a low price. ITS MY FAVV<3 thank you sooo much for a great deal! :D"
5,smells so good,"i have loved this perfume scent for along time, i make sure my girl always has a bottle around for our date nights! highly recommend it."
3,Very adequate compilation,"I've had this set for over a decade, and over the years I've found more thrilling, dynamic recordings of the Italian and Scottish symphonies (#3 and #4). But as a low-priced introduction to Mendelssohn's symphonies, or for that matter to M.'s music, this set is perfectly adequate. In particular I wish to direct attention to Symphony #2, the infrequently recorded ""Lobesang"" for chorus and orchestra. The symphony is maybe an hour long and extremely gratifying to the ear, though I have no idea what all the singing is about, as I don't speak or understand German, and the lyrics are not printed in the CD booklet. Still, repeated experimentation has proved that this Masur recording of the ""Lobesang"" symphony is a foolproof soporific, if one sincerely wishes to doze off, but cannot (for whatever reason). This is not a backhanded criticism, either; I'm utterly serious and very grateful to everyone involved with the recording. If you are seeking music to relax you, look no further."
5,2007 Subaru wrx,"Fast shipping and item works with my 2007 Subaru. I was a little sceptical at first, didn't know if it would fit my year make and modle but it did and I'm very happy with the product."
5,Works perfectly,"At first, I thought the wires were a little lightweight, especially power and ground, but then I found that the wires were heavier gauge than my receiver (and the same or better than the car's wiring).The package had clear documentation for the wiring colors (which matched up with my receiver), so it was very easy and straightforward to connect."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this video a while back and was very disappointed. Everything is done to excess, it's sloppy and unrealistic, just overall not for someone truly trying to learn to apply makeup.A waste of my hard earned money and I resent that."
2,Not so great,"This is not your 'usual' instruction / tutorial on how to use Java. If you are a beginner...don't even look at it, if you are at the intermediate level, you are probably going to use java for something more along the lines of server side programming...not a swing application. I feel I wasted my hard earned money on this book. I did give it 2 stars however as the author goes through the logical design process of software engineering quite nicely in the beginning! Beginners...stick with either Sun books or something like Ivor Hortons book or Dietal and Dietal..."
5,Nicely done!,"This book is top notch from it's code examples, explanations, and listings to its design, layout, and typography. You learn Java while writing an application. The author really does teach you Java along the way and not just the Java needed for the app. He also goes further by including you in the analysis and design phases, not just implementation. One suggestion, get a reference to have at hand like Grant Palmer's ""Java 2 Programmer's Reference"". It'll satify your desire to explore some topics further."
3,Some Book CD code does not compile?,"I have been working with this book since October. I have had good success until Chapter 8. I have not been able to javac or java the code from the book. In these chaps, you are instructed to javac these programs [does that mean not to java them?] I have e-mailed Mr. Liberty with no repsonse. I have enjoyed working with this book so far [I've also worked with VB 6 Scr].This is an excellent book to learn beginning Java 2 but some of the instructions in the book could be a little more clear."
3,Starts out good,"I thought the author gave a good foundation to the project that was discussed. The explanation of AWT tools was the best of all the 7-8 books on Java I own.He did go a little too deep into the analysis process of program development. His chosen project (stock market analysis) was intended to use ""one of everything"" in the Java language but was too deep a venture for my liking.Que's web site does not provide source code for the book and so I am stuck with a scratched disk - Ugg!"
3,Has good features,"This book is not for a total beginner...would recommend something along the lines of the Java Tutorial or Dietel and Dietel. If you have some basic knowlege of programming java (intermediate), this book has a lot to offer in the use of understanding awt and swing. Not many books do a good job on building these 'applications'...although I've seen many examples of these types of applets. The beginning has some good software engineering / OOD procedure. Basically, if you want to learn how to make a neat swing app...using all java classes..(yes from scratch), then not a bad buy."
4,Starting from scratch,"This is one of the best books I have seen which covers the basics of Object Oriented development, program design and actual Java coding in such an easy to read style. I read the first five chapters from a hospital bed but did not feel lost by not having my PC to try out the examples as they were so well documented. Using a single example program throughout the book provides excellent continuity of purpose as the chapters unfurl but may put some people off buying the book if the end product (a stock market tracker) is of no interest to them - I would say that the techniques are more important than the program - I don't really want a tracker but I couldn't put the book down once I had started to read it. Many of the techniques shout out for further examples but these are freely available from numerous sites on the web - the book is large enough as it is. I would recommend this book to anyone ""starting from scratch"" as a good all-round primer."
5,Shows you the full picture of developing software,"Java 2 from Scratch is an excellent book. It begins at the beginning, taking you through analysis, design, learning Java, then actually writing the app. I think it's better than one of my previous favorites, The Tao of Objects. I've searched a long time for a book that shows the whole picture of creating software. There are plenty of books on languages, plenty on OO methodologies, etc., but this is the first that integrates the various disciplines. This is not a ...for Dummies book. It does seem to assume some experience, although I think a determined beginner could digest all the things presented. I would recommend it to anyone. If you should get stuck, you can post a message to the newsgroup comp.lang.java.programmer for clarification."
5,Best book to start with,"I think the best way to learn any language is to get a expert sit next to you and guide through all your problems in your learning process,the book accomplishes the same, It further goes ahead to guide you through a project in java, which would give you sufficient confidence in your real world projects."
5,Excellent Reference Work,I bought the 12th edition and the 13th is bigger and even better. Anyone considering trying to earn a degree via distance learning should consider this a must buy. It's about 400 large pages with information on well over a thousand different schools. So you can use it for your initial search for a school to narrow your choices down to just a few schools to start corresponding with. Or if you're already thinking of a specific school you may still want to get this book to look at what the book says about it. There's a paragraph or two written on almost every school in here. It could save you the time and money that might be wasted getting tricked by a degree mill. I think this book would also be very handy as a reference in a personnel office to check up on schools listed on resumes.
3,It work ok!,"Just like in other reviews the small pump is worthless. The larger one has better suction but it is not as great as some other have stated. However, it does work okay."
2,Not soo good,My I had my girlfriend try this out since she is into this type of thing. She says the suckers don't work very well and its hard to get the ring on to the suckers and stay on her.
1,Don't waste your money,"The small-mouthed vacuum bulb doesn't generate enough suction. The larger-mouthed one does better, but for me all of sized of the rings just rolled off the nipple."
3,Not that good,I wasn't happy with this product i didn't think it worked as well as it could. It doesn't stay hard at all. I guess this would work if you had bigger boobs
1,Waste of money,"I bought this thinking it would sesitize my nipples. Then didn't get a chance to use them for a few weeks, too long to sent them back for refund. When I did try to use them, they didn't work. The small cups wouldn't hold suction at all. When I tried the large cup and rings, the rings wouldn't stay on. They just rolled off my nipples. I am a male with normal size nipples and expected the smaller rings to hold tight, but they wouldn't even stay on. A waste of money.Pipedreams Nipple Erector Set"
1,Not for my Wife,These little nipple erectors were fun to try and that's about it. The cylinders are just too small to fit and do the required task. Don't waste your money on these.
2,so-so,you get what you pay for. not enough suction to make much of a differance. buy a cupping set if serious
3,"Good, but not his best","Greg Brown is definitely one of the best musicians out there, but this album does not impress me like his newer albums do. It is very a pleasant and light-hearted album, but it doesn't have the lyrical beauty and depth that albums like Further In or The Poet Game do."
5,A Very Special Recording,"His best CD and among my favorite CDs for over 10 years. Considering that I bought the album and then the CD and have over 1000 CDs and hundreds of old LPs -- well, come to your own conclusion."
4,Good product for the price,"I was surprised to receive such a good product for the reasonable price I paid. Most messenger bags I looked at were at least $50. I use this bag everyday for work and more. Nothing has broken, no zipper troubles, no tears, and there are plenty of pockets with a great deal of space. I am very satisfied with this bag and am glad I didn't spend more than twice what I paid to buy something that would serve the same purpose."
3,Pretty good but not great,"Within 5 minutes of receiving this product, one of the zippers had already come off due to defective stitching. It's probably a fluke, and otherwise the bag seems a great value for only $21. It does have a strange odor though, and my wife, who doesn't particularly appreciate strange odors, told me to return it and spend a little more for something a bit better, so who am I to argue?"
1,Not Good! Bad!,"dont even go here! if this cd were a wine, it would be a bottle to be laid down and avoided! this is some of the worst trumpet playing I have ever heard! this guy should look into a career at Walmart!"
4,Finally Season 5,"Contains 26 episodes, 24 episodes aired as season 5 and two episodes from season 6 (Cheating and Scavenger Hunt which hasn't aired yet!). My understanding is that the 26 episodes were all shot at the same production period but only 24 were aired as season 5. The episodes are also in a slightly different order than aired. Packaging is good, looks like a normal DVD production run even though it is a DVD-R (Manufacture on Demand). Disappointed that it is presented in Stereo and not 5.1 like the other seasons. The aspect ratio is 1.78:1 even though at the time of this review Amazon lists it as 1.33:1."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a cheap copy of Rules of Engagement, not the same DVD if purchased in stores. There is no material inside the DVD either, no way of knowing what episodes are on which disc. Lots of pauses when watching the first disc. Amazon shouldn't charge full price for a cheap copy that looks like it came from Netflix."
2,rules of engagement Season 5,"I love the program but the audio is poor and the product is neither CC or subtitled, all previous 4 CDs had a CC option"
2,"Rip Off of the ""Rules...""!","I made the mistake of buying this set directly from Amazon. It is nowhere near as good as the previous four seasons, as episodes are not in order and this set is simply 'manufactured on demand'. I suggest people wait until a higher-quality set is sold somewhere else. I am really disappointed with Amazon, in this case. I always trusted them... until now."
1,Burned Copies,"Was disappointed when I discovered they were copies, but when I saw I just bought it quickly without reading reviews or description I figured I was s.o.l. But what really bothers me now is as I'm watching the episodes are not in order...so far episode 3 & 1 are in each others place and 7 & 8 are backwards...I don't usually leave reviews but this really ""hisses"" me off."
1,"Bootleg, and a bad one","Purchased this DVD for my significant other. Episodes are in the wrong order, one episode is cut off several minutes short, and episodes from season 6 appear on the discs. Packaging is ok but is clearly not original. Discs also skipped. I love the show but I'm very angry that I purchased a bootlegged DVD from ""Amazon.com LLC"" so I'm giving 1 star. I will no longer buy any DVD's on Amazon. I'm sure it's very hard to detect bootleg discs from suppliers but Amazon has a responsibility to it's customers to ship original products and to NOT support piracy...especially for their own financial benefit."
4,Fool-Proof Panoramas...,"Great addition for those interested in photographing panoramas. Works like a charm. Easy to use. A bit heavy to carry around however, but strongly recommended."
4,"Works great, its not the weak link in the process....","Even with my small sony pocket camera, the system works great. The hardest part is dialing in the right offsets to get that pivot point properly placed. Through the use of a quick-detach plate I've got my head mounted to my 3 way pan-tilt as a leveler.The thing is solid as a rock, which is great. The weak link is the pano software which I'm yet to find some that works the way I expect it to."
1,Do not buy this!,The wood-like (compressed paper) parts are of such poor grade that I find it hard to believe they were ever used for an item like this. Several of the support struts cracked during assembly. The rubber or plastic (they appear to have the properties of both) teeth that comprise the junction where this contraption is supposed to collapse disintegrated when used. This item is an utter and complete waste of money. I am surprised no-one has filed a class action lawsuit for fraud.Harvard Roll-a-Score
3,Hard to assemble but not impossible; fun once you get it together,"I agree this is hard to assemble and two adults are required for most of the steps. It took two of us about 8 hours total. We broke it up into a few hours a piece, so it wasn't so bad. Some of the materials are flimsy and some of the black covering (like contact paper) for the legs and other parts was loose. Some of the holes weren't drilled all the way through the outer covering, so we had to punch them with screws. The assembly instructions are thorough and clear, though, so it's not impossible to assemble. When the box arrived, it was really torn and dented. I was worried the parts would be damaged, but they were okay.Other than that, it is fun once you get it together. I'd say you'd have to really love Skee Ball like I do to think that it was worth this amount of time to assemble. It may not be a great buy if Skee Ball isn't one of your very favorite arcade games."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased the roll a score machine for a fall festival at an elementary school. I was not expecting a lot for the amount of money that I paid for the item, however, it was far worse than anything I could have imagined. Extremely poor quality, missing & warped pieces, electronic score keeper malfunctioned...just to name a few. Needless to say we were not able to use it for our festival. The item was purchased Oct. 2 and I have yet to have the item picked up for a refund. Customer service at Amazon is not at all what I expected. Lots of run around..not a lot of help. This is my first purchase through Amazon...probably my last."
1,"Disappointing product, great seller!","First of all, I would like to say that the seller was great to deal with and was very professional but the black overalls were a horrible disappointment. They were washed on a gentle cycle,according to manufacturer's suggestion and just shredded in the wash! They just absolutely fell apart into tatters...literally just shreds. However, the seller immediately suggested a replacement after I e-mailed with the problem and got the different overalls out very quickly without any hassle. I would gladly buy from this seller again but these black overalls were a complete and utter waste of money."
2,"Nice initially, but didn't last.","These were great for the first six washings or so. Unfortunately, there's now a big rip near the front hip -- came out of the washer that way -- and the color is rubbing off on everything. Even the daycare teacher complained about the black fuzz and stains. They're cute, but he's at an age now where he's not outgrowing everything so quickly anymore; it's time for clothes to last at least six months. These don't cut it."
4,International intrigue!,"Fascinating spy story about the search for a long missing (stolen ? I can't remember) chemical formula, developed by the late Chaim Weizmann (a chemist who became the first president of Israel), which has the potential to make petroleum out of sweet potatoes -- and thereby completely change the world, shifting wealth and power from the oil rich Arabia to impoverished Africa. Yes, it is ""dated"" in the sense that the plot is clearly influenced by the 1973 oil boycott. But if you like reading other ""dated"" mysteries, i.e., those whose plots no longer reflect present worries -- Graham Greene's Ministry of Fear (haunted by the Nazi menace), John Buchan's 39 Steps (German infiltration of England in WWI), the whole medley of cold war thrillers of Eric Ambler and indeed some of the early John le Carré-- that should not put you off of this well-written, well-plotted romp."
2,Not very good,"The subject seemed intriguing, but I simply could not read more than 20 pages... I still love this author, and may just reread his other books to recapture my delight with his stories."
4,quiet little thriller about high oil prices,"This book is sadly out of print. Written in 1976, after the first oil crisis, it describes the travail of high global oil prices. One of the characters is a Jewish chemist who apparently discovers a way to get cheap oil via solar energy, in the form of photosynthesis, if I recall correctly. One motivation is to reduce the dangers to Israel from hostile Arab neighbours, who are garnering huge oil revenues.The story is written as a spy thriller, with several scenes in Israel. I shan't give away the conclusion, but suffice to remark that the book shows Davidson's typical skill. Compared to Fleming's works, it is more cerebral. No spectacular high speed chases etc. Which is perhaps why the book was never a big hit when it came out, and has not been reprinted."
4,"Fascinating historical novel, in British writing style","I loved this book which details the personal ascent of Chaim Weizmann organic chemist, Zionist and long-time president of Israel who directed the Weizmann institute in Rehovot. The story is a thriller, but that's not the satisfying part. I enjoyed the descriptions of Chaimchik's presidential mansion, the layout of the institute, the threads of lost research conclusions. Lionel Davidson is an excellent prose writer with clear, resounding descriptions animating the feeling of London, Israel and the early 20th century.I recommend this, in fact I wrote so many notes that I am buying a second copy. Also, check out Davidson's other books on Israel, Tibet, Siberia, England, Scotland, etc."
5,Must have for boaters.,This is a great little reference guide for all boaters. You can get an answer to almost any boating question.
3,Good for the novice,"We enjoyed reading this book, but it wasn't what we had hoped. It is a better learning tool for the novice. The entries to the book are written in a alphabetical format. For example, entries about 'sails' are under S. We hoped it would be more of a non-fiction story form where one sailer's knowledge can help other sailers undergo new adventures. You'll read it once and then leave it on the shelf."
5,Bluewater sailor,"Great book. Interesting and very funy. When you sail for a while you notice that things like the ""black Box"" described in the book are true. Very good advises...good companion if you planning bluewater sailing."
4,Practical and Eclectic Knowledge,"John Vigor's ""The Practical Mariner's Book of Knowledge"" is a solid reference book for sailing information. The book is full of entries (420, arranged alphabetically) about sails, waves, knots, keels, and countless other subjects.But not all of the entries are that practical and useful: entries on the constituents of ocean water, horsepower generated by humans, the distance of the sun, and ""rules for yachting writers"" show that this collection of knowledge is often more eclectic than practical.Overall, this is a worthy addition to a library of sailing books, but it is far from a must-have book. Most of the information in the book can just as easily be found (without Vigor's occasional humor) with a quick Google search."
3,Bought it as a gift.,"It doesn't keep stuff very cold, even when plugged in for days.I mean, it's OK for drinks, maybe. But I won't leave insulin or a tuna sandwich in it."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this fridge two months ago. Now it stop running. I chose this one, because I expected it would be a quiet fridge and do its job. But it's not that quiet either.This is my second Sharper Image item and it will be my last one."
2,Not Worth it,"This is a nice looking, small unit that works OK, at best. My three year old unit just died. That seems a little short to me. Also, it does a poor job of keeping thing cold. In fact it doesn't. It will keep them cool, but not cold. Food spoils noticably faster in this fridge than in a normal compact unit. Sodas are not kept cold. To give you an example of the temperature...I keep 20oz bottles in it at work. Before I drink them I place them in the larger office freezer for about 25 minutes to get them cold. They are not frozen even after 25 minutes in the freezer."
3,Just OK,"The first one I bought stopped working after 2 months and Sharper Image was very nice and replaced it. However, I must say that I find this fridge to be quite noisy when cycling on. Sounds like a blow drier on low. This has been the case with both of the fridges. I think a small conventional fridge is quiter that this one, but the space saving features make it attractive."
4,A good introductory Persian lesson book.,"This is better than Thackston's ""An Introduction to Persian"", which can be forbidding for beginners. It differs from Thackston in that it's emphasis is on spoken Persian rather than written Persian. However, having said that, neither book really does much to teach you how to read or write. They should be viewed more as refreshers and practice guides. Also, Rafiee's book comes with a key to the exercises and a cassette to aid in pronunciation, which Thackston's book lacks."
3,Needs better editing,"A self-teaching book should be user-friendly and not leave the reader thumbing through the vocabularies to find undefined words. Unfortunately, this book violates that rule in the very first chapter. However, I think it is in some ways a vast improvement over most other Persian books, which are either too scholarly, too dry, or too simplistic. This book falls somewhere in the middle, and with a little careful editing it may become a four-star or five-star item."
1,truly crummy,"This has to be one of the sloppiest excuses for a language text that has ever made it into print. In exercise after exercise, you are asked to use words that are not provided in the vocabulary and for which the only option is to look up the answer in the key in the back. The trouble is, some of the words in the answer key aren't in the glossary either, so even if you can memorize a sentence you are still left wondering what the individual words mean and how and when they are used. Has nobody at Routledge ever heard of proofreading? This is such a shoddy piece of work that I would seriously consider giving it zero stars if that were an allowed option."
4,Improved from last edition,There are many improvements from the previous version; the vocabulary and dialogs are a bit more up-to-date and better reflect the rhythm and humor of Iranian conversation.
4,Wonderful introduction to spoken Persian,"This book is a wonderful introduction to spoken Persian, and so far the best in the market. It is a pity the book doesn't go much deeper into the language, but it covers a great deal of Persian grammar and vocabulary, stablishing a great base to start learning literary Persian and going further into the language. The dialogues and recordings are superb and it helps very much understanding real Persian. Also there are many helpful exercises after each lesson and a good in-depth introduction to the script, which is used along with transliteration all along the book, thus helping the learner mastering the script and developing reading skills. I wish a second part of this book was released, I would definitely buy it."
3,anyomonous,i have to say bratz are great toys and so are myscene so keep your feelings to yourself ok. because all you are doing nothing but stupid childish JUNK.and i dont think it is fair ok.so stop NOW.THE TOY IS OK I GUESS THANK YOU
3,Thank you MGA!,"Frsit of all, I wanna thank MGA for creating such a boy. I don't reely like Koby and I don't have tha dol (or any Koby doll). I used 2 thak he was dum but now I reelize how much he has accompolished! I must complement U 4 Koby. Thanks!(oh, by the way, my cousin has this doll-not have bad!)"
5,AMAZING COURSE IN MIRACLES GLOSSARY,THIS GLOSSARY IS VERY HELPFUL IN FINDING ALL THE HUNDREDS OFTEXT SPECIFIC MATERIAL. GO RIGHT TO THE COURSE IN MIRACLES BOOKAND THE GLOSSARY HELPS ME FIND EXACTLY WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR.
5,From Mike Joyce of The Washington Post:,"Recorded long before Hurricane Katrina tore up the Gulf Coast, ""Guitar Gumbo"" is Tom Principato's love song to Louisiana, a multi-track celebration of it's culture, mystique, and allure. As always, Principato's Fender-charged fretwork generates lots of Stratocaster sparks and Telecaster twang, along with some fiendishly syncopated runs on Professor Longhair's ""Hey Now Baby"" and other tracks. The self-penned instrumental ""Return Of The Voodoo Thing"" quickly stands out on the album, as does ""Louisiana (Been Callin' Me),"" which features Tommy Lepson on Hammond organ and the Nighthawk's Mark Wenner on harmonica. As the albums title suggests, though, not all the tunes evoke Louisiana sounds. ""Tango'd Up In The Blues"", is one of Principato's most sensuous and atmospheric compositions and David Kitchen's ""If Love Is Blind"" introduces a roots-rock, boogie-woogie powered diversion. Mike Joyce The Washington Post"
2,The ballpoint version is better,"I had the Dr. Grip ball point version (sold on Amazon as the ""Pilot Dr. Grip Center of Gravity Medium Point Black Ball Point Pen"") and loved it, so I figured I'd get a second one to keep in my bag. So I picked this one up and while the gel ink writes nicely so far, it doesn't have the weight and solid feel to it that makes the ball point pen so great. This actually feels like a pretty cheap pen, which it's anything but. I'll hang onto it, but next time I'll make sure to get the good one."
2,disappointed,"I love the grip of these pens. I have used this type of pen for a long time. However, this pen had something wrong with the ink. It didn't come out well. I had to buy a refill and replace the ink."
1,Waste of money,"I love the fact that I can refill with my favorite ink and wanted a sturdy, comfortable pen to write with. In one week, the pocket clip broke off! with regular use. The barrel of the pen is a nice metal, but the clip looked like it was glued on to a cheap plastic ""rivet"". The biggest stress point of the pen and they ""half-assed"" it. The throw away Pilot pens last longer than that, and the are about ten cents a piece. Fix that issue and i would give it five stars."
5,Great,Favorite pen. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. 10 more words. Love it Love it. Love it. Good.
2,Ink delivery flawed,"Had several of these pens, and they all had the same problem. The ink just wouldn't get down on paper no matter how I held the pen. It would work normally for a couple of sentences, and then would start only delivering the ink intermittently.Would not buy again"
5,"If Iowa has a soul, his name is Greg Brown","The Iowa Waltz is my favorite Greg Brown album. If you grew up in an Iowa small town, you may think it the best album ever made. When the record first came out, there was an attempt to make the title song the Iowa state anthem. It never succeeded, alas. If I could vote, I would pick ""Out in the Country"" a lovely meandering groove of a song that makes rural Iowa in the summer seem like a dreamy corner of heaven."
5,Just look at the cover,"If you like the cover, and know nothing else of Greg Brown, then all you need to know is that he plays songs on guitar that reflect the sentiment depicted by the cover. No further pile of words need be thrown into this. If you like the album cover, and like down-home sentiments in folk song, well, Greg's the end of your search. Your search afterward is to attempt to find people like him. Good luck."
4,Monsters,"For anyone that has a child afraid of monsters, this is the book to buy. I have bought this book for three different children and they have all loved it."
3,good book,"Entertaining, funny book about a serious issue for parents. Definitely worth a read, especially if your child is afraid of the dark and monsters under the bed."
1,Will not read this to my children,There is no monsters!!! This book will make your kids think there are really monsters living under their beds. Bad idea!!!
2,Blacklight? Orange? Tireflys,"I like the tirefly brand in general. They have a good lifespan (just good), they don't break, and you can replace the batteries for CHEAP if you also buy those on Amazon.These, however, are not that bright, and I think the maker was a little confused about what color they wanted. It seems like there is a purple LED (not really black light) inside of an orange case. The result is a pretty dim, orangey/purpley light. Don't let the picture on the box fool you; they're not nearly bright enough to turn your wheel into a circle of light."
3,Great For Kids,"For younger kids that this Disney Sing Along Songs video is aimed at, I thoroughly recommend it. They get to see Dalmation dogs and sing along to classic children's songs. Adults can feel free to watch it with their kids or let their kids watch it by themselves. Either way, fun to be had."
1,Not good enough 2 b a sing-along song!,"My baby brother thinks this is a good movie, but that's because he's a baby. Real sing-along songs play different songs from different movies, and Pongo & Perdita doesn't even have that ""bouncing ball"" that every other Sing-along songs tape has. All it is, is a grown-up singing songs with her dogs and a bunch of kids. That movie reminds me more of ""Kidsongs.""Babies love it.....Older people know better!"
1,Little Bit of Violence,The First Time I ever wacthed this video I found out it had a one part of violence. It's when the kid throws the baseball and it bonks Bobby in the head and he falls down and hits his head on the hard floor. If you want to buy this video for your child. and you see that violence. never watch it again.
4,classic songs and adorable dogs,My 2 year old loves this video. She asks for it every day calling it the puppy video. The dogs are really cute and the music is upbeat. You will be singing take me out to the ballgame for hours afterwards!
5,"Quick, Small, Perfect","I bought this item in a store when I first got my camera. It is incredibly fast, doesn't get hot (like some others I have used), has a protective slip to make sure you don't jar the card, and is sleek and pocket-sized so it is perfect for travel.Highly recommended!"
1,Adorama - Watch the Shipping Costs,This is a further review regarding a circular polarizer filter I purchased from Adorama. I wrote noting the shipping costs equaled the cost of the filter.Adorama then contacted me stating they would refund a portion of the outrageous shipping fees if i would change my rating of Adorama. I rated Adorama higher -- then never received the credit I was promised.I will never shop with this company again.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"This USB adapter will cause your sound card to stutter in a horrible manner. Many users on the netgear forum are reporting this issue and NETGEAR is not fixing this problem.This is not a problem with XP/Vista IRQ conflicts (I went through the process of verifying this myself, which requires me to re-install XP to get my hyper threading support back). This is 100% a NETGEAR issue."
3,"So far, a struggle... ...a return is imminent","After two weeks, it is impossible to determine if this unit is any improvement over my laptop's built-in 54G adapter. I have the unit paired with a Netgear WRN854T router (a matching RangeMax Next unit), but to date have not been able to coax markedly faster file transfer speed. I am also suffering WORSE audio/video transfer with the WN121T - pauses and stuttering which did not occur with the internal card.So far, Netgear's tech support has been unhelpful - despite upgrading the router and adapter to the latest firmware, drivers and utilities, performance remains uninspiring at best. Perusing Netgear's support forums (which I suppose I should have done prior to purchase) shows many people having the same problems and getting no solutions from Netgear.Bottom line - don't rush to buy this product!"
3,Works OK with some limitations,"The adapter works OK at 130mps. Does not maintain a signal at ""N"" speed two rooms away from the router in a normal house. It also only scans channels 1-4 so you have to set the router up to only broadcast on one of those channels. Other than that it was easy to install. I have not noticed any of the issues mentioned regarding the sound. The computer is a new H-P mini case and it may have different drivers on it. It is running XP Pro SP2."
1,Junk,"Ever since I got this adapter, my computer has been randomly freezing up and crashing. I've narrowed it down to this adapter as being the source of the problem. I've done all the trouble shooting I can do, been to Netgear's site, updated drivers, etc., etc. The problems still exist and Netgear's customer service is nonexistent.There's too much competition in the market for products and service of this quality. Maybe this adapter won't give you any problems, but I'd avoid the headaches and try another brand."
1,absolute garbage - Do not buy or waste money,"Not only is the signal horrible, but the drivers are something I have never seen before. The Device manager was actually recongizing this as netgear,and when I rebooted it recognized it as some other brand I never heard of. After trying the CD that came in the box, then uninstalling and downloading software and trying that, I had spend HOURs installing this. I am not new kid on the block either. The software is so buggy, I spend days on this piece of junk. I hope I never see one of these again as long as I live. Just doesnt work!"
3,fast wireless,this is a usb type wireless adapter. it works with the n type of router. i did see a significant change in speed even with my netgear etreme rangemax router. dodnt have a mimo router yet.however the area of coverage is no better thn any other basic adapter.if you have a desk top then you can get a wireless card for about 20 bucks. these cards have the same area of connectivity. no change when i compared mine.yes the speed is better.
1,sound,like one of the other reviewers stated.. I too have had this item screw up my sound. i cant listen to music with out it studdering... shame on you netgear!!!
3,Huh?????,"One of those movies that is going to average two and a half stars because most people are either going to love it (5 Stars) or hate it (1 Star). Rather confusing for the average movie goer, but if you really like to sit down and pay close attention you may enjoy it. Not a movie for a large group. Surprise ending not that surprising. Many viewers are just going to say ""What? Huh?? I don't get it!"""
4,Graphics Card,"I instralled this X1300 into my computer. It has performed very well and so far there have no problems. Is is becoming hard to find he X1300, so if you see one I suggest get it. The proce is right fir it too."
4,Very authoritative account on Union scouts,"While the writer isn't as smooth as some of the better known Civil War historians he makes up for it and then some with an enormous amount of detail and research. He makes a special effort to puncture (effectively in my opinion) the rather fanciful legion of Mosby and contributes important insights into Union scouting operations, bushwackers in WV, and interesting personalities like Crook and Sheridan."
2,Too much opinion,"When I purchase non-fiction material and too often the statements are not upheld with facts I become defensive. I do not find the mixture of fact and fiction helpfull in withstanding a historical debate. The author seems all too ready to reach his hand in the information grab bag and discard information that doesn't support his opinion and hold fast to that which does. I was not entertained and saying ""wow that was interesting"", instead I found myself saying (why is the word ""probably"" used excessively in a book that is trying to spout off facts? To me this sounds like someone trying to slip into a popular and high profile subject and say ""I bet you never heard this before!"" History may be forgotten but it never changes. A good example to the author would be Mosby's own book defending Stuart in the days leading up to Gettysburg with actual letters and dates. (what a concept!) This is another book of ""eat the chicken and throw out the bones"""
2,Don't listen to this often.,"The tracks on the album in French are worthwhile, a lot of the synth-punk tracks are quite abrasive and painful to my ears."
1,could not finish this one,"Actually, I couldn't make it past chapter five. The heroine is nosey, bossing, and irritating. The hero could have been interesting but I didn't have the mental strength to hang in long enough to find out. There are too many Characters (and I meant that to be capitalized) already. I regret missing the hero's little daughter and her stuffed rabbit Buttercup but I've too many other books yet to be read to waste anymore time on this one."
1,Too many Characters and not enough plot!,"This book was not fast paced enough for me, it just lagged 'on and on and on'. I did not like Julia at all, she was just nosy, snoopy and asked 'question, after question after question', until I felt like telling her put a sock in it, already. There was nothing about her that was endearing.Chance was just,'there'... rather colorless! And how he fell in love with Julia's personality, I will never know!He would have been better off buying a Parrot, at least he could have put a cover over it's cage to shut it up!And the story... as with 'ALL' the too many Characters... fell flat. Library maybe, buy it no."
2,BMX,Bought this game for a 9 year old. He didnt really like it that much and rarely plays it. I am not sure if this is b/c he is too young or if the game just doesnt hold his interest.
5,Only Curl Product I will ever use,"This is literally the best curl product out there. Nothing else even compares! I have tried literally everything to tame my long frizzy/curly hair and nothing works near as well as the curl amplifier. Using a diffuser is key after putting it in your hair though. I can't say enough good things about this stuff, I love it!"
3,Does what it says....,"Def. amplified my curls and gave them definition. However, I didn't get enough volume as I typically like. I felt that it weigh my curls down a tad but but would def. keep using unti lthe bottle is finished. However, I HATE the smell. It smells a little fishy."
4,Pretty Darn Good!,"You know, after trying so many products that are healthy for your hair, but not always getting the best end results, it's refreshing to find something that actually does what you want it to and can be found at any number of local stores. This product is pricey for the amount, but you really don't need much; TIGI doesn't play, they know what they're doing. The Curl Amplifier works really well, even on my highly-textured, curly hair (African American). I gave if four stars instead of five, because I'm big on putting healthy things in my hair, and this doesn't have all the healthy ingredients I prefer. However, for strictly styling purposes, this works wonders and besides, I can always combine this with any of my natural products... which I have also done with optimum results!"
5,Simply the Best!,"Having curly hair is a blessing and a curse! I have gone through countless bottles of gels, sprays, serums, and mousse until finally I found the best product for my curly hair--Curls Rock. One pump is all you need for perfect, non-greasy, soft curls."
2,Dont understand the hype of this product,Bough b/c it got so many great reviews. I have no idea why. Used many other products that work much better.
3,Informative but preachy,"Gratz and Mintz bring some interesting perspective to the study of urban renewal. The professional consulting experience brought forth by the authoring team provides some actual know-how about solving urban problems. The book's major drawback is its almost remedial preachiness. Oftentimes, the narrative is interrupted by the authors' lessons - lessons that are frequently placed in italics so as to ensure the reader does not miss their point. Personally, I enjoy forming my own opinions and conclusions based on an author's text; this book does it for you. Overall, not a bad book, still fascinating and impressive in the authors' knowledge of actual city circumstances. The research behind this work is very good."
3,needs an editor,"This book is disappointing in that the content is well-researched and important, but the organization is quite poor. It just rambles all over the place. I would suggest picking up a copy of Suburban Nation or something by Calthorpe or Moe, for more user-friendly tomes, and of course it is always helpful to reread Jane Jacobs and Christopher Alexander (Pattern Language)."
4,An Excellent Read about Aftrica,"I have read stories about Africa before reading Thomas's collection, but I was very touched by her imagery and her autobiographical themes. Her writing reflects her creative use of language as well as creating rich images. At times, I felt like I was there with her. I would highly recommend this book if you have an interest in Aftrica and the mystique the Continent. I especially appreciated her writing about Ethiopia and the challenges facing the people. The writing flows."
2,"Decent, but nothing special","I'm rather picky with my mechanical pencils. For the same price on Amazon, you can get the Pentel Graphgear 1000, which is far more durable, is made entirely out of metal instead of plastic that looks rather cheap, and doesn't have lead breaking off every few minutes.I bought this pencil as a replacement for a PhD pencil that I lost recently as a quick fix. It's okay, but it honestly performs the same as a much cheaper 0.5 mm pencil. Seriously, get an Uru Toga or a Graphgear 1000 or Kerry Sharp because this isn't worth the money. It looks cheap, the lead advances too much, the lead falls out easily, the shake weight is incredibly irritating after a while so I just removed it.I like good pencils. This wasn't a good pencil.I'm out."
5,Perfect for school!,"This shaker pencil is absolutely wonderful for school. I bought this at Staples in my town in the pink color. I am so happy with my purchase! I highly recommend you get one too. If this isn't your favorite color, search around! Maybe you can find the color you want at a better price. Good luck!"
4,A lucid and understandable explanation of difficult material,This book offers an historical perspective of the evolution of modern Physics ans Cosmogony in a way that is interesting and understandable. A bit harder to read than Carl Sagan but well worth the effort.
4,A great tour of the universe as we currently know it.,"Timothy Ferris writes in a clear style that presents the latest scientific theories of the universe in an accessable manner. Best of all, however, are his final two chapters. Having dealt with the latest scientific theories on the universe it is nice that he is brave enough to tackle the question of God and our place within the universe - his speculation on the subject is an interesting read."
2,Very weak science,"I agree completely with M J Edelman's review. He gave it 3 stars; but, despite skillful writing, I can't give it more than 2. I'm a mathematician with a strong background in physics, and very much agree with Edelman that Ferris is simply repeating a lot of what he has absorbed, much without understanding it well. I was led to believe from the Amazon profile of Ferris that he was a scientist -- that's a natural conclusion when he is credentialed as an emeritus professor from U of C Berkeley, who has taught astronomy at 4 universities. But he isn't a scientist at all; he has only a bachelor's degree in journalism."
4,For the Lahman,"Timothy Ferris's book, -- The Whole Shebang is a book that explains the search in science for an ultimate truth. I particularly enjoyed this book because I like the way Ferris explains the information in my language. I am not a scientist nor a scholar, and you need not be either to be able to understand this work. I enjoyed The Whole Shebang and I encourage those who are as science illiterate as I to read it also.Sincerely, Kevin Roth Student Lower Columbia College"
5,Building Skin-on-frame Boats,"This is an excellent text for those who are interested in building their own ""baidarka"" or greenland style kayak. The text is interspersed with history and advice on technique as well as construction details. This is a must-have if you are planning on building your own kayak or ""baidarka""."
3,ok,"Good book. Many of the illustrations seem to be of the more obvious points while leaving the harder to follow instructions kind of obscure. It is often difficult to separate the instructions from the commentary. Not the easiest to follow, but very interesting."
1,toner flaked and cracked when printing graphic images,I couldn't believe how terrible my images printed on this paper - full of cracks and flakes. I printed the same exact pages on the hammermill color copy paper and it was beautiful. So I'm tossing the gloss!!
1,Poor Paper,"I'm sorry. I just don't understand the good reviews about this paper. Granted, it is very cheap, but it doesn't hold ink well at all, and the colors appear dull and lifeless. The ink smears all over the paper, and causes a rippled effect because of the poor and thin texture of the paper. It might be useful for just simple black and white graphics, but anything with full color is unusable. I purchased this paper to use for a 2-sided brochure that I had designed, and it is AWFUL. The colors are dull, they bleed, and there is no way you can print it 2-sided.....the paper is too thin to go through a printer twice. It simply sucks and that's the truth."
1,Dullsville on a Canon Printer,"I purchased this Hammermill glossy flyer paper for the convenience of Amazon, the Hammermill name, and other reviews. However, On my Canon inkjet printer, the color comes out quite dull and not true to what's on your screen. I had used Staples glossy brochure and flyer paper in the past with good results, so I decided to go ahead and purchase some more at Staples -- the difference is amazing. The Staples paper is true to color and bright. The exact same picture with the exact same settings on the Hammermill -- not true to color and not bright.Perhaps it is just not the right paper for a Canon injet (ip6600). All I know is, I won't be purchasing this brand again.As far as purchasing from Amazon, it came in 2 days with Amazon Prime, as always."
4,Nice tale,This is a nice tale that could be related to different situations. Sentimental. Given to my college daughter.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This album sounds good on the surface, but the songs really don't stand up to repeated listens. One of the annoying things about Parker is that he often has strong starts to a song, Tracks 1, 2, and 6 for example, and then gets to a chorus or bridge that is out of place or otherwise weakens the song. Especially track 6, which is a fine song until he starts an out-of-place ""la-la-la"" and then comes to a guiter solo that sounds like it belongs on a Hall and Oats album from the 80's. I cannot recall a song that goes from good to awful in such an extreme way. In summary, if this album is playing in the background, it sounds great. If it has your full attention, the songs simply do not impress, and ultimately disappoint."
4,Doo-Wop,"This CD is DooWop at it's best. Great clarity, original groups. One of the best CD's I've purchased for this era - What memories!"
5,A dream come true,"It was a great experience, this product is everything i ever dream of.Is the most beatifull watch i have ever own. It brought me a lot of satisfaction. So far, is been 100% accurate, just like i expecteded, and i am getting lots of complements from my friends, and also from perfect estrangers."
3,Not as Shown,"Unfortunately the watch we received was not the same as pictured. Rather than the black hands on a gold face, the watch had gold hands on a gold face which were difficult to see unless the light was just right. Fortunately, the service was excellent. We were able to return the watch with no problems at all and received a full refund promptly."
5,OUTSTANDING,manchild's ridiculous rapping ability + dust's grimy soul beats = incredible...again. can't wait till ablum #4!
1,Live Not Good.,The sound of this live disc does not sound good . The music and the songs are not the some.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Good heavens, this type of art may have been considered ""risque"" or bold or even vulgar at the time of its creation, but I was just bored. The male figure, in various poses, without clothing. *yawns*"
4,Timex Ironman Data Link USB Watch,"The Timex Ironman Data Link USB Watch has been around for several years and I think somehow it has remained a secret. It really is a miniature PDF. I download my somewhat complicated work schedule from Windows Outlook directly into the watch, where I can check it at anytime. It has a 15 minute alarm reminder. Birthdays have one week countdowns. All contact phone numbers and e-mail addresses can be downloaded from Outlook. There are many other useful functions (even keeps good time)."
1,Techno Junk,"Case is easily scratched, If you use the Indiglo feature much the battery life is very short, 3 months from my experience. Worst of all, this really is a one battery watch. Since changing the battery, the watch will reset when the stem is pushed down and at some other times. I've been testing it now (pretty much out of commission for a few months while I used another watch that would not reset by itself) and I've still got lots of problems. I could live without the indiglo feature, but the surprise resets make this a ""keep near the computer"" in case it needs to be re-sync'ed with the correct time. And my computer does a much better job of alarms, appts. and timekeeping, just in a much larger box."
3,For Mac users - This watch is not a right choice,Good watch. i love it. the software is not compatable for Mac. I will work only in windows.
2,I used to love this watch,"I've been using these watches (and their sibling, the 53722) for years, the multiple timers are really useful for me. But for the past few years the battery life just keeps getting worse and worse. The last 2 both died after 3 months. You can't replace the battery, because then the beeper dies.It was a great product in its prime, now I am looking for a replacement. Neither Timex nor Casio seem to have a good replacement with multiple timers."
5,Highly customizable watch,"The possibility of add and remove applications to the watch is very interesting. And if you are a developer, you can create your own application to it."
1,Did Not Work At All,"In short, I downloaded the Desktop software, Connected the USB cable, The watch said ""COMM READY"" but was unable to connect with my pc. ""DEVICE UNDETECTED"" was all I got.Returned the Timex and bought a Casio DataBank which is much more reliable."
1,Disappointment,"I currently own an older model of the data link watch, a product that I am 200% satisfied with. Based on this satisfaction and that it is an invaluable tool for me, I thought that the newer model would be even better. Sorry to report that it was a total failure. Either I received a lemon or the product didn't live up to my expectations. Amazon was wonderful in arranging my refund and return."
5,Data Link Watch,Easy to use and even read without needing to pickup my reading glasses.Night backlight could be a little brighter for twilight hours.A great tool for reminders and keeping up on schedule. Overalla wonderful companion for people that work environments thattend to severely shorten life expectancies of a PDA's. Between this and the notebook computer it seems to cover all the bases.I give it a thumbs up.
1,Defective Watch,"Within 3 weeks of purchase the watch malfunctioned. Pressing the ""crown"" button which usually illuminates the watch now resets it. I don't wear my watch tight and the watch started reseting itself a few times a day. Amazon has beeb horrible in fixing the problem. As of November they have yet to refund me for the purchase."
4,Timex Watch # T5C291 - Data Link USB,"Nice looking watch, contains tons of addresses/phone/notepad space. However, you cannot adjust the wrist band easy, I had to take the watch to a jeweler an have him do it. Although the USB connection seems to work really well, I still miss the ease of loading the watch via the Computer monitor like on the old Data-Link 150 model."
4,Sorry if you missed out...,"I think this line has been discontinued by Timex, which is unfortunate...it is a great watch packed with features, but in all honesty, probably features you'd find on a good cell phone.I'll be very disappointed one day when mine gives out and I've got to find another kind of watch to replace it."
3,Cool Watch,"I bought this watch for my husband. He loves it. I would have given it a higher rating if the buttons weren't in such an inconvenient place. My husband is right handed & wears the watch on his left wrist. The mode select button is inadvertently pressed when he moves his hand, and it bumps the buttons... When he checks the time, the watch is rarely in clock mode."
5,Timex Data Link USB Watch #T5C291,"Absolutely great. It's perfect to have all of your essential information on your wrist. Alams, appointments, schedule, etc, etc, etc."
4,Timex Data Link USB Watch #T5C291,"The watch is quite convenient, as it holds phone numbers, apppointments, and additional optional components that can be installed. It interfaces with your computer and can take information from Outlook. I only wished that it could hold more than just one elective application. It has multiple alarms for daily use or appointments. The display is large and clear, and the watch looks good."
2,Needs refinement,"I've owned 2 of these watches. They're great when they work. I travel frequently and it's great for that. After about a year of use, the alarm feature stopped working on my first one. I need the alarm. I bought another. Another year goes by and now my second watch is malfunctioning. The light has a mind of its own. Blinks on and off on its own. Turns on then won't turn off. Battery life is not the best either. I would pay a hundred dollars for this watch if Timex would improve the design and make it a more reliable and rugged watch. The software needs updating too. They should make a Mac version."
2,Not So Good,I bought this with the idea of no longer carrying a smart phone. Well i was only able to sync it once. After that i got an error message about the watch and an invalid response. So i called customer service. Told me to change the battery. So I changed the battery and was able to sync it a total of 3 more times. Then i got the invaid response. Called customer service again. Told me to ship it to them. 3 weeks has passed and i have not heard anyting. Bought a new smart phone in the meantime. Not a good idea.
2,"good concept, bad USB connection, and cheap band","I had one for almost 3 years. I like the idea of carrying a little PDA as a wrist watch. But the first watch I got would not connect to my PC, so I exchanged for a new one. The second one worked and I could enter limited phone #, calendar, etc. However, USB connection stopped working 2 year ago, even after I put in a new battery. I can't use it as a PDA any more, only as a stop watch with more convenient alarm options (daily, weekly, Saturday, Sunday, etc.). A few weeks ago, the watch band began to break at the rubber links. I have to buy a new watch band that does not match the watch very well (I can't find a matching replacement band). I wish Timex makes more durable watch bands and more robust USB connection for this versatile watch."
3,winding stem breaks,"I love the functionality of this watch, but hate the fragile fake ""winding stem"". It is a serious design flaw. I have broken 2 of these babies, and am on my 3rd one. Now I only wear it to record lap times when jogging on a track, and I'm very careful with the winding stem."
5,More mobile than a PDA,"This is the 3rd Ironman Datalink watch for my husband. They have been more scarce recently so he requested a backup for his current watch #2. The 1st watch connected with the computer via the monitor. When monitor technology advanced to digital displays he had to move to this model which links via USB. The watch has never failed and gets a pretty tough workout in a very corrosive environment. It links easily to a PC to synch with schedules and phone book. Looks professional yet rugged. Lots of timer capability for his work as a chemist.He doesn't want to be without one in the future.The only real drawback is the dedicated watchband which, after several years, has broken. He really likes the metal link style band, but hasn't yet found a replacement.Help me out. Go ahead and buy one! If enough others become hooked on this versatile watch, maybe Timex will still be making them for another 10 years."
5,Timex Purchase,The watch was as described. This was a replacement for one that I broke and it was delivered quickly and was exactly what I expected. I would buy from this vendor again.
5,I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS WATCH FOR YEARS,My Timex Data Link is a dressier version than the one I have been wearing for years with the plastic/rubber band. This is a little heavier mostly due to the metal/rubber band and you may have to take some links out. I used a push (tack) pin to move the link pins out which worked easy enough for me though some folks I know just went to a jewler. This is a dressier style and hopefully the four (face ring) screws will not come loose on this watch. My other (non dressy) Data Link with the plastic/rubber band was worn all the time and I had it for several years. It had come to reset itself the past few months and loose all data (even with new battery) but the decent price had me try this dressier one which I am happy with. I will try to take this one off before working on cars and projects.
1,The Watch is Great but THE WATCHBAND IS HORRIBLE,"I've had Timex Data Link watches since they first came out, and the Ironman version is terrible. The watch itself is fine, but the ""metal"" band has small rubber connectors between the links. These connectors break when stressed, and fall apart even more easily as the watch band gets older. Unfortunately, the watchband connects to the watch with an unusual design, and can't be replaced with a more durable band. (Note in the picture the two black rubber projections, almost like prongs connecting to the watch itself.) If you buy this, plan on replacing the watchband every 1-2 years."
4,Best watch I've found for Medicine Reminders,"I'm taking 37 pills, spread out over 14 different dosing times a day right now. I needed something to help me keep all those pills and times straight. Because a watch would always be with me, it made more sense for me than trying to use a PDA or any kind of reminder that I could put down somewhere and lose, or forget.This Timex Ironman watch has been just about perfect for my needs. The software is super easy to use and understand, and the watch does just what Timex says it will do.I wish it were not so large, but I understand why it is, and accept that as its only real drawback for me. There are a few minor tweaks that I would love to be able to make to the software, but nothing that I can't do without. My biggest wish would be that I could make the alarm louder."
4,A great watch,"I just purchased this watch after using Casio data bank watches for the past 10 years or more. I rejected the new Casio watch because of the negative reviews. There are only two things that I wish this Timex watch had: 1. A louder alarm for people like me that have a hearing loss in the high frecuency sounds. 2. I miss the calculator that the casio watch had. In one of the reviews for this watch, a calculator is mentioned. I would like to know how he got the calculator on his watch.Other than the two items listed above, I am very happy with this watch. Don"
4,Timex Ironman Datalink T5C291 Review,"I bought this watch after deciding that I did not want to carry around a bulky, older model Blackberry for work. It works great! It looks good enough to wear every day or to a meeting with its silver and black design. The only complaint that I have about the watch is that my company's IT department will not let me install the software onto my work machine (one day they will figure out that they do not run the company, and that their job is to make things easier), so sometimes I go through double entry. This means that I have to enter calender information on my Outlook calendar or planner at work, then come home and enter the info on the Timex software and download it to my watch. Overall, this is a good product, especially if you have the option to install the software on a company pc."
4,Impressive,"I'm going to compare this watch to my old Data Link 150, which this watch replaced.Benefits: Cheap, display very easy to read-much more so than the 150, easy to adjust bracelet...took 5 minutes, don't pay $15 to a jeweler for this unless you are a klutz, locking bracelet, USB transfer works great, crown scroll wheel much better than the button-pressing 150 mode, free software is very adequate, password system is very useful and a real necessity to use this thing in the way it was intended.Reservations: It's ugly. I don't trust the part-plastic bracelet. I would much prefer (and would GLADLY pay more for, Timex, hint) an upgraded, dressier, all-stainless, silver-and-gold toned case and full stainless bracelet like my 150 came with. It would be 5 stars with these things fixed.UPDATE 5-11-2012 Still ugly as sin, but holding up great!"
4,classic scary movie fan,"This movie is one of my favorite ghost stories. The story centers around a novelist who loses his wife and moves away trying to forget his grief. He buys a house and settles in. Unknowingly he has followed his destiny. He discovers the body of a woman in his basement along with her diary and so begins his journey. This story has a wonderful plot and is well done, despite its low budget exterior. If your not looking for a lot of gore and blood, and you just want a wonderful ghost story, with a smart plot, this is your movie!"
5,Never Forget The Forgotten One,This movie is just pure awesome Terry O'Quinn and Kristy McNichol is just awesome as well. I like movies that have suspense and drama as well as mystery behind it.
5,Kick-a** Rock-n-Roll from Siberia!,"I first heard the Red Elvises in the film ""Six-String Samurai,"" and became instantly addicted. This album is the only one of theirs I own (so far), and as such has an almost permanent place in my stereo.The Red Elvises blend the best elements of Surf rock, 50s Rock-n-roll, and Russian folk music to create a wonderfully twisted and toe-tapping sound! Their rendition of ""Rock n' Roll Music"" (by Chuck Berry) must be heard to be believed! Ditto their rearrangement of Brahms' ""Hungarian Dance #5"" -- a wonderful rock piece, now that they've gotten their hands on it. Zhenya Kolykhanov is a brilliant guitarist, Igor Yuzov has an amazing talent for writing wonderfully tongue-in-cheek lyrics, Avi Sills is a great rock drummer, and Oleg Bernov's base (the CD liner calls it a Base Guitar, but it looks like a giant balalika to me!) is the glue that holds it all together. Awesome!!!"
3,Good Book,This is a good book for some background information on the history of the trail and understanding the flora and fauna along the trail
1,Waste of money,These clippers don't leave a clean cut. They will smash and splinter your cat's claws. I did a better job with my old toenail clippers.
3,A good watch until it breaks,"I am currently on my third watch of this exact brand. My use has mostly been for swimming but also some daily use. The first watch lasted 4 years until the strap started breaking up. During this time I only had to replace the battery once and it ran perfectly. Thus when I needed a replacement I ordered a new one. This one started leaking after one week and then broke down. I have just started using my third watch and so far it runs ok (one week).I keep on buying this watch because it is the best one I have been able to find for my purpose. It is light and sleek and does not give too much water resistance when swimming. Also, it is inexpensive so I am willing to take the chance of getting a non-working one. Thus if you get this watch you must realize that it is a gamble if it will work at all when used for swimming. If it works, then the strap will eventually disintegrate (and cannot be replaced). How long time this takes depends on how much you use it."
3,Great when it works,"Mine worked great for about a year. I liked the layout and the 50 lap memory.A few months ago, the main start button started to get harder and harder to activate. Then I took it to Hawaii and water managed to get inside the watch. It went down hill from there pretty quickly.So much for ""takes a licking and keeps on ticking"""
2,Band separates from watch...,"I have been a loyal buyer of the Timex Ironman watches for years. This version is probably the 6th I have owned, and I would have to say the worst. The main problem I have had with the plastic band version of these watches is the band starts separating from the watch body near the buttons.For my previous Ironman, the separation started after 2 or 3 years. This current Ironman started separating in less than a year. I'm not sure what the problem is, but maybe the way I hold the watch when pushing the buttons puts stress on the connections. Who knows. I do know that I am looking for a new watch and would not buy this style of Ironman again."
1,Picked a lemon,"I've purchased this same exact watch before and it worked great. Used it for swimming, running, and everything in between. Not a problem with the first watch. I decided to purchase the same exact watch again through amazon.com since my first watch was getting pretty beat up. I'd had it for years and the wrist band was about to go. The silver grey paint was starting to flake off. The new second watch looked exactly as my first watch except the 2nd day I used it for my usuall swimming sessions I noticed the watch a few hours later had fogged and water had gottten into the watch were it shorted out the crystal display. Bad luck of the draw!?!?!? I'll probably buy another of the same model and figure that this one just happened to be a lemon."
2,Love Ironman watches but can't replace band on these models,"Love the performance of the Timex Ironman BUT beware the band on this model can not be replaced. My band broke in less than a year. Hummm, could this be a way to sell more watches or just poor design (defective)? For about the same money, buy a Timex model T5E2419J or similar...bands are replaceable."
1,Broke after one drop,"So much for ""Takes a Licking"". This watch broke the first time I dropped it. I wouldn't recommend this one. Buy the classic Ironman Timex watch with two buttons. I've had the older model for years and although it is missing two buttons, I haven't had a problem. As per this one. Don't waste your money would be my recommendation."
2,Can't find replacement watch band,Like the watch but band broke after a short time and there is no replacement that I can find. Very frustrating. Sleek must mean no replacement.
2,$10 to replace the band.,"Like so many others, I wish I would have read these reviews prior to purchasing this watch. For the first 12 months I loved it, but shortly thereafter the band fell apart and now it looks like the customer image provided at the top of the page. I would not recommend this watch unless you are looking for a short term relationship with it or comfortable operating in from your pocket. Timex will replace the band for $10 if you ship it to them (including shipping). Hotline 1-800-448-4639. I got a postage paid box from my local running store."
3,Tri Sleek Thoughts,The watch is great. It is sleek and wears nice. It has big numbers and is easy to read during racing events. The only problem that I have had with it is that one side of the wrist band came off. I have tried to put it back on with no luck. So now my favorite watch sits in the drawer doing me no good out in the field. If you can help me get it fixed I would appreciate it. Thanks
4,Good function for the money.,"I needed a watch that could help me with doing interval training. For the price, this was the best choice for me. The band does seem like it could break easily, but even if it did, I could just stick it in my pocket and still hear the beeps so I'm not too worried about it."
3,not bad,"not too shabby, well priced for a okay product if you ask me. I only got this for my sunday run around the neighhorbood"
5,Great product for the cost,"Ordered this watch as a replacement for my old one that got stolen while deployed; it took only roughly 12 days to get it from the date I placed the order. Amazon, you did it again :) extremely easy to program, fits nicely, and has a lot of features such as multiple alarms. Everything I could need and more."
5,Great for runners,"I have had many similar watches over the years but this is my favourite. The timing functions are perfect and the size is just right. My problem is the same as everybody elses - the band. I have had watches with non-plastic watchbands but over time the sweat from your arms gets into them and they smell. The plastic watchband has no such problem. However, the plastic loops deteriorate over time as do the bands themselves and you cannot get a replacement band. Replacements should be available because they are easy to replace. I have 2 of the watches so I swapped the band from another to this."
4,Great watch,"Very reliable...still ticking after more than 5 years...original battery. Not a fan of the band as others have stated, but it is a very durable watch. Used it for running, snowboarding, even scuba diving 120ft deep and still looks and works perfectly."
5,Just what I needed,This watch has time to the second; day of the week; month; and day of the month displayed. It doesn't lose or gain more than 10 seconds per month. It has some stop watch and alarm features which I don't use. It is much less bulky than some others. judging by my past Timexes it will last at least three years The price is right. Why anybody would buy anything else for an everyday watch is beyond me. The instructions for setting etc have been greatly improved since my previous Timex.
5,Timex Still Keeps on Ticking,Great watch. The only thing is that replacing the band is next to impossible but the watch does last at least two years.
3,After 2 years went dead after going in ocean,I love this watch and there is no reason not to get it. I'm buying my second one. The previous one which I had for two years though got water on the inside after I took it into the ocean.
1,"Watch is great, but custom band doesn't hold up.","I really liked this watched when I first got it. It has the features I need, and I liked the look of the band. When I went running with the watch on, even I was sweating profusely, the band allowed my skin to breath unlike some other watches with plastic bands.But after 3 months or so, I started having problems with the band. One side came off, and it was a **** to get it back together. After that, it would keep coming off, until it was just unusable. Since it is a custom band design, I could not replace the band, which is bad, because the rest of the watch still looks brand new. I didn't want to bother sending it to timex for repair; I just bought another timex watch that doesn't have an integrated band like this."
2,My worst Timex Ironman watch,"The watch should have been better. It has all the right specs, but;the band fell apartthe start/lap button was very hard to press, leading to mis-counting of laps and times.I wish I returned it right away."
4,Excellent Choice!,"My husband already owns this watch. This was purchased for young adult son as a gift. For the price, it is perfect choice and simple to operate. The watch strap does wear over time and will snap due to type of plastic material it is made of....BUT, just return it to Timex and they will REPLACE the entire watch, not just the strap!"
5,My favorite watch ever,"I love this watch! I'm a swimmer and it's great for timing laps, it's perhaps the most comfortable watch I've ever owned and I've owned quite a few. Easy to read and operate and very smart looking."
2,Cheap Watch,"I bought this looking for a cheap watch to go running with. Like so many other people I ignored the bad reviews and focused on the good ones. Initially I was very impressed with the watch. It was light, comfortable and had all the features I was looking for. After using it for a couple of months I went to put it on and it was completely dead. I replaced the battery and everything was fine. I then used it almost daily for my summer ocean lifeguard job, and the band came off the watch and I haven't been able to get it back on. I purchased this watch on January 9, 2007 BTW."
4,Band replacement must ship to Timex & $10.00,"I had this watch for several months and still think its a great watch but you should know this:I needed to put the watch in my pants pocket for a brief time and the flexing removed the band.I have tried to have it replaced in a store but no store could do it with that band.I checked with Timex and received this response.- -I am sorry about the problem with your watch. Unfortunately, that watch does not have a user replaceable band. You would need to send it in to Timex to have the band replaced. The cost for the band replacement is $10.00 plus any applicable tax. The address to send the watch to isHotline Watch ServicePO Box 8009Little Rock, AR 72203Please include your return shipping information, a note stating that you need a band replacement and a check or money order for $10.00 made payable to Timex.Sincerely,Jean ShowmarTimex Group USA Inc. Customer Service.js"
3,"Great features, poor dependability","Unfortunately, I am now shopping for my next Ironman Triathlon watch. The features of this one are wonderful. Multiple timers, multiple alarms, lap memory...it is outstanding.However, I have gone through 2 of these watches now. The first one simply stopped working. Replacing the battery did not work (I tried more than one). On the second one, the light stopped working only months after I started wearing it. About 2 months after that, the band broke on it.Be sure to check out the other reviews of this watch (in other Amazon listings). They all say the same thing and had the same problems.Timex, I hope you're watching."
2,"Kinda worthless as an ""Ironman"" watch",Be forwarned that you can't use this lap swimming as it is not water resistant when you press the buttons. Mine went dead thanks to that and it makes an expensive paper weight. Worthless.
5,Best running watch I ever had,"It takes 5 min to read the user guide, just do it and you are golden. I like the grooved wristband it helps your skin breath, it doesn't accumulate dirt like other watches. Easy to see, easy to use, and cool looking too.Buy it!"
2,Not impressed,The indiglo light lasted less than a month and the way to review your splits is more complicated than on the Nike watches. It is lightweight however and does not bother me when I run.
2,"Great watch, spoiled by lousy button!","I bought my first one over a year ago. It worked fine at first, but it wasn't long before the start/split button became hard to press. Sometimes it would work fine. Usually though, it either wouldn't register a split, or it would register 2 in a row!I bought a second one a few months ago thinking that my first one just wore out. Within in couple weeks, the second one was just as hard to use.I don't even use the watch in races anymore because I found it too distracting trying to make sure it register my mile split. I'm going to send it to Timex for warranty work. In the mean time, I'll have to buy another watch or go without."
1,Great watch if you don't plan to wear it on your wrist,I love the large display and functionality of the buttons. Too bad the band keeps peeling off.
2,"Nice watch, but poor rubber watch bands.","I like the watch unit. It has large numbers, with 2 interval timers, which are great for interval training.The bad part is the watch band. It cracks and breaks, and there is no way to replace it besides buying a new watch. Now I am looking for a watch with the identical features but with replaceable watch bands."
5,The ultimate test,"I never had a problem with mine,I'm a marine and the fact that I went trough combat with mine and held up made it worth the few bucks I paid for it.I go trough watches like they are made of paper,had this one for 2.5 yrs and other than a lot of scratches it works fine."
4,Great watch until the band broke,"As the title states, the watch band broke after about a year. It broke in the middle of the band at a point that does not seem to have much stress placed upon it.Since I am looking for a different watch, I did not explore repair avenues.Other than that, the watch performed perfectly."
1,Watch band broke and can't be replaced,I owned this watch for about a year and the watch band broke. I have been unable to find a replacement or figure any way to replace it if I did.
4,One step overboard for the price range?,"I've used a Timex Expedition (B0000D1662) for years, but this is less expensive, more stylish, and more functional - it's as though the prices are backwards.The IronMan30 has a night-light system that far surpasses the Expedition, with brightly glowing number elements rather than a weakly back-lit face, a more elabore lap/split chronograph, a simpler and more accurate timer, separate day/weekend/weekday alarms, and a recessed face.That last feature is very important: I've had to replace my Expedition every few years because the face always got scratched, soon after purchase. But the IronMan30 has a recessed face that hasn't been scratched yet!The IronMan50, by contrast, has what the 30 has plus 20 more laps. If you have more than 30 (even more than 10?) laps to time, you should probably invest in a more expensive watch - one with a heart monitor if not also a compass and/or altimeter, depending where you're doing those laps."
1,Don't bother...,"I've owned 3. All 3 had the same problem, the band is defective on these watches. It will break, you can't fix it, Timex will insist you buy another whole watch and not repair the band...I played the return game twice and wore the 3rd watch until it too broke.Lightweight, comfortable, functunal, but defective band design.That's why they are on sale everywhere."
1,"Watchband goes, throw the watch away","Very sad - excellent watch but the band is integrated into the design. It wraps up along the side and help create some of the waterproofing quality. I called Timex about this and they do not make replacement bands. The only way to get it serviced is to send the watch in for warranty repair, which gets you a new watch.Timex did graciously replace one under warranty, but now my second has had EXACTLY the same problem and I don't have the patience to send the thing in for a few weeks every time this happens. Really truly unfortunate because it is a nice watch."
2,"Nice watch, lousy watchband","It's a nice enough watch, but the watchband separated from the watch body in less than six months. This isn't one you can replace it, it's molded into the body. I emailed timex, and I got a ""We don't make watchbands, contact ..."" when I asked if it was possible to replace the watchband. In other words, an even more disposable version than they normally make. I've worn Timex watches since I was a kid. I think this may be my last one."
2,Beware: The band will break in 13 months,"Great watch for running -- I loved the huge display, the large buttons that were mostly easy to push (the side ones are trouble sometimes but the lap button is always easy), everything. Great. Then, just past my 1-year warranty deadline, the strap broke in two places on the same day. The watch is now useless b/c, as others have noted, you can't replace the band. It's a real shame b/c until now I've never had a single problem w/the watch. I wore it every day for a year, including running many many miles w/it through all kinds of weather. So it's a great watch, but the unreplaceable band pretty much kills it."
2,"awful band, good watch","i've had three of these watches, but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on. its ridiculus b/c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore Triathlons. however the interval counter is a great feature. but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two?"
3,Loved this watch....for about a year,"The bad: This was a perfect watch until the band broke. It first broke through one segment at about a year but managed to hang together going through another segment and then finally snapping in half at about a year and half. The price while at first seemed great for the features is high considering it. Is a throw away when the band goesThe good: loved the band (before it broke) super comfortable and because of the open design didn't get all sweaty underneath. The interval timer was awesome for doing interval sprint training. Three alarms, with separate settings for weekends and weekdays. Night function to keep light on longer. Easy to use buttons.Overall if you don't mind purchasing this watch every year then definitely buy it. If however spending this much on a watch every year seems unappealing then don't buy it."
5,Awesome & Hardly noticeable,"This is the perfect watch for basic time monitoring for exercise. With running, I like to feel as light possible and this watch def accomplishes that. At the gym I use it frequently to monitor rest periods between sets with the Split timer. Also, when using kettlebells I simply rotate the watch face to my inner-wrist and it's still comfortable but saves the weights from hitting the buttons on the watch."
5,"Light, clean and cheap!","This is my 3rd watch of this model, over the last 6 years. The first I used for 3years but I smashed it against a rock.... The second one I'm still using it ..... And the 3rd is for my son.... This watch is super light-wheight, fits well over my wrist and is cheaper than those with heart-belt... The chronograf is exactly what I need for timming-running...So I recomend it for the ones that don't need super-functions watches...."
4,gift,"I really have not had the chance to see how this performs. It was bought as a gift, and at this writing, has not yet been given. However, it is specifically what the person ""ordered"" on his gift list, so am anticipating it will meet the standards hoped for."
2,Thirsty to drink in water,"This watch, like its Timex predecessor, succumbed to water infiltration. I was not snorkeling or scuba diving. The first watch I wore into a shower so it wasn't fully immersed. The other was worn into a lake for a quick swim while camping. Neither lasted a year.The band provides great ventilation and a cool look on the wrist. This watch is unfortunately as reliable as the ones they don't keep locked up in a case. I would not buy another Timex."
4,T54281,"I needed an inexpensive watch to perform interval timing with an alarm for the ""peak eight"", Peak 8 exercise regimen.I had purchased this same model twice from a local sporting goods store for 40% more money. The first one was lost the second was stored, improperly by me, with the glow light depressed which killed the battery.The low cost of this unit makes it not practical to change the battery. It is a bear to change and my watch did not work afterwards. - May not have been the watch's fault. The Glow light may have over heated the rest of the circuit.Only complaint: the Alarm is not loud enough or it is generated at too high of a frequency for me to hear. I have to look at the watch to see the interval time out. In a noisy gym or a windy outdoor situation I just can't hear the alarm."
4,Good Value,This is the third Ironman my husband has owned and we reordered because the last two held up for over two years.He works outside in bad weather and his watches take a beating. These have proved far more durable than much moreexpensive watches.
4,Good Practical Watch,"Good watch for the price. Easy to read time and relatively easy to operate. I had another one, and it lasted about 3 1/2 years."
3,Kinda large for petite women.,"Originally purchased as a gift for my wife.My wife is a petite woman and when she received item she was extremely happy to receive it, but as soon as she wore it, she disliked it just a little because the face and band of the watch are a little to large for her hand. Although this watch is described as a unisex watch, i believe it is intended more for a men's wrist.Overall it is a good watch, nice round face and big led numbers make this a great buy."
3,Strap Fell Off,"I have used this watch for 2 1/2 years and loved it. My only initial complaints when I first received it was that it would not store a record of my runs and the beep sound was much too soft to hear. Other than that it is very light and sleek and a good watch. Yesterday, however, the band just fell off the body of the watch while I was driving. I am unable to reattach it. I like this watch enough that I am considering buying another, but other comments about the band falling off have me concerned."
1,"Poor design, short life","I purchased this watch just prior to a deployment to Afghanistan (I am a US Army officer). Upon returning, the watch battery died--for a total run time of less than six months! I discovered that the battery was drained by buttons sticking. Shortly after replacing the battery, buttons began sticking again. WHAT A HORRIBLE DESIGN! I am going back to the ""traditional"" IronMan that's worked for the past five years. After making this decision, I disected the watch to try and fix the button stick problem. NO luck. Timex, PLEASE go back to the drawing board on this one. What a waste of $69."
2,No second disk,"Not going to waste time rereviewing the movie since others have done a much better job of it then I have. What I will say is that Fox has given us a bum deal with a single disk version lacking all of the good bonus features found on the Indian version. No directions comments, no bonus scenes; just a couple of duds. If you are interested in getting this film you should track down a 2-disk Indian version."
5,Loved it!,"This is one of those rare movies that directors feel they have to make and actors have to be a part of. It didn't get a lot of hype in this country and to be fair, not so fond of the subtitles. But if you were a fan of 'Forrest Gump', 'Schindler's List', or even 'The Pianist', this is the movie for you. It is actually a triumph of the human spirit, and how simple life can be broken down. Good people do good deeds and bad people do bad deeds. This movie transcends religious boundaries and lets us all know how much our prejudice hurts other people. I don't know much about the actors or the production company. I just know that there were times I felt ashamed, times I felt sad, and times I just wanted to cheer. Sit down with your kids, watch this movie, teach them something about how the world has changed. Teach them how to make this world better..."
5,Excellent film. We all cried.,I cannot wait to buy this film so that I can share it with friends and families. It was one of the better movies I've seen in a long time. Thank you Bollywood for efforts made to produce such a meaningful film.
2,"Cheesy, over-the-top melodrama bordering at ridiculous","As another reviewer pointed out, this movie tries to be too many things at once: terrorism and the prejudice against Muslims, understanding for people with autism, social justice, love, finding yourself and your place in the world despite shortcomings etc. You wonder if this movie is social commentary or romance or about self discovery. It is just too much. The acting by Shahrukh Khan is also too much. You can see he is acting and no good actor should look like they are acting. They need to look like they are truly the character they are portraying. Some of the scenes were painful to watch and bordered at sheer embarrassing. And i am ok with that actually: Bollywood movies are supposed to be embarrassing and over-the-top by tapping into the stereotypes of movie making from like 40 years ago. But when the movie attempts to be serious but turns out a grotesque farce, then suddenly the joke is on the makers."
2,WASTE OF TIME,"If you care about your time dont waste it on this movie it is just a poring stupid movie i suggest having sex will be more exiting and better than this !!let me ask you something did you ever saw a mother that her lovely 13 age child is killed in front of her eye and she is not crying and screaming ?? that is just a scene !!the movie is INDIAN movie so you have to consider that if you love Indian movies you will love it but if you arent ""like me "" keep my advice in your mind .anyway thanks to Sharoukhan and all people who work on the movie but really if they want to attract more people to bollyood they have to work H A R D !!!"
1,my nameis khan,"The movie starts out OK but deteriorates after the first hour into a really bad piece of tear-jerking, feel-good leftist pro-Muslim anti-American pro-Obama anti-Bush Bollywood propaganda that successfully rivals 1930-s Soviet state propaganda films."
5,great modern Bollywood,"Two of the top Bollywood actors in a movie that has everything: comedy, tragedy, music, and a message. Best part of these new Bollywood movies is that the production is sophisticated but you can still watch it with your kids and parents. Very sweet movie!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES MADE,"Although I do not like to write reviews, I will for this one. I cannot speak more highly of this movie and the lead actor Shahrukh Khan. I saw his interview on CNN's GPS (Fareed Zakaria-host, and was quite impressed. I then rented this movie and eventually bought it to share with others. I am a white American, and Catholic, and I loved this meaningful movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. After I saw this I became interested in what else this actor has done. I did also purchase Devadas which is a Bollywood Indian film ---beautiful film---a Cannes Film Festival nominee for Best Foreign film category in 2002 or 2003."
5,PHENOMENAL MOVIE!!!,I just finished watching this and I am just so emotional! It is a beautiful and moving story! I will be purchasing it as soon as I can! WOW!!!
5,Excellent!,"This is a really well-made movie. Touching and inspiring, you gonna love it!My Name Is Khan is definitely a must-see film!"
5,Surprisingly Wonderful!,"I never heard of this movie before ordering it from Netfix. It was listed in my Netflix ""Movies You Would Like"" category, so I put it in my Queue. My husband and I watched 'Khan' last night, and were very moved by this thought-provoking story. It caused us to laugh and cry and ponder the human condition. It is not a short film, but held our attention throughout. All the actors give superb performances. There's not a 'dud' in the bunch! I seldom buy DVDs or videos, but every now and then come across one that I want to have as my own to watch over & over again. ""My Name Is Khan"" is one of them."
5,A TOUCHING HEARTWARMING MOVIE,"My daughter and I love this movie. Although some parts were a little unrealistic, overall it was a great movie. Definitely a must see movie for the family and it will emphasize tolerance and forgiveness."
2,"short CD, lackluster mix","Not for anyone wanting the best of Roy BuchananSound effects are repetitive and not very well mixed.Lots of songs are so repetitive I was sure I bought the wrong CDShort , 35 minutesDissapointed."
4,Title,"The Download worked fine, but i think that it is missing some songs from the original album? I still Love this recording and an originan cd cost hundreds of dollars so I'm happy"
1,not as strong as I would have liked,I checked to see if it could hold my video camera that weighed 1.2 lbs. I thought it said it would hold it. Technically it does hold it up but it slowly goes sideways and cannnot hold up the weight. I will keep it and use it for my very small cameras
4,"Lightweight, but convenient.","First of all, realize that this is a special purpose tripod. It's great for panorama, HDR and low light applications - assuming a fairly light camera. It comes in a nice case and is vey easy to carry around, especially when you're walking through some fairly challenging country. Plus it's quite inexpensive.For studio work or work with heavy cameras and long lenses - forget it. It's much too lightweight. But the tripods and tripod heads I use for that kind of work are not something I like to drag around for casual outdoor shots."
1,Foot fell off in 3 days,Do not buy this garbage or any targus tripod for that matter! They always fall apart in at most a week! I had three different ones and they always fall apart.
3,A bit brief,"I like the information included in this book, but for a such a big, historic state it seems that 300 pages is not enough. The section on New York City is pretty good and the suggestions thoughout the state turned out well. I wanted more information about upstate. The history section doesn't mention the war of 1812 that played an important part in the state."
4,"Works Extremely Well, But Not Perfect","I purchased this product after I got blood on my bedsheets after a small cut went unnoticed. I wanted to save the bedsheet set, o bought this product. My bedsheets are white and blue.I followed the instructions on the package and placed the sheets in the washer. The blood stain was about the size of a quarter before it went into the washer machine, after washing with this product the size and appearance of the stain had been significantly reduced. However, the stain did not disappear completely with that or subsequent washes. Despite this, I was very happy with the results.Verdict: this product is probably the best of it's kind on the market. However, if you're looking for something that will erase all traces of blood (or the other stains this product cleans), you may be slightly disappointed but nonetheless satisfied. I definitely recommend this product."
1,The Kindle editions is NOT the screenplays,"Ordered this for Kindle -- was delivered the Tolkin novel ""The Player."" If you check the ""look Inside"" feature, it's the same thing. Hopefully Amazon will fix this -- but for now DO NOT ORDER FOR KINDLE if you want the screenplays."
1,lodge cast iron scrubber brush,"This product had no description as to the country of origin. As a consumer I assumed that it was an american product because it was being sold by Lodge cast iron products. The cost of postage to return it would be not to my advantage. A items should be identified as not being made by american labor!!! This makes me very leery about any future dealings with shady manufacturers. The cost of production savings is not passed on to the consumers that keep these companies in business, but the profits they gain are."
4,"Works well, but would be nice to have a replaceable brush head","This is my second purchase of this brush. The first was used regularly for 2-3 years and simply wore out. It works well for cleaning the cast iron cookware and function is great. However, it would be nice to able to replace the brush head instead of buying a whole new brush - otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
2,Why do you even need this?,"Go to your grocery store and buy a cheap plastic brush with nylon bristles. There. You just saved yourself some dollars.As other commenters have stated, you're basically paying for a generic nylon brush with the name 'LODGE' stamped on it. Are the brand name and the wooden handle really that important to you? If so, buy this and knock yourself out.For those worried about damaging their new grill pan, don't get sucked into buying this. Buy any nylon bristle brush and you're in good shape. Make a paste out of coarse salt and warm water and use that as the cleaning agent and your cast iron grill pan will be as good as new. If you can't get the gunk out between the grill lines, buyLodge Manufacturing Grill Pan Scraper, 2-Packto held disloge it. Yes, these scrappers are about as much as the scrubber brush, but they're about 1,000x more useful, so I think it's worth it."
3,don't scrub to hard,"I used this Lodge cast iron scrubber on my cast iron skillet and was terribly disappointed when the the first time I used it the bristles bent and did not spring back. I put it into the dishwasher to see if that would help.... It did a little, at least now the bristles are not laying completely flat but still squished. Wont buy another one."
1,Falls apart,Pretty poor quality. This thing fell apart about the third time I used it. NOT worth it. Shame on Lodge for selling such a bad product.
5,I love it.,I love this scrubber. It works very well on my cast iron pans. It is strong and sturdy so I can really scrub.
5,Perfect,The bristles are just about the rights stiffness for cleaning cast iron. Works great. I throw mine in the dishwasher to clean it after - not sure what is recommended.
1,won't last,This scrubber is made of wood. I have had it for less then a month. And have only used it about half a dozen times and the wood on the bristle part is already spliting apart. I don't see this lasting more then another month before it splits completely apart. I would not suggest buying this item.
1,Poor quality,"I was scrubbing my cast iron pot with this and the head popped off and bonked me in the face. Gross. It can be wiggled/jimmied back into place, but I'm still waiting for an apology from the brush for throwing egg in my face."
1,Cheep,"I like having the scrubber to use on my cast iron, but it is not well made. I only just recently purchased this scrubber, and have only used it 3 times since recieving the scrubber, but the handle has come off leaving the 2 mettle wires that held the handle to the head sticking out. I know that you should not leave an item like this sitting in water so I have been careful to make sure when not using it that I was placed out of and away from water. So this, to me, means this item was just not very well made."
3,Just ok,I've only had it for a month or so and the brush bristles are bending. I wish it would be a little stronger.
1,Utter Junk!,I have a lot of Lodge cast iron cookware and love it. Unfortunately this brush doesn't live up to Lodge's reputation. I got two- one for the kitchen and one for the camper. After a dozen or so uses each one started to fall apart. Once the handle falls off the first time you might as well throw it away. The head still works for scrubbing but as others have posted you're better off with a $1 all-plastic scrub brush.
1,"Looks nice, but fell apart",As soon as we received it the metal ring located on the wooded handle was floating between the handle and the brush. Then on the first use some of the bristles fell out. We immediately returned the brush.
3,Cheaply made,"I used my scrubber and it came apart the first use. The metal band that holds the scrubbing brush to the handle just fell out. I put it back together, but it still comes out. I tried to spread the prongs out, but the brush fell out. I guess I'd say ""Buyer Beware"""
1,Trash after first use!,"The bristles on this are terrible. I ordered mine here and paid full price and should have returned it. This type bristle folds over immediately and discolors and falls out. I didn't even press very hard, didn't have a lot of stuck on food to scour off. Inferior product."
3,So-So,"I love my cast iron pan and was stoked to get this brush (I purchased it at a local sporting good store for $3.99). I use my cast iron pan almost every day, so this brush did get a lot of use. It worked very well for about a month till the head started to wiggle and eventually fell off. I really liked the natural, non-plasticy look of the brush (opposed to something clunky and bright) but will purchase something else next time that will last longer."
1,Even the bristles are bad,"Bad, bad, bad, horribly bad. The plastic bristles of this brush are so cheap they bend in very hot water and if you set it down on the bristles after immersion, they warp. Lodge, what excuse do you have for not taking this brush off the market?"
1,scrub brush,I do not see the purpose for this. I feel it does not get the pot clean. I wind up using a dish sponge to get all of the food off the pans. Unnecessary in my opinion.
3,Does the job,"Better than the crappy Lodge splatter screen I just got. Works well at scrubbing my cast iron clean. Doesn't appear to be ""bullet-proof"", but it's a good product."
1,Don't buy this brush.,I bought this because a friend got me a square grill cast iron pan here on amazon which is really difficult to clean. This brush didn't even tickle that pan..Instead I use a copper scrubbing pad ..It works better!!
2,Unused yet,Have not used this product yet because I have not been able to use the cast iron skillet to make the cake because the cake plate I ordered was not big enough!
2,Made in China,I bought Lodge mainly because it is a good quality product made in USA. This scrubber brush is made in China.
1,Waste of money,"I ordered this brush to maintain my cast iron cookware which I love. As soon as I opened the product I was disappointed by the obvious lack of quality, cheap plastic bristles and the hanging loop was practicallly falling out prior to any use. On the first use of the brush the bristles which are made of cheap plastic flattened out. I end up getting about 3 disappointing uses for my $9 and now the brush is trash. Don't waste your money.Lodge Cast Iron Scrubber Brush"
1,I had to throw it out,"While it is attractive, this product is inferior to a cheap plastic model. Basic problem: I could not effectively clean it; I washed in the dishwasher, soaked it in baking soda and detergent; it was stilly greasy and discolored. On top of that, it just didn't really work."
2,Head detached from Handle,"The head detached from the handle after a few weeks of normal use. It stays pressure-fit, but keeps coming off or loose."
1,JUNK,Sorry that negative stars are not available. I have the one and two burner grill/griddle pans and love both except the clean up is a bit difficult at times. If a paper towel will clean it so will this brush otherwise the job is too tough for this brush and the paper towel is cheaper.
2,It's okay.,"It's an okay scrubber. Not much different than any other that you'd buy from the grocery store. It is not heat resistant. Even after letting my cast iron griddle cool for quite a while, using the scrubber and some hot water caused the tips of the scrubber to melt. The bristles also started to fall out before it melted. Again, it's an okay brush, just make sure your pans are completely cooled before using."
2,why bother?,Just use a medium or firm bristle potato (palm) brush. Cleans Iron Pans (and woks) quickly because your energy is directly put onto the surface of the pan. Big plus... A potato brush cleans in seconds under the faucet-- no special care -- or you can put it in the dishwasher if its really dirty!Clipper Mill Potato Brush / Cleaner
3,Not so durable...,"The brush worked very well until the head fell off (in about a month). I tried superglue, but that only worked for another few weeks. I do like Lodge products though so I have ordered another one; hopefully this one lasts me a bit longer."
2,Junk,"The only piece of crap I've ever had from Lodge. Cheap, poorly designed waste of time. Fell apart after third using. Wood used absorbs water and splits. Bristles too soft and flimsy. Stick to the hardware store for this type of brush."
1,Plastic bristles melted- buy one with natural bristles!,"I received this brush as a gift, but found the bristles were small diameter plastic and they melted the first time I used the brush on a hot pan- guess that could be my error, but expected a little more durability from something that has to scrub a cast-iron pan.I love Lodge cast iron pans and cook on them frequently. I'm going back to a natural bristle brush for my cast iron cleaning needs."
2,Not stiff enough,Tihs brush is not stiff enough for cast iron. Didnt work for anything that sticks to cast iron. I prefer a metal brush.
1,Worst product I have ever purchased,"I bought one of these a few months ago and it broke almost immediately. The metal prongs that attach the head to the handle popped out of the handle the very first time I used it.I couldn't believe that something would be so poorly made, so, embarrassingly, I purchased another one. The second one broke BEFORE I EVEN GOT A CHANCE TO USE IT. Again, the head popped off the handle.Unbelievably bad."
1,poor quality,"The first time I used this brush, the brush part came out from the wood handle. NOT recommended!"
5,"A practical ,workable product..... with a twist.","I have used this product for over month and it hasn`t fallen apart yet.After use , dry about the wood that holds the brush head and the metal ring that clasps it to the handle.Wood swells when wet and if left wet the devise ceases to function as designed.(the brush will fall off) When not being used on cast iron pans,this product is a great help in hard to get places;as a back scratcher, for instance.For $5.00, this a real bargain."
1,MADE IN CHINA,This is worthless. Purchased because I use LODGE cast iron skillets for cooking everything. Just buy a brush at the local store.
1,Brush did not hold up,This brush did not hold up for the cost. The handle has come off and if it is made to hold up on cast Iron skillets it does not. Would never buy this again
2,Not useful for the stated purpose,This is advertised for use in cleaning your cast iron cookware. It will not do that. Any owner of cast iron cookware knows that you clean it while it's hot. I used this brush on a hot pan (about 200 degrees) and it melted immediately. I had to throw it away.
1,Terrible design,"This brush is not nearly durable enough to do its job: the head and the handle will come apart with just a little too much elbow grease. The plastic bristles do very little to the inevitable remnants that cook in cast iron leaves. Do not, like I did, use it on a hot pan (the best time to get things that have gotten stuck off): the bristles will melt and the plastic will get in the precious pores of the pan, ruining both. Soft metal bristles would surely have been a better idea. Don't waste the few dollars."
1,Broke the second time I used it,"When I see anything with the lodge name on it, I'm just expecting quality.This brush broke the second time I used it. The two metal rods that hold the head onto the shaft just separated. I guess I could glue it back together, but a brush that I bought at BBB worked much better and I'm actually regretting throwing that one away when this one arrived."
1,Lodge Cast Iron Scrubber Brush,Looks good but started to fall apart shortly after a few uses. Cheap ones from WalMart or Target are better.
3,Bristles fell out a week after receipt..but Lodge sent me a new one.,"Not a bad brush, but some of the plastic bristles fell out about a week after using it. On the plus side I called Lodge and they were nice about it and sent me out a new one."
2,Lacks Quality,"I bought three of these, two as gifts for my daughters and one for myself. NONE of them lasted very long - the bristles were cheap and easily bent out of shape and fell out after the first few weeks of use. My daughters and I, who LOVE our Lodge pots and pans, are very dissatisfied by the lack of quality in this brush! Even at the ""bargain price"" of $4.00 each, I feel like I wasted my $12!"
2,Basic Brush - Not worth of Lodge Brand,"I was somewhat disappointed in this brush. First of all, it's made in China, so clearly Lodge isn't too concerned about the quality to begin with as they are with their actual cookware. The metal hanger tab in the handle seems to barely be inserted into the handle, so I doubt this will remain in the handle for very long. Otherwise the scrubbing surface seems to work well. I've only had it a short time so I can't comment on how well this brush will last over time."
2,fragile,"Like many of the other reviewers, I liked the design, but it broke on me really quickly. The design is okay, but I don't think this is worth the money."
1,What a rip off!,This item is simply the most cheaply made wooden scrub brush. Nothing special. It's flimsy and ordinary. Maybe it'll last a couple of weeks. My initial reaction: You've got to be kidding! It's a wooden stick with bristles and the connections are barely intact. I'm afraid to look back at what I paid because it's only worth about a dollar from the dollar bins at Target!
1,Junk,"I cannot believe that lodge would put their name on this product, it is poorly made and only lasted a month."
4,Written in a easy-to-read form,"This book gives a good overview of forensic image processing, and the challenges that are involved with using this in court. It has many image examples that clarify the text in the book, and was easy to read. The only thing that I did not like was that there are no references to literature sources given in this book."
5,Awesome!,"This is my first toolbox, and I have to say, it is everything I was looking for. The two storage bins on top are the perfect size AND they latch tightly and open easily. I had a tool set with extra bits for a screwdriver and this was perfect for those. I don't have too many tools yet, but I was able to easily fit all of them with plenty of room to grow. Great piece of gear. Not broken or poorly made. If you're looking for an excellent, compact, sturdy box for your tools, this is the one."
2,Careless quality control,"I received the box in good time and the packaging was OK. However, the latch of the box had been damaged prior to it being packaged. I was able to make a satisfactory repair but was disappointed that it was not perfect when received. It would have cost me more for shipping to return it than the box was worth."
4,Tool box,"It's a great tool box, I wish they made an 18"" though. 20"" was going to be too big, I had to do some creative manuevering to get all the items in there I wanted. Overall I can't be too upset, it was a great deal."
4,Golf Bag,"I recently purchased this bag for my husband. Along with the Golf Stiff Arm, it was a great item to have when travelling with golf clubs. The bag is spacious and very easy to maneuver with the wheels."
2,Guess you'd have to be there,"A fussy story that went nowhere for too long for me to keep interested. The characters seemed fun at first, but later annoying and not very credible. I have a feeling that if you were alive in the ethnic Jewish community of NY city at the time the book takes place, you would get enough out of this to rate it higher, but it did not ring true to me."
5,fascinating and highly readable--a keeper,"Am going to visit Leuven after reading this book! A fascinating book woven together by a rivetting storyteller. I've reread it several times; it's hard to shelve it for good! Absolutely gripping reading.An Unquiet History manages to cover a great expanse of time without becoming vague and generic, and without becoming too dense for the lay reader. The bibliography is super, too, and a well for more reading on the topic.I absolutely love this book and highly recommend it."
4,The Everything Freemasons Book,"The ""Everything Freemasons"" book re-enforced all the knowledge I previously acquired in the study of Freemasonry. It was an easy read, and very enjoyable"
2,can the writer be more biased!,"In spite the first words in the book are the writer claiming he's not biased, but that's all what I could see in the book!instead of stating facts and history, or providing objective analysis. the writer insisted again and again to defend the free masons and show how good they are! he didn't give the reader a chance to form an opinion, instead he kept repeating words like ""charitable"" and ""misunderstood"" several times. I expected an objective analysis and collection of facts, but found more biased opinion than anything in the book."
5,Fantasy at it's best,"I got into the fantasy genre fairly late, and this was the first book that I read. The characters are finely drawn, and as the mystical and mistical world of Gryylth and it's inhabitants become solid, you really do want to find out what's going to happen to Alouzon, Dythragor, Marrget, Wykla, and the people of Corrin, who have been fighting each other all for a handful of mist. As Suzanne Helling evolves (unwillingly) into Alouzon Dragonmaster, and Alouzon learns how to trust herself again, the line begins to blur a little, when does the fantasy become a life lesson, and when did life become fantasy? This begins to become clearer as you finish the book. I would highly recommend this book, whether you are a late starter or have read other books in the genre."
4,"A Darker, Meaner Ellison","In this recent collection, Mr. Ellsion delves into the arbitrary and ambivalent nature of fate. With stories like ""Mephisto in Onyx"", and ""The Man who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore"", he paints a bleaker, meaner picture of human nature, and he manages to very nicely to both entertain, as well as provoke."
4,"A Darker, Older View","Mr. Ellison, in this collection of short fiction, discusses thoughts of mortality in these tales displaying the indifference and ambivalence of fate. ""The Man Who Rowed Christopher Columbus Ashore"", and ""Mephisto in Onyx"" highlight an more intense, darker vision. Ellison hasn't lost his touch."
4,Review of Reflect Vest,I used this vest in a Running Relay Race at night and it was very comfortable to run in and was reflective enough so traffic did not come too close to me (we had to run on the street with traffic). The colors were nice and it was easy to take on and off.
5,Working Moms Rejoice!,"Here's a book that really captures the truth about the life of a working mom. It is intelligent and witty. I found myself laughing at loud over and over again. I couldn't believe how funny and candid some of the parts were. The book makes you wince and laugh and laugh and laugh all the same time, recognizing the truth about being a supermom. Great to give to a working mom who needs a laugh over the summer!"
5,GREAT FOR DOG'S SKIN IRRITATION,"Oh sure...plenty of products claim to help you with a problem, but the Epi-Soothe Oatmeal Cream Rinse & Conditioner delivers!!! My Yorkshire Terrier had gone to a ""reputable"" groomer when she was 8 months old. Seems that they likely used the wrong blade...and her hind leg was almost shaved to the skin. The hair either wasn't growing, or she was biting at her leg due to the itching - and it kept pulling the hair out. Nothing worked. Almost immediately when we started using this conditioner, it was AMAZING! We love the conditioner. It smells great, and she has plenty of hair growing on the hind portion of her legs. Even without a skin irritation issue, definitely use this for your dog. It's GREAT!"
5,"Simpson, M. Plant Systematics","One of the best plant systematics texts on the market. Highly recommend for any college-level botanist or aspiriing botanist. Covers a large subject in a lot of depth, and does so in a very informative and easy-to-understand manner."
4,"Lots of information, but somewhat rushed","The book is very densely packed with information, which is in no way a bad thing, but I feel that many of the terms are not properly explained before going on the the next 20 terms in the same paragraph."
2,Overly complex --- very winded!,"ok, this book has the detail you might like if you plan on attending graduate school specializing Botany. Otherwise, its long winded sections with awkward wording will drive you up a tree to escape its insufferable language. The author could of simplified most sections or included bullet point summaries, but no. Its simply a bad example of somebody trying to show off their knowledge in a overly-complex way.Also, the reviews above are actually by the publisher reps, not real people who use this book for their college courses. If you have a choice between books, go another route and save yourself some grief."
2,Not the product I expected,"Firstly, this software is a resource hog and adds about 30 seconds to Media Center's start up. It also adds delays to Media Center's response time.Secondly, the bundled microphone has a range of no more than 50 cm and even in that range, is very poor.Also, the software's ability to handle a music library of more than 5000 tracks leaves a great deal to be desired.Finally, this software is not completely tied into the Media Center processes. For example, if you ask MCC to play a song, and use your remote to watch a recorded TV show, the music will continue to play over your TV. To stop the music, you need to either open Media Player and press stop, or play a different song from within Media Center using your remote.I have since uninstalled MCC but have not written it off. I will give it a go in the future following the purchase of a better quality microphone."
1,Not the true Damian,"Damian Draghici is probably the world's greatest panflutist, and the true heir to Georg Zamfir. Listen to his early recordings, where the true Gypsy feeling, emotion and artisty prove this. It is sad - no, it's tragic - that this is the turn his career has taken. He is an extraordinary artist who has clearly been given disastrous career advice. Someone must have suggested he create a ""Gypsy Riverdance"" and this syrupy, ordinary effort is the result. It doesn't even showcase his talent. What's next, ""Live From Red Rocks?"" Don't buy this - do your ears and soul a favor and buy ""Romanian Gypsy Pan Flute Virtuoso"". I also heard him on the klezmer cd, ""Garden of Yidn"", and I am still haunted by it. Oh, well... if this pop bull helps to popularize Gypsy music, that deserves the star. But this music? No way."
4,.,"A band which deserves more attention than they've gotten, and Now is the essential album to own when it comes to Crescent. Gloomy, grungy, dirty, and often powerful, with a singer who sounds something like a slowed-down, doped up David Yow. Crusty lo-fi hardcore dark emo, sort of. There are a few tracks which are a bit lackluster, but the winners are songs that really stay with you. Good music for an angry rainy day. Strong atmosphere, interesting lyrics (those that you can make out), and lots of grit. Recommended."
2,Too much psycho-babble,"I was disappointed in this memoir. I'm a big fan of Richard Chamberlain's acting. However, this book reads like one long psychotherapy session. I came away from the experience feeling that Mr. Chamberlain is not a very complicated person. The writing style and the book have too much of a surfacy, ""sing-songy"" quality for me."
2,"Coming out at age 67, how brave--NOT!","I cannot believe this book actually has gotten a few positive reviews. I gave this two stars instead of one, because it's not terrible writing. It's just that I doubt that anyone but the most die-hard RC fan would be interested in it, anyone else shouldn't bother.When an actor comes out of the closet in the middle of a thriving career, then I will be impressed, NOT when it's near the end (or in this case, mostly over).There is no insight about what it was like working while hiding that part of one's life. And if I were his life partner and got such a paltry mention, I'd leave him! The rest of it is random musings that wouldn't matter to most people.If you want an alternative recommendation, get the graphic novel anthalogy ""American Splendor."" Harvey Pekar worked as a file clerk all his life and managed to lead a more interesting one than famous mini-series star Richard. Go figure."
