3,Ida Simonsen^^,"This soundtrack is deffeatly not the best from Hans Zimmers. But His scors are good for the movie, just like it should be. It's dark and powerful, and you can relax when you listen to it. But he has donne better like ""The Da Vinci Code"" og ""The Prince of Egypt""."
2,Not an actual Cover,"It is a slip cover which goes over the mic, thankfully my previous one was just cracked so I could use this. But, it covered the power button, so it was not best case scenario."
5,mondo fun!,"Jump on your Vespa and click on the 'buy' button, daddy-o! This one's a must-have for the chronically chic!"
5,THIS GUY IS TIKI RIFFIC !,"I got a chance to meet the author, and he is awesome. The book is fantastic, and details every, good and bad, tiki location around the country. You gotta get this book."
4,Very good ideas...,"There are many very good and simple ideas in this book. I am in the process of converting my home using these ideas. I love the recipes for ""green"" house cleaning products. Overall, this book is very helpful. The only thing I did not like was the organization of the book. I spent a lot of time flipping back and forth throughout the book. The author would introduce an idea and then not explain the idea until several pages later."
5,Wonder Book!,"I absolutely love this book. It is an easy read with tons of useful information. This book has literally helped me turn my life around. Our home shows the results and I don't have to rely on my horrible memory to keep track of things now, cause it's all in our Family Notebook! Thank you, Cynthia Townley Ewer for sharing your hard-earned experience."
4,add a sort category-Recycling!,"I have very high hopes for this book, as I am in dire need of organization or space, I am never sure which. This book is very visually satisfying, and on first take it seems like a good system, all one has to do is follow the advice. There are also references to her web site, as well as Clutterer's Anonymous. I am lucky enough to have a group in my town which I plan on visiting this week...But on my first trip into the system I found 1 quandary. Why no ""Recycling"" category? This is so important, especially now. I am really just at the beginning of the book. I hope to report some success later. But looks good."
2,not for me,"I bought this book because I was looking for a way to learn how to be organized. I have never been a good house-keeper and have piles of papers, clothes, etc. I need remedial help. This book is not remedial; it shows organized people how to clean and declutter better. It was very intimidating and made me feel worse than I already do. I'm sure that this author has never been as disorganized or as messy as I am and consequently cannot understand the issues involved for many of us who have never been organized or had a regular house-cleaning schedule. Lucky for me that I found Sandra Felton's books for ""messies""; I now have hope that I can create a cleaner, more organized home."
4,Have to use more than one set to get job done!,"I've been using theses the past how many months and I really enjoy using them. Curved helps with keeping them the same everytime without changing anything. Only downfall is that you use more one set per eyebrow. I end up using about 4-5 sets (upper bottom) just to get the job done! If you add it where you need it and rub it for a bit, it grabs more hair it seems."
3,A decent start - still need tweezers.,"I like these because they get me started with the correct shape. As long as I remember to use toner over the brow area first, to remove any trace of oil, the strips remove a fair amount of hair. Then, I still need to use my tweezers to remove the strays. I don't expect any brow strip to remove as much hair as a true, hot was method, without being gooey/messy!"
5,"great lipstick, great price","I love this lipstick! It's a great color for me (I'm pretty pale), but I think it would look good on anybody. And it feels good on the lip. It's not at all drying. Oh, and it lasts pretty well too. It's no 8-hour lipstick or a lip stain or anything like that, but it never proclaims to be. And, obviously, the price cannot be beat. This will always be one of my go-to lipsticks."
3,"pink, yes, but not the pink I expected","Again ladies, think u will all agree - there is a pink and again there is a PINK. Each of us have a pink in our heads, same as Lady Gaga's new line (M A C) and that is an example of another shade of pink.This is a nice pink - hope u made the right selection."
3,Blondie - Atomic,"Blondie drops da bomb on ATOMIC, featuring fresh mixes. Both Armand Van Helden and Lenny Bertoldo go for hard house, but Lenny does it just a bit better. Diddy is all HI-NRG heaven, but Xe's ""New Disco Version"" sounds suspiciously like the old disco version. The happy surprise here is a atmospheric drum 'n' bass mix by 1.8.7. -- it's nice to hear a non-house treatment."
2,Kyocera battery issue,I ordered this battery for my phone. It is not the battery it is advertised to be! I put it in my phone and it said this battery cannot be charged. What am I supposed to do? I guess buy a battery every other day when the battery dies. If this battery is not chargeable it needs to be advertised this way!!!
3,Cell Phone replacement battery purchase,"I ordered a replacement cell phone battery from Amazon bcause the cell phone store wanted to charge a lot more. I placed the order and was told it would arrive within a short time. I was given a tracking number and followed the progress. The item left California same day as ordered, and was sent to Pennsylvania, quite a bit east of me in northwestern Ohio. Then it was sent to another part of eastern Ohio, and finally to my post office in northwestern Ohio, where I picked it up. It took ONE DAY LONGER than the maximum time promised by the seller. The item was in good condition when received.I have since then ordered a book from Amazon which was sent regular mail without tracking. The book arrived in the MINIMUM time promised, so I am thinking sending via tracking needlessly delays shipments and annoys those waiting patiently for items that take longer than necessary to deliver."
5,Enlightening thinking on the human-environment relationships,"Peter Seidel's refreshing thinking on the human-environment relationships makes the 'invisible walls' that block up our way to a sustainable world visible. These 'walls' are the limits of our brain in learning the environment, the ways we have conventionally thought about and treated the nature, and the structures in which our societies have been organized. In addition to warning us the existance and the threats of the 'walls', Seidel offers us solutions to overcome the 'walls' emphasizing the importance of the responsible actions of individuals, social groups, and governments. The Invisible Walls is an excellent book with full of insights. I highly recommend it. The book should also be made available in other languages, given the global scope of the issue discussed."
3,"The product was good, but expensive and came later than it said it would",Glad it came on Christmas Eve but I was expecting it on the Saturday before Christmas and when you pay for two day service you expect it to come then.
4,Three versions.,"There are three versions of the one song. I especially like the first two.I already had Rumors by Club Nouveau, which also good, but I wanted the old original one. It is good, but it did cost me more than one would usually pay."
4,Beats EQ easily!!!,"I tried EQ, UO, and UO:TD...By far the UO and UO:TD are far better. Easier manuverability mainly. I can't stand using the keypad. Gimmie a mouse anytime!! And yes, the graphics as of now, April 2001, are not perfect. But everyday there are new patches and it gets better and better. If you think it looks bad now, you should have seen in 4 months ago. It looks 90% better. And if you have SmartMouse, you can zoom in on the creatures to see them close up. Fairies and unicorns look the best with this tool. Word of warning as well...if you don't have a high speed hook-up, it does lag considerably...So bad, a friend was being beaten by a headless one, logged off, logged onto UO itself and was able to beat it still. All in all, I do enjoy this game."
1,"What to say, what to say...","...well, I have to tell you that I for one am not impressed with this latest release. The only way I can play it with any type of speedy movement is if I'm zoomed all the way in so my character fills the whole screen. I can't see more than 3 feet in front of me.There are also numerous problems with the client itself, including a pretty bad memory leak that causes my computer to freeze up after about 20-30 minutes of play.You would need the fastest hard drive on the market, the best video card, 768mb of ram, and a 1.2Ghz CPU...then you may be able to play it for more than an hour.Many actual players of this game have to use special Memory Managers that automatically free up ram as the Windows Swap file is filled up to capacity. Ridiculous if you ask me.Since I beta tested the product, I didn't buy it (thank the lord) but take this as a word of warning...""This game is not ready for retail""."
1,"Oops, I thought this was a game.","I thought this was gonna be a cool new game. It's not. Its the same old Ultima garbage that has been around for 5 years or something. When I finally got in the game after a long install and upgrade process, I found an old style game with crappy graphics. The lighting on this game is totally stupid ugly. The characters all walk around like they have bone marrow desease. Then I started crashing. I had to reboot my system after every crash and when I was in the game, I would crash out to windows about every 10 minutes. Who are they kidding with this game? I tried some msg boards to see if I could get a fix. No way. The message boards are full of people with the same problems. Then some guy from the company msgs that you may need to check your drivers. ?? oh well. I have a brand new computer. I don't think its my computer there cisco. Nice try. I am taking this pile back to best buy."
1,uo down the drain,rennasance version of this game is 9000000x bettter dont even bother to get third dawn just stick with rennasance
1,WORST GAME EVER READ THIS,"This game started out being the best game ever created. Keywords in that sentence were ""STARTED OUT"" I was loving the game, getting rich about to get married and loving it all the same. As you most likely know this game is across the internet so like anything else that means it could get hacked and almost anyone who has played could tell you about there experience with that happening to them. In my case some loser hacked it and did some horrible things to some of my best friends. And got me to a place I wasnt aloud. Then whoever the heck it was decided to write me up (...) and now I am banned from the game until I can get the IP address changed but then Im not wasting (the money) so someone can take everything I worked my rear-end off and enjoy for themselves. Besides the fact of getting hacked, it isn't worth (the price). (...)DONT BUY WASTE OF TO MUCH MONEY GO BUY CIVILIZATION 3 a truly good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,An insult to online gaming!,"Before anyone buys this game, they should be prepared for the following: 1.) terrible lag times (and I have an extremely good system and connection) due to buggy programming 2.) sub-par ""3D"" graphics that move terribly 3.) Constant system crashes 4.) deaf Customer Support 5.) at least 5 program-driven error messages per hour. Take it from someone who tested the product numerous times, and then disposed of the game: if you want to join UO, run Ultima Online: Rennesaince instead; it's still available,a and you'll be MUCH happier with the performance and graphics."
1,Don't waste your time with this one!,"I think I wasted my money getting this one. Th graphic are the tiniest bit better to the last Ultima Online and the controls are horrific. It tokk me 10 minutes to cross a bridge, because I had got stuck between a cat and a cloaked fisherman, who didnt seem to interact or move at all. This game needs a lot of patience, and knowledge of what you are actually doing. I was walking around some village for longer than 2 hours until I came across a woman who said she could help me. abaut then the game crashes, stating an illegal operation has been caused. I might have a look at the 3D version of Ultima Oline looking for a release next year, but I defiantely wont be playing on Third Dawn again."
1,Tragic waste,"Cannot believe they are going to release this to the public as it stands. It looks awful, doesnt go for 5 minutes without crashing, lags horribly even on my 1gig Tbird with 64mb Geforce2 and cable connect. There are going to be a lot of unhappy people who buy this and then have to sit through 30 meg of patches before they can even try to play the game, and then suffer the crashes and lockups those of us in beta are still suffering. This game is not ready for release, be forewarned."
2,Some improvement,"Since I wrote my original review there have been several patches: Build # 62 has addressed some of the problems with the game and has made it *somewhat* playable. If they HAD to release a version early this should have been it. Graphics are better, the memory leak seems to be tamed; character art still needs to be improved. Give it a qualified, ""Try it."""
4,Great Game To Play,"I have been playing UO for about a year now, I started out with Third Dawn. As for the 3d aspect it just about [stinks], and I have more than the minimum requirement, but I play 2d all the time so it doesn't matter to me. If others out there want to get into UO, id recommend buying LBR (Lord Blackthorn's Revenge) just for the simple fact that you are able to access all that 3rd Dawn 3d users can access (illshenar) in 2d without the extreme lag that is encountered with 3d. I myself am getting ready to buy LBR :)"
3,A Good Start,"While this game still needs patches, as is more and more common now a days, it is a solid platform. Do not expect a complete game but dont take the sour grapes of many Beta testers too seriously."
1,why,Couldn't they just have added new lands to the old 2d game. I think the 2dgame is great but uo3d they might as well not charge a monthly fee.Save us the trouble of wasted money.
4,Rough in the box - weekly free patches,"Yes, the 3D version is still rough. The 2D version is also included, and still immerses you in the same vibrant UO community.The developers have a history of adding improvements on a weekly basis, the the game is patched free and seamlessly upon login. Don't let the rough edges fool you, the beta version improved dramatically in the 2 months before it shipped, and future improvements are sure to come. In the meantime, you can look around the Ultima world in 3D, and choose the 2D version for the most speed intensive activities."
1,Not yet ready for prime time,"This game was released too early. Probably within the next weeks/months it will stabilize as new on-line patches are released. However, for now (build 61), the game is just plain too unreliable. Some people claim to be able to run without problems, but I (and many, many others) experience client crashes every 20 minutes or so. Either buy the older UO Renaissance, or wait until this version has stabilized."
1,"Pausing to read the box was a waste of time, much less...","much less the money spent purchasing it, the headache of trying to get it to operate, and the time spent returning it to the store. It won't run, I promise. Not only that, but the support is terrible. Look to AC or EQ, or better yet one of the upcoming games like Fallen Age. Too bad EA said no to UO2."
1,Not Ready Yet...,"I totally agree with other beta testers. This product is NOT ready to be released yet. It crashes occasionally, and lags terribly. It has good graphics, and nice interface - but it should not be released at this time."
1,Wait a Year.,"UOTD was released buggy with many problems left unaddressed. There's a HORRIBLE memory leak that locks up most systems after awhile, as a beta tester it would lock crash my computer so hard I had to reboot to recover. The product has potential but was dumped into the stores 4-6 months early. It will take them a year to fix all the problems they're introducting into the game TODAY.Customer service is so bad that it's almost comical. Technical support consists of: ""Go buy a new computer."" They've ripped the heart and soul out of the Ultima mythos and replaced it with a cold and sterile 'localized' version that no one understands.Give this one a miss."
1,UOTD - the game that isn't,"This game shows wonderful promise as an extension to the original Ultima Online, but it delivers nothing. The game is seriously bugged and cannot be played for more than a few minutes on most common machines even if they meet the specs on the box.In short, don't waste your money!"
2,Lord British weeps,"It is truley sad to see how the mighty have fallen. UO, once the king of the hill for online gaming, has slunk into the ditch with this latest ""effort"". Graphically a step backward, this game sacrifices performance for badly done 3D. If you run(assuming you manage to install it) this game expect to crash often. Lag is the norm. Bugs abound, though they are patched hap-hazardly during log on to OSI servers. However, the patches themselves oft add to the problem and are patched the very next day. You may be lucky though and the game might like your hardware configuration, but doubtful. If you have problems, please expect to continue have them, customer service is not a priority for this company. If you must start an online game today, it might give you the fix you need, provided that you play with the provided 2D client, but I highly advise waiting for one of the newer online games ciming out soon."
1,Disappointed,"Where did it go. I ran to get the third CD, when I put it in I kept waiting for it to start. It didn't for me. Certainly not in any way like the first two did. Harry's got something that's magical why not leave it as it is. He doesn't need a background Strat through a Marshall for enhancement. Too bad."
5,Great shoe,I have had this shoe for a couple years and wear them to work everyday. They are comfortable and well made. I have a size 15 and they felt good right out of the box.
1,propet problem,"I received shoes and they did not fit. So i packaged them up with the only piece of paper that was enclosed. I expected some kind of return label but was none. So i wrote on invoice ""did not fit"" and mailed back. Two weeks later the package came back with ""return to sender"" all over it. And in several places it said. RETURN, NO RMA. needless to say i was unhappy to see this. I called and was pleasant and got RMA, which is return merchandise authorization. I remailed a week ago and have heard nothing so far. I real pain in the neck experience and i will never buy propet shoe again.!!!!"
5,Maine History,"This book is a must read for those who have an interest in the history of Maine and especially the lobster trade. Well written and a great summer read at the beach. Nice Christmas present for someone who is a snow bird - winters in Florida, summers in Maine. Wonderful research."
5,Superlative!,"This is an absolute must read for any Maineac like me. Highly readable. Written with style, grace, flair and humor. The total opposite of a dense historical tome. Full of fascinating history. Quite wonderful."
1,Create settings for your scenes,"Old product. Works only with Windows 98 or older. Great for setting up scenes in 6 formats (Thanksgiving, farm, etc.), tho. Beware for virus!"
3,Rules Book for sharing a vacation house,The book was ok but only described one family's process and rules for managing a co-owned house. I was looking for many examples of different approaches that various families had tried and what were advantages and disadvantages of each.
5,Fantastic,When you hear this CD it reminds you of those smokey joints up in Harlem where the music & dancing never stop. THE BEST!!!
3,Micky has done a good job...not a great one....,"this album is certainly not great ,but enjoyable to dance.I believe there was a rush on this album ,I am also certain that the next one will definitely be a knock out ...because he's incredibly talented."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book based on the reviews i read here and the description and had high hopes for this book and was sorely disappointed.This is definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. The story lacked development, depth and believability.Truely a horrible read"
5,Personal Experience with Panda,We were just in Sichuan Province and visited the panda reserve! The pandas were awesome and so was the movie. My son just love panda bears
2,"Some Beautiful Locations, but...","I always try to keep an open mind about films, and always will. But, give me a break. I am reminded of when Tigger wrecked rabbits house, rabbit said, ""Why oh why oh why!"" I think his head hurt too. That pretty much sums it up. Every film, including this one, takes an effort. It's just that this has been done so many countless times, and I crave originality. Give me something new."
2,Not Amazing,"The product of broken home, 10-year-old Ryan Tyler (Ryan Slater) takes a plane trip all by himself to China, where he hops on a tour bus and finds himself in the lush bamboo forests on an amazing adventure to rescue a baby panda taken by poachers. A mix of real and animatronic critters were used to portray the black and white marsupial. Very young children might enjoy it - others, seek your adventures elsewhere.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,Children's Live Action,"I LOVED this movie as a child! It was probably one of the only live action movies I enjoyed until I was 10 or so... People may be offended by the nudity in this movie, as a child I was not bothered but it is best for parents to decide whether or not a movie is appropriate beforehand anyway. Perhaps the part about this movie that impacted me the most was the other culture shown in it. It opened me up to the world!"
2,Amazing Panda Adventure,"The preview and promotion was somewhat misleading. I found the story suitable for children up to 10. A young boy going off alone in an area totally unfamiliar to him, escaping the kidnappers or in this case, 'panda nappers' who had guns, carrying the panda cub and miraculously being found by his father, a great story for boys especially."
5,Great family movie for all to see!,I loved this movie when I saw it and can recommend it for the whole family to enjoy for an evening together. One of my favorites of all time. I am a grandmother and shared with my grandson and he loved it. The experiences with the broken home are real to today's world and shows how healing can come. A must see movie for the hour we are living in. Fun and adventure and pictures are beautiful.
3,Triple feature,i was pleased with the collection of stories regarding our environment and animals. I purchased the item for my son who has a disability and he loved the humor in Born to be wild. We both enjoyed the stories situated in China and Alaska. The beauty of Alaska was well represented. The different ways in which the youths in the movies responded to the challenges they faces were inspiring. It is a good collection of stories for children who are old enough to understand the relationship of cause and effect. We enjoyed watching them just for the entertainment and they were great openings for other discussions on character and more.
5,DVD purchase,This is the DVD that I wanted at a good price. It shipped quickly to my home and worked fine was in good condition.
5,Amazing Panda Adventure,My 3yr old grandsons favorite movie!! It was in perfect condition!!! We lost his original and was so happy to find it on Amazon!!
4,Great family fun!,"On a visit to an older relative, we learned to play this game. Since then, we take the game as we travel and over to friends homes and play it in small or big groups. Simple enough to be played by younger kids, and has enough finesse to have possible playing strategies for us mature players. We usually laugh a lot when we play this. Although it's not strictly educational game, it helps you to learn to add. I have a lot of great memories associated with this game already. Inexpensive, but a great value, makes a great gift for people who love to play games."
3,"Lots of fun, but not ""intense""","This product is fun, but is not ""intense"" as the game says. My 13 year-old grandson and I played several games. It is educational because you have to add large numbers."
2,What century?,"I thought Great Train Disasters but it wasn't, what a disappointment. A re-hash of train history in 50 mins with not a single modern disaster in sight. Barely made it into the 1900's. Why pay the price when you get whole box sets for a little more? Not good value for the dollar."
5,This book opened up a whole new world for me...,"Michael's excellent book is thorough, well-organized, entertaining and EXTREMELY useful. I had no previous experience in musical theater, let alone long-form improvised sketch comedy, but I really love it, and ""Musical Direction for Improv and Sketch Comedy"" has been an incredible boost in my learning curve.There are also elements and rules in the book that can be applied to composing for film, television, commercials, and just plain songwriting and performing - creating a mood, underscoring, segues, becoming familiar with many styles and genres, etc. Any and every working musician can glean something useful from Pollock's book.It's the closest substitute to having Michael Pollock as a personal mentor, and that's saying something."
5,Great Game!!,"My six year old really enjoys this game and plays with it non-stop. She's loves everything about the game and has learned SO much about geography (states, state capitals, etc.), but mainly loves the fact that she's challenged..unlike some of the games that are labled for 1-2nd grade which she sometimes finds too easy."
5,Great price and TV,"I did several hours of research and found this TV to be a great Price and the Quality is astonishing. I would reccomend this to anyhone on a budget or that wants a great resolution without breaking the piggy bank.Its 22"" out from the wall so looks nicer is you have an entertainment unit to snug this into. We don't and it still looks great.The Surround sound is good I wouldn't callit great because my Sony Theatre from 3 years ago (Entry Level Surround) is better IMO but I am still testing out the various equalization modes to see if I like it better one way than the other. I purchased direct from Philips and the delivery time was better than they projected.I paid 799.00 for mine and shipped to the door after tax was 957.00I do rec. this product its easy to set up, clean, and install."
3,Problems getting this TV to power on,"This TV came with the doublewide I bought. It turned on OK the first few times I used it, but then when I tried to turn it on, the power button would just flash and the screen would never show anything.When I called Philips, they first said to unplug it for 5 minutes and plug it back in. The set came on that time, but the next day I had the same problem again and unplugging didn't fix it. I called Philips again, and this time they said to disconnect the extension cord I was using. This worked again for a couple of times, then the problem showed up again.This time Philips told me that this TV requires a signal from an antenna to power up reliably. I can't easily do this right now as the doublewide manufacturer cut off the connector on the coaxial cable that was installed for cable/satellite TV. So I'm stuck until the fixit crew comes to correct the problems."
2,A different definition of beginner,Without TAB's or fingerboard diagrams of the demonstrated material it is very difficult for a beginner to pick up the licks and techniques. The close up of the hands does not adequately define the strings being fretted nor the strings being picked. All in all it is probably pretty good for someone who can pick up these things from watching a guitarist in concert.
2,Far too advanced for me to pick up on.,The author showed impressive guitar licks that he plays so fast that I can't see where his fingers are positionioned.
3,A little too advanced,The product is ok but its just a little too advanced. At least for me it was. Keep it for later on when I hopefully will get better.
4,BK is an awesome hard house DJ,"After just getting back from a rave where he spun I picked up Euphoria:Extreme. With 36 tracks on it, it is totally worth the $$$ spent. Each song is worth listening and dancing to and making it feel likes its a rave in your own home. Straight from the UK, BK is one to look for...."
5,"Great Show, Great DVD",Love the show and loved the DVD though i do wish we could have gotten some more Extras like Commentary on Episodes..Overall though its a must buy for Fans of the show..
4,Where is the Blu-ray?!,"Love Glee, was hooked after my daughter made me watch the first episode (Directors Cut). Love the DVD release but why, oh why isn't this on Blu-ray? It's broadcast in HD so maybe it's going to be a 'gotcha, buy me again' in 2010."
5,A magnificent show of 2009,"I was fairly sceptical if I would like it, thinking it would end up being a kiddy show like High School Musical. I really didn't get involved with the series until I saw episode 9 (Wheels). The songs were well sung and re-written for tv. Most of all the acting was SUBERB. I won't give away any spoilers to those who havn't seen it, but I think this is well on it's way to an emmy award."
1,very poor video quality,"Terrific programs, but the video quality on these DVDs is very poor. Faces are a blurry mess. The motion of many people dancing on screen in a group causes all of the dancers to look like plastic puppets. You can't see any detail. The lighting effects during some musical numbers also cause horrible video distortion. It is very frustrating to watch, and reduces how much I would have otherwise enjoyed it."
3,"Nice fun, a couple of note-worthy characters..","It is a live-action cartoon. (Exhibit A: the cheerleading teacher appears on TV, telling the audience that ""caning works"". Exhibit B: the chorus teacher has his pay lowered, for asking to teach glee club. How ""arch"" can you get? Exhibit C: they have a kid in a wheelchair, used for the most obviously-tacky choreography that you could do with him. The joke rivals Mel Brook's ""We Love Bialy"" number, in ""The Producers,"" for audacity. Exhibit D: in the pilot, the new chorus teacher blackmails a kid with pot-related threats, to get him into glee club. That's practically a boycott-the-show sort of subplot, and they still did it. Wild.)If you can get into the foolishness, there's a lot of fun here. The numbers are good - great if you like that sorta thing - and the comic timing is sometimes brilliant, especially when Jane Lynch flies onto the scene. (They've got a great combination of actress / writers, in that character. Ms. Lynch is a writer's dream.)"
1,Try your public library for now and wait for the full season on DVD for later,"I'm a big Glee fan - I bought the soundtracks right away, and I was tempted to buy this partial DVD season, but after reading several reviews here, and learning that there is no discount voucher provided for the later full-season purchase, I will wait FOX out and not waste my money.As a public library employee at the Jersey Shore - may I make a suggestion: check your local library for this DVD release and SAVE YOUR MONEY! My library has this set available to loan to our patrons, and I will get my Glee fix for free! Why should I spend my hard-earned money twice? Sorry, FOX, this is shady, to say the least. I trusted that the rumored voucher would materialize, showing your good faith toward the Glee fans."
1,"Great show, horrible release","I have no problems with Glee, but Fox's decision to release a Season 1, Volume 1 halfway through the series is such a pathetic attempt at a quick cash grab. Just wait another 6 months and buy the full season 1 DVD when it is released at the end of the season. Don't go in for this kind of BS. New Line and your upcoming theatrical Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray release, I'm looking at you!"
1,"Excellent show, wasteful DVD","I am a huge fan of Glee and was so excited for the release of the DVD that I was even willing to buy it twice (once the second part of the seasons comes out at least). However I was seriously disappointed when I received it. My favorite part of a DVD is always the Extra features and I must say that these are seriously lacking! First of all, every so called feature is less than a minute long and they start off with some incredibly bizarre informative video by Principal Figgins. They are followed by redundant heavily edited interviews that are very short. There are no commentaries, meet the cast, understanding costuming, anything that would NORMALLY be found on a DVD release. Needless to say I am not thrilled with it and I seriously hope they put out some better stuff when they release the rest of the season."
2,Doesn't seem to work properly on my Blu-Ray player,"I'm not a fan of the show, but my wife loves it. Gave it to her for Christmas; she gave me a good Samsung Blu-Ray player. Portions of DVD #1 will randomly freeze and the video will deteriorate every few minutes. Extremely annoying. We exchanged the set for a new one; same problem, different parts of the set. I've watched dozens of regular DVDs on this player with no issue. All I can think is that they rushed this set out the door with inferior quality disks.Note--we tried the set on a standard DVD player and it seems to work just fine. Buyer beware."
1,glee season one,my daughter ordered this dvd not realising it was for american dvd players.we also had to pay 12. 86 at the post office before we could get it. our own fault not the sellers. we'll have to be more careful next time.
3,Blu Ray of GLEE?!? Where are you?,"I Love this show. I would give it five stars but this product is only on SD DVD. Come on FOX, it airs in HD...I've seen all of the episodes in beautiful HD and now I can only watch a standard def, DVD? No thanks...I'll wait and hope that FOX wises up.BTW, now that musical comedy dramas are in demand...let's bring back ""Rags to Riches"" on DVD from 1987. That will always be a classic in my book!"
1,Bait and Switch: Not a way for FOX to install customer loyalty,"Bait and Switch: for those of us who purchased Glee: Season One, Volume 1 - Road to Sectionals back in December 2009 when it was first released are left having to pay for it again if we want to see Glee: The Complete First Season. What a ripoff. Not to mention immoral."
5,Glee 1st Season,Excellent! I love Glee as it is very refreshing! I will watch this more than once. If you like Glee-get this set of the 1st season!
4,Gleefully great,"Product was recieved quickly (with super saver shipping), in excellent conditioncouldn't of asked fr morewas bought as birthday present for sister who turned 17 and she loved it!Also priced great!"
2,Poor Delivery,"Ordered The Item on the 14th of December with expedited delivery and it is now the 20th and still have not received the item, glad I wasted the money on that expedited delivery!!!!!"
3,"Great show, disappointing DVD","I love this show, but this DVD is a real let-down. It has absolutely nothing new in the extras other than a somewhat amusing tour of the school by the principal. All the other extras are things we've already seen on Hulu and Youtube, and they haven't even been upgraded to DVD resolution here! There are no episode commentaries. Honestly, they could have put in a lot more effort. What a missed opportunity."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I watched the first episode of this show because I was bored. I didn't expect much. I am sooooo glad I was bored that day!This is a great show. It is definitely not your typical high school show as it doesn't showcase the popular kids. This is the high school show that showcases the rest of us-- the handicap kids, the over achievers, the geeks, the gay kids, the big girls, the pregnant teens-- the high school outcast population. The show is funny and heartfelt, and the music is often better than the original versions of the songs.My only complaint is that I don't know how far this can be taken. I can see a season for sectionals (this season), a season for regionals, a season for state, and a season for nationals. I can't see it lasting longer than that and that makes me sad."
2,"Love this show, glad I bought the season pass.","As others have said before me, buying this first installment would only be worthwhile if the second installment was only the last nine episodes. If you buy the season pass on iTunes, it includes all the first episodes and the episodes that started airing in April. Sooo, if you plan to spend $30 when the DVD comes out, you can have each episode as it's available by buying the season pass from iTunes."
5,Fantastic,"This is such a fantastic show! Generally, I don't have time to watch TV since my schedule is jam-packed, but I almost always make time for Glee. I just got the DVD in the mail today. It is amazing."
1,Ripoff- do not buy,"Do NOT buy this release! I repeat, do NOT buy it!!!! Now I do not actually own the set. I love Glee, I am someone who loves musical theatre and if you are a true thespian you will enjoy it greatly. However, if you are going to buy the show, WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER OR AT LEAST THE FALL. It's true that fox originally opted for thirteen episodes, but since the show's ratings went thru the roof, the decided to add nine more episodes to the mix. They also contradicted themselves by saying they'd release the full season on DVD. Therefore this release is a complete scam and ripoff, and not worth the effort to go out and buy. Do NOT give into Fox's scam, people. Just wait for the fall box set release."
1,A monumental work,This is a monumental work which should be republished. Unfortunately when I originally sought to purchase it through Amazon it was for sale at $300. Then the supplier decided not to send it to me. Within a few days it was back and more than double the price? This is a disgrace and shows how unreliable some suppliers can be of difficult to find books.
2,"""Boring, with a capital 'B'""","""Gadji,"" by Louise Domaratius, takes the grand prize in the most BORING book of the year category. In a nutshell...Boring marriage to a boring husband, coupled with the empty-nest syndrome, outcome...older woman meets younger man. End of story!"
2,Not the wonderful Hootie I am used to.,"I own four other albums and all of them are great. When I pop in a Hootie CD I expect to be relaxed by the soothing voice and the familiar sound that accompany one of my all time favorite bands. I buy CD's and keep those CD's on the premise that the entire CD is worth keeping. I am not buying a CD for one or two songs, but the CD as a whole. I just bought this album the other day. Half of the songs had the familiar feel but the rest could go to waste. I am giving it a 2.5, because half the album is great."
4,Back on track,"It took them longer than most of us wanted, but Hootie and The Blowfish finally have new music on the market. After many people alienated them in 96, they have went many different ways musically on their albums. This one finds them returning to the sounds on thier debut disc ""Cracked Rear View"". Although the best song on the album ""Space"" is also the shortest, there is plenty of juice elsewhere in the package. The only thing I have a problem with is that ""Alright"" is a 'hidden' track. Why? It is easily one of the best tunes on the disc, why not give it a track of it's own? I must admit, it took a few listens to get the 'groove' back, but I finally dig it. Not only have they reclaimed the sound that 'broke' them to the world, but they are still exploring new stuff, check out ""Little Brother"", it becomes addicting.....For the droves of people that ran away after hearing ""Fairweather Johnson"" in 96, it's okay, we'll let you come back. And you will, just give this new record a listen."
2,Darius loses his voice,"Gotta agree with few here. I had to listen HARD to make sure that was Darius singing. I don't know what was done, but his voice in this project has been polished or honed down to anybody's voice. Nothing really stands out here except for the infectious Little Brother.Not much replayability for me."
5,Three times through,"By the third listen of Hootie's new CD, I was absolutely hooked. From beginning to end, as good if not better than anything they've ever done. It gets better & better with each run through. I can't wait for the tour. Favorites include everything on the CD. A must have !"
1,horrible,"Could it be?Could it?Why yes, I think it is.The year's most irrelevant album.And it's only March.Let me cast my vote now for the most irrelevant album"
2,new to me Hootie,"just ""okay"" CD. I like Hootie, and when I was needing to make a sample Amazon purchase I picked this CD, unknown to me at the time. It certainly isn't full of winners. I've listened to it twice and none ""stick in my head"". The lyrics and beats of the Hootie I'm used to just weren't there."
4,Best CD since the first one and one of the best in 2003!,"I bought this cd the first day it was released and when i first heard it i ithought it was dull..but when i listened to it again and heard ""innocence"" i was in total awe!!i'm a musician that has been playing for awhile now and it takes alot to impress me these days .but i haven't recalled myself being addicted to a song like this in years!!i play it at least 4 or 5 five times a day and i hear music at its finest!!Ihavent listened to Hootie since 97 and forgot about them. But now i cant belive that i did!!This is their finest since cracked rear view and maybe surpasses it by a hair.For all you Hootie fans,you'll probably agree and for all you ex-Hootie fans,but this one you'll know why you liked them before!!songs like Innocence,Deeper side,Space,I'll come runnin',Tears fall down will get stuck in your head and youll be singing along with them!!Hootie is back!!"
2,"Best song is the ""hidden"" track","I'm a fan of Hootie's other albums, but this is a dud--one bland, vanilla track after another. It sounded more to me like an early effort, before they hit their stride, but no! The songwriting is stale, and no tune ""hooked"" me, until the final bonus track, ""Alright"": _that_ one I wanted to listen to again and again (hence the 2 stars). So, if you don't have their other albums, I'd suggest starting anywhere else first."
2,time for Darius Rucker to keep stepping,"after hearing Darius Rucker drop His Solo Album on ""Hidden Beach"" Records last year I felt then it was time for Him to keep going as a Solo Artist&after hearing this Formula Based Music again it's truly time to let the Band thing go except for a few songs.""Little Brother"" is a tight song&arguably could have been a tight Duet with Darius Rucker&Ben Harper if released as a Duet.but the rest of this Album is pretty much been there&down that&unlike 9 years ago there is nothing that speaks of surprising people anymore.the Formula has gone on 2-3 Albums to many."
2,not worth listening to,"okay first of all, musical chairs was a damn good album...this album couldnt hold a candle to it or any of hooties other albums for that matter....nuff said...dont buy it cause if u do..then youll be selling it fast for 3 bucks at the local independent records store.."
1,Don't waste your money,Darius has lost his soulfullness (too bad) - too country rock sounding! I'm sorry I spent my money on it.
1,So...What...did the McDonald's close?,"""Hootie & The Blowfish Are Back"" we are told. Great. Can YOU can ""forgotten but not gone?"""
1,DRIVVLE > POINTLESS >,I think it is bands like Hootie and the Blowfish that have ruined the record industry and are a complete waste of musical space.
1,Let US Cry,"The one-hit-wonders should finally hang it up, as evidenced on their self-titled HOOTIE & THE BLOWFISH.Fittingly, most of the songs do ""blow,"" as they say, and there's very little substance to the band still trying to find their way back to Kansas.Hang it up, boys. The party was over several years ago."
2,a tad uncomfortable,"I liked the premise of the story as described in the previous reviews. I liked Sabrina Bennett. I liked Hunter, our hero the Earl of Greystone. But what I did not like was the constant references to Sabrina'a age, 18. Yes, Hunter was in his early 30's, I think 32 or 34. Yes, he was older. But she came across as a teenager. He referred to her throughout the book as a child, as ""little one"". Rather off putting, especially in bedroom play. Not that there was lots of that. Why did Ms. Brown employ her age to such distraction? Why make the age issue such an issue? It really took away from the story for me. Even in the bedroom scenes, she was wearing modest, high neck, white cotten nightgowns. Because she was really a girl, not a woman and thus, should have been left in the nursery."
5,Nice buy for the money,I have found this to be the best tea extract out there for the money. I have tried several that didnt seem as potent or have an effect but this one is excellent
4,I don't notice any difference.,I don't feel any different but I've lost 5 lbs. in a month. I've been exercising a couple times a week too.
4,So far so good,"I've been taking this product for about 10 days and have had no adverse reactions - whether I take it with or without food. I am using it for the purpose of its antioxidant benefits, so it's not really a weight loss thing for me. However, if weight loss happens to occur, I certainly won't complain!"
1,Avoid this company,"I tried to cancel my order and they refused saying it had already shipped (this was over a week since I had ordered it), which was fine. But, when I checked on shipment, it did not ship until the day it was suppose to arrive at my house. I will NEVER use this company again."
3,Not the best decaffeination process,I called the company because my concern is how they decaffeinate their product and I was disappointed that they used some solvent (ethanol in the process) rather than the safer CO2 process. So I ordered ECGC from NOW and its fairly decaffeinated only 4 mg of caffeine and they use the CO2 method. Do your research. I think if you are going to take something for your health then it should not have residues which may be undesirable.
3,Nothing yet,"Purchased it hoping for weight loss. Even with diet and exercise, I see no difference. That's why I bought it. Hoping it would help.I will probably try the green coffee bean ultra as suggested by Dr. Oz."
3,Not working like the others,I used to use this brand and had better results 6 months ago. I do not recommend these for energy or weight loss.
1,Causes nausea,"I was very excited to find a quality green tea extract. Unfortunately, every time I take it, I get very nauseous. I felt this way for 5 days straight after I began taking it so I stopped taking it for 4 days during which I had absolutely no nausea at all. The very first time I tried taking it again, I was extremely nauseous within the hour. I've even tried taking directly with food, doesn't help. I have read that polyphenols can cause nausea so I'm guessing it is the high percentage that is to blame."
2,need caffeine,just wish it had the caffeine for that jump start feeling. I'm not sensitive to it so I definitely need it. I accidently purchased it without realizing that it was decaffeinated.
1,Product details lacking detail,The product details for this product fail to state how many mg EGCG are in each capsule. How can anyone buy supplements online without knowing this very basic info?
4,Works for me.,I initially didn't buy into the hype surrounding these pills. I decided to give them a shot after reading 4HR body. I really like them now. I enjoy drinking tea but I don't always have the time. If I am in a hurry I just pop one of these pills instead and I get the same benefits. Definitely worth trying.
4,"For students of Peruvian culture, ceramics or interior desig","I am continually impressed by the outstanding layout, photos and supportive text that the Fowler Museum of Cultural History produces; and this wonderfully enlightening book, Ceramics of Ancient Peru, is no exception.Dr. Donnan takes you on a chronological journey from the Ancient Peruvian ceramic techniques (1800 B.C.) through the Florescent Period (period of ceramics in the Moche Kingdom 100 B.C.-700 AD) to end with the Inca and Colonial period (1430 - 1660 AD). For those that are students of Peruvian culture, ceramics or interior decorating, this book will be a prized possession. Recommended"
5,Very impressed....,"If you are looking to take advantage of dropping 720p DLP TV's (due to the 1080p series out now) this is the Unit for you! For under $1000, this TV offers great quality for the price. Like Most DLPs, this unit has some limitations (you need to be at eye level for best picture and the sound quality is just average - but that applies to all TVs) but the picture is gorgeous. HD looks amazing, and the adjustable viewing modes allow you to tailor it to your likes/dislikes (Softness, brightness, etc.)- so you should be happy with your picture every time you watch it! compared to the Samsung 50"" 720p model at the store, I was actually more impressed with the brightness on this TV and it was over 300 dollars less! In addition, it has every hookup imaginable (3 HDMI) so it should work well with just about any setup. I have been a Toshiba enthusiast since our first 32"" tube TV 10 years ago (Which is still alive and well!) and I find their quality and affordability to be the best out there!"
2,Good at first . . .,"I bought this TV and had it delivered August 2, 2007. There's a one year warranty on it. Surprise! One month after the warranty expired, loud pop and the lamp blew. It's a ""user replaceable"" part, but one that has to be ordered. Looks like the cost is about $200. So factor that in to the price of the TV when you buy!"
4,Vai...at his shredding..ecclectic best,"This cd..albeit brief..is Steve Vai showing that he can do whatever he chooses..and his fans will buy..only he would dare try to pull this off..each track offers insight into that contries tradition and style of old world music...recorded live during his Ultra Zone tour..this music is inspired by some of the greatest cities in the world...just check out ""Black Forest"" or ""The Power of Bombos"" your stereo will fear for it's life...!! Granted some of it is a little out there for U.S fans..but it's everything you expect from Steve Vai..."
3,Steve takes us on another ride,"Here's the deal: CD#1 Very good, CD#2 not so good. But the last song, ""Brandos Costumes"" (Gentle Ways) is so beautiful, and it contains some of his best playing anywhere!!! His acoustic guitar playing is full of the best of everything we love about this man's music. I think Steve's eclecticism sometimes baffles many of his fans. Sometimes you have to sift through his records for the gems that are there. You may not like everything, but when he delivers, oh he delivers!!!!"
5,"Steve, Un Artista de 5 estrellas","Bueno..es dificil resumir este disco en solo unos pocos renglones.., creo que este disco es para fanaticos..para gente que realmente aprecie el trabajo de steve, es impresionante...para la gente que lo vio en vivo.., con este disco recuerda esos momentos, ya que el pone todas los pequeños detalles que ocurren durante el show.., por ejemplo..(rompe una cuerda , se va de tono..etc..).., nos sorprende con la ternura de whispering a prayer en vivo en Buenos Aires.., y con la furia de incantantion en vivo en bulgaria. El disco representa a lo largo de la gira de The Ultra Zone, la cultura de diferentes paises..lo que el hace es tocar una cancion nueva en cada pais, representado algo de ese pais.. Por eso digo que este disco es para gente que le guste mucho steve.. Lo recomiendo ampliamente,..ademas aparezco en la contratapa!!(tercera fila , al medio) ..ya que la contratapa es la foto del teatro Gran Rex en buenos Aires.. Espero que les haya servido mi comentario saludos!"
2,"we need another ""PASSSION AND WARFARE""","hi everybody.i'd like to share some thoughts about the new album of steve vai.come on steve!!! i have been always waiting for ur 7th song of each album.but this time the 7th song was very bad.where r ur feelinsg on guitar?we need another ""for the love of god"" othrise i m asking for the ""for the love of god"" of the new century.still ur groundbreaking album is passion andwarfare.we need u to come back again and strong."
1,quality lacking,"I purchased this for my wife for Mother's day. The package arrived in tough shape. Part of the wood on the back piece had broken off and three of the screws that held one of the wood arm rests had snapped in half. I called to order replacement parts. They just arrived yesterday in a very beat up box. Actually, they sent entire bench. Surprisingly, the bench was intact (with only minor scrapes on the wood arm rests). BTW, customer service associated with obtaining the replacement parts was good.I left the original bench up and the finish on the wood seat pieces has [b]already[/b] deteriorated significantly. I would not recommend this bench."
3,Not for the Great Outdoors,"I love the bench, but the finish is wearing off after only 2 weeks outside. It's in a shaded area, but exposed to the heavy rains we've been having in the northeast. I passed by it today in a rare moment of dry weather, and noticed the wood finish has practically worn away on the seat as well as the back. I wouldn't rate this as a great outdoor product. It might do well under a porch or gazebo, but if you expose it to the elements, good luck!"
2,Cheap price - cheap quality,The wooden slats were not properly planed nor finshed. My bench has not fared well in the elements either. I expect this to last me about two years before I toss it.
3,Not as bad as you might think.....,"Muhammed Ali, acting, and 1977 might all have added up to a recipe for disaster, but the overall result is rather entertaining. I saw this movie on the late show and ended up watching the whole thing. Movie traces Alis career from his Olympic victory to the George Foreman fight in Zaire. Unlike some of the media reviews above, I thought Ali made a fine actor, mostly because he was playing his larger-than-life self. Some scenes had the feel of a documentery, as Ali's quips fly a mile a minute. Ali deserves credit for portraying some of his flaws as well. Not suprisingly, the boxing scenes consist of actual footage. A not-too-shabby supporting cast includes Robert Duvall, James Earle Johnes and Ernest Borgnine. Paul Winfield and John Amos also have brief roles. Overall, it's a good capsule of Ali's razor-sharp wit and charisma that unfortunately has been silenced by Parkinsons disease....."
4,the REEL Ali,"After listening to the audio book Sound & Fury from Blackstone Audio, this bio pix of Ali is a wonderful self promotion.This 1977 movie had a great cast of actors. Such names as James Earl Jones as Malcolm X, Lloyd Haynes as Herbert Mohamad, Ernest Borgnine as Dundee, John Marley as Ferdy, Roger Mosby as Sonny Liston in minor roles. There are also cameos from Robert Duval, Paul Winfield, Ben Johnson, and David Huddleston. All this creative talent playing against Ali. Ali isnt acting, he is being himself...but himself works.They skip over his religious beliefs in this film to focus on his career.Lets be honest, the film isnt a great film..its music is wonderful. The film is minor in scope and its major starred cast.This movie is for real boxing fans who love films like Rocky, The champ and Digsstown, this is great to add to the DVD film libraryBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
4,Big Fights Inc. always delivers.,Excellent fight footage and the always controversial Bert Sugar lead to a enjoyable 60 minutes of action. Bill Cayton and Bert Sugar go head to head to try to decide who is the best Pound for Pound. Since Big Fights Inc. has the largest collection of fight films the is no shortage of great fighters and fight action. A must have for the serious fight fan and enough fight action for the viewer to form their own opinion on who was the best pound for pound.
3,Chip McAllister,"I think that the actor that portrayed Muhammad Ali as an adolescent, in The Greatest, did a fantastic job. Whatever happened to him? I think his name was Chip McAllister"
4,Chip Mcalister,"Chip was excellent in this movie and I know what happened to him. I ran into him in San Clamente, Ca and ate lunch with him. He seems to be doing very well. Good actor and good guy. 11/16/02"
2,Not very helpful,Nothing new here. Seems to be a re-write of the ideas in Cicely Berry's books on speaking Shakespeare. Was looking for some new insights. Did not find any.
4,Astonica Garden Frog Birdbath,"This was easy to put together. The instructions are very simple. It has a heavy stand so it doesn't tip over. Once the water is in the birdbath and it is plugged in, the water comes out of the frog's mouth and flows over the lily pad. It is really a cute birdbath."
1,Frog Bird Bath,"First a few unique washers were missing. I called the customer service number and was told ""...I'll let them know..."" Who is ""them...."" THEY NEVER CAME...Finally I sent Bird Bath Back....Amazon might want to talk to these people..POOR customer service..in fact..NONEXISTENT!!..A few washers missing and the whole thing leakes...Ashame..it seems like a nice piece..."
3,Again he's looking for true country music but can he find it,"What happened. You have a career record with Everywhere follow it up with the equally impressive but poppish A Place in the Sun, and where do you find yourself Setting a circus down. What is this, not true country music. Tim should take a page from Brad Paisley and Part II and quit letting Faith influence his style of music. Well I will have to say three stars because to me it's an average albumn and being the open minded person I am to today's style of country music I am one to agree that there are some good songs on this albumn, but not something that I would write home about. Telluride, Things Change, Grown Men Don't Cry, Set this Circus down, and a couple more are very good radio hits needless to say but there not the type of music that Nashville needs to get back to the true roots that country has so strongly strayed from."
2,"Tim, YOU ARE NOT Faith","Some songs on this disc are good-country songs. Like 'things change"" which talks about Hank and Elvis and the fact that some people say his music is too pop. Well, Tim has proved them right with this ""faith-esque"" release. If you like Faith Hill's pop you will like Set this Circus Down. If you like country and Tim's earlier stuff, you probably won't. One shiny spot is his rendition of Bruce Robison's Angry All the Time. Which still falls short of Robison's version."
2,Disappointing,"When I heard the first few lines of the first cut (""The Cowboy in Me""), I thought ""Sounds good."" But I wasn't very far into this CD before I was feeling pretty disappointed. The things that have made me a Tim McGraw fan are his keen sense of how to pick good songs and the poignancy in his delivery of those songs. Both of those seem to be lacking for most of this CD. With the exception of a few songs, everything else seems to sound alike - that commercialized, countryish rock. McGraw does hit the mark with ""Angry All the Time"" and ""Grown Men Don't Cry."" But I think I'll put this CD on the shelf and keep listening to ""Everywhere"" instead."
2,"Help! Tim forgot what ""COUNTRY"" music is !!!","Ok, I could deal w/ & even enjoyed some of Tim McGraws' previous CD's but ""Set This Circus Down"" is a circus that needs to be shut down , closed and never reopened.I think he's made a cheesy mix of poorly produced country~pop i.e.,(ANGEL BOY) w/ the exception of the thought provoking ""Angry All The TIme"" & only country tinged ""Cowboy In Me"". If he wants to be remembered like HANK, The POSSOM,HAGGARD...He'd better get in that studio & seriously think about what he wants from his music career. Bring out the ""cowboy in (TIM)""!!! :)"
5,Awesome!,I think this is one of his best albums. There is not one song on this album that I don't like.
1,HE DOESN'T WRITE THE SONGS,"Normally I can tolerate Tim Mcgraw because he sounds good. Then I realized that he doesn't write any of his own songs. He buys them from songwriters, unlike himself, and sings them in his twangy voice. Don't waste your time with him or his wife or any of Nashville's talent. Instead, listen to Johnny Cash, or older artists with soul and the ability to write a song from the heart, not the pocketbook."
1,Please Save Your Money!!!!!!,"Well, one would be anxious to get their hands on the new cd Set This Circus Down by Tim McGraw because of the superb Things Change that is on this CD, but here is the head spinner this cd is his worst cd and the worst cd I have heard in a long time. The Cowboy In Me is ok, TELLURIDE is so so, You Get Used To Me is so so, Unbroken is one of the songs that do make this cd look good (and then this isn't that great), Things Change definitley is the only song that makes this a 1 star cd the song Things Change is a 5 star but without this song on the CD it is a 0 star. Angel Boy is the worst on this cd the beginning has no feeling...."
5,The best yet!!!,"He just keeps getting better. I can listen to this CD like all his others from beginning to end every day and never grow tired of it. Faith Hill really adds a wonderful dimension to the sound of his music on the cuts where she sings backup. I don't know if Tim and Faith read reviews like this, but if you do keep doing what you're doing. You really touch a lot of people with your music."
4,"Good, but not up to Tim's standards","I have been a Tim McGraw fan since early '93. I own all six of his previous albums, most, like this one, bought on the day they were released. If I had reviewed this the first day I had it I would have given it a 3. After listening a few times (I've had it on continuously for 5 days now) it gets better, but still not up to the same caliber of the previous albums, all of which I would easily rank as 5 stars. I am a fan of his ballads and though there are plenty on this album, I prefer a more country sound. ""The Cowboy in Me"" is one of the best cuts on the album. ""Let Me Love You"" and the already released ""Things Change"" and ""Grown Men Don't Cry"" are pretty good. All of the songs are decent, lacking only in a country sound, though some have a country feeling. Overall, I would say buy the album, it is after all Tim McGraw."
2,Set This Circus Down,"Uhm...where should I start? Well, there's only a few tolerable songs on here. ""Angry all the Time"" sounds like the best stuff McGraw's ever done, but I've heard Robison's version and McGraw's just doesn't come close. If your looking for a ""country"" album to buy, this is not it. Don't beleive all the popularity and hype about Tim McGraw. Circus is filled with weak songs that all sound the same. This guy really needs to use a wider variety of instruments and different styles of songs. It seems like its the same thing over and over...a fast 80's pop-rock song, then a slow 80's pop-rock song. Maybe some mid-tempo songs, some neat changes in rhythm, different backing instruments...stuff like that would help McGraw make decent music."
4,Excellent disc,"I bought this disk just to hear The Cowboy in Me - but I fell in love so many other songs too. This disk has some catchy songs on it, and some real heartfelt songs too. I have fallen in love with Things Change (#5), and You Get Used to Somebody (#3).If you like Tim in general, then you'll love this. If you're not familiar with him, think Garth with a bit less umph! (I hope that helps!)"
2,Long Awaited but Very disappointing,"I am so upset. I waited and waited for this CD because of my great love for Tim's music. If you are like me, you play Tim's other CD's all the time and still enjoy the songs no matter how much you have heard them. This is not the case here. I have tried VERY hard to like this CD, but I cannot get into it. None of the songs have that special McGraw ""kick"" to them. They are dull and lifeless, with the exceptions of ""Telluride"" and ""Grown Men.""I keep trying to convince myself to keep this CD to have a full McGraw collection. It isn't worth the money."
3,Tim McGraw Looking To Broaden His Audience,"Following in the footsteps of his talented wife McGraw has matured his sound a little to reach a larger audience. When I first heard the song ""Grown Men Don't Cry"" I was really excited to hear this new sound from McGraw. Many of the songs on ""Set This Circus Down"" are easy listening love ballads. Faithful fans might be turned off by this new sound, but I enjoy it and believe many others will enjoy it also. Hopefully this new album will inroduce a whole new audience to the music of Tim McGraw. Definitely one of my favorite country artists."
1,70's rock rehash,"This is the worst album I've heard in a long time. Egotistical, self centered lyrics,( he compares himself with Hank Williams and Elvis?)sung to a rehash of old 70's style rock. I'm surprised this stuff still sells. If ""Things Change"", it isn't evident here."
2,Set This CD Down,"Say it ain't so-Track 1- The cowboy in me attributes every questionable quality in the singer to ""The Cowboy In Me"" - what a wonderful depiction of the cowboy.Maybe I got off on the wrong foot with this album, but too many of the songs have the same overproduced shiny sound as his last album. There are exceptions, though, ""Angry All The Time"" is an amazing song to begin with, and Tim and Faith's versions is as strong, or stronger than Bruce Robison & Kelly Willis's. Telluride, takes Tim's heartbreak to the ski slopes and has some great lines, and it an original take on an old country theme. Forget about us, written by Mark Collie, is another tune worth a listen, simple and sad and wonderful. Other than that, Angel Boy's vocal doesn't fit the mood of the song. Smilin' is Where the Green Grass Grows with a alternate lyric. Needs less pop arrangements, and more country ones. Tim McGraw was one of my favorite country artists. Things Change."
1,"If I could rate it a zero, I would","I used to be such a big Tim fan. I have most of his cds, but then I bought 'Set this Circus Down'. I would say its one of the worst cds in my collection! Listen to every song on the cd. It sounds like he's whining about his love life in just about every song. Yeah, we know you love Faith but do you have to keep shoving it down the fans throats? I only like two songs on the whole cd. Tim's best was 'A Place in the Sun'. Circus has to be the worst cd he's released. The day he got married was the day the music went out the window.I doubt I'll buy another Tim cd. His next work will probably just be more whining. The same with the next and then the next. It's a cycle of crap now. Save your money."
2,Boo Hoo,"This guy sings all over the radio that he doesn't know why they say grown men don't cry. Because they don't. Stop being such a wimp!He has a good-looking wife, though. Buy her stuff instead."
2,This CIRCUS needs HELP!!,"I am still shaking my head after waiting so long for this new album by Tim McGraw. I am a huge fan of his but after this latest release, I may not pick up his next and wait for his next Greatest Hits Volume 2 if and when it ever comes out...this new cd has some good tracks....TELLURIDE, THINGS CHANGE, ANGEL BOY, ANGRY ALL THE TIME, and WHY WE SAID GOODBYE. The rest is just ok....maybe it will grow on me....but buyers be aware and listen to it first before purchasing online or at a record store!"
1,"Corporate Nashville, please explain","Tim McGraw can't sing, let's start with that. Toneless and unemotional, his success is a complete mystery to me.Then there are the songs...""Angry All The Time"" is a woman's song, obviously. The story is, it was meant for Faith, but she was pregnant and wouldn't be able to tour and promote the song, so Tim cut it. Great rationale, huh?""The Cowboy In Me""....does he have something against cowboys? Those are insulting lyrics, I hope he knows.Essentially, I think Tim McGraw lacks both native talent and basic judgment. Of his numerous megahits, I can count on three fingers the ones I actually enjoy. This does not square, proportionally, with his success. There must be some powerful corporate mechanics at work giving him the career he has somehow obtained.If I could give a share of his success to more deserving performers, I would choose Collin Raye and John Michael Montgomery, both of whom have all the goods."
2,Set This Circus Down on less than solid ground,"Tim McGraw's latest effort seems to lack the musical and lyrical creativity from his previous two CDs. Although his interpretation of each song is as inviting as those found on ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Everywhere"", somehow the selection of songs seems ho-hum in terms of what we know Tim is capable of expressing. As a result, the majority of songs sound flat, and lifeless despite Tim pouring his heart and soul with each breath. ""Set This Circus Down"" falls far short of the heights both ""Sun"" and ""Everywhere"" have been."
5,Tim does it again,"I have listened to Tim McGraw for about three years now and he just keeps getting better. I didn't think anything could measure up to his last two releases ""Everywhere"" and ""A Place in the Sun."" But ""Set This Circus Down"" delivers. Each song is great. You won't be hitting the forward button at all. ""Let Me Love You"" is a different style from the rest and it works wonderfully. ""Angry All The Time"" is surely going to be another Number 1 hit. If you like Tim McGraw, run, don't walk to get his latest release. You won't be disappointed."
5,Worth The Wait,"Set This Circus down is Tim McGraw's sixth studio album, and arguably his best yet. On this new collection of songs, Tim has created one of the best sounding country albums to come out in a while. His ability to choose hit songs is amazing, every song on this album could be released to country radio, and be a success. When he records the albums though he isnt even thinking of what country will play and what they wont, he makes the music he wants to make, which just proves what a great career he has. Tim has proven with this new album that he has longevity in his career. Highlights include the honest The Cowboy In Me, You Get Used To Somebody, the soul bearing Take Me Away From Here, the ballad of a broken marriage Angry All The Time (with Faith Hill on background vocals), and much more. Go out and get a copy, you wont regret it!"
5,Vibrates The Soul,"You'll find all sorts of music in my collection, mostly trending toward great blues artists, like SRV and John Cleary. I love variety and hardly ever listen to the same CD twice in the same week. But ""Set This Circus Down"" is getting a lot of airtime in my house these days! I find myself playing it over and over again! Tim's voice -- all the way down to the way he pronounces specific words -- is just solid and unique. The voice of a story teller. The lyrics are magical and memorable and make sense. Finally, the music is really enjoyable and he takes some chances -- you hear some blues, some eagles steel guitar, some flamenco -- sprinkled throughout. All in all, it's a soaring collection and really lifts the spirit. Highly recommended."
5,Keeps getting better,"This is by far the best of Tim McGraw. He is getting better and better all the time (lucky Faith). If you happen to read a bad review on this cd - don't believe it. Buy it, listen to it over and over again. Thanks Tim."
5,A truly well-made album,"Set This Circus Down is definately my favorite album. It is one of the few albums that when you listen to it, you love every single song. I once heard Tim McGraw say that he wasn't satisfied with his singing, and that he wanted to improve. Well, improve he did! I think he has not only improved his singing, he has nearly perfected it. And the instrumentation is of the best quality. Though I'm only eighteen and don't know very much about music, I think this album is magnificent. I have heard it about five hundred thousand times since I received it for Christmas."
4,Tim did it again.,My wife actually bought it Fridaynight and she refused to let melisten to it till she was through.She loved it. I finally heard it today and it is another big hit.I don't know why grown men don'tcry was my favorite.I can relateto it because I Brian Elaine lostmy dad and it made me cry.Thereis so many things I wanna say tohim.No wonder Faith Hill loves him to.He is talented and a nice guy.I recommend this with all my heart.It is truly nice work.4 stars forthis.
2,Wow!,"As a Texan who has achieved a still-unbelieveable level of success through a combination of lofty financial contributions, misadventure, and gross social blunders by immensely gifted contemporaries, McGraw has baffled industry nay-sayers by racking up CD sales in the millions. He does this through his deft song choices, and here Bruce Robison's wonderful ""Angry All The Time"" bolsters this effort and makes it almost listenable."
5,"Love it, Love Tim","I like the album very much. If people like Tim McGraw and his previous albums they will certainly like this album. Someone made the comment that Tim does not play the guitar well, and that he does not write his own music... So what?? Lots of artists don't play any instruments nor write their own music. I listen to the words and how well the singer sings, and that is how I judge the albums I buy. I highly recommend ""Set this Circus Down""."
4,Set This Circus Down---In my head....,"As a fan of Tim McGraw since 1993, I have always kept up with his newest albums. I thought after ""A Place in the Sun"" debued no other album could top it. But I stood corrected with this CD! Tim is a great example of how life goes on and only gets better. His voice is carried with me throughout the day because I cannot get his songs out...but there is no complaint there!"
3,Inconsistent,"This is like 2 albums; there are 5-6 really good songs on it, and the rest is mediocre to terrible. For the hard-core country fans, The Cowboy in Me and Angry all the Time represents the best of a long tradition of self-hate through music. The songs Set This Circus Down, Grown Men Don't Cry, and Unbroken are good cross-over with light country elements (not a lot of steel guitar in the entire album, for that matter).But the rest of the album is terrible; I really think Things Change is one of the worst songs I've heard in a long time. Unless you are a hard-core McGraw fan your best bet is to just get a Greatest Hits album that includes the good songs and eliminates the fluff."
1,Where's the country Tim?,"I am a huge fan of Tim McGraw. He is very talented and sexy, but he needs to get back to his country sounding albums. The albums ""Not a moment too soon,"" ""All I want,"" and ""everywhere"" blew me away with the talent this man has. ""A place in the sun"" was ok, but this latest effort is so horrible that I traded it in at a used cd store. I couldn't believe how different his music style sounded. Except for ""the cowboy in me,"" all the songs [bad] and sound like ""filler"" material! I feel guilty saying this because Tim is so cool, but it's the truth about this album."
5,Songs with a point,"I have listened to the CD 3 times in the first day, and it amazes me how closley you need to listen to the words. Every song seems to have meaning, and Tim Makes you feel every song. ""Angry All the Time"" makes you think about the struggles of a man with the changes of a woman. ""Things Change"" give hope to everyone issues that pop up from time to time. More ballads, but there are some more upbeat songs as well. What you would expect from Tim McGraw CD. It seems like a very personal CD for Tim."
3,good book - but not great,"This was a pretty good book, although it gets a bit repetitive. It's definately not a GREAT book, and not worth the price. I would pay about $15 for this book at the most."
5,BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!!!,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD EVER!!!! If you don't have this CD, your life is not complete! Savage Garden is without a doubt the greatest band that has ever walked this earth! I love their music! I COMPLETELY recomend their album!!!!!!!!"
4,Simple easy-to -play adventure,"It could be counted as the first adventure module (excluded 3D Tiles modules in 1980s) which apply new ""easy to play"" format with map sheet & stand-up figure. This format was later adopted by D&D modules setting in Thunder Rift. On the other hand, the module is the last published D&D adventure module setting in Mystara.It is quite easy for novice DMs to handle. Though the story is simple, it is good written. It is best to run as a sequel to DDA3. If run as stand alone adventure, it should not be the first adventure since monsters here may be too strong for a party which all members are Level One!"
2,NOT for the undergraduate,"The language experts give this book a good rating, but I, the undergraduate, see little value in this book. The author's native tongue doesnot seem to be english. The book focuses on things like why ""their"" is an execption to the rule ""i before e except after c"". This book is far from simple to understand."
4,"Still standard, but no longer the last word.","Even recently published English-language grammars of Biblical Hebrew admit that Gesenius-Kautsch-Cowley (GKC) is still good for people like me who can't (yet) read German.As you read the Hebrew Bible and find grammatical challanges, look first in Jouon-Muraoka, Williams and Waltke-O'Connor . If they don't answer your question, look in GKC. If GKC doesn't answer it, look in commentaries.The binding of GKC is beautiful and durable."
2,Beware which edition/copy you buy!!!!,"Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar is the ""industry standard"" for Hebrew Grammars. However, when I ordered the book new, directly from Amazon, the copy that came was, in itself, useless. The publisher's note says that it was a book that was reprinted using optical character recognition software and that the typos have NOT been fixed, because it would cost them too much to do that. There are way too many typos in this copy (put out by ""General Books"" or ""RareBooksClub.com"") for it to be useable in my college/seminary/parish studies. Nor is there any index or such system in the copy I received. If I were you, I'd make sure it's a copy published by Dover (Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (Dover Language Guides)) because I know that copy is reliable and has a good index, it's what my classmates use. Don't do what I did: I ordered new, directly from Amazon, and that version was the bad one. Hopefully I can help out some fellow biblical scholars with this review!"
5,The Traditional Excellence of a Scholarly Work,"They say that Gesenius could fill a lecture hall with people who just wanted to hear him talk about Hebrew grammar. Today, even in light of most modern works and scholarship, this grammar is a standard and the most widely used reference grammar on the market. It does have one flaw, the list of reference passages from the Old Testament is incomplete and a better listing has been produced with some other publications. Still, for the price, this is a solid product worth owning."
4,Standard Reference Grammar for BH in English,"Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar is the standard reference grammar in English for Biblical Hebrew. Anyone serious about reading and translating Hebrew Bible will need a copy on their shelf for reference, when things get difficult. The book is well indexed, so navigation is not too difficult. There is also a scriptural index, so finding entries that directly relate to a passage that you are working on may be found. The verbal paradigms are in the back of the book. They are complete. Given the age of the text, the language used to describe grammatical and syntactic features may be unfamiliar to people trained in modern linguistics.All this said, I like Waltke and O'Connors' Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax better. I frequently end up consulting multiple sources when really stuck, so it pays to have both."
4,"Good Price, but not Most Recent Edition","Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar remains as one of the standard grammars for Biblical Hebrew studies. This paperback edition is a very affordable alternative to the expensive hardcover edition. Especially suitable for starving graduate students such as myself! However, it should be noted that the Dover paperback edition was apparently not printed from the most recent hardcover edition & therefore doesn't have the updated indices that the newer edition has, which may explain why it is so cheap. Otherwise it appears to be identicle to the hardcover."
2,Poor edition of a great book,I recently bought Oxford's hardcover edition and its a damn shame that for the price of the book what you get is a glued photocopy of the original edition. I won't get into the content of the book. Gesenius' work is legendary for those interested in the subject. But I do warn those interested in this edition of what they'll get. It is sad that such a fine publishing house as OUP is getting into the habit of selling expensive editions of books that basically amount to a cheap reprint of the original. Instead of advertising it as expensive hardcover editions they should be more frank about what they are really delivering.
3,Works well... for two weeks,I've had this camera for about 4 months now... It worked great at the beginning... but the speaker stoped working after two weeks (at the moment I thougth it was no problem as long as everything else kept working fine...but it didn't) Now the LCD display has also stoped working and the camera is virtually useless that way 'cause you need the display to access all the camera's functions. I tried contacting Aiptek via email but I've had no reply to any of my emails... awful customer service.Now I can only use it as a web cam (which by the way makes your image go greenish sometimes) but I guess that for that use you can get a less expensive and better working web camera. I would recomend you invest a hundred dollars more and get a real digital camera.
4,Neat little camera,"It's a neat little camera. It can do a lot of things to be only $100. I love it. It could include a memory chip and a flash. But for only a $100, I can forgive these absentses. It's good to have around for everyday recordings, but not on an everday basis. Quality is good, the sound is good, and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this little camera."
3,Cute and Compact,"I recently purchased the Aiptek Pocket DV2 Digital Camera.I agree that you should take the pics outside as there isn't a flash to use indoors and the pics turn out dark and grainy. But really, you get what you pay for and when your shelling out less than $100 for a digital camera/camcorder, don't expect a whole lot from it. Other than that, it was a perfect gift to give my teenage daughter, because in case she ever loses it or breaks it, I'm not going to lose my mind over the expense."
5,The Best,"This camera/camcorder is incredible. You'll think because it only $80 it's cheap and it will only last for a little while but trust me you're getting your monies worth. It's amazing how when you show things on the tv that have been recorded it shows up clear as can be. If you buy this item you will not regret it, it's for a good price too you better take advantage"
3,ok,this camera does not work unless you have full light.(my best friend has this camera) But it doesnt take a rocket scientist to turn on a light. its wonderful outside. the sound is only a little fuzzy but great. The picture is wonderful. I would suggest this for teenagers who just want to get memories of them and their friends. Its super fun to play w/ and for the price its great. The only down side is that you only get to record like 3 minutes but if you want to record more like 15 or 20 minutes you have to buy a card for like 80 bucks. but i like it i might buy it with my christmas money. Another thing is its really easy to work w/ few buttons its great and you can put pictures and videos onto the computer. I LOVE IT!!
5,sweet mini cam,This camcorder is a great 3 in 1 deal and gives great quality. This camcorder also gives great sound recordings. You can take the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen. You may need to get a cf camcorder card but otherwise this is the greatest camcorder ever made in a small package in a great deal.
1,Don't buy it!,"I don't know if I got a lemon or not, but this camera has been a piece of junk from the beginning. I purchased extra storage card to use with it. The camera worked once with the storage card. I tried to get help from the Aiptek customer service. BIG JOKE! Don't waste money on this one!"
2,not the best,This camera is very handy and small but the memory is horrible. The camcorder only holds two minutes of recorded data. Without the CF card (comes separatly) the memory on the camera is the worst. It only holds about three pictures before the memory is full and the battery dies down a day of use. Horrible!
2,Be Aware,"I bought this camera on March 4 and when I went to turn it on May 1st, the LCD Screen wouldn't work. This camera may work well when you first get it, but don't expect it to last for long.BE AWARE!!!"
1,Junk! Don't buy!,"I bought this camera because I wanted something inexpensive, and it seemed to have pretty good resolution for the price. Wrong! Even the smallest photos turned out blurry because of the poor lens. Spend a little more money and get something useable."
5,best camera ever,this is the best camera ever.i have had it for a year and it still works. if you bought tis camera it would be the best deal ever. i took this camera averwhere i took it to the outter banx 5 times and it still works. i got sand in it at the beach and it still works. if yo do not buy this camera you will miss out on a lot. this camera is pocket size and can go anywhere. if i could i would give it 12 stars out of 5.this camera is the size of my palm of my hand.it is very easy to pack. and if you dont have a lot of money this is a good cheap camera.
4,It is a great product but...,"It is a great product but I don't like the fact that you have to buy a memory pack in order for you to get a longer amount of time on the video. I think that if you want to sell this camcorder you should in the least bit include a &quot;32mb CF Card&quot;.To be honest I love the pocket sized camcorder and I am glad that my mother was able to affored it and give it to me for christmas, but it really does hurt that all my life I've wanted a camcorder and when I finally get one I have to spend more than half as much on a memory card then on the camcorder.this is all I have to say about this product."
5,Excellent one volume account of a long war,"Weller's book is a genuine classic of military history, describing a long war in a clear, incisive narrative. The battles are described concisely while pointing out options, mistakes, and tactical aspects. But it is a book of more than just battle accounts. Weller also intelligently explores the strategic problems and opportunities faced by both sides during the Peninuslar War. Certainly Wellington is Weller's hero in this narrative, but he me makes a compelling case for why the man who would become known as the Iron Duke deserves his sterling reputation."
5,"Jac Weller, Great Military Historian.","This is the best short history of the ""Peninsula War"" ever written. The analysis of the battles is concise, yet enjoyable reading. Weller was a great story teller as well as a great military historian."
1,Just to bad!,"Don't even think about bying ths book. Sure it got some nice pictures, but the rest of the book stinks. Same your money and buy one of the many other good books in Amazon."
2,Never felt the characters,"After inital interest in this book, I had to force myself to finish it. I never really felt anything for the characters. The developement was so shallow, it was hard to really get to know them. While Simon and Annie claimed to have a ""love"" relationship, I never felt the love. I would not reccomend this book."
1,A true disappointment,"A friend of mine recommended Danielle Steel when we were at the library, and I have to say that after reading this book I was thoroughly disappointed. I expected an author of Steel's popularity to be able to write with far more sophistication than I found in this book. I was actually somewhat annoyed with this book, considering that practically every fact is repeated several times. Steel could have written the same predictable story in 100 pages and still have retained the entire plot. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a good romance novel."
2,More of the same,"I have read almost EVERY DS novel and I love her but this book is boring and the character is dull. And the word that kept poping in my head while I read this book was... Wings. Same story, same historical period, different gender. What a disappointment."
1,"Typical, predictable BORING DS","Once again, Danielle Steele cranks out a boring, predictible book about a rich, young girl and an older man and their stupid choices and foolish mistakes (and they were supposedly such smart, worldly people) until they come together again and almost live happily ever after. I could barely get through the first couple of chapters. Then I just skimmed the remainer and realized same story, different names. Save your money and borrow it from the library!! I will never again waste my money on Danielle Steel!! I would have gave this book zero stars if I could!!"
1,Don't waste your money with this one,"This is the worst novel I have ever read by Danielle Steel. If you enjoy spineless female characters and emotionally abusive, childish men then you may like this story. I only kept reading because I was hoping it would get better; unfortunately, it only got worse. I didn't even finish the last chapter. I skimmed it, hoping (in vain) that Kate would come to her senses. Instead, she continues to pine after a man who has admitted over and over again that she will never come first in his life. I have no idea what Danielle Steel was thinking with this one. I think I'll stick to her earlier works and toss this one in the trash."
4,it was not as bad as others say!,"I dont know whats wrong with all the other people that read this book but i really enjoyed it. Yes, threw out the book it kind of gets on your nerves that Joe can't commit. But I think that DS made it clear that he really wasnt that bad of a guy! he didnt intentionaly try to keep hurting Kate. If any of you out their have ever exsperienced a love in your life that you simply couldnt get away from, no matter how hard you tried. You will appriciate this book for what it really is and love it the way i did."
2,Very disappointing,"I have read every Danielle Steel book and own most of them. This can't be written by Danielle Steel. This book is slow, with very dull spoiled characters. I couldn't stand the ""hero"". He was childish, selfish and cowardly. I hated the beginning. I hated the end. I hated the middle. I think Danielle Steel needs a long vacation. Don't bother with this book."
3,"Just so, so","I, too, have read every one of her books. This was clearly a ""you need to get another book published for your fans now"" and it didn't really have the thought and research of so many of her other ones. It seemed that this one came from the research done on Silent Honor, which was one of her best books. Sorry, but I'm not even sure that she actually wrote Lone Eagle. A little of her style but not the real ""Steel"" mix and feel. It must being getting hard after 50plus books. If you're a fan, you'll still read it as I did."
2,"Kate, please get it in your head he's no good for you","I was very disappointed in this book. I thought that Kate finally got over Joe when she married that other guy who really loved her. Then Joe came back into her life and filled her full of lies so she divoriced her husband. Joe's character made me hate him. I kept hoping that Kate would finally leave him. I wanted to toss the book, but I had to see if Kate would leave him. I don't think anyone should put up with such abuse from a man. He didn't wan't her baby, he never wanted to be home, he really never wanted Kate. Joe just used her through out the book."
1,Forget It,"This is the most trite, insipid book I have ever read. The characters were so incredibly shallow that by the time I got 3/4 of the way through I quit. I knew Joe died from the very beginning, so why waste my time reading the rest of it."
2,Repetitive & wishy-washy,"At first, I thought I was crazy when I couldn't get into this book, but found that others felt similarly. I couldn't get into it! Danielle Steele described the characters' feelings with the same words & emotions throughout the entire novel! All it seemed like was that Kate aged biologically, but not emotionally. At one point in the story, I was getting really annoyed at her for sounding like a nagging wife (though her concerns seemed semi-legit). Don't we have enough ""nagging wives"" across America? I really couldn't like Joe the way I could ""like"" other characters from Ms. Steele's other novels, probably because he admitted first and foremost that airplanes were his first true love. Yes, there are many men like that out there, but Danielle Steele novels are supposed to be an escape - and aren't supposed to be thinly veiled portrait of some man we all knew..."
3,"same old, same old","This is one of those stories where you just can't take it anymore! Danielle Steel has the tendency to repeat little things in her stories, but in here, she overdoes it, and it became a headache for me -- took me two weeks just to read. Anyway, I gave it three stories because the story itself was excellent -- yes, I know she's formulaic, but I like her stories. I hope THE KISS will be like JOURNEY or LEAP OF FAITH."
4,Lone Eagle,It was an intriguing book to read kept me turning the pages. As always Danielle writes excellent books. This one in particular was one that didn't have the outcome I expected but it was an enjoyable book much like a roller coaster you never knew what to expect. Once you thought you had the book figured out the characters take totally different turns.
1,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed in this book. I have read all of danielle steel's books. I feel like she is just cranking out the books.The ending was blah... I could of cared less what happened to these two characters. She protrayed the main character as a whinny woman who has nothing to do but wait around for her man to come home to her.. A normal women would tell this man to take a hike a long time ago.. This isn't true love it is co-dependancy. I'm also sick of women who easily fall into bed because the man shows up on the doorstep saying ""honey i'm home""..."
2,Can't believe it was Steel,"I read some of the other reviews and I have to agree with the ones who believe that someone else wrote this for her. I have read most all her works and this one is at the bottom. Not only does the prologue tell you ending before you get started, but the book could have been written in a 100 pages if she wouldn't have repeated herself over and over and over.If she did, in fact, write this, then I suggest she takes more time and writes one great book every six months or year instead of trying to have her own book-of-the-month club."
2,Steel not up to par on this one.,"Although the story line is good, the writing is repetitive. The reader is constantly reminded of what he/or she has already read. It's also dragged out and is a long book as it is. I have read a lot of her books through the years and this one disappoints. Each time this star-crossed couple gets a set back in this book, it starts over again... the best thing about it was the ending when it finally came - and that was anti-climatic. One wonders if Steel actually did the writing.I have outgrown Ms. Steel, I do believe, as I have been reading a few authors lately that really grab your attention and don't let go, that is what I like. I would not recommend this to someone that wants more substance in their reading."
2,Read another DS book,"There are too many Danielle Steel books to read, don't bother with this one. It was was good but you will hate the male main character, Joe. Joe is the most selfish, arrogant man. You pray that Kate gives him the boot. If only she did then we'd get to watch Joe cry over losing her once again. He wants her, he doesn't want her. Then she moves on and is fine and he doesn't like that so he wants her again. Unfortunately, she keeps taking him back. This book only proves your mother is usually right (as much as daughters hate to admit it) They usually know what is best for us but it's not clear to us until later."
4,Not your typical...,"...love story ingredients.I find it funny that people either loved or hated the style of this book. I've been on a Danielle Steele kick this summer and this is one of my latest reads.I loved that fact that it was a story you couldn't get enough of and were just dying to find out if Kate & Joe would end up together in true love or not. I have to agree that there were many many MANY break-ups & make-ups but - you know... that made it more realistic.Perhaps we DON'T want as much 'real'ness to our love stories... Perhaps we just want a fairy tale ending that we ourselves don't have or don't feel we'll ever find (me?~ yes, me *sigh*).I do think it was a beautiful story. I couldn't put it down - even in a country auction I went to with my grandparents. (The auctioneer must have thought I was nutty! haha) It brought tears to my eyes twice. Now THAT doesn't happen very often.It's easy to get into and very worth the read. Read it.. you'll know what we mean. =0)"
1,"I, too, miss the old DS","I have loved Steel's books for many years. Her stories and characters have always been very real and her descriptions of places were outstanding. Her last few books have been a disappointment, as the stories have become less and less interesting. I have always tried to ignore her annoying writing habits (And she did this. And they did that......). In this book the bad writing is just made worse by constant repetition. I thought if Kate ran her lovely long fingers through her dark shoulder length red hair one more time I would scream."
2,Not Recommended for Lovers of Love,"I enjoyed this book until just before I was half-way through. The love connection is amazing, the behavior is bad. If you like conflict, you'll like this book. As a woman who works very hard at being married and getting your man to commit... this book infuriated me to no end. I love the way she writes, but she is duplicitous and negative. She portrays a troubled relationship as a good one. It is a contradiction of true love."
2,if you read one you read them all,"I love Danielle Steel but this book is becoming boring. It may be because I read Wings a few weeks ago, if you have read one romance/airplane/wwII book you read them all I guess. It's similiar in that she's younger he's older and he has misgivings about the age difference just like in Wings. I hope it picks up soon or it may be a no finisher."
3,Typical danielle steel story !!,"I am a regular DS reader and I have always appreciated her insight into human beings and their relationships. This book is no exception. Though highly improbable (but hey its a romance !)it does make a good read. But somehow i was disappointed with the hero who i felt did not realise the value of kate almost till the very end. Though i agree with her notion of letting go of something you love, it also goes without saying that love and marriage do change you in many radical ways, and for a marriage to work both must be willing to change, which does not seem to be the case here. And contrary to all beliefs, marriage does require time spent together. The heroine was a disappointment in the sense that she does not really know her own mind and ends up hurting Andy in the process. The story also reminded me of her earlier novel wings, but i liked wings a lot better."
4,Classic Danielle Steel!!,"The characters were so ""real""...they lingered with me for days after I completed this book. Danielle Steel fans will not be disappointed."
1,very disapointed by Lone Eagle,"Do not waste your money on this book. I am usually a big reader of her books but this one was slow,boring and the guy for his age needed to grow up . There is no good part in this book sorry to say. I hope her next book is better. Maybe she needs to take a long rest between writing her books. I'm glad my sister lent me this book."
2,Danielle is slipping,"I've noticed in the past 2 years that Danielle Steel's books are slipping. It's taking me forever to continue reading this book. I find myself putting it down. That never happened in the 1980's and 90's. Her books were gold. My husband used to joke that I would get one of her books and pretty much finish it in 1 day, 2 the most. Now her books are not written as well as they used to be. I think the last good book I read of hers was The Wedding and Bittersweet. I have continued to buy her books (up to date) hoping they would be like they were in the past, but they're not. I don't know why her writing has changed or maybe she's putting too many books out too fast.I miss the old Danielle Steel writing."
1,OVER AND OVER AND OVER,"How can she say the same thing over and over, and still get us to read her books?? She needs to go back to writing school and learn about plot development. When she gives the whole story away in the first chapter, who cares what else happens? And character development, she tells us about them, but doesn't develop them any further. I used to like D.S. but I think I'm about to give up on her!!"
1,IS THIS WHAT WOMEN DREAM ABOUT?,"I was really disappointed in this novel by one of the best-selling writers of our time. I kept waiting for the characters to grow and get some depth. The woman, Kate, was a seventeen year old bright shining star when the story began. I kept waiting for her to get a grip and get rid of Joe, who was a selfish self-centered baby who wouldn't commit (and god forbid he get some help for that!) For example, on page 380 it was STILL HER FAULT. ""She thought constantly about what had happened to them, trying to understand her part in it...and in time she could see how her reaching out and wanting more time with him had panicked him."" YUK! Kate's life was really depressing, waiting for Joe to come home and throw her a bone once in a while. It wasn't another woman, but his obsession with his airplanes. I had hoped that the book would have Kate making some healthy choices. She showed such promise at the beginning..."
1,Fly Away Already!,I read romance novels for fun and escape not for a great literary experience. This novel is one of Danielle Steel's worst. The writing is so basic that at times it sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. There is absolutly no depth to these characters. At the begining of this novel you really want these two to be together but by the end I found Joe very dislikable and wished he'd just leave Kate alone. How many times can you be burned before you learn not to touch fire? Most of this novel takes place during the first 15-20 years of their relationship and then all of a sudden at the end of a page Ms. Steel skips ahead 17 years??? We totally are ripped off of the supposed happy ending. However I don't think I could have stood another chapter of this book but maybe I would have liked Joe more. Read at your own risk.
1,Slow and Boring!,I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and this by far is her worst. The last 5 or so have not been up to her scale as when she first started doing novels..How disappointing it is not to like her book. Danielle go back and read your first few novels and take some lessons. I will not purchase anymore of her books.
1,Big Waste of Time,"After finishing two recent releases by LuAnne Rice and Kristen Hannah I have decided after reading Lone Eagle that I will never waste another moment of my time reading another Danielle Steel novel again. The characters in this book were the most unlikeable duo I have ever encountered in a story line. By the time this book finally ended I couldn't believe Danielle Steel can continue to embarass herself with these ridiculous novels. Your time would be better spent reading a book with ""real"" characters and interesting storylines."
5,Busy Ball Choo-Choo,Our one year old loved this train. One of her favorite toys. It does not work well on carpet however when in the travel mode.
3,Doesn't roll well on carpet,"We bought this over the past weekend for our 9 month old. He loves watching the balls roll around and then takes them out to play with them. He figured out right away how to push the button on top and make it go. The one problem is that it doesn't roll very well on the carpeting where he plays. It starts and then stops and then we have to push it a little to get it to start again. So, not so great. He doesn't crawl yet and we were hoping this would encourage him but it's not!"
3,"Good, but....","Just be prepared to lose a ball or two. We lost a ball the first day, and I still can't find it. They are the perfect size that will roll under couches, tables, etc. I am a freak about keeping toy parts together so that part bugs me. However, my one year old daughter seems to like this toy. Not her favorite, but she does like putting the balls in it, and taking them out when they spin around. Keeps her entertained for around 10 minutes at a time. I think soon she will enjoy it more when she is more motivated to chase after it across the kitchen floor!"
5,Fun toy for toddler,I got this as a Christmas present for my 21 month old and he LOVES it!! It is very durable and can be played with in stationary mode or make it move in circles or in a line. The music is pleasant and not too loud. I highly recommend this for toddlers!
3,A bit shallow.,"I was looking forward to this book, but was disapointed. Over all, I found it to be shallow in its history in most places, and pretty narrow as well."
3,Works for me,"I ordered these for transcontinental, transoceanic extra long flight, but they did not arrive until after I returned. It also took a couple of attempts to get an email response from the vendor. I had to rush out the night before my flight to a distant town to pick up something that could help prevent deep vein thrombosis.What I like most about the product is that they are thigh-high AND compression. They are kinda pretty, too. I don't like waist high compression products, as they make me very uncomfortable on long flights.So -- I haven't worn them yet and have no comment on the product, but the supplier was somewhat marginal. They did deliver, but about 2-3 weeks late.UPDATE >> I have used these on trans-oceanic flight now and they are great for this purpose. Defeat deep vein thrombosis! Practice prevention. Check these out, ladies."
1,THEATRE OF BOREDOM! A VERY DISAPPOINTING LEE FILM! 1 1/2 STARS!,"I love horror films and can be very forgiving, but 'Theatre Of Death' is one that doesn't really have many good points. It's slow moving with little action and the dialogue is boring. I found this film on a double feature DVD with 'Circus Of Horrors', which thankfully is a far superior film and made the purchase worth while. I'm sure some Lee fans will watch anything he makes, but this is one of his most disappointing films I've ever seen. On the plus side on the double feature it has a short feature-ette with Mr. Lee, some trailers and a stills gallery. If your a fan of the film the transfer looks very good and enough effort in the extras to make if worth your purchase."
4,Goody goody!,"The first thing you should know, is that this is more of a murder mystery than a horror movie. It's definitely not a bad one, but definitely not scary. There seems to be some confusion, as if two separate scripts were filmed or one swapped for an other during the filming, but the result is quite good. There are some really beautiful actors / actresses, good score (if my memory serves me properly, by a female composer) and a nice dark overall mood. The backstage feeling is quite realistic as well and presents a good picture of what the life of an avant-garde theatre personality must have looked like in the sixties. And more important, the sound / picture quality (wide screen) of this DVD (Momentum / Kino, with a mustard-toned cover) is so good it is really difficult to explain to the non initiated viewer that this movie is 35 years old...."
1,Not Good at All,This had to be one of the worst films Christopher Lee has ever done. It was not scary. The movie was predictible. The plot is horrible and the ending is as dull as it gets. Please do not waste your time on this horrible film.
4,Pretty solid so far,"For about 2 years I've owned a wallet with a money clip on the inside and loved it. The money is easily accessible, while at the same time being safely enclosed in leather. After searching several stores and not finding any available, I was lucky enough to stumble on this one at Amazon.I haven't owned the product for very long, so I can't speak for it's durability, but I do like the layout. Not having a large pocket means your wallet is not likely to accrue receipts you don't really care about. That said, this wallet is definitely tight. You have six credit card pockets, but they appear to be designed for one card each - they're very slim. This wallet could cause you to make some choices about what you really want to carry around with you, because it's not roomy (which may be a good thing)."
4,Dependable Gumbo in the Big Easy,"Disclaimer: Owner of all 72 official PJ bootlegs. This is an above-average performance in the Big Easy, and is a dependable entry from the early section of the American tour. A very emotional rendition of ""Long Road"" opens the show, which then continues into an especially rocking set list, which is lower on ballads than usual. Included among the rockers this evening are some relative tour rarities like ""Evacuation,"" ""In Hiding"" and ""Jeremy,"" not to mention the first of only two appearances of the cover ""Sonic Reducer"" by punk band the Dead Boys. The band is in a very jam-worthy mood tonight. All of the extra-long barnburners (""Daughter,"" ""Rearviewmirror,"" and ""Porch"") are top-of-the-line, with Matt Cameron holding down the fort especially well while the rest of the band is off jamming. In this evening's stage banter, watch for Eddie Vedder's hysterical description of the political conventions taking place that week (""My fellow Americans..."")."

2,Corn Squirrel Log,"My squirrels wouldn't even touch this item. After sitting on the feeder for two weeks, I finally took it off, broke it up into pieces and put it on the ground. I thought the birds might like it or the squirrels might pick the pieces up off of the ground, but they didn't. Not even the pigeons would eat it. I left the pieces on the ground another week thinking maybe the Racoons were hungry enough to eat it. NO LUCK!"
1,Nope!,"Squirrels don't touch it. If you are buying food, then I suggest you stick with corn...the real stuff and you will have success."
1,Do not order from them,"I have ordered from them before and was very happy. So this time I ordered more and I am so sorry. I opened the box and to my horror the product was brown! It is to be a corn color of yellow. It is from ground corn. Tryed to call, on hold for 15 minutes then got a person that had no idea what I was talking about. He wanted me to ship it back! The shipping was well over 25.00. Each weights 32oz and I have 20! His computer was down and he could call me back in 30 minutes. Never happened. I am just sick over this. I don't dare put this out for my birds and squirrels to eat. Don't know if safe. Out now over 150.00 dollars. Please learn from my mistake!"
5,Great for rabbits too!,"We put these out for the squirrels so they don't get all wigged out over our other seed, but we've seen rabbits totally get into these logs. We even watched one get up on its hinds and give a small squirrel a whap across the body. Pretty cool seeing nature attack one another."
1,bad choice,this product gets paws down from my squirrel's. They wont touch it and not even a nibble. This product sucks .. at least according to my neighborhood squirrel's.
1,Squirrelog,"I've ordered this product numerous time, but the last time I ordered it they smelled rotten The squirrels wouldn't even eat it."
2,Saddened they didn't like it!,"The Squirrelog just didn't work! The squirrels just didn't like it. It stayed on the feeders for a few weeks and at a closer look I noticed it had mold on it. They never touched it. I actually knocked them off the feeders and threw them near the edge of the woods.........squirrels still didn't even touch them. They still enjoy the fresh corn we provide, but I was really hoping for the product to be a success :-("
3,Obsession,"A squirrel found the new log and is now obsessed with it. It is guarding this golden treasure, as well as sleeping under it. The squirrel has eaten half of it in the last week. Is there any danger of the squirrel getting sick?"
5,Squirrel food,If you have bird feeders and squirrels like to come and raid them this product will keep them busy at their own feeding spot. The corn logs last much longer than the usual corn cobs and only squirrels have the teeth to really make a dent in the logs.
2,Dissappointed Saul Fan,"I have to agree with the previous review in that, I wonder how Saul's mind can go here and write, so realistically about this wacko who abducts teenage girls. It's weird to me. I have read just about all of his books and he has been my favorite author, but, I have to tell you that there have been a couple of books, including this one, where I constantly wonder how anyone can come up with this stuff. It's a bit disturbing. His older stuff is great. The newer stuff, I would stay away from. Very dark."
2,Formulaic plot.....simplistic writing....very shallow overall,"This book is a major letdown, like his last novel. The plot and writing are shallow and simplistic; there's no depth here like in a good Koontz or King book. Good thing I checked it out from the library instead of paying for this junk."
1,Not worth it.,"Saul has always been a dark writer, and I've enjoyed many of his books (Shadows, God Project, Creature)This one turned my stomach when I read several portions. And when it didn't, it was just plain boring. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Not JS's best,"Sometimes the plot is good, sometimes is boring and sometimes is almost unreadable. The main story is very good but the abductor's plans are just a waste of time. Whatever he say could be said in one or two paragraphs not three or four pages. The worst of it is the end. It was just a fairy tale and not the way JS ends his books. I can recommend this this book if you don't have anything else to read."
4,Perfect Nightmare: A Novel,"Coming from a huge John Saul Fan, this book is good. Not his usual style. More ""realistic"" than previous books. Still, I couldn't put it down."
2,What happened?,"I really enjoy John Saul's books. They are creepy and scary in a ""everyday"" manner. Hard to explain, but usually very intereting and fun read.Now comes Perfect Nightmare. Uh! what happened? The book is slow to the extreme and the main characters are not likeable in the least - which would be great if they were interesting. Lindsay is so whiny that I wanted to smack her upside the head a few thousand times. The whole family dynamics did not work.However the more horrific part is that this story was just not very scary or enjoyable in anyway. No suspense, no dread feeliing - nothing.Pass on this one. I think John Saul missed the mark big time -0"
2,"No chills, only ills","When I read the back of the book I really thought this would be an interesting read...but I was wrong. Although I finished it from front to back I still found it repulsive. There are issues in peoples lives that are not worth addressing in fiction and this was one of them. Unfortunately, to a lot of young girls monsters lurk in corners to invade their innocence and rip away the very essence of their self. They do not need to be reminded of the torment in any form. I do not condone reading anything that crosses the line such as this book. The most appauling part was when the author tried to make you feel sympathetic to the monster. I found it sickening to say the least. I still like John Saul, but if any other book is written like this one, I will wave goodbye to my favorite author forever."
2,Can You Count the One Sentence Pargraphs in this Book?,"John Saul is a writer for new readers who haven't yet learned what good writing is (teens). Forget about metaphors or real imagery appearing in his books, and all those one sentence paragraphs! How irritating are they?The story is what is now almost a cliche type of kidnapping story. A teenage girl (Lindsay) is kidnapped and held prisoner in a basement. Another girl is already there and a third is soon kidnapped as well. A serial kidnapper (and worse?)is on the prowl. Saul creates some poignancy in this novel with the mother of Lindsay (Kara) and her sense of desolation and sorrow. A decent mystery is here, but one has the sense that all this has been done before and done better."
3,"A quick read but the ""reveal"" of the kidnapper disappoints","Sometimes, writers corner themselves with a nice set of characters but they need to make one of them ""the killer/kidnapper/psycho.""I enjoyed this book because it kept me turning the pages. What I DIDN'T enjoy was the reveal of who the kidnapper was. There are two reasons:1) One VERY MINOR character (for no reason at all) makes a big deal of paying attention to a picture of the girl who will be eventually kidnapped. And there is NO REASON for this character to have this interest -- purely a red herring!2) Another much more significant character has a free afternoon -- ""To do whatever he pleases"" and it's written in an ominous way. Again, a red herring.In other words, Saul was just trying to mislead us the reader and then when you find out who the kidnapper is, it really doesn't make any sense.But, I kept reading, and so he accomplished his goal!"
3,Read like a movie!,"Oddly entertaining and easy to read. John Saul has a way of bringing creepiness into sight. Not one of his best books, but worth the time to read."
2,Predictable and not very believable,"The whole storyline is not very believable. Why couldn't they wait till their daughter graduated to move into the city? She was in her senior year of highschool, so it would have been less than a year.I could see a psychopath looking up girls to kidnap by searching houses currently for sale, but not the character who was doing it...and especially not because his sister molested him one time when he was little.The author tried to throw suspicion in 3 or 4 different directions, but the way he did it made it obvious what was happening.I've read other books by this author that were pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."
2,No Thanks.,"I can only drum up the courage to give this novel two stars. The storyline is old but what I really didn't like was the wordy writing. This was not tight writing and certainly not a typical Saul piece of work. I guess what turned me off was the character inconsistencies...especially the girl's father. Anyway, I don't recommend this one."
3,"Not bad, but not Saul's usual standard","This book seemed to be geared toward a younger reader audience. There's nothing wrong with that, but I think it should be touted as a young-adult genre so that adult expectations aren't so high. I would have loved it a pre-teen. As an adult, it seemed rather mild and even a little hokey, especially for John Saul. What happened to his ""Nathaniel"" or ""Suffer the Children"" storylines? Maybe he's getting bored? Teenagers between 12 and 17 years-old would really enjoy this book."
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a fizzle","Perfect Nightmare is the kind of book that grabs you by the throat and won't let go--keeping your attention and making you keep turning the pages until you have about 30 pages left. But then it ended like a limp handshake and all I could think was, ""WHAT?! That's all we get?!!!""Also, the character development could have been a bit better. I just didn't get the same ""feel"" for the characters as I usually do with Saul's novels.I'm a big fan of John Saul's writing, but unfortunately this is not his best work. If you are already a fan, it's worth a read, though. But I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"This is an average Saul novel. As always, the read was interesting and I finished the book in less than a week. People have mentioned that there is brutality toward children in this book, but it is not explecit. There is certainly stuff implied, but it is not written out luridly like some would have you believe. The story is basically about the disappearance of a teenage girl and her parents search for her and the stranger they believe took her. I figured out who it was about halfway through, but Saul throws out enough red herrings to keep you guessing throughout the book. The shift to first person perspective to the kidnapper was interesting and gives a real insight to his/her thought process. A decent read, but not the first Saul novel you should start with."
3,"Interesting Read, but very Dark....","I read this a few days after purchasing it locally. The book is not his best, but it is worth reading, and the storyline is pretty dark. If you don't want to hear about a psycho who kidnaps young teenagers, then this book is not for you. I do have to wonder how his mind could conceive such a script, because it really does sound very realistic. If you are a John Saul fan, I'd say read this one anyway, but it can wait until the paperback comes out. If you have never read Saul, don't judge his previous work by this one."
3,A Good Priest Video Primer,"Despite what another reviewer said, this is not concert footage. It is a collection of 10 Priest videos dating back to the British Steel days and ending with the videos they created for the Turbo album.Overall this is very entertaining, but many of the videos are dated in their production quality which is to be expected.As a huge Priest fan I want everything they ever did so this was a must have for me and I've had it on video and now on DVD, imported from Brazil.The highlights are the ""Hot Rockin'"" video as well as ""Freewheel Burning"" and ""You've Got Another thing Coming""."
5,Pop-Up Harley Book For Big Kids!,"I have owned and gifted out three of these pop-up Harley Davidson editions to my HOG pals. I have used mine as a coffee-table book, but to avoid wear and tear, I now have it boxed and stored, only to be brought out for special occasions ~ that's how much I treasure it! Beautifully crafted, very unusual and interactive ~ some pages invite assembly, others have hidden objects, and the book is full of interesting HD factoids. I think it's an ideal gift for any H.D. enthusiast."
3,"Ok, but wouldn't recommend this one to anyone else","I got this mainly for boating and fishing. I wanted cheap and didn't have my heart set on a lot of features. That said, I was a little disappointed to see that I couldn't even upload basic geographical data, like lake outlines or major roads. Also, if the batteries get even slightly low, it locks up regularly. It can be very frustrating. Also, I would much rather have a USB or some other interface for transferring data because it can be difficult finding a computer that has a 15-pin serial port on it. I was aware of this when I bought it, but am regretting it now.On the good side, it works, it's very solid and has a nice interface. For what I use it for it does the job. If you're looking to buy a new one, I would recommend spending a little more and getting the next model up."
1,Product features Stop working,"I bought the GPS 72 for kayaking because it floats and it has tide tables. At the turn of the year the Tide Tables started to display, ""Inaccurate Results"" and it stopped showing tide data. I contacted Garmin and they basically said, ""Too bad. Buy a new one because we stopped supporting this unit."" It was less than 5 years old. Don't buy Garmin Products because they build them cheap, they build them to stop working, just so you will have to buy another one to replace it. So, I actually considered buying another GPS72 (I thought they stopped selling them?) only to find out these newer units no longer have built in Tide Tables. They want me to buy the more expensive unit that has the Tide info. Not going to happen. Garmin just lost a customer."
1,Not User Friendly,I find this item very difficult to use and not very user friendly even with the help of the on-line manual. I find it very difficult to enter a way point. We geocache and I haven't done much since I replaced my broken one with this model.
4,Great product,C'est vraiment spectulaire de pouvoir ecouter Barzotti avant ses années de succès. There is a lot of great old songs in that CD.
3,Is there an echo in here?,"The exercises were good, but nothing new (squats and lunges.) The cheerleaders, however, were pretty lame. Some weren't doing the moves right (improper placement of feet, etc.) and it was really annoying to hear the ""head cheerleader"" repeat everything that Gay said: ""Six more!"" Blonde leader: ""Six more!"" Gay: ""Feet apart!"" Blonde leader: ""Feet apart!"" Are they hard of hearing or what? The constant prattle was more annoying than inspirational. I won't be keeping this one."
3,Viewing of the tape,"This tape had a lot of static in it. It was very difficult to view. The tape itself is awesome and a great workout. I used to own this long time ago, but this copy was not clear at all."
4,Thought provoking entertainment,"When I first picked up this book, I was interested in it because it was so old. As I read it, especially the first few chapters about his adventures in elementary school (I teach fourth grade) I was pleased. I feel better about the antics my students have gotten into. The rest of the book is an entertaining, yet infomative first hand account of the growth of the medical profession. We have come a long way. I am looking forward to seeing where we go."
5,One Great CD,One great cd done by a comedy group of peoople not well know in the ukOnce you have heard this cd you get a good idea what us comedy is all about.
2,Not great,Tabby is just an awful character. She literally had no impulse control when it came to Christien and it is absolutely pathetic. I get that she's young (21) but seriously? She's still that irresponsible and flat out dumb? We're supposed to believe that they're in love but all that was displayed was lust and a severe case of doormat on Tabby's part. The fact that he called her a slut and a hussy at what seemed like every chance he got was gross and I guess we're supposed to think that it's all because poor little Christien misunderstood something he saw when they were both younger? GMAB! Despite the fact that they both finally told each other that they loved each other NONE of that felt sincere or believable. Both Tabby and Christien are poorly written characters and their story is just sad (as in bad).
1,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Ms. Grahams, that said I really did not like either the hero Christien Laroche or the heroine Tabby. Tabby was slow-witted and immature.Christien's irresponsibility was ridiculous, seriously you have 6 weeks of unprotected sex with a seventeen year old girl and you don't at least talk to her in the intervening 4 years to maybe see if there were any consequenses to your actions.Tabby at least had youth as an excuse for the majority of her stupidity Christien however was older and not as easily excused.On top of that he's engaged to someone else when he re-enters Tabby's life and bed and fails to mention it. His excuses for his actions are lackluster and weak. The hero was based to much in reality if I wanted to see a irresponsible man that cheats on his Fiancee and impregnates children I would pick up the latest PEOPLE magazine or watch Maury"
2,same story line but the characters are just plain stupid,I got to the middle of the book and just stop. Then finished the book a month later Tabby made it too easy for him after the way he treated her and continues to treat her . This book was definitely a miss for Lynne Graham. I gave it 2 stars because it starts out good.
5,"Cap, please write more!","Wickedly funny, should appeal to a wide variety of people, from those looking for true life paramedic books to those who like to read of strange real life incidents. Captain Nickerson is definitely the guy I'd want to respond to my 9-1-1 call."
1,Black & White,This guide is in black and white so it is clearly completely worthless. I wouldn't have paid a cent for it had I known.
2,hmmmmmmm,its an alrite album for cutie lil kids hu love pop dat just vanishes. The album is cool but it's nothing that stands out. It's all music that you can dance do. It's not something I would waste my money buying. Lil kids won't really understand it and older kids won't really like it. I suggest you go and buy more worthwhile peoples albums like delta goodrem or stacir orrico. People who are unique
1,Showing off Wannabe,"I used to think Nikki Webster was cool. All my friends and I used to talk about her CDs and pretend to be like her. Looking back on it, I think she is a wannabbe. Come on, look at her, she is covered in make up, permed her hair, has weird clothes on with bright colors, her CD names are stupid like Let's Dance. OK, Nikki, let's dance. Let's Dance into the lake where we can stuff you in there!! She is so fake!!!! People want to be like her when she is just cpoying other people. She used to be OK, but now she is so up herself she has turned into Barbie. No wonder she hasn't made it big any where.Message Nikki, YOU'RE FAKE, YOU LOOK FAKE, AND YOU SING LIKE A CAT WITH A SORE THROAT. IF ANYONE WANTED TO HEAR YOU VOICE, THEY COULD PUT CATS UNDER WATER AND LISTEN TO THEM WHINE!!!!Everyone, please understand that if you listen to this rubbish, you'll get sick of it and want earphones. And that's the truth."
5,husband's fun,"my husband is the chess player.....got it for him and he now NEVER GETS OFF MY COMPUTER! he LOVES IT I , on the other hand am getting to HATE it."
1,Please please do not buy this money westing and disappointing software,"This is the worst chess software. I am writing this in year 2013, I have latest Mac book pro. I was too excited to get this software but as soon as I loaded the software my disappointment know no boundaries. I have used other chess software in 2007 or in 2006. Much much better then this useless software. In other software the the graphics were too too too good. I could change angle of chess board increase or decrease the size of chess board; the chess sets were much better then this one, and had much better 3d effects. Adding to that this software hangs up any time.Please please do not buy this money westing and disappointing software"
1,Do not buy - too many technical problems on Mac,Have tried to re-install about 3 times. Very slow on the Mac and always brings up error codes. Technical support is useless. Feral really should not sell this for the Mac as it is a disaster. It was one of the most expensive chess programs I ever bought.
1,Clunkiest Game Ever,"This program is, by far, the clunkiest piece of software I have ever installed on my Mac. Every other time I start the program it freezes up. When it does work it works slowly and lumberingly. The way the program handles is trying to play chess with a nine-year-old having learned the game for the first time. This is to say nothing of the supremely inelegant graphics and gameplay. I really wonder how this program is popular. It is probably only meant for PCs. Don't waste your money. It seems like it was adopted for Mac out of sheer greed."
4,Chess Game for Mac,"I couldn't find too many chess games for MAC. There's a lot of options in this game. I'm not real fond of having to put disc in laptop everytime I use game. I'm still learning how to use it, but it will do the job. I wish I could get a bigger chess board on screen while paying."
1,Do I hate CM 9000 or do I hate Macs,"I don't know whether it's my MacBook Pro that I hate or Chessmaster 9000 that I hate, but the combination of the two is absolutely toxic. It generally takes up to ten minutes for CM to load up; sometimes it crashes. Once it does load, it moves painfully slow. Operations that should occur instantaneously take upwards of two minutes while that maddening rainbow ball spins round and round. And if it takes more than two minutes, expect a crash. I truly hate this thing. Buy a PC and get Fritz or Rybka. This is really, really substandard,"
1,Chessmaster 9000 For Mac Will Not Run,"Although it is not stated in the product description or on the box itself, this program will not run on OS X Leopard 10.5.6. Additionally, Feral Interactive never responded to various requests for support. The product had to be returned."
2,This won't run on MAC Lion OS,All I can say is that it doesn't work on my MAC OS 10.7They should state what systems it will not run on.As it stands it just says it's recommended for 10.3.
1,Mac Chessmaster Is A Dud,"The chessmaster 9000 doesn't work on my mac running Mac OS 10.6. The screen cannot be resized making a postage stamp sized chess set impossible to view. As has been noted before, it requires the DVD to be installed to even work incorrectly! I sent 3 emails to FERAL interactive complaining about the above and have never received a reply. Don't buy this piece of junk..."
1,Chessmaster 9000 (mac),This has been a real frustrating experience. I still have not been able to load this program into my computer. Feral has two conflicting installation instructions. The company has ignored three email requests for help. After several attempts I was able to load the program. Now it shuts down stating there is an error within 5 seconds loading the program.
5,"""THE REAL DEAL""","If you want to play for the fun of it or to improve your game as well as have many diifferent options available to you like the kind of opponent you play, the kind of set up as far as how you see the board & the style of pieces and choice of board used the kind of atmosphere you play in and have a choice of competitive levels, ""WOW"" this is for you, Chessmaster 9000 is ""The Best"" Chess game I have incountered hands down. It even allows you to use a ""Mentor"" a Funtion thats built into the software if you choose to. Overall I give this game a {5 star Rating}Chessmaster 9000 (Mac)and thats why I bought it."
2,Tiger bug,"I bought this program on good faith, only to discover that important parts of the prgram do not run with OS 10.4 (Tiger). I've e-mailed Feral and have not as yet received a reply. Since they seem to have a 'beta' patch, they should make this known to all Tiger owners. If you have Tiger, I wouldn't buy this software until they have a real fix."
2,Doesn't seem to compatible with OS 10.5,"This is a great product but the support for the Mac seems to be a problem. I recently upgraded to Leopard and Chessmaster 9000 now takes forever to close dialog boxes. I've had no problems related to the speed of moving pieces or loading personalities that I've read about elsewhere. But, there are enough problems that I would stay away from this product for the time being. And, I have installed the patches, no help..."
3,Wonderful & Endlessly Annoying,"I agree with all aspects of the positive reviews on this product, as well as the negatives. The overriding problem with Chessmaster 9000 is the requirement that the disk be inserted during use. If it just sat there unobtrusively it would be a mild annoyance. But it whirrs to life randomly and sometimes stays on for minutes at a time. This while you are playing a game that requires rigid attention. It should be marketed as a random distraction engine that will either force you to hone your skills despite the ambient periodic noise and vibration, or quit. If Feral could somehow get past this (this is 2009, there has to be a less intrusive way to protect their product)they would have the perfect game. This a great and terribly frustrating product."
1,Doesn't work with Mac...no product support,"After playing one match, Chessmaster for Mac wouldn't work anymore. I wrote the company which sent me an email giving me a fix suggestion and saying, essentially: we really don't know why the problem exists. So Sorry. (Earlier I had bought Chessmaster 6000 for Mac...ebay, unopened package. It didn't work either.) My next email to them was ignored. We all know this is a great game, but it really doesn't work with Mac. And, someone, please tell me how they get away with such shoddy technical support? Wouldn't I love to sell a product which, if it doesn't work, well, too bad."
1,Doesn't work with OSX,"I tried installing this in two different MAC's (new) and both ""quit unexpectedly"". Feral claims there must be a problem with both new computers"
1,crash-o-matic for OS-X 10.6,"As long as you only open, play, this seems to work. However, this game takes minutes to open, crashes if you make changes during a game, crashes if you open mentor window during a game, crashes at the end of a game, crashes if you take back moves, .... Also, the CD has to be in the computer or the game won't even start. I paid good money for this and feel ripped off. Free chess games like Sigma Chess are more enjoyable."
3,Great read.,"It's a great read, but I was informed to read it for a scene study, plus it was too short for me. I like a good long book."
1,Can't review,I can't give a review for this book. I bought it for my daughter's college class and haven't read it. It would not be right for me to leave a review and that's the only reason I gave it one star.
3,Seems Dated Despite the Issues it Addresses,"Despite this play's dealing with late-twentieth-century issues, it seemed to me to come out a tradition from the first half of the twentieth century--derived largely from psychoanaltic thought--that one's motivations and behavior have little to do with spirituality and mostly to do with repression and sexuality. Then when I read the author's note I noticed that, indeed, he was inspired by those early-twentieth-century thinkers & writers. The play seemed old-fashioned to me.That said, the characterizations are first-rate, and I can't wait for the amazing Jeffrey Wright to reprise his Tony-winning performance as Belize when HBO airs their production of ""Angels.""I'd love to see a Part 3 where Joe and a new lover are married by a lesbian United Church of Christ pastor, demonstrating that it really is possible to be gay and Christian at the same time!"
3,Strange,I had to read this for a class I am taking. The story line was confusing from the get-go. I hate where you get left off at for part one.
2,"Speedy delivery, Not as described though","Over all, I'm satisfied with the purchase. However, it's supposed to be a brand new book, while what I got is definitely used already.It's not broken or anything, only has some pencil marks. But if I had known it was second-handed, I would just go for a used one; which would be even cheaper.BTW, the play itself is brilliantly written. Had it for my school project, and I really appreciate our teacher's choice. I'm going to get the second part as well.It wan the Pulitzer Prize in 1993. Highly recommend."
1,Bad lip sync,The sound of the instructor's voice and the movement of the mouth was way off and very distracting . This gave it a very amateur production feeling .
3,Enjoyable video and also available on demand,"First of all I want to say this is the last video I buy from amazon since their on demand feature doesn't work on my android, which is one of the reasons I got it but amazon has a weird issue playing videos on other devices except your computer and roku. So if you have an android maybe boycott amazon until they resolve this.Other than that I was very happy with the video. It feels like you're taking class and I like the russian vaganova style."
4,fantastic content!!!,"To start off, yes the video quality, production value and dubbing are pretty terrible. That being said, this video is the closest I've found to going to an actual ballet class. Really, the content is great. The barre exercises are cohesive and the music is really nice. I'm not sure if this video would be good for someone without previous ballet instruction as proper technique is only barely touched on in the last 2 minutes of the video, but for someone like me that's looking to supplement classes or be able to take class on my own schedule without having to leave the house, this video is great!"
1,I Cannot Recommend,This is perhaps theaterical ballet class. The teacher (V Kabaniaev?) shows barre in costume pajamas and from behind so one cannot see foot. I declined to watch further. Of course I cannot recommend in any way.
4,Cheap Cables,"Good cheap cables.To plug into amp is easy like all cables,but this cable has no static whatso ever!Unless your guitars electronics are alittle bad then it may sound bad.A cable can reduce your guitars true potential,but this doesn't lower it that bad.Monster cables seem alot better but unless your willing to spend 50$ on a cable these will do.The size seems good enough 12ft!This is good for people who wanna just play at their house or a small gig.For people who need cable for a big gig this isn't what you are looking for."
3,"Get this for ""Jump On Top Of Me Baby""","Everybody by now has heard the drearily B-O-R-I-N-G ""You Got Me Rocking,"" a song the Stones cut just as they were entering the decline of their career. Ah, but the ""B"" side - ""Jump On Top Of Me Baby"" a song from some obscure movie ""Pret A Porter"" MORE than makes up for whatever the seller is charging you for this. EXCELLENT music, stupid lyrics - the best kind - and I guarantee you'll be singing along by the second chorus!"
3,Beautiful but incomprehensible,"Nausicaa, by Mayao Miyazaki, is is one of the most popular and highly rated magna in Japan, but it gave me a lot of trouble. The art in this is terrific, but I could only make out the broadest outline of the story, even though the dialog has been translated to English. I think that I was reading the panels in the correct order, but frequently there seemed to be no discernible connection from one panel to the other. Probably it would be better to come back to this after seeing the anime."
5,One of the finest manga series ever,"There are two versions of this.The first is a perfect bound edition. The second is the larger version here.Both are excellent reads but the larger versions allows you to see the brilliance of Miyazaki's artwork (from a guy known more for animation). I have been told that the newer version is a more accurate translation but, not knowing Japanese, I can not confirm that. It is certainly an easier read because one does not have to squint.In terms of story, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a masterpiece. It blows Lord of the Rings out of the water. And this is coming from a person who hates almost the entire post-apocalyptic genre. I did think the ending came a bit suddenly and it did not necessarily wrap up every question I had.However, it is still one of the best graphic novels you can get.Highly recommended."
5,Great Toddler Fun,"This set is a lot of fun! The set is very forgiving for bad track alignment, getting stepped on by overeager toddlers, and other such destruction a toddler can unleash on toys. The components are simple and relatively rugged. Various add-ons are available at Wal-Mart and Target for $7 to $12."
3,Hillbilly Honeymoon,"This is not one of the better CDs that I have purchased. First of all the artist I was looking for ""Blind Alfred Reed"" is not even on it. I would not recommend to anyone."
1,No better than fisrt one,No better than Mathematics Calculus 1. Outdated in its slant on Calculus. Go back to the basics. Get a book!
1,Too stiff,"These spatulas are way too stiff for me. They don't bend to the shape of the container you're scraping like I want them to, so lots of the batter (or whatever) stays in the bowl. I much prefer the ones I have from Pampered Chef."
2,too stiff,"I bought these to replace two ailing Rubbermaid spatulas that I've had for 10 years.They are too stiff, so they don't do a good job of scraping bowls and such.They look good though, and we all know looks are important."
4,SPATULA REVIEW,One of the better spatulas i have used in recent years. the firm rubber makes cleaning bowls easy and they do not fall apart. german quality is very appreciated.
2,Not quite what I wanted,"I had hoped these would be made by Rubbermaid, which has a better quality rubber. Not as flexible as the old Rubbermaid spatulas, but better than what I've been able to find at the local big box stores."
2,Flimsy handles,Doesn't take much to break them. Scraping thick batter out of a bowl caused the handle to snap. Will get something sturdier next time.
3,maybe i'm wrong but i think......,"This book was rather shallow when it came to learning about the true pre. In some parts of the book, people seem to be like cheerleaders telling about how wonderful pre was and rarely speaking of his faults. Pre was, obviously, one of the dominant athletes when television started to broadcast sports on a regular basis. He helped amateur athletes in fighting for their rights. There is no doubt that he is a key athlete of the century. It just seems to me that this book scratched the surface of his life and ideals. Maybe there isn't enough information for an in-depth biography of his life, but i hope that another author will be able to delve deeper into his life and psyche that lives within those who knew his as well as saw him perform."
4,Inspiring Tale of A Running Legend,Probably one of the most inspiring biographical works I have ever read. The world was changed forever when Pre died. Great use of pictures as well as stories from those who new Pre to tell the story of the man that was a legend at 24 and still wasn't at his peak.
4,Inspiration,"I read Tom Jordan's book in its first incarnation back in 1980. I'm glad to see it updated with more photos and information, though I wish someone would do an in depth biography on Pre the man. Steve Prefontaine has served me as inspiration to run since I first read this book, even though he was already gone when I got to know his life. I would recommend this book to anyone who desires to run. I also recommend both of the movies that have been made of his life. They round out his character in a way the book does not, and while they cover many of the same incidents each portrays different things too. It's like watching Pre come alive. Read the book then watch the movies. You can't go wrong."
3,Not as good as the Film,I have always firmly believed that the book is always better than the film. Not this time though. The guy was a legend & will always be associated with Nike. A very big compliment. Watch the Film !!
3,Interesting Book,"This book did give an interesting overview of this great athletes life. What was somewhat disappointing was the significant amount of space describing so many of his races. While it is interesting to learn about specific events and races he participated in, it seemed to go on for too long describing these races."
5,great book about a great runner,got this book because i am a huge pre fan. lots of great facts about pre. he is the greatest college funner ever. this book will make you want to go to oregon and run the track at Hayward Field.
5,Very inspirational book!,"An avid runner, I enjoyed the book immensely. Read it before you hit the roads."
2,A dissapointment,"After hearing much about the much publicized ""Pre""I was disappointed with the actual book. While theactual story of Pre's life seems somewhat compelling, the author didn't seem to do the man justice. Instead of bringing the drama and intensity of Steve's life and races to the page, it read merely like a box score. Poorly written and poorly developed, a big disappointment."
3,This is not the IMAX movie with Sting Soundtrack,"Though this is a worthwhile video documentary, it is NOT the IMAX movie with the Sting soundtrack"
4,Coolest idea by an artist in a long time,"This is the coolest idea by an artist in a long time. How many times have you been to a concert and wished you had a recording of it? Well, the guys of PJ have given it to you. Each city's concert is on a separate disc. I hope to get more of the discs from other cities, but the Memphis concert is rockin. Two discs worth of Live Pearl Jam!"
4,It does the job well for a reasonable price.,"I needed something other than pastry bags to inject custards and jams into paczkis. After doing quite a bit of research I found this product which was priced much less than other creme injectors. Shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It worked great for my pastry cream, custard, and raspberry jam. The only issue I had was overfilling the paczkis ;) If you need an inexpensive way to inject pastries and you aren't doing it all the time I highly recommend this injector."
4,This is a great Series!,"My friends and I Love this series of games! It's a shame that they are so hard to find, espically the earlier ones. This one was great for Halloween it made for easy decorations and costums. However, the solution was impossible to figure out. We still had a ton of fun playing. I've found that the games later in the How to Host series have very wacky endings and solutions are really difficult. I perfer the earlier ones try Last train from Paris and Watersdown affair --that is if you are lucky enough to find them!"
5,A must see for silverchair fans everywhere!,"This DVD is the best! I live in the US where silverchair videos are hard to come by, so it is nice to have a collection of all their videos. Emotion Pictures is funny as well, it is nice seeing what silverchair are like behind the scenes. This DVD is perfect for the essential chair fan!"
4,A complete Silverchair video package,"I'm not a huge Silverchair fan but I like them. This is a package of their videos from beginning to somewhere before the Young Modern album I think. It is interesting to watch them progress as they age in the videos and you can see Daniel's physical changes. The music is good and the video and sound quality are also good. There is some footage of them taken on videocamera in places where they are playing, ""out on the street with Silverchair"" type of stuff. I would have prefered a live in concert type of DVD but I got this one cheap and it works for watching while I ride my exercise bike."
3,Good for a movie made in the 80's,"In response to M. Reinking's review, I agree that Disney's The Little Mermaid was the best Little Mermaid movie. And the quality of the acting and etc. of the Faerie Tale Theatre version is a little sad, but it was made in the 80's..or early early 90's...Also, she did become a Spirit of the Air in the original Hans Christian Anderson story...because she spared the Prince's life. So I value this version of the story, because it's the first (and so far, only) true version of the actual story. I think that's what was good about all the Faerie Tale Theater movies. Also, if anyone happens to know...there was a bunch of fairy tales that used to show on the Disney Channel. Does anyone know what those were called? Please, let me know..."
5,A GREAT FILM IN THE CLASSIC 80's SERIES,"This film takes us under the sea to explore the world of Pam Dawber as the Little Mermaid, curious about the world above. Treat Williams plays the perfect prince and Karen Black plays a surprisingly beautiful sea witch. The sets are wonderful and the music is hauntingly beautiful. The special effects are a little fishy, but that's okay. This film is a wonderful adaptation of H.C Andersen's classic story. You won't forget this movie. Highly Recommended.A+"
1,"Awsome software, bad management.","RoboDemo does a pretty good job of recording demos, but the company is so scared of piracy that they made the software impossible to use in certain situations: for example, if you want to record something on your laptop and edit it on your desktop computer you have to buy two copies of the software. There is no way around this. If your computer crashes and you have to re-install it, you have to endure a 30 minute wait on hold to get someone to give you a new product key so you can install it again.In addition, if you want any tech support you have to pay eHelp hundreds of dollars for them to even talk to you.This company needs to get a serious clue. eHelp should be rename eNoHelp."
2,Does Not Configure to Harman Kardon AVR's,"I ordered this product and went through the set-up process for my TV (sony), VCR (mitsubishi), DVD (sony) and then found it could not be configured to my Harmon-Kardon AVR55 home theater five speaker system. When I called the company directly, the business(?) phone is answered ""cash n gold"" and the enterprise sounds like it operates from a warehouse with loudspeakers interrupting anyone you are speaking with. The product appears to have some cool features but to not have the set-up code for a top-of-the-line Harman Kardon home theater system is unfortunate and somewhat misrepresentative."
3,Interesting Fun Device,"It is a bit tempramental with the commands sometimes, but if you actually read and follow the instructions, it does work!. The key is to use a normal voice & if you find it is not recognizing it, then do it over. The infra-red is a nice powerful signal in mine at least and I like the fact I dont have to acually point it at the device. Over all, good but way too expensive. Get an X-10 8 in 1 learning remote instead (it also will control your lights in the house). Much better value."
2,Not what I expected,"I have a bunch of Photoshop books, and being a digital photographer, I did not find this book helpful at all for my interests. It is a great book for learning how to do artwork with Photoshop but has nothing about photographs. I wanted to write a review so that way the next person looking for a book on messing with your photographs, would not buy this book. I recommend The Photoshop Book for Digital Photographers by Scott Kelby if you are looking for Photoshop methods to play with your pictures."
4,Interesting,I read this for a class and thought it was very interesting and introspective. I like the author's gentle approach to death and dying.
2,What do you think of Zen Buddhism?,"I cannot share the strong recommendations given by the other reviewers. The book is very heavily influenced by Zen Buddhism, and many of the thoughts and suggestions flow directly from Buddhist beliefs. For example, if one does not believe in reincarnation, many of the suggestions in the book make no sense at all. The book is mostly well-written and I suspect would be appreciated best by those with a strong belief in Eastern religions. Personally, I can't say I benefited much from this, though some points were quite interesting, such as that 'desire' is generally a source of pain."
5,Life changing,"I first read this book in 1990 and I didn't want to read it because the title was such a turn-off. But my reading group was into it, so reluctantly I picked it up. By the time I went to the next book group meeting I was maybe the most enthusiastic reader in the room, altho others were blown away by it too. It was a complete 180 degree shift. I'm rereading it now in 2011 and it still has the same jaw-dropping power to make me pause and think about my life at a deep level. Though it is a book about dying, it has even more to say about living, about how we judge ourselves and others, and how we connect with people and negotiate life in general. This is a must read for anyone in the field of psychological counseling and for everyone who wants to live to the fullest."
3,real chants but low fidelity or previously released material,"There's a lot of chant for your money, especially if you buy it used. These are real Gregorian chants, and the Ambrosian Polyphonic choir seems live in liturgy, but it's incredibly low fidelity, if that matters. Also annoying is the labeling by Mass and Mass part, without the Latin title.The Vienna Hofburgkapelle discs (2) are better recordings, but they are reissues of previously released materials (on ""Mystical Chants,"" etc.). I tried to match songs on my itunes because I am well aware of this tendency to repackage and rename old chant collections and sell them as new releases, but those discs were changed in track order.If you don't have these recordings, they are highly recommended as pure Gregorian chant. The Ambrosian disc has mixed and alternating male and female voices."
4,Upstate New York City Street Maps,"This is a fabulous tool for finding your way around! I have used it for Garage sales mostly, but also find it handy when invited out for events like baby or bridal showers, birthday parties etc. The copyright is 1990 so it is a bit out of date. I am hoping an updated version will appear! would give it 5 stars in 1990, but need to rate lower due to it being out of date."
1,A repeat of others,Every health nut seems to think we should all be eating nuts and tree bark. In an ideal world this would be ok but most people are not concerned.
2,"Good reasoning, poor conclusion","The book has very good and practical ways of enjoying the Sabbath. If you are only satisfied with the ""How"" question, then this book is for you. If you are also concerned about the ""When"", this book, intentionally or otherwise, gives a very wrong conclusion on the question on that question.From the biblical record, it is very clear that the Sabbath is what we call Saturday today, not Sunday. But the writer's conclusion is that Sunday is the Sabbath - a bad and very wrong conclusion."
2,Boring and very slow paced,"The movie showed off the different aspects of powers in the games, but had a shoddy storyline. The Krogan were drawn really weird."
3,For ME fans who want more,"I was a huge fan of the games, so it was a no-brainer that I would be intrigued by this short anime film which is basically the story of the Vega character and what is discussed in the cargo bay while Vega and Sheppard spar near the beginning of ME3. The story is fine, but no where near the scope and importance of the games. It is like a brief aside to the galactic epic which the games put forth.My biggest disappointment was with the art style. I've seen 20 year old anime with better character art. While there were inserts of CGI elements (mostly ships and technology), the actual characters were very poorly drawn. I was hoping for something along the lines of Ghost in the Shell or even the CGI Final Fantasy films and Appleseed (from 2004).So, I'd only recommend this for those who loved the games and want more."
2,"Ummm, no.",Decent animation but the execution of a Saturday morning cartoon. Cliche after cliche and unnecessary plugs to the game characters. Cheesy...Spend less money on voice actors and more on writing.
1,Does not follow established lore. Also too expensive for 45 minutes.,The movie is only 45 minutes. I did not research that well enough before buying. Also it does not follow the story very well. Do not suggest this buy to anyone. Maybe for 2.99 to 3.99. Maybe.
5,A Perfect Fit for Mass Effect Fans!,"While Paragon Lost is animated and features characters other than Commander Shepard, the story fits great between Mass Effect 2 and 3. The plot is great in regards to the Mass Effect universe and fills in a few gaps/questions about James Vega. It also includes choices that make the Mass Effect games so compelling and exciting, and makes you truly understand where the characters are coming from.I don't write many reviews, but as a Mass Effect fan I strongly recommend this! (And would love to see another movie in the future from Bioware!)"
2,Unbelievably disappointing,"Virtually none of the great things about the Mass Effect video game series were present in this DVD. Storyline was kept to an absolute minimum in order to make way for intense violence. This works in a video game, under specific pretenses, but is not what I expect from quality anime. Save your money and buy the DLC for one of the Mass Effect video games that you already own- you're going to enjoy that much more!If you feel strongly about buying anime, though, I would recommend the Ghost in the Shell seasons or films involving Miazaki. (The former for an intensely intellectual storyline and the latter for industry-known cinematography)."
4,Decent adaptation,"I downloaded Paragon Lost on my Playstation, and I thought it was pretty decent. I was happy they got Freddy Prinze to add his voice, although neither Keith David or Lance Henrikkson reprised their roles as Cpt. Anderson and Adm. Hackett. I enjoyed the humor and action, and was impressed with their uses of so many of the weapons we love from the game. I think any true fan will enjoy seeing the backstory of one of our favorite (though sadly not romanceable) characters. I enjoyed it, and I think you will too."
2,Mass Effect Paragon Lost - Rent before Buying,"Mass Effect: Paragon Lost takes place between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 in the video game saga. It follows the early career of Alliance Marine James Vega, an NPC in Mass Effect 3, providing some background to his character in the game.I found the overall quality of the anime to be very poor; substandard - from character design and plot, to the scripting and the voice-over acting. It felt more like watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon animated by high school students, than a top-notch production the Japanese and BioWare are notorious for producing. I lost interest about 5 minutes into the story, however I forced myself to watch it entirely; determined to get my money's worth. I highly recommend that people rent this movie first before purchasing it."
4,Beter than expected,"My first impression of this movie from the commercials was of disappointment. It simply looks like generic anime with a Mass Effect theme. However it turned out to be quite entertaining, nothing special, but worth watching. The characters were interesting, the plot satisfactory, and the action and romance were both good. While this is more for anime fans than Mass Effect fans both groups should enjoy Paragon Lost. Just keep your expectations low."
5,Short but very good!,Although this movie only runs 45 minutes i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie! A good buy for any fan of the games :)
5,Scifi,"Great movie for all gamers and animation fans please go buy it but, not not for younger kids mature only."
4,I loved it,great buy for the money . would deal with this again in many ways it was a great experice . all i got to say
4,Fixed my wrist problems!,"i bought this mouse because of all the reviews saying it helped alleviate wrist problems from rsi/carpal tunnel and it worked for me too. of course, adjusting my workstation, etc also was a factor, but since i got this mouse a few months ago i've forgotten how much i used to be in pain. my only complaint is that my hands are small and it's a little big. it's very sensitive (small movements move the mouse a lot) and takes some getting used to, but it's great and i would highly recommend trying it."
1,Broken after two weeks of use,"I bought this mouse hoping to ease my wrist pain... seems to have worked for others but only made my problem WORSE. If you have a longish hands/fingers, do NOT use this mouse, it will be a strain to click the buttons.Worst of all, after only 2 weeks, the mouse just stopped working -- no red light from optical system, just dead. Junk.And I had thrown away my receipt, so it was $65 down the drain.I now use the cheap Kensington track ball (great except for lack of scrolling) -- it works left and right handed, too."
3,"Comfortable, but prone to erratic behaivour","In terms of comfort this mouse is very good, the position of the hand is neutral and despite the size the weight is very light and it glides easily. Tactile feel of the button pushes is just okay though (I prefer the feedback of the cheaper microsoft mice), but the biggest issue is that the mouse tends to lock up every hour or so for a few seconds or behave erratically. This happens although i use a proper non-reflecting mousepad and other mice have not had this problem. Also, a colour other than purple would be good."
4,Best Ergonomic Mouse,"I regrettably tried the 3M Ergonomic Mouse first (low quality, poor optical tracking, no scroll wheel). The Evoluent is much much better. It's high-quality, easty to get used to, and just plain works. I wish it were cheaper, but eliminating wrist pain is well worth the cost. My one gripe: I like to pick my mouse up to move it, and this one provides nothing grab onto when doing so. I remedied that with some folded black electrical tape to make a couple protruding ""lips"" above my thumb and pinky. I hated to spoil the mouse's good looks with tape, but it works. There's no better ergonomic mouse.Feb 25, 2009 Update: I have been using this mouse every day at work for more than 3.5 years now and still love it. No problems, no complaints, no wrist pain whatsoever. I would change the rating to 5 starts if Amazon would let me."
3,Good for normal use,"This mouse did alleviate my wrist pain almost immediately. I was able to keep working, and that in itself made it worth the purchase.I will warn those who do graphic design or need detailed click and drag features. This mouse can be frustrating. Clicking sideways can at times cause your mouse to move the way you clicked... Not a problem for normal business users, but for high precision detail graphic work, etc. It takes some getting used to. (I use mine until my wrist is feeling better and then go back to my normal mouse where I can be more accurate.)"
1,Ergonomic Mouse?,"The Evoluent Vertical Mouse seemed like a good idea at first. The hand is in the natural angled hand-shake position instead of horizontal to the desk surface. But this mouse is entirely too large and not quite angled right for a persons hand, and as a result, not accurate or speedy. The heel of the hand needs to use the desktop as leverage for speed and accuracy, but was too high on the mouse so my fingers could reach the buttons.There was very little control and I returned it. My hands are definitely not small, and I own and operate my own computer sales and consulting service...so I am very interested in something that will help deter wrist and carpel tunnel problems. But I tried an Air Mouse and it is the best!"
5,Anyone with wrist pain,I have had the mouse for about 6 months and love it. It has resolved all of my wrist discomfort and another person in my office has bought one after using mine for a day.
4,Untwist my arms,"I first tried this mouse at my coworker's cube, and it feels so good I decided to buy it. After using it extensively at home, I really feel a difference it makes by not twisting the bones in my arms using this verticle orientation.I did not need to install any drivers to use this mouse with Windows XP SP2. The only complain I have is that the 3 buttons on the mouse take some time to get use to. The third button is actually a ""back"" button, which I seem to click instead of the right mouse click.And now I wish there's a vertical keyboard, too!"
5,Ergo Mouse for the 21st Century,"The Evoluent Vertical Mouse-2 should be on display in the Smithsonian Institute! It's the first computer input device I've found that conforms to the anatomy of the human hand in such a way, that its ergonomic benefits are immediately realized. After just one day, I quickly adapted to the vertical dynamic and I was hooked.Most people who buy this device are those with medical issues and I'm no different. However, this mouse really should be considered by anyone who spends a lot of time on a computer. Following several months of daily use, I can attest that the Evoluent mouse prevents the on-set of wrist pain, feels great in your hand, and is actually fun to use!by: Digital Dude"
5,best mouse i have found,I have rheumatoid arthritis and most of my job entails using a mouse. every mouse before would cause a flareup of my arthritis. i would have to switch hands throughout the day because of the strain to my wrists and hands. my company got me the evoluent vertical 3 and immediately felt the difference. i have had no flareups since using this mouse. thank you so much
4,Good for wirst problems,"Have had it for about 3 weeks now and my wrist problems are already starting to get better. Hard to work with at first since its so different, but once you are used to it, it's a great conversation starter."
5,wonderful design,"My biggest concern: would I adapt quickly to the radically different design?The result: a big YES!This mouse if very comfortable. I had just begun to feel the beginning hand strain of normal mouse use when my office bought this for me. Immediately, my hand started relaxing and getting better.Pros: comfortable, intuitive, nice control softwareCons: have it tried this for gaming, but im guessing its probably not a great shape for it. but who knowsOverall: really wonderful mouse."
2,You should be arrested for robbery at these prices!!!,"I understand the toy is discontinued, I also understand in the worth going up because it's not available but NOT 600% profit for a kid's toy that is priced at $70 when it came out! I could understand even maybe $180 at most, but $300?!?! Are you crazy. This set is fun but not at $300. do yourselves a favor and look for it at the website [...]. Or wait for someone who doesnt need their head examined to put this up for sale."
5,Love it!,"My 5 month old son loves this rattle! He likes to hold on to the ribbons and chew on the green face part (which is the opposite of what I expected him to do!). He'll chew on it and talk to it happily for quite a while, which is saying something for a baby with an attention span of 2 seconds!"
3,"Fine, if you like average","This coffee is fine, if you like average. But, both my husband and I like a rich bold taste without bitterness. We adore the flavor of the Carmel Kiss in particular. If you want a nice smooth cup of coffee with just a hint of toffee, this is for you."
4,Telling it like it is (or was).,"I picked up this book knowing nothing about it, and I have to say it was a real stroke of luck. This book gives a totally honest view of New York society in the 1930's. The whole speakeazy culture is expertly described by an author who has clearly lived in that environment. It's interesting as well to see how much they could get away with in those days; there is a great deal of inuendo in these pages which goes well with the books general theme of looking beneath the surface of things, in particular the image of America as a respectable, clean-living nation. It is also interesting to note that this book was banned in Britain for years after it was first published."
4,This book surprised me,"I don't know what I was expecting, but BUtterfield 8 turned out to be a surprise. I particularly enjoyed the dialog, sometimes dated but mostly not dated at all. The casual and frequent use of the n-word tells you a lot about racial attitudes in 1931. I like it."
1,Worst novel I have ever read,"Pretentious, Ivy League lowlifes dedicate their efforts to binge drinking and cheating on their wives/husbands/lovers. No exceptions: there is no likeable character in the book. The dialogue is stilted for the men, unbelievable for the women. The plot does constant 180's for no apparent reason. There's an internal dialogue near the end where Gloria, the ""heroine"" disgustingly discusses what it's like going to the bathroom in a speakeasy. Worst novel I have ever read, beating out even ""Atlas Shrugged."""
3,It looks like I am watching US movie in 1930s,"I just read this book on my way home from office and whenever I read,it gives me wider view of US in 1930s. I still have long way to go to finish reading this book. On the other hand, My intimacy against US literature is getting narrower. If anybody there who can help me to finish this novel, contact me by clicking koreays@hotmail.com"
1,this is actually ZERO stars--- because item never arrived,"I purchased this magazine on January 21, 2007 and it has yet to arrive (May 31, 2007) It was an expensive subscription that never arrived -- save your money!!!!"
4,Okay product,This hair was gorgeous at first then over time the dye faded to an ugly brown but all in all the product was pretty nice
5,Best black hair dye ever!,"I love this color and this brand. I've dyed my hair black many times with many different brands, but this is the best! I have naturally dark blonde hair, and it doesn't take color well. Most of the time the color just washes out, even if it's supposed to be permanent. It's the worst with black dye because I end up looking like a zebra with blonde streaks through my black hair. That never happned with this hair color, though. It stayed black, and it's such a beautiful color too! Also, it didn't dry out my hair."
3,Okay product,"I love the color but the blue washes out within 2 weeks,I don't think I will buy this product agian unless I just want blue in for fun"
3,Disappointing Conclusion to the MedStar Books,"Star Wars: Medstar 2: Jedi Healer by Steve Perry and Michael Reaves was the conclusion to the MedStar books, and I have to say it did not live up to the first book and overall was a bit of a disappointment. The story was prediactable. The struggles of Barriss in regards to the so called ""wonder drug"" was overrated. It just didn't involve me with the characters as much as the first book did. While there were some humorous elements and some interesting relationships, the identity of the spy at the end was no surprise and the authors failed to emotionally involve the reader in the story the way they did in the first book. The book was technically well-written and it was not the worst Star Wars book ever written, in fact I would put it in the average to slightly above average Star Wars books categories, but it just wasn't as strong as I'd hoped it would be."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I enjoy how these authors write. The characters really come to life after the first book. It's still not the most exciting Star Wars book I've read, but it sure isn't the worst one either. Not too much to say...overall I think that the Medstar books are worth reading."
5,Excellent conclusion to the Medstar series,"Jedi Healer was every bit as good as Battle Surgeons. The story of life in a Republic Mobile Surgical Unit (known as a Rimsoo) on Drongar continues. This book starts off on a sad note since Zan Yant, Jos Vondar's best friend, died in the last chapter of Battle Surgeons. Also, the identity of the spy from book 1 is still unsolved. The story keeps getting better and better as ""accidents"" start occuring. The Rimsoo's climate systems begin malfunctioning, causing snow when it's normally hot and humid, a bota shuttle blows up, a portion of the Medstar in orbit explodes, etc. Only Barriss Offee believes these weren't accidents. In a chapter near the end she begins suspecting people of causing it. Finally, the Seperatists launch an attack and the spy is discovered. Despite the Medstar books feeling far too short, Jedi Healer was a great ending to a great series."
2,Overall disappointing,"I bought the first book (Medstar I) and although I thought it was not too well written, I was interested enough in the characters to pick up this book. If it were not for the fact that I am a bit of a completist, and have ALL of the Star Wars books from every series, I'd not bother with this book. I'll only pick up more books in this series (if there are any) because of wanting to have all the books for my collection. Not well written, boringly predictable, and generally just fluff."
1,what a waste of money,"i recieved this product last week and it was a disappointment for me.the product was not in a good condition when i recieved it.the plastic side of the box was tear off and it was sealed by a tape and when i opened the box was missing a part.called amazon about this problem and advice to call the shipper to resolve the problem so i did and it take 4 days before they call me and respond to my email,they say will send the missing part but until now i didn't get anything.lastly i suggest that they should put this ietm in a packaging box to protect the item."
2,A major disappointment,"It's obvious that the producers had good intentions for STRANGE INVADERS. Unfortunately I found the result tired, forced and lazy; despite the presence of cult faves Kenneth Tobey (THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS), June Lockhart (TV's LOST IN SPACE) and Fiona Lewis (DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN, THE FURY). The acting is ham-fisted and this ""spoof"" of 50s alien invasion movies is almost a complete wash out."
2,"disorganized, by author or publisher","I read all three books and they are out of sinc, book one should be book 2 or maybe 3 it is hard to tell in any case they are really hard to read in any kind of order, the main seal is to hard to believe and it really borders on bordom and same thing over and over."
2,"Good Horror, Bad Wishmaster","This was a good horror flick but a terrible Wishmaster. The Djinn gets physical instead of mental. Seems like the Director made this film for younger audiences ( set on a college campus ) A true Wishmaster fan would't mind if it was an insurance siminar! Plus there were two guys playing the Djinn! Bottom line, PAY ANDREW DIVOFF WHAT HE WANTS AND BRING THE REAL DJINN BACK!!!! This movie without Divoff is like watching Psycho without Norman Bates! Don't buy it. Rent it !!"
2,I wish for Andrew Divoff.,"This movies lacks in many areas. First, it lacks seriously in creativity. It starts out with a young college student suffering from nightmares and trying to deal with a tragic accident that happened when she was young. From there she finds the hidden gem and unleashes the Djinn. Second, the Djinn that they have in this movie does not come close to the Djinn from the previous 2 movies. Also, this Djinn only shows up in true form only a few times in the movie. They probably shot all of the Djinn scenes over a few day period to save money on makeup costs. Some of the death scenes are somewhat entertaining, but they could have thought them out a little more. The movie could have been made with a little more effort and probably would have had better results. Hopefully they can correct their errors on Wishmaster 4, which I heard that they are making."
1,I Burned this one!,"This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. I love Wishmaster 1&2 but this was horrible! It didn't even have Andrew Divoff (the djinn) in the movie. It didn't follow the Wishmaster rules. Like he would force people to make wishes rather than trick them into selling their soul. After the movie I was so depressed that I had spent any money on that movie, that I burned the movie in a burn barrel rather than ever even look at that movie again!Take my advise, if you MUST see it, RENT IT. FOR GOD SAKE DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Djinn really better than mustard? ...NOT,"The evil ""Djinn""...HAA!!! not even if not laughable to the tilt. Where did they get the outfits during that battle in the park. I mean it looks like one of the ninja turtle villiens but much much weaker. OMG that fight was so bad it wasn't even funny...were talking about slow motion swings that i could avoid those moves by not even trying. I do admit that if you like gushing blood....there is plenty here to see.I hope the original is better then this installment but i have no plans of watching it after this pile of evi(less). You might want to watch it to complete the trilogy if you enjoy the first ones. This movie is just so lame from beginning to end....didn't scare me one bit. Bad direction to boot."
4,PURE FUN!!!!,"This movie was a really fun one to watch. I went to rent this simply because I like Wishmaster and this one is probably the 2nd nastiest movie ever made! (Only rivaled by Dead Alive) A girl in this movie pukes her insides up. It's a great gore film, but it isn't scary."
4,Truely amazing!,"To be precise, a very gory and violent film. 'Beyond the gates of hell' proves horror films can simply exceed bats, vampires or haunted houses. Witness some genuine horrifying stuff here. The film may frighten or disgust you but its hard to ignore it. A.J Cook was amazing, so was John Novak. May not be a brilliant film, but definitely worth a watch!"
1,Very bad and stupid movie,"I loved wishmaster 1 and 2, they are my all time favorite horror movies. this movie isnt a thing like the first 2. It is a discrace to the series. it was a low budget film so all the effects are cheesy, the djinn looks different (bad costume). a different actor plays the djinn (very bad actor). the dialoge of the movie is bad as well. remember how the stone was in a statue in 1 and 2? well now its mysteriously in a stupid puzzle box, the djinn throws people around and acts like an idiot. he has powers even if hes not wished to do so. there is pointless nudity in it common to cheap horror flicks. its just an all around BAD BAD BAD movie, nothing like one and two. I rented this movie, if I had bought it i'd return it or burn it. never watch this movie if you liked one and two, it will only disapoint you."
3,Not the same!,"Did not keep the original wishmaster so the move fell short of its goal. To bad the budget was not large enough to get the real wishmaster. It is worth watching, but not to buy the movie. Rent it if you can find it."
2,Bad!!,"Now after seeing the first 2 'Wishmaster' movies, I had high expectations for this movie. Apparently, they were too high...what hurts this movie, is that it's a total 360 turn from the first 2 movies. What this movie tries to be is a 'Scream' & a ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movie...which isn't saying too much, since they were mere silly movies, than horror movies. Too many just average actors & no pazzazz to it. Jason Connery as the human form of the Djinn isn't convincing. Andrew Divoff, who played the first Djinn character, was great. Such evilness to him. If you're a fan of the first movies, go see it, but don't expect a horror movie."
2,NOT AT ALL ENOUGH FOOTAGE OF THE DJINN DEVILISH MONSTER!!!!!!!!!!!,"What ruined this movie was the fact that the Djinn(who looks like a devilish monster)was only shown for about 8 minutes(or less)throughout this entire 90 minute movie.(I did add up the minutes).And for most of the time,the Djinn was transformed into a blonde guy with beard and mustache that looked SO BORING!!!!!! When I watch a horror movie,I want to see a hideous looking monster for a good amount of time not only for 8 MINUTES or less!!!! Especially of the fact that the Djinn in devilish monster form looks extremely realistic and frightening.Too bad they didnt show much more of him in this hideous form.Im very upset."
2,"Horror movie, not Wishmaster","This was a great horror flick but terrible for the Wishmaster series. Seemed like the director was trying to lure younger audience by staging it at a college. If you are a true fan of the Djinn, it wouldn't matter if he was at an insurance siminar! Also, two different people played the Djinn. For the Djinns sake and the Wishmaster movies, PAY ANDREW DIVOFF WHAT HE WANTS AND BRING HIM BACK!!! He is the only one. Its like replacing Norman Bates in Psycho, it just doen't fit."
1,Not even worthy of 1 star....,"I've been having a Wishmaster marathon after having never seen any of them. I was REALLY impressed with the first. It was original, gory, disturbing, and....SCARY! It had some genuine creepy moments that surprised me!Part 2 was OK. Definitely not as good as the first but not AWFUL. It still had some fun moments and was just cheesy enough to get by.This movie, however, was devoid of all scares and almost completely lacking in the Djinn department. Seriously...what were they thinking when they wrote this??? It's the worst franchise sequel I have ever laid eyes on! Not a scare in sight and some of the WORST, most poorly put together gore scenes ever. Soooooooo completely lame and non-scary. VERY disappointing. I am watching part 4 now and am thinking it is going to turn out very similar to the way part 3 did. So far, it's looking more like a cinemax softcore porn then a horror film. Maybe that will change...oh well!Pass this up!!! COMPLETELY WORTHLESS GARBAGE!!!"
1,garbage,"Stupid. The Djinn goes crazy on people through the climax without anyone having wished his powers loose. On top of that we had a wonderful excess of college kids running away scenes. The characters were garbage, the plot forgettable and the whole ending totally forced. Fastforwarded through plenty of the film after I got sick of pointless or extra long scenes, just stopping long enough to catch up on the plot. So maybe I missed some single line of dialogue that redeemed the entire film but actually that's entirely unlikely. It was awful and unwatchable. Luckily there's no connection between films after the second one so if you're looking to watch the entire series, you can skip from Wishmaster 2 right to Wishmaster 4 and not miss anything. But if you're like me and really want to watch the whole series, just keep your finger on the fast forward button so you can save yourself some bad film hassle."
3,it sure isn't beyond the gates of cinemas,"well...this film was alright... i had thought the 3rd one was the last one, but hopefully the 4th is better...1st one was the best though..I'm going to give out a spoiler or two though right now, so beware...it does definitely has it downs (the college party scene, the kissy kissy ending, and you might, just might be able to get one jump out of it). However, the good parts of this was...well, mainly the gore...the blood was pretty good as far as horror films go...the girl who thought she was too fat and the Djinn made her puke her fat out was pretty outstanding effects...i did like that alot..that basically made the film have 2 and a half stars. i just hope the Djinn wins and the gates of hell open up in the 4th one...maybe i could wish it!"
5,Open-End Slack Hanger Set,We had our closets professional organized and the salesman recommended these hangers because they don't take up as much room in the closet. They are great and hold the pants firmly on the hanger and the look is so nice. Great product.
1,Permanently out of print!,"Misterjaw is a forgotten cartoon that got cancelled 30 years ago because nobody watched it. Demand is so low, that the chances of a DVD don't even exist. Besides, fish should be broiled, not seen."
1,Terri's wrong as usual,"Question for Terri: if Misterjaw is so great, then why are his cartoons out of print? C'mon, Terri: ANSWER THE QUESTION! Anyway, these cartoons are cheesy. Check out any Tarantino film instead."
1,Let's set the record straight!,"The delusional five-star reviewers are mentally insane. This cartoon FLOPPED! It has been out of print for 30 years! There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY this show will EVER appear on DVD! Misterjaw is an obscure cartoon that met a quick death, as kids started watching more interesting shows on TV. Besides, you can't even buy this VHS tape: not here or anywhere else! So, it's time to move on, kids. Review over. Thanks for reading."
1,"Out of print, and for a good reason!","This is a stupid cartoon which I always hated. It's one of the ridiculous Pink Panther cartoons. Um, hello, but it's 2006, and in this day in age NOBODY watches this. If they did, why is this out of print? See any Taratino movie instead, please."
2,broke during assembly,I wanted this for some stock photography. The parts are tiny and hard to discern which goes where and several parts broke during assembly. I gave up and moved on.
4,Very Helpful for Beginner,My wife had not taken ballet since she was a young girl and wanted to informally see how much she remembered and to gauge what she could still do physically. This was one of several books and DVDs I bought for her but she felt it was by far the most useful. She has been using the DVD to exercise with and now is considering taking a ballet danced class.
4,Does almost everything I want except....,"This has really been a good system for me overall with a few minor complaints.On the upside:-- Call quality and handset range is good, no interference or static from Wifi stuff in the house.-- Speakerphone on the base and the handsets works really well. The sound is loud and most folks can hear me just fine.-- Battery life in the handsets is really good, especially taxing it using the speakerphone a lot.-- Handsets are comfortable and easy to hold (good form factor)On the downside:-- Caller ID. Storing or redialing numbers from the caller ID list is almost useless because the 10 digit number is what is displayed and stored. If you want to call outside your home area code you need to find a means of sticking a 1 in front of the number, which is cumbersome at best.-- Buttons on the base are a little small for dialing.-- There is no slot in the base for a backup battery in case the power goes out."
2,NICE PHONE TO LOOK AT.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS A NICE PHONE TO LOOK AT AND IS SIMILAR TO THE 8885, BUT THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENCES.. ALSO AFTER APPROX. A WEEK THE PHONE WOULDN'T WORK AT ALL. SO THE SELLER WAS CONTACTED AND THE PHONE WAS RETURNED.."
1,Don't believe description!!!!,The description says that this item includes an extra handset and charger. It didn't come with one. When I contacted customer service I was told that it was a misunderstanding on MY PART!!!!I have tried to escallate the issue and have not received a response. I will update if they ever decide to contact me.
5,HANDEL WITH PLEASURE,"First a word of caution. My own copy of this is part of the London Weekend edition. The recordings date back to the mid to late 70's. This is not DDD. That being said, I have not heard a better sounding version of THE WATER MUSIC. It is elegant, majestic, reverent and immensely pleasing. Szell delivers Handel with pleasure. The Royal Fireworks are also very well done. Bravo London and Szell. 10/10."
4,Very Good,"The Worms 3D game was one of the best games ive played in a while. I have been a big fan of the ""Worms"" games and was dissapointed by Worms Blast. But this game takes the original Worms and gives it a whole new spin. But the only big thing that is a problem, is that you will have some trouble trying to aim. With it now in 3D you'll need to learn how to aim with large objects in your way."
5,Fun Game,Works great and makes me laugh when I play it. My 11-year-old loves to play this too. So what does it say about a person who likes to play a game based on worms trying to blow each other up?
4,trailz,"Received bike and found a mostly completed bike kit. Frame is chinese manufacture.The finish is good, but is not up to 300 dollar brand name bike level. The electic component intergration is laid out well except for power meter controller is in vunerable position and seems cheap compared to rest of the bike's electrical parts . Nice automatic charger design. It is of aluminum construction, and took only 2 hrs to charge ,and nothing got hot. The bike assist you, but does not propel you without your help . Still it does not take much to get moving and the learning curve to operate is much less than a throttle type ebike . The disk brakes ,for those of us who haven't had them before ,work great and are quiet . I am sure I will enjoy having the bike down the road, but the cost ,along with the average quality fit and finish , bugs me a bit."
4,Nice Matts,"Matts just as described, nice fit, nice thickness, nice everything, fit my BMW 325i just perfectly, will buy again, thank you very much!"
2,"it was okay.not what i expected. a ""B"" flick for sure.","i purchased this because of sam trammel from the true blood series. this 3 pack movie set is totally a ""b"" rating at its best if it weren't for sam i wouldn't have wasted my money!!"
1,This one really stunk,The idea of the Rex movie was a good concept but mismanaged all to hell and back. The acting was poor and I understand the actors were ashamed but my god they could have tried. The science was weak. If someone with imagination and talent had written the screenplay then actors could have let their talent soar.
4,Good read.,"Kept me reading until the end. I've been enjoying the series. Entertaining. Not deep or life changing, but i didn't expect it to be."
4,the 5th horseman,Love reading James Patterson's books. Always he intrigues the readers that they cannot put the book down. The Fifth Horseman does the same. I love the twists he produces and the reader feels for our heroines.
1,"Unfortunately, this was expected and....","I can now say I am thoroughly finished with James Patterson...I gave up Alex Cross in the middle of the awful writing of London Bridge, didn't look back and now find I am in the exact same position with the Women's Club. DONE with Patterson forever.Cannot understand how the publisher excepts these horrible excuses for books and the public, hopefully will catch up to those of us who are so disappointed..My solace is that there are SO many other terrific writers out there so my recommendations are: Lee Child, Harlan CobenGwen Hunter, Illona Haus, Paul Levine, Tina Wainscott,Christiane Heggan, G. H. Ephron....and I could still keep on going, but I know you'll all find them the way I did....Have fun hunting around for the BEST...don't settle"
3,Not Up To Par,After having enjoyed the first four books in this series I was totally disappointed in this book. It was disjointed and it read like a book written by two people who did not talk to each other until near the end. We have two distinct stories (mysteries) taking place in the first two thirds of the book and they are not related in any fashion. One of the mysteries ends and we then move on to the next one which has been around since the beginning of the book. The end of this mystery concludes on two pages with nothing leading up to it. In the meantime an improbable story concerning a doctor and a lawyer takes most of the focus and the reader is asked to believe that a wealthy lawyer and a well to do doctor are going to risk all for a relatively small amount of money. If you must read it check your brain on page one and don't say you weren't warned.
1,Writing exercise???,"This was the most disappointing book by JP that I've read, and I've read most of them. I found myself wondering if this was a collaboration by the 2 authors where one would write one chapter, and the other the next. There are 333 pages in the book and 139 chapters.Many chapters were less than 1 page in length. Chapter 43 (less than 1/2 page long) ends with ""It was Joe"", Chapter 44 starts with ""Joe's arms were full of..."".I found myself more concerned with whether this was something the author's were doing for their own entertainment than for mine. It was more a string of events than a story. The book would state something like 'she felt terrified' rather than making me, the reader, empathize with the character and feel her being terrified.If this was a students exercise it would be graded 'D' as a professional author's effort it warrants an 'F'"
1,I'm finished with this series,"I watched the series on TV and really enjoyed it. I found the books and started reading them in order. I'm just glad I didn't download the whole series. The first three books were GREAT! It had great characters, a great storyline, suspense and left me wanting more. When I read the 4th one, I felt like it wasn't as good, but because I loved the characters from the first three books, I thought, certainly the next one would be better and read it. Well, I was wrong! This one is worse yet. The characters are not developed at all. The ""club"" isn't really together in this one (or #4). I finished the book only because I thought it would get better, but it didn't.I'm done reading this series. I might be tempted to read more if Maxine Paetro is not involved. I can't believe that the great writer, James Patterson, of the original book would allow these books to be put out under his name."
2,Poor Research,Unfortunatley the content related to the hospital murders was not researched. It was distracting. Linda
2,This serie is getting worse each book...,"I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! What's the plot ? There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time !"
2,Stinko,"I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent. This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading. The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful. I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed. I ask you how many women do you know that use a term like ""skirt hound"" for a man who chases women? I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me! It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue. Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one."
2,Nothing new,"If you like Patterson and dont mind that nothing particularly new is added, you will like this book also. It follows the well know pattern and is for sure good entertainment. It's just that all his books by now seems to be so similar that they are becoming difficult to distinguish from eachother, and as readers we should expect more.I will likely keep reading his books, but as a writer, Patterson has dropped significantly in my ranking."
2,More Patterson fluff,"When I first started reading Patterson's novels some years ago, I enjoyed them very much. But since he's turned into a book production machine I can't say the same. The 5th Horseman has some ingredients for a good novel but it is so hastily put together that it ends up as fluff. Save your dollars and spend them on an author who puts time and thought into his/her novels rather than chasing the almighty buck at an ever-increasing frantic pace."
4,A Really Pacy Novel,"It may be a little known fact, but James Patterson has written more best selling titles in the past five years than Dan Brown, J.K. Rowling, Tom Clancy and John Grisham put together. He is one of a handful of authors whose sales have been growing over the past two years, even though best selling fiction sales in general have been declining.A young mother is recuperating in hospital when she is suddenly gasping for breath. The emergency call button fails to bring any help in time. The doctor's in the hospital, some of the finest in the US are completely mystified by the young woman's death, for no apparent medical reason. What happened?This is not the first time such an occurrence has happened at this particular hospital. Patients are well on the road to a clean bill of health and suddenly their condition worsen and they die. Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer probes deeper into the cases. Could they just be a coincidence or is some maniac playing with people's lives?"
4,Action-packed narrative with many twists and turns,"I like reading this series about the Women's Murder Club. I think Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is the strongest character and she holds the narrative together. Cindy and Claire are strong secondary characters. Yuki Castellano, a lawyer, is the newest member of their group. Her mother is admitted to Municipal Hospital as a patient. Yuki is irrevocably changed by what happens. Lindsay is leading her department to track down a murderer who leaves their victims in expensive cars with equally expensive clothes on. Claire is the medical examiner who does the autopsies on the victims. Cindy as a reporter is writing an article on the headline case against Municipal Hospital and Dr. Dennis Garza. It was an obvious plug for a new character in the very last chapter for the next installment. Overall this was an exciting and appealing murder mystery."
3,"With all the product placements, the book should be free","As I was writing this review of ""Fifth Horseman"", a glob of my Hellmann's (R) sandwich fell and glanced off my Dockers (R) and landed on the new Nikes (R) I just bought at Nordstroms (R). Good thing it didn't land on my HP (R) and ruin it or I might gone on an Anchor Steam (R) bender. Instead, I'll stick to Evian (R) and write this review... if only my Nortel (R) would just stop ringing!"
5,The 5th Horseman,"I have read all 5 of the Womens's Murder Club series and look forward to another. If you like to read about successful women, this series is for you. They are fun to read and very exciting. Happy reading."
2,Is he even writing anymore????,"After reading his last few book with ""co-authors"" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the ""co-author"". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves."
3,typical and what you have come to expect from james patterson...,"i think i had a better ending in mind, but a quick and easy read, also a great listen in the car....easy to follow....."
2,Disappointed but not giving up,"The 5th book in the Women's Murder Club is probably the worst James Patterson book I've read so far...other than those flying kids. The first book in this series got me hooked on Patterson, and I will continue to read his books, but this book left me disappointed and confused. I kept waiting for something to tie in the two storylines, but that never happened. The book ended, and I felt like...""this is it???"" Too many things left unexplained and unanswered. The sixth installment of this series will have a lot of making up to do."
2,Falls Short,"I am a big James Patterson fan. However, The Fifth Horseman is by far his most disappointing. There seemed to be two different stories (neither of which was quite concluded). Also, in the women's murder club series there is usually a lot more team work and interaction. Written by two - seems like it was written by about 20 students taking their first creative writing class."
2,5th Horseman,"First of all, let me just say that I am a big fan of the Women's Murder Club Series. That being said, this book just did not measure up to my expectations. The Car Girl murders and the hospital murders did not have anything remotely to do with each other, and therefore felt completely random. Also, the book did not have an exciting or gripping conclusion, it just sort of ended. Also, how does a person manage to get a syringe on an airplane with post 9/11 security? I really loved 1st to Die and 2nd Chance, and the two following those were decent though not as good, and this one just plain stunk. I really hope the next one impresses me or I may have to give up on this series."
2,So Bad,I have not read James Patterson for several years but I remembered him to be a much better storyteller that this soap opera piece. Between the police murder mystery you have to listen to this female love life prattle that really adds nothing but length to the story. So bad at about my fourth CD I finally skipped to the last CD to conclude my vexation.
5,Wild Ending,The last one hundred pages were wild & action packed. A lot of unexpected twists right down to the very last page. Next time I am feeling ill I will just take an aspirin!
2,The 5th Horseman,"The book moves along at the usual Patterson fast pace, but it was disappointing at the end. The ending lacked surprise, thrill and tension that hallmark many of his previous novels. Throughout the story there was a general lack of pizzaz."
2,Very disappointed,"I simply can't understand anyone giving this book FIVE stars!! It had three different crime plots and none of them were explained to me WHY the killer did it!!!! I thought I was reading three different books. Mr. Patterson is not being fair to his readers. I have purchased nearly every Patterson novel. I will not purchase anymore of the womens murder club series - frankly I think they are too ""hoakey"" or perhaps I am too mature."
1,PU,"He's churning them out way too fast. This one has high school dialog, is loaded with cliches, and has a plot that has been done a thousand times before. I'm sticking with the Alex Cross series and checking my pre-publication orders to make sure that nothing else coming this year from the Women's Murder Club"
3,"It's Okay, if you are bored.",I wouldn't really recommend this one. It's hard to beat Judge and Jury.
4,Pretty good,"I agree with one of the posters who said they felt like they were reading the same story over and over. While I enjoyed this book it seemed very predictable.Maybe I'm just tired of the Women's Murder Club or maybe it's my fear of hospitals! Anyway, I still love Patterson's books and will look forward to the next one."
2,Unrealistic,"I felt the story was very unrealistic, especially when it comes to the medical part. A hospital would have launched some formal investigation on these suspicious deaths. Nobody is admitted with broken bones unless some severe trauma and I have never heard of a Chemo drug ""accidently"" given instead of a percocet."
1,The 5th Horseman,It is difficult for me to review this product because on the last disk I was unable to hear the end of the book because of damage to the CD - The packaging holding the CD's was smashed down a bit when I received it but I did not notice until I listened to the last CD that there was an impression on it from the CD next to it in the package that messed up the disk.
2,"Patterson's Plotting's Better than His Writing, and That's Only So-so","This book has so many holes, you could utilize it as a sieve when you're through reading it. Especially its ending. Yes, the book's main plot is clumsily resolved in its epilog, which clearly comes through as an afterthought. When you do learn who the main killer is, the rest of the other characters' actions beforehand do not make much sense.Yet I did keep reading on and on, only to be furious at the time I wasted doing so. Doesn't Patterson have an editor who will tell him, ""You've almost got it right""?"
4,A Big Improvement on Step on a Crack,"I decided to give James patterson one more chance after the abysmal effort of Step on a Crack.The women's murder club series has been a series I really enjoy. I enjoyed this book. It was fast paced however still lacked substance. The characters could have been developed better - apart from the main character, Lindsay Boxer, the other main players were left on the sidelines. I found the book a bit disjointed in that it jumped around a bit. I really feel James Patterson needs to concentrate on quality rather than quantity. It would be a shame for his credibility as a writer to be compromised because he churns out 6 books a year. Also I feel cheated in that the paragraphs are so short and there is a lot of empty page space."
3,"Entertaining read, but has some flaws","Police Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is caught up in two sets of serial murders in the 5th. book of the Women's Murder Club Mysteries. In the first, young women are murdered, dressed in expensive clothes, and placed in luxury cars. In the second, patients in a local hospital seem to be doing well, and then they die mysteriously from medicine which is wrongly administered. The second case results in a courtroom battle which produces some of the best action in the book. Although the pages turn quickly and the action is sustained, there are some flaws in this book. First of all, when the perpetrators are identified, there is very little explanation as to their motivation for committing the crimes in the way that they did. There are a few threads left hanging, especially at the end which comes abruptly and without explanation as to how the murderer was apprehended and how the hospital computer system was entered in order to commit the crime."
2,Tripping over clichés and mistakes at every turn.,"I anticipated another great Patterson story on audiobook as I popped the CDs into the car changer. It only took the first CD to tell something was wrong. What a disappointing book. I almost didn't finish the book, but did finally finish listening with painful groans. My wife started listening to it with me, but ultimately abandoned listening before the end--it was too frustrating. The storyline is packed with fluff. The medical mischaracterizations and outright mistakes are criminal. I doubt James Patterson even read the entire manuscript before it went to the publisher. Otherwise he would have demanded corrections of multiple factual mistakes, would have seen to it that dead-end branchings of the storyline were complete and removed the fluff."
2,Confused and Disappointed,"I've been reading Patterson books for a while now and have found most of them pretty good and recommendable, but this one really falls short. I was expecting for the Lindsay and Joe story to expand a little more and was also looking forward to hearing more from my favorite character, Claire.There are 2 cases in this story and Patterson seemed to explain more about the less interesting one. And the ending? I just don't get. Another thing I didn't like about this book was that the title was awful. He just made a quick reference to it, just to get it out there. That was pretty funny actually.It was a quick read because the font was huge and the chapters start in the middle of the page. It really wasn't worth the money."
4,Another Great Book,This wasn't the best of the series but still a good read. Of course it leaves you hanging #6.
2,Two Bad Books in One!!,This was essentially two books crammed into one with neither being fully developed or resolved. I gave this book two stars just because it was kind of interesting and held my attention to the end...where I was expecting the two stories to be tied together or somewhat related. That never happened. This was probably the worst James Patterson book I've read. Don't waste your money if you are expecting a complete book. You only get half of two books.
3,Good but ....???,"The book came in good clean condition, however it did not have a dust cover and was a smaller size then expected."
4,5th Horseman - A Definate Read!!!,"I loved all the interaction with the characters in this book. I really found myself involved the moment I started reading it and then when I hit the middle it was like coasting downhill the rest of the way. The book was a quick read for me and I'm happy to say that again Mr. Patterson you didn't disappoint. The plot was great, the climatic ending was just in Patterson's style. I only had one question though when I was through with the book, what's going to happen with Lindsay and Joe??? Maybe I'll find out when I hop into the 6th book. I loved the edition of Yuki to the group. This is turning out to be a superb series!"
2,5th horseman,This book was a bit worn but readable. I was happy to read it. And neither disappointed nor pleased on the books physical appearance.
5,great book,I loved it. I couldn't put it down. Great mix of mystery and romance. Can't wait to see what happens next in the series.
4,Well developed and a page turner,I enjoyed the two story lines developing in this fast-paced story. Lots of people to want to see win and not always being gratified by this wish. Characters seem real and likable enough to want to meet them in person. Not able to put book down until I finished it.
1,Do not buy this book,Try another Patterson book but don't buy this one. The two plots are unrelated and end abruptly with some of the most unsatisfying conclusions I have ever encountered. The book contains a lot of filler with numerous chapters adding nothing to the plot. Do not buy this book. Awful.
1,No depth,"Although I orinally liked Patterson and have read all or most of his books, he is now obviously writing for quick money. There is no depth or character development in this one. I have purchased my last Patterson."
5,This is another great mystery! (Dont listen to the negative reviews!),"James Patterson is my favorite author, and I am amazed at the quality of his books especially when you consider the amount of books he has written. The 5th Horseman is no exception! It is another griping thriller staring my favorite crime fighter Police Detective Lindsay Boxer and her pals in the Womans Murder Club. I think this book is the best in the series! So don't listen to the negative reviews (I suspect they are all frustrated writers envious of Mr. Patterson's talent?).This was my first review, how did I do?"
2,Glaring lack of medical knowledge,"I have enjoyed so many of his books, but I had a difficult time concentrating on the story line with so many mistakes regarding hospital protocol and medical practice. If he is going to write a book regarding medicine again, I would suggest he hire someone knowledgeable in the subject to review and edit before it goes to print. The glaring mistakes made the entire book unbelievable."
4,Don't Think too Deep,"I really enjoyed this book but a day or so after I thought back to all the things that were not really tied up. Some reveiwers speak to them here -- about two stories really being told which is fine but I remember reading in the book that the first story line was solved and I was thinking... ""it was?"" oh yeah... but it was glanced over in such short time that I almost forgot that this is a story line that was tied up.I'm glad the author did not try to wind the two together in some outrageous fashion as other authors have been known to do.Overall a very quick read -- just go along for the ride and don't think to deep about it."
1,So Sad,I have read most of James Patterson's works including all of the women's murder club books. I just couldn't finish this. Ever since Mr. Patterson's books have been put out in assembly line fashion they have been at best of journeyman quality. It is hard to believe that these later books were written (or supervised) by the same man who wrote the truly excellent early Alex Cross novels.
2,Disappointed,"The pacing is uneven. I'm sorry to say that the reliance on co-authors to do so much of the work for Patterson is causing his books to suffer.Although I appreciate the use of San Francisco for the locale, the geographic inaccuracies are jarring. Frankly, the research is sloppy and I wonder if the co-authors have even been to San Francisco. Lindsay Boxer meets Yuko and Keiko in front of Union Square, but by no means is this ""out by the Golden Gate Panhandle."" In another section, the Hotel Triton can't be fronting Union Square steps away from the cable car line and also be across the street from Chinatown. Sloppy, very sloppy. Reading this is like watching Dustin Hoffman drive on the Bay Bridge the wrong way in The Graduate on his way to Berkeley."
3,Minimalist Reading,"Although I still love the character of Lindsay Boxer, this series in running on fumes.This is the weakest in the ""Women's Murder Club"" series by James Patterson and Maxine Paetro. The problem this time around is the minimalist writing style has gone over the top. There is virtually no detail of time or place. It's more like reading a movie script than a novel.The story has two interesting independent plots involving the serial killings of hospital patients and young women working as escorts. Neither plot is connected and are solved by simple mistakes by the perps. Mistakes that would be red herrings in better written novels. Newcomer Yuki Castellano gets a lot of ink but disapears near the end. The rest of the regular characters make frequent appearances, but contribute little to the plot. The only real winner in this is Lindsay's former partner, Jacobi, who really comes to life in this book. Bottom line: Wait for the paperback."
4,What Can I Say? I Love the Women's Murder Club!,"Lieutenant Lindsey Boxer and friends are back in a great thrill ride with The 5th Horseman and, while this novel contains two different serial killer plots that keep one guessing, one ends all too disappointingly fast while the other takes a strange turn with the murderer that makes you wonder why that character only came up very close to the end. It felt a bit like a rush job in each case to wrap both of the mysteries up, but I still gave it 4 stars for never being boring. A fun and gripping read, there are worse Patterson books out there, so I will go against the general reviewer grain and say I liked it. One gripe I have with JP is this, however: why kill off a cute and likeable character like Yuki's mother Keiko?"
2,"Fast-Paced, With a Twist","Fast-paced, fast-read, there are actually 2-1/2 mysteries with unexpected endings. A book to bring on the plane."
1,Horrible...,"I believe that James Patterson, with his reputation, could write directions in Chinese on how to use a can opener and it would most likely be a bestseller. I believe that because this book, as horrible as it is, is #5 on the New York Times Bestseller List as of the date I write this review. Unbelievable!THE 5TH HORSEMAN is truly one of the most pitiful excuses of writing I've ever read. This is a book for people who do not want to take any chances with the books they read, or challenge themselves in any way. As far as the story itself, it actually could have been interesting had there been any more thought or detail put into it. Unfortunately, those one page chapters seemed to interrupt the flow a bit.I can't recommend this book at all, and I'll be reluctant to read any future books by this author and his associates."
4,Sometimes a Bad Wind Blows,"Once again if you're looking for a quick read and one that won't let up, James Patterson comes through again. He minces no words and keeps you glued to the pages. This Women's Murder Club novel was on par with his previous ones. Both endings (to the separate plots) did seem to be abrupt, but I still enjoyed the ride.Recommended for Patterson fans."
4,"interesting, quick read","This is the first novel by James Patterson that I have read, after hearing his works praised by multiple friends. I found the novel to do what fiction should - provides an escape from your life and plants you into the life of another. Here, you're given a birds-eye view of San Fran detective, Lindsay Boxer, on her way to busting vicious killers. The book was an interesting, quick read - a good book to pick up for a road trip or an evening at home. I recommend it, and look forward to reading other novels by this author."
2,Patterson's ghostwriter needs to step it up,"I found this volume of the Women's Murder Club. The story contained two completely unrelated mysteries, the first of which was solved with little circumstance or explanation about 3/4 of the way through. The second mystery was solved in the last chapter with very little explanation. I was quite disappointed with the whole thing."
3,Not Really Patterson,"I love Patterson, but this book left me pretty cold. I don't know if the co-author wrote most of this or what, but I was not terribly impressed with the story or the writing. Just my personal opinion; I loved books one and two.Sharon Schultz"
1,sloppy story and crummy character development,"Terrible story. I really wish I could get my time and money back. There are two crimes that need solving at the same time...turns out they are totally unrelated. Seems like the two crimes were written in the same book just to fill pages. The ending of the first crime happened so quick and uninterestingly. The crime with Dr. Garza was so predictable but yet it was so poorly explained. Ultimately the ""major"" crime is solved with absolutely ZERO detail. The police just ""get"" the bad guy...the end. Its the sloppiest and most incomplete ending I can ever remember reading. The book is not worth your time or money. If you do read it...I predict you'll be disappointed with the whole story, especially the ending. But once it ends you'll just be glad its over and you can move on to a new author."
3,Not on par with the 4th of July,"This is definitely not a bad book, but it's certainly not one that will stay with you for very long after you read it. Why do suspects always have to crumble like sand castles when someone puts the heat on them? Lindsay's love affair with an on-the-go guy who only shows up briefly in her life when he wants to pound the pavement really does little to advance the story. He's supposed to be this awesome guy, but he's never really there when Lindsay needs him. Her relationships with Claire (medical examiner) and Cindy (news reporter) really take a nose-dive in this novel as well. For me, this was the first of the Women's Murder Club novels that was somewhat hard to get through. This novel is not a bad effort, but it kind of left me with the same type feeling I had in college when I got a test back with a C+ on it."
1,Horrid Book,"I made myself finish this book-as punishment. Bad writing, one-dimensional characters, chapters that are about 23 words long. Never again!!!"
1,"Get Another Narrator, Please!","I'm listening to the abridged audio version of this and my biggest comment so far is the narration is HORRIBLE. I have listened to earlier WMC books and hoped they would not use Carolyn McCormick again, but alas, she seems to have a deal with the publisher or something. Her delivery is hamfisted, her inflection is continually wrong, her pronunciation borders on cringe-worthy, and her differentiation of characters (with regard to voice tone) is comical when it isn't entirely lacking. So it's hard to follow who is saying what when you don't have the visual cues you get in books. I like the idea of Lindsey Boxer but this reader does not bring to life the character the authors have created. Save yourself the annoyance and read the book instead of listening to it."
4,Reading with Tequila,"I love the interaction between the four women in the Women's Murder Club mysteries and James Patterson's short chapters always make for a fast read. The dual mysteries in the 5th Horseman are interesting but a little light on suspense. There were some surprises and some very emotional moments. No where near as thrilling as some of the previous books Women's Murder Club books, but still very enjoyable and a good addition to the series."
3,Review,A little bit all over the place but overall I enjoyed this book. The women's murder club has done it again
3,Good series,I like the women's murder club series. I haven't been reading them in order but that doesn't seem to be necessary. This book was gripping from the beginning and very good but not my favorite.
2,books,this book was only in fair condition but is very good and i am half way through this book. this has been the best series i've read in a long time. so glad my son got me started on book one.
3,Angel of Mercy or Death?,"The 5th Horseman by James Patterson was not as good as the other Womens Murder Club books. Girls were being killed and then dressed up and left in cars. The clothes were very expensive clothes and the cars were always public places including a car show.While this is going on in a very large metropolitan hospital people are dying. People that should not be dying. People that are brought in for a broken leg for example.It seemed that an ""Angel of Death"" was on the loose at the hospital and the person that everyone was positive was doing it was a well respected Doctor.The book was a fast and easy read as all Patterson's books are but I was so disappointed at the end because the guily one was a nobody in the book that was doing the hospital killings.The people who were responsible for the ""Car Girl Murders"" were a shock but as a total I was somewhat disappointed in the book."
1,terrible,I want to say a few things about this book. First off Patterson needs to stop writing with Maxine Paetro. They are terrible together. This book was as bad as his last one he wrote with her. The book jumps around and there never really is character development. So in closing I thought the book sucked. Hopefully he will write the next one by himself or with someone else.
4,Didn't disappoint me,I enjoy the Women's Murder Club series of books. This is one of the more enjoyable books. There are enough little twists in the plot to keep your interest until the end.
2,I found disappointment in a book that I wanted to love...,"I found disappointment in this book. I've loved all of the other 4 installments of the Women's Murder Club, but this one was flat. I found myself not really caring about the story line. It was all over the place and didn't really interest me. I think that part of what made the other books so good was that you cared about the characters and the friendships that each one had with the other. There is very little in this book that resembles the other 4. The end seems rushed as well, as if it could have been another 100 pages long, but the author decided that it was long enough and needed to end the story.It took me 3 months to read this book, while the others only took about 4 days. I hope that this is not a trend in James Patterson's books. I've enjoyed most others that I've read."
4,5th Horseman,"Excellent condition for a used book, and the delivery very speedy. I am very pleased with my purchase."
3,Did I miss something?,"After finishing this book, I scratched my head thinking that I must have missed something. The book centers around two plots: the car girls and the mysterious deaths at a hospital. I felt that the car girls mystery wasn't concluded. What exactly happened? And why did they kill those girls? I just didn't see the point of having that included in the storyline. I think just focusing on the hospital deaths would have made for a better story. I would also like to have each woman be the main character in a book so we can learn more about her character. I have to admit I was anxious to read this book only to be disappointed at the end."
4,"Krups 452-4C Pro Aroma 12 Plus 12-Cup Coffeemaker, Black","We are very happy with this coffeemaker. It makes great coffee and it is easy to clean. We are currently using the unbleached paper filters in ours. At first I thought it was a bit noisey. It has a faster brew time than our old coffeemaker, so setting the brew start time a little later worked for us."
3,Still working after 3 years,I've had mine for about 3 years now and it's still working well. I was definitely expecting something a lot more sturdy for the price. The cheap plastic body was a disappointment. The water level indicator on the front is a nice feature so you can precisely measure the amount of water in the machine. I also enjoy strong coffee so the 1-3 cup brew cycle is handy for that. If you have company you can switch it to the faster 4-12 cup cycle and it brews fast.
1,Terrible coffeepot,"First time i used it, it dripped all over the counter..tried again with same results, sent it back. I got a LEMON."
1,Krups model#452/310,"just purchased dec,7 used it first timeon the 9th and ifind it to be a peice of junk.getting the carafe propely set . cofee over flows on to the warming plate"
1,Be Careful of This One,"I just wrote up a return for this coffee maker after having received it less than a couple of hours ago. The unit is defective, it won't feed the water through to the carafe. I've been a Krups fan for many years and have owned several of their coffeemakers and when they work, they're excellent. This product ""appeared"" to me to be re-conditioned as the exterior had scratches which shouldn't be on a brand new product. If you do buy this product, I advise you to attend to it the first time you attempt to use it. Due to the defect, the water sits in the back of the unit and begins to boil, this caused a large portion of the water to spew out over the lid and could have been dangerous with the unit so close to an outlet."
3,White Apache book,"Pretty good book. Older style of western, not like some of the modern titles. This series is not a love story but, neither does it contain the detailed scenes of violence that some modern writers seem to believe we readers enjoy. These books are not on the same level with Louis Lamour or Giles Lutz but, they're pretty good for the type of westerns they are."
2,Nothing to gain...,"Despite the fact that this nearly broke up their marriage, this book is not what I hoped for when I picked it up and began reading. I missed the old Mrs Carter who had a wry story about her life on the campaign trail. I will never forget the many adventures that she detailed in ""First Lady from Plains"" which is a superior book in every way. The time she was trapped in bathroom stall and had to crawl out of it. Then there was the time when she had to cut her way out when trapped in a car by her seatbelt. Funny stuff and real human interest. If bizarre things can happen to the first lady of the land the can happen to anyone, can't they? The book I wanted to read was a kind of sequel to the masterful ""First Lady from Plains."" This clearly is not that book, though I hope Mrs. Carter will consider writing it one day real soon."
1,Garbage,"This ball is a waste of money. Low grade, not very durable, the smell was terrible for weeks and when inflated it wasn't even perfectly round.I don't know what else to say other than don't buy it."
2,Preliminary verdict,"Well got this fitness ball and first impression was ho-hum, I had my doubts. Of course it was red, not blue but this mattered little to me. Paid a little more for this ball than most others and expected a little quality. Irregularities in form (stretch marks and pock marks), ball is NOT round when inflated, so where do you take the 21"" measurement from? It could measure 21 inches in one diameter and 24 inches another. Also seems like it does not hold air all that well but perhaps still ""settling"". Based on first impressions I am rating this a..."
1,Trouble contacting this seller,"I had the same problem, only I was sent the wrong size. I have contacted them via email to see if I can exchange it, with no response whatsoever. I am very disappointed, and cannot use this large ball. I don't care about the color, I just want the right size!"
2,Not what I expected,"I chose this stability ball for use as an office chair based on the fact that my gym uses this brand and I was familiar with the quality. The quality of the ball was as expected but I was bothered by a few things:1. The ball comes with a pump but it took about 20 minutes of persistent pumping in order to fill it. I'd buy a more powerful pump before I buy another ball. Breaking a sweat at the office isn't comfortable.2. I'm a 5'11"" 145lb male so 65cm seemed like it would be a good size. However the ball was smaller than I expected it to be whether for use as an exercise ball or as an office chair. I wouldn't say my chair or desk heights are anything out of the ordinary.3. The picture provided on both Amazon and the SPRI website show the ball as being blue. I received a red ball and sure enough there was wording on the box that stated ""Ball color may vary""."
5,CJ Box is the best,I think that the CJ Box books rank with the best series. As good as Lee Childs and others. The books are exciting and informative about the western part of the country.
3,Trophy Hunt not the best of Joe Pickett series,"I'm working my way through the Joe Pickett series, having already read and loved all his stand alone novels. This one just wasn't as good. I didn't like it ending without having solved the main mystery that we followed throughout the entire book. oh well. I'm still going to read the rest of the series. I just hope I like them better than Trophy Hunt."
5,"Grisly, even gross, but definitely worth your while","Yeah, this does deal with an unpleasant subject, mutilations, but if you can avoid being turned off, you'll find this among the best that C.J. Box has written. There are touches of the paranormal here, and there also is very interesting background informaion on mineral rights. C.J. Box maintains his characterization and while there are good guys and there are bad guys depicted here, there are also some very human people who aren't quite good, but not quite bad either. If you're unfamiliar with Box and his lead character, do read OPEN SEASON, SAVAGE RUN, and WINTERKILL first. But if you're already familiar with the series, trust me that this one doesn't disappoint."
5,Trophy Hunt,I usually take 3 or 4 days to read one of his books. Now I have read all of them and am waiting for his new release. They have all been great!!
3,A Little Too Dry,"I won't review the plot here or try to capture it's essence. But I will mention a point I don't see touched on in the reviews that preceded this -- and that's how Pickett, in this story, seems like a ball bouncing around a pinball machine. He doesn't really seem to take control of the investigation. Yes, he's only on a task force and yes, he has ""issues"" with some of the other task force members -- but he never seems that concerned about the whole situation until things start really getting out of control at the end. The scene where he confronts a man who he thinks might be behind the weirdness is very touching and shows Pickett's terrific humanity but once the end came rolling around I felt a bit cheated. In the end, I wanted more effort and passion and outrage. This left me feeling just a bit dry ... not CJ's best. Readers who enjoy CJ Box, however, might also enjoy an outdoor adventure in a neighboring state:Antler Dust"
3,Not up to his previous writings,"C.J. Box's latest `Trophy Hunt"" is a disappointment in comparison to his first novels. The good news is that the character of Joe Pickett continues to grow but the bad news is that the plot and ending of the book are quite unbelievable. The first half of the book is relatively gripping with the discovery of mutilated animals and then suddenly, the discovery of the mutilated bodies of two local men.The second part of the books veers into Stephen King territory and it is a rare author who can emulate King convincingly. I found that even with that understanding the ending was way off in ""woo woo"" land as Pickett describes it.All in all, a disappointment from a writer who has delivered very engrossing books in the past. Hopefully, Box's next novel will live up to his original promise"
3,Hated the last 20 pages,"I really like this series. Box is a terrific and knowledgable writer. This novel is great until the last 20-30 pages. The author has the mystery all tied up--then he goes on and on, adding information the reader doesn't need and solving the mysteries I didn't need completed. It's as if he had a plot and ending in mind but the book finished--very well--but he kept going because he had more story which he told in the most boring method possible: narrative. This happened, then this happened, etc. If the beginning hadn't been so great, this would have been a 1-star review. If the novel had ended in the right place, it would have been a five."
2,Trophy Hunt,"I truly like the Pickett family and their interaction with local folks. Nate for me however is a stretch and seems to be made for TV. In this book, Nate's connection with the bear lacks depth and goes beyond the limit of the ""suspension of disbelief"". In some ways, Nate goes beyond the boundary set by Tomlinson, the funky, hippy, baseball playing, sidekick of Doc Ford in the Randy Wayne White mysteries. And the bear, falls well short of Shardik, the mystical bear, in Richard Adams second novel. I have read them in order thus far on my Kindle (thanks for having a Kindle edition) and will read on because I like the writing. Where can a reader find a protagonist of integrity, a husband and wife that love one another, children that are properly peculiar, and a pain-in-the-neck mother-in-law - where - in a C.J. Box novel. Buy one - just not this one. Hope the next book returns to the simple rules of its predecessors."
4,Needed more suspense.,"After Box's first three excellent books, I found this a bit lacking. It felt very slow at times and had a number of things left unexplained. I don't mind the element of mysticism but it didn't feel complete. Joe, his family and friends are great characters, the story definitely had me turning the pages and completing it in a day but it wasn't quite as strong as his previous books. Don't misunderstand; this is still a very good read and a series I shall continue to follow, but I hope the next entry will have a bit more suspense to it."
2,Trophy Silliness,"I was extremely disappointed by the last Pickett novel and hoped this one would return to the quality of the first two. The book opens with an intriguing mystery-the inexplicable mutilation of wild animals-followed by two horrific murders. Joe Pickett has found his moral compass again. The portraits of Joe and his family are superb. The first half of the book is a page turner. Then, the resolution.... The villains were ridiculous, the solution of the murders was extraordinarily contrived. High hopes for this outing--not fullfilled. I'll pass on Pickett five."
2,Trophy Hunt,In the words of the books hero and I quote What a bunch of who-who crap. This was a huge disappointment after reading the first three books of the series.
3,Too slow for some applications,If you do sports photography with something like a Canon EOS40D which can run off 256Mb of images in one burst of a few seconds you are going to be waiting for this card a lot longer than for other cards at the same price.At 45x this is just over 1/6th the speed of 266x cards which sell for a similar price. A pretty picture doesn't make up for a lack of speed.
4,No Big Deal,"This video was in good condition and was packaged well. I have been showing this video to my classes at school and it is quite cheesy. It does have a good message to be kind to those who are mean to you and to do what is right, even when you have an excuse to be mad."
5,CIRCUS OF HORRORS,"I love this movie, which is why I probably wound-up with several copies of it. It is an excellent movie with an unexpected twist at the end (you won't be able to guess at the ending). BEAUTIFUL EUROPEAN WOMEN in various states of undress, but still suitable for family viewing. The movie is in brilliant color. Recommend this movie to all horror/sci-fi/mystery fans."
2,I wonder why this exists as a show,The tale seems to be strengthless and meaningless and some main characters just don't know how to ACT and SING.A waste.
3,Dr. Hekyll,"While I am truly in love with the show, I believe that David Hasslehoff just wasn't cut out for the lead role. He is pretty solid as Edward Hyde, Jekyll's other half, but when it comes to Jekyll, pull out the ear plugs. All of the supporting leads, however, were amazing. And the rest of the cast really set the stage. I would say that the rest of the cast makes up for Hasslehoff's poor performance"
4,Try to ignore Hasslehoff,"With the exception of David Hasselhoff, the cast is amazing. Colleen Sexton is an incredible Lucy. I am a huge Christiane Noll fan and was initally disapointed that she wasn't on the DVD, but the woman playing Lisa...er I mean Emma does a fantastic job. If you only get it to see them perform ""In His Eyes"", it would be worthwhile."
2,Does not do justice to this musical,"I originally saw Jekyll & Hyde when it first was created here in Houston and have seen it live several times, before and after it went to Broadway and it is my all-time favorite musical, bar none.So, even though this production had none of the cast I had seen, I figured the musical was so awesome that it would be good regardless.Well, I was wrong. The songs I loved are there, but this cast doesn't begin to hold a candle to the ones I had seen live and David Hasselhoff is terrible. And the girl playing Lucy can't begin to hold a candle to Linda Eder, who I saw originally create the role. I could barely finish watching it.Don't waste your money. Instead buy the CD of the original cast and just imagine the visuals in your head."
2,better with a real singer,"David Hasselhoff was not the right man for this role. I saw this musical with it original cast (wich was very very very very good) and a local playhouse performed this musical (which was also very good). David Hasselhoff can not sing at the broadway level. he can sing pop, but not broadway. He was not able to hit all the notes and left me a little dissipointed about the play. The other actors make up for it. His acting was differnt, I thought it was really good. I gave the video a 2 because of Hasselhoff's not so great singing ability in this role."
1,a good chance missed,"I saw ""Jekyll & Hyde"" several times on Broadway with Linda Eder and Robert Cucciolli. Very enjoyable BUT it takes a fine actor who can pull off Jekyll / Hyde especially when he's having a ""converstaion"" with himself or, rather, the two personalities. Cucciolli was marvellous at this as well as being a fine singer. Hasselhoff has not one iota of talent so why he was filmed in this is beyond me. I recommend the show but not this travesty."
4,Jekyll and Hyde the Musical,"Something is definitly missing from this show. David Hasselhoff just doesnt seem to make ""Henry Jekyll"" happen!! He does make an alright ""Hyde"", though. Andrea Rivette (Emma Carew) has a very nice voice and fits to role of Emma perfectly. But Coleen Sexton just blew me away. She made up for what Hasselhoff lacked. Not only is Coleen Sexton very pretty, but she has an amazing voice. When I heard her sing ""A New Life"" and ""Someone Like You"", I fell in love with Jekyll and Hyde immediatly."
1,Give me Sebastian Bach!,"David Hasselhoff.... Oh my god... Could they have picked someone LESS talented to play Jekyll & Hyde?? David, your resume did not benefit from your performance.. ugh.. Someone I would have liked to see in this filmed version of the show would have been Sebastian Bach, a rocker from the early 90's, who took on the role on Broadway back in 1998 or so, and who, I've heard, did an amazing job. I love the entire cast featured on the Broadway cast version of the CD, mainly Linda Eder, who I love, but for something a bit different, instead of hearing Broadway trained actors playing Jekyll & Hyde (such as Anthony Warlow, Chuck Wagner and Bob Cuccioli), it would have been nice to hear someone who could really hit those high notes with some attitude! Anyway, just to warn those of you who are planning on purchasing this joke of a DVD, beware. You'd be better off renting it if anything else, and even then, you'll know why I'm giving it one star."
1,David Hasselhoff is LOUSY,"I can't believe anyone would defend the ""singing"" and ""acting"" ability of David Hasselhoff. Jekyll/Hyde is a very demanding role, one which can make or break a show. Well, this poor show was definitely broken by Mr. Hasselhoff. It's such a shame because the rest of the cast is good, but Mr. Hasselhoff's presence just ruins this show. He is so cheesy that he actually made me laugh. I've had the pre-Broadway concept CD for several years and saw the touring show with Linda Eder and Robert Cuccioli. I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, but was sorely disappointed. Do yourself a favor, buy one of the CDs with the money you'd waste on this."
1,So sad. Hasselhoff ruins the whole show!,"I've had the original Warlow/Eder CD's for some time and was thrilled when I found out I'd finally be able to see the show. It was horrible. I returned it immediately and am trying to forget I ever saw it. Hasselhoff is no match for Warlow. He's not even competent. He can't sing, and isn't even trying to act. If you're a fan of Hasselhoff, you ""might"" like it, but if you're a fan of ""Jekyll & Hyde,"" stay away!! This DVD will only upset you."
2,An incredible waste of a marvelous cast!,"The cast in this performance is remarkable, especially the women! David Hasselhoff does carry his role convincingly, and has a wonderful voice. The material is just terrible, however, and I don't even know how it lasted for the number of runs it did on Broadway. It took a lot of patience on my part to even finish the show. It didn't move me one bit. I just happen to collect musicals, and I thought that I had to have this. I don't regret owning it, though, but I definitely wouldn't recommend your buying it. It's a good example of a bad Broadway musical, and that's what it really is."
2,What a pity...,"Being a huge man of the musical, I didn't expect much out of David Hasselhoff or anything else about the movie. There's a concert CD out there with the voice of Colm Wilkinson as the title role. After you hear Colm Wilkinson (the original Jean Valjean in Les Mis) do some of these pieces (particularly Till You Came Into My Life), and hear Linda Eder's voice, your standard is raised and this DVD does not cut it."
2,So disappointed,"Living in Houston, I got to see the origins of this wonderful musical and have seen it three times during its two runs here, with Linda Eder both times.For years I have been wanting to see a video version released and was so excited when I saw this release.....that is, until I actually watched it.This production is incredibly disappointing when compared to some of the original productions, which had much better/stronger cast members. I understand this might have been a dream for Hasselhoff, but it was a bit of a nightmare for fans of this musical.Perhaps if you've never seen this musical at all, you might be able to able to appreciate this version on some level, but for fans of J&H overall, I think you will be equally disappointed with this version as I was."
3,Great Supporting Cast... but lacks a LEAD,"David Hasselholff is one of my favortie actors. I loved his work with Knight Rider and Baywatch. For years, he's been a pop-icon overseas and has always dreamed of being a Broadway performer. However, his voice is not very pleasing on one's ears from a musical perspective. Though his voice is large, it lacks the finesse and range of the lead in this musical. However, the supporting cast is superb!!! They make the DVD worth purchasing. The sound quality is also VERY good. For thos who are accustomed to hearing ANTHONY WARLOW or ROBERT CUCCIOLI as the leads, you'll be dissapointed with Hasselholff... but if you're a big fan of Jekyll and Hyde (as I am), I highly reccomend this DVD."
4,"Great show, bad example","I'm a huge musical fan and I must say that Jekyll and Hyde is absolutely one of my favorite shows.Before seeing Mr. Hasselhoff's version of the film I had seen Sebastian Bach live in the role of Jekyll and had also listened to Robert Cuccioli (my personal favorite) in the soundtrack extensively, and I have to say that of the three most famous men to play the role, Hasselhoff is not exactly my favorite.He simply does not do as well as the leading man of a Broadway show should. His vocals are mediocre at best, and pale in comparison to Bach and Cuccioli.His performance, however, is not to say by any means that this show or this film in specific is bad. It is not. The score is absolutely golden, and George Merrit (Utterson) and Coleen Sexton (Lucy) are superb. This show is truly awesome, but it is simply not the best example of the show I can name--it is just the only one on DVD."
2,great show but badly cast for video,"Having seen J&H 4 times on Broadway I was looking forward to having it on video to watch when I pleased. However, the joy quickly turned to disappointment with the cast that was used for the video/telecast. Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder were - in a word - superb. Ms Eder has the voice and presence the video lacks. Cuccioli is a splendid actor whose transformation of Jekyll to Hyde was thrilling and far beyond the ability of Mr. Baywatch. Cuccioli, with use of body language and voice, makes two different characters believeable. His dialog between Jekyll and Hyde near the end was remarkable. Not so the video.Stick with the Broadway recording and let's HOPE someone has the sense to film it with Eder and Cuccioli."
3,Whose Idea was it to cast David Hasselhoff??,"A beautiful show, vocally enthralling with such captivating characters... so why ruin it by casting David Hasselhoff? You can argue that everything about this musical is so well done, and I can agree to an extent but I am telling you not to buy this because Dave ruins the whole thing. David acts the show well enough but he can't sing a show that has been declared one of the most challanging. David does this thing when he sings the really strong parts of the show he tries a vibratto and it fails... miserablly. The show has so many good qualities, so if you know someone who has it borrow it, defineately not worth the money to buy. Something to say for the show, is that the women all rock. Lucy and Emma own their parts heart and soul! Choose with care."
2,"Please, Stop the Madness","I was very surprised to see that so many people enjoyed this version of Jekyll & Hyde, though I might ask why. David Hasselhoff is understandable (who gives this guy the idea that he can sing?) but the rest of this cast wasn't much better. Coleen Sexton's voice is extremely whiney and at times she looks like she's struggling to hit the high notes. Linda Eder did a much better job than she did and the role of Lucy is an alto role, not a soprano role. Andrea Rivette, I also didn't like much, she sounded like she was singing through her nose and her wig is just awful. Is Emma Always doomed to have terrible hair? On the plus side, she's better than Sexton. The rest of the cast isn't that great except for George Merritt and Barrie Ingham, they were just outstanding. If you want to hear them sing, buy the cd version of this where you'll hear much better singing and no Hasselhoff"
4,"Greatmusic, good show Worth seeing for Coleen Sexton","Although David Hasselhoff's acting can be laugh-out-loud funny a times, the show itself is pretty good. There are some incredible songs: Someone Like You, In His Eyes, A New Life. If I could only give you one reason to see this video, it's because of Coleen Sexton's unforgettable performance as Lucy Harris. She is one of the most talented people I've ever seen. She is way better than Linda Eder from the original cast. All of her songs are the high points in the show, the parts you won't want to stop watching. The rest of the show is alright. If you're into Broadway, I'd say this is worth seeing."
1,I have never been so horrified!!!,"I think it to be a most incredible CRIME that David ""Hasselputz"" was actually allowed onstage to completely destroy this amazing musical sensation.I felt an insuperable amount of sympathy for the talented actors on stage that had to work with him. I'm absolutely sure that these other actors were quietly biting their own tongues not to completely lose control of their own performance on stage.If you want to listen to a talented actor sing this role, look to Anthony Warlow in the concept album. This is shear brilliance and beauty in a rare male broadway voice. (though Anthony's voice shows clear operatic training)Buy the concept album but DON'T, for you own health, but this DVD. It's far too painful!!!!!"
2,A good example of the dangers of casting big names...,"Okay, so I admit I'd never heard of David Hasselhoff, but given the huge play he got (ie, name above the title), I knew he was supposed to be a big name, so I worried about how he would fair in a fairly vocally challenging role. I was right to have worried.Whoever cast him should be forced to listen to him trying to sing ""This is the moment,"" which USED to be one of my favorite songs.Oh, and the supporting cast is adequate if uninspired, the costuming is trite and boring, the camera work is tired, and I still like the original music better, you know, before they cut ""Bring on the men."" It might not have added anything to the story line, but it was a good song!Rent it if you must, but don't buy it. Send your money instead to my new favorite charity: Voice lessons for washed-up stars who want to be on Broadway."
1,AAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!!!,"jekyll and hyde isn't the greatest broadway show of all time, and sometimes gets consumed in its own weepy ballads. however, in saying this, i am happy to acknowledge that when done by a terrific cast, the musical truly becomes something above average and fairly decent. i'm talking from the experience of listening to bob cuccioli and linda eder: two terrific singers, especially the former. these are the kinds of people we need on the broadway stage: singers and actors of unbelievable power.but we got stuck with david hasselhoff. oh.my.god. i do believe other reviewers have put it better. robert cuccioli, for instance, pulled this show UP with is gorgeous voice. mr. h. pulls it down, and it becomes CRAP.save yourself.write a letter to frank wildhorn and ask him to film a version with cuccioli and eder, or even warlow and eder. and then proceed to kick hasselhoff in the nads for ruining an already shaky show."
3,david hassellhoff lacks vocal power!!!,"I bought the original soundtrack of Jekyll and Hyde before it was even brought to Broadway. The album featured Anthony Warlow in the title role together with Linda Eder. Both artist displayed superlative vocal prowess which made me look forward to seeing the play. I bought the DVD release recently and was quite disappointed. David H. might have the stage presence/star quality but he definitely lack the vocal ability to do justice to the songs, most especially ""this is the moment"". Even Mr. Hassellhoff's acting appeared weak. I thought I was watching ""Baywatch meets Jack the Ripper"""
1,The worst show ever?,"Heralding the oncoming death of artistic creation, Frank Wildhorn's three note melodies retain their power to shatter glass even in digital transfer. Everybody who was planning on kidnapping Andrew Lloyd Webber to prevent further atrocities against the human race can put a new number in their collective rolodex. To all who wish to purchase Jekyll & Hyde on DVD, a piece of advice: send me the money, and drink bleach instead (it's more entertaining)."
3,DEAR GOD,"I saw this musical when it came out on Broadway originally and was struck dumb by how incredible it was. Then, to see it on HBO with David Hasselhoff... I was horrified. First of all, the man can't act and who was drunk when they cast him?! He butchers an incredibly rich and emotional roll, a roll that needs a more accomplished actor who knows how deep Jekyll and Hyde's duel roll is. His jerky and bulging-eye crazy man act for the last scene of the battle of Jekyll and Hyde murders a wonderfully rich song...For anyone who wants to get to know this musical? Get the original cast recording. SKIP THIS DVD."
2,Sad production of a great show,"Having been fortunate enough to have seen the original cast on Broadway, this disc is fairly pathetic by comparison. It captures none of the excitement of the show and makes one constantly hit the fast forward button on the remote. David Hasselhoff's acting and singing talent is a far cry from Robert Cuccioli and Andrea Rivette is definitely NOT Linda Eder. Side by side comparisons of the music of the original cast recordings and the performances on this disc makes this rendition seem more like a badly done high school play than a Broadway hit captured for posterity. Too bad because when performed by the talented, it is an amazing 135 minutes of theater."
2,Stunt casting,"I won't go through a long treatise on the shortcomings of this version - other reviewers have done that quite well. I saw the show on tour, and was blown away. The lead on the tour was an actor named Chuck Wagner, who has a HUGE baritone voice.You can sample and buy his version of ""This is the Moment"" and several other songs from the show here:Chuck Wagner"
3,Good - but Hasselhoff?!,"David Hasselhoff's rendition of ""This is the Moment"" is probably the worst piece of music I have heard in my life.Someone shut him up. Please. Fast.Anyway, I hadn't seen the show, and the filming and editing gives you a good idea of what it must have been at the theatre...I guess.."
2,good show. bad actor,I really like the show and music....when done with actual musical theater actors. Putting Hoff in just to add a better known name was just a hail Mary to try to keep the show on Broadway. I saw it in 2000 on Broadway. DVD should have been made with less popular names who were much better singers and actors than Hoff.
2,Ugh....,"First I'm going to say I never saw or heard this musical before I saw it on DVD. I bought it because I've heard good things about the musical. BIG MISTAKE!!! I thought the music was good in most parts, but David Hasselhoff is just terrible. I can't believe that they cast him in the musical. Let alone make the video with him in it. It's the first time some people (like me) will hear it or see it.I'm not that sorry I own it, though, for two reasons: Coleen Sexton and Andrea Rivette. They have have amazing voices. Too bad that David has to come in and ruin most of their songs. The only two songs in here without him that are worth listening to are ""In His Eyes"" and ""A New Life."" Although now I like a lot of other songs from the musical, these are the only two I can stand on the DVD. Final note, those two actresses almost make up for the price of the DVD, but David Hasselhoff will gain no fans for the show."
2,The worst performer I have ever seen for Jekyll,"It is a little disappointing to verify that the DVD lacks many numbers. In addition, the main part is played by a bad actor and a worse singer. COME BACK CUCCIOLLI!!"
2,Why did Hasselhoff Get this Role?,"In case you haven't noticed a pattern in most of the other reviews, almost everyone hates Hasselhoff's portrayel of Jekyll and Hyde. This recording is worth something for the other actors and the technical aspects, but don't watch it and then believe you have seen a true performance of Jekyll and Hyde. Buy either the Concept Album or the Original Broadway Cast Album and hear what this show should really sound like. Even if I did not appreciate Hasselhoff's performances in Knight Rider and Baywatch, I could at least respect them. This was inexcusable."
2,"Ruined, I say, Ruined!","I bought the Jekyll and Hyde CD long before I saw the show. The original cast was outstanding, and I saw it two more times on Broadway. I also saw it on tour with Chuck Wagner in the lead role. It's not the best Broadway show ever, but it is good entertainment.But there's just no escaping the damage David Hasselhoff does to this piece of theater. He's horrid. Oh, his voice is passable, but his Jekyll never quite manages to shake that dear-in-the-headlights-with-the-makeup-of-a-ventriloquist's-dummy look. And his Hyde looks like he's doing a deranged Marty Feldman impersonation. ""This is the Moment"" is stripped of any value as he rushes through the lyrics and walks as though there's a foreign object in his trousers.The rest of the cast is stellar, which is the only reason this production deserves any stars at all. It's worth watching in a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" kind of way, but unless you're a BIG fan of Jekyll and Hyde, or of Baywatch, don't bother."
1,Why oh why did they choose this one to film?,"I saw this show on Broadway with Robert Cuccioli. I saw the pay-per-view version with David Hasselhoff. Two totally different shows. Hasselhoff is not equipped to carry off this role, although it seems that his bankroll is what brought him this far. Anyone who has seen this show with Cuccioli in the starring role knows that there is no comparison. Please tell me someone filmed the version with Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder in the leading roles. It's perfection."
4,In favour of Mr. Hasselhoff,"Having only seen the show in Germany, I was very curious about the Broadway production. The fact that they filmed the actual stage production thrilled me. When I heard who was playing the lead though, my jaw dropped in disbelieve. To my surprise, Mr. Hasselhoff did a fairly good job, especialy his Hyde is worth seeing. Sure, in some scenes, his voice doesn't live up to the ones of trained singers, but he does a good job nevertheless. He overacts sometimes, but that is something others do as well. The show itself has some very weak points itself, but the cast does the best within their limits. The DVD is worth having, both sound and picture quality are superb, and it's great to watch."
3,Buyer Beware,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. I saw the play on Broadway and absolutely loved it! I bought the DVD with some hesitation because I knew David Hasselhoff wouldn't do a very good job and I was right (I don't understand how he could be so popular overseas!). I suppose he should get a star for trying but his acting is pathetic and his singing is strained. The producers should be ashamed of themselves because if they had selected someone like Michael Ball or any of the wonderful actors from the Broadway performances (I can't remember the name of the performer from the CD but he was great), this DVD could have been amazing! The music and the rest of the cast are wonderful though. I suppose if you didn't get a chance to see the play on Broadway, then you won't be too disappointed."
4,HASSELHOFF TRIUMPHS IN JEKYLL AND HYDE,"I purchased the DVD because I had not originally seen this production. As his first Broadway appearance (and hopefully NOT his last), David Hasselhoff's performance is memorable. Although his voice seems slightly weak in the beginning, his acting more than compensates for any perceived vocal deficiency. This is not a production for the faint-hearted. Mr. Hasselhoff's Edward Hyde is, indeed, a sadistic creature who commits violent murders. The duet between Jekyll and Hyde is a daring idea, and Mr. Hasselhoff's rendition is brilliant and flawless -- a unique moment in theatre history not likely to be repeated or surpassed! The supporting cast is quite good, especially the four co-stars. The DVD bonus prelude provides an opportunity for Mr. Hasselhoff to share interesting behind-the scenes commentary about his role. This Jekyll and Hyde is a welcome addition to anyone's video collection. Vive La Hoff!!"
1,Don't buy it,"These chairs have no center of gravity. If your child sits on the edge, the chair flips out from under neither them. The chair flew out from under neith my 21 month old and he hit his head on it as he fell."
1,Horrible!,"The table is not flat so you cannot put anything on it without having it roll right off. It is not good for any sort of arts & crafts whatsoever and the chairs are useless! I ended up having to buy another table, there is a reason it is so cheap!"
1,Terrible,Out of the box we noticed the table top was warped. When you push on one side of it the other pops up. Definately not suitable for crafts or play. Returned it that night!
3,"My kids loved the table, but...","My kids loved this table set, but when we got it it was pretty beaten up. And had a big lump in the middle of the table. Im sure it was a manufacturer malfuntion, so I sent it back. But we will definatly get another one."
1,I don't understand it.,"First, Barker says that no one has the right to tell you what to think. Yet he goes into debates and publishes this book to influence people how to think. Then, he says (in terms of morality), that no one has the right to tell anybody what to do. Yet Barker judges God and Christians and others. Surely, you guys can see how he's contradicting himself, right?"
1,What a sad lost fool!,"This book is amazingly honest and forthright. It is rare to see someone so clearly display their self-righteous egocentric and bigoted views while trying to appear noble...This is truly a poor excuse for a theology, and someone who is afraid to deal with truth... I am only glad I consider myself agnostic so he cannot be grouped in with me.Wow..."
5,Excellent!,"Some of the same arguments I have been trying to deal with for the last 29 years. I was born into this world naturally and will go out of it naturally.Barker comprises his book with some of the newsletters that he has written in the years after his conversion to reality.The only thing that is wrong about some of his writings is that he uses the abreviations ""BC"" and ""AD""; which are used only by the uneducated christian who thinks that their ""savior"" was born in the year one - what happened to the year zero, where is the historical proof of his birth, etc....? The proper designations are C.E. and B.C.E.The book is a good reference style book. Very good book and open minded.I need to get one of his shirts ... because I am your ""happy neighborhood athiest"" also."
5,A very interesting another view of the Christianity,"This book simply put the Christianity and most theist arguments down. If you can forget the terrible threats of hell and sulfur lake of the ""lovely"" Christian God for those who doubt of bible and if you can keep your mind away from prejudices, you can seriously start to think of reviewing all your beliefs after reading this book. Of course if you can't even try to understand different thoughts of your own, your feelings won't be different of some reviews full of ""ad homimem"" arguments in this site.It's also interesting to check the many Barker's texts freely available on his site. His texts helped me very much in my hurting transition from modern Christianity to the freethought.In time: I'm agnostic."
3,"Well, worth the read.","I think Christians will be challenged if they read this book. But, as far as the Bible controversy goes, I think they have answers and responses to them. I recommend you guys get Strobel's THE CASE FOR CHRIST. As for the Bible verses get Geisler's WHEN CRITICS ASK. Or visit the tektoniks website. Aside note: Scholars (both liberal and conservative) concede that a Jesus really did exist. I think it's peculiar that Barker thought that Jesus was just a mental concoction and never existed!But, all in all, Barker really isn't fair. My philosophy teacher recommended a debate he had with Michael Butler. Butler exposes how much faith Barker has in his worldview. For instance, Barker actually believes that induction is futile and unjustifiable in an atheistic worldview!"
4,Dan Barker,"As a Pastor Dan Barkers book was indeed very interesting. Unfortunately it does not hold water in several areas and arguments. Anybody with more interest in this topic and an intelligent response should see or listen Dan Barkers debate with Dr. Robert Morey a christian apologist. It was quite embarrassing for Mr. Barker I am afraid. It is one thing to write a book, quite another to have to defend it."
1,Very Boring,Dan Baker's book is boring in everyway. All the arguements he uses to refute Christianity have been articulated better by better atheists and agnostics. Baker essentially misunderstands Christianity and is therefore a poor critic. What Baker needs is a library card so he can read what some truly thoughtful atheists have had to criticize in Christianity. This book will be a waste of time for deep-thinking atheists and a hindrance to amatures. His style is droning. He over-simplifies everything showing no apptitude for understanding the complexity of the issue. The general mood is of a teenage boy who revels in talking bad about his dad. Atheism used to have more dignity. Humanism used to show more restraint and compassion.
1,I'm surprised...,"...anybody can support Dan Barker who believes that the laws of induction don't exist; that if people didn't exist, laws wouldn't exist; that putting the Bible in context isn't important. What makes people support Barker who believes in such nonsence? If you're interested, Michael Butler demolishes Dan Barker in a debate you should make an effort to get. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Christian (I'm agnostic), but I think you should be fair in assessing Christian theism...Barker isn't."
5,Excellent criticisms of ludiricious assumptions,"Dan Barker's ""LFIF' is an excllent criticism of the bible and christian dogma and another example of why reason and logic will always win out in the end. I especially enjoyed his sections on morality (or lack theirof)in the christian bible, and I especially enjoyed his section on the histriocity of Jesus. I never even considered the fact that Jesus Christ never existed but after reviewing the material, I now consider just to be a myth. I recommend this book to anyone who thinks their ""faith"" means something."
5,My Bible,"Thank you, Dan Barker, for producing this well-written book that addresses many of my thoughts. If you are an atheist, contemplate religion, or just up for new insight, you will love this book! I have made this my ""Atheist Bible""."
4,A worthwhile read,"I like the way the author has thought through religious concepts to show the absurdity of faith,which I beleive is human hope and nothing more.This book is very 80's in it's conceptual style but I look forward to reading his 2008 book."
4,Losing Faith in Faith,"I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it anyone. Dan Barker is the head of public relations at the Freedom from Religion Foundation , and accordingly, has mastered the art of presentation. The stories and reasoning are warm and lucid. Great book, I look forward to the next!"
4,This book strikes a chord in all who wonder to themselves,"As a former Christian who just recently accepted the fact that the bible does not fulfil it's promises, I was amazed at how simular our struggles were. Barker is very good at painting the picture of his former self, which not many fundamentalists can match. To share these feelings strengthens my resolve to remain a freethinker."
1,This book is a Joke,"I am credited with writing this review. I did not. robert j. norrellOnce you get past all of Barker's egotistical ramblings about how brave he was in coming out and how he was rejected by ""fundamentalists,"" You come to the portion of the book where he addresses theistic argument. In 10 pages. George Smith's ""Atheism: the Case against God"" is upwards of three hundred pages and still doesn't deal adequatly with the subject. I particularly enjoyed Barker's ""critique"" of C. S. Lewis's ""Mere Christianity,"" where he completely missed the entire point of the moral argument. There is one good thing about this book though. Oh wait, no there isn't."
4,Good introduction to atheism.,"This is a good all-around introduction to why Christians become atheists. It is not, however, an exhaustive study of atheism or Christian mythology. Readers wanting a deeper understanding of the issues should continue on with the other authors referred to in this work."
3,A nice try - But ultimately a failure.,"Dan Barker's work LFIF is a failed attempt to debunk WESTERN Christian thought and thus a diatribe against faith in God.It is tired and reworked in it ideas, although well phrased and catchy at times.But the biggest problem is Barker fails to realize there are other ways of viewing the Judeo/Christian God. With his main focus on western Christian thought he fails to address Orthodox Judaism and Eastern Christian thought which in many ways is diametrically opposed to much of Western Christian thinking.None the less, this is a good book to have just to attempt to understand so called ""de-conversions""."
1,Imperfect...not worth reading,"One of the worst critcisms of Christianity! This is high school stuff. Speaking of high school, Dan Barker is rather childish when it comes to the question of induction. He says he believes in induction, then he says he doesn't believe in induction, then he thinks the question of induction is not important. So, which one is it? He's scared about what the justification of induction entails...a Christian worldview! Anybody who debates him should bring up the question of induction because he doesn't know anything about it... and he knows it's important. Every philosopher and scientist in the world has to believe in it. Not believing in it is foolishness."
3,From Preacher to Preacher,"Though you abandon all religious or political faith, you will preserve the tenacity and the intolerance that impelled you to adopt it. You will still be in a rage, but your rage will be directed against the abandoned belief; fanaticism, linked to your very essence, will persist there independent of the convictions you can defend or reject. The basis, your basis remains the same, and it is not by changing opinions that you will manage to modify it.E.M. Cioran"
1,Why Waste Your Money?,"Like I did. I bought a copy of this book before I saw his debate with Michael Butler. It seems that Dan Barker fell into every trap that Butler left for him. Barker constantly begged the question on issues of morality, made ad hominem arguments, and couldn't justify morality. You can pick up on all this fallacies in this book. What's most disturbing and troublesome is that he doesn't have ""one hundred percent"" confidence in induction. What kind of world does Barker live in?! You have to believe in induction. It's like telling me that oxygen doesn't exist, yet all the while you're breathing...."
2,This book misses the mark. Literally so.,"It is not Christianity that fears questions, and Christianity does not teach that you should be afraid to think. It is the fundamentalists and their spiritless dogma that causes these attitudes. This book is directed at fundamentalism only. This book misses something important. There is more to Christianity than fundamentalism. Something much more."
1,Not threatening in the least,"Mr. Barker made a 180 degree turn in his beliefs. He went from being a preacher to being an atheist. He obviously never had any firm beliefs in the first place. I've read much more intelligent and thought-provoking books on both sides of the debate; this book is just disturbing. Does anyone really care to hear about this man's ""deconversion""? Thousands of people fall out of Christianity-he says himself he can't stand the idea of a ""judgmental"" God- so what makes him so special? He wrote a book about it? So what? And he says the Bible invented sin. He seems to have a skewed view of things. His story is truly sad."
2,Do You Dare Face the Facts?,"The single, greatest book ever written about Atheism v. Christianity is from C.S. Lewis. The book is called ""Mere Christianity."" Review it in the face of Mr. Barker's book. You will see what no-nonsense, intense scrutiny of the issues is realy all about. Mere Christianity is probably the greatest book on any subject that I have ever read. Don't be afraid. As for the two stars here, give the guy guts for trying. However, if you really want to try, read C.S. Lewis."
1,These arguments were slain by Peter Kreeft already.,"Go and read select chapters from Peter Kreeft's 'Handbook of Christian Apologetics', as the questions arise from this book.You will find that Kreeft's book demolishes every claim this book has to offer. There are many books on Christian apologetics, some by not-so-literate writers, and many which this book by Baker would sufficiently question and perplex. But honestly. Take a look at Kreeft's Handbook and you'll find Dan Barker is out of his league. The problem with him seems to be that he has personal issues (clearly shown by his bio) which prevent him from researching these questions to the intellectual limits."
2,One question...,"Upon reading Barker's account of going from ""Christian"" preacher to avowed atheist, I honestly wonder if he was really a Christian in the first place. There is more to being a Christian than what you do with a chunk of your time. It's about whether you are in relationship with Christ. A Christian is who you are, not what you do. Barker seemed on the outside to be devoted to Christ, but in his heart it appeared more like he was going through the motions and ""playing Christian."" I don't think that the book is really about Barker's conversion from Christian to atheist as much as it is about his choice to be open with the unbelief that was already there in the first place.So in terms of how we look at the book, it's not written from the perspective of an atheist that converted from Christianity, it's written from a perspective of an atheist who is a product of a lifetime of unbelief."
1,"Dan is Still Preaching,,,,albeit Dans word not God's","As an ex-Atheist raised in a Christian home....I thought this book would be interesting, and useful in debate. Mr. Barker seems to be a ""Green-Thumb"" in debate. Infact, if his claim that some christian colleges wouldnt take him up on debating him....if true...they did him a favor. His arguments are very simple, and he hangs himself about every chapter. This guy is just tooting his own horn....and it's shrill. His so-called christianty sounded like he and his parents were a spinoff from pavlovs dog experiment. They seem so weak minded that I suppose I should feel sorry for these malcontents. Dan you are still preaching, but now I guess you are God.....Good Luck. How about a refund!"
1,Horrible!!,"I can't believe this! You have got to be kidding me! I could sit here for years and analyze the wrongs to this book! I'll give you one example on the review page he says that God ordered the sacrifice of human and animal blood for Him??? It's not the angry, revolting God we think of, it's all symbolic! The slaying of the lambs and other animals are ONLY sybolic for the coming Christ and what he did for us. He sacrificed himself, and until then, the Jews of the Old Testament had nothing to atone for their sins! You've heard this over and over and I can't believe the load of it I am hearing about this. You have to be kidding me..."
4,A Good Book,"Would that more sincere doubters and truthseekers would get their hands on works like this! Dan has been on both sides of the fence -- believer and atheist, and therefore, can speak with a certain authority that few can claim to have. I read this as a defecting minister myself. I found much of the information helpful.The book is segmented as a compiled series of articles on varying topics. Dan begins by telling his story and then moves into dealing with different themes throughout the book. The book is not exhaustive and not extremely indepth, and is arguably a little too personal in its style of presenting facts, but still easily makes the cut as an excellent work that should be read by anyone looking to examine atheism vs. Christianity or freethought.(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"
5,Eye opening!,"This book is a must for anyone who has ever questioned the christian religion(s). Dan Barker is intelligent, elloquent and has crafted a wonderful book for anyone looking for some not so spiritual guidance."
3,"Good Information, Flawed Style","This book contains useful, easy to read, fairly well organized information. However, the sarcasm becomes tiring and is typically unnecessary. Barker could have knocked 25 pages off this book if he would have been less rabid and more focused. I got tired of weeding through the BS to get to his main points. It's no wonder that many christians take offense to this book...it has some of the same flavor used by fundamentalists to attack atheists. For a well balanced perspective I suggest reading Atheist Universe, Natural Atheism, and Atheism: The Case Against God. I don't think that Barker's book is bad, but it's certainly written for a particular type of reader."
4,A valuable experience,"Dan Barker's ""Losing Faith in Faith"" was the first book I read upon realizing atheism. His is a fast-paced and enlightening introduction to freethought for anyone in doubt, or anyone wanting to understand on what grounds a Christian might come to reject his faith. A personal narrative, his words encouraged me to explore rationalism further, comforted me that I was not the only person in the world with these sorts of thoughts running through my head, and fascinated me with his story of deconversion. Barker's perspective of having interpreted the world from within two opposing worldviews puts his book in a special category. The only thing about the book I found disappointing was the amount of space given to his deconversion experience. I'd have really liked to get into his mind more on that subject. But, that one complaint isn't enough to dissuade me from considering this read a very valuable experience during my own conversion, such as it was."
3,"eh, it was decent","I loved THe Bridge to Terabithia & expected Park's Quest to be of a similar caliber. I was disappointed with it, but i read it so long ago i can't remember exactly why. Just be warned: This is no Bridge to Terabithia. I haven't read any of Katherine Paterson's other books but i plan to, simply in hopes of recapturing the magic found in TBTT."
1,Park's Quest,Ididn't really like this book because it didn't make sense. It didn't make sense because he daydreamed so much you didn't no if he was daydreaming or not. I also didn't like it becuse the words werent discribed that well. Another reason I didn't like it was because it was confusing. It was confusing because it sounded all scrambled up.
3,boy uncovers truth about his father,"I picked this up for 25p at Bookworld in Edinburgh, and it was good for the price. Katherine Paterson writes well, but this book does not have the complexity or the punch of Bridge to Teribithia. Park, an eleven year old boy lives with his mother. His father died in Vietnam, but his mother won't talk about him. At Park's insistance, he is allowed to go on a visit for two weeks to his father's family, where he finds out about the family history. Park is fascinated with stories about King Arthur and knights and chivalry, and he often day dreams about his life and his father in those terms. Predictably, the truth is a grim contrast.This is not a particularly happy or comforting story. Nor does it have the emotional depth of Katherine Paterson's other books. I would not have liked it much when I was in the 10-12 age-group. At 27, it was worth the 40 minutes it took to read."
5,Great read aloud.,"My 10 year old daughter and I read this book together. I couldn't help it, I just had to read ahead after she went to bed at night! Hope you enjoy it as well. The only other book we've read together that had the same effect on me was ""Letters from Rifka."" (K. Hesse)"
3,Oops...Mr Canin!,"Ethan Canin is obviously an awesome writer, no one needs me to say that. but this novel is perhaps his second worst. It's form is overly complicate dand at times you can feel the author (or narrator) getting lost in the mix of it. The story itself is rather ingenious, but it's hard to enjoy it with all the falshes of information coming at the reader out of order. I can't really recommend this one, but I am looking forward to his next."
3,Clever yet disappointing,"Canin attended medical school and now teaches writing in Iowa. The resulting style is clear, pure, and academic. And little more. ""Carry me across the water"" offers glimpses of a man's life from several perspectives: fleeing Europe, fighting war in the Pacific, retiring in Boston, building a business in Pittsburgh, and visiting a grandson in New York. All these opportunities for depth, character, enrichment and color receive scant treatment in this very short novel, begging the author to add some insight. Each of these brief eras could merit a book. Instead, we have abbreviated, witty, colorful snapshots."
5,Short Story/Novel Hybrid,"For those who love Canin's two volumes of short stories but have been disappointed by the novels, ""Carry Me Across The Water"" should make you very happy indeed. The subject certainly warrents a book of some length. John Casey or John Irving could have told this story very neatly in 500 or more pages. Instead Canin chooses to compress the material into a series of short chapters that are just as effective and moving as a longer book would have been. This is a family novel which focuses on one member of the family while showing purely rendered portraits of the rest. A gem."
4,Worth the read........,"Beautifully told. Sensitive. Heartbreaking. Humourous. The story of August Kleinman - his life, his reflections, his strength and compassion - will keep you turning the page. This is not just one man's story, but a story about life itself. Buy the book."
5,Utterly Compelling,"August Kleinman is Canin's most compelling character to date. It is Canin's concern for his characters and the moral implications of their actions that sets him apart as a writer. In telling the story of this life, which covers three continents and much of what was important in the 20th century, Canin delivers not only an intriguing tale but a lesson in what life can offer."
3,bearing issue,"This rolling pin appeared to be very workable, unfortunatly what is described as ""Ball-bearing action"" does not mean true Ball-bearing construction, the interior is lined with teflon."
5,Purchased this as a gift.,I purchased this item on specific instructions from an elderly relative who loves opera. He was very satisfied with it and he is very particular so I rated it with five stars
5,Outstanding recording and cast of this superb opera,"Everything is superb concerning this recording. The singers are at their prime, orchestra and conductor are excellent. Domingo and Arroyo are fantastic in this most difficult of Verdi's operas. Highly recommended - play it loud!!!"
2,Self-Help Spirituality Is Too Gung Ho,"Rabbi Dosick apparently believes that the way to help people become more spiritual is by using the self-help mode: do this exercise, think these thoughts, Know God Loves You, et cetera. Thoughtful analyses of the doubts that hinder all too many people from becoming spiritual won't be found in this gung-ho manifesto filled with trite one-sentence paragraphs. The book might work for someone who's already a believer and doesn't need much of a push to become more spiritual. But if you're troubled by questions about God's existence and purpose and you need well-thought-out answers, look elsewhere."
3,The Brave One,"A List of RKO films had given rave billed up new youngster Micheal Ray,all young stars of the day another great new star was born,a good story but abit to earley for young star.D.B."
5,The Brave One,It was a very old movie that I thought I would never find. It was just as good as when I saw it years ago. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Oops!,"We got Suddenly! for my three boys (ages 8,6, and 3) and they loved it. So they were really excited when we got them Oops!Colin McNaughton's stories are so successful because you get to yell when you read them. My boys like loud fun books.We really enjoyed Oops! The boys said it could have used a few more yelling parts (there aren't as many as in Suddenly!) but they enjoyed the humor and have added it to their list of favorites."
5,A book more people need to read and take to heart,"This book sets on its ear the common misinterpretation of ""The Prayer of Jabez"" and other parts of the Bible as commanding personal materialism and selfishness. It examines the Lord's Prayer line by line, showing how Christians can live more as Jesus would live.It's a timely antidote to the church-sanctioned culture of greed followed by so many American Christians. Parts of it literally made my jaw drop. Thank you, Rev. Mulholland, for a thought-provoking and inspiring book. I'll be buying and distributing several copies."
4,Valuable addition to my library,"A great read for those who are trying to put new life and spirit into their use of the Lord's Prayer. The book makes the reader focus on each phrase and what the praying Christian can bring to and take from the experience of prayer. I will read this book many times, and make it mine slowly but surely."
5,This was a cool little lifetime film...,"I always liked this movie and it inspires me to want to go to Paris someday. It was great to watch Linda Hamilton's character go from this repressed career woman to a woman with Joie de viev (I think I spelled that right). Very inspirational and enjoyable to watch and a bit of a lesson for many American woman who love trudging around in greasy old jogging clothes, shopping at Target and then come home asking, ""Why doesn't my husband make love to me anymore"" or ""Why is he leaving me"" or ""Why isn't he romantic"". Watch this film and you'll know why. It definitely takes a little something from both sides to get inspired."
5,VERY INTERESTING!,"I saw the movie on Lifetime one Sunday and after it was over, got on thecomputer to order my very own copy. Sensuality, can bring about longevityin a relationship. This is just what the doctor ordered for me to take a good look at myself and re-kindle a luke warm relationship."
2,broke tape,The iape was broke . Never mind I fix it. Please check them before sending. ( this e mail need 5 more words to sendhere that are)
2,Yawn..Where is the sexiness in Mrs. X?,"Bisset has a forced French accent as she portrays the Madame that Hamilton's frustratedjournalist travels to visit to learn lessons of love when she learns she is losing her husband in this chat opera. No doubt the divorce papers must have read as grounds, ""terminal boredom."" Jaqueline Bisset's previous features such as ""Wild Orchid"" where she always kept her clothes on while her costars all shed theirs were really more of an asset to her career than this film which could compete with ""My Fair Lady"" and win an Oscar for blandness."
1,This film is...how you say in French...mer**,"This movie is an adulterated chick flick targeted at the 40+ crowd, in my estimation. The remarkably poor directing, exaggerated French accents and recycled storyline made me reach for my computer for something useful to do while I waited for the film to end.Please don't make your man sit through this drivel. Get Sex and the City instead. It might not be set in ""la ville d'amour"", but the writing is much better.(I was forced to watch this with the women in the family, and I'm typing this towards the end of the movie.)"
2,No. No *sigh no*,"This is hardly hot, even for chick flick wanna be porn.Every cliche possible and minimal imagination. Jacqueline Bisset, a lovely and talented actress walks through this as bored as you will be.The heroine meets nothing but handsome, rich well dressed and coiffed men. So of course she falls for the guy with the three day beard... every day its a three day growth, did I mention he is a photographer. Did I mention she is married? Ok, all the women other women we see are classy hookers? - classy as in expensively dressed, no nudes please - But they are all going to marry rich sugar daddys who all marry for love. And they all get lovely, customized, high fashion wedding gowns.Dull and not at all sexy."
1,BEWARE: This is a PAL Version.,"This DVD will NOT WORK ON YOUR DVD PLAYER at all, unless you have an NTSC & PAL player. Beware and do not buy this. It's not the price, it's the shipping cost for a DVD that won't work on your machine."
1,Worst read yet,I am always amused by pathetic technical books but this one has got to take the cake. Well done.
3,dry and confused,"in the advanced chapters you can find some good technical stuff. However, the book is not clear and does not contain any special insights. Also it has some small technical mistakes, for example it says that threads that were instantiated using a Runnable cannot be restarted(which is not true -try for yourself). My advice is to spend your time reading a really good book on networking (like Java notwork programming by Merlin Hughes and co) and find specific technicalities in the web."
4,Good story,"Another book my mom read to me when I was about 10 years old. This is a very well paced story which doesn't lag on detail and moves quickly (for a Victoria Holt book that is) Holt has an elegant writing style and no explict love scenes. She relies on good storylines and her characters are believable. Overall, I thought it was a great book and I don't want to post any spoilers but I'll just say I found the ending to be too intense. There are other Holt books I liked better but that's just my opinion. It was a powerful story and I enjoyed it."
5,READ ME!!! READ ME!!!,"This is one of my favorite Victoria Holt novels! Sarah's mother is a famous actress that dies mysteriously. Sarah feels alone in the world, so she marries to escape a life of boredom with her aunts. When her father dies, she inherits his land in India, which just happens to be right by her new husbands'! She also finds out about a pearl necklace that her half sister inherits that seems to be trouble. After a while, she feels her life is in danger. Who is the suspect? Her husband!I got so into this book that I stayed up half the night to finish it! Then, it took me the other half to recover from the shock of the end! I can't say anything more except READ THIS BOOK!!!"
2,slightly better than others,"But please. How obvious is it who the culprit is? How come it's always the person the heroine trusts the most, or suspects the least. For once could one of the suspects have dunnit. It would actually, despite what the author may have thought, make it less predictable."
1,Not So Great Hoax Book,"The title is, unsurprisingly, a hoax - unless you consider the UK equivalent to the world; they should have kept the original title ""Hoaxers and Their Victims"". While there was much amusing information, this seemed like a college thesis which had been rearranged into chapters and had a cover slapped on it. The Brits are known for dry humor, but this was simply dry. With so many references to hoaxers names (both those previously mentioned and those for which information was to come), it was extremely difficult to keep track of what any individual or group had done, let alone how these frequent references fit in with the current hoax under discussion. I would much prefer to read the Urban Legends Reference Pages website (URLs are not to be included, but when you get to the Snopes domain, you're in the right place :-). Someone please help me find a good hoax book, because this isn't it. . . - g^2"
1,NOT for a powerbook G4,"despite the description, this is NOT for a powerbook G4. my original adapter melted (frightening), and i thought i'd found a good replacement. however, the specs of the plug (that goes into the computer) on this particular adapter replacement are slightly different from an original adapter, and the adapter just doesn't work when plugged in (don't know if it's due to the ill-fitting plug or if they were all defective). i tried multiple ones of these adapters (happened to be able to physically go to the vendor's office) and none of them worked.so instead, i ended up ordering a replacement from the apple store--i know i'm getting ripped off for an incredibly fragile piece of equipment, but at least i know it'll be the right one. there are lots of suggestions for alternate (non-apple) adapters, and once they make on with the indicator ring, i'll get it. but i really like the indicator ring and how compact the apple adapter is."
1,Don't waste your money,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY with this cheap copy and buy the original one. It was too tight so it chipped and broke within 1 WEEK of use so I can't use it anymore. The original one that came with the computer lasted for three years.
1,Well it didn't work for me,"This adaptor worked fine for about two months, but I did notice it getting pretty hot. The piece that connects it to the computer cracked early on and would fall out regularly. It started making strange noises one day and then stopped working."
1,Don't bother,"They all die within a ridiculously short amount of time, so why on Earth would I pay this much for one? The only complaint I'll ever have about an Apple - they really need to rethink their power supply design. The wires on the originals are so tiny and fragile there's no preserving them and these off-brand models with their odd, mid-cord converters are feeble from their loose connections to their flimsy construction. But since you MUST have power, I suggest buying the least expensive model you can find. At least that way it won't be such a loss when it dies."
2,"Same as Orginal, BUT","Yes, this is the same power adapter as the original that was issued with the computer. And yes this is a very good price compared to apple BUT, Apple has now upgraded this adapter to be more safer and the cord is longer and it does not pull out of the wall like this one does. I have a IBook G4, and this cord did not last me for over 2 months because the cord kept pulling out of the computer and eventually it broke so after a visit to my local apple store I discovered that this power adapter has gotten tons of complaints about popping fire while trying to plug it in and the prongs breaking off in the computer etc. Try the new adapter, yes it is not on sale but it works alot better."
1,BROKE IN LESS THAN A MONTH,"As a lot of you probably know, these adapters SUCK.I ordered one and the plastic casing that connects to the computer cracked in a few days, then the connection underneath broke in less than a month of use. It's a tough soldering fix because the connection point is tiny.Terrible product, do yourself a favor [...]"
2,&#65533;A pig in the poke&#65533;,"What I like to tell you is that this product was just repackaged in 2001 -- not the new edition. The book is the first edition, 1996 (ISBN 0789410044) and the software is the 1998 release. As a DK book fan, I have owned these two excellent informative products for years. I hope you not to buy the duplicate as I did a week ago."
2,Mediocre,"Mediocre in terms of construction, materials, fit and finish.Good ergonomics to the hand rings for folks with arthritis, but that's all.Should be priced about $15 - maximum. This is Henckels trading on their good name and producing a disappointment."
1,watch out with xp !!,This antivirus does not work well with windows xp. After downloading windows service pack 1 scanning slowed to a crawl half way thru and caused a major power drain on my system. Also causes banging and clanging of hard drive on disc defragmenter and causes slowdown problems at shutdown. I removed it from my computer and switched to Safeworld anti-virus and have no problems at all..
3,Another disappoint from Ms Oliver,"Being a fan of Ms. Oliver's Regency era novels, I have looked forward to each new book, but unfortunately, her last three novels including the most current,Lady Jane's Nemesis, have fallen far short of her previous works such as The Colonel's Lady, Roses for Harriet, and Miss Drayton's Downfall. Her recent works make for pleasant albeit forgettable reading, and lack the emotional intensity and character development of her earlier novels. I suspect she is rushing her writings and thus, failing to come up to her own standards. Let us hope that this is a temporary fault of a fine writer."
4,Lady Jane's Nemesis,"What can a girl do but wait when she has been betrothed from birth? Lady Jane Sinclair has been in love with her fiancé Roger Hastings, Viscount Summers, since she was a child. Then Jane catches a glimpse of Roger in a romantic idyll with their neighbor's young wife. Roger is not ready to step into the parson's mousetrap. His father's gambling debts are high, and he urges his son to honor his betrothal and wed Jane who is an heiress. Having seen what she had seen, Jane is reluctant to accept Roger. How can she trust him? She dreams of a loving marriage with a faithful husband. Patricia Oliver offers a marriage of convenience between two neighboring families, where the reluctant bride loves the reluctant hero, knowing too much about his romantic life. Lady Jane's Nemesis has a twist, the pregnant mistress. Makes for a fun read. Ms. Oliver will please your reading palette."
4,I enjoyed this book,"Lady Jane's Nemesis was a fun, enjoyable book to read. The plot is well-paced and has the interesting twist of the man in love with his mistress but honor bound to a marriage of convenience. Both of the lead characters were interesting and seemed true to life. The only thing which detracted from the book and why I only rated it 4 stars was the ghost on the lake. I don't care for ghost sightings in Regency Romances. Otherwise, this is a very good book. Not as good as some earlier Patricia Oliver books, but well worth the read."
4,Really neat stencils,Only wished I had used them more. Used a couple but got stuck in a junk drawer somewhere.
4,Introduction to Old English,"Not as good as Mitchell or Sweet, and harder to use than Pollington, it is none-the-less a good supplimentary text for learning Old English."
5,Learning Old English? Begin Here,"Dr. Baker's ""Introduction to Old English"" is probably the best book for a person to use who has no previous experience with either Old English or traditional linguistics. I used this book as an undergraduate taking a graduate Old English course and found it most enjoyable and useful. Each chapter is quite easy to follow, and usually contain at least one ""mini-text"" which are short texts in Old English that you can read along the way. This method is especially useful; by the time you begin with the anthology of literature located in the back of the book, you've already read some simplier passages of Old English.The book is worth its retail price simply for its collection of literature. Included here are the ""The Wife's Lament"", ""The Wanderer"", ""Wulf and Eadwacer"" and excerpts from ""Judith"" and ""Beowulf"". This book is even helpful for someone who has no previous study in the history of the English language, although those who do will find this book superbly accesible."
3,It gets the job done...sort of.,"Baker's text is pretty decent, but there are some problems. In the chapter on verbs, the first strong and weak verb endings paradigm is labeled incorrectly--strong verbs are labeled as weak and vice-versa. This is a horrible blunder. There are other errors as well, but this is the worst one I think.Furthermore, Baker compresses weeks and weeks of learning into a few chapters, which is irritating. The chapters are listed something like, ""Nouns,"" ""Verbs,"" ""Adjectives,"" etc. For an inflected language, this means tons of info crammed into single chapters. Not the way I like to learn.The choice of texts in the reader is good, and the mini-text translation exercises are an interesting accoutrement, but the lack of intermittent vocabulary is disappointing. If you have studied Wheelock's Latin Grammar or Bright's Old English Grammar, you know what I mean."
5,Excellent Text,"I bought a copy of Baker's Introduction to Old English while taking a graduate course in order to supplement the other texts used. I found this to be a fantastic resource for the solo learner. The explanations were precise yet easy to understand and the exercises helped to illuminate the grammar points. I really enjoyed the online exercises, standard these days in foreign language courses, which quickly allowed me to grasp concepts. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Old English."
2,Not good,I bought a pair of these Boston speakers thinking they would be good for the money. I hate to say I am disappointed. Granted they were reasonably priced. I was just expecting a better sound.
4,"I enjoyed it, but then I am biased.....","I enjoyed this book because I like his style and the impassionate way he analyses aircraft behaviour most likely because he was a test pilot for so long. I own just about everything he has ever published. Like others I think he underrates the Corsair but as an RAF techie, what do I know?"
3,Comes with Atmospheric Music,"From the preview, it seemed like this CD would be purely the sounds of the whale, but it has ambient music playing as well. The music isn't that bad, it's just not what I was expecting."
2,No Battery Life,"The phone works just fine, but I've had it less than 6 months and it doesn't want to hold a charge anymore. It gives warning beeps in less than 5 minutes after having charged all night. Now. . . Do I buy a new battery for $[...] bucks or just get a new phone?"
3,"""Eh."" She shrugged.","If I'd bought each of these books separately and paid 6 bucks a pop for them, I'd have been annoyed. As it was, I spent not too much money for an enjoyable four hours or so. They're not too lightweight for tie-in novels, but inasmuch as I didn't come to these books knowing and loving the characters, I wanted the author to make me love them. And he didn't.However, these guys are recognizably Federation in their attitudes and actions, and if you like the world of Star Trek but aren't that attached to specific people in it, this just might be an amusing read."
2,"Interesting Characters, But Overall a Disappointment","May the Great Bird of the Galaxy poop on the heads of John J. Ordover and Peter David! Although this book introduces some interesting and entertaining new characters (e.g., MacKenzie Calhoun and Zak Kebron), the book is marred by typos and careless errors of grammar, style, usage, and an ending that's just absolutely ridiculous--farce, really. My copy even has cheap paper and smeared ink! The whole thing smacks of something hastily slapped together to make a quick buck off the Star Trek concept."
4,Good ground work for a new crew.,"When this work first appeared on the shelves at my local bookstore, I thought, ""Oh no! Not another cheezy extension of the Star Trek universe!"" But, I was pleasantly suprised. I considered the tie-ins with the old TNG crew well done. They showed me that it is one galaxy, not four separate ones. Also the characterization of the new crew was wonderful. I love all the inner conflict! The action was nail-biting. The plot was intriguing. Not only do you see the early stages of friendship in the crew, but you also develop the same kind attachments as you have to the series crews. Overall, Peter David is up to par. I literally read all four books in two days."
5,Intense action,I read these books years ago and thoroughly enjoyed reading them again! I highly recommend these books to anyone who likes Star Trek.
5,Best deal fit the money,"The plants arrived super fast, the packaging was perfect, and the plants were in perfect shape when they arrived. The description stated there were multiple plants in one pot. I figured 3-4 plants we got a pot with 11 plants and all of them were healthy and hearty. They needed to be re-potted with in days of arrival because they grew do quickly. I totally recommend these coffee plants to everyone"
3,They're doing okay,"The plants appeared arrived in good health and they grew okay for a while. I'm must be doing something wrong because they're all starting to get brown leaves and while they're not dying, they're not thriving either. The directions weren't specific to the plants, so i have no idea what I'm doing wrong. Customer service wasn't helpful either, they just repeated the directions they sent to me. Ugh. Oh well, I'm crossing my fingers and hoping for the best."
5,AMAZING - healthy seedlings with lots of perfect leaves,"This plant had so many perfect leaves that it looked like an artificial plant when I was pulling it out of the box. There are 10 seedlings in the pot and they all look very healthy. The directions about water, light and replanting are very specific and easy to understand. Only a small amt of the dirt spilled out in transit - not enough to hurt the plants. There was still plenty in the pot with the seedlings. I plan to keep them as house plants, but if you want to put them outside, you need to watch the temperature when you replant them. The directions also included what to do the first few days after the plants arrive - don't repot right away, don't put them out yet if it's cold, etc.I've ordered various products from Hirt's Gardens over the past few years and I've never been disappointed. I'm looking forward to seeing them grow this spring."
5,great looking plants,"The trees are not 5"" tall or taller. Other than that great packaging for shipping.No dirt was spilled out becausethey put masking tape over the top of the planter it came in.They say there are a couple plants but the truth is whenseperated them there were 9 plants. I am very happy about my purchase.They are growing in my house in inderectSun."
4,my coffee plants,"my coffee plants i bought from hirt's nursery are doing pretty well. although when i emailed hirt's with some questions about the care of my new plants, they were not very helpful. they only replied with a web site to go to that wasn't even theirs. e-how.com was alot more helpful with the questions i had, then the web site they gave me. i still have some questions, but if i can't find it, i learn as i go. i do plan on buying more coffee planrs from hirt's because they were very healthy when they arrived and arrived just a few days after i ordered them. they are looking better now that i am misting them once a day and have put a little used coffee grounds around the plant in the pot. with the high cost of coffee, i love the thought of growing and harvesting my own coffee one day."
5,coffee plants,"I bought a plant, or plants(?), which are now in my kitchen window. Seem to be growing well, but I'm hoping they survive the winter. I also bought some coffee seeds and have planted them in a BioDome starter tray, which is like a little mini greanhouse, and hopefully they will grow as well. Of course I suppose I should have this outside during the summer, but I'm not sure until I see how it does that I want to take that chance. I'm looking forward to good results though and maybe the seeds I bought will be something to look forward to this winter."
5,very healthy plant,The plant arrived on-time with a heating element so it would not freeze. The plant remains very healthy and is what I expected.
2,Not Aluminum,"I received the cooling racks only to find that they are constructed of heavy gauge steel with chrome plating, rather than being aluminum as described (I even called Kaiser to confirm). Their appearance and weight are nearly identical to the racks in our oven. These may not be suitable for someone looking for general-purpose baking racks for home use."
3,"Okay, but I found better","The problem with so many money books is they assume that being rich is what matters most. Of course financial security is nice, but if you make money the focus of your life, you're lost. After plowing through a ton of financial books, I found only one (The Mindful Money Guide) that seems truly balanced about money. This wise book recognizes the virtue of simplifying your finances without forgetting about the bottom line. It also recognizes the emotional and social effects of money."
3,everyones money book,it arrived in a timely process and im learning more information as i read the book
4,great book!,This book was very helpful. After reading it I understand the terminology and principles behind investing. I also like the fact that the book helped you on your way as well by giving you further resources and tools to use after you're finished reading the book. I would definitely recommend this book to new investors! I would also recommend first reading Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and Think Like a Billionaire by Scot Anderson.
3,Great Quality but......,"I purchased a ball for $10 from Wal Mart and didn't feel it had any stability and was very flimsy. The gym I use trains with the Spri brand so I thought this would be similar if not the exact ball. The quality was great, but unfortunately this is not the size I am used to hence the 3 star rating.I am 5'5' and the recommended size is 55, but the 55 in my gym and the 55 I am looking at are 2 different sizes. I am sending this one back and ordering a 65 instead. I am not sure if they have a different product line that they use for professionals, but I am very disappointed.This ball inflates to roughly double the size of a beach ball, and when seated you aren't high enough off the ground to do many of the moves effectively. Forget doing bridges, you might as well do them on the ground for all the height you get."
1,Murky and Boring,"The film presents several nude men swimming through a set meant to resemble ruins of Atlantis. The lighting is murky in the extreme, making it difficult to enjoy the one thing ""Boyfish"" has to offer, the beautiful bodies of the swimming men. Nothing happens onscreen beyond the swimmers crossing the screen from time to time. It is animated wallpaper for your television. Erotic? I don't think so."
2,No fun,"These cars keep flying out of the tracks as they go around the flexi bend. It looks so cool when it works, but when I do it, I can get the car to go around successfully maybe one in ten times. My three year old? Forget it! I tried revving the cars as little as possible, thinking they had too much juice, but no such luck. We're returning it 2 hours after assembling."
3,"Parents prefer this track, son prefers Hot Wheels","My 5-year-old son received this Darda track from his grandparents, and the Hot Wheels 6-in-1 Starter Track from Santa.The Darda track is much higher quality than the Hot Wheels. It's much much easier to put together and stays together better. It's also easier to reconfigure into other layouts, as each piece of track is more ""general purpose"". The Darda is brightly colored and more visually appealing than the Hot Wheels. The cars are propelled by a pull-back mechanism. The Hot Wheels has a loud battery operator ""chute"" that propels the cars.My son likes both tracks. But he plays with the Hot Wheels track much more than the Darda track. I can't tell if it's because it uses his already-beloved cars, or because it can send cars around continously, or because the cars crash more often."
5,great race track,"I bought this for my 3 year old son. He is still getting into it, but I think he will play with it for a long time to come. Other kids have also loved it - even teenager. The racing feature is very fun."
3,Fun Track,"We bought both this track and the Darda Upside Down Overpass for two of our grandsons for Christmas 2009. This track was bought for the 7-year old and is much easier to assemble than the other. However, grandpa did most of the assembly. We taped the track down to the floor so that it wouldn't lift. One of the cars that came with the set broke within the first day of use and we are having to buy another car. Our grandson enjoyed the fact that he could win a race (we used the malfunctioning car) and that the flag showed the winner. The set is now in the guest room of our house because it is too large to keep assembled in our son's bedroom at his house. We expect that it will get a lot of use when either of the grandsons are visiting."
5,"new & vintage, all at the same time","The Capris, who cut ""There's a Moon Out Tonight"" back in the '50s, unfortunately couldn't sustain a music career so they all went their separate ways into regualar jobs. The excellence of that tune eventually made some of the doo wop intelligensia sit up and take notice. This CD is of recently-penned tunes you'd swear were written in the 50's (except John Lennon's ""Imagine."") This is great stuff; I can't recommend it highly enough. You'll kick yourself if you pass this one by!"
3,Sebastian comes through to solve mystery of cursed play.,"The book does not have a wonderful and jumpy beginning, but the ending makes the 142 pages worthwhile! My favorite part of the book was learning in the theater, refer to ""Hamlet"" as the Scottish play or the play will have bad luck. I am a fan of all of the Sebastian Barth mysteries, but this book ranks as one of my favorites!"
5,This movie is very touching and funny!,"The story is surprisingly interesting and touching. I saw a lot of movies about immigrants in America (I am an immigrant myself, so excuse me if my review is a little hard to understand), but this is the best movie ever. I think all actors are great, and fit their roles perfectly. I loved the most the character of a mother from Vietnam. I also liked Samantha, because she is funny, interesting, and beautiful. This is a movie I could not get tired of watching. I hope it gets all the credit it deserves."
4,Well Worth the Time and Money,"I watched this movie first on Blackstars Network, the title really caught my attention. It turned out to be the best movie about real family life that I have seen. I have recommended it to everyone I know and they all have agreed that it's a great movie. We don't get many independent movies here in this small southern city, so I had never even heard of the film. Thank you cable T.V.. I will continue to look for more movies from this very talented young man and all the cast members."
4,I loved this movie,I thought that this was a great movie. I love Sanaa Latham. Her love interest is an Asian male that is adopted by a black family. He and his sister are sent from Vietnam during the war. They aren't sure if their mother is a live ir dead. The sister decdes to look for her and she finds her and brings her to the states. This causes problems for the black mother that can believe that her adopted daughter is so ungrateful. Great story.
5,So much to take in but worth the effort,Great book for those interested in Buddhism. I have just started getting involved in Buddhism and this book is a great asset. Do not think you will read or listen to it just once. You will continue to pour over this book and each time get more knowledge out if.
2,did not finish it,"I bought the book for general interest, not for religious or philosophical purpose. It just never took off from there and I never finished it, the writing style just did not keep my interest. I guess I was looking for a more concrete path."
2,same as last year.,"Nothing differant except new names and carrectors.nevt year count me out, Machan has all the money I can afford.no more"
3,"Nice content, but poor structure","There's plenty of good information and some nice anecdotes in this history, but it's presented non-chronologically as a loose string of biographies grouped under almost arbitrary chapter headings. The biographies leap into each other abruptly, and after a while it becomes impossible to distinguish individuals among the parade of similar faces. There are some nice analyses of some major albums, though, and it seems like a good starting point for someone trying to determine which recordings might paint the best picture of the hard bop era. Still...there's no long line to follow, and the last quarter feels like a grind."
4,Nip/Tuck-2nd Season,"Love the show! This was the first time that I didn't get my product quickly, that's the only reason I marked it down. Other than that no complaints!"
3,Good series that keeps you entertained and is brave and original,I have not watched season one but I still got most of the stories in season 2. Nip/Tuck is a brave and origianl show that should keep you entertained through out all the episodes. The acting is good from all actors. The storiesa re all good becouse they keep you comming back for more. The best story line was the Carver story line and the life coach with a shocking past. The seaon finale was really good that left you on the edge of your seat.
5,Amazing Series,"Nip/Tuck season two is a continuation on the first season of one of the most compelling serieses on TV, and is just as good. The best show on TV."
3,okk,"Box was reallly ripped apart...2 of the Cd's skipped, and had to take them out and wash them. Overall okay, couldnt beat the price...just wish it was a little better"
4,Nip/Tuck,"Good show. Only watched the first 3 seasons, got a bit too crazy after that for me. Intriguing cases and off the wall characters make the show."
5,Fast Service,I recieved Nip Tuck Season 1 and 2 during the Christmas season rush in only 3 days. Very happy!
4,Excellent condition,As good as new and half the price. Season 2 is not as good as Season 1( I discovered the series late and so I'm working my way up to the present season)
1,"COME ON, SEX CHANGES AND SOAP OPERAS?","I understand that the show is a soap of sorts, but does it have to be a bad soap?"
5,I love this show!!!,"To be completely honest, I was an on again off again watcher of the show nip/tuck. But I was fortunate to catch it on the 2nd season. I am so in love with this show. It's edgy, funny, witty, clever, charming (thanks to Dr.Troy!), and classy. It has everything one would want from a show. Humor, sex, and a plot! I serioulsy love this show if I haven't stressed it enough!"
5,Truly Amazing!,"I never thought that they could top out their first season but they did, bringing the Carver (you'll see) was awesome... so many twists and unexpected turns!"
1,"Sounds good, but can't use it","When I saw this item, I was thinking it would be great for my baking. Except, the top doesn't fit tight enough and the cover, on the other hand, fits too tight. So, when you open the sprinkler to use it the top comes off with the cover which could leave you with a lot of mess."
3,Great for powdered surgar but not much else,"It came and was a little smaller than we expected but everything was there and it came pretty quick. I wish the grate that it came with was a little bigger for what we use it for. The plastic lid is secure and it a clean unit that does the job. If you want it for powdered sugar, then it is awesome, but for granulated sugar, it is only okay for the job. So, depending on what you use it for, this is what you are looking for."
2,Plush,Why is this $600 i have one and its not even that cool. Why ??? This is stupid why would anyone spend that much on a plush especialy this one ?
4,Very handy for soccer referees,This watch is excellent for soccer referees. The preset timers are really handy as I referee different age groups with different half lengths. It's also handy that the real time is visible along with the time left in the half. The vibration alert feature is a nice touch as well.
5,Can the countdown timer vibrate at zero or whenever time reached?,"Sorry for using this forum to ask a question but I'm seriously considering buying this watch. I just have one question ... Can the vibrate feature be used with the countdown timer and can it really be set in 5 second intervals? In other words, can I set the countdown timer to say 1 minute and 40 seconds and have it auto repeat so that I can monitor my pace on the track?"
4,Superb for Soccer Refs,"As an AYSO referee, I'm responsible for games played by ten through fourteen year olds. While it's not the ""big leagues,"" getting it right is a very big deal for the kids and their parents. This watch is the best accessory I've got for the job."
1,not a phrasebook,"This was so annoying to me. This is simply a condensed dictionary with words common to medical and social service professions and rarely include accompanying phrases, like most bilingual dictionaries do. I felt that the title was very misleading. I do recommend ""Essential Spanish for Social Services"" by living language. The reference guide and audioscript are especially beneficial and go through an assessment process and clinical/ therapeutic dialogue as well."
4,"Good translations, but not a phrase book","This little book has great information for use in various settings. Small means it can travel easily in the pocket. It isn't really a phrase book, however, more of dictionary."
4,Another great sims expansion pack.,"Maxis did it again! This time party's are the main focus. You can buy buffet tables,fountain punch bowls, camp fires, and even a disco stand with flashing lights when you dance on them. You can hire the usual maids, gardners, and Annoying pizza guys, as well as caterers and male or female entertainers that pop out of a cake(one female even dresses up in a gorilla costume).If your party is a sucess a celebrity might show up. If your party is a drag a mime comes and you can't get him to leave(your guests hate him). That's pretty much the run down of this game."
4,The Sims House Party,"Bored with Livin' Large? This game is defenitly for you. It contaians tons of new objects, especialy in the buy section of the game. It also contains some new things for building and new clothing choices for your sims. The best part though, is the ""Through A Party"" option. When chosen, all of the sims in the nieghborhood come over. They get to dance in the dance cages or on the light-up floor, eat all they want at the buffet, dj the music stand and party their heart out. Still not convinced to buy this game? Buy it! You'll be glad you did."
4,COOL GAME,This is a really fun game. It is a whole lot better han Sims Liv'n Large Expansion pack and The Sims put together. You get so many new items. But if you sit there and play it a lot it can get boaring. It's a great game. If you like The Sims a lot you will like it better with The Sims House Party Expansion Pack
3,Roxxxx assss dudes,"this is a sick game so far in my sim collection i have sims superstar,sims livin large,sims vacation, and the sims i recently got the sims house party and it is the best so far!!!!i recommend it to all sims fans!!!Peace out dudes"
5,Out of all the expansion packs..,"This was definitely my favorite. It adds the ability to throw a party, without compromising the integrity of the game, which the other expansion packs do, by unnescesarily cluttering up the game. House party introduced a ""Funkier"" look to the Sims, adding all sorts of objects that were bright vibrant colors. It also introduced body models that could have blue hair. The party option was definitely the most fun. If you don't have this pack yet, I would recommend getting it, but keep in mind, the more evolved Sims 2 is coming out this year. I wouldn't buy the other packs with that in mind."
3,"Throw a party, invite your friends in!","Are you a party-animal? Get this expansion pack and you'll be able to invite all your friends and have a party at your house. Be sure to prepare the everything before inviting your friends in. Prepare the food, clean-up your house, and have yourself a good mood (not hungry, enough sleep, etc).The more friends you have, the more people are coming in to your house when you throw a party. :) This is a good way to keep the relationship between you and your friends."
5,Great expansion pack.,"This is a great expansion pack!I love it!It's new walls,doors,windows,wallpaper,plants and stairs are great .The new faces and cloths are more suitable for parting.They also put in 4 more neighbourhoods.Thre are also 100 new items such as the campfire,bubble blower,dance floor,dance cage and inflatable chairs.You can also hire a carter to help with the food.There are also more characters to party with!hire a male or female entertainer from the fancy feet cake,or,if you party is a smash Drew Carry comes,but if the Mime comes by your party is a snore!The 3 theme's are amazing!I relly love this game and recommend it to anyone who has The sims.House party is a great expansion pack."
4,good with a capital G,"The sims house party is one of the best games ive played. It is lots of fun. You can control many people in a household, and invite people from other ones too. It is called House party, because should you choose to, you can throw a perty at your house. YOu can also et a job, and have a family, like the original sims. I like this type of game, because, it deals with things we dont get to do as kids. Run a house hold, and light people on fire."
3,"OK, but they could have done more...","House Party has good new objects, I won't deny that, but there didn't seem to be many new things. It seems like Maxis just wanted to hurry up and make a new game fast, instead of adding better things to it. Livin' Large and House Party could easily on been one game, but Maxis wants you to pay 30 dollars for each, which is the price for an actual game. I don't understand that, you pay 30 dollars for most computer games and you get a whole game for that! If you like The Sims then this is not a complete waste of money, but if you play it ocasionally I would not recomend it."
2,Don't Buy This Game !!!,I own all of the Sims expansions and this one is by far the worst. This expansion gives you about 15 new items and is a waste of money and hard drive space.
3,It's Kinda Pointless,"It's ok. You should get your sims a job with less working hours, because by the time your guests arrive, it's already time for you to go to work. But it's really fun once you get the hang of it. Stuff is expensive. So better start working."
5,THE SIMS!!!,"I think that all of THE SIMS games (THE SIMS, THE SIMS LIVIN' LARGE and THE SIMS HOUSE PARTY) are both fun and educational. It is really cool getting to control a bunch of simulated people and doing things for them like designing really cool houses and stuff like that. The game allows you to use your imagination and it teaches you how to mange money. I have been using THE SIMS for a year and I still really enjoy it. Most games that I play begin to get boring after a few months. I recommend this game to the teens out there who not yet tried it."
5,THE SIMS IS THE BEST!,"Ok, I wanted to give House Party a 7 out of 5 possible stars, but that's impossible. That's how good I think H.P. is. The Throw Party and Caterer options are awesome, as well as some of the new window and wallpaper designs...at KillerSims, there's even a TELEPORTER instead of stairs! The Sims House Party was the coolest game, I think......"
3,~*The Sims House Party*~,"The sims house party is the expansion of the sims and the sims livin' large. The main feature of the game is to have parties and if they are a dud, the infamous ""MIME"" will come and visit, and try to cheer your guests up. If the party is a success then you will have famous stars coming to visit. The only one I know is Drew Carey and belive me, the sims are mighty impressed from his limo to his personality. In the sims house party you will find a lot of additional objects, skins, wallpaper, windows, etc. It's a lot of fun! Go on and try it!"
3,"Great fun, but watch out parents!","This game is a cool add-on to the Sims, but I was a little shocked at some of the material in the game. I bought the game for my twin ten year-old boys as a birthday gift, thinking it would be appropiate for them since the original Sims was.Some things I was upset with were the dancing cages, Dancer in the Cake, hookah (which I wasn't too upset about, but it's still might upset other parents) That's all I found, but I would think twice if you're purchasing this for someone under 13.I'm not accusing this game of being evil or anything, I think it is very fun and enjoyable, but just watch out, parents! As for the older kids, the game is ""da bomb""."
5,The Best,This is probably the best computer game for kids. There are many ways this relates to life and it keeps them busy for hours!!
2,*Da Bomb!!!*,"Anyone who says house party is a piece of junk.. is totally wrong!! This is the best game in the whole computer history!! Not only can you create people, edit their personality and more, this game has everything you need to make the best party ever!! It has a costume trunk, where you can choose anything from togas and more, It has awesome new styles in clothing and it has houses with themes, for example you can build a hawaiian house and more, It has the option to just talk to other neighbors over the phone, It has dance floors, and dj boothes, a electronic rodeo thing, and my personal fave: the dance cages!! It's the best way to get your sims friends and it is the best sims game in all of sims history!! buy it fast!!"
3,Good but not Great,"It's an expansion pack I wouldn't skip, but then again I won't skip any expansion pack. Only a few more items, flooring, clothes, and that's about it. I'd get it, if only for the cake dancers, new party furniture, haunted house set and western set. It's... pretty good."
2,sims house party ....,"this expansion pack [is really bad]! the livin large one was great but this one has nothing more than music and food. the dancers u can higher dont take off NONE of their clothes and u cant higher more than one entertainer at a time. the things that ARE good in this game are a birthday cake,punkin and the campfire.and also the all girl and all boy bathroom. once u buy the birthday cake, you are already starting a birthday party, u can choose who's birthday it is that day. this expansion pack doesnt come with the vibromatic heart bed either. when u get the sims house party you will feel like you are playing the original sims."
2,Sims House party,To tell you the truth it sucked.The items are cool(bubble chair ect.....)But you could hardly build a good home if you already have a full house with many other items.And the partys are confusing because to many people come and you have no clue who you are meeting!
1,Horrible,"It looked so cool, but when I got it, I was queit dissapointed! the sims got home at 1, and it takes up lots of memory. I have it intsalled, but I don't throw parties. it is a stupid expansion pack. MARK MY WORDS! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT! What Maxis needs is new jobs!"
3,An okay game,"This game beats Livin Large by a blow. Livin large was not very fun and really is not worth 30 dollars. As for house party, If you are good at this game you might get some people to have fun at the parties. Its hard. I enjoyed this game though. I recommend Hot Date for anyone thas looking for the best expansion pack. Dont get me wrong, House party is an exceptional expansion pack. It is not, however, what i expected."
1,CRASH,The expansion pack crashes everytime try to run it. Had to de-install. No customer support. It might be fun - IF you can get it to run.
4,The Sims 3,The Sims 3 is a fun game and has fun new stuff like a telaporter (I prefer stairs because they are faster) but if you think the sims is kind of boring i dont think you shoud get it. (if you do like The Sims you will have lots of fun with the sims 3
3,Nice,I dont know how the game is or anything but I didn't notice that the it was an expansion pack so I didnt purchase the sims orginial game so I can play the game.
4,A great Game ( Sorry about the typos),"I'm a major sims fan i now own 4 of them. House party was great much like all of them. In house party you have the choice to buy cool lights like the floor lights in disco and wall lamps too. you can also buy a Dj's stand and tones of speckers to fill your house with tunes. Also you can have celebertys come to your house, for example i had drew carrey come once. but most of the time only mimes will come. you can them your partys too you can have tropical, hodown, disco and future. This game comes with tons of new wallp[aper and floors. there are also bong like buble blowers and stripe like people you can buy. Any way this game rocks the house."
2,This is the least intriguing expansion pack,"Don't buy this expansion pack, it's not worth the money. As much as I love The Sims, I believe that this was a way of making us buy the leftovers from Livin' Large. If you are going to buy any expansion pack, try Livin' Large, and Hot Date. Note: I have not yet tried Vacation."
4,"Great book, worth the work","This book is a one of the books that has changed how I think about the world. As I study how religion and people interact, this book gives a framework to work within. At times the material is clearly written for other professors and professionals. But dispite the work it takes to get thru some of the material, the content is very valuable. This book is having the same kind of impact for me that ""Diffusion of Innovation"" had."
4,"Lots of info, only slightly disappointed","This book does have a lot of questions,but I was disappointed to find that there are no math review questions. Although I haven't taken the boards yet, I would definitely study more than just this book. It seems to have a lot more questions on CNS and PET than needed and not a whole lot of review on Thyroids."
3,Cheese,There was a good amount of cheese in the 80's. This was no exception. But a truly enjoyable movie. The creativity of this time period is sorely missed.
5,New DVD is 16:9 Enhanced,"The new Lionsgate Lost Collection DVD *IS* definitely 16:9 enhanced. All the other titles in the collection are full-screen, but HIDING OUT is, rest assured, 16:9."
5,Jon Cryer is one of my favorite actors!,"Hiding Out is incredibly funny, action-packed, and of course, full of Jon Cryer! It's definately a must-see for all you 80's teen-flick lovers! I really wish this film would be re-released on video--I would definately buy it."
4,Fantastic movie!,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I thought I would purchase Hiding Out and I'm glad I did.It has just enough of everything to entertain the viewer - violence, comedy, romance, and a high school election - and also enough to make you want to watch again and again."
5,Hiding Out,"This was one of John Cryer's funniest movies. This wasn't the geartest story ever told, but it was fun to watch, light hearted and entertaining."
5,Hiding Out,"I bought this tape for my sister because she absolutely loved the movie. I have never seen it, but I plan on borrowing it to look at."
5,Awesome Seller,The product was better than stated and arrived very quickly. Would absolutely recommend this seller to others and would use them again.
3,Don't take it serious or expect a lot...but good light fun,It might be the timing when it came out or maybe I relate with something but I really enjoy watching this. I have seen it several times and I'll watch it again. I guess it is unrealistic but it is fun to watch and Jon Cryer and the others in the cast are likeable. As far as a well made film....well I guess it gets few stars but fun to watch? Well for me I give it 4 stars. So I average it and give it 3 here.
3,Good example of mass media leftism,"I know what you must be thinking: what the h*ll is he talking about? I'm not talking about the movie in general, which is OK, but rather a specific scene in which a teacher tries to brainwash kids into thinking Nixon was a great president. Come ON. Have you ever known a teacher like that? Of course not. The brainwashing from high school teachers comes from the other side of the political spectrum. That scene is a good example of the insidious left-ness of Hollywood.Anyhow, watch the movie, it's pretty entertaining, but be alert for covert political messages."
5,Excellent overview of Global Warming sources etc,Excellent overview of Global Warming sources and proposed solutions. Great educational value and not politicized like some of the stuff out there.
1,Italy NOT in the ETO,"If you're interested in anti-tank battalions in Italy, DON'T buy this book. I wanted to read about my uncle's 349th anti-tank battalion, 88th Division in Italy, and it is not discussed in this book, nor is any other division which fought in Italy. I was more than upset."
5,The best one yet,This is my favorite of the 3. My 1 and 2 yr olds sing and dance to this all the time. You'll find yourself listening to it even when the kids aren't around. You'll also find yourself singing them when they aren't even playing. Can't wait for the next one.
5,Kids music never had it so good,"My girls (ages 3 and 18 months) love this CD. It always makes car trips go by faster. And I'll admit, when one of these songs come up on shuffle on my iPod, I'll still listen to it, even if the kids aren't with me. The music is that good. Our favorite songs are ""Shakable You"" ""Seven Days a Week"" and ""Farm"" (The roosters are tired!) It's in that rare category of kids music of being just as good for girls or boys and their parents can like too!"
2,Uncomfortable,"It's a fairly lightweight sunglass, but you can't hardly tell from the picture that it's not a smooth wrap lens, which is what I thought it was. Instead it's a somewhat ugly lens which is creased in the middle, and it's striking to see when you get it. It takes away from the cool look it could have had if it was a bubble or wrap lens. It also puts uncomfortable pressure on the bridge of my nose, so that after a little while, just after a few minutes of wearing, causes my nose to feel like it has pressure points on it and stuffed up. I hate irritating feelings on and in my nose, so I don't plan on wearing this again. I ordered another pair of sunglasses for about $18 which I got today, and it has no rubber nose pads, just a cheap plastic thing, and I feel perfectly fine with them except I think I feel a slight residual pressure feeling from the bolle sunglasses I'm reviewing here from having worn them for hours, yesterday, but not yesterday night. I intend to return it."
1,Only one side worked!,"Right out of the box only one side worked. Not worth returning so theygot their $$, but I found them to feel cheap and pretty much just threw inthe recycling dumpster. Don't want to throw anything electronic in a Landfill. Don't bother with this product."
1,where is the sound,"what a cheap,worthless,piece of useless junk headphones i have ever seen. waste of money. just throw them straight in the trash. dont even bother to open the package. what a downer...you can barely hear any sound at all. give me a break. these aren't worth 15 cents. the only reason it gets one star is because i cant give it a zero."
2,Why can't I hear?,"My doctor indicated to me that I have a hearing deficiency. He suggested headphones for amplifying sound. I purchased these after reading the reviews and I heard nothing, in fact my hearing was worse. People shouted at me when I wore them around the house and around town. The instructions that came with them were very basic. I even tried holding the end of the cord close to people's faces and nothing. It just muffled life around me. I will move on to earbuds."
2,Lots of buzzing,I thought these were a bargain but have never been happy with this. A lot of buzzing/noise in the phones no matter what I play. I will be replacing them soon and would have long ago if I'd had the money.
3,Hard on headphones,"I like these headphones, especially the fact that they are inexpensive. I am very, very hard on headphones; therefore I must replace them frequently. I have tried more expensive models which don't stand up that much better, so I'm sticking with the Koss headphones."
3,Good for the price,I bought these to use with my labtop. The sound is good. The padding is not as soft as I had hoped. It feels a little rough on my ears. For the price I paid these are very worth it though.
3,OK for the price,"Your basic inexpensive headphones. Four foot cord is too short- presumably targeted for portable music players, but bad for connecting to a desktop computer or anything else that is more than a few feet away. Sound is good, but bass response is rather weak.On my pair, one of the drivers has an annoying metallic rattle at certain frequencies, nearly constant at higher volumes. I paid something like $7 for these, so it's not even worth the hassle of setting up a return.I chose these because I like the style- I don't like ear buds or behind-the-head headphones, and I needed something for casual use. I also have a set of Koss PortaPro headphones (~$40) which are excellent. In retrospect, I would recommend spending the extra cash for a set of PortaPros (not the SportaPro), or the Sennheiser P-100."
4,"Good Sound, Low Volume","They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9. If you have a high output player or a computer, these will be great, but if your using them for a low output or old device, these probably won't cut the cheese."
2,Koss headphones,The Koss headphones created a lot of attenuation to the input audio. The Sony MDR-AS20J Active Style Headphones with Soft Loop Hangers (Black)provides better audio at lower volume level. I do not recommend the Koss.
2,Cheap & Poor Quality Headphones,I have had these headphones for less than a year now. The right side no longer puts out any sound and they have always been uncomfortable. I only kept them as I couldn't find something I needed right in the store. I should have just ordered a different pair and returned these.
3,cheap,these particular headphones were very very cheap. the sound went out of one ear. wouldnt reccommend
1,Worst. Headphones. EVer.,"Ok, let me first say one thing. The sound quality of the KPH/6 headphones are great...until about 3 months later when the left ear dies. I've had 3 pairs of the exact same model. Same result in roughly the same timeframe. I am not hard on my headphones, unless you count 7 or so hours of daily use being hard on them. I don't crimp the cords, I don't even wrap them. Yes, they're cheap but the money adds up. Don't buy the KPH/6's."
1,OK for the Price,"I recently bought these headphones as for a low cost replacement set for the office. Although they were very low priced at $5, I find them to be dissapointing all the way around. They feel brittle when adjusting, grab your hair, feel itchy and uncomfortable and the cord is very thin. The worst aspect is that the volume control only allows you to adjust it a small amount. So if you're on a PC you still have to use the computer to adjust or mute the sound."
2,NOT KPH-6,"If you search on Amazon for the Koss KPH-6 headphones, these (KPH-5) model appear.They are essentially the same headphones, however, the KPH-6 model has an inline volume control. When these popped up as the result of my search for the KPH-6 I didn't notice that Amazon had substituted the model number, and mistakenly ordered several of this model. Since the price is so low I am going to donate these to a local non-profit that can put them to good use and buy the model I was originally looking for at my local Wal-Mart."
5,ear phones,"I bought these for my class, they loved them. Some of the teachers want to buy some from me. Referred this website to them."
4,Good and Inexpensive Headphones - Recommended,"We needed a pair of inexpensive replacement headphones for my dad to use with his portable DVD player and found these at a local ""big box"" store. They are comfortable and sound good to my untrained ear but we are using these for movies and not music, so our audio requirements are not too demanding. Audiophiles will likely be disappointed.The headphones are fairly light and I expect that they will not hold up too well over time, but at this price I will likely just buy another pair when these stop working.Recommended based on performance for the price.CFH"
3,Hmm...,"I buy cheap headphones to save money, so I honestly don't expect the greatest quality from them.I liked how nicely these headphones fit on my head. The cord is a bit shorter than what I like, but I can adapt.However, the biggest turn off about this product is how low the volume is. I have to put my laptop volume on max to really get a nice sound, otherwise it's WAY too soft.Pros: Lightweight, comfortableCons: Sound quality, sound volume"
4,Good Battery,When I purchased this from the company I was very happy as the money saved was almost 40% less then buying them at the local store. I started to use these and they would not wirk. I went to my Dr where I bought the hearing aids and they informed me that the batteries were to blame. I contacted the company and had a new package deliverd to me in 2 dats at no cost. I sugest checking the experation date when you receive the product. The company made it right and I am now a happy customer who will continue to buy from the company.
4,Been buying these for years! Work great!,"I now use two different size batteries: these 10s and 312s(for another aid).I really don't have anything to compare them with--in terms of life--but they have done the job quite well. And, most importantly, I keep coming back."
4,Great price!,Great price and they haved worked great so far. Are a little tighter in my hearing aid than others --but that is a good thing-they do not fall out when opening the aid.
3,"You get what you pay for, but great deal for the price","I am always looking for a good deal on batteries for my hearing aids. When I saw the price on these I thought it was too good to be true, but had to buy them to test them out myself. I found that the battery life on these batteries is not as good as the brand that I usually buy. I have been having to change the batteries every 3-4 days. However, at this price I would definitely buy them again because they are at least half the cost of what I have paid for other brand name batteries. Therefore, while its annoying having to change them more often, the savings is worth it."
2,not all of the batteries work,I was pleased with the price and delivery. However many of the batteries have not worked. I guess I should have stuck with a name brand.
2,Not recommended,"I will be placing my 3rd order for these and I have had no problems with them. As others stated it takes a few moments for them to ""power up"", but other than that they are fine. Anyone that said they don't last must be doing something wrong. On average they last the same 6-7 days that any other battery does. For the price even if they last a day less it is still a deal.Edit: I got a new pair of hearing aides that must use more power and these batteries were not usable. Many times my hearing aide would say the battery was low right after putting them in. Like I said it must have to do with the power output of these. I would recommend the power one batteries for new aides."
5,Good price,Good price for batteries that seem to last as long as more expensive hearing aid batteries.
5,Hearing aid batteries,Good and fast deal. Item as described. These batteries last exactly as long as the expensive ones my audiologist sells for three times as much. Thanks
2,Not impressed,"I am getting one or two days from these. Previous batteries have given 4-5 days of service. In addition, although not a deal breaker for me, the tabs are quite short and difficult to manage."
5,Great value,"My wife and I both use these batteries, and couldn't be happier with them. We get a week from each one. She uses 2 and I use 1. That's 20 weeks worth of hearing our grand-children for about $12. Not shabby."
1,Stuck,This product is manufactured poorly. The batteries are very difficult to remove from hearing aids. Many of the batteries only last a few minutes. I have discontinued use and will dispose of 90 of the 120 purchased. I will not purchase this item again. I have purchased from two other manufactures without any problem.
5,A Magical Unique CD,"I found this CD in the trunk of my car. Since both my sons are in the music business (one a musician and one a music journalist), I know one of them left it there. It was exciting to truly ""discover"" this recording.The cover and liner notes are amazing...done in four languages, but perfectly comprehensible. There are 20 tracks on the CD and each one unique in its own way. I was so looking forward to writing to Mr. Schorer and was incredibly saddened to hear he has died...far far too early. But what a gift to have left us. Thank you."
5,Bought after a single hearing,"I heard this once in an office and decided I should make a note of what it was. It stayed with me, and two days later I bought it.It's just fiddle music and only a single fiddler - Oliver Schroer. The style of the music is closest to a film score, rather than what I would assume traditional fiddling sounds like (I don't know), or what folk or classical music sounds like from what I've heard.It's atmospheric and for the most part celebratory.Production values are fine especially considering how it was recorded - if you google the artist you'll find his page.It's a very consistent record so if you like any part of it you'll likely enjoy all of it.I recommend it, it's pretty cool.I mostly listen to popular music like Fallout Boy and Tokyo Police club, newer Radiohead, Everything But The Girl, Coldplay, K-OS, and Thievery Corporation, and everything else from time to time."
4,Good results,"I was pleased with the results, I have been using the product for a month and cleared up the bumps on my chest rather quickly, within two weeks. The bumps left on my face are gradually going away as should be expected. Good product, highly recommend."
2,"Works at first, then dies","I ordered this product back when it was about $140 and let me tell you it was money well wasted. The product worked at first, then slowly stopped working, pretty soon I had more zits after I was done with the 2 months supply than before I started it! Not only that, any excess product that I wiped off my hands with a towel totally bleached them."
3,Rough Around The Edges,"The individual songs are fantastic, but the concert is arranged horribly and the lead-out from one song and the lead-in to the next in several places is harsh, diminishing the overall value of this product."
4,One of Nightwish's best,"I think that ""End Of An Era"" is one of Nightwish's best. I have not quit listening to it since I bought it through Amazon. The female vocals are great. This is one of the few Finnish metal bands that I listen to. The price was right and the delivery was fast and cheap. That is one of the reasons that I always buy from Amazon."
1,Review for this listing only - this is Brazillian knockoff,"I have only recently begun to collect Nightwish. I started with the American Nuclear Blast 2CD+DVD issue of End of an Era but for the most part have been collecting European Spinefarm issues - I have the Spinefarm 1997-2001 collection which I purchased from Amazon, I have the 8 track Spinefarm issue of Bless the Child and I have the Spinefarm 2CD+DVD of Highest Hopes. What I received from Amazon for this listing was not the Spinefarm issue but a Brazillian knockoff from NEMS Enterprises. It may be legitimate or it may not, but it isn't what is listed here and it makes me angry."
4,Their best live album,"Tarja certainly went out with a bang. This album is phenomenal. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because this is an experience best had by watching the DVD. Once in a while you may turn to the live album. But by the end of any track on this double disc set, you'll be turning on the TV so that you can watch while you listen. Regardless, this is not an experience to be missed."
3,Great CDs if I could enjoy them all,"When I got the CD the case came cracked , It didn't really bother me because for all I know it could have been the delivery guy no the senders . I quickly put the CD in my stereo to listen to the amazing thing that is Nightwish . The first CD worked fine , but when I put the second CD in it starting skipping at ""Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan"" and just didn't work at all after that. I can understand how a case can crack by a delivery accident but how can the CD get ruined so much that it won't even work?"
5,Excellent book,"I wish I'd read this as a child, its superb. I think its a must read for certain kids. The most helpful book I've come across without a doubt."
5,Making a difference for us already,"I got this book about a week ago when my seven-year-old daughter started expressing anxiety that my husband would not pick her up after school. It was to the point where she would not get out of the car at school. We have gone through about half of the book and are already seeing a huge improvement.What I like about this book is that it actually gives the child tools to use to deal with their worries and anxieties. It is funny and very easy to read. Not to mention completely ""dead on"" which in some ways is reassuring because you know that others have faced the same problems.We are using the ""worry time"" technique as well as the ""worry bully"" flicking off the shoulder. I am greatly encouraged, and so grateful to have found this book. I highly recommend it!!"
3,What to Do When You Worry Too Much: A Kid's Guide to Overcoming Anxiety (What to Do Guides for Kids),"My son is 10 1/2 and has issues with anxiety. I thought this would help from all the great reviews it received. I think it is a good book but is better suited for slightly younger children. He read it all at once. I asked him did he feel it was going to help him. He said, ""No, it really didn't talk about any of the things that I feel nervous about."" ""I'm not really afraid of dogs."" I told him that he should be able to use the information he learned when they discussed dogs in his own situations. But, it doesn't seem to have made any difference with him. I think he just felt it was quite babyish and therefore it made him disinterested."
4,I was worried my almost 11 year old...,"would think this simple book was beneath him but he liked it -he did not do any of the activities but he was receptive to listening. We went over it in one night in about 30 minutes (it is very short- many pictures) but he has wanted the allocated ""worry time"" of about 15 minutes every night since."
5,Great book!,"I think ""What to Do When You Worry Too Much: A Kid's Guide to Overcoming Anxiety"" is a wonderful book. It has simple exercises for kids to do to help them overcome their anxiety, and it is an easy, fun read. The information provided explains things so that kids can understand it and apply it to their lives. I'm really glad I purchased this book!"
5,Must have for parents,"This book is an excellent resource for parents who have a child with anxiety or suspect there is anxiety going on. It is well-written, easy to understand and offers suggestions on how to proceed for your child."
5,Best Self-Help Book for Anxious Kids,"I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker specializing in the treatment of Anxiety Disorders in children. I have been using all of Dr. Huebner's books in my practice. I highly recommend What to Do When You Worry Too Much: A Kid's Guide to Overcoming Anxiety (What to Do Guides for Kids.) This book introduces CBT concepts in a friendly, easy to understand manner. I find that kids and parents both enjoy reading the workbook. The drawings and activities are fun and promote behavioral change. I run a CBT group for anxious children and use many of the activities in my group. Kids have a blast creating their worry bully and bossing it back! Also, for parents, I recommend Ron Rappe's book, Helping Your Anxious Child, Second Edition, which has a downloadable workbook for parents or therapists to use with children."
5,Worked wonders!,"I bought this for my 6 year old who was having increased anxiety to the point of crying daily when separated. After doing this workbook and following through for a week, we have a completely new child. She still has the worries, but they are much more manageable. I would highly recommend as a first step - this is more of a workbook than book that we did together. I would recommend reading on your own before doing with your child; some of the ideas seem harsh before you totally understand the whole premise."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"My five year old son has been very anxious since starting Kindergarten last month. He had separation anxiety and would cry several times a day at school. I knew he was adjusting to his new routine, but then he started getting anxious about going to school and would ask, ""Mommy, what if I cry? I don't want to cry at school."" So I found this book on Amazon and was 'sold' when I saw all of the wonderful reviews. I started reading it to my son the day I received it. My son couldn't believe that this book was describing exactly how he'd been feeling. As I read it, I noticed he was hanging on my every word. There are wonderful ideas and he's so excited to start using them. This morning before school he even said, ""Mommy, I don't think I'm going to cry today."" So, I highly recommend this book. I know how heart-wrenching it is to watch your little one suffer with anxiety. Best of luck!"
5,"Excellent book, excellent adjunct to therapy!!",This book is absolutely wonderful. I have used it numerous times as an adjunct to therapy. Terrific assignments that really target the core issues. Well written and entertaining too!
2,I found this one disappointing,"The idea is a good one -- to explain anxiety at a level that most kids can understand and give them some steps to take to help them overcome their worries. Unfortunately, at one point in the book, the author makes the point that worries pick on weak people. What? If you purchase this book, you're trying to help your child cope with worry, not scold them for being too weak to conquer it."
5,anxious kids an amazing find,This is a fantastic book that actually works!! My kid is 8 and has serious anxiety I will recommend this book to anyone who has a child that is stressed to the point its unhealthy
4,Good book,I use this book in a clinical setting with young readers who need a fresh relatable way to understand certain behaviors. This book allows easy reading for age appropriate readers and a great conversational way to address things young people go through
5,Excellent Tool for Getting Kids to Understand Anxiety,Our six-year-old has struggled with anxiety for several years. This workbook has been a valuable tool in getting her to understand what anxiety is and how she can develop coping skills to deal with her anxieties so that they don't stop her from doing the things she wants to do.
5,Provides great tools for a child's worry,"Our 10 year old daughter was consumed by worry & fear over things that were way out of the realm of possibility to us. This book helped her evaluate her fear, put a face to it, and helped her contain her worries in a healthy way. It provided her with several tools to deal with the anxiety, and instead of the worries getting beyond her control, she controls them. We thought it might be too much of an ""easy reader"" for her, but not so. Because the language is simple, she was able to grasp the concepts easily and begin using the tools from day one. There are pages for the child to write in responses to questions, a page to draw what their ""fear monster"" looks like, making it their own private guide book. Would recommend this book."
3,"Ending was good, but story was a bit silly for me","The beginning of the book really captured me. However, once the three women from The Pale Horse were visited and their story began to unfold, I lost interest. The fact that the main character and the vicar's wife actually somewhat believed the three women's ""power"" could be responsible for the murders was silly. I did not like the in-depth description of the seance at all. The whole thing was ridiculous. But, I enjoyed Christie's classic twist in revealing the true murderer, and the ending was good. Overall, decent read, but not one of my favorites."
2,Kind of weird,"This was an odd story that didn't keep my attention as well as Christie's books usually do. There weren't very many suspects, and the mystery wasn't as engrossing as usual."
3,Didn't like the 'malevolent powers' references...,"This was a spooky book. There are a lot of mentions of 'malevolent powers' in the book, even though they are scoffed at by most of the characters. There are no famous Christie characters in this book, except a small part played by Ariadne Oliver. I have to laugh at Ms. Oliver, because as she discusses writing her murder mysteries, she may very well be expressing some of the frustration Ms. Christie felt at times while she was trying to write. Anyway, I did not like the spiritual references, but otherwise it was a great mystery with a great twist at the end."
2,A flop,"I am a big A.C.fan,but I am sorry to say that this was not up to her usual standards.The plot is far too vague and fanciful.If you want to read Christie,read her classic whodunits(Poirot,Miss Marple),don't read this rubbish."
3,"Well written, but missing something...","I have been a mystery lover for a long time, and knowing Christie's genius for a quality mystery, I hoped that THE PALE HORSE was a great book. But, it was rather mediocre. Though the idea of a list of names, seemingly unconnected, was found on a murdered man was quite surprising, it didn't turn out as well as I hoped. There were too little suspects, and the characters weren't very charismatic."
4,The 60's a la Christie,"It's the early sixties in what will soon be known as Swinging London. Mentions of Teddy boys, stove pipe pants and coffee bars help establish the ambience. I mention this, because some of Christies other forays into youth culture of the sixties (The Third Girl, for example) seem uninformed and inauthentic. This one is much more successful, probably because the narrator candidly describes himself as old-fashioned.Seemingly unrelated deaths are related, and the means is quite clever. Peripheral characters are drawn more vividly than the young male narrater, but the pacing is good. With so many mystery writers intent on writing Literature--which seems to demand a tome of 400 pages at minimum--it is refreshing to have such an enjoyable read in under 200.Yet even with an economy of means, Agatha Christie makes interesting general observations about the criminal mind and the nature of evil."
5,Great Shooping,The shoes material is confortable and disign. The colors is as descrived in the advertasing and I am happy to have a Sperry shoes whit the quality that been made.
2,They ain't what they used to be,Purchased shoes in late May 2010. Did not wear them until mid 2011. Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear. Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop(tm). Did not work. Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair. I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart. The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles (over many years). In other words normal wear. The latest pair very prematurely failed. Shipped them back to Sperry (at my expense) for evaluation. I don't expect much.
1,If the shoe fits....,"I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years, always size 9.5. These shoes arrived, marking inside said 9.5, but there was no chance they would fit. Too small....return. Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5, they arrived yesterday, them fit fine."
1,Garbage!,Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked. It's like there extremely old and dry rotted. Will never buy sperrys through amazon again.
2,"Looks Nice, But....","These shoes are very uncomfortable. I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine. If support is what you need in footwear, search elsewhere."
2,Not like my old ones,"Disappointing is the word I'd use to describe this purchase. I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old. They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft. Also, there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them. I've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem."
4,Deck Shoe,"Shoe is nice but was disapointed that the dye from the shoe gets on my socks,it was suprising as my feet do not sweat. This is not a good thing.Will not consider this color next time..."
5,Sperry Deck Shoes,Great price and free shipping for Speery Top Sider Boat Shoe.The price was cheaper than any retail outlet with a large selection of colors. I highly recommend using Amazon for future shoe buys.
4,Sperry Top- Sider boat shoes,i have used these shoes for years and they work very well in casual situations. They were shipped promptly and were in perfect condition..
3,Received wrong size,"The shoe that I received looked fine, but it did not fit as well as the one it replaced that I purchased in a brick and mortar store. It seemed a bit larger. I did not realize until I had worn it out a few times that the width was W (wide) and not M (medium) the size that I ordered. I will keep them and hope that with socks they will be ok. I have never ordered shoes by mail, because I did not want to have to go through the return process if something was not right. Unfortunately, it happened the first time and I didn't even realize that the order was filled incorrectly. This order was not fulfilled by Amazon, but by Shoebuy. I buy a lot from Amazon and will continue. Though, I do not think I will buy clothes or shoes by mail anymore."
3,"Very sexy, not too comfortable","I got these shoes hoping to wear them to work, wanting to replace a pair of Rockport topsiders that are starting to wear out. The sole on these isn't really great for standing for 8 hours at a time, so now I just wear them for going out."
4,Classic Topsiders,"This is the classic, original boat shoe. Everythings fine, except the laces do not look right until they are ""broken In.'"
5,So easy to order these shoes!,"I needed shoes for my husband - they are a replacement of the exact ones he had worn out. He wanted the same ones. I knew I didn't have time to go looking in a few stores for the exact shade and size, so, voila! Amazon.com to the rescue! The shoes are perfect and my husband loves them....no wasting gas and my time to track down the exact same shoe!!!!!"
3,US Sizing not clearly explained,"Hi, we purchase clothing and shoes from all over the world and only the US is significantly different.The US sizes are much smaller and this was not obvious on this web site.Other retailers around the world advise which sizing range is used, including some via Amazon.Or, they clearly marked which country sizing they were using.It should be clear on the website which sizing the retailer is using.On the plus side, the shoes were delivered as ordered, on time and in good condition.RussellAustralia"
1,"""Wide"" isn't wide at all!","Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe. In fact, the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot, felt like my foot was being squeezed. Returning this shoe immediately. Also, didn't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets! Very disappointed!!"
4,Ok,This shoe appeared damaged (or worn) so we had to return it. Took a while to get return handled from marketplace supplier. Not a fan of sperry though - too boxy.
3,As advertised but disappointed,Boat shoes. Brown. Do not wear on anything slippery unless you want to fall. Somewhat comfortable but they feel very thin. I guess boat shoes are like this but i have worn other sperrys that feel better and safer.At least they look pretty good and seem well made.
5,Great shoe,Very good experience ordering from Amazon.com which went through a sub-contractor. But I have worn Sperry Top Siders for more that 40 years now and have never gotten a flawed pair of shoes. They are the highest quality of all boat shoes.
5,Great casual shoe for land and sea,"I'm a Sperry Top-Sider fan. A great shoe for casual dress or boating activities. Quality, fit, comfort, looks....all there, pure and simple. A great product!"
5,Great Summer Shoes,"I've been a Top-Siders fan for years. The shoe does have an excellent grip on wet surfaces. The look is also great and they are comfortable. The price on this purchase came in less than other sites, arrived on time and in good condition. Overall, a great buying experience."
4,great pair of shoes,I have a wide foot so I was a little nervous buying them online. I got them and sure enough they were tight. After a couple of times wearing them they broke in and now they're the most comfortable shoe I own.
5,Men's Sperry Top-Sider,"Excellent service! Before you click anywhere else, check out theprice and service here!"
3,Unable to rate.,"I ordered the Sperry Women's Eye Sahara and received the ""Men's"" model.I returned them and tried to reorder the women's style and was advised by your Help Chat Room ""Don't order this item."" ""Look at Reviews"""
1,Not good,"This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart...the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up, Get another one.."
5,He LOVED it!!!,"Bought these shoes for my husband for no reason but to show my love to him. He was very surprised because they are his most favorite shoes. His old ones wore out from years of usage. Once my husband put them on, our son (12 yrs old) wanted a pair! Now my husband will finally wear shoes instead of flip flops on those rainy days!Shipping was a lot quicker then the estimated & they were a lot cheaper than the stores!!!"
4,"Comfortable then, comfortable now","I've been wearing topsiders since 1974 as casual footwear, as bedroom slippers, and even as gardening shoes. My only complaint is that not all colors are available in all sizes. Other than that, it is my shoe of choice and always will be."
5,Great Shoes!,"After wearing these Boat Shoes for two weeks, I must confess, that these are the most comfortable and good looking shoes, I've ever owned. I love them so much, I went to a Sperry outlet store and purchased another pair in Brown.I highly recommend these shoes! I paid a little more for the second pair [not purchased through Amazon], but the results were the same."
5,The Power to get in,"This book has changed my sales career. The ease and common sense, which is supplied, has provided me with an almost flawless method to getting into today's largest corporations. My success rate with the power letter is 95% Plus. I get calls back from SVP's who ask me when the best time for me to meet with them. I amaze my boss. He calls me and says, get us an appointment with XYZ company, and in a matter of days I have the appointment. This book is a must for any sales person that needs to gain access to key decision makers in today's e-mail and phone mail business environment. I will be presenting this selling style to over 600 sales people at our national sales meeting this January. If you want to see dramatic success in gaining access to the key decision-makers in today's largest organizations get this book.Buy Michael Boyland's Power to get in. And make it your new secret weapon."
3,What if everyone did it?,"Mr. Boylan's idea is well thought-out and makes a great deal of sense. Furthermore, he provides fascinating examples of success using his ""Circle of Leverage"" technique. However, this technique smacks of a manipulative gimmick that will frequently fail if it is widely implemented. The more people use it, the more often executives will instantly recognize it and develop their own countermeasures. It seems likely that shortly someone will write a successful best-seller entitled, ""The Power to Keep them Out!"""
1,Pure Junk,"This book is pure fiction and pure junk. Much of the book tells you what you allready know, it is difficult to get in. Then it spends a lot of time ellaborating on things you shouldn't do, things noone in their right mind would do anyway. Then it gives you advice that is absolutely absurd. The author is a phoney, and you will agree when you get the book. The reviews listed here are great...."
1,Typical Salesmen/Author,"As is typical of the Salesman Author, Boylan spends more time and effort selling his method than telling us about it. We are in the fourth chapter by the time he even begins to get to the meat of the subject.Boylan's Massive Ego (don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with a big ego in a salesman, but here it interferes with the product)shines through and clouds his vision. We are told on every page that his method is the only method that works and that we should keep reading. Remove all the hype, and you have a few short sentences we all already know about.1.) Do your research.2.) Start as high up in the chain of command as you can.3.) 1 helps you do 2.Overall, a very poorly written, overly self complimentary work."
2,Fluffed Up to Fill a Book?,"A senior sales executive once said to me, ""Steve, you sales trainers are all alike. You take 6 hours to make a 30 second point."" Unfortunately this is true of Boylan's book. The point he does make is his idea of creating 'leverage' by contacting your prospective buyer and at the same time contacting his boss, and his boss's boss - along with other 'leverage points.' While I agree that most sales people need to earn contact at higher levels in organizations, this isn't the way. It is the kind of technique that leads to the bad image most people have of sales people."
2,A Magazine Article Stretched into a Book,"Tell your audience what you are going to tell them; hint at what you will tell them; suggest at it; beat around the bush about it; .... well you get the idea,<Then tell them in 2 pages what it is>then tell them what you told them; then hint at it; then suggest it; then beat around the bush about it; .... well you get the ideaThis should have been a 2 page magazine article, not a book. Some good content to chew on in the two pages, but I would have rather have seen it in a magazine article than paying the price for paper, printing, publishing and shipping."
3,Good story!,"The video was pretty old - didn't play real well. But the story content was so good, that it was worth the price."
4,Magnetic Cactus Companion,"Quite an informative book. Wish I would have bought it from Amazon.Com! Lots of information on many of the vast amounts of Cacti. The growing tips were excellent. A must have if you are a ""cacti"" collector like myself."
1,'Most Wanted' - by whom????,"This book was reminiscent of those 'made-for-tv' movies of the late 80s - early 90s. Eek. Can we say predictable??? The romantic developement between the main characters was so blech... I mean, how many times was Dan going to say ADMIRINGLY to Melanie 'You're one tough cookie"" after she's articulated another bad idea or after she'd indulged in her favourite pastime of incessant whining???The plot was terrible. Slice's narration was particulary awful. Mz Martinez should've stuck to inserting bits of spanish dialogue in order to break up the monotony and left off trying to write 'street'. It was incredibly bad. I am stunned at the glowing reviews it's received here. Maybe they're talking about another book altogether????Sorry Mz Vargas, I'll bypass reading any more of your heroine's 'derring-do's'...."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"A potboiler. What can I say?The author, a Harvard alum, and federal prosecutor, creates a complex crime story which stretches credibiltiy far beyond limits. She tries to put many story lines into play; most of which are absurd. Her writing skills ( in terms of dialogue, human thoughts and emotions ) are minimal. How she got this published is a mystery. Out of 10 I am generously giving it a 4."
4,Perfect Combo of Suspense and Mystery,"Big wig Jed Benson is found shot, mangled and completely charred in his home office, the housekeeper badly beaten and Benson's young daughter missing several fingers. Prosecutor Melanie Vargas has stumbled into the biggest case of her life.Not only does the evidence point to arson and robbery but the group of perpetrators suspected of being responsible for the horrid crime are well-known for coming back to ""clean up"" any witnesses.Melanie must prove herself and her capabilities with this case. She needs to gather enough evidence to nail the perpetrators in court, protect the only two key witnesses she has and, oh yeah, there's also her cheating husband and unhappy marriage to deal with as well.The suspense, action and mystery that fill the pages of Most Wanted are captivating from the very first chapter. Michele Martinez has created a perfect combination of suspense and mystery with unforgettable and strong characters."
5,VERY surprised!,"I absolutely loved this book!! I've read them all....romances, thrillers, suspense, you name it..so I figured this book would be the same formula....boy meets girl, girl gets in trouble, boy saves girl. NOT at all!! I LOVED the main character and I love the idea that she is a strong woman who can take care of problems herself. I think what really clinched it for me was that the author was an attorney that also worked for the D.A.'s office so I felt that what she was writing could even be factual to a certain extent. I'm on my way to buying all her other books. I just need to read them in the right order. I can't wait!"
3,Did the audio version - Entertaining Crime Story,Nice to have a Hispanic heroine and that the men didn't dominate the heroics. Just wish Michele like many writers would get an education on firearms. Her description of what happened with the Glock that ran out of ammo is laughable. But then this particular area is a failing of many writers.
1,Most Wanted: Talent,"Eeeek. Don't quit your day job. This plodding, linear, unimaginative debut novel cries for a spark of creativity. The dialog is predictable and hackneyed, the scenes cliched, the arrogance of the heroine monumental. Back to the drawingboard this should go. One wonders if this reader had the same book as those rave-reviewers?"
2,Most Wanted...NOT!,"How did this get published?!? For someone who attended and graduated both Harvard and Standford Law Schools I expected the author to have a clue when it came to grammar. Is this really too much to ask?I could not make it through Chapter 5; it's only two pages long. I'm sure this is the killer's internal dialoge, but it would be nice to have sometype of prompting to that effect. Instead, the reader is plunge into writing that reminds me of reading ""Incidence Reports"" of D.O.C. juveniles! Yes, 12-18 year old kids with minimal education.Needless to say, I will never buy or even try to read anything else from this author. ""Most Wanted"" it is not!"
2,Too Preachy And Not Scientific Enough,"Ok like other people have said, this book does have some decent information in it, for people who know absolutely NOTHING about nutrition. However, as other reviewers have also said, the religious overtones in the book are a bit distracting, and some parts are completely pointless. For example, on the section of what foods to avoid he is talking about shellfish. Then, at the end of the section, he tells a story about how he turned on the TV one day and saw this minister talking about this little girl who had cancer and was dying, and was just sorry she couldn't support his cause (monetarily). Ok, it was a nice story but it had NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING to do with avoiding shellfish!! What the heck??So, overall I say avoid this book. There are plenty of books out there that are better and are more scientific."
2,Be Very Careful,"Yes, this book contains some worthwhile information. The problem is knowing what is worthwhile and what is questionable. While he raises good points about fiber consumption, he ends the chapter with advice about colon cleansing, along with an invitation to ""call my office"" for more information, something which appears in the book several times. There are also endorsements for a certain kind of water purification system. His biography lists degrees in ""science"" (?), business administration, biology, chemistry, psychology, and exercise physiology. He's also a ""licensed nutritionist"". OK, what's missing? The names of the universities that granted all of these degrees."
2,There are better books out there,"This book is very rudimentary and maybe has value for someone who knows absolutely nothing about nutrition. Most of the points are quite elementary, such as avoiding trans fats and high-fat dairy. Also, this book was written in 1999 so some of the information seems dated. Finally, some of his points are debatable, such as alcohol being bad for you in any form and fluoride being a killer. I do not recommend this book."
1,Don't waste your time,"This just goes to show that anyone can write a book on nutrition. (I have a bachelors degree in nutrition from a well-known university.) Who is this book good for? Those with little knowledge of nutrition, who have poor eating habits, and like an emotionally charged book to scare them into eating better. Who is it not for? Anyone who likes credible information backed up by facts. As he accurately states in his chapter Avoid the Concealed Dangers, ""... I feel like a cross-eyed discus thrower. I may not set any records, but I will definitely keep the crowd alert!"" Meaning, he totally misses to hit any marks by backing it up with plausible science, but he will keep your interest with emotional soapbox campaigning. Amazing!"
5,Eye opening!!!!!,This book let's you know how to get the Maximum energy in life and with foods. I was surprised at how much we eat on a daily basis is killing us. I am going to do what the book tells us and change my eating habits so I can live longer. This book was very informative and was easy to read.
4,02 Tundra Long Bed-Fit OK,"This was one of the only bed caps I could purchase. The plastic is not as thick as the bedliner, but its ok. I think its good enough to protect the bed rails. I gave 4 stars because it fits very well but the stake holes didn't line up. It was ok because I just cut the needed piece out on the bed caps and installed my anchor points over it. Had to cut with a small knife. The anchor points covered the cut plastic and stake holes completely so it wasn't that big of a deal. The 3M tape is pretty strong and thin, so the cap mounts more flush to the body. There is some excess plastic towards the truck cab end, but not very noticeable. The cap protects about 2.5 inches on the inside of the truck bed rail. With the bed liner, there's still some metal showing, but not very noticeable (about .25""). It would have taken about 10 minutes to install, but I had to cut the stake holes out so it took about 40 minutes."
4,They work,"My son is probably a little young at only a year to actually play with these. Mostly it is us showing him how they work. They are durable, he chews on them, and throws them in the tub. They were a gift from his grandma."
1,Do yourself a favor...,"...and not buy this product. This look cute at first, but like one reviewer said, the holes in the cups are too large and the water comes out too fast. It leaves you having to refill in less than 3 seconds after you fill it up. One cup has water coming out of it's mouth if tipped forward, but what was the point of putting a large hole on the bottom. Most of the water flows out for the bottom before I pour it out of the mouth. The point is having the kids pour the water out manually , and not by gravity. Also, it would be more fun if the water trickled out slower. Only one cup did that. My twin daughters who just turned two were not interested after day one. For $18, this toy is too pricey. I would not buy for $1 knowing this ahead of time. My wife went to target the other day and bought a toy watering pot for $2. it was so much more fun than these cups. The maker poorly executed a good concept."
5,we all love these,What kid doesn't like a cup in the tub. Mine does! So I finally got him these. He plays and plays with them.
3,"Good idea, but kids were bored","Because of the picture, I assumed (wrongly) that there were suction cups on the back of the cups to make them stick to the side of the tub...that way, the water would flow from each cup to the next. However, they are only hand held toys. My kids, 1 and 4, liked the cups that have lots of holes for a little while because they looked like a shower coming down, but they only played with them for about two or three bath sessions before they were completely bored with them. I thought this was a great idea, but the manufacturer just stopped short of entertaining my kids."
2,Not worth the high price of the DVD !,"First of all, Columbia-Tristar released a Shannon Tweed double feature for twenty dollars list price while charging this thirty dollars. Why is that?On to the story, Shannon Tweed is a cop investigating a serial killer who killed high price prostitutes. She ends up falling in love with the main suspect. Shannon only have a couple love scenes which are OK. The rest of the girls are quite beautiful. But if you expect to see a lot of Shannon you will be disappointed as her first naked scene appears at 43 minutes mark.The DVD is OK. The full screen picture is decent for this B movie and the sound track sounded like mono but again not much action in this one. Unless you are a diehard Shannon Tweed's fans who have to have this DVD right away, I would suggest you wait until the price drop or get a used copy as this one is not as good as Shannon Tweed's early movies."
4,Shannon delivers,"Plenty of softcore action and beautiful women. Best scene is with Playboy Playmate Katie Lohmann!! She is my all time favorite playmate, so I might not be an impartial judge, but you do get her in all her glory - FFN! And she is spectacular!! This dvd would have gotten 5 stars if they hadn't killed off Katie."
3,Just OK,"I actually bought this for a trial on my own hair which is naturally coarse, thick, and curly. I figured if it worked wonders on a horses mane and tail, it was worth a shot. Well it did not do anything for my hair really. I used the entire bottle and could tell no difference in the condition of my hair. The scent was pleasant enough. I can say it worked better as a detangler for me and that's about it. I'm glad I tried it though and will continue my search for the perfect conditioner for me."
3,Hooked on Art,The activities were a little more simplistic that I expected but there were some new ideas
3,"Another helpful book - ""On Your Own For The First Time""","For another lifesaver for the single mom....""On Your Own For The First Time"" by Jeff Bowers. For those mom's who find themselves having to do it ALL after years of having help, I found this book saved me on things I never knew and gave me great advice! What a guide, what a great tool!"
5,You haven't seen an anime drama until you've see this,"This anime is truly a masterpiece. Key is the god of anime dramas. I could go on and on about how great this show is, but I think you need to just see it for yourself :) If you love anime, this is a must see, as well as Clannad Afterstory. Another great show by Key is Kanon, try that too!"
2,Great but damaged case,Anime is absolutely great but my case came cracked I dod not pay that much for a damaged product. Not cool
3,Some shopping was said and done.,"I am a Japanese.Since it was high when he bought the same thing in Japan, it purchased here.It was cheap even if it included the mailing cost."
4,complete set 4 pc collection...????,"I was wondering, it says complete collection 4 pc. Does this mean this collection has both the Clannad 1, 2 and Afterlife 1 and 2? Is the movie included in this set? It says run time on amazon's description to be 600 minutes, seems kinda short to be a ""complete collection""."
2,I DON'T LIKE IT!,I think its bad becuase its very very very inapropriate. I like yaoi if you know what that is but I think it has yuri and I HATE YURI. :O
5,Outstanding Example of Anime,"Clannad is truly an amazing series. It addresses themes that most slice of life stories usually omit or gloss over. Its characters are unique and interesting and its setting is on the whole believable. It's a romance, a comedy, a drama, and more. I was incredibly happy that it also avoided the pitfall of becoming a ""harem"" anime. Combined with its sequel, ""After Story,"" it creates a beautiful story.As for the quality of the release itself, everything seems to be fine. The Blu-ray contains 3 discs and includes all 23 episodes of Clannad along with the Tomoyo OVA (which I love). I only have one minor complaint about this release and that is that the English subtitles are yellow. I infinitely prefer white subtitles."
2,Tore along seam after two months of use,"I am going to try to get a replacement ball from the manufacturer. It may just be that we got a bad ball, but I was very surprised when, after less than 2 months use, the ball developed a 1-inch+ tear along a seam. We can no longer use the ball."
2,"Air leak, disappointed","I used this ball for a couple months and before long it got a small puncture and leaked air. No way to repair according to SPRI. I wasn't particularly hard on the ball, but I didn't check the floor each time I used it either. I assumed it was more puncture resistant. I think it may have snagged on something. I would recommend the Elite ball, which is more expensive, in the SPRI line. The gym I go to uses the Elite ball and it looks much thicker. Why call this ball ""Professional Plus"" if it isn't all that durable?"
5,outasight,"If you enjoyed and survived the 60s, you'll meet the people you knew back then--alive and doing reasonably well--in the pages of Drop City. A fairly long book, it wasn't long enough, and long before it ended, I longed for the characters to last. Especially Star.I'm reading another good book now but it doesn't do it for me the way Drop City did."
3,Its alright,"This book is ok. i bought in on request of my friend who said it was great..you will only like it if you have a general appreciation for literature. it has no action, but halfway redeems itself with good writing and a mildly interesting plot...it becomes rather tedious reading it, and often repetitive."
5,READ THIS NOVEL,"I have never read anything by T.C. Boyle, and wow have I been missing out! This story was so well written I couldn't put it down. I work at Borders and have recommended it many times to customers looking for something good to read. The characters were so compelling and the landscape of the bay area and Alaska are intriguing."
4,"Great story, great characters, but an abrupt ending","I promise not to give away the ending. But I will say that the one thing I did not like about this book is the way that the final 4 or 5 chapters bring everything to such an abrupt conclusion. The book begins with masterful character development, a wry sense of humor, and a slow progression of plot. It ends with very little character study, no more humor, and story line conclusions that seem rushed and unfulfilling. That said, the book is still fantastic. It is one of the few books about the ""hippie generation"" that manages to convey the zeitgeist of the 70s without any of the silly nostalgia that plagues so much late 20th / early 21st century writing about the 60s and 70s. It also manages to beautifully interleave two very different versions of what it's like to ""live off of the land"" into a really great story. I loved this book. I only wish that Mr. Boyle had put as much effort into the nuances of the last 30% as he did into the first 70%."
3,Occasionally entertaining slice of commune life...,"Boyle has the most fun here when he forces his California-conditioned hippies to endure the endless winter of the Alaskan wilderness. It's an interesting premise, and occasionally it hits the mark, but it still leaves the reader feeling ""so what?"", because ultimately these are just a bunch of unlikeable layabouts. His descriptions are uniformly excellent, and one can't help but wonder whether he rather wasted them on the characters here, but Drop City is quite readable in a voyeuristic, zoo-type way.Better than a lot of counterculture portraits because it has its tongue firmly in its cheek, but unless you really care about selfish pothead pseudo-spiritualists and their helpless struggles you're not going to find the Great American Novel here."
5,"Love, love love it","When I finished reading DROP CITY,I started over again. I have enjoyed Boyle's short storiesand other novels, but DROP CITY went beyond anything else he's written.Boyle captures the good intentions and disgusting sexual attitude toward womenof the '60s. He does this with the right details, the lush, lyrical prose he'sknown for, and the tongue-in-cheek humor. Apparently the basis for this isa real commumne started in California that moved to Alaska. Not that it matters.Boyle made it real for me."
2,I've had enough of Boyle for a while,"I am so happy to finally be finished with this book.Boyle is a gifted and imaginative writer, but I really disliked most of the characters in this book and couldn't wait to put it down each day. I forced myself to continue with it because it's on the 1001 books you must read list.Drop City, the fictional one in this story, is a commune in California whose members decide - after a young girl is raped in their presence, and the authorities are cracking down on their lack of plumbing - to move to Alaska. The Drop City crowd quickly learns how ill-equipped they are for life, that the fantasy of living off of the land is, in reality, not for them. In the same way, I realized that the fantasy of being a hippie in the 60s perhaps would not have been my cup of tea. I quickly grew tired of the free-love, as Star, one of the hippie-chicks, figures out early on, is a better deal for the guys than the girls.I think I've had enough of Boyle for a while."
4,Best Book This Summer,"I read the second half of this book in one afternoon, I just couldn't put it down. T C Boyle will make you feel as if you are right in Drop City. You will feel the California sun beating down on you and the bitter below-zero cold that settles in come October. Would love to know what becomes of Pam, Sess, Star and Marco."
4,Thoroughly engrossing.,"I really enjoyed this book. It took me to other places, another time, and was not too depressing despite the harsh realities in each venue. I cared about the characters and saw hope for the ones that I sympathized the most with. This book was so good that I neglected housework and stayed up too late reading. It made me think about life, I tasted a slice of Baked Alaska (ha ha) and it was a great adventure! Bravo T. C. Boyle! I will try another one of his books to see if it can measure up to this one."
2,Waste of time,Didn't like anything about this book--not one character could I feel any empathy for or relate to in any was--couldn't wait for it to be over--It was my Book Club book. or I never would have taken the time to finish it.
3,"Clean, Concise, Good Enough","First TC Boyle book I've read. His mastery of literature shines through in the tight weaving of characters and curcumstances. The characters have enough depth to merit interest and the story weaves enough to be fun. I just could never shake the feeling that the book was just a long drawn out final rip on the hippie movement. The modern elitist perception that feigns a slight empathy while undercutting the results of all of the ideals. And I don't care much for the movement. It's just that this book was so concise and effective that it felt dishonest. Maybe I would have felt better if Boyle wasn't so good at painting the depth of the doomed. Read this book for structure, skillful writing, and contemp. Don't read it for inspiration."
1,A complete waste...,"I don't know what kind of people are reading and enjoying this book, but it was a waste of time. I hate leaving a book unfinished and this was by far the hardest book to push through. Just a cheap attempt at fictional hippy society. I felt as if the author was attempting to live out some fantasy through the book.To find this book enjoyable is to admit a lack of morals."
1,"Totally, like, boring and worthless","Maybe if you were there and have fond memories of the drugged-out, young life of a hippie commune, you will relate to this book. Otherwise, you probably won't want to bother. It's hard to care much about the characters who are mainly spaced out on dope, groping for instant gratification, and don't give a hoot about much of anything else. If this was ""fun"", I'm afraid I miss the point."
2,Drop City,"I just finished Drop City and I have to say it's completely forgettable. I cared for none of the characters and was quite disturbed by the author's fixation on gruesome, harsh animal death. Sure I understand that it is the wild wilderness and all, but hitting a horse, salacious details of a writhing porcupine, wolf's broken spinal cord, etc. etc. The ending tells us that Marco, Star, Cess, and Pamela live happily ever after? It ends with Cess riding his dogs, on his way to the Christmas celebration at Drop City North; who cares! what happens to Drop City in the long term? The author is surely thrown in personal vendettas, as the ""bad people"" wioll always lose to the ""good people."" The only truly well developed character is Norm, and he disaapears from the story without a trace."
3,Big Fizz,"I enjoyed the set-up of this novel, the characters, the commune, the pending move to Alaska, etc., but unlike other reviewers, I found this book to be a big fizz. The whole subplot of Sess v. Joe Bosky is contrived and unnecessary to the topic or novel, while the situation between the commune members doesn't seem to go anywhere or offer any new particular insights after they leave California. Like a previous reviewer, I too was hoping to lose some of the cynicism and find a meaningful ending, but alas I was disappointed when i finished the text, and won't recommend this book to friends. What would one say, beyond ""free-love, drugs, and communal drop-outs moving to Alaska""?"
4,I loved this!,"Great story, well written. The only drawback and why it did not receive 5 stars is because it was sometimes like reading two different books because the author kept switching back and forth between the hippies in California and the Alaskan folks living off the land. The story does converge eventually, but in the meantime, it was a little hard to keep finding a connection between the two groups until they meet up in the end."
5,warm your hootch,Death by superfrigid alcohol consumption...it was a first in a novel for me and an important cautionary tale. I enjoyed this book.
4,"Lots-o-hippies, very little plot!","Hmmmm...Have you ever wondered what would happen if a commune of hippies wore out their welcome in California and made an ill-advised decision to move to the backwoods of Alaska where nobody would bother them? Me neither. But if you read this book you'll find out.I found the characters and their interactions interesting and enjoyed the writing style. And not knowing much about hippies (before my time) I found the ebb and flow of communal life fascinating. As for plot, - well there were a few loose plotlines, none of which seemed to be more important than any other. And most of them went unresolved, possibly because the book ended in what any ordinary reader would think was the middle of the story, - almost as if the author lost interest half way through and decided to write a ten-page wrap up and move on to his next book.But even though the plotlines seemed fairly inconsequential, I zipped through this story quickly and enjoyed it.."
4,Interesting Social Study,"I was interested in this book immediately. The book was well written and initially the characters seemed to have depth and reality. As the plot developed, some became one dimensional, very good or very evil. A co founder of a commune in Sonoma County wrote to the SFChron ""Boyle took the most tragic occurences at various nearby communes... and created a Zap Comix version of alternative living that every body will just love to hate....Living close to nature is the best therapy one can receive, especially surrounded by loving and accepting brothers and sisters....Someday an author will write a truly inspiring novel about the communal movement..."""
5,Great read from TC Boyle,"I'm an Alaskan, born and raised... I grew up much like I imagine Sess and Pamela's kids would, and I have to say that TC Boyle is the only author from Outside who's ever written about Alaska and gotten it RIGHT. I thought this was a stupendously entertaining read... at 27, I'm way too young to have been a hippie, so I can't speak to the accuracy of Boyle's portrayal of the late 60s counterculture. However, I can say from a great deal of personal experience that his portrayal of Interior Alaska, its landscapes, its white people, its Indian people, and their lifestyles is absolutely spot-on. He even mentioned the Chena Pumphouse restaurant by name, which is one of my favorite places to drink beer and shoot pool.Don't listen to the bad reviews... If you want to read about the REAL Alaska, Drop City is right up there with Shadows on the Koyukuk, The Big Garage on Clear-Shot, and Alaska's Wolf Man."
3,I wanted to like it but....,"TC Boyle is a wonderful writer. His text leaps off the page and paints vibrant pictures for your mind. The problem is that this books pictures are simply boring - well realized and with pretty colors, but still of boring subjects.I wanted to like this book. I really did... But good writing has to be backed up by either an interesting plot or fascinating characters (or, better yet, both). This book has neither and I found myself forcing my eyes to continue reading. You can miss this one and not miss much."
3,A shallow deep puddle,"Having read Worlds End twice and loving it both times I was a little disappointed with Drop City. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent novel with deep characters (which Boyle is famous for) and a strong plot. But in the end I didn't feel like there were any true surprises. Every time I felt like there would be some amazing plot twist, nothing happened. A good intelligent read otherwise."
2,A big Disappointment,"The first 3 books in this series focused on Stone's quest to find his sister. He found her after a lot of action-filled adventures. He then went to work dismantling the plots of General George Patton III in books 4 and 5. Now in book 6 when he should be getting into new adventures, his sister is captured again!!! Didn't her military dad teach April Stone anything while they hid in their bomb shelter? This makes it look like the author is unable to come up with new ideas for the series so it's back to rescuing sis. What a disappontment."
3,So Gwen,"I bought the Hollaback girl doll because it's so Gwen like. The cool Gwen looks like Marilyn, and the Tick tock looks so french maid-Alice in Worderland like.The Hollaback Gwen is so genuine, I love the details on the buckle and the top."
4,"Just like any other doll, just with Gwen's face",I got this doll and the Bananas doll for my two girls. Nothing special about the dolls except they have the clothes from Gwen's video's and they look like her. I caught the dolls at a markdown so they were about the same price as a Bratz doll.
1,used book condition,I purchased a used copy of this book to replace one that I had borrowed from the library that got destroyed. I expected from the description that it was in fair shape so it would be accepted as a replacement by the library but when it arrived it was not in good enough shape for them to accept. It had some damage on the outside edge and the binding was broken causing some pages to fall out. We had to purchase another one elsewhere. The price was very low but we did expect from the sellers description that it would be in acceptable condition.
4,A Woman With A Mission,"This is the true and inspiring story of a woman who suffered alcoholism, the loss of a baby to SIDS, and the death of her husband but was not destroyed by her pain. She was ""healed"" by God and sent forth to bring hope and healing to others with the testimony of her life. The book documents her story and the miracles accomplished by her docile spirit surrendering to the Spirit and enabling that Spirit to work in and through her. A truly inspiring story."
1,Songs 4 Worship: Gospel - God in the House,"This CD did not meet my expectations. It was a waste of money. I was looking for something to use with my choir. It sounded great on the website, the pieces that I heard. I think if they are going to put various artists on a CD, at least let the music be worth listening to."
2,Item Not as described,"I ordered a book that was supposed to be in Very good condition. The book I recieved has markings, bent pages, broken binding, and a stamp inside the cover - hardly very good condition. Buyer beware! It was a gift I was embarassed to give."
5,Culkin at his best...,"Great family movies. Good price. Nice package. These are the kind of movies that one enjoyed when was a child and now you can share them with your own children, especially in this holydays near Christmas.I did not regret this purchase.Audio and subs: English, French and Latin Spanish, both movies."
3,blue ray quality bad,"blu ray quality was really bad, very grainy. I'm not sure if it was a blu ray disc. I would check the vendor"
2,Ok,The packing could have been better the box was banged up in the corner and left some small dings but the discs play ok.
1,"Be familiar with what ""Region 2"" means!","I ordered this for my family to watch in our countdown to Christmas. However, when it arrived, it would not play. My first clue came in scouring the case where I saw ""visit www.fox.co.uk"" Some online investigating confirmed that the DVD will not play here in the states. I discovered my error in checking my order history. It clearly states [Region 2] beside the listing; however, until now, I didn't know what that meant. Read carefully!!!"
3,Good Dvd Set,A good set of dvds with a lower and good prize.However it not has many extras like documentals or something else.Also it has Dolby Stereo Sound instead of 5.1.It should have 5.1 Dolby for a better sound experience but it's ok.The first one is better in my opinion with better gags but the second is also ok.A good set.
1,DVD,The dvd didnt play in my dvd player but will play on the computer. I dont know how to fix this. So the dvd is not much good for me.
4,Home Alone Collection [Blu-ray],"This will be fun for the grand kids to watch at Christmas. Should keep them entertained an laughing. Parents will enjoy, too."
5,Best Versions Yet!!! Blu-Ray Review,The title of the review says it all. These are the best versions of these films available. Sound and Picture quality un-equaled on any other versions. These movies have replaced Charlie Brown with the Grand Kids as the annual must see Christmas Movies so I have seen all the versions to date. I highly recommend this collection to anybody who wants the watching experience maximized.
2,Love these movies but not happy with the Blu Rays,"My wife and I love Home Alone 1 and 2. We recently purchased this and went to watch HA2 first because we hadn't seen that one yet this Christmas season and were extremely disappointed at the picture quality. The picture was jumpy in places and there was grain and squiggly lines all over the place. We ended up putting our original DVD in and felt that it was better.Home Alone on Disc 1 had some great extras but we weren't all that impressed with the picture quality of it either, though it was at least watchable compared to Disc 2/Home Alone 2. We ended up returning this because the original DVD's are just fine for us and in the end it was not worth the ""upgrade"" just to be able to watch the extras."
1,Home Alone 1 & 2,I bought these movies as a gift and found out that they dont work in my DVD player when trying to play them tried several different DVD players as well. Very unsatisfied.
1,HOME ALONE 1&2 ON DVD IN ONE,"TO BE HONEST, IT'S IN POOR CONDITION. IT WAS BRAND NEW AND WHEN I GOT IT I HEARD THE DISCS ROLLING AROUND IN THE DVD CASE. IT WAS A PRESENT FOR MY GRANDMA. I OPENED IT UP TO SEE IF IT WILL WORK ON MY DVD PLAYER AND BLUERAY PLAYER. IT DID NOT WORK!! SO I TRIED THE REST OF THE DVD PLAYERS IN MY HOUSE KEPT SAYING DISC READ ERROR I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS THAT IT SAID DISC READ ERROR. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO BE SOLD TO ANYONE. I WASTED MONEY ON THIS ITEM WHEN I COULD HAVE GOTTEN SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WORKED!!!!"
1,Does This Blu-ray Collection have Subtitles,"I bought the Home Alone Collection & was sure it had subtiltes listed, but once I recieved it I noticed there was no subtitle symbols on the package. Upon checking with the site, I didn't find it there, either. I need to know before I open it. Could someone please tell me, because Amazon won't allow me to ask them."
4,A Great Collection!,"The Blu-ray version of this Christmas classic looks and sounds fantastic. This collection includes BOTH Home Alone and Home Alone 2, at a great price. Best-priced collection out there!"
4,2 Christmas Favorites In One Package,"I finally have a nice clear version of Home Alone! Until now, every year I would fool with the settings on my blu-ray player and TV trying to get it to look right. The problem was the old DVD was in the wrong format, this looks excellent on a wide-screen TV - as it should. Home Alone 2 is not as sharp as the original film, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Still an unbeatable deal!"
3,Good for the kids,"The Home Alone movies,1 and 2,are still kind of fun to watch around the holidays.However the Blu-ray quality is inconsistent and not well done"
3,The 2nd set that I received worked,The first DVD I got was scratched and made my Blu ray player hum loud. The second set seems to be working but I wonder about the quality.
5,Great Deal,I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. I got it for $10. It was a great deal considering you get 2 great movies.
5,Mccauly rules,"You will not believe all the antics this child gets into when left home alone. More importantly, you will not believe how the magic of christmas works miracles on this family. Treat yourself and only watch home alone 1, because home alone 2 is a true disgrace to film making and home alone 3 is a crime against humanity."
5,A hoot!,This movie is one of the greatest comedies ever! I NEVER get tired of watching Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. A movie for the kid at heart.
5,"Classic movie, good quality!","Got this for $12.00, can't beat that price for two HD movies, especially such classics! Enjoyed watching them at Christmas, no issues!"
4,Good value despite disappointing HA2 transfer,"The other reviewers are correct - the picture quality of Home Alone 2 in this set is atrocious. It's so bad I wonder if the movie wasn't originally filmed on videotape. Blu Ray probably makes it look even worse. The sound is good, however. Aside from the poor quality of Home Alone 2, Home Alone is of excellent hi-def quality, both picture and sound, and along with its special features definitely makes this set worth the price. Recommended."
3,Home Alone Collection,"What can I say... these movies have become holiday classics! I would have given the collection 5 stars but in agreement with some other reviews, the video quality of the second movie leaves a bit to be desired. It's looks very grainy and would be hard to watch if you were forced to sit too close to the screen. To make things right, Fox needs to fix the video problems with the second movie and issue a replacement to customers who have already purchased this product. If that were to happen, I'd give this collection 5 stars!!!"
3,Home Alone,"Home Alone 2 is fine but Home Alone freezes about two-thirds of the way through. It picks back up but a small section is missing. This occurs in the scene titled ""Merry Christmas, Little Fella"""
4,A True Classic,Got this as a steal when it was on sale. My sister is trying to build her blu-ray collection and this made a perfect present. Too bad they didn't shoot the movie in Hi-Def because there is literally no difference between this and the dvd. Great movie at a great price!
5,Love These Movies,"Shipping was great and fast as usual. I loved the first two movies in this series, so just to get the first two was perfect. Would recommend for all those Home Alone fans."
5,Great movies for a great value,I'm so glad to now have these movies on Blu-ray. They are a great price; much better than I had seen in any stores.
5,Funny Classic,My all time favorite christmas movies! Grew up watching them as a kid and I still can't get enough! I love it!
2,Little Good to say,"The first one was superior to the second one in every way! In the second one the location is different, but the the plot is the same with little change. The acting was fair except for a few bright acting spots. The location photography in New York is good, not great. I found that the lead character was badly directed and because of this was allowed to overact and, except for some good places-not many- he did not come across with the same charm that he had in the first one. If you have the first one keep it and pass up the second one. If I had known how bad the second one was I would not have bought them as a combination!"
2,Could not watch it,"When I attempted to watch the DVD, I got the message that I had to take the DVD out because it was not for my region. This is partly my fault. I really do not know what the region information means. This is the first DVD that I purchased that I had to deal with purchasing it for the right region. When the seller sent me the DVD, I assumed that it would work in my DVD player. Even if I mistakenly ordered the DVD for the wrong region for where I live, I would have thought that the seller would have alerted me that it would not work in my region and offer to send me the correct DVD instead. I was hopeful that an exchange for the correct DVD would still be possible. I emailed MovieMars through Amazon on January 31, 2013 at 2:48 pm EST asking if there was any way that I could exchange it for a DVD that could be played in my region. To this date (February 16, 2013/8:56 am EST), I continue to wait for a response."
4,Just as exciting as the show,"It's great to get inside the heads of characters, that are seen on TV, and be privy to the way their minds work and see from where their attitudes stem. ""Emissary"" was a good book for that but -- boy! -- are those chapters long! Not wanting to put the book down until reaching the end of the chapter, you can easily finding yourself propping your eyelids open with matchsticks, if you're reading in bed. Like most film tie-ins, the book keeps faithful to the pilot episode but adds very little to the general story."
5,A DS9 novel,"It's fantastically comprehensive and full of action, sciencefiction, adventure and drama.Dillard provided a good intrepretationof the episode"
3,Too small for ball pumps,"This is the closest thing I have found anywhere recently for a threaded flexible pump hose for pumping bicycle tires. Although it will thread onto a valve stem it has a smaller than typical male thread for mating with a smaller pump,( I think it fits those old style long thin frame pumps) so it doesn't fit as is onto a ball pump. I made an adapter for it using an old inner tube valve stem but I had to file down the hoses threads so the adaptor isn't removable, its just good for ball pumps or insertion to compression hoses if I prefer to use a threaded connection."
4,NIce with only one flaw,"To answer the question above, no it does not recline completely. Other than that it is a great stroller. Well made, sturdy, lightweight, and cute to boot!"
3,Samantha's mom,"I got this stroller at my baby shower. I had origionally selected this stroller because it was just so cute. After owning it Ive noticed that they really forgot alot of features they should have included. First of all it doesn't have a foot rest, secondly it does not fully recline, the canopy is very short and doesn't protect from rain very much. Also, it doesn't have a snack tray like most strollers do.PROS: It is very light weight and easy to travel with because you can close and open it with one hand.It has more bad than good qualities. I wouldnt recomend it"
4,The call of thewild,This book was good it was very interesting at parts and also sad I would recommend it it was good
1,science for the dummy's dummy,"In addition to talking down to you and insufficiently covering a vast array of interesting topics, the humor of both authors (if you can call it that) routinely flops, except when they describe things that are intrinsically funny (like the story of the Raelians). The authors not only fail as science journalists (hard to believe they are science journalists, they write in cotton candy fashion) they routinely add in their own philosophies and beliefs tacitly, and argue them poorly (while failing to articulate other views). Overall a big disappointment packaged in a cool name and book jacket. dont judge a book by its cover!"
1,Waste of money!,I got this DVD because I wanted to learn to play leads. I am not new to the guitar I play rhythm guitar and been playing the bass for years. But this DVD is awful! The guy giving the lesson shows you a scale one time then he just starts playing all over the fretboard then he says just from these three notes you can play all this. Pretty much that is how the DVD is all the way thru. I bought two DVD's called 200 Blue Licks and 200 Metal licks and gotta say I learned a lot from those. Do not waste your time and money on this piece of crap. Buy the ones I suggested instead.
5,Excellent and efficient service,"After finding a book I have been looking for for a while, I was extremely surprised when 8 days after the purchase, it showed up in my mail box. It was in excellent condition and was a joy to read. Thanks again for the super quick service and quality."
4,Making Nano understandable,"Not being a scientist, and not having an understanding of Nanotechnology this book opened up a new world for me. Ted Sargent has shed light on a very complex subject so well that even I can understand it! And that is saying something. The book went beyond just the science for me and made me think about how we can utilise the thinking and the science. People tend to over analyse a book like this. Go with it and enjoy a new world. Loved it Ted!"
5,Scott IS Scrooge!,"Scott plays the quintessential Scrooge in this adaptation. Don't understand why it is not shown on TV..........Oh well, don't care I own it. Would not be Christmas without it. Oh sure, I still like the Alstair Sims' version also, but George C. Scott brings an added depth to Scrooge's character. Great Scott!"
2,Worked great for 2 months...,"This dehumidifier worked great for a little over two months. It ran mostly on continuous mode with great results. Then ice built up on back where the filter is, and it stopped dehumidifying. I'm in the process now of contacting Soleus about its warranty. I will update this post when this issue is resolved."
5,Quiet and Efficient,"I purchased this unit to replace an old noisy dehumidifier. I can't believe how quiet it is running! It has run continuously since i plugged it in, no more sweaty windows! I dump the tank twice a day, it does have a port for continuous flow tube, but that needs to be purchased separately, but I don't mind the dumping."
5,Quiet!,Soleus CFM-40 is QUIET and effective. My only reservation is the relatively small tank capacity which seems to fill up so quickly (because it's so effective!).
4,Quiet with good drain,Very quiet. Can't tell yet how well it is keeping basement low in humidity. Excellent drain since connecting a hose to drain direct to sink prevents any water from sitting in the container. Avoids fungus growth and need to clean water container.
5,Very plased with Soleus Dehumidifier,After a month long search of appliance stores and the internet I finally took a chance on the Soleus.I've had it for a month now and I believe that I made the right choice. I bought it because it had a lower Amp rating and was supposed to be much quieter than most of its competition. I hope I haven't jinksed my self by being so positive with my review. Time will tell.
1,"Run away, and run fast",These things are not good!Had one go bad - had it replaced - it happens - no big deal.Then I purchased another so now I have two.Both have leaked/overflowed on multiple occasions - totally inconsistent - will work fine for weeks and then one day - puddle (or worse). When it first happened I thought it was just a fluke or someone bumped it - not the case as it's happened multiple times with both machines.Look for something else - not worth it.
3,Soleus CFM-40 Dehumidifier,"We have used a number of dehumidifiers at our business which is in a double-wide trailer. Because of the nature of trailers, it can sometimes get very humid at different times of the year. This particular dehumidifier works very well yet the engineering design to empty the bucket once it is full of water, is quite poor. Due to the design of our facility, we are not able to use a drainage hose. The handle to pull the bucket out of it's resting position is located at the front bottom as you can see from the picture... which means that it is very awkward to remove it without spilling and carrying it to be emtpied is also difficult. The machine functions exactly as it should and is VERY quiet. This item will receive 3+ stars due to the nature of the bucket when it is full. Again, the machine works well and is very quite... so if you could use a drainage hose, you will most likely find that it should receive 4 or 5 stars depending on your own experience."
2,lasted for a little less than 18 months,"My wife purchased this back in Feb 2010. It worked great for a couple of months then it just died. We sent it back, it cost nearly $40 to ship back to the manufacturer. Customer service was great and we received a new unit within a week. This was in about April 2010. Now here we are in May 2011 and it has just died. We weren't even running it continuously, it was on at night. I've been looking at some reviews for these types of units and it seems that this is about their life span. That's pretty disappointing. Now I'm looking for a new unit, hopefully one that will last longer."
3,Like it but don'[t like it,"The Soleus dehumidifier appears to be well-made. It is light weight and is efficient at removing moisture from the air. Above all, it is quiet. EXCEPT that the fan on the Soleus cannot be turned off -- it runs all the time. This is inherent in the design (I checked with their customer service).Because of this energy wasting, white-noise creating feature, I will not recommend this appliance. I am keeping the one I have mainly because of inertia (it is inherent in my design). But if I had known about this feature, I would not have bought it."
1,3rd one of these...,"I purchased this unit because it was rated very quiet by others on Amazon. It also has the optional drain hole to attach a hose to it so you can forget about having to empty it all the time. Although it is quiet, the unit only lasts a year or so. I know because I have purchased several of them.. I haven't found any dehumidifer on the market that is this quiet and that's my main concern since I have it in my TV room. It would be nice to have a quality unit available from some vendor but it looks like that won't happen any time soon. It's all made over seas now..."
2,"Worked fine for almost a year and a half, then failed","Worked steadily without problems until it failed after about 18 months. Unrepairable, Soleus says, it's landfill -- nobody repairs these.Main disadvantage is any power flicker loses its settings and it stops until restarted."
1,They break!,"I've owned 3 of these units. I use them roughly 120 days a year. The first one lasted a 18 months; the second one lasted 10 months; the third one lasted 14 months. In each case, the condenser unit quit, and it stopped dehumidifying the air.The second one broke broke within the warranty period from when I purchased it, and Soleus promptly replaced it. I worked with a customer rep named Christopher, who was courteous and efficient.Despite this, I'll never buy another Soleus. The durability of them simply isn't worth it."
1,Junk-Terrible Warranty Policy!!,"I purchased this dehumidifier in April, 2011. It lasted about 10 months and then failed. Soleus sent a replacement under warranty and I paid the shipming. The replacement product lasted 6 months and then failed. When I contacted Soleus they said it didn't matter that the replacement lasted only 6 months. The warranty starts from the time of purchase. They refused warranty.Obviously they are building junk and are just trying to get their dehumidifiers to last a year and a day no matter how many they need to provide you. BEWARE!!!"
1,Soleus 40 pint dehumidifier,"I bought this in 2010 and it worked wonderfully the first year. It was even quieter than I had expected. In 2011 it would not dehumidify! I finally took it in to a repair shop and was told they ""all leak freon"" and that they would offer free recycling if I brought it in. It has been recycled. My buddy bought one on my 2010 recommendation and had the same final result."
3,"worked well for 4 summers, then quit","This little unit kept my large, old basement relatively dry for 4 months each summer, for 4 years. Then it conked out. The problem seems to be a switch, and from what I read a repair would be at least $140. Only 16 months of continuous operation, so I am a bit disappointed. But I did like the tube that I could feed directly into a floor drain."
1,JUNK,"Like sooo many other reviews written here, the Soleus Air CFM-40 gives the illusion that it is a top notch dehumidifier because of it's quiet operation. Purchased mine in May, 2010. Used sparingly during the humid summer months. Worked well for about 2 years but failed catastrophically without warning. Fan still blows and seems like the condenser is attempting to run as it gets quite hot and pulls 2.1 amps of current (rated for 2.9 amps) but no water condensing out. Seems to me after reading numerous other poor reviews that a seal somewhere in the coolant plumbing fails and all the freon leaks out all at once. One day it works well, next day....NOTHING. Naturally, one year warranty is useless. Should have paid more attention to the product when I bought....says right on the back label ..""Made in China""...... Save yourself the aggravation.....AVOID this company like the plague !!!!!"
5,Excellent product ?,Excellent product for the money. One day with it running eliminated ALL moisture on the inside of my windows. Have not had a problem with moisture since. Over 30 days running.
5,"As promised, REALLY QUIET","We researched for the quietest reliable dehumidifier after our conversation-drowning old non-Soleus dehumidifier died. The Soleus was just what we were looking for from the quietness angle. It runs in the living room and people don't even know it's on. A few other reviews have noted long term unreliability. At one month, it's too early to evaluate that but so far, so good. In our house, it gets emptied every morning and every evening yielding 7 - 10 gallons of high-quality plant water. Given the highly satisfying noise level, I hope that Soleus is concentrating on both reliability and service to gain and cement a lead that will be a benchmark. They could easily crush the competition."
2,Liked it while it lasted,"We purchased this dehumidifier in November of 2008, and it was dead in November of 2011. While it lasted it worked well, and very quietly. It seems to be built as a throw away, with no reasonable option for repair. My previous dehumidifier was a Whirlpool, and it lasted for about 12 years until its coils began to ice up, so in my opinion the Soleus is not built to last. My advice is to stay away, unless you feel that 3 years of service is acceptable."
5,Quiet and efficient !!,"We live in South Beach,Fl. Most of the year we run our central A/C, which keeps the humidity of our condo under control. But during the winter months, we were battleling with it. Specially in our walk-in closet, that is located next to the master bath:every time we showered with warm water, the vapors would sneak into it, leading to musky odors and mildew growth.So we got this de-humidifier and it has been a life-saver!! We run it during the day while we are at home, and it is so quiet we forget it's on.It pulls out a lot of moisture!!!Wish we would have gotten it sooner... Worth every penny!"
1,Soleus Dehumidifier CFM-40,"bought one in april, 2008...it quit in 2010...rather than try to have it repaired (Soleus phone person NOT helpful), ordered another (always an optimist) in may, 2010...it quit when i turned it on this spring (this is april, 2011)...yes, i kept the filter clean, etc....so disappointed...maybe just two lemons, but !!... WHILE it worked, it was fine, and the best part was that emptying the container was not too difficult...Soleus Air CFM-40 40-Pint Dehumidifier with Humidistat...i do NOT recommend it..."
4,Good humidifier for basement,"This humidifier is very quiet, but effective in our basement. You wonder if it is even working, because you can't hear it, but it is extracting the moisture, and doing its job. Easy to hook up with a standard hose to your basement drain of sub-pump as well."
1,Poor Quality,"Received unit April 5, 2010. It was very quite and efficient when it worked. It lost its refrigerant and started freezing up and quit dehumidifying in August 2010. Even though I had only used it for four plus months, Soleus refused to pay return shipping charges to replace it under warranty. I would not recommend this unit."
2,One-year dehumidifier,"I brought this dehumidifier two years ago. It worked well for the first summer - quiet and dehumidified the air. After storing it away for the winter, the machine did not work anymore when we needed it last summer. The fan worked fine but no water was collected (compressor problem). Fortunately, we were still within the warranty period and the company shipped us a refurbished machine. Took about 3 weeks. We had to pay for the shipping of the defective unit. That replacement worked well again for a year... Now I took out the machine and it is not working again. Same problem. It appears that if you store the machine away for a long period of time, the compressor part just stops ""talking to the rest of the unit""... I am not sure if I will buy anything from this company again... On a different note, my kenmore dehumidifier in the basement is still working after 5 years. Yet the Soleus machine received a much higher rating from Amazon customers than the Kenmore one..."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"After reading all the great reviews for this product (and I read every one of them), we plunged in an bought one last year even though we felt it was pricey. When we received it, we had a heck of a time getting it to power on. Once it did, it DID do a fantastic job at removing the humidity and it was very quiet....but it stopped working after a couple months. Something to do with the power on button itself, we think. So, my husband played around with it and finally got it working again. Wouldn't you know it? We had a power failure during a storm a day later. Now the dehumidifier refuses to work again.If I had to do it all over again, I'd never buy this brand."
1,"""I've flown with you twice and you've crashed half the time.""","I have purchased 2 of these dehumidifiers. After less than three months, one has stopped removing moisture from the air. The second dehumidifier, is currently working well. At this time, however, I do not know if the warranty is worth the paper it is written on.I live approximately 45 miles inland from the Gulf coast. It has been my experience that while the outside tempurature was still warm, one dehumidifier could lower humidity 10% or less in the room, form 60% down to 50%. Now that it has been cool this past week the still functioning dehumidifier has brought the humidity down from approximately 48% to 39%.During the higher humidity level days, the dehumidifiers filled their tanks two times a day. Therefore, I am glad that I purchased the larger capacity model CFM-40E. (Both the CFM-25E and the CFM-25E have the same size tank, supposedly the later removes more moisture from the air in a given time period.)"
1,Very Limited Range of Control,"We bought this dehumidifier for my 84 year old mother who has breathing problems and requires low (35%) humidity. We were shocked to learn, upon receiving the dehumidifier, that it had ONLY 3 settings, for 50%, 60%, and 70% humidity. The machine turns off the compressor when the humidity gets down to 50%.If you are looking for dehumidification down to only 50%, then I would rate it a 5 -- a nice (smaller) machine, but not enough range if you really need dehumidification.It arrived promptly from Amazon with Prime 1 day shipping"
4,Manufacturing defect,"Unit received timely and put in use. Upon first emptying of the water container, I noticed a hole that would have leaked water before reaching the full point. It was obviously a molding process imperfection and small enough to temporarily seal so that the unit could be used. The Company was contacted and quickly sent a replacement. The unit performs as stated and the humidity level is controlled well, (50%) at its lowest level."
1,Did Not Work At All,"We purchased this Soleus dehumidifier only to find out that it had a faulty part and did not work at all. We only realized this after multiple calls to Soleus, by which time we had recycled the box. A call to Amazon was not particularly helpful and which would have charged us a significant ""restocking fee."" We had to ship it back to Soleus, at a cost of over $50 to get it repackaged. Still waiting on the replacement and hoping it works."
3,It doesn't stop running when it's full!,"Hi, this dehumidifier was great at the beginning. But now if it gets full, it'll just keep running instead of turning itself off. And it gets a big puddle of water on the basement floor which defeats the very purpose for me getting it.Am I doing something wrong?UPDATE: I didn't close the water drawer all the way so it messed it up and didn't shut off.Like others wrote, it worked for about a year and then just stopped working. The fan now just works but it doesn't collect any water.I won't buy another one of these."
2,What customer service???,I purchased on of these and the humidistat died after a month. The thing would only run on continues. I emailed them 3 times from their support page and called them 4 times just to get voice mail. No return calls or email.... I will NEVER buy their junk again.
1,Will not buy again,"I bought one of these, CFM40, and used it less than 2years and it stopped working. I first noticed there was a problem when there was water all around it on the floor. I removed the back cover thinking the drain hole was plugged up but then noticed the coils had frozen over and also encased a small sensor/controls circuit board mounted behind the filter. Of course the circuit board was shorted out and rusted up. Called the company for a replacement board and was willing to pay for it but their reply was ""we do not carry any internal parts"". So I am dead in the water after less than 2 years of use. Of course warranty was only for 1 year. Product is great and runs well but will not last long. Will never but Soleus again."
4,Dehumidifier Works!,"I have been using this product for a month and it does remove a good amount of moisture from the air. It's compact, relatively quite and for the most part I am satisfied with the purchase. The only problem I have is it seems to run all the time until the tank is full (usually 24 hrs) no matter what setting you have it on. I wonder at that rate how long it will last."
1,Stopped working in less than four months of use!,Compressor stopped working in less than 4 months of use! Cost me $40 to ship it back for a replacement. Save your money and buy a different (reliable) brand.
3,good but certainly not great,"This is a pretty good little DH. It is small which enables you to carry with ease to different rooms and is very quiet as opposed to my older Kenmore that I had for five years. It seems to do the job but at a slower rate that my Kenmore had. I have noticed that the filter collects alot of things quicker than the Kenmore and I have to clean it more often. Maybe that is good or bad? I do like that the Kenmore sucked the wetness out of towels and the floor within an hour. Soleus takes a bit longer and I do not like that it does not have a 3 hour on/off energy star shutoff like the Kenmore had. If you don't hit power, the fan will always run. I am also worried that if it breaks I will have to spend $ to send it back on the other coast."
3,Worked great... for a while,This unit was very quiet. You can sit in the same room a read or watch TV with no distraction. The fan runs continuously so you don't know when it's really taking water out of the air. This is only a problem if you'd like to turn it off during the winter to save energy. The Kill-a-watt said it was using 330w when running. Pretty darn good.Now the bad. After about 2 years it stopped removing water from the air. The cooling system had apparently stopped working. Most dehumidifiers on the market have a 5 year warranty on the compressor/cooling system. The Soleus only has 1 year on everything. I guess they figured out how long it'll usually last without problems.I was really sold on this unit until it quit. Doubt that I'll buy another one from this company unless they improve their warranty.
1,Lasted four months,"After about four months the overflow sensor failed. After that it would overflow and flood the floor, then eventually stop.I think it stops when water flows into the basin and causes it to short circuit.After that the humidistat failed.Assuming a six month lifespan, this is an exceedingly expensive device.I would not buy anything from Soleus."
1,Stopped working after two years,"We used this product successfully for two Northern California (damp) winters. This winter, after we took it out of storage (in its original box, as recommended by the manufacturer), it has basically stopped working. The fan operates but it no longer pulls any water out of the air. I've noticed that the coils in the back seem to be freezing up. Customer service was no help. From my Internet research, this seems to be a common problem for these units, a problem with the compressor that is too expensive to fix. I would have given this a high rating in the first two years, but a product this expensive should not fail so quickly. Don't buy this unless you want to buy something that will prematurely become a worthless piece of junk."
1,"Worked 1 season, No Service support.","The CFM-40E worked ok for one season. In a 600 Sq Ft Basement, it nevergot the humidity below 60%. One year later, no longer works at all. The 1.888 number NEVER picks up. The soleusair.com web site makes it clear they will ONLY deal with units under warranty - there's no help for regular service.To the Dump it goes."
1,Buyer Beware!,"We purchased the Soleus CFM-40 for use in our basement just over a year ago. The unit is no longer working and the warranty just expired, but we have the option of sending back to company for repair at $45/hour, plus the cost of shipping in both directions. A dehumidifier should last much more than a year. We would not recommend this product."
1,quite but dead,"Bought two of these units two years ago. Worked well until the warranty expired. Then the first compressor quit, and six months later, the second unit quit. Don't buy these units based on the raves on quietness. My two units and those bought by others simply did not last."
2,Bad Customer Service,"The unit is great, but if something goes wrong, forget it. I bought mine from Amazon. It arrived with a defect. I contacted Soleus via their website and got no reply. I left a msg on their voice mail (they are West Coast so don't open until late Central time). Never heard from them. Finally called in the middle of the day only to be told that I would have to pay to have it shipped back to them. Still waiting to hear from a supervisor and now looking for the President's name and address to write a letter of disgust. Is this really any way to run a company?"
1,Avoid this product and company,The dehumidifier ceased to work properly after a month. The compressor would not turn on and it would not remove any water from the air.Attempts to contact customer support have gone unanswered.These items have a very high failure rate.AVOID purchasing any Soleus products.
1,"Horrible ""Service""","This machine comes with a 1-year warranty. If anything goes wrong with it you must ship it back to the factory at your expense, over $45. These are very troublesome machines. I have two of them. Once the year is up, you are on your own. Soleus does not sell repair parts for this unit, nor do they make them available to anyone else, including appliance parts or repair shops.No one should buy any of these units, period. That is, unless they are willing to write off their cost after one year.The product is nice and quiet, though.The company has no service and is extremely arrogant about it."
4,Works Great and pretty quiet,"I have owned mine one year. It's usually on. It's effective: keeps the entire 3-room basement dry. A guest slept in the basement and commented on its quietude the next morning.Its fan always runs when ON, even thought the compressor may not be running if the humidity is low.Be careful to keep the closable vent at the top open...it can be closed while the machine is on, which is Not Good (but not fatal for mine.)Mine did freeze up once; it was left on at ~60degF.Remember to clean the air inlet cover mesh once in a while.Keep in mind that 40 pints means it can remove that much H2O in a day; you'll have to empty the pan all too often; I use a hose-to-drain now. The hose drain is ~12"" from the unit's bottom, so your drain must be lower than that. Little pumps are available(elsewhere)so you can drain UP to your laundry tub. Worth it!"
1,"Runs all the time, until it dies.","Runs constantly, then it started freezing up and stopped working. Got a couple years out of it. Poor reliability."
1,Soleus 40 Pint Dehumidifier - some flaws,"The Soleus is quiet, and does well in removing moisture. My 3 criticisms: 1) I had an initial problem switching settings (it was locked in ""high"" mode but that cleared after unplugging)-- not a major issue, but a poor start; 2) the tank is too small -- it fills up very quickly, so I'm sorry I picked this model; and 3) it never shuts off unless I turn it off or it's full. I think it's defective.In short, a mixed review: it does a good job, but it has significant faults.Update a year later: it broke (the sensor mechanism connected to the bucket failed, so I can only get it work with a crude override of sensor, and can no longer use the bucket. I need to have a tube rigged up and an external bucket). It still never shuts off based on the moisture levels, and if it weren't such a waste of money, I'd throw the stupid thing out. Real piece of garbage. I would not buy this product again."
1,Glad It Is Gone!,"I purchased this Soleus Air dehumidifer December 2008 based on reviews and Consumer Report. It stopped working March 2010. I wasn't happy with this product from the start. It overflowed several times so I figured maybe it needed leveled. I set it on a piece of plywood and made sure it was level. Sometimes that worked and sometimes it didn't. When I would try to empty the tank, it would overflow on my carpet so I had to cover the plywood with a rug to catch the spills. And emptying the tank was tricky. There isn't a handle to help carry the tank and it was usually filled to the brim. I was both annoyed and happy when it quite working. I now have a 50 pint Perfect Aire dehumidifer setting in the same spot I had the Soleus, without plywood, and it has been working great! Had this dehumidifer lasted longer, maybe I could be more forgiving but, hence, that was not to be!"
2,Machine stops working after 1 year and a half,"I purchased this in Sep. 2005 after reading the reviews. When it worked, it was fine, pull water and quiet. But it suddenly stopped working. The customer service said the price fixing it is similar as buying a new one because they have only 1 year warranty and no extended warranty even you are willing to buy it.So I wouldn't recommend it to any one unless you expect to buy a new one after only a year and a half!"
2,Worked great but died after 3 years,"I bought this unit in late 2006. It's quiet when running and keep a room in my finished basement dry. I've been using it about 8-9 months each year during 3 seasons 24*7, with a hose attached to drain the water. I just wish it could last longer. I have another dehumidifier from another brand. That one is still running..."
4,Works well - wish the tank were larger,The dehumidifier works well and is LOW in noise output. I wish the tank were larger.
1,Not made to last,"It worked well for a week or so, although the dumping apparatus and its housing seemed flimsy. One day it just stopped working. It powered on correctly, seemed to be working, but collected no water in very humid conditions. I tried again after giving 24 hours of rest with the power off but with no success. I was very disappointed and certainly would not recommend it."
5,great product,"We were looking for a dehumidifier that wasn't as bulky, noisy and hard to move aroundas the one we had before.This one is worth the time we took investigating: it removes moisture very efficiently, theunit is pretty quiet, and good looking. Easy to move from room to room. After trying thisunit for two weeks, we bought a second one. It's just what we wanted in a dehumidifier.Not only works good and quietly, it looks good too. You can still listen to music with iton!"
5,So quiet and effective!,"We took 13 gallons of moisture out of our 750 sq ft apt over the first few days. Works so well, and can't notice that its on as it is so quiet! Don't wait until the mildew tries to take over your closets..."
3,Soleus Air CFM-40 E 40-Pint Dehumidifier with Humidistat,"This humidifier works well. My 2 complaints about it are that the size is too small (my fault) and the water bucket is hard to remove without spilling water when it is full. You have to grasp the bucket from the bottom and pull out. It fits snugly, so any jerking motion puts water on the floor. It would have been nice if they had added a handle to the collection bucket. Otherwise, I like this dehumidifier."
5,Great Dehumidifier,"I just bought this a week ago to replace the Magic Chef unit that was so noisy I couldn't stand to run it. After plugging it in, I was skeptical as to it's performance, but WOW! It works great and is so quiet I can run it 24/7 and it really pulls the water out of the air!I am considering another one for out in my den. This is a definate must have if you have humidity issues."
3,Very quiet but low capacity,"I got this dehumidifier because of the reviews for quiet operation. It is very quiet, and although I appreciate that, part of the reason is because of the lower capacity operation. If you are looking for a machine to suck the air dry in a basement or other large space you will be happier with another model. Also the ""automatic"" shut-off when the bucket is full was broken and made a mess on my floor several times before I bought a pump for continuous operation.I will continue to look for a dehumidifier that balances noise and function better for use in a finished basement."
1,Not lasting Long,I purchased this dehumidifier in Oct. 2008 for my basement. It worked fine for about a year and quit working last winter. It was quite and pulled large amount of moisture out of air when it worked. The fan still runs and blows air out of vent but it can not withdraw any water from air. I expect the unit last longer than one year considering its cost (>$200). Very disappointed.
2,Good Start -- Poor Finish,"After approximately two years, the CFM-40E unit I bought from Amazon, runs fan only now with nary a drop of moisture pulled from our basement. The manual's troubleshooting help tells you to clean the filter or check for blockages in the intake duct or discharge duct. Cleaning the filter is routine maintenance and we have been faithful about that. Checking and clearing obstruction from either of these ducts is not intuitive and is definitely not covered in the skimpy owner's manual.As other owners have noted in previous reviews, it works great out of the box for 1-2 years and then quietly fades away. I too was expecting more longevity from a dehumidifier than 2 summers."
2,stop working after 18 months,"Got this unit on 10/2008. It stopped pulling out water, but the fan still works. I expected the product to work for at least 4-5 years."
2,Worked great until it quit after 3 years,Bought this unit because it was quiet. And it was VERY quiet and seemed fairly efficient. Only downside seemed to be lack of restart after power failure.It worked well for almost 3 years but now has completely died. Fan runs but no moisture is pulled out of the air.Disappointing.
4,Good for the price.,This dehumidifier works well. I bought one for my daughter and me. The only problem is that it has a small water capture unit. I have to empty the water twice a day.
1,Worked the first summer that I bought it and not the next...,"Initially, I thought this was a good product. It was quiet and seemed to work well. I used it during the summer in my basement the first year, put it away for the winter and then tried using it the next summer. It did not work. After countless times of trying to get in touch with customer service, I was finally told to clean the air filter, which I did, and it still did not work. Customer service told me that the dehumidifier was no longer under warranty and they would not fix it. Overall, one of the worst products that I ever bought and the worst customer service to match! I will never buy another Soleus Air product again, nor will I recommend this company's products to anyone. Bottom line: Save your money and wasted aggravation. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,Worse Humidifier I've Ever Owned,"I bought this dehumidifer in October, 2007, received it in November, 2007 and in July, 2008, I have no dehumidifier!! This is the 3rd & 4th dehumidifier I've owned and it is by far, the worse unit I've ever purchased. The 1st unit that I bought leaked water all over my basement floor after I'd had it for only 2 months. I contacted Soleus, they sent me a new unit, only after I had to mail the broken unit to them at a cost to me of $35! The new unit arrived and worked for about 6 months before it stopped working. The ""full bucket"" light will not go out, therefore the unit won't work because it thinks the bucket is full. I refuse to spend another penny on this unit to return it to Soleus in California. I based my purchase on the good reviews that this unit received. I can't believe my luck......I had to get 2 defective units. I honestly believe that the 2nd unit that Soleus sent me was a refurbished model and not new, as they told me. Be wary of these models."
1,It stinks!,"I purchased Soleus Air cfm-40 and in 15 months the compressor went out. Yes, I know it only has a 12 month warrantee but Gee whiz. I called the company explained the problem. They quoted $49.00 hr service fee plus new compressor and shipping both ways $70. I ask about regional service. they said no and they hung up on me.So it is a throw away!!! It stinks."
2,Really poor design on tank overflow switch,"The metal ""spring"" which engages the on/off overflow switch broke off. I can't see anyway to replace it. Asked Tech Support for help. Soleus said tough luck.This is a design fault that they should address, as the lever can, and does, easily get caught on the drain pan when removing it. $250.00 down the drain.Naturally, this happened just after the warranty ran out.Soleus Air CFM-40 E 40-Pint Dehumidifier with Humidistat"
1,went dead after two years,I bought the 40-pint Soleus dehumidifier in February 2008. It worked fine for two years. Then it abruptly died. Had a technician look at it. He told me the compressor just won't charge. It's not worth fixing since a new compressor plus labor would cost too much to be practical. Called Soleus customer service. They in effect told me: tough luck. In my opinion this is a piece of junk.
1,Two units each broke after only a few months use.,"The first unit worked for 4 months and we turned it off in the Fall. When we turned it back on in the Spring, the compressor failed to work. Customer service was not very responsive and it was like pulling teeth to get a replacement unit. We finally received a replacement unit but had to pay for shipment. The second unit stopped working after about 2 months. Once again, we turned the power off and the compressor did not work when we turned the unit back on. I would not recommend this unit."
1,Only works for 9 months,Buy at your our riskThe Warranty is only good for a year.My first unit worked for about 9months and then quit working. Manufacturer sent a second unit it lasted about 5 months and quit working. Now I'm out of warranty and have a boat anchor but not sure if it would even be good for that. They don't repair these units just replace them if they are out of warrantyother reviews are right it is a quite unit
4,Solusair 40 pint Dehumidifier,"The Solusair 40 pint dehumidifier is working well and as advertised. It is quiet and effectice for my apartment It is quiet even in the max mode of operation. Amazon was exceptional in that the first one ordered did not function as it was supposed to. Amazon immediately had it replaced with a new replacement, at no cost to myself, and the new one worked efficiently from the start."
5,"Quiet, mobile, works","This is a nice unit. Quieter, lighter, and easier to use than other dehumidifiers I've had. Pulls water out of the air quickly and works flawlessly so far (1 month). Don't expect to be able to use it like a table though and maybe it wouldn't stand up to much banging around as its mostly plastic."
2,Poorly designed!,"Unit lacks a provision for a drain tube, so you have to empty the reservoir manually at least once a day. Also, if the power gets interrupted, the unit forgets its settings & shuts down. Not worth the money!"
2,Has Issues,"I purchased this dehumidifier about 3 months ago to use in my under-the-house garage. It is very quiet. I can't hear it unless I'm right next to it. And it sucks moisture out of the air although its humidity setting can't be set as low as my previous dehumidifier and doesn't get the garage as dry. The biggest issue with this device is the ""float"" to detect when the reservoir is full. It does NOT work reliably. When the reservoir becomes full, the water overflows onto the floor (about 2/3 of the time). And it is very difficult to remove a full or nearly full reservoir without sloshing some of the contents onto the floor. SO, unless you enjoy checking and emptying the reservoir frequently (in my case, twice a day) OR you hook it up to a drain hose and don't use the reservoir (hard to do in below house level garage), this is not the unit for you. I would not purchase this unit again."
3,Wished they lasted longer!,"I've owned four of these units.They are great when they work...Exceptionally quiet, so much so that I can have multiple units running in the same room as a TV without excessive noise.The problem is that they just don't last. Each one that I've owned has only lasted 2 years. With another one just dying, I don't know if I'll purchase a fifth.Most dehumidifiers have durability concerns, but for the price I want better than 2 years of service. I previously owned a poorly-rated Kenmore that lasted well over 6 years; purchased a Soleus for something more quiet and because of many good reviews. Why can't they last longer?"
2,3 months/yr * 3 years = lasted 9 months total,"This unit worked fine until it died suddenly (?). 1 year warranty, so it's done. I used it for 3 months out of the year for 3 years = 9 months total usage. I will shop around for the next unit."
2,soleus dehumidifer,"I bought this unit in April 2008 and was delighted with it, until this week. It basically stopped collecting water. We checked the manual, nothing was amiss. Upon calling the company, we were told that the compressor was probably the problem, so it is time to buy a new unit. It seems to us that a unit should last more than 1 1/2 years (we do not turn it on from November until May)."
3,its ok,"This device seems to make the basement hotter, its working great as a air filter though, and on those rainy humid days when it is set to moist it feels great, but once you put it on dry it is like having a indoor heater, the bucket fills in one day when it is set up to dry as well.I am not to happy with this product overall"
2,Good for 3 years only...,"I have a three year old Soleus Air CFM40-E that stopped extracting moisture from the air in year three. I followed the recommended maintenance as many other owners have. The unit just stopped dehumidifying. The fan and controls continued to work, but no water output. It was quiet and effective when it worked. My review is very typical to many other reviews on the unit. So, since I paid about $180.00 for the unit, that figures out to about $60.00 per year for dehumidifying.I think that Soleus Air should get to the root of the re-occuring problem so the unit has a longer life span and a more satisfied customer base. There must be some ""weak link"" in the unit that fails between 24-36 months. I'm a retired engineer and know that there must be a quality control issue that need addressed."
1,soleus dehumidifiers do not work,Bought this dehumidifer in Dec. of 2009. stopped working 9 months later. Soleus has no customer service and no one to contact. This dehumidifier freezes up every time I turn it on. Two hundred dollars worth of junk. Need to get the better business bureau involved in this sham. Also this dehumidifier is made it china. Wish I would have known that when Ibought it.
4,Works great so far!,"I haven't had this unit for very long, so I can't comment on the durability issue some people have had. So far, this unit is working exactly as it should. The ""quiet"" mode is still a bit loud for use in a bedroom, but overall this unit is a bargin for the price."
1,"Quiet, but does NOT work so great","The compressor will only run in ""continuous mode."" Preset humidity levels only cause the fan to blow. The dehumidifier will, at its peak, get the humidity level in my ~200 sqf, 70 F, finished basement down to 53 percent. I was hoping for better. Other than that, it IS relatively quiet as far as dehumidifiers go.*** UPDATE ***Completely stopped dehumidifying after 1.5 years of seasonal use only. ZERO STARS!"
4,good dehumidiers,I've used the soleus for about 2 months now and it has worked flawlessly. Fairly quiet and east to use.
4,"Good Support, quick return of defective item.","I gave this a 4 because the component works great when/while it works. After it failed, I called Solenus and returned the item (save your box/packing). Within 2 weeks Fedex delivered a new component, no hassle what so ever other than having to return the old one (no charge for return). I see also where others report failures within a year or shortly afterwards. So,I would reconsider this if I had to purchase another dehumidifier. But Solenus was very nice and easy to work with on the failed item."
1,unreliable,This unit did not last 6 months. The warrant is terrible. it cost almost as much to ship back and the price of the unit. Very poor quality and service.
1,Mine died too!,"We liked this dehumidifier for as long as it worked. It was super quiet, attractive, and seemed to do a good job of drying out our basement. I have the same story as some of the other reviewers. After storing for the winter, it did not work again. I checked online and tried all the things I can do at home to see if I can get it going, no luck. The fan runs fine, but the compressor never kicks in. At this point, I will not buy another Soleus product, there are other dehumidifier manufacturers making quiet units out there. These things are too expensive to just buy a new one every year, but not expensive enough to pay to have them serviced/repaired - bummer."
1,Do yourself a favor Buy something else,Bought this unit last summer. The unit worked well. I stored the unit for winter. When I turned it on this spring no moisture condensing in the bucket. The unit is worthless. It would cost more to get it fixed than it would to buy another one. The manufacturer should be ashamed.
1,It died a month after the 1 year warranty expired,"Real convenient how the item breaks a month after the 1 year warranty expires huh? I spent $188 dollars for a lousy friggin year. It sickens me how these companies make trash that is meant to break and there is nothing that can be done about it unless you want to fork over $50+ dollars for an extra warranty when you buy it.Well, my advise is, don't buy this, or if you do, be sure to spend your hard earned money on an extra warranty since the company clearly doesn't make a product that lasts."
