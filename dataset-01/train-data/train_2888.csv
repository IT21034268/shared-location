2,"works good, cheap components","This heater worked as advertised with occasional use for 3 years, then it broke. Had to make a tool to remove the rear screws. Drive a 10D nail into a piece of wood (for the handle) then remove the head and grind the nail tip into a triangle. Turns out that the cheap Chinese-made pull-string switch had failed. I replaced it with a simple 15A on/off toggle switch that I mounted by drilling a hole in the rear plastic housing. It works fine, for now."
1,Limited life. No way to fix,Found the tool to remove the cover. CAN'T FIND THE ELEMENT! Need help finding part.Do not buy this. There is no service. Their website is worthless.
1,REPAIR IMPOSSIBLE,HEATER WORKED GOOD BUT QUIT/FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REPAIR OR GET HELP FROM COMPANY NEEDS SPECIAL TOOLS AND SAYS NO CUSTUMER REPAIRS POSSIBLE
1,Don't order this from Amazon,I heard the preview of the CD and I thought it was beautiful. But Amazon sent me the wrong version again and again that was out in 1982 instead of this 1994. The older one only has 9 songs and is much cheaper while this is suppose to have 31 songs! I requested an exchange but they just sent me the same wrong one. I am so disappointed. Amazon used to be better. It's totally ruining my Christmas!
5,Philosophy of Nature,This is a fabulous approach to understanding how modern science plays a role in a greater appreciation of one's belief and in the fulfillment of Revelation.
1,Not worth $4.29 ea,Went to local Dollar General store and for $1 you get a much better sprayer and bottle.I might consider it a deal if they were 5 for $1 and even then the quality isn't there.
2,DISAPOINTING FILM!,I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS FILM BECAUSE IT LACKED DEPTH OF THE CHARACTERS INVOLVED. IT WAS CHEESY WITH NO REAL STORY.
2,Lower City,"Horrible movie- the characters go through sh** and back and the ending has no comfort. A lot of nudity, sex, and fighting. But not worth watching unless you like this director's type of movie, where the ending makes you use your imagination to find out what happens to the characters."
2,Good for a hard surface.,I have worn the knee pads for about a month. The straps don't give much support but they seem to stay put better than most. The caps dig into most surfaces and leave scars on asphalt shingles. They do provide fairly good kneeling protection on concrete and wood subfloors. I know this will be my first and last pair of this product.
5,Recommended,"This is a collection of valuable insights on how to determine real economic value, as opposed to accounting value, accounting gimmicks or financial nonsense.All that and some humor too. Grat book!"
3,Efficient Delivery,Reasonably priced second hand CD that delivered quickly. Given the CD was second hand I appreciate it's condition wont be perfect; the CD was clearly in second hand condition but acceptable.
2,Not as good as I hoped,Was expecting a fun afternoon read however this book lost my attention the hero was a blubbering fool and lacked anything to keep my attention. Very little romance.
5,Simply the best,Great story! It is funny and pleasure to read.Absolutely loved the scene of the father-son talk about brides.Would love to read more of the author.
2,Too long,"Two and a half stars, really. I liked the novel at first and found myself laughing out loud at a few of the situations, but somewhere about page 200 it all started to wear on me; it just went on too long. I started to skim, which I seldom do, and actually thought of putting it aside entirely except that I had already invested so much time with it. I also second what another reviewer mentioned, that so many of the passages were a little too reminiscent of ""Pride & Prejudice"" - I've watched the BBC version so many times that I can practically recite it verbatim, so those same passages in this book just jumped out at me to the point I think the author went a little too far with it. The bottom line: I doubt I would read another by this author."
2,Juice Quantity WAY Off,"The process of soaking the seeds, dusting the mats with azomite, soaking the mats, sprouting the seeds, and watering the wheatgrass was fine, and a fun project. My problem is with all of the false advertising. They don't tell you the mats are not reusable until you buy everything and read the instruction booklet. Waste. Then they say the amount of juice you get is about 12-15oz per tray. I got 4oz per tray!! Total rip off - after the price of all the parts plus the hand juicer, and the small amount of juice you actually do get, totally not worth the cost. It would be cheaper to get a wheatgrass shot from your local juice bar."
5,Title,"'Cadman Requiem'must be one of the most beautifull pieces of music written in this century. If modern classical music ever made a must-have CD, this could be the one. 'Adnans songbook'is great to, though it loses in beauty compared to Cadman Requiem. Poor the 'musiclover' who misses out on this album..."
2,Specifically a Kindle Review,"The book is excellent. I'm only on page 33 and have found the book to be very informative and interesting. The problem is that i am on pp 33 and have encountered so many errors (wrong spelling, missing apostrophes, 'z' instead of '2' and the list goes on) on the kindle version that it has forced me to write my first ever review. very disappointing."
4,Good for people that follow the dots.,"I bought this book about two months ago and I found that it really helped me to get started. It fell short in the encouragement department. It just didn't teach me how to listen to other players. I actually had to put it together with a DVD that has some of the same songs on it to give me an idea of how to move up and down the ""Fretboard"" (that has no frets) before I felt I was doing more than playing the dots.Don't get me wrong it is worh the money and is a great place to start. Just get beyond the starting point."
3,TomKat,"This book was confusing to me. I read the book in its entirety and had no clue what it was about. If you are a beginner, you may want to go with a more simpler book."
4,Good for the price,i really liked this as it is sturdy compared to another one I had bought previously. I dunno about very heavy boots but it holds the normal winter boots well. Also for the price its worth it.
5,love it!,super happy with the shoe racks!! put them together in less than five minutes and they look great; I ordered two for my child's closet and I am ordering two more for mine since my shoes are always falling off the bars on the shoe rack I have.
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality, broken easily by my 20 months old baby. Also, once it falls apart, the long steel stick is dangerous...save money and get some better quality products!"
4,"Easy, Secure, Great Price - Edit: 1 year later still standing","I am very happy with my unit/shoe rack. It goes together with NO TOOLS at all(yee ha) It is not designed for left/right stresses, but is just fine against my wall.It holds 6-8 pairs of Men's shoes, but I assembled the shelves upside-down. This allows the floor to be the bottom ""shelf"" and so it's good for an additional 3-4 pairs!Edit: As of 4/15/2012 I'm still using it, and still happy with it."
3,Ok value.,"They work, and they look ok, but they're more flimsy than i expected. The horizontal bars are hollow and the welds holding them to the vertical sections aren't great. They flex a bit under the weight of regular shoes/boots, and you're asking for trouble if you put any substantial weight on them with your hands,books, or with a 20-month year old baby as one reviewer described. I bought three of these off off amazon and then one more elsewhere under the whitmor name, hoping that it would be better quality, it wasn't. In fact they're both made by whitmor and i couldn't see a difference even though they had different model numbers. All in all, they're ok, just know what to expect."
2,Nice looking.. but,Very cheaply made.. bottom of leg broke as I was screwing in the hex bolts...treat it very gently or just don't go cheap like I did
2,weak product,"the item was relatively easy to assemble, but the quality is not very good. the drawer does not track very well and there were pen marks visible on the shelf."
2,Doesn't match the other Mission pieces,"I bought the mission file cart to go with a mission side table, bookshelf, and coffee table. It does not match the other three in look or in build quality. It's even a different color. It was harder to assemble than the other pieces, especially the file drawer. For a printer table, I would recommend the sturdier side table instead."
4,Great File cabinet,"couple improvements I could think of this file cabinet.1. side of the file cabinet drawer is ply wood. not rubber wood material like the rest of the cabinet. you can see the surface from the side. it would look much better if it had rubber wood finish to it. Assembling drawer. aligning bottom and front panel and side panel perfectly in place then trying to put screws in, wasn't exactly easy task. lastly, I wish they provided some sort of shock damping rubber sticker, so that drawer doesn't slam everytime it closes.It still is a great file cabinet!"
1,WARning: Very poor product,"WARNING: Do not believe what you read in the positive reviews.I bought the desk, as well as the side desk and file cart. I depended on the very positive reviews. These are truly terrible, terrible products, and all three pieces of furniture had fatal flaws. Now I have to return them and find something else. The fabrication, cut, fit, and fasteners display shabby workmanship and cheap materials. I'm a decent carpenter but I cannot fix fasteners that break under moderate pressure, badly warped tops, and badly ill-fitting pieces. How bad? The rails for the drawers are so far apart that the drawers just drop through. The fasteners are very cheap pot metal and three of eight failed in one piece of furniture.I notice that the reviews tend to be old, while I'm buying in 2009. Perhaps once upon a time this was a good product, but no longer. You will be very disappointed."
5,"Can't beat the price, good and sturdy","Hey, for a ""put it together yourself, comes in a box deal"" this cabinet is far better than the cost! Easy to put together, sturdy and the bottom drawer can be used to store things not just for files (we use it for music equipment and CD's) the middle shelf we use for storing old vinyl and the top is for our turntable. It's pretty large, bigger than it appears and worked out PERFECTLY for it's intended purpose."
4,"Great value, some tricky assembly","I'll echo some of the other reviews and point out that the final assembly of the drawer can be a real test of your patience. The panels don't quite line up until ALL the screws are fully tightened, and even then you might have to apply some five fingered persuasion, or as my Dad would say, &amp;quot;Give it a whack to let it know who's boss&amp;quot;. If you're having trouble inserting the wooden plugs that cover the screws you'll want to use a rubber mallet to drive them in. If you don't happen to have one handy you can avoid marring the finish by using a small hammer with an old sock slipped over the head to tap the plugs home.Outside of those two minor assembly glitches this is an excellent unit that is sturdy, attractive, and very functional. Since it's made from real wood, albeit end glued boards milled to shape, you'll find it considerably stronger and lighter than comparable items made from MDF that you'll find at this price point."
1,Awful!,"I bought this product along with a number of other cherry juices and concentrates. It was by far the most expensive--$34.19 in the health food store (cheaper on Amazon, but still way more than other concentrates). Of about 5 different cherry juices and concentrates I've tried so far, it was the only one I didn't like--and the only one I actually hated. It looked and tasted so bad (brown, bitter, weird) I feared it was spoiled and poured it down the drain. Worse, I contacted the company by e-mail to tell them about it and request a refund, and have not received even the courtesy of an acknowledgement after more than a week. I will stay away from this product and the Pure Planet brand."
4,Hakka Dialect,"The Hakka Dialect; A Linguistic Study of its Phonology, Syntax and Lexicon.Mantaro J. Hashimoto does an excellent job in his overview of Hakka, one of the languages of Chinese. Its full title sums its contents admirably.The dialect of Meixian (Meihsien, Moi-yan) in northeastern Guangdong Province, China, as given by his informant, is used for discussion of its grammar, and vocabulary. Europe"
5,Great blanket!,"Great blanket to take to the park or anywhere. Since it has a waterproof backing, it also doubles as a diaper changing blanket in a jiffy."
4,"Read it, believe it! Be free from fear and anxiety.","I jumped for joy after reading this book! Finally, all my doubts and my fears were conquered. It is true. I've known it since I was a little girl. But who could I tell? Who would have believed me? And now I see, there are others who know what I know.It all makes sense. At last, one can look back over time and see that our journeys here have not been in vain. There has been a Promise, a Purpose and a Destiny: the Alpha and the Omega."
5,awesome!,"This book is packed with so much information that I constantly had to set it down to absorb what it said, then I would quickly pick it up again. I really enjoyed the screenplay format because it was more visual. It was just like watching a movie. I can see why the title of the story is ""Revelations"" because the information is captivating. If you are looking for the answers to life, read this book. Almost every page is packed with information. It is a real page-turner!"
1,Wolf in sheeps Clothes,This book it's deceptive and very cultish.Read your bible study it meditate on it daily. This book is not of God.
3,Good dirty fun,You get what you expect from this type of dvd. Nude girls and wild parties. Wasn't the best video I've seen. It did have some hot moments where things got nasty.
1,I cant understand everybodies hype about this dvd,"The strippers are cheap and old, at least above 30. The girls arent really attractive, so I dont understand why everybodies feeling so excited about this dvd. The action is sort of fun to watch but it gets old quickly and there isnt anything special happening on this dvd. All there is to see are some cheap strippers getting naked and entertaining a bunch of horny guys, well great.For me it was a waste of money and Im going to try to get some of if back by selling this dvd on ebay. You really have to be cheap if you think that this content is cool."
4,Beyond Girls Gone Wild,"If you like the soft Girls Gone Wild videos this isn't for you. This goes way beyond anything that happens on those. This DVD has the oh so hot porn star Cali Cox, plus SUPER HOT fitness model Dina Marie Vannoni. This video is made up of 4 bachelor parties and features 8 girls including Cali Cox and Dina Marie. What I enjoyed best is each party had 2 hot babes stripping nude to show it all from head to toe.Then they would kiss, rub, and go for it with each other. One cool thing was the whip cream show you have to see to believe. It'a ll good in this video. The bonus striptease video was a nice touch. I recognized Jacy Andrews from Playboy TV doing a strip dressed like a red devil. The other stripper is a well breasted blonde. That's what I liked about the video.What I didn't like was the audio from time to time on the bachelor party parts of the video. It would spike sometimes when the guys would yell. Overall for under $20 bucks this is a steal."
1,NOT At All Worth The Money,"I would heartily reccomend not buying this dvd....It is obviously NOT a real collection of real bachelor parties caught on tape...Instead of that this is obviously professional dancers/models and guy actors who stage these parties...The lighting is obviously not amateur and actually very good AND all the girls stared at the cameras while they were dancing...Most of the good shots, or the shots that were most daring were blurred out...This dvd is not worth the money...If you want professional dancers and staged scenes and want more explicit scenes instead of getting teased, then buy dvd's at your local music store..,."
4,Two thumbs up,"I really enjoyed this reality video. I'm sure part of that comes from me having to have the dreaded combo bachelor/bachelorette party. After watching this I can see why an all guy party with beautiful strippers is an american tradition. There was a nice variety of parties and strippers. I'm sure there is something on this for everyone's taste. The full nudity was awesome. Not to mention it went on for a very long time. Chicks kissing is always a huge plus too. This went a lot further than my GGW videos. I didn't get bored because instead of just flashing the strippers on this video did shows that included whip cream, tequila, beer, and other crazy stuff. This also had a nice bonus 10 minute movie on it of stripteases done by blondes dressed as a red devil and school teacher. Fun to watch."
5,Bachelor Party Madness,"America's Wildest Bachelor Parties is the ulitmate reality video. It delivered exactly what it promised, footage of wild parties, beautiful strippers, and some of the craziest behavior I've seen. I've been to a couple of bachelor parties, but nothting like these. Cheaper than a lap dance at your loccal strip club and better. Buy it."
4,very naughty,"America's Wildest Bachelor Parties delivers the goods for sure. In this video the crew drops down the damn hottest footage I've ever seen taken of bachelor parties.You got hot stripper honeys dropping their drawers and gettting ... naked. The video crashes four parties that have the heat boy. Every party is a girl on girl show that will make you yell .... You got blonde babes, Latin chicks, Redheads, and they all get naughty.You got dudes going crazy eating off whip cream bikinis of dames. Taking body shots off the thong boy. This video is for grown folks that know how to lay it down at a party. Grab yourself one of these boy."
1,oink ! oink!,This dvd is truly an oinker made for low-brow men. I was shocked at what women had to do in this dvd to please their all male audiences at bachelor parties or I like to call pig-fests. This sophmoric romp shows porn stars and strippers taking off their clothes for money. While not on the level of prono the raunch and nastiness is still there. My gosh these women only had their clothes on for a few minutes before stripping. One clip from a party I found particularly distasteful shows a groom to be taking shots of tequila off the rear of a stripper.
5,Cute,Use it or collect it. It came earlier than expected and in perfect condition. Very safely packaged as well. It was described as a lunch box but is perfect for a little girls purse as well. Very nice.
2,Great Movie; TERRIBLE DVD Transfer,"4-1/2 Stars for the Movie; Negative stars for this DVD!Witches Mountain is one of those great 70's Horror movies with that strange atmospheric Italian horror film vibe. The story unfolds like a bad dream (you'll need to watch), and if you like Italian horror you will love this movie. Very reminicent of the Dario Argento, and Mario Bava films. HOWEVER, this DVD quality, picture & sound is much more horrific than anything. The picture quality of this DVD is soo bad this REEL CLASSIC FILMS issue of a great lost classic should be illegal; I returned this DVD version to Amazon. A much more watchable transfer of this movie is found in the 50 Movie Pack Chilling Classics by Mill Creek Entertainment; 12 DVD set of 50 classic Horror movies. Avoid this single version."
2,Even Witches Can Be Boring...,"A photographer (with the world's biggest hair) and a girl he just met, take off for a jaunt through the mountains. Odd things start happening, yet add little or no tension. This is one sllooow movie! The beginning, which has a little girl killing an extremely fake cat and getting burned up by her mum, is mysterious in that it has nothing to do with the rest of the story! The ""shock"" ending, where the hairy photographer gets a big surprise, was so long in coming, that once it arrived I stared bleery-eyed, hardly caring anymore! If you like witches, black magic, etc., you might enjoy this. However, it's quite a trudge to the final pay-off..."
1,Pretty worthless even for the Witch buff,"As somebody else this movie has no payoff whatsover, There is no violence, whatever violence is done is shown offscreen!!! No gore, no nudity, no suspense, no blood curtailing screams. Nothing.The director seems to have no clue of how to take advantage of a really easily plot involving like adding deaths, adding sex, adding gore, building up an explosive climax. It's really mind boggling consider that when the ""witches"" are revealed many of them are quite attractive.The witches themselves RARELY appear in this movie only midway then at the end. The movie basically has a couple stranded on witches mountain. They spend a LONG time hearing voices and eerie music, but there's never anything horrible that's revealed.In the end, we get a revelation but it's so obvious it's not scary. There are better horror movies to watch about witches such as ""The Witching"" or ""Witchery"" This one ain't even close to being recommended."
5,Great Album,This is a great album if you like old style hymns. Very uplifting music. Old favorites with a new twist. Avalon's albums never let me down.
3,Not as great as I had expected,"I don't wanna deceive Avalon fans but this rendition to the hymns isn't that great, or should I say ""out of common"".. Even tough it arrived home broken, I had a listen to it, and it didn't grab me as other Avalon projects did in the past. Am not gonna say that it's awful tough but they sure could've done it much better. Maybe I'm wrong, some may like this album, depends if you only like slow-balladry stuff. I prefer projects with very different genres. I expected stuff like the Oxygen's catchy tunes. Once again, I think no one did better rendition to the old hymns than 4 HIM. I tell you: it's a must have. Sorry Avalon, but this time, I could only give 3 stars."
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"Avalon has come from a mighty long way and hearing the new hymns cd Faith proves that Avalon is still on it's game. The cd is full of fresh and modern new taste. This is a must have cd. If you don't have it yet, I recommand you get it."
3,Gift,"This was a gift for someone , He enjoys it alot, Said that he often sings with it!And its one good track after another!!"
3,TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS ? ! ? !,"Discovered this book on my Mom's bookshelf. She'd received it as a gift. After making one of the recipes, I decided to purchase a copy for my kitchen. Aaaaack! $228 ? ! Are you kidding ? ! I honestly thought it was a typo and then discovered that's the real price they're asking. I don't care if they say it's 6 books in one. The book isn't any bigger or better than any other cookbook its size. This is no rare edition and my budget doesn't allow for $200 cookbooks. And I own alot of cookbooks. Let me know when the price drops to a reasonable amount. I'm still in shock at the nerve to ask over $200 for this book."
1,How to review an item - which so far never shipped?,Ordered the item 1/9/07 with an anticipated delivery of 3 weeks.Received twotimes requests to accept further delivery delays or cancel. Hopefully it willship now beginning of April.
2,A bit disappointed,"I'd practiced some jo work in my Aikido class before, and I bought this hoping to learn a bit about classical jodo to supplement that. However, pretty much the first thing this book says after a brief introduction to the history of the jo is that despite the subtitle ""The Art of the Japanese Short Staff"", it doesn't actually cover jodo at all, but the jo techniques found in Aikido, which actually derive from the yari (spear). It covers the basic strikes in moderate detail, and lays out the sequence of the 31-step jo kata: there's very little here I didn't already know, and I'm hardly an expert on the jo.It's not poorly organized. If you have no familiarity with aiki jo technique, it may not be a bad introduction. I just wish the description had been honest about what it was actually about, because it was basically useless to me."
1,Useless,Musashi said something like: amateurish martial arts are a source of serious injuries. He also said that many schools of martial arts are more decoration than reality. My opinion is that this book covers very little of the serious stuff you need to know in true martial arts.
4,"Great travel, but dialog boxes throughout text annoying",I really liked the idea of the book. The dialog boxes scattered throughout the book were distracting. The text was also in the book so it was not helpful.I must say that I liked the idea that each family member was responsible for writing a diary and sharing that with Richard. Good info on Asia.I also enjoyed reading about the young girl and her experiences on the road.
5,Lotte Lenya is the greatest!,"The one and only Lotte Lenya was married to Kurt Weill, and to this day she remains the outstanding interpreter of his work. There are many songs here in which Lenya captures the gritty texture of Weill's songs (some of the lyrics are by Brecht, others by Kaiser). One of the (many) highlights of this CD is the Ballad of Mack the Knife. Louis Armstrong and Bobby Darin did good, jazzy, bouncy recordings, but for me Lenya's is the best -- it strikes just the right balance of liveliness and grim humor. If you want to hear what Kurt Weill sounded like before he went Hollywood, I can think of no better recording.NOTE: I bought this CD to replace my treasured LP. The CD adds the Seven Deadly Sins, but it lacks the German and English lyrics that the LP had. There may be a website from which it's possible to download the bilingual text. But even without the text, just enjoy the music -- there's nothing like it, and there's nothing like Lotte Lenya."
3,Lotte Lenya may be overrated,"I ordered this CD because I wanted to order the 'three penny opera' and the more items you order, the lower the percentage of the shipping costs are. There are only three songs from the 'three penny opera' and luckily they are in German as I hoped (because I already got an English version of the opera), but most of the other songs are in an opera singing style that are between telling a story and real singing. It may work on the stage, but not on a CD. And Lotte clearly isn't a brilliant singer.But, the CD has a booklet with a lot of information about the history of the threepenny opera etc. Which makes it worth much more than the 4$ that I paid for it."
5,Lenya the Legend,"I had never heard, or heard of Lotte Lenya until the opening line of ""Seven Deadly Sins"" on this priceless reissue combined with the ""Berlin Theatre Songs."" I was dumbstruck, stunned, and realised I was hearing a singer who actually becomes the character. Song after song--tragedy, irony, gayety, cruelty--delivered with a voice that shudders, groans, or slides as if from experience. And living in 1920's Berlin, much of it likely WAS experience.Teresa Stratas and Ute Lemper give interesting, sometimes evocative renditions of this music. And Gisela May is a melodramatic mimic of Lenya--devoid of character. Hearing Gisela after Lenya is almost offensive.BUT, Lenya! To the person who hears Lenya here for the first time: brace yourself! She is a phenomenon."
5,A Sexy Little Book!!!,"This is a little 6"" X 6"" case-bound book that I bought for myself and now plan on giving as gifts to all my friends. Every gay household should have one on display. What with all the erotic colored drawings that reminded me of Tom of Finland's work, this is a sexy little book. Each letter of the alphabet from A-Z holds the key to hot and funny scenes of gay sex. Maurice Vellekoop is a wonderful artist and has written very funny lines here. I really enjoyed this book. My advise is to get your copy now before you forget & or it goes out of print."
5,it is as informative as they get,this has all the needed info for and details needed to get a proyect going and to confirm your ideas againts it. it was a very good reference book for checking up on those shady areas of construction with wood frames.
5,Straightforward,This is a very easy to follow guide to wood frame construction. I recommend it as a basic reference.
2,Good source but may need to be updated,Overall this book is a good source for general framing and is well illustrated to explain the concepts. It includes a good basis for details such as braced walls as well which has become more of a code issue in recent years.
2,Not very informative,"Unless you are a professional contractor, and if you are, you don't need this book anyway. I built a garage earlier this year and purchased this book as a reference. This is a very detailed book, but be careful and check your local codes. I would consult a contractor first in your local area, most will talk to you at no charge, if they want to charge you, keep looking"
3,"It's Ok, There are Better Books","It is all about graphics in this book, a method of presenting that I enjoy but it needs some text and why behind those graphs. There are much better references out there on the subject than this book."
2,Lacking,"This book has many gaps in graphics and content. Ultimate Guide to House Framing, 3rd ed. John D. Wagner, is much better at both."
3,where's the cd-rom,"I loved' this book for it's structural details and variety and for the many hours of toil it has saved me from when the designer and the architect can't seem to get the details on paper. It is worth the price of admission as a reference book and I',ve been waiting for the cd-Rom to show up with transportable features!"
3,"Good, but lacking some important information","This is a good reference for framing details, which I turn to frequently as we work on the design for our new home. That said, there are numerous gaps and while some might be excused as esoteric, like framing a swept roof at the eaves (though it is pictured on the cover of the book), many others are not, such as flashing at masonry entry steps. I would like to see the book updated to include more ""Building Science"" lessons, OVE (Optimum Value Engineering)and perhaps SIPS. Still a good book, overall."
5,Excellent guide for the amateur builder,"Over the years, I've referred back to this book many times.I recommend it for anyone thinking about building a deck or an addition.It has the answers that you are looking for."
4,pretty good,This book has a lot of good framing scenarios interesting tidbits. Both a good reference and interesting to page through.
5,best self help book i'v seen,This book is excelent. 100's of details and clear descriptions make this book perfect for learning this subject. This book would be apropriate for both beginners and profesionals. The paperbacks spiral binding makes reading and photocopying easy.
5,Good solid drinking glasses,"These are good solid plain drinking glasses, just what I wanted. They are just right for adult hands. They are stable with reasonably thick glass. They were just like I expected and am very pleased with them. We've had them a week and not broken one yet, my last glasses were smaller on the bottom, with thin glass and would tip over in the sink and break."
2,Not 20 oz,"The glasses are fine, but they are not 20 ounces as advertised. When measured, if we fill it to the very top of the glass, it's almost 18 ounces. Not a huge deal for home use, but we were going to use them in are cafe, and unfortunately now we can't."
5,No obvious osmosis.,This product is a drinking glass. The liquid stays on the inside and does not flow onto the table. There is an opening on top so you can pour the liquid into your mouth. Make sure the opening is on the top side when you use this.
5,Quality product for cheep.,I received the glasses as expected with prompt delivery. When I opened the package one of the glasses was chipped and I called the company and they refunded my money for the one chipped glass. The other glasses were top quality. They are large but not too heavy. Very easy to drink from.
3,doesn't get used everyday...,"it's lovely to look at when it's new, and compared to non-stick and/or cheapies, it's a lot safer & cooks so much better and evenly. the lid is nice and fits snugly. you will, however, have to scrub this baby all the time. the underneath discolored a bit [right away] from use too. (i'm sure barkeeper's friend would take care of that.)as far as the size of the pan, i thought it was a really practical size if only cooking for 2 people; for 3-4 it's definitely too small.UPDATE: after purchasing this, i acquired a few le creuset pieces. i prefered the le creuset so much to this, that i sold this pan on ebay. if you like this pan, but don't like the upkeep, i would recommend trying the le creuset buffet casseroles. they do make a small one, similar to this size and they make 2 larger sized ones as well. because they are enameled cast iron they clean up really easily."
3,hard to clean,"The shape is nice but the pan is hard to clean. The box says dishwasher safe, but the instructions say not to, so that you don't ruin the finish. But the finish was marred after one use and one hand washing."
5,very versitile!,"I love, love, love, love, LOVE this pan! It heats evenly and quickly, and clean-up is a breeze. I only have two people to cook for on a regular basis (me and the boyfriend), so it's perfect for everyday. I can make chicken picatta for 4 in this too when friends come over (any more than 4 servings I usually bust out the one huge pan I have - also a Calphalon)The handles are the best part - I hate maneuvering long handles when trying to wash dishes or fit everything into my tiny cupboards so this pan is a dream come true."
4,"Nice size, bit hard to clean","This is a nice, medium-sized pan for everyday use. With a little butter or oil, even eggs don't stick if you cook at low to moderate heat. It heats well and evenly. Does steaks as well as pancakes, vegetables. Cleaning can be a bit difficult, though. A stainless steel cleaner like the ones recommended in the pan's literature work, but it's hard to clean the rim's indentation at the top and around the bolts attaching the handles. I would purchase it again or others like it."
3,Size Debate,"The bottom of this pan nicely covers the 8 inch burner on my ceramic stove top. It measures 1 7/8 inches from the inside bottom to the brim. It holds a maximum of 8 cups of water. It was adequate to cook a package of ""Thai Kitchen Pad Thai for Two""--but not to stir vigorously. This is a pretty little pan that cleans up nicely. Just don't expect to cook for a family with this."
3,too high maintenance for a lazy cook,"I usually buy non-stick pots and pans for easy clean up/convenience but wanted to try other alternatives due to safety concerns. Stainless steel seemed to be the best alternative. I'm not a good cook and usually try to stick to recipes that allow me to cook the pants off of meat (i.e. stews). When I tried cooking meat on this pan it tended to stick and I had to transfer the meat to a non-stick pan.Maybe I wasn't using it right. I had to scrub the pan with ""Barkeeper's Friend"" to take the brown spots off. I'm weary of using the pan again because I don't want to have to spend 5 to 10 minutes scrubbing a pan after each use.I actually found another brand that's better suited for me. Cuisinart Chef's Classic is also stainless steel. It's lighter than the Calphalon and, unlike the Calphalon, the inside has a smooth finish so meat didn't stick on the pan."
1,Calphalon Everyday 10 in. Pan,"I was so looking forward to this pan. The first (and so far only) time I used it, everything stuck to the bottom. Very disappointing & hard to remove. I'll try again soon but will probably try and ""cure"" it first. BTW all my other cookware is Calphalon, so obviously I love it."
1,Not easy to clean,"This product has a very contemporary look that is all that is good about it. And that's the reason for one star.The lid is very heavy compared to the pan itself, the handles don't really stay cool. And the food sticks, even on low heat settings.The clean up is not easy if anything. I have to scrub the pan myself after it is out of the dishwasher.I am not at all happy with this product, I expected value for my money spent with calphalon."
1,Faith and Fortune,"This is a totally unauthorized version of exploiting your own family. Each child involved feels used. Each child involved requested that it not be printed and Dad went right ahead... not only that, even if the story is interesting, it is terribly written and tweaked in its approach ...Mom thinks this is unforgivable.."
1,Quality control is questionable....,"This is a very basic and functional CD player, if it works.... The shock protection, once you turn it on, is not bad for most activities. However, the quality control in the manufacturing process is highly suspect. I bought two of them as presents for my nieces. One of the players didn't work - when I insert a CD and hit the play button, it displayed ""no disc."" I returned it for a brand new replacement, which also had the same problem. So I return it again and I finally got one that works. The customer service at Amazon is really good, but the manufacturer of this player needs to improve quality control so we don't have so many defective ""new"" players."
4,funny and beautifully illustrated reproduction,"A fun story, with delightful illustrations. In an Alice-like dream, Poppy falls into the Vege-Men's land, where she is planted and sprouts. This edition is a facsimile reproduction of the book that was originally written in 1897. Rather long for today's children but will appeal to readers of turn-of-the-century children's books or collectors of Bertha Upton's Golliwogg series."
1,disapointed,"very disapointed by this computer, the hard drive is so slow, it's a drag.I miss my old Dell.If course, they never mention when you buy the Sony laptop that the disk is a slow RPM.Stay away.stephan."
1,Sony Vaio PCGGRT260G - junk,"My husband spent close to $3000.00 for the vaio notebook - it was my Christmas present 12/03. Now the video card does not function at all. The notebook is 15 months old and useless. I will never buy another Sony product. The part is $274.33 - I will use my reliable desktop, we have three Compaq computers that have funtioned fine for years. I have had it with sony. When it did work I would ask for help with some of the programs, they always directed me to on line help. I give up the notebook is sitting on the desk, I keep it dusted - can you imagine how disappointed I am with the entire Sony corporation. Fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on them.Mrs. Donna RobertsonDonnaleecr@aol.com"
1,the worst of the worst,"when I first ordered this computer I thought that it was going to fit all of my needs. One of which is being able to carry it from place to place, which is not posible because it weighs in at justunder eleven pounds, and when you factor in the bag which you have to carry it in because you definitly dont want to break such an expensive computer it weighs about seventeen pounds. For your own satisfaction get another computer."
3,Better for Female Readers,I liked this book for the most part. The author does make gender wars observations that preventme from recommending it to young male readers. Anything positive and specific to their make upis immediately qualified. I wish we could get away from this.
2,forget the teeball stand,"You are better off just buying a bat & ball. The teeball stand in this is worthless. It depends on a plastic screw connecting threading into the plastic tube, and on mine the screw was too small & they wouldn't thread, therefore the stand will not work. Plus it's thin & flimsy & I wouldn't expect it to stand up for too long anyways. If you really want a stand, buy one seperate & forget this one!"
2,Lost a part,"Ours didn't fall apart but we did lose the plastic screw that holds the stand together. Since I can't find a replacement, the only option is to buy a whole new set, which I probably won't do, not in the same brand at least. Also, this same set is only $9.99 at many stores, including Target."
1,JUNK\ UPDATED!!,"This is garbage my son used it for all of five minutes and after the second time he hit the tee the nut holding it all together literally shattered rendering it useless and now a waste of perfectly good landfill space. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: called customer service and the were very apologetic and promptly sent a new set which has since been destroyed, but lasted about a month with vigorous 3yr old play levels, the tee flies farther than the ball, I seriously think I got a lemon the first time"
3,Item okay,Not as sturdy as I thought it would be but my daughter likes it. I will probably buy something a bit more sturdy so she doesn't have to keep picking up the tee
1,mom mom anna,ITS A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!! TOO LIGHT......THE BASE NEEDS TO BE HEAVIER. IT TIPS OVER SOON AS CHILD HITS IT. MY GRANDAUGHTER PLAYS T BALL AND KNOWS HOW TO PLAY BUT CAN'T PLAY WITH THIS. WE HAD TO PUT A BAG OF HEAVY STONES TO HOLD DOWN THE BASE. I JUST GAVE IT TO HER......TOO LATE TO SEND BACK ........PASSED THE GUARANTEE TIME. SORRY I BOUGHT IT. MY GRANDAUGHTER JUST GETS FRUSTRATED. THE DESCRIPTION SAYS HEAVY BASE SOOOO NOT TRUE.
1,A Horrible Book,"This is a terrible book. The prose is nothing short of atrocious, and the suggestions really don't make a lot of sense. If you don't believe me, read the sample pages. Anyone that could get through an entire book of that garbage just enjoys torture. Get a different dissertation book; there are other quality ones out there."
1,Not so twistie,Me and my sister saved our money for this because we saw on tv that you can do braids really guick but after we bought it and used it we saw that you can NOT do a reall braid like it shows on tv all it can do is twist your hair. I recomiend to not by this its a waist of moneyHannah
1,it [stinks],"i got it when it just came out and paid [the money]. it s stupid worthless thing. never used it because it doesn't work. trust me there are better things to do with your money. and plus it doesn't take that long to braid you hair. at least you braid it not twist it. plus the ""twist"" falls apart in about a minute."
1,what a piece of junk !,"This thing is a real piece of junk, it does'nt braid hair at all, it just twists it. And it does'nt even twist correctly! I tried and tried again and I never got a satisfying result. If you're looking for something to braid hair, don't bother buying this thing. Just continue using your own hands. It may be slower but it's less frustrating..."
1,deceiving product image,based on the product image i was expecting a five pack of cd's. thought it was a great deal so i bought three. i was shocked to receive three individual cd's. i'll never buy from you again.
5,The One and Only Standard,"During his lifetime Antonio Stradivari made approximately 1,100 instruments, primarily violins. Herbert Goodkind photographed 700 of those, the rest presumed lost to history. Each instrument is photographed front, back, and profile. Some also have detail photos of the scroll and f-holes. Interestingly included are a few guitars which the master made.The photograph section is preceded by a short history of Stradivari and his instuments in history. These essays reveal the historical discourse on violins and give perspective to the modern violin historian. It is amazing to me that such a work was ever undertaken to begin with and stunning that it was actually completed. It is a 780 page tome with a copyright of 1972 complete with long abandoned paper quality, even for its time a rarity, and beautifully embossed cover sheets front and back. An amazing piece of work and the world standard."
5,excellent!! a must have,great movie... sidney is excellent! its one of those movies that u can watch over and over again.
5,YOU CAN'T UPGRADE ON PERFECTION!,"I can't believe this all time great classic is being remade with the likes of P.Diddy! He can't act well enough to be Sidney Poitier's stand in, stand in. Just leave it alone."
5,A STRONG BLACK FAMILY,Sidney Poitier&Crew Give a Classic Performance here.Despite all the hardships being faced Sidney&His Family are Together as one.that's the magic of this Film.Very Essential&Touching.Very Powerful.
5,Great Performances,"I teach AP Literature and Composition to high school students, and this version of A Raisin in the Sun is close enough to the play version to be able to let them view it before the test. A few areas are different, but it's close enough. Sidney Poitier has always been a favorite of mine, so I'm a biased observer. They only thing my students commented on was that the apartment the Youngers lived in seemed nicer to them than they had expected after reading the play."
1,I ordered the wrong copy,Although the attitude of male superiority is strong in the Glover version as well the addition of technocolor created a more satisfying experience. Can I return this version for the version with Danny Glover?
1,DVD was messed up!,"I bought this DVD to play for my students who are reading the book. I tried to watch the movie first before showing it to them. At first, all was well at first. By the time you got to the dramatic scene at the end, the DVD stopped working. I tried to make it work several times by going to scene select but did not have any luck. Clearly, something was wrong with the DVD."
4,Great movie!!!!,"The movie was well written and quitetouching, without being sappy. If you seen Soul Food and liked that you will definetely like this movie. The acting was superb!!!!!!!"
3,A VERY unusual collection of different genres,"This British CD dates back at least to 1986. The CD bears 22 tracks, each from a different type of music. Each track presents a work performed on a different type of musical instrument; some quite eclectic. The liner notes call it ""A kaleidoscope of rare and beautiful music."" Instruments represented on the CD range from a vocal piece on a phonograph cylinder and one from a 78 rpm record, to music from a pianola roll (player piano) and a wonderful piece from a barrel organ. Everything from a piece performed on a Stradivarius violin to one on a treble shawm. The CD is charming, amusing and interesting as it offers a glimpse of musical development and history through your ears."
5,"""Blues Image""","I was snooping through Amazon and ran across the picture for this album and just had to write.This band rates in my ""top-ten all-time favorite bands"" list, not for this album, which I've never been privleged to hear, but for their first album, which I've never been able to get enough of since I bought it back in 1977. I can't imagine this album being anything less than their first one was, and it was fantastic! Of course I know ""Ride Captain Ride"" as well as its B-side ""Pay My Dues."" I LOVE ""Pay My Dues,"" and if you're a guitarist, it's ALOT of fun to play!!!But, ""Take Me to the Sunrise,"" ""Leaving My Troubles Behind,"" ""Do You Have Something to Say,"" and ""Reality Does Not Inspire"" are a heck of alot of fun to play too, and are dang great songs (as is that entire first album). We need their first album!!!!!"
3,A little to much drama but interesting,"The program starts out really good. Good subject matter experts, lots of explination of scientific facts of anatomy and motion. But then it gets a little to dramatic/preachy toward the end. About 70% really good material. I think if you want to get the message out to the modern competitors, you need to use more facts and less emotion. It is a little expensive, but you will learn something from it. I don't regret purchasing it."
2,list maker - not good,It's great when it works. Sometimes it can't find the most common items in it's bank of items. You can add items to the bank but it is very frustrating because the cursor moves all over the alphabet making it hard to choose the correct letters. When you are able to add an item sometimes it still doesn't recognize the item you just added. I should return it before I take a hammer to it!
4,Almost Perfect...,"A great concept, and very good product. The speech recognition could be a slightly better, but if you have some electronics savvy (ie can operate a computer), you should have no problem. Two key features: (1)The ability to teach the SmartShopper new items and (2)The ability to improve and learn voice recognition for individual items really make this a great product, once you learn them.Recommendation:* Great for 20-30 somethings* Good for technically savvy 40-60 somethings* Would not buy for my grandmom"
2,dosen't work,I ordered this for my 83 yr. old Mom thinking it would help her with grocery list. It has a hard time recognizing her request for items. I tried it and got the same results. The products are in the register but it does not recognize the voice. It does not do what we expected it too and it is very frustrating. I will be returning it.
3,Fairly good!,"Very cool concept, looks neat and stylish on the fridge. Does a ""fairly good"" job with the voice recognition for all of our family (even the 4 year old). The problem is the vocabulary is very limited (will recognize milk, but not skim milk, whole milk, etc. Can recognize cookies, but no chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, etc. Als, there is no method to add new words or type in words it doesn't recognize, but you can hand write the additions on the tape if needed. Has fallen off of the fridge a couple of times and still works fine!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"My husband loves gadgets and thought this would be a nice Christmas gift for me. NOT. It has serious problems with voice recognition; for example, we cannot get it to list ""bananas"" which is in the library. It's much easier for me to write my list on a piece of paper. A real big waste of money!"
4,Always misplacing your food shopping list....this is for you,"SmartShopper Grocery List Organizer, Model SS101 You'll never lose your list again or have several lists. You press a button, say your item and it's stored in memory. Can be mounted on the refrig with a great magnet or hung on the wall. It takes a bit of time for your voice recognition but once you've got that set it's so easy. You can even add items that may not be in it's library. You can also note how many of each item and if you have a coupon. Press the print button and your off to the store."
3,Handy but not highly cutting edge electronic,I gave this product for gifts for Christmas. Most people liked it but the biggest complaint I heard was that the voice recognition was not very good at all...especially if there is any background noise...which is inevitable if you have a busy family where you could really use one of these things. And don't even think about having an accent or high or low pitched voice. Other than that most people liked it and are using it.
2,too time consuming,"This is a good idea and I really hoped it would help my family help me with the shopping list. However, It takes too much time to put a new item in the memory, after repeating the name of the item over and over and concluding that it was not in the data base. It's easier to leave a written list."
4,Great idea!,"I really love this product. The body is sturdy and has magnets so you can hang it on the fridge. I love this idea as I often think of things I need while I'm cooking or cleaning and it'll be great to record them on the fly.The paper is the size of a register receipt, but reads very clearly. The machine sorts your list into categories to make it easier on you at the grocery store. You can even tag an item to remind you that you have a coupon.I would recommend this product. Half the battle of grocery shopping is putting a list together, so this is extremely helpful."
5,SmartShopper is a smart purchase!,"These gadgets work really well. I received one for Christmas last year and love it so much I am ordering them for gifts to give this year! Anyone can add items to the shopping list when they use the last of a product and when you go to the store, everything is on the list and in order by department. I highly recommend it, however, you do have to calibrate it to your voice at first and must keep noise down when you are entering items."
2,Not very satisfied,It does not recognize simple words (like chicken). The idea is good but they need to work on the quality.
5,Great device to own,"Everything worked exactly as it should. No issues with an inability to recognize my voice on items. It has capability of 2 lists, and prints out your grocery list by Produce, Condiments, etc. Wonderful! I'm so glad I didn't buy the more expensive model. I can't imagine what it does that this little unit can't do."
3,"So close to a good thing, but frustrating","I've had this gadget for about 17 months now. I love the idea, but execution needs tweaking. Being able to change the order of the categories so they match the aisles in your store is awesome! But I get more and more frustrated every time I speak into it and it doesn't recognize an item I know full well is in its database. I end up giving up and trying just to remember whatever it is by the time I get to the store."
3,twippy,"THIS ITEM IS SENSATIVE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ADD A PRODUCT TO LIST,SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET IT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING YOU WHAT TO ADD TO LIST.THE FIRST ONE I HAD NEEDED TO BE REPLACED,THE BATTERIES WENT AND COULD NOT GET IT TO WORK AFTER I PUT NEW BATTERIES IN IT.THEY RELUCTENTLY SENT ME A NEW ONE,I DO NOT THINK IT IS WORTH WHAT THEY CHARGE FOR THIS"
2,"Spinach, Spinag, SPINACH, SSSSSPPPPIIIINNNNNACHHHHH","Well, my wife bought this thing and while it is totally worthless for it's intended purpose and has a user interface and form factor reminiscent of a low budget sci fi film, I do have to give it 2 stars for the endless laughter and entertainment it has brought my family and I while we listen to my wife yelling at it from the kitchen....."
4,Great Product,"So far it is so handy on the side of my fridge. Occasionally does not recognize a word, but usually due to too much background noise. Maybe someday they will add more lists, which could be helpful. I use unused envelopes (the kind that come in mail with everything!) for my written list and coupons, but now I just tape the printout on the outside and READY TO GO! Very pleased with it and reasonable price."
2,Nice if it worked better,"This worked pretty well the first time I tried it. Now it doesn't recognize anything. I have tried adjusting the sensitivity and saying the words to the library for recognition but still not having much luck. I just got frustrated, hand wrote my shopping list and went to the store. I am still hoping to get the bugs worked out but haven't had the free time to try."
1,Very cheap and seams to be already opened,Purchased brand new. When opened - two of four soft pads missing.Display missing several lines of pixels.Much easier to get pen and paper ready and start writing!Returned it ASAP
4,Smart Shopper,"The samrt shaopper has turned out to be one of the most helpful things I have ever purchased. My wife is disabled and has cognitive problems so when we would get to the store, or even when she was trying to make a list she would forget some things. Being able to just speak into the system anytime you discover you need an item, and then print out the list prior to leaving home sure has made shopping much easier. The only problem,and it is a small on is the occassionally you have to repeat what you want many times before it is recognized by the unit, or use another term so it wil list it. But this is very minor."
3,Not bad,Not a bad product. it is kind of annoying trying to enter items. you have to repeat the item like 5 times and it still doesn't pick it.
3,Smart Shopper,"We were very excited to receive our smart shopper tool. Unfortunately not all items that we use are on the index library, plus we are having voice recognition problems for items that are on the index.We are using the product, but not to the full capacity of our requirements.Thank you,"
4,THIS ITEM SO FAR IS NOT VOICE RECOGNIZABLE,"I am having a difficult time getting this product to recognize my voice. The concept would be a 5 star but I could not give it that because it does not understand anything that I say unless I repeat it several times. I have followed the directions speaking clearly, having friends do the same, but so far nothing has helped. I purchased two of these planning to give one as a Christmas present. Hopefully with more practice I can get it up and working. If so I will write another review and wll indicate how I finally got it to work. In the meantime I hope others who bought this product will give their input and tell me what if anything I am doing wrong."
1,Good idea bad performance,"Bought this little beauty for a christmas present for my wife. She is about ready to smash it into little pieces. voice recognition is poor. An item as simple as ""banana"" required us to speak it 3-4 times before it was recognized. We could have written it down and went to the store and bought the banana and got home in the time it took for this device to recognize the word. I will be calling this company requesting a refund."
1,Very Disappointed,"This product does not work and does not make organizing your grocery list anything but frustrating. However it did give our family a lot of comic relief - instead of an expensive new-techno kitchen gadget for our mom for Christmas, I would classify this as a family game. We hear our mom clearly stating ""bread"" and the item confirms ""noodles"". No one could contain their laughter - ""ketchup...confirm salad dressing"". The cost, frustration and disappointment eventually over-rode the humor."
3,Good in some respects,"It is not very good at recognizing words the first time they're spoken, which makes it awkward to use. The sorting of items on the printout is very useful."
3,Harder to train then expected,"Thought this would be the answer to the clutter of notes and forgotten items. It sort of is. It is not as easy as walking by, pushing the button, and loading in the order. By and large very few come up on the 1st try, even items that have been selected before. Any noise in the background will confuse it as well.Neither of us have any accent so that is not the problem. Nor does distance from the speaker or volume seem to make any difference.But we are persistant and hoping that we will soon find the magic trick that makes it work better for us, so we decided not to return it."
2,Limes!,"This item is an interesting concept, but, like the Newton, it suffers from voice recognition issues. I bought this about two months ago based on the mostly positive reviews, but was a bit dubious. It is certainly an aid for most household items, but can ANYBODY OUT THERE get it to respond to 'limes', even after attempting to teach it that word? Too pricey for what it is able to accomplish, but may be of use so long as you can glue a post-it to the printout for limes, or create one of its suggestions for limes, like lemons or muffins (? Go figure). Too expensive for a throwaway, but that is ultimately what it is."
1,Great Concept / Inferior Product,"I loved the concept behind the Smart Shopper Grocery List Organizer; however, the product does not work at all. The voice recognition worked about 2% of the time. I had everyone in my family try repeatedly, and the product could not pull up a single word correctly. I believe that you can customize every single word into your own voice recognition, but who has that kind of time? And then it does not recognize anyone else's words. At that rate, it's just easier to grab a pen and pencil and write down your grocery list.The product would be a fun one, if they could improve on the accuracy of the voice recognition."
1,Item is too hard for elderly to use,"We bought this for my 85 year old father. He had a lot of trouble with it. When he put in say soup, it gave him options and the print was such that he couldn't read it fast enough before the prompt was gone. When he tried to hang it on the refrigerator he somehow opened it and the paper fell out. He was very frustrated with it and that is why I have returned it. It sounded really good to me but he just wasn't going to use it."
1,Nuts,"I should have kept the box because I would have sent it back!!!! It will not record what I say, so far only five items have shown up correctly. I've tried doing it all different ways except standing on my head to see if it will record. NOPE!!! My husband has tried recording and same thing. It is frustrating because I so desire to have it work but five items in over one month. Come on.Caroline"
3,"SmartShopper OK, barely","Seemed to work easily until it did not recognize item. Directions are clear and easy to follow but adding items to the list takes long. You have to use arrow keys to spell out the new item. Also training to improve recognition for items already in the list is a pain. There are times when my wife has said that it is just too frustrating, its easier to use a pen. When it does work well, the ability to print out the list is awesome. It is easy to erase the list, item, or start a new list. Also can gave two lists. We usually don't need that but it could come in handy."
3,Recognizes most words,"Purchased this for my wife for Christmas. It seems to recognize her voice more than mine. Still a few words like ""yogurt"" and ""waffles"" that the product voice recognition has a hard time with. Overall - still a good purchase and convenient for grocery shopping."
4,Not quite as new as advertised,"It works quite well, but was one of the older models that does not allow two separate lists to be created simultaneously. The instruction booklet was stained so it was obvious that it was not new or nearly new. I gave it as a gift to my daughter. It, on the other hand was considerably less pricey than a new one"
5,Functional & Fun,I bought this for a close friend and she absolutely loves it. It seems as though all the people in the household try to outrun each other to the refrigerator to use it. Voice recognition is excellent. So far it has been a month and the batteries are still holding up. A great gift and product. It seems she has told everyone she knows how much she loves this product (even perfect strangers in the grocery store). Keep up the good work.
4,SmartShopper,"This gadget is great! There are some newer products that won't show up on it, but other than that it is great!"
4,Grocery list organizer,"Great little product; however, it is sometimes difficult to enter the product you want. The voice recognition is not perfect. Sometimes you need to repeat simple things (like ""eggs"") several times before it understands what you are saying."
2,Not Quite,I am sorry I do not like to write less than positive reviews but this item is one I can not endorse. 2 Stars for the innovative idea but the technology is not quite there yet. I don't want to say butter 3 times and have a list of choices come up sometimes w butter sometimes without....I gave as a gift and it was given back to me to return.
2,Prehastoric Technology,"Prehistoric TechnologyI purchased the SmartShopper thinking that the technology was a bit outdated. I was right! Although SmartShopper is a new concept I am not pleased with it. I am returning it because it didn't suite my needs. SmartShopper didn't categorize foods correctly when I hit ""print"". I had to repeat numerous items to get the right one because it only gives you three items to choose from. There should be a color screen and a way to interact and customize your grocery list etc.... I didn't find it suitable for me and my needs. Maybe Im asking too much but this product could be better evolved. Honestly, its not worth my money and if it ever become more consumer specific with evolved technology then I would consider purchasing it. I think it's a waste of time and money for the output of the product."
1,"BOY! Does this suck, or what?",I bought this for my wife....I thought it was a nifty idea. Too bad IT SUCKS! My wife is from CA so she does not have a Bronx accent as I do. Maybe it understands GUAMESE? It sure doesn't understand English. Maybe it's an illegal alien.........STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!
2,List Organizer is Quirky,"While the organizer seems to work, you need to speak what you want several times to get it recognized. Sometimes when it does, choosing select does not respond. Best feature is the sort so you can shop easier."
2,Disappointment,"I think that the concept of this product is intrigueing, however the reality is less than as portrayed. The product has POOR vocabulary recognition relative to many of the simplest of terms,ie: ham produces ""hammer,camera & pail"" ?? Milk produces ""rope, ladle & rolls""??avocado produces cocoa, hot cocoa & alcohol ?? etc. I cannot imagine why I purchased such a frustrating product."
1,I must speak a foreign language,"I bought these as Christmas gifts and am very upset that they do not work as I thought they would. I kept one for myself, and I have to say I am very disappointed in it. If I say, ""Yogurt"", I get ""Deodorant"". If say things that I know are on the list, and I get ""Not in library"" or something totally different than what I said. If I try to add something, it doesn't come up after I put it in. Hopefully, the ones I gave as gifts to not operate as poorly as the one I kept for myself."
4,It really does work,"This product really does work as advertised. The pre-loaded list of items is impressive. And it's not difficult to train the device to recognize new items. One tip: Try to speak as naturally as possible. I've noticed that if you over-enunciate, sometimes the device gets confused. Pears sounds to it like jars, for example. I think the device tends to focus on syllables, as opposed to individual letters, so talk normally to it. When my partner taught it half-and-half, he didn't try to say each word. He just said, ""haf-n-haf,"" the way he normally would. Also, don't pre-suppose that there are individual items it doesn't know. For example, it doesn't just recognize ""cheese."" It knows many kinds of cheeses. The device comes with a book that lists all of the pre-programmed words, but I've found few words that it doesn't know."
4,Smartshopper Grocery List Organizer,This is very handy although there are some problems with the names of items such a chicken soup. I know I can program that phrase in but haven't taken the time to do that. The soup catagory is just that - soup - no distinction as to kind.
1,great idea--just doesn't work,"I bought this for my wife---she's much more savy than i am regarding techie things---product seemed very well made---sturdy and nice finsh--very attractive---instruction manual was good---only big problem was voice recognition---we live in the midwest and have pretty much ""six o'clock news anchor"" accents so I don't think that's the issue---just couldn't recognize half the words we said---maybe each unit is a little different but this one just didn't do it for us---sent it back and Amazon was very quick to refund---so i was out just my shipping and hand. If they get this problem (which is a BIG one) solved--this would be a fantastic product!!!"
1,Needs to be re-engineered,"After the first time I had to replace the paper in the machine, I was never able to get the paper to feed out of the machine again."
1,"Bad,Bad,Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!","P.O.S.!!!!!!! and the advertising is misleading. After speaking the item you must chose the correct item from a list of like and not so like items, If your lucky. Because the voice recognition system is the pits.On a good day it's about 50/50. Keep the pencil and paper."
1,Don't Bother,I love gadgets so I was thrilled when I came across the Smart Shopper List Organizer. What a disappointment when it arrived. The first one I received didn't work properly so they had me send it back. I paid the shipping back and they gave me two additional rolls of paper to use for printing lists. When I received the second one.........the ink was dry so it didn't print the list properly. Got busy and didn't send it back (shame on me)so I'm out the cost and stuck with a product that I consider a sham.
2,"Smartshopper - great idea, needs work","I love the idea of this product - I only wish it would work better. The print out is organized according to categories, which is a nice touch. However, it frequently does not recognize the product you are speaking and the choices it gives you don't even remotely relate to the item you spoke. When it recognizes what you are saying, it's great. When it doesn't (which, in my case, is at least 50% of the time), it's very frustrating and easier just to get a pencil and a piece of paper and write the shopping list the old-fashioned way!"
2,Difficult,We found this to be more difficult to use than to keep a written list. The voice recognition wasn't very good. It was necessary to repeat words numerous times before the device recognized the item. We sent it back.
2,Be nice if it understood English,"This is a clever device that could be truly useful. However, its voice recognition ability is lacking. You'll likely get ""Ketchup"" to list but not ""Motor Vehicle; ""Fudge"" becomes ""Fritos. You get the idea. It has a teaching function that can improve word recognition; yet that is tedious to use and should not be necessary for common shopping items and tasks.SmartShopper does have a surprising ability to amuse with eccentric responses to common words.Nice idea, just doesn't work for us."
3,Smart Shopper,"The Smart Shopper was a Xmas gift for my Mom. Its simple and easy to use. The only drawback and its quite a big one is it doesn't always understand your words. That can be quite frustrating and thats the reason for the 3 stars. It only understands about half of what we say. We've tried my voice, her voice, my son's voice and none of us work 100% of the time. So if you have several people in your household, this product might work for you. When we did get it to work - its actually very cool."
1,Doesn't work well,"This machine does not work well. I have to repeat myself 5 times and it still doesn't get it right. I speak clearly and I am from Chicago, so I don't really have a weird accent or anything. Also, what's the point in owning this if I have to keep adding words to it's dictionary? Takes more time than writing it down. What a pain! Glad it was a gift, I didn't pay for it."
2,Loved it at first......no longer works correctly,At first I loved this product. Yeah it struggles sometimes with words but usually if I hand it over to my husband it understands him and vice versa. But now I'm heartbroken because the screen is malfunctioning. The writing no longer shows up clearly. It's past the 90 day warranty so I'm out of luck. It stays on my fridge and has fresh batteries. I just wish it lived up to the hype. Not sure if I'm willing to chance trying the new one coming out.
4,SmartShopper grocery list organizer,"The product works well. The voice recognition isn't the best but you can make modifications. Only complaint I have is the organization of the printed list. The printout by category is confusing when shopping since some items in a single category are found in multiple aisles. You can alter the list to match your grocery stores aisles, but I find that to be too time consuming. I would like to be able to print a list alphabetically. Over all I'm satisfied with the smartshopper."
1,smartahopper,I don't know if it's something I am doing wrong or if it's the product.Every time I record it says item not listed try again.I keep trying with different items and I keep getting the same response.If anyone has a solution for me I would be glad to hear from them.
1,Too expensive,"The Pixar Cars characters from Mattel can be purchased from Target, Walmart or Toys R Us for around $3.50. Don't be taken in by these rip-off merchants. These are not in short supply and can be found with patience."
1,Ridiculous Prices!!!,"Over the past few weeks my husband and I have managed to find every Cars character except Chick Hicks; and we haven't paid more than $4.00 for any of them. We even have all of the other ""rare"" cars. We bought them at Wal-Mart, Target, and Toys-R-Us. These toys are awesom, but these sellers, and Amazon for that matter, are absolutely ridiculous. They are hoarding this toys and keeping them away from the children that they were intended for, just in hopes that some collector might pay this price for them. I wish Disney would flood the marget with these toys."
1,So True!!,"All the above comments are SO TRUE! I can't believe the prices on Amazon. I too have been running back and forth to Walmart, Kohls, KB Toys trying to get the whole collection. I Am also missing Chick.. But, I won't resort to these tactics. The normal selling price is $3.99 - these sellers should be ashamed!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,This review is NOT for the toy but for the price. Try Ebay if you can't find them at the local walmart or target. OR wait until after the holidays - no kid needs a $20 plus car to play with.The toy itself is just fine - typical of any other toy car.Buyer beware
5,Chick Hicks,I was very pleased to be able to fing this car for my grandson. His was lost and we weren't able to find him one locally.
2,Way too much $,"Keep looking! If you want it bad enough just keep checking the stores. One place I would have never thought of looking was Younkers. I went in there mid-January and they were fully stocked even with the hard to find woody and buzz, hamm, etc...They were higher than walmart, but a lot less than this."
5,GREAT FAMILY FUN!!!!!!!,"My Story Book is such great fun for the whole family. My daughter (7rys) and I sat down and wrote two stories and filled out all the pages with her information, such as her favorite color, drew pictures of her friend and herself, there is even a page to dedicate the stories to. There is another version of this for more where you have to send the book off to come back as a hardcover. I may try that next, but this is fun if you want instant gratification. I also like it because you can choose your own pictures, we used our digital camera to illustrate along with her own drawings and some prints off our photo shop. This would make a great gift to grandparents, parents and other family members that don't live close by."
3,An Expensive Little Coloring Book with Glittery Stickers,"This is essentially a very thin coloring/activity book of only 29 pages. Each page has descriptive words or words that tell you what to do, so you can read those to your little one. At $2.99 retail, it's pretty expensive for such a small coloring book. I have been able to obtain My Little Pony full size coloring books of 94 pages at the 99 cents store. The best thing about this book is the 8 1/2"" x 11"" sheet of glitter stickers of 6 ponies and various flowers and butterflies included with it."
5,Pony Parade,"This book is basically a ""coloring book"" with stickers! Great book for many hours of fun!"
5,St John Passion composed with passion,"I hagve had this CD for a few years now, and it still amazes me with each listen. The work can be trying for over an hour, but if you stick with it, what a rewarding experience! The last 15 minutes are utterly heartbreaking. It'll bring a tear to your eye. It did to me. It's the only piece I've heard that makes me well up. Superb job by Arvo Pärt, and the Hilliard Ensemble yet again shows their aptitude for the music."
1,Sonic tranquilizer,"If Pfizer could figure out how to put Arvo Part's music into a pill, they'd corner the market on sleeping aids. I've listened to this CD 10-15 times in its entirety, trying to pay close attention to the nuances of text and phrasing. I don't see the appeal of music like this, which is as grey and monochromatic as the front cover of the CD booklet.I must note, however, that the singing (particularly that of the Evangelist) is breathtakingly beautiful. Recording quality is also outstanding; you feel as if you're sitting in a deserted church on a cold, windy day."
1,if only zero stars were an option,"what a long, boring, droning, soporific, tuneless, piece of junk! one track, one hour of droning in LATIN-- any hint of melody is probably an hallucination... i feel cheated with this purchase-- what a waste of money! awful! do not buy this unless death by boredom is your aim."
1,Not a good choice,"The AMT/Ertl ""Star Trek"" vinyl figure models of the original series cast were all plagued by somewhat shaky likenesses & stiff poses, compounded by some parts of the figures being out of scale to other parts. Not recommended unless you like doing a LOT of resculpting."
4,A Shirt For The Gym,"As I received this as a Christmas gift, I have been able to slip it on and head over to the gym already. The result? Well, I must say, I have recieved the looks and comments that I was hoping for. ""Now that's a shirt!"" ""Go Homer"" and ""Donuts"" being my favorites.This one has the look and feel of an athletic shirt, and is perfect for underachievers everywhere. Show em' you don't care, wear Homer!Four Stars!"
5,Another great performance,"This CD has quickly become one of my very favorites. As always with the York Waits, the program is very enjoyable and the added bonus of Richard Wistreich's singing and recitation is a special treat. My only quibble with this CD (and it is a minor one) is the balance between selections. Relatively quiet numbers are followed by very loud ones, so one is forever having to turn the volume up and down to accomodate. That said, if you like vernacular English music of the 16th century this CD would be an excellent addition to your library."
1,Memorex MK1980 14 Channel FRS 2-Way Radio,"I bought a pair of these less than a year ago and haven't used them much at all. On a skiing trip last month, one of them just quit working. It hadn't been abused or mis-treated in any way.To add insult to injury, I've emailed Memorex 4-5 times about the problem and they haven't responded at all.Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,"Taste Great, less filling -- good for the laughs","These body chocolates aren't all that they'er cracked up to be. The only reason it didn't get 1 star is because the brush is of great quality. I know my chocolate, and this tasted like I was eating chocoalte syrup that I put on my ice cream. It is super thick too, not only does your tongue get tired after a while, but it is hard to paint -- isn't that supposed to be the purpose. Because it is so thick, it leaves a ""very"" sticky residue on the body. With all that being said, I would still use it though. Why? Well because it's fun. But if you want a sensuous experience, this probably isn't the way. You'll end up sharing more awkward laughter than anything. THen again, if that's what your looking for then this will probably get 5 stars from you. Good luck and enjoy."
1,Sony ECM-HQP1 Surround Sound Microphone,"Although the sounds it records are very life-like, this microphone's HUGE amount of background hiss makes it totally unusable. I originally bought this microphone for my new Sony DVD camcorder. The result was beautiful video with sound that was reminiscent of a 1960's mono cassette recording with lots of tape hiss. This is not what I expect for a totally digital video and sound recording. I went back to the original built-in microphone, which has no audible hiss at all, and am much happier."
1,Sony ECM-HQP1 - Surround Sound Microphone,This didn't function up to our expectations and didn't serve our purposes. Unless we were recording one-on-one interviews with the camera/microphone directly on the person we couldn't get good voice reception. In attempting to record a group setting it was of no value. We had to purchase an alternate device.
2,Waste of money,"I bought this product to use with my Ergo carrier. Waste of money! Yes it protects from the sun great, but once tied on it is not wide enough to protect my little ones legs. I find it easier to use my own blanket which is wide enough to wrap around his whole body. Perhaps it would work better with other carriers, but not with Ergos."
5,GOOD ITEM. worth every penny,dont expect it to be a commercial grade machine.it does cover all my duties at home shop. very happy with it
1,One sorry piece of equipment.,This is one sorry piece of equipment that I was not able to return when it quit working after the third use. This item is not something you would use everyday so the return length of time is not approriate. As stated above -- I only used this three times and now it is a piece of trash. Very unsatisfied with the quality and the seller of this product. As a matter of fact I would not even rate it with one star except you have to pick atleast one.
3,OK for small repairs,"I found this stick welder good for VERY small jobs, like tack welds. Don't expect to do more with it. It only uses small welding rods and it overheats and kicks off after a minute or two if you try to use it continuously. Don't expect to build a barbeque grille with it! Also, go right to high power to strike an arc or you'll end up with a bunch of rods stuck to your workpiece!"
3,"1/8"" projects only","Can't do any type of frame work because it only does 1/8"" steel max. It also shuts off after about 1 1/2 inches on a proper bead, so long beads or whatever aren't good with this."
1,This Toner Sucks,"I tried 2 cartridges on my 8150n and they all leak, or the cheap clips they use on it fall off. I highley recommend not using this brand for any printer"
5,john hopkins health book,"Excellent resource for various health issues. Succinct and to the point. When I'm looking for answers/explanations, I always find the information in this book. And, the thorough index makes it easy to find answers."
4,"BIG UNIT ,WITH GOOD POWER","Bought this impact wrench a few days ago and all I can say is itsvery well made , but its a little too big and bulky to be used inconfind spaces but its great for lug nuts and old rusty boltsthat you can get to . The batteries on these units are by far thebest I have seen. long lasting and quick recharge time, and Itshard to beat the 5 yr warrenty ."
4,Milwaukee 28 volt impact wrench,"I just bought this tool to use as a road service assist tool in my race car trailer. It was rated at over 200 ft.lbs. of torque which should have been more than adequate to remove lug nuts that were torqued on at 95 ft.lbs. Alas, the impact wrench just hammers away without breaking loose the lug nuts. I still need to use a breaker bar and loosen the initial torque manually. I have been using Milwaukee tools for 35 years and have very seldom been disappointed in one. This will still be a useful tool, I just wish the power would have been rated accurately."
5,FREE BREAK - DANCE LESSONS,"With the battery Pack actually installed on the tool ,this tool has unbeatable POWER and ENDURANCE. I've mostly used the pneumatic variety, this has comparable power,but is portable,although big and heavy.I was laying under my truck loosening some rusted bolts,before I dug my heels in,I was Break Dancing -20 years too late!And as usual Great prices and service from Amazon."
1,Doesn't work,"Like the other 1 star reviews, this wrench won't remove lug nuts hand torqued to 80-100 ft/lbs. It just hammers away and the battey dies before all 5 lug nuts were attempted. I'm about to send it back for repair to the authorized repair center. Don't waste your money. I hope I can report back that it was fixed... but I think the torque values are greatly over-rated. It does seem to drive nuts on just fine because it gets up to speed, but loosening? Forget it."
5,Best cordless impact ever,"This tools has juice to spare, plenty of torque and the battery last a long time, I've used Snap-on and Dewalts cordless impacts and nothing comes closer to the Milwaukee 28v, I hope to get a few years of good use out of it."
1,"For lug bolts and nuts, forget it","I bought this as all of my other Milwaukee tools are great. This impact wrench though is worthless for removing lug nuts or lug bolts. On my cars, they are tightened to 96 ft/lbs... this gun couldn't loosen them. Returned to amazon."
1,"Overrated torque, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","I have most of the v28 line and love them. Well not this tool. This tool is a dog. I tried to remove lug nuts on a car. Too Bad. It just sits there hammering away and won't loosten them. So I take it back to an authorized dealer, since I think It's defective. They gave me a new tool. GREAT, I thought. The new tool did take off some lug nuts, sometimes. These are hand tightened torqued lug nuts at 120 Ft-lbs. and it can't spin them off. What? The torque rating is way overstated, If you want to use this on smaller bolts, maybe it would be a wise choice. But I would never recommend this tool to anyone. It's a pretty big tool, but big doesn't mean powerful! Be warned, it doesn't have the power it's stated to have!"
2,MILWAUKEE LIED OVER RATED BUT WORKS DECENT,"Highly overrated tool. Doesn't even come close to the torque specs advertised by Milwaukee. It can take out bolts torqued to about 80 FT/LB.That is the closest it will come to 350 FT/LB? False advertising at the finest by Milwaukee. Don't buy this tool, if you think you can use it for anything over 80 FT/LB.Stay away, far away, not even close!"
1,Not as advertised,After many years of satisfactory use of Milwaukee power tools.I was sadly disappointed. I could not loosen bolts tightened to 150 ft lbs. Big price little power.
5,This one WOWS people,"The response to the video is as amazing as the book! People come out of the woodwork who have an interest in it or the book: Elvis & The Blue Moon Boys. A cousin of a Cadillac recipient, friends or relatives of DJ Fontana, people with ties to one of the band or Elvis, even a Mensa member who's sister was taken to her prom by Elvis. They all love it!Tom CrainThe Coffee Tree Books & Brew"
5,Mummies Italian Charms,"I am interested in Ancient Egypt and the mummification process, so this was a very intriguing little Charm. It looks great on my bracelet."
2,Not What I Expected - Too thin,"Much too thin, flimsy. I was looking for something with more weight. If you are as well, you should probably pass on this product."
2,"20,000 Leagues it Ain't","A fan of the book and of Disneys great film, any new version is welcomed if only to see how the producers would tackle the subject matter and envision the victorian submarine Nautilus. Unfortunately,this version tries to please everyone by modernizing the tale and throwing in every sure-fire idea the writers could think of. Arronax is now a youthful, handsome genius, with a troubled relationship with his father. Nemo is a mad genius,(with a bionic hand!)-who takes him under his wing and becomes a surrogate father figure. Ned land is so desperate to escape he goes looney and smashes the nautilus salon windows drowning in the process. We now get a black man among the cast and an interacial love affair- Arronax loses his hand and gets a mechanical one too. (Star Wars rip -off) Etc, etc. Really- they tried to please everyone. Perhaps the only thing really going for it is thenice production values and interesting design of the Nautilus. Save your money."
1,Warning to Buyers,"I ordered the Rembrandt Plus Peroxide Whitening Rinse based on the description and image offered. The product ABC Wholesale sent me was the replacement ""Rembrandt whitening Mouthwash with Flouride"" in the round white bottle. The product pictured had a pleasant citrus taste, the replacement is a strong mint. ABC Wholesale customer service insisted that the image of the product was not their problem and this was the direct replacement for the Whitening Plus pictured. They also refuse to supply a return label, so I am stuck paying for the return postage."
5,This toy is great!,"I have 2 sons (ages 16 mos. and 2 1/2 yrs.) and both of them love this toy. My older son loves to run down the hallway pushing it as fast as he can. It has been dropped, thrown out of the crib, etc. and still plays like new. The songs on it are different than the other musical toys we have, which is nice. I wouldn't say this toy is really educational, except for learning the musical rhythem. The 3 buttons on the top play the songs one note at a time (no matter which order you press them in). There is also a button on the side to play the whole song. And of course, it plays when you push it. It really is a great toy!!"
2,Not what I expected.,Was disappointed that the puppies were basically chunks of wood faintly resembling dogs...thought they might have more detail or finishing. Would probably pass had I known....
3,Serves its purpose,"This is not an official product. This guy just opens it up and disables the sound and then resells it. It works, or at least mine appears to for now. Hopefully it will continue to until I take the test. However, the light doens't work (not that it matters for my purpose). I don't know if it is just mine or if it is a side-effect of disabling the sound."
1,Is this a serious effort?,Having watched Zone Play 1 I found it to be pretty much utterly useless and dated. God I wish I had a preview. From the moment you are sucked in watching youth players jumping over hula hoops and crawling under chairs you get a serious sense of dread wondering if this is actually what you are seeing. The video doesn't get better. Most of the video features a coach carrying a big stack of papers directing the players with audio dubbed over loosely describing what is going on. The coaching progressions are almost laughable and seriously dated.
5,One of my favorites,"This album, while released in 1988, remains one of my favorites. The list of personnel: Heiner Goebbels, Arto Lindsay, Don Cherry, Fred Frith, George Lewis, Charles Hayward, Ned Rothenberg, and Ernst Stotzner, bespeaks of the potential for quality. The music is adventurous and engaging, but also quite melodic. It is not a noise fest. If you have just a touch of an adventuresome spirit I suggest this one."
2,The book's chapter titles pulled me in but...,"This is not at all the book I expected. I expected a book for busy grown-ups who still have a passion for creating art or perhaps still entertain pretensions of becoming accomplished artists. I know how to make art but can't seem to clear away all the distractions, balance my work priorities with my home life and find enough time left over to make it. I was hoping for some constructive advice that would help me to take up my passion again without sacrificing my career, my ""bread and butter"" and family time. What I felt I got was a basic orientation to art-making overstuffed with various quotes from unknown artists who do not seem to struggle with these same challenges."
1,"How to ""come out"" as an artist...and that's it","This book was way too touchy-feely for me. It's basically a book about how several ""case studies"" (aka, artists I have never heard of, and you probably haven't either) and how they ""came out"" to their friends and family as (semi?) professional artists. If you want a book on that topic, then this is the one for you. If you are looking for something that isn't a ""Here's John's Story"" type of thing, then save your money and keep looking. It is VERY rare for me to not be able to find anything useful in a book, but sadly this book is at its best when used as a coaster."
2,Good basic controller,"This controller works without drivers, it is a 2 in 1, it does not work on all games and does not come with drivers cd or download link. It has the look and feel of ps1 controller. I think for the price and zero configuration required is good to have around the house as it does work with a few games. Just make sure you have either a logitech or microsoft controller handy for the games it does not work on. check out the gaming section over at pcfix411.com and use my amazon store link to purchase items thank you. http://astore.amazon.com/pcfix411com-20"
5,Interesting video,The video provides a good history of the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. It covers the technical and financial problems of the project and how they were solved.
2,Didn't seal completely.,"I bought this to fix some minor oil leaks and it just doesn't work that well. I used it to seal my Camshaft Endplate, Camshaft Sensor and High Pressure fuel pump. Well the Camshaft Sensor still leaks after letting it sit for over 24 hours. I now have to tear it apart again and use some higher quality stuff. I would of given it 1 star if it didn't work at all."
4,Works well,"I didn't use a ton of this, because I had a gasket. Just a few dabs to keep gasket in place. Works as described"
4,Solid Gaskets,Use this on my Honda VTX 1300c clutch cover. Never had any leaks. Love that I can get it for so cheap here on Amazon.
2,Poor piano sound,"The piano sound is dire on this keyboard.It's muffled, and sounds more like a synth trying to sound like a guitar on a couple of notes.I returned mine for refund and bought a Casio CTK-691."
5,Thick oats; not too sweet...,"These oats are nice and thick (like all Bob's red mill granola). This granola is sweet, but not overly so. There is a very light taste of coconut and sesame. There are not too much of either in the granola so if you want a super coconut filled granola you'll have to look elsewhere. However, I find that there is just enough coconut and sesame to make this a perfect breakfast/snack granola."
5,Bob's Coconut Granola,Basic granola product - Bob's usually makes pretty good products...buying on Amazon was decently low price ... expiration date was also reasonable (not true of some other on line purchases I've made). Serving suggestion: get Coconut Beverage (milk like product similar to soy milk) to add to granola. Serving suggestion: add to hot oatmeal AFTER cooking.
4,Yummy!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this granola. I cannot eat raisins or nuts, so I have a hard time finding granola that I CAN eat so I tried this one. Its rather chewy, but I don't mind that. It does NOT have a strong coconut flavor which is a bit disappointing, but otherwise the taste is very good. A little goes a long way, as it is very filling.I love eating it with cold milk for breakfast! I would also recommend keeping it in the freezer, it stays fresher much longer...and can be eaten right out of the freezer without a 'hardness' worry.Recommended."
2,Almost no coconut flavor,"I purchased this product since I like coconut products. However, I was disappointed in that this granola had almost no coconut flavor. On the plus side, it was not extra sweet (like most other granolas) and otherwise had a good flavor. I would not purchase it again."
4,"Good, but...","I did enjoy this granola, but I found the price to be quite unreasonable for the amount of product received. Although the flavor and quality were good, they did not justify the price I paid."
2,bot much to say,Well.. i love granola and I have been eatin' for a long time already... this one does not meet anyone's expectations.. no flavor and it's not sweet enough..Any whow.. I wouldn't recommended it - sorry ;-(
3,ingredients,"the product has a great taste, but I didn't read the ingredients well enough. I have a sulphite problem and did not notice the molasses. I have sense given it away. Everyone reated it well. Just wasn't for me."
3,condition,I have been looking for this book for nearly twenty years and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I do believe however that the condition of the book was a little over estimated.
1,Do Not Buy this table,"This product is a disaster and potentially very dangerous. The materials are cheap and several pieces were missing. Badger sent new pieces but when I assembled it, the tray bases were completely warped and the two pre-assembled end pieces fell apart. Spend a little more and buy something else. Your baby's safety isn't worth saving a few bucks."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"Fact: Table took maybe 25 minutes to put together (one person)Fact: Not the highest quality but you get what you pay forFact: Color on the ""black"" unit was consistentFact: Is sturdy to change a BABY, not a for holding 50 pound weightsFact: If all your looking for is a simple changing table at a low price it worksFact: If you want a permanent changing station that is a solid piece of furniture with top of the line craftmanship you are going to pay a lot more than $100"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ... ITEM,"This is just a bad product whatever way you look at it, uneven color, cracked parts, and mismatching holes. Same parts were either too big or too small, so when putting together you need to break something or leave it loose. The only positive side was that broken parts were replaced for free within a week. Other than that it's just firewood material."
3,Just ok..,I expected it to be a lot thicker wood...the shelves are just particle board:( I was disappointed for the money spent..
1,Imported Junk!,"This piece of junk represents a real problem in the US today... importing junk. We can't ourselves build a simple table that won't fall apart after a month? The only reason this junk costs more than $5 is that they have to cover the shipping costs from China.Looks so pretty in the pictures, huh? Think again. Save your back and the environment and throw your money directly into the garbage."
3,Just okay,"Well, its just okay. It probably should have been a little higher and the platform should have been a little more sturdier. The 3 tier shelving is basically very thin particle board the top one being probably 1mm thicker than the bottom two and they tried to give the apperance of creating a load bearing structure, by adding a thin metal strip as support for the top one where you lay your child to change - but I dont think it will be very safe once the child starts gaining weight. At that point I probably will have to look for something better, this one i think i can break apart by hand to dispose of it - that too, me being not physically fit at all. Are there any safety regulations like the car seats for kid furniture?"
1,poor quality,"Just received and assembled today, overall very poor quality, with gaps between frames and ply wood warp after assemble, I do not recommend anybody to buy it and i am thinking returning it.update: I am returning this item to amazon, the assembled table is not sturdy at all and cannot be used as an changing table, again I don't recommend anybody to buy it."
2,It works,"I think this product looks better in the picture than it does in real life. It does the job though! It holds the baskets I bought for the shelves below and I can change my baby on it. I am just not thrilled with the way it looks. If I had it to do over again, I would probably get a more expensive changing table."
4,not bad---BUT,"...from a functionality standpoint---it's great---easy to put together for most people, and the perfect height---very easy to change a baby on this thing--BUT we had to return two of them becuase the wood was damaged during shipping---the third was STILL damaged but it wasn't too noticable and I figured some wood glue would fix it...Amazon made it right though, so no complaints there---just a bit of a hassle"
3,Ok for the sale price,Changing table is a pretty color. Flimsy parts but strong enough to hold a baby. Changing table is very thin. We will be getting another one. There are several knicks. One very large one. And the stickers are very hard to get off. I hate that!!
1,The smell of FORMALDEHYDE!,"I usually do not bother to leave a review, unless I am extremely satisfied or the opposite. If you care about the health of your baby, don't buy this changing table. Reason? The strong smell of formaldehyde from the paint/wood! I noticed the smell right after we opened the package. Now, after we've put it outside for 10 days, it still has that formaldehyde smell! I cannot believe this item passed the regulation of baby products. Unfortunately I have thrown away the packaging, otherwise I'd definitely return it. Now I'm afraid I have to throw it away. Worst way to spend $90!"
3,Good Changing Table,"Fairly sturdy and inexpensive. We enjoy the dark wood. While assembling, one of the screws didn't reach into the pre-prepared holes with the receiving hardware inside. The table is still sturdy though. We like it."
1,Potentially Dangerous Product,"This product is terrible, do not waste your money. It is extremely unstable and the screws do not allow for the pieces to effectively come together. There are literally gaps at the corners. Fortunately, we were able to return it. Now that my son is an active 1 year old, I am so happy that I made the decision to return it because there is no way it would have been able to hold together during diaper changes and I cringe at the thought of the possibility of it collapsing beneath him."
1,Everything was fine until ...,"I was just about to finish putting it together when the top shelf would not fit in the groove of one of the end pieces. I then took it all apart and noticed that the bottom two shelves were thinner than the top shelf (make sense because the top shelf needs to support the baby); however, the top of ONE of the end pieces was cut for a thinner shelf preventing me from putting it together. So given I could not even get it put together due to a manufacturing flaw, I'd have to recommend staying away from this one."
4,Changing Table,Bought as a gift for my daughter's baby shower. She is happy with it and it wasn't hard to put together. the only thing that would have made it better was to have the baskets that go with it at a reasonable price.
1,BAD QUALITY,"No part of this changing table was quality. The wood looked like it had been dented, scratched and dinged, and looked as if it had just been painted over. I was running my hand along the bottom of one of the legs because it looked bumpy, and a chunk of wood came off in my hand! Thank God it was returnable."
1,Don't purchase,"This table was very difficult to assemble for 2 people even though it states that it can be done by one! The shelves were thin and warped, the finish chipped very easy, the screwholes did not line up, and after my husband, who is a carpenter finally finished, the table swayed from front to back. There was no bracing to prevent this and unless it was bolted to a wall, it is unsafe for a baby to be on. I threw it out and bought a different type of table for my grandaughter. This table was not expensive, but after what we went through to assemble it and seeing the result, I feel as though it should have been FREE!"
1,terrible quality; damaged in shipping,"This table is terrible and I am amazed that it has any positive reviews. The quality is horrible. The corners were not protected in shipping and are all damaged. In addition, the finish is coming off in many places. Also, there are exposed hardware pieces and glue. I question the safety for a baby."
3,Decent changing table for the price.,"The outter frame of the table feels very sturdy, but the shelf-board is a bit ""IKEA"" thin, which I guess is still ok. The only real complaint I have is in the installation of the metal support bar under the top shelf-board. There are no pre-drill holes to screw in the metal bar, which I had to make it myself. This would not be as bad, except the wood is really dense. It broke 1 drill bit and both of the given screws trying to get it in. I ended up using a large drill bit and larger screws in order to get it in with out the screw head twisting off."
4,Adorable and functional,"This changing table was exactly like the picture and description. It's pretty sturdy, easy to assemble (i did so myself at 8months preg.) and it's a perfect size. I'm very happy I ordered this one for this price - a similar one is for sale at Target for $149. This one was such a deal!"
3,Cover Boy,"I'm actually the cover boy on this book. It's my brother and I playing a game called ""door bell."" I don't remember really the point of the game, but it was so much fun playing with my older brother. Several of the games were so much fun that we played them for years before our youth escaped us."
1,damaged product,"I ordered a ""History of Art - The Western Tradition"" from Kelcsmom Co. Instead, I received a used, damaged book today. I am very frustrated that I received a used copy when I specifically ordered a new copy. I am unable to contact the Kelcsmom Co."
3,For The Young!,"This would be a great beginner book for children and young people. But the projects are too homemade craft looking for most adults, in my opinion. There are other books on this subject offered by Amazon for adults, but this is the only book on 3D Decoupage offered for young people."
3,"Ok Cards, but very slippery","We play with regular cards and they take a beating. I thought I would step up our poker games with fancier cards. I read about plastic cards Kem or Copag. Heard a little more cons from Kem's, so decided to try Copag's. It's ok, but cards are slick. Trying to shuffle cards, they fell like you are going to be playing 52 pickup pretty soon. After a few rounds of usage, table went back to regular paper cards. I'm not sure if the Kem cards are any better, but I was disappointed in my first usage of plastic cards."
2,Copags DO Warp!,"I ordered several sets of Kems and Copags for Christmas gifts. I notice some reviews of Kems noted a problem with warping or bowing of the deck after a time (sometimes only 2 months.) when my sister opened her gift of Copag Master Design setup (poker size, standard index) I was extremely surprised to see that both decks in the set were bowed! (Amazon is great, though, and there was no problem in returning the decks for a refund.) For my taste, Kems are one skinny notch above Copags. I don't like the blocky font Copag uses and they are slightly less flexible than Kems. On the other hand I don't like the overly heavy-line Kem face card graphics and I think their fat nose-picking joker looks like a sexual deviant....and his image is blurry and cheap looking."
2,"rather plain, grubby","It's probably unfortunate that I took up this collection after just finishing a collection by the always superb TC Boyle. Ford knows how to write well, but the subject matter leaves him straining for effect. There may be one or two good compassionate stories to write about yuppies cheating on their spouses, but packing a whole book of what can only become redundant (and does by about the fourth story) is a serious drag on the reader. The best story is really the last, The Abyss.I heard another reviewer here praise an earlier collection as superior. I shall head off to the library for that one...."
4,a favorite American author,"The writing here is a great example of modern fiction that is American to it's core. After reading this I had to get more Richard Ford and just finished Independence Day which is like a modern day cross between Moby Dick and Ulysses.The pieces in this book all have the same titillating topic but each treats it from a different angle (and locale) and unravels the consequences in a unique way. The story about the Grand Canyon is jaw-dropping, especially if you've been there. I went back and immediately re-read 'Puppy' too."
5,How it should be.,"Until organs came to churches and hymns began to be sung with ponderous pomposity the 'western gallery bands' were thumping out these classics with jolly abandon. When I heard this record for the first time I thought ""This is how they were meant to be played"". With Maddie Prior's rich and melodious tones and the instrumental wizardry of the Carnival Band this is a delight from end to end; and in the middle are some unexpected special treats such as the 'Appalachian' treatment of How Firm A Foundation. It is wonderful."
1,what a shame,"Such a fine piece of music ruined by bad technology. First copy I got was blank. Complained, received a new one. It starts out fine but later cuts are just loud noises. I gave up!She's a great singer; a unique sound. What a waste of talent!"
3,baby born can be safe enywhere she is now,hilast week i got this carrier at mr toy toy shop and i love it .i take her for sleepovers at my friends and to the shops and i even use it as a bed . if you are looking for to get foryour self or to your dauter get this. you will love it the seat belt goes in the space's and it does't move around in the car and it does't take up any room.Zapf this is an asome product tat you have.
2,awkward,"My almost 4 year old loves her Baby Born doll and was thrilled to receive this seat for her. However, the seat is never played with as my daughter finds it difficult to carry her doll around in it. It's clearly too heavy and too awkward as well as not really very practical."
3,Christmas present for two year old,This car seat is heavier than I had anticipated. The new born baby doll I purchased for Christmas almost doesn't fit. The straps are going to be to hard for her until she gets a little older. This toy really is for an older child.
5,Great accessory for Baby Born Doll,"I got this toy for my 5 year old for Christmas to go along with the Baby Born Doll she was getting from Santa. She has had a wonderful time with this seat. She brings it everywhere with her and straps the doll into the car with a seatbelt, as there are strap holders attached to the seat. I think this has been a wonderful way for her to feel more like a mama and helps in her ability to care for the doll she loves so much."
5,best book for football trainig i ever read,"This book is awesome, it is very detailed and goes along great w/my school schedule.Workouts are easy to understand. He made the workouts short and simple so your spending your whole day wondering how to excel football. Ben Cook gives it to straight and simple on how to be the best you can at football.Only one thing wrong he should've got more focused on nutrtion, alot of kids that start training dont know anything about training , and nutrtion. The training aspect in this book is great, but was looking for help in nutrition too, but overall book is excellent!"
3,was a gift,this was a gift for my nephew who loves football and right after opening this was outside with wieghts and jump ropes and stuff planning his workouts...cool:)
2,A Little More Information...,"If you're like me, you searched Amazon for ""silk road"" and this came up in the list. The description is pretty brief, so here's some more info on what you'll get:*It's a Chinese documentary with Chinese narration and English subtitles.*The emphasis is on the Hexi Corridor and its growth over time. The Central Asian and Western portions of the Silk Routes aren't really covered.*The footage is almost entirely modern-day shots of historical locations.*The material isn't presented in a way that's structured or easy to follow. There's a lot of trivia, and it's integrated with more general material very haphazardly.This might be useful if someone wanted to see video of a bunch of locations along the Hexi Corridor. As a general video about the Silk Road, I can't recommend it."
5,I couldn't stop reading!,"Red River Rising offers great journalism and an enthralling read in the same package. I kept saying to myself, ""Just one more page..."" Shelby presents a masterful overview of the disaster and brings all of the people to life, too. A terrific book."
1,River of Errors,"Before buying this book or especially before considering everything in it as factual, consider this:A University of North Dakota history professor wrote a several thousand word review of this book in the April 18 Grand Forks Herald. The title of her veview: ""A River of Errors"".Among many other errors, Shelby could not even correctly spell the name of the governor of North Dakota.Read Dr. Porter's review for the perspective of someone who was actually there.Dave HauschildAndover, MN."
5,superb book!!!,"I picked this book up as a gift for a friend who lived through the flood and I became so engrossed in it I never put it in the mail! (I bought another copy for my him. ) As well as being hugely infomative, there was a richness of detail and character that gave it the feel of a gripping novel.The book brought home for me the true devastion of the flood, which I had of course heard about, but could not truly fathom until Red River Rising.I was surprised to read another Amazon reviewer (and local) say: ""There is a sense throughout the book that North Dakota residents are hicks waiting on federal hand outs, too stupid to purchase flood insurance, and too easily swayed by a newspaper column.""It's a strange comment. You could only conclude the person read a different book. Red River Rising reads as nothing less than a moving tribute to the intelligent, proud, generous and above all courageous people of Grand Forks.I recommend it highly!"
3,It's more for kids...,"Me - as I would myself count as a fan of the real Godzilla - was somehow disappointed by the movies. These movies are clearly targeted to kids and contain a lot of scenes which are nice for kids but not so much for adults. The quality of FX is - according to my impression - cheaper and worse than those of the 60's movies. I got the impression the movies are somehow mass production style with cheap CG FX. Made without 'love'. The kids who are going to a forgotten city under the sea are filmed on a relatively 'cheap' sound stage and you can see it - mass production, cheap series type. The only thing I found nice: Mothra is changing it's outlook and capabilities several times until it can beat the 'evil' creature. Well, IMHO not for the serious fan of Godzilla movies but OK for the completeness of the collection."
2,NOT IN JAPANESE!!,The technical details say the audio track is Japanese. It isn't. The audio is dubbed English. I order Japanese DVDs with English subtitles so I can learn Japanese. If that's why you want to order this movie -- don't!
2,"Once again, ruined by wide screen","Good concept for monster movies directed at children, however even my kids could not truly enjoy the wide screen ratio. When will these Co. wise up and put them out both ways on one disc, preferably. then everyone can enjoy it, from the wide screen freakazoids back down to the full screen dimensia people."
3,"It's nice, but","It's nice to have all these '90s Toho monster movies finally available in the US, and it's certainly worth the money, but I am disappointed with this DVD.It doesn't have any extras, not even trailers, and it escapes me why they couldn't include the original Japanese soundtrack in addition to the dubbed English one. How much would it have increased costs to include an audio track that already existed?"
5,"Magical, exciting, and brilliant","The Rebirth of Mothra 1&2 double feature DVD is a perfect introduction to Mothra's adventures at their best. Moll and Lora, the tiny twin fairies of Infant Island, must stop Belvera, their evil sister. Belvera plans to use the ancient monster, DesGhidorah, to transform the earth into a wasteland. However, Lora and Moll have a plan of their own; to summon Mothra to combat DesGhidora and save the earth. Then, in Rebith of Mothra 2, Belvera plans to pollute the earth's oceans with a new ancient monster, Dagahra. Moll and Lora once again plan to summon Mothra and save earth and it's inhabitants. This is a must have for kaiju fans."
5,Great movie for Mothra fans,"If you enjoy Mothra, then you'll like this one. Both one and two included. Good quality picture included selected scenes."
4,Mothras single movie,"MOTHRA finally gets another movie named after her without having to share it with godzilla and boy she lets it shine....BRIGHTLY, mothra takes on a crutaceous Ghidorah in the first one when it tries to take all the life away from earth and the effects are good, minus the fact that kids are involved, but it makes for a good childrens movie....either way...it's a winner, and part 2 has her taking on a monster gone wrong, the monster was an experiment of ancient people for protection but went array soon after, comes back, and tries to destroy the temple in which brought it there, mothra is summoned again and transforms into a better mothra (the abilities i won't give away) and this mothra too has alot to do with kids but it's a winner just the same, anyway....they are definitley collectors items....I cannot wait till' rebirth of mothra 3 is back here in the states and on DVD"
1,Don't do it unless you are a true fan,"Mothra of course is a classic TOHO monster...so when Godilla took a breather in 1995...they thought Mothra could pick up the slack.....well, no....The Toho monsters are always interesting, but these are bad movies and the effects are not good either....If you are a fan go for it...if not...step away!"
2,Almost readable,"Veterinarian Lillian Roberts needs to spend more time in reviewing practice management and researching facts. As a veterinarian,Cavalier King Charles owner and dog show attendee, I have never seen a tailess King Charles. They aren't Cocker Spaniels....And I certainly hope Dr. Roberts is more careful in her actual practice with controlled substances like morphine.....Not a bad read, but as a veterinarian I was appalled at the actions of the protagonist Dr. Pauling in providing anything other than acute emergency care in a non-human primate without adequate training."
3,A Liberal Vents,John Crosby can really write. He can turn the ordinary into a very entertaining story. But his knee jerk liberalism is woefully out of date and you have to know your history in order to enjoy this book. His constant complaining about the state of the world also gets to be a little much.
3,pretty easy,"I purchased this as a fun game to play when we travel. Our youngest is 14, oldest 22, so we all thought it was pretty easy, But it is still fun."
3,doesn't cover whole bible,"I wish it covered more of the bible, but then it would be larger and more money. I still wish it was larger."
4,stocking stuffer,"Bought this for my 11 year old's stocking. Good questions, some easy / some hard. We enjoyed going over them together. Wish there were more questions."
5,excellent,"I first saw this at an IMAX theater in Charlotte museum.Great discussion on the environment of the reefs, and breathtaking shots underwater. Also makes you more aware of the negative affects we are having on our natural resources. Great movie!"
4,From a Diver,"Fantastic vistas, interesting commentary and much to learn from this educational video. I gave it as a gift to my parents who have never been diving but love the sea. They were fascinated by the incredible photography."
4,Coral Reef Adventure,"First off, the underwater video is flat out wonderful. Howard Hall is simply the best there is. There's just a little too much about the filmmakers and film making included, though, which distracts from the rest of the video somewhat.A very nice feature is an included ""montage"" of nothing but scenery. I like to put that on and watch it with my morning coffee."
1,disappointing WMVHD,"this is a nice movie, but the HD content is very difficult to retrieve. Seems to be very system dependent if it actually works or not."
5,Coral Reef IMAX DVD,"Great viewing! Color is amazing. We have a projector with a 102"" screen. Awesome to be under the sea!"
3,Beautiful Photography,"Beautiful scenes and decent high definition, but the music is too loud and overwhelms."
4,Great picture quality,It's a great to have HD content even before the HD-DVD or Blue Ray discs start shipping. Picture and sound quality are great. I don't see any difference betwen the 720p and 1080p resolutions although my projector is only 720p.
3,Acceptable but not outstanding,"I actually thought this was the Howard Hall IMAX video. While not bad, tha video is short and not up to the current standards of Blue Planet etc"
2,"Global Warming, Dead Reefs, Hokey Music & Scuba DooDoo","My title sums it up. I was so disappointed with this video that I felt like I could actually improve on it with some of my own editing! I'd remove 80% of the people scenes, replacing them with home movies of me snorkeling in the Philippines. I'd replace the entire Crosby, Stills and Nash sound track with Jimmy Buffett tunes. I'd throw in a few more dead coral reefs from around the world and get Ben Stein to narrate. I'd throw in a scene where my mask fills up with water and I almost die from a jelly fish sting. Finally, I'd add some special features of me talking about whatever and a nice long 'About Me' feature. I'd still have a crappy video but better!"
2,ho-hum,"Jacques Cousteau, we miss you! This was a bit ordinary considering the topic. This cinematography was fuzzy at times."
2,Not what it seems,"What HD video there is I enjoyed immensely. What I didn't want is to be PREACHED to about the ecology of disappearing reefs - which is a serious problem, but NOT what this film purports to be. And, I didn't care about seeing tax-payer funded university types wasting money endlessly repeating experiments finished by others. They are so obviously desperate to justify their priveleged life style it they try to convince you reef proximity to shore is worthy of months-long studies by numerous funded (and volunteer) biologists and divers."
2,Very disappointed...,"Very disappointed with this DVD, Crosby,Stills & Nash background music was so overpowering that you had trouble hearing the narration most of the DVD. We had to keep turning the volume up and down.My first thought, was this a music video for the CSN song Southern Cross (boat) off on a quest ?!Does have some nice photography, but way to much information on how IMAX creates their films for me !If your looking for something to de-stress with underwater corals and fish, not sure this will do it.But, if you want to see more on the Techical end of underwater photography, this might do it !"
4,Tropical Vacation in a Box,"Beautiful to watch again and again. Special features 'Making of ...' also excellent. A favorite to watch with the kids. Subtracted a star for being less informative than I had hoped and for the constant beating over the head with the environmental stick. For an equally stunning, more informative presentation, highly recommend 'The Blue Planet - Seas of Life' (Parts 1-4) (2002) Attenborough, BBC."
2,I've seen better... Much Better! Not the epic film I was hoping...,"I bought this DVD based on buyers that had bought Baraka thinking they might be similar. There isn't even a comparison! Coral Reef doesn't hold a candle to Baraka. Coral Reef is more like watching a little show on the Discovery Channel or OPB. The underwater shots are great, but nothing epic and the narration is cheesey. The music has no flow to it, jumps around too much and is even a little obnoxious. There are some goof ball sound effects added in the documentary as well. I'm just surprised that people would reccomend this movie in relation to Baraka. They just aren't in the same category, not to mention Baraka is full feature length, and Coral Reef is just 40+ minutes. I give Coral Reef 3 stars because it's good as a documentary and 'Discovery' type show... But it's nothing epic and out of the ordinary."
4,Excellent educational tool,This video was well done and it brings the beauty of nature right into your living room or classroom. I wish it was a bit longer though.
4,educational and inspiring at the same time..,"Liam Neeson narrates a 45 minute documentary on the benefits of coral reefs on the eco-system on the ocean. This film focuses on the Great Barrier Reef (northeast of Australia) and also the islands of Figi and Tahiti, which is east of the Great Barrier Reef.You learn a lot about the interplay between fish and other creatures and their dependence on the reef for shelter, and food. And the reef survives because small eat the bacteria that grows on the reef; otherwise, the algae would suffocate the reef and it would die. So their is a interdependence on the reef and the surrounding aquatic life around it.Stunning photography and filming are also a part of this documentary.* highly recommended *"
4,Great Visual Feast,"Even if you aren't taken with underwater nature shows, this movie will probably grab you. The visuals are stunning, the message is clear, and the sound effects are well placed.I haven't had the chance to watch the HD version yet, but even still the ""plain"" DVD has better resolution and sound quality than most commercially available DVDs.The only thing that could make this disk better is if it were available in 3D!!!"
2,"Some great photography, but little else.","Sure, they capture some great footage, but most of it is above the surface of the water. BBC's Blue Planet series does a much better job below the surface and explains more about the interaction of life on the reefs.This work spends most of its time preaching (to the choir as it were, since those who would choose to watch it are likely stewards of one form or another) about the various factors that have an effect on the underwater. Very over-dramatic and tends to ""dumb it down"" for their perceived audience. Very dissapointing."
5,Coral Reef Adventure,"A magnificent production, visually and aurally. Very educational and inspiring. There was some difficulty in getting the disc to play on some machines, but not on mine (JVC)."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to receive this movie after reading the reviews that I even had it rush-delivered. Disappointing to say the very least. It says in the description that the movie length is 73 minutes. This is not true. When you get the DVD and look at the back cover, you'll see that the movie is 43 minutes, and the ""making of"" is 30 minutes.The music may be Crosby, Stills and Nash, but some of it is not performed by them. The first song played was a reggae version of CS&N.;I thought the movie was going to be all about the coral reefs; that is, all underwater with stunning video images but a lot of it was old people in scuba gear talking.I bought this DVD because after seeing Deep Blue, I was hooked on documentaries about inner space. I'm not happy with my purchase."
5,Spectacular,"This documentary is an excellent introduction to coral reefs and the underwater ecosystems that they inhabit. You will see their resiliency to outside forces as well as how vulnerable they are to those same forces. This DVD is loaded with stunning visuals which are only limited by the equipment you use to view them. Liam Niesen narrates while songs and adapted songs from Crosby Stills and Nash accompany it.It was a great way to see how outside environmental factors affect ecosystems in a tangible manner. Rather than citing lots of meaningless statistics, you get to see what can actually happen when humans abuse the earth instead of living with it responsibly."
3,Coral Reef Adventure,Great pictures in Blu-ray but not what I expected. More of an environmental/global warming infomercial.
2,Not a very descriptive title,"They should have called this "" Chicken-little's global warming and rainforest diatribe, with a little underwater photography""Twice the statement is made that ALL coral reefs will be dead within 30 years. No science is explained that would support that statement. Sorry, No Sale. If you are going to make hyperbolic statements like that in a film, you beter be willing to devote some time to explaining the facts behind the statement.In the end, I was very dissapointed. You expect dazzling visuals in an IMAX film. This was very lacking in visual content and very overboard in political content.Wish I would have rented it instead..."
1,Had to put one star,"Videotest.exe error message is inevitable. Loading video never happens with HD format. Continues til early dawn. Cannot play in HD format even with ATI x1900xtx and pentium extreme 3.4. Huge waste of time and money. DON'T BOTHER. However, normal format is okay and the film is pretty good. NOT FOR HD VIEWING."
1,Real Sucky - Very Discrimatory,"The production company who produced this DVD needs to wake up and start producing HD DVDs for Macintosh users too. The production company needs to be boycotted. The production company has their heads in the sand. Folks, where do you all think the majority of HD videos are edited on. WMVHD only works for windows computers. This is stupid. The production company needs to rethink releasing DVD-HDs. I really rate this release as a no star."
2,Lacks the energy of their later sessions,"""About Time,"" the debut recording from Georgia's country rock duo Stewart and Winfield, is my least favorite effort of their efforts. It may be that I'm coming at this one backwards---that is, I listened to their later work first---and feel this one pales in comparison.There are some very good tracks here, Catatonic and Easter Sunday Blues spring to mind, but the energy of their later sessions is not as apparent here, especially in the acoustic numbers that dominant the first half of the CD.Hence, I don't think this recording will likely draw many converts to the Stewart and Winfield camp, but it should satisfy those who want to own the duo's catalog or who prefer acoustic sets to a more full-fledged sound."
4,Jane's Decision...,"Even though Seth told Jane that she would be coming home, he had to know the truth. Jane was in horrible pain and dying from a terminal disease. Who would want to ""live"" like that? Sure it's nice to try and cheer someone up, but the bottom line is, Jane's body was failing her, it was time to go.I'm sure Seth was there the second she became spirit."
3,Not one of the best,"I have read almost all of the Seth books and find that each has its value. I often reread them, but not so with The Way Toward Health. It has some good information, but in my opinion, it falls short. The book is almost entirely Robert Butts' observations, with little actual material from Seth, and I found myself becoming very annoyed with both his negative, almost complaining, viewpoint. Jane seems to have been a rather unassuming person but her husband seems consumed by his increasing self-importance. I really wanted to like this book, but I did not."
3,Question,"I gave it 3 stars not having read it - sorry, but I have a question. If Jane knew all of this about health, etc. from ALL the information she had received from Seth over all those years, why did she die from an illness? This almost makes it seem hopeless that the rest of us could make it work."
1,"Boring, too much Author, Author,Authour!","I love the Seth Books, but this is not one that will take up space on my book shelf. It is really trash and not worth the money. If you are a Seth fan save your money and do not buy this one. If you must read it buy it second hand at a really, really, reduced price.It was primarly about the illnes of the Author and offered not insite in self health."
3,Usual Seth Book,"The information in the book is good. Seth discusses health issues from the viewpoint of the Absolute (little focus on nutrition & exercise and more on the body/mind interaction.)Like all Seth books, there's too much irrelevant information (I don't really care if the dictation was 20 minuites delayed that day because Jane's husband got caught in a traffic jam on the way to delivering the draft to the printer. Those kinds of details are in the book.) Fortunately, the mundane details are in italic print so it's easy to skip over them. However, sometimes the italic print provides necessary context to understand the Seth material, but oftentimes it does not."
2,Bring Back the 1970's,"Let's bring back the 1970's, when plastic toy bowling sets were actually constructed well, and the balls were actually round, instead of some deformed egg rolling on the ground. ""Egg"" is an exaggeration, but it can symbolically describe how these balls roll on a smooth surface. Does this necessarily mean that the product is inferior to others in the mind of a 6 year old? Probably not, but as a parent, I remember having a set when I was growing up in the 1970's, and the balls were round, and harder plastic, as were the pins. Nowadays, everything is made cheap, and you're left with a product that won't perform as it should. I know, the name of the game is ""fun"", but this set doesn't stand up to what I grew up with. 3/10"
2,The Life and Times of Spock the Pirate,"Spock fans might enjoy ""Black Fire,"" especially those who have always wondered what he might have been like as a 23rd century pirate. I had never wondered that myself, but apparently Sonni Cooper did, because there is not much else going in her novel. The story centers around Spock and Mr. Scott trying to track down the saboteurs of the USS Enterprise. Along the way, Spock tries repeatedly to commit suicide (which somehow sort of makes sense in context) and becomes the most famous space pirate of all time. It reads a little better than it sounds, but only a little."
2,"Hey, Theodore Sturgeon is wrong","Excited by a foreword by Theodore Sturgeon, I read this book. Dulled after it's conclusion, I wanted my money back. The book has all the old characters from the original series, but hardly any of the feel, regardless of what Sturgeon says in the forward.Save your money and watch the reruns on cable."
3,"it is a good book, however, I am very picky about ST writing","Black Fire was published by Pocket Books, my copy says 1983, however it is numbered as #8, therefor, I do not believe that I have a first printing. I do have a local book store here that sells many of the ST out of print books, these books are used, but most are in good condition. I have the complete set of several different series of books. A total of well over 400 books, actually. If anyone needs titles, e-mail me, and I will check my book store for you! ktn29@excite.com"
3,AIS,shows many muscles being stretched. . . but no explanation of technique at all. A little pricey for a homemade video!
4,Good CD,"This cd is worth it for ""Turn the Page"" alone,... If you can find it out there at a reasonable price purchase it TODAY!!"
4,Good album,i've always been a huge El Debarge fan. He has a way with expressing himself not only as a Songwriter but also as a vocalist. this Album his 2nd one is a vast inprovement over his debut. Broken dreams was one of the best cuts on this album. real love was a cool groove as well. turn the page was on point as well. El Debarge channels alot of vibes and subjects matters on this album. i enjoyed the Production and overall feeling on the album.El Debarge was channeling Marvin Gaye quite a bit on this album. EL is a very versatile Underrated Artist.
4,good product,This game pad is a good low cost game pad for PC's. The computer detected it without any problems on multiples machine. No special drivers were required for windows. The game pad works very well for all the games I have tried. The game pad has a lot of buttons so it configured for most games. It does have a short cord and is probably not durable enough for rough kids. For adults this is a great product.
3,Dekcell USB Gamepad,"For so cheap you can't expect much. It is plug and play, no drivers needed. The shoulder buttons momentarily get stuck sometimes and the cord is very short, about 4 ft. at best. It's fine for kids who are likely to break it anyway or for casual use with emulators or what not. The game-pad I received was black instead of the silver pictured here. It's an OK, super cheap game-pad, good for keeping in your laptop bag."
4,Camping Laser Charm,Nice large size writing and good laser job. Can easily read and see the picture from a distance. Link function was nice.
2,This is an ASP not a .NET BOOK,I own 6 or 7 ASP.Net books. The best is Karl Moore Code Book and a near second is Scott Mitchell Data Web Controls. I read every book cover to cover and test ALL SAMPLES. So $50.00 for a book if I can get a trick or two that works is well worth the price. Well this book looks great and the on line demos work great. Just don't expect to be able to use any of sample code in VS.Net. Now if you want to code .Net in notepad this is you book. If you are using anything other than notepad - pass on this book. None of the 12 samples that I tried to bring into a test project would run. All needed one to two hours of rework just to get going. It is in fact faster to just read the text get the idea and fire up a new blank solution and type EVERYTHING. That is now why I buy books. I do not want to figure it out and retype most of the code...VERY DISAPOINTED.
4,Premonitions then -- fruition now...,"Perhaps the first voice decrying the corrosive effects of individualized media delivery on our social fabric. In the decade since its publication, much of what Shane foresaw has come to pass -- with a relentless vengeance. Even though it's now popular to indiscriminately spur this hobby horse in all directions, the cogent vision of the harbinger can be compelling. It's as if Shane wrote the large-print headings and topics, and others followed and attempted to fill-in beneath."
1,Track retains a permanent 'twist',"I bot this based on the first review who gave it a 5 ...BUT GET THIS .....this track came in a big roll of 50 feet......I cut in two sections layed it flat on carpet and it just keeps on curling up...we put dumbells to hold it straight for 4 days , nothing still twists up in a circle like it wants to be back 'rolled up' . totally worthless !! WILL NOT LAY FLAT ....We cant even use ......I cut the track into 5 foot pieces, still twists on its own and will not remain straight even if I try to bend it . USELESS !!And we love our hot wheels . What a let down this product was !!"
1,Rat food???,"Based on a 5 star rating here, I purchased this product (Neogen Corporation 116316 Rat And Mouse Bait Nuggets). Have used it for 15 days and every morning, it is gone. The pack rats seem to love it, but they just keep coming! Don't know if I'm dealing with a huge population, or if I'm just feeding them. Maybe desert rats are just tougher??? I any event, I am NOT happy with this product."
5,One day Mice-Away! Yeah,This poison worked for my house in one day; also the quanity is wonderful. My wonder cat-Sugar died about 4 months ago and its been mouse haven ever since. I tried another poison but it did not work for 3 months. Great Product
3,Used in addition to Sidekick traps,easy to use but slight possibility of pet use? Will also toss them under home which is covered or screened.
3,A book for very beginners,The book provides an outline to very beginners of QFD. It summarizes the objectives and benefits of QFD methodology. Very useful for short presentations or as a brochure. Too short and simple for people who already knows about QFD. Waste of time for experienced practitioners.
4,nice choices,"when used for meditation, some can be a bit too percussion heavy. otherwise, some are a nice change of pace for meditation or the close of a yoga class. lots of choices."
2,Don't Cut Yourself,"Another product I regret buying. It seemed like a great idea at the time, but setting this item up, operating it, and then the breakdown and cleaning is just not worth the effort. Go for the knife and forget this complicated apparatus."
4,"Before the Duke Lacrose Case, there was The Massie Affair","Fascinating, well told account of what happens when race trumps all. Those interviewed are generally very insightful, with the exception of Haunani-Kay Trask, who makes sweeping generalizations that detract from the impartiality. My thoughts keep returning to this injustice three days after I watched it on PBS.If only we weren't doomed to make the same mistakes and could have learned from history, maybe reason would have prevailed over emotion before three more young men's lives were ruined in North Carolina. The parallels are spooky!"
2,Not the greatest,"I was really expecting more. I felt the photos (black and white) were not of a good quality to add anything to the book. Often the book resorted to telling you to ask someone else. Not what I bought the book for. But, it does have some good info. There are better out there."
4,Great size and easy to use. But..........,"I purchased the bowl so that I could pour out its content easy. It meets that goal and with the nice handle its very easy to use.But the one thing that I dont like is the measurment on the inside are hard to read since they are the same color as the inside bowl and its very hare for me to see them. I think they should have been a dark color so you could see the meassuremets easier. It great for mixing batter as it the products stays in this large bowl, as I have mixed flour with most bowls and the flour flys out it. With this large bowl it stays in it."
5,Great product for the kitchen,"Great buy. The size is perfect for mixing large batches of cakes and bread. I'm thinking of buying another one, maybe a different size. Pouring is easy."
3,dissappointed,Gooseberry products have always exceded my expectations and I always look forward to receiving my newsletters and books. I was deflated when I received my book. It was very BLAH!!!
4,Works well for what I use it for,I use this to attatch a linked set of slings to the D-ring on the back of my full body fall protection harness so I can bring tools up tower with me when I climb wind turbines for work. The lock on the gate always stays tight so I never have to worry.
5,Professional quality,"Hold up to heavy use, easy to open and close. Used in equine application they work all winter and don't freeze up."
5,excelente,tal cual como lo describió el vendedor totalmente satisfecho recomiendo a esta tienda muy buena atención excelente y llego rapido.
4,would buy more,Good higher end product. Cheap enough and recommend for all. Wouldn't be to good for key rings. I will buy more when I need more.
5,About the reviews,"Hey, I bought this book and liked it...and I'm a native New Englander. The coverage for Maine is particularly good, or at least I thought so.However, I'm posting this not so much to let y'all know that the guide is good, but to say that this book is in it's third edition, published in 2001. All of the reviews here date from 2000 and before. They apply to the second edition of the book, not the third. So take them with a grain of salt, cuz LP changes it's content alot when they update old editions.Just my two cents."
2,disappointing,"I used LP lots of times before, and some are better than other, some are really really good, but this was the worst one ever: I used it on a road trip from CT to Maine in December 2006: predictable hotels, compact somewhat boring descriptions, and lack of good stories, interesting details, none of the tips you look for as a traveller.. . Could use some passion."
3,Not amazing.,This is an okay book. It's pretty basic in the information it shares. I would not use it to choose a restaurant. We did on one occasion in Vermont... what a debacle. The restaurant was terrible. It is nice to have on hand in the car if you're bored. It does have some interesting bits of information that's fun to read if you're on your way. Over all this book makes me want to say... meh. I'm just not sure if there's anything better out there.
4,Not too shabby...,"I've always bought Let's Go whenever I travel, but they didn't have a New England book, so I had to get this one. The organization is about the same. It doesn't have as much detail as the Let's Go Boston that I also bought, but I suppose it was because this has more content. The writing is a lot more entertaining that LG though. Also, I found the public transportation info really helpful. I plan on going on a New England road trip someday and I'll definitely bring this book with me."
2,Average,"Didn't meet expectations! Too little information, nothing new nor had any hidden gems or nuggets! Very average!! Contrast -- even an average travel blog on the Internet has more interesting and useful stuff these days! The Lonely Planet editors need to go back to the drawing board!!"
5,Aaron Carter,Aaron may be young but he has more talent and shows more potential than most pop singers did at that age or even now. The songs on this are really cute and grow on you extremely fast. I recommend it to anyone who is into recent pop. Aaron's music is more deep than most of the superficial pop but has not yet reached a very deep level seeing as he has only just turned twelve.
5,If I could I'd give it six stars!!!,Without a doubt THE BEST Forgotten Realms material ever written!!! If your a DM you NEED this book!!!
4,Great Forgotten Realms' Role-Playing Resource!!!,This book is a must have for any would-be Dungeon Master or for any player who wants play a priest. Resources like this are a must for anyone who wants to role-play in richly diverse worlds with exceptional background color.
3,Good for now...,"I wish I could give this 5 stars. First off, this was the only retractable RJ45 which is certified to handle gigabit speeds. My main complaint is that the connectors have been finicky with most of the outlets I have used. I really have to jam it into the socket to get the connect to work. Other than that, it's a handy little tool."
1,disappointing and unhelpful...,"...i lugged this around and liked, at first, looking at the pics -- however this book is not comprehensive in the least to the even slightly curious and adventuresome traveler. this is a tourist guide, not a travelling guide. fyi!"
2,pressure washer leaked from the first day,"The first time I used the power washer water was running out of the bottom of the pump. There still was pressure, but wonder how long it will last? Called the authorized repair shop and was told the unit cannot be repaired. In his words, ""it can't be fixed - it is a throwaway."" I figure I didn't spend much for it, so I should not be surprised I am not getting much either."
2,Gun leaks,Bought this PW last spring. Worked fine last summer. This spring the gun leaks all over. New gun $25 plus $8 shipping. Will try another power washer next time!
1,"Not bad, but I had to buy a replacement gun","Not a bad tool for lightweight use. Unfortunately the gun began leaking badly through the trigger mechanism and I had to buy a replacement gun. That was a $25.00 dollar disappointment. A lot of the parts are plastic and evidently not engineered to last.Update: The gun is backordered and currently unavailable. I had to order it twice. First I ordered online, and when that failed to produce the part, I called and had to order it all over again from a different department, only to be told it was unavailable and backordered. One hand does not know what the other is doing in this company. The customer service reps are not the sharpest knives in the drawer. It's been several weeks and I'm still stuck with a leaky handle. I dropped it to one star from three. It's as good as useless without the gun!"
4,"Damaged but Does the Job, Quick Repair Response","I got this to clean a large pool cover (not olympic, but a large in-ground pool, no idea the square footage) and it worked very well aside from a hole in the tubing, which I had to tape up temporarily. Although it is easy to use, the directions could be clearer. Campbell Hausfeld replaced the tubing immediately and were very helpful."
4,Perfect for home use,"True, I read the reviews here first before buying. I've only used it a couple times but it does a fine job. I didn't want something too strong, just good enough to clean my wood deck w/out peeling off the paint. It did a fine job cleaning the sandstone around my pool too. It's not too big, easy to set up, works fine even with low pressure. Time will tell how durable it is."
5,arrived early,Works great and no complaints...a small unit is so easy to usefor something around the house or boat this is perfect.
3,Leaky nozzle after two years,"The compressor runs fine. Pressure comes up quickly. Lightweight nozzle is easy to control. However, after storing for one winter in the garage, the handle leaks a lot of water. Plenty of pressure still comes out the nozzle but the leaks inside the nozzle release a constant flow of water around the trigger and nozzle housing. I dismantled the nozzle, put Teflon tape where possible and reassembled. A slight improvement. But use is still a very wet exercise. I usually wear water shoes and swimsuit (really!).BTW, the compressor and nozzle were drained for winter storage. A necessity here in Maine.Rick"
5,"Great Product, Stands up to the Job!","I bought this pressure washer about 4 months ago and I am thoroughly pleased with the quality, durability, and power this machine has. I wash and detail cars all of the time and I have washed (with this pressure washer) over 100 cars, 3 houses, and the driveway a dozen or two times! I do have to say though, it did start to not want to use full pressure after about five or so minutes after I started it up, though I did find a way to stop that, just don't put on the spray gun end, just turn it on and spray for about 15 seconds without the spray gun attached and then put the end back on and you are ready to go. I don't know why it does that but it does, overall, for $100 it was a tremendous value, glad to have bought it! (Actually I bought it at Wal-Mart for $40 when it was on clearance :) :)"
2,Not as Pictured,"I received this unit a few days ago, and was suprised to find it is not look anything like the unit in the photo. It is much smaller, and does not allow for attaching the accessories to the unit. It is basically a small carry unit - much lower-tech looking than the one in the photo. It also did not have a car kit, or a soaping wand. The basic unit works fine, and Amazon made some adjustments to keep me happy, but don't order this and expect to receive what is in the photo with all the accesssories."
2,Yet another owner that had a pressure washer gun failure.,"A common story: I used this p/w last year for about 5 hours, and then the pressure gun failed. Disassembling the handle reveals that several plastic parts have broken off inside (it's not an O ring problem). I've ordered a replacement gun/hose from the C&H; Web site ($25+$8 shipping); let's hope I actually receive the part.As a side note, a little research on the Internet last year revealed that this is one of the ""disposable $100 consumer models"" that every manufacturer offers to folks like us. Last year, I thought I'd chance it again, only to have it fail mid-task (the driveway has been half dirty all winter). I loathe gas powered equipment, but what I hate the most is standing in the middle of a puddle of water with a half-finished job and a broken gun in my hand (please excuse the metaphor). While I use up the remaining life of this C&H;, I'll find another washer model that doesn't add to the landfill every summer."
4,Cambell Hausfeld Power Washer,"I have used this power washer to wash my vehicle, a porch and a deck. It does a good job. It has a plastic coupling to attach a garden hose, so do not use the machine to drag the garden hose or you could break the coupling."
5,Great for Detailing,"I bought this pressure washer for my mobile detailing business along with a 25 foot extension hose (bought elsewhere) and it works wonderfully. We use it with gravity flow from a tank positioned in a trailer. Like the other guy said, you have to connect the water already running to the pressure washer to get maximum pressure, but it works great! Especially for the price. I had been told everywhere else that I needed a much stronger pressure washer to use gravity flow, but that is not the case. I would recommend this to anybody for washing cars. We are even thinking to buy a second one for a backup (just in case)."
4,4th C-H pressure washer,"Replaced the same 7 yr. old model,the 25 ft. old extension hose fit new model, only complaint is trigger on new wand is very stiff & takes a lot of grip pressure to hold on."
4,Pressure Washer PW1350,"I received this washer without delay. It has performed admirably so far. I used it twice for extended jobs, washing my driveway, and washing the side of the house. The hose connection leaks some, I added a washer and tried to tighten as much as possible without breaking the plastic connector, but it still leaked. Not a major problem."
1,Disappointing customer service,"I bought this power washer to wash my siding in preparation for painting. When it arrived, it was missing the detergent bottle (which is the reason I bought it, for the onboard detergent which some power washers don't have.) I called customer service and waited for 35 minutes on the line, until someone came on. They said they'd send one out to me, and that it would arrive within 5-7 days.It is now eight days, and it hasn't arrived. I called customer service again, and gave up after 30 minutes on hold. I'm thinking of returning this before the bottle arrives. Meanwhile, it's getting hotter and painting will be a nightmare in July. All in all, a very disappointing experience."
3,Mostly doing the job,"I have only used this item once. It worked very well cleaning some stone steps and paved driveway. I just tested it on vinal siding and it seemed to work well on that too. I tried washing my truck with it and it is not powerful enough to use alone to clean a vehicle. I have not used it for the original reason for buying it, which is washing and preparing for painting a metal roof on a travel trailer. For light cleaning, I would recommend it, but for heavy jobs, more pressure is needed."
4,"Great washer, hard to store","I've used other pressure washers before and this one is not particularly easier or harder to use than the next. It came at a great price, which is why I took it. Upon opening the box, it was extremely self-explanatory and I was using it within minutes. My only complaint is that it's quite hard to store compactly. The gun and nozzle do not collapse well, and the tubing does not coil (which is actually a good feature when it comes to using it).Watch out for the thin wire nozzle-head cleaner. I almost lost it in the box.Otherwise, no regrets whasoever."
4,PW1315 review,"The only thing I have found to complain about is the ""Nipple Adapter"" supplied with the unit. It is plastic and broke with the first use. A brass adapter is sold by the company and I would urge customers to purchase one. The unit functions just as I had hoped it would for the use I bought it for. John"
1,Not up to the standard,I tried this pressure washer. The first came damaged and had to return. The second one lasted for 3 car washings. The components are flimsy and do no hold up under normal wear and tear. Mine is going in the garbage can. Save your money and buy a different pressure washer. This one does not meet the quality standards that you would expect at any price.
3,OK but not as advertised,"The pressure washer worked fine. But unlike the product description says, it does not come with a turbo nozzle or car care kit. There also is no built in compartment to hold the cord and lance. The part list in the box also shows a detergent bottle, which also does not really come with. After 20 minutes on the phone with the manufacturer, I was told to contact Amazon and work it out with them.Amazon asked me to return it. I'll order a different one this time."
5,Works without overheating even after using for hours,"The last pressure washer I ordered, made by another manufacturer, burned up after using it continuously for about an hour but I haven't had that problems with this one.It's powerful enough for washing concrete and outdoor tile and for getting loose paint off of the concrete walls but you'll need a very sharp stream to get the paint off.I'm happy with this unit and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.Update February 2012:The machine still works but the gun is now leaking water.It seems to be a common problem.Update March 2012:I replaced the leaking gun with the Powerwasher 80012 Universal Pressure Washer Replacement Gun and Hose and it's back up and running."
2,Not sure yet,The washer worked perfectly for about 30 minutes before it started acting up. It goes on and off then on again. I checked on line and they said it may be air in the system and the FAQ's told of a different way to start up than in the manual. Also it is possible that my faucet pressure is to high. I am going to try again soon on a different faucet that I know has lower pressure. Hopefully it will work then.
2,forget Bruce,This is not what I expected. I thought I was ordering a Moive - what I ended up with is a documentary. It was my fault - I should have made sure what i WAS ORDERING.
5,One of the best songs by Third Eye Blind ever!,It's a great song. I'm on a basketball team for my school and we listen to it before all our games. It gets us psyched for the game. A must-have!
5,A governess and a highwayman....,"This was a delightful read - a young lady is thrilled to be abducted by a highwayman, who is infinitely preferable to her lecherous new employer. The story has many twists, some Robin Hood type elements, some little revenge vignettes and poetic justice. This was Solomon's first novel, I believe, though it has been reissued on kindle. The original Romantic Times review was very positive'A gifted new author with considerable potential debuts this month with an exciting tale of a governess who falls in love with a highwayman.' A fun read, with a quality writing style."
5,REFRESHING AS A SEA BREEZE,"It seems that men who often say they don't wear cologne are drawn to this new scent from Marc Jacobs. And, the women for whom they wear it are delighted.""Marc Jacobs"" the fragrance for men is distinctively masculine, fresh, woodsy.It has a hint of a sea breeze blended with what I take to be a green base.It makes a statement without shouting, it's a suble aroma."
5,Better than the rest!,Growing up I was never much of a cologne guy until I had a girlfriend who pushed some stuff on me. By shear coincidence I came across a bottle of Marc Jacobs only while I was shopping for some other brands. I cannot begin to describe this stuff. Every time I wear it women compliment me and are always dying to know what it is. All the other bottles of cologne have taken a back seat to this one and will most likely continue to do so. This is a must buy for any man who wants to leave a lasting impression on every woman he meets!
3,"Unique Indeed, love it or hate it","I ordered this cologne having heard good things about it from a friend of mine and based off of other reviews from Amazon. I was really quite disappointed when I received it. It's scent is certainly unique, it is not like most other cologne which smells clean and fresh. This cologne has what I take to be a woody, green base to it which sets it up well, but everything else in it is just too much for me to handle. It is not overpowering, but it has a noticeable and somewhat unpleasant spunk which kind of reminds me of butter. Again, some may enjoy this cologne, but make sure you smell it before buying it yourself."
3,"Great scent, but...","I love this scent. It's very light and masculine, making it a perfect daytime perfume. However it fades really quickly... usually within and hour or two of application. I recommend spraying on your clothes rather than skin to get a little longer life out of it."
3,Doesnt Last,"I dont know if these online perfumers are fake, but I dont know because I bought it from an amazon seller."
1,P-ew!,"Well, you win some and lose some. This cologne was recommended but I found it to be a really unattractive fragrance. I never use it. Perhaps I will send it to the fellow who spoke so highly of it.I love nice fragrances, essential oils. This stuff is offensive!"
3,"Smell good, but doesn't amazed me","Smell good, but doesn't amazed me. I expected something even more, but decided to try it."
4,Grizzly G0555X,"This is my first bandsaw. Set up was straight forward, but took a few hours and you definitely need someone to help you lift it up on the stand because it is heavy and metric wrenches. The motor fan guard was dented and rubbed against the fan, but it was easy to pull back into place. I don't know whether it arrived that way or if we caused the dent taking it out of the box. If you plan to move it around buy the optional wheels. It's a very solid piece of equipment and I've used it a lot over the past 4 weeks. I'm happy with the performance, the light, the rip fence and the cabinet where I can store accessories. I used a plastic 4"" to 2.25"" reducer on the dust vent so I could attach a shop vac and I needed to use glue to make it stay in place. Even with the vacuum attached, there is some leakage of fine sawdust from various places which is slightly annoying. I plan on getting the extension so I can resaw something wider that six inch logs."
2,Should have bought a better machine.,"At one time i would only buy wood working equipment made in the USA, since this is hardly an option, I bought this Grizzly band saw. It was a mistake, the fit is finish is not up to a jet and way behind a powermatic. The wort part is a weak trunion, just leaning on the table and it flexes. Blade guard with riser block does not work well. In addition, without the riser block, the wheels were coplaner, with the riser block, they are not even close. I would not recommend this tool. Should have spent the money on a better tool."
1,where is it?,I still have not receaved this were is it please send it to me as soon as possible. I've been waiting a long time
5,a very fun and easy book to read,i never expected to like this book so much. it was a very complete history of the foundry and the people. i would recommend that anyone from Lebanon should read this.
4,Wonderful Analysis,"Langmuir's work is unique and enlightening. He pursues a unique thesis regarding antisemitism which asserts its difference from other types of persecution. Antisemitism arises from rare 'chimerical assertions' peculiar to Jews and possibly a small handful of other groups throughout history. Most importantly, he reveals the strange growth of antisemitism beginning with the rise of Christianity. He is adamant in his assertion that antisemitism was not a necessary by-product of Christianity but was never the less greatly aided by the social and psychological problems Christianity presented, especially in the 11th to 13th centuries. Anyone wishing a greater understanding of antisemitism, its cultural roots, and its manifestation in Nazi Germany should read this book."
5,Love Melissa and Doug Products,You just can't go wrong with a Melissa and Doug product. They last through rough kid play and the kids love them. This puzzle is a favorite of my three years old granddaughter.
5,fun for all kids ages,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son , he can put it together himself,. I find my other boys doing it also they are ages 7 & 10. Great for all ages pieces are larger for smaller hands etc. Great buy....."
3,less pices at this size!,I think it's too large for children. It would be better if it's 48 pices at this size.
4,joyce fender ella ella irby,"first i have to agree with the other reviewers..on her first solo endevor you will hear a combination of classic klymaxx,prince(vanity6),salt n pepa and vocally a bit of Janet/michael jackson.The title track ""Maximum Thrust"" musically sounds like somthing Prince attemped with the NPG many yrs later, late 90's.. The track ""i love you"" could easily be remade into a hit country tune, it has babyface-esque lyrics, not a bad thing. This is definately worth a listen.."
4,good debut,Fenderella is a former member of Klymaxx and this album is produced by Bernadette Cooper of KLymaxx. It's quite funky and actually reminds one of Vanity or Apollonia 6 . It's a gooy buy & good fun with fine melodies and good grooves
3,Not awful; but just doesn't climax like Klymaxx,"The 80's R&B; girl group Klymaxx made some irresistibly catchy songs such as ""Meeting In The Ladies Room"", ""Divas Need Love Too"", and ""The Men All Pause"".This solo work by Klymaxx member Joyce ""Fenderella"" Irby just doesn't work as well. It sounds more like a hodgepodge of items from the Klymaxx reject bin rather than a self-contained creative masterpiece."
3,Wild Woman's Garden,Pretty good little book - some interesting and helpful material. Came with a card to send for free seeds (for plants covered in the book) which I have not yet received. Enjoyable reading.
3,Nice collection,"I love Dore, and this is a nice collection of his illustrations, but I wish it was in Hardback as a coffee table type book."
5,Legend - how i learned to ride,"I am not one to claim heroes in my life. I began to snowboard at the age of 18. Craig Kelly taught me to ride. I have been a disciple of his riding style and philosophy ever since I discovered the purpose of camber radius. This dvd is an important piece of history on the evolution and progression of snowboarding by one of its greatest masters. get it, study it and practice. you won't regret it."
1,Picture Porter,"This product does not live up to its claim or they do not check it out before it leaves the factory, I give it poor rating."
4,Digital Foci review,"I purchased the 80GB Picture Porter Elite, and I love it. I bought it for a Belize vacation, and it was super easy to use. I didn't give it 5 stars because I can't figure out how to use the shortcut icons, however I haven't had a chance to contact customer service. We went with a group of friends on a scuba diving vacation, and I got a lot of comments on what a great device it was. We took a lot of digital photos, both topside and under the water, and at the end of the day, we would download all the photos and then have a slideshow on the picture porter - everyone would crowd around and ooh and aah. We did finally hook up the device to a TV and show a slideshow on the TV, which was cool.I highly recommend this product."
1,Digital Foci PPE didn't cut it,"While the base features and functions read fine in the ad, the quality of the display was a serious disappointment. This device might be fine for sharing pictures of baby Jean with Aunt Ruth, but it's low res display is insufficient for serious photographers or pros. This device will not show the quality for which you paid if you spent more than $500 for your camera body. Sad, all the other features are OK."
4,Fantasy with an erotic twist...,"I agree with the other reviews...let's get all of Sharon Green's older works re-published for a new generation of fans. I foolishly donated my copies of the Jalav series, Diane Sante books, and Terrilean series to my local library years ago. I would love the chance to buy all of these again."
1,Laborious,This was a very laborious book to get through. The plot never really developed. I have read many of Sharon Green's books and this one was just not up to her usually good style.Peggy Bromm
2,Didn't Live Up,"I absolutely love ""The James Bond Lifestyle Seminar,"" but this audiobook fell short. The plot was decent, but nothing better than you'd expect based on the synopsis. The main character is supposed to be 33 years old, yet his voice sounds like an old man. He sounds very unsure of himself. Also, a lot more could have been done with the sound effects. They did not immerse me in the scenes, as another reviewer claimed."
4,"Great book, but has problems","This is a great book, but it could be greatly simplified, I feel, and therefore, be more effective in this age of mindless adults dumbed down by a worthless public education and university system. Also, his political viewpoint, which rejects out of hand the use of God's laws and moral commands when it comes to government, shows that he is over his head when it comes to this topic. He needs to read more in this area. He might start with Gary DeMar's ""The Ruler of the Nations."" Then, read the last section of Calvin's ""Institutes,"" followed by a closer study of biblical texts such as Romans 13, 1 Samuel 8 and the Book of Proverbs."
2,"Nice Try, But...","While I applaud Moreland's attempt to address the dearth of intellectualism in the evangelical movement, the book's rather decided right wing political bias largely discredits the attempt to promote true Christian intellectualism. By addressing the issue of intellectualism Moreland takes a courageous single step in the right direction but by burdening the work with shallow secular politics the overall effect is to push evangelical Christianity two steps back. If you are looking for a more insightful approach to this issue you might try Noll's ""Scandal of the Evangelical Mind"" or any of the works by Richard Foster."
2,May turn on some lights but leave you in the cold,"This is a disturbing book. While I found much of it enlightening with points well-argued, it portrays a cold-hearted Christianity; an army of defenders and apologetics who have little of the ""impractical"" compassion that we need if we are to bring the spirit of Christ into our world. I prefer the kinder, gentler treatment of this subject by authors like Richard Foster, Philip Yancey, Dallas Willard, who I think better understand the integration of reason and compassion in a life of faith."
2,"Not a very good book, IMO","It must be class notes from a class he taught; it was far too muddled to be a stand alone text. There also times where I felt he was encouraging us that we all must think, but we are all to come to the same conclusion."
4,Food for thought,"I found the book very challenging with regards to understanding the role of the intellect which honours God.But, found it refreshing that prior to reading ""Love your God with all your mind"" my thoughts and views on 'the church's' mentality regarding the intellect for spiritual growth is vital. This validated a lot of my own personal views.I particularly found the teaching on skepticism, scientism, moral relativism very encouraging and I plan to grasp a better understanding of these tools.Also, the controversial views presented at the end of the book concerning church leadership structure (ie: senior pastor) were very interesting as well as a further validation of my own personal views."
4,Good Introducion to Christian Thinking,"Moreland's thesis is that Evangelicals do not think, but that truly loving God requires us to use our heads as well as our hearts. He introduces the reader to some logic and makes points about cultural interaction. Overall a good introduction for Christian thinking. The writing is okay, not great, but good enough.BTW - I find it odd when reviewers criticize a work as being poorly written, intellectually shoddy and full of caricatures when their reviews are...well...poorly written, intellectually shoddy and full of caricatures. Moreland's tone is, frankly, much more irenic."
3,Honest but Slow,"While a required read and not my genre, there were definitely some interesting chapters, but others could be skipped entirely."
5,A challenge to think....,"So many books are written on how to BE a Christian, but few encourage and give us the tools to THINK like one. This is a must-read for anyone serious about deepening their understanding of God's desire for us to be part of His Kingdom leaders on earth, representing Him and fulfilling our stewardship of the incredible intellectual potential we've been given."
5,Excellent read,"Moreland is an excellent teacher. This book explains in a readable way, the need for the Christian to develope a reasoned mind in loving God--moving beyond a mere faith to a faith that involved both reason and faith."
4,Provocative call for believers to pursue an intellectual life,"This book was recommended by Michael Patton's The Theology Program, and I bought it a couple of years ago before picking it up this summer. I put it on my students' book report list last year and it will definitely be there again this academic year. Moreland makes a solid case for why Christians should recover an intellectual life, which has largely been ceded to the secular world, and offers some provocative suggestions for how to get there. Highly recommended."
3,"good product, poor packaging","I had to read the book twice. The first time my irritation kept getting in the way. Often I would agree with a statement only to be irritated by the ""support"". For example, the statement he makes on page 90 that our culture's ""primary agenda is to be amused and entertained"" is well taken. But his supporting details are in a paragraph that makes sweeping (and arguably inaccurate) statements about the origin and meaning of the words ""holiday"" and ""vacation"". Rather than being an insightful support to his statement, it seems to be gratuitous rhetoric.After some time the dust of my irritation settled and I was able to think calmly about his main ideas. All he really wants to do is to encourage the Christian community to value intellectual excellence. I applaud his initiative in doing this. In spite of my critisicms (of which there are many) I came away from the book having learned a lot. I would sum up his message as ""Think! Brother, think!"". And that's just what I did!"
5,RECOVERING PONY TAIL ADDICT,"I AM A RECOVERING PONT TAIL WEARING ADDICT. Before reading this informative book I would wear my hair in a ponytail every day. Mrs. Moss has taught me how to have bouncy, free-flowing hairstyles all of the time. Thank you sharing this information with the world. I am going to purchase several copies for my friends for Christmas presents."
5,"MOSS EQUIPS THE BLACK WOMAN TO HAVE HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL HAIR",I just finished reading this very insightful hair care masterpiece. It was very easy to read. Almost like having a private conversation with Mrs. Moss as she helps me to make sure my hair is as healthy and beautiful as it can be. Enjoyed tremendously the question and answer section at the end. Thanks to Mrs. Moss I am now more capable of taking care of my hair. I can't wait until the next one.
5,powerful book,"This book has change my whole out look on hair. I love the manner in which Mrs Moss addresses the good hair bad hair theory. I was always told that I had bad hair. I thank the author for showing me that this is wrong and how I felt. This book gives valuaable information that is easy to apply and is not time consuming. The techniques are not highly concentrating, and are very easy to understand. The writing style of the author is light and carefree. Reading this book was a pleasurable experience. I am usually very turned off by books that have a complicated writing style. My 10 year old daughter read this book and understood every thing the author had to say. She kept telling me that makes sence Mom. Now that's saying something!!!!!"
3,Helpful suggestions,"This book was a helpful guide to haircare. The author includes valuable information of what ingredients to look for in shampoo and conditioner, and suggestions for maintaining hair. For those who have no clue when it comes to their hair this would be a good purchase. Not only does Ms. Moss tell you what to do with your hair, but she explains why. This is also a good book to purchase to double check your hair maintenace routine."
1,Not Good Enough,"I purchased this book after the birth of my second child to keep the hair I grew during my pregnancy. It was way too general. I need product reccomendations that are specific. Also, since I have purchased this book (almost 3 years ago) I have read Cathy Howse Ultra Black Hair Growth system, reccomendations and products. They have produced much better results ( esp. air-drying then curling, getting rid of protein in moisturizer, deep conditioning and moisturizing often often...). Don't get me wrong as there is some useful info. such as reduce heat on the hair which is good and you will get good results as far as your hair looking good. But I not only want good looking hair. I also want healthier, longer, growing hair and this was not enough information.Now, I am not wasting my money trying every product that comes out. Healthy hair ""tips"" is an fitting title. But if you need more try Cathy's book."
1,A waste of your money,"The reason I love Amazon.com so much is because I love books even more. I have never read a book that I thought was a waste of a good tree-until this book! This was a horrible book, poorly written and a complete waste of both my money and time. For a GREAT book about creating healthy Black hair, read the following book. Ultra Black Hair Growth II: Another six Inches one year from now. Author: Cathy Howse.After you read Ultra Black Hair Growth II, you too will share my opnion of this book (I bought them at the same time)"
4,This is the book for every black woman whose on the go.,This books relates to all black woman. Whetner you are young or old. If you want your hair to look like a million bucks you need to purchase this book! If you need tips on how to care for your hair I suggest you read this book.
1,If you know NOTHING about haircare--this book is for YOU,"Based on the reviews I read online, I anxiously awaited the arrival of my new haircare ""bible"". I was sorely dissapointed when the book arrived -- filled with the obvious. There was no depth and nothing that I didn't already know. I am not a haircare professional and consider myself only fairly knowledgeable on the subject. Mama always said if you can't say anything nice about something, don't say anything at all. Sorry Mama, I just had to tell folks that this book is VERY basic."
2,Disappointed reader,"I was disappointed when I read this book. It was an easy read and the author really made you feel like you and her were long time friends; however, after reading it I didn't feel like I had really learned anything new. She gave some good information on the structure of our hair, but other than that I felt not much else was learned. I feel that there could have been more in-depth information on different hair styles; maintenance for those particular styles; more information on different textures of hair and their unique problems; and, definitely more pictures on hair styles. The other thing I found a little difficult was that the pictures were in black and white--it was somewhat difficult to see the detail of the styles she did have in the book."
2,Frustated Exam Taker,"I purchased this book because I have limited funds to a workshop -- thought I would do better on the test -- third timed I tried to pass this LMFT test -- raised the score a little but not high enough. I have almost given up on getting this license -- test is made for people just out of school who know the text book answers -- I have been in the counseling field for over 15 years and logic in the field just does not work with this test. Unfortunately the test is written to trick people -- two close correct responses -- It does not test your knowledge, but how lucky you are...... Not sure if I will try a 4th time....."
4,exotic and eerie,"Soundtracks have always been integral to my enjoyment of the film, and this has been no exception. Although the instrumental pieces can be somewhat repetitive, they reflect the mood of the movie accurately. Also, the Vietnamese tracks added to its exotic setting (Little Saigon, Sydney). You can really become immersed in that culture.The artists that aren't listed with their songs on the Amazon track list:1. Sarah Blasko3. Hoodoo Gurus5. Mylinh Dinh7. Bic Runga9. The Sacred Heart School, Cabramatta11. The Enterprise Band feat. Hoang SonTracks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 13 are instrumentals by Nathan Larson.""Flame Trees,"" originally by Cold Chisel, is a melancholy song that appears twice in the movie. First, it is sung by a children's choir (which seemed to be too sad and serious a song to be sung by children, in my opinion!). And then Sarah Blasko's version appears at the end. Quite the anthem of lost souls."
5,This is a great piece of equipment for the beginner.,"I have just begun using an SLR camera. This was the right choice. It is simple to handle and does not have any confusing features. And best of all, it doesnt break. All around i think this camera was a good buy."
2,5 stars Really?,"5 stars would suggest to me that there is nothing in this book that could be improved, it's perfect. All I take from these reviews after purchasing this book is that these reviewers must work for the publishers.This book is typical of a number of the genre, nice reproductions of the original plates but little in anything that would give an insight in to the building's layouts, construction and design inspiration. If this book had been reproduced at the same scale as the original then it would make a great coffee table book.I keep buying these books in the hope I'll find another ""Classic Modern Homes of the Thirties."" Here is a book the explains the houses, their layouts and the purpose behind their design. The optimist in me keeps buying these books in the hope of finding something similar. This book isn't it."
4,Weird when sitting down,"I don't know if it's because of my beer belly, but when I sit down the tie doesn't have enough room to slide up or down to lay flat against me freely. I have to pull the tie down to straighten it while sitting. Other than that it's great."
4,nice but overpriced,Tiealign works a treat as the British say. It's too bad the company is so xenophobic they won't ship overseas.
3,Tiealign Tie Stay,I previously used similarly designed product made of cloth. This works as well but I'll be interested to see how durable these thin plastic stays actually are.
4,This is a great CD!...,I went to there concert where they opened for DHC and they put on a great show... and this cd is great!... If you like DHC or any other girl SKA bands you will love this!.. great buy!
5,Great toy for any kid!,"I don't know who has more fun with this puppet... my daughter or my husband. We don't even watch the videos (we aren't too keen on TV for babies) but the puppets and other Baby Einstein toys are just great! Our girl, 7 months old, gets a kick out of seeing this doggy bark and slurp her face. You can move your thumb back and forth to wag his tounge, too. My husbands hands are a little big for this puppet but we have the dragon, too, and that one is roomier. This is such a fun toy and so interactive!"
3,BAD,"TOY IS GOOD, BUT THE SELLER LISTED THE TOY FOR $23.00 AND WAS BILLED $37.00 FOR IT. SO OVERALL MY KIDS ARE HAPPY WITH THE TOY, BUT I AM VERY UNSTATISFIED WITH THE TRANSACTION. AMZON SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS TYPE OF SCAMS"
1,Not a quality item...,"Playstation 3 Air CoolerStraight out of the box this item did not want to fit snugly on the back of my PS3. I had to gingerly place it on and just hope it didn't fall off. It did seem to help cool the console a little. Unfortunately, after 5 hours of use, it stopped working. I am not pleased with this product and I would not recommend it. I am returning it to Amazon."
2,WOULD NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS.,"I bought this for a total price of 18.00 new. When I got it I went to put it on my new 80gb system that came out in June,08. It went on with out a problem and the wires hooked back up but when the optical cable went to be hooked up it didn't wont to plug in. So I took the cooler of and plugged the optical cable in and then put the cooler back on. The cooler seemed to blow out less air than the PS3 fans after a hour or two. Plus the cooler vibrates the PS3 and no vibration is good for any computer based gaming machine. I took it off and put it back in the box. It didn't do anything for me,I just put a little desk top fan that you plug in and it seems to keep the PS3 cooler than the PS3 cooler did. The new PS3 don't have a overheating problem and mine is kept in the open but the cooler any electronic runs the better."
2,compatibility of products,"the fans were weaker than i expected. it did not fit my ps3. it was my fault, the ps3 model i have is not compatible with the cooling fan i bought."
4,...,It's a little noisy but it helps in the long run. I leave my system on for a few days and it doesn't overheat.
1,Will not work with the newer playstation 3's,"As to how this thing works I have no opinion, this just to warn the consumer that if you own a newer play station 3 slim forget using this product it will fit at all!!!!!!."
3,Good item,"The cooler work good, it helps to remove quickly the hot air inside the PS3, besides when the console is put out the internal fans are put out and the cooler helps to chill them quickly. But if the fans of the coolers had more potency, it would be a better product."
3,inter cooler,i can see it a good job for my ps3. But over heats but cool down console quicker and it got no damage to my ps3 which that is good... But sony needs to make the console with buildin a cooler withit. so that way the console can run better and i hope the nextgen sony playstation is not so expend of... plz let the console be a good price this good time. so that way it can be worth it....
4,"good quality, typical of M&D","This puzzle is exactly what you would expect from Melissa & Doug. Solid pieces, decent graphic. My 2-1/2 year old likes it a lot. The only con: while the wood backing makes a nice building area -- there is no handy way to store pieces. We have them in a plastic baggie - and the wooden backing has found some shelf where it will surely get dusty."
1,SNL (...),This collection is an insult to Chris Rock. SNL has succeeded in even making the greatest comedian of our time look bad. Rent this first to see how bad it is before you waste your money as well as your time. Get his concert and HBO shows. This is what happens when you put a comedian from the wild in a SNL cage.... he dies. Thank God he was able to be reborn on HBO. It's just not funny. Sorry.
3,Not too bad,"This is a pretty funny DVD full of some of Chris Rock's best skits on SNL. But, beware, some of the recurring skits aren't featured at their best on this disc. The Nat X skit was the one from when he hosted the show, and definitely not as good as the ones when he was a cast member."
1,"Humdrum Platitudes - if this book helps you, you need help.","A very thin book with not much to say. I breezed though it in 15 minutes as I have read or heard everything before - only much compellingly elsewhere.For starters, wouldn't you think a book on visual aids would be printed in color?Many references to ""the Japanese are smarter than Americans"" school-of-thought which was in vogue in the late 80's.My hope was that this book would discuss specific guidlines on what makes a visual aid effective, but boy was I wrong; only a fleeting chapter on some cliche charts that every factory in the country has been using for 20 years or more, such as the ""192 days without an accident"" you see at every construction site."
5,Comment from the Illustrator,"I'm so pleased with the way my illustrations complement this lovely journal. I hope anyone who follows the pictorial story of this young girl and her unicorn will enjoy the journey! Feel free to share your thoughts with me, here or at <julieberson@mediaone.net>."
4,cool!,This is a really cool book I think anyone who loves fantasy wold think this book is a must have!
4,Good value,"I bought this card to use in a Kodak camera, but for some reason the camera could not read the card, so I put it in my cell phone (Nokia 6265) and it works just fine. I also plugged it into my card reader and connected it to my PC. Perfect."
4,Problems with mini adapter.,"Everything work fine, but I have some issues with the adapter. I can't use the mini sd card adapter with a card reader from the same manufacturer."
2,broken card,the card did not work we are in process of returning the card and so far they seem resonable to work with.
1,"If your looking for a mobile phone card, this isn't it","I bought this card for my Nokia 6133(advised by t-mobile to get it online)I was very upset to find it doesn't fit my phone. The seller, EEk technology are cheats who charged me $20 for the card + shipping, then I had to pay to return it and was charged a 20% restocking fee that is unexplainable. Shipping was only $2, so why was I charged $8? How are you supposed to know the card works if you don't open the package? Don't ever buy anything from them unless your 100% sure it's the right item. EEk's policy on return is unfair and just plain terrible. Their shipping is high, and if it's open your better off selling it yourself, thats what I'll do next time."
5,Works Perfectly!,"I would of spent at least $100 + more for this if I bought at Best Buy, Circuit City, etc. And, it's a brand I heard of before."
5,Worth it...,I purchased this product for my phone and its been working just fine. I strongly suggest purchsing sandisk digital cards...
3,Sometimes does not work with my Treo 750,"The space is not read correctly by my Treo 750. It is registerd only about 1.8 GB instead of closer to 2.0 GB as it is said on the description of the product.Also, I have to restart my Treo 750 sometimes in order to be able to use the card.So my recommendation to those who are considering to purchase this 2.0 GB card is that make sure you know what you are doing before you take the action, otherwise do not be mad when you have to experience the same problem that I am experiencing with the card. Good luck."
1,The product failed after one week,"the failed product was returned on Dec. 26th, but the company has not yet sent me the replacement"
1,Poor customer service,I ordered the miniSD card and didn't realize I needed a microSD card until I got the package. I emailed the company the same day I got it but they never responded. I wanted to exchange the item for a microSD card.... but they never responded.
5,It works,"SD cards are kind of like batteries now. They just work. What else is there to say about them?How about: ""I love the contrast of the black finish and white lettering on this card"".Or: ""What a thrill to slide the micro SD card into the large SD card, and then the large SD card into the SD card reader! It brings back fond memories of playing with Russian nesting dolls as a child."""
1,It did not work,I have a pocket pc 6700 and was excited when I finally got my mini sd card. Short lived for my device and another pocket pc that I put it in would not work. Sent an e-mail to get an exchange and hopefully this was only a defective one. I will put in another review when this transaction is done and let you know how they took care of it. Hopefully I can give a good review then.
4,Eventually arrived,The product was received and was as described. I would not call the shipping quick.
4,Works on my Nokia N73,"I bought this memory for my Nokia N73, not knowing it is compatibl, but it did. The memory has pretty good speed when copying files."
2,Read his memoirs instead,"I purchased this book several years ago after reading Lord Berners' two autobiographical volumes, ""First Childhood"" and ""A Distant Prospect."" Both of these books offered excellent insight into the character of Lord Berners and on a broader level into the social milieu -- late Victorian England -- that he grew up in.While an excellent memoirist, Lord Berners falls flat in the short story arena. I don't have a sense of how his stories were received during his lifetime, but feel that regardless they have not aged well. They seem strangely heavy handed and overwrought for someone who wrote so deftly when describing his own life. I didn't end up reading the entire book, so perhaps I gave up to soon."
1,Broke in a week,"I used it for no more than an hour a night for a week. All of the sudden, when I plugged it in, the computer doesn't sense it at all. This is true on all USB ports, after various reboots and trouble shooting.This thing is almost certainly toxic and difficult to recycle."
1,PC joystick,This the 2nd joystick I got. The first one did not work. The second one also did not work and the driver disc was broken. If you have win 7 64 bit OS you may have problems. Buy a joystick with 64 bit driver or a brand name.
3,Good for rough use,I bought this piece two months back and found it to be robust and best suited for rough users. Some times the buttons at the back need some extra pressing but its ok when you get adjusted.The vibration feature isn't that great in this game pad if you are planing to have a real experience with your rumble pad then you should probably go in for a specialized one.The analog sticks are really in tact and it has been doing well. The game pad is quite comfortable when held and this one has quite a long wire so that yu can sit back and play. I would give it three stars just because it isn't that great a game pad but for its price may be you can add an extra star.
4,Good cheap gamepad,"This is a great item for what you're paying. It's essentially a cheap, generic gamepad put into the casing of a dual-shock controller. The d-pad is four separate buttons, which is pretty annoying, but you get used to it, and I actually find it preferable vs. the d-pads on most PC game controllers. Also, the l3 and r3 buttons(when you push down on the analog sticks and they make a clicking sound) are a little too sensitive, but I can't think of a single game that uses them, or a single good use for them, so it's all good. It comes with no drivers or anything, so you can't do anything crazy like map the buttons to keys or set turbo buttons or anything. It plugs and plays on pretty much any system, the last reviewer was running a G5 iMac, and I'm using a PC with Kubuntu 7.04, so if your computer has at least one USB port, the product will more than likely work. There's room for improvement, but for ten dollars I doubt you could do any better."
3,"Good cheap gamepad, but eventually broke","For $10 this gamepad was the right price, just plug it into the nearest USB port and it worked great. Unfortunately it isn't very durable and after a few months one of the small joysticks broke, essentially rendering it useless. I would purchase it again but we're getting a PS2 system so we won't need it. Just a warning for those of you considering a purchase, it is cheap plastic and you get what you pay for. We got great use out of it though."
2,Too Fragile.,"I have broken 2 of these things in normal game play (GTA: Vice City). On the first, the cord just pulled out of the back. It started out loose and the connection would come and go and then eventually it just pulled out. Took about 3 months.So i ordered another one because they are so cheap. It lasted about 2 months playing Jets n Guns. The left analog stick stopped returning to center.Ultimately they are cheap as hell so I'd consider it basically a disposable Joypad."
3,It's Cheap,"The price is quite possibly the best thing about this gamepad. Why are they so expensive, anyway?The PS1-style is pretty cool, though I'm a Nintendude myself. The fact that you can tell it's some kind of cheap plastic when you're using it is kind of a downer, but that's expected with the price.It did break fairly quickly on me (I'm gonna say after about 6 or 7 months), but once again, look at the price.This is probably the millionth time I've said this, so I'll say it again for good measure: The best thing about this is the price."
2,bad controller.,this controller lasted for about a year until the left analog stick started to make crunching sounds and then there was no spring to re center the analog!!and the cord severed itself at the controller's entrance. do not buy unless you only want it to last a year at best!!
2,Takes FOREVER to boil water,"I use this mainly as a stockpot, but it takes forever for even 3 quarts of water to start simmering (my cheap 5 quart Tools Of The Trade stockpot boiled water at a third of the time). I have the 2 quart Chef's Pan which boils water fine."
1,Not great,Not sure why this is getting such great reviews. The product is cheap with a tiny handle and think base.
2,Good but outdated,This was a good book before the digital age. It mostly concerns itself with filing bits and pieces of information. Today where most info is accessible in digital format. Or scanner ready to be stored as such. The information in this book is out of date.
1,Complicated,This system is way too complex and takes far too much work for me. To set up and learn to use this system would take hours for me. And I am a visual person; out of sight out of mind. I was looking for helpful suggestions and really didn't find anything that was beneficial. I am disappointed in this book.
1,A Cluttered Complicated Book,"The methods described in this book will complicate your life, not make it easier. The instructions are supposed to help, instead they add more paper work, requiring you to make a ""paperdex"" file index listing every file put away. Perhaps if the book were updated to reflect the usefulness of computers it would be more helpful. There is a lot of fluff here as well, like an entire chapter to help you figure out what type of person you are. I sent my copy back."
5,It Really Works!,"I had at least 20 boxes of papers and clutter filling my office closet and making the floor into a minefield. Now I'm down to 5 boxes and have no fears that I won't be able to finish them. After fighting with filing for 30+ years, I found the answer in Pat Dorff's book.Some people may find the book daunting to read - but if you try the system, step by step, you'll come to see how simplifying it really is. I had to do some adaptation because of the huge amount of unfiled papers I had, but that wasn't difficult, either. What I like best about this system are the way you can see it working and, because of this, the confidence it gives you to keep going. I used to be afraid to open the boxes. Now I approach them with energy!"
3,A book from the last century,"I've been reading this book. I'm still undecided about using the author's system for my paperwork at home. The system has some attractive aspects, but I have big doubts.First, I am dubious about labeling file folders only with code numbers. I don't relate well to ""M101"" and would rather the label says what's in the file, such as ""College Transcripts.""But mostly the book seems outdated in many respects. It was written in the 20th century before we had PCs in our homes. It instructs us to write entries on the paperdex in pencil, so we won't have a big mess if we delete or change something. And it assumes we will be typing labels. These and similar passages aren't just quaint - they are distracting. I wonder if this is really a good system in the computer age, or if there's a better alternative for me. Will putting the Paperdex in an Excel file, and adding descriptive words to the cryptic code numbered folder labels, be enough?"
3,Just do it!,"Written in 1986 ""File... Don't Pile"" predates the wide-spread use of home/office computers for record keeping and deals only with circa 1990 paper data (that's why I gave it 3 stars.) The totally paperless work place has not arrived at my office and I still must deal with a large amount of personal and business communications/forms. The ""File... Don't Pile"" system is great for managing these documents. Combine ""File... Don't Pile"" method with a spreadsheet (I use Excel) version of the ""Paperdex"" and it becomes awesome. Had it been updated for the digital office I would have given it 4 stars. Pat Dorff's book is an easy read and well worth your time."
1,Old-fashioned with nothing about computers,"This is an old book. The system is complex. It is geared mostly to filing ""old"" paper ie magazine clippings etc. I hardly do this anymore since current information can be done with an internet search pronto when you have a specific need. The problem of bills, schedules, receipts, coupons, catalogs etc. isn't handled in as much detail as the ""old paper"" stuff. I was disappointed in the book.The basic pearl of all these organizing books is ""GET RID OF AS MUCH STUFF AS YOU CAN""."
2,Good methodology yet somewhat outdated,"The book offers a sound methodology for indexing and filing paper documents. But I suppose it was written prior to the invention of the PC, so it lacks any reference to technology tools."
4,"Worthwile, if a bit flawed","The book gives a solid catalog of logic errors with examples to illustrate each type. The author is focused on factual truth, sometimes at the cost of real-world meaning. Some of the fallacies described were not new to me, but it was still useful to see them explicitly laid out.Overall it's a quick and worthwhile read, and entertaining--especially if you enjoy a sarcastic wit."
4,Useful chapter on Empty Words/Academia,"Sitting in academic lectures and reading academia can be tiring, boring and just plain difficult. I am a teacher, and I thought hard about my profession as I read this book. Academic language can be pretty tough to understand, especially when it comes to education texts. It gets worse if you have to listen to someone lecture AT you in academese/edujargon and he/she is reaping a huge fee for it.Jamie Whyte makes it clear WHY this is boring. The words are empty--but the words just cant be simplified; it has to sound important to be important. Here is an example from page 67 of the book:""Benchmarked against best-in-class peers, intellectual capital leverage reveals signifiant upward potential moving forward.""Whyte states: ""This is pathetic but popular. And, you can sympathize. Who would feel comfortable charging $250,000 for:""Companies like yours make better use of their employees' knowledge"""
3,Good primer on logic and rational thinking,"The author is a lecturer on philosophy at Cambridge University, so it stands to reason that he'd write about what he knows best: logic. He does thoroughly explain logical fallacies such as begging the question; equivocation; and arguments from authority. The book is readable and funny, however, Whyte adopts a tone of sarcasm and arrogance that turns off many readers."
4,Crimes against Logic Review,"This book seems to have been written by a very cynical man. While his points are valid, most of them are common sense. If you have enough brains to want to know more about logic, you probably already know all the points he is going to make. The people most likely to need this book are probably the ones who don't know enough to purchase it. With the holidays just around the corner, perhaps you all know someone who could use this book. Would make a great gift!"
2,Not really what I was looking for--pretty mediocre.,"This was not quite what I was looking for, although some decent points were made. I did feel like I wanted my money back, even though it was worth skimming through. Overall, I was bored with the tired anecdotes where the author tried to explain logic by shooting down his own pet peeves. Sure, there were some good points here, but if you're looking for a solid, comprehensive summary of logic, this is not that book. Sophomoric."
1,Crime against book-readers,"I bought this book because the title sounded interesting, as did the blurb. However, this book is not very well written and treats an interesting topic in a very petty way. I love books and rarely loan them to others to read. However, I left this one in the hair salon and didn't bother to go back for it. 'nough said."
2,Impossible Read,"I bought this book thinking it would be along the lines of Freakonomics/Blink/Tipping Point etc., based on Amazon's recommendation. Unfortunately it was drastically different: difficult to follow and not at all entertaining. Big disappointment."
3,Interesting but flawed,"This book was a short read and interesting and I won't say it presented a lot of new material, but there were a few arguments I hadn't heard before. The flaw is, in several chapters the author commits high crimes against logic himself in obsessing over the exact meanings of words and then drawing false conclusions from these parsings. As if our shared language was precise enough that every phrase and word could be dissected and meaning extracted.This to me indicates the author hasn't quite achieved the mastery of logic he seems to think he has.Still I think this would be a good read for a teenager or someone needing an introduction to questioning authority, and thus it earns 3 stars."
3,"Somewhat Witty, Perceptive and Shallow","I suppose I am writing a short opinion because it was good enough to warrant a reaction. From the cover you would think it would have been a hilarious decimation of humans holding on to their inconsistencies. In fact, it wasn't. I appreciated the reminders of the logical inconsistencies most of us engage in as things we ought to try and avoid. But his own premises were often far too shallow, not necessarily bad for a short book aimed at entertaining as well as educating, but shallow in a simplistic sense. The book does well in setting up straw man arguments without acknowledgment of premises as likely being more complex. However, many of the premises are truly simple and warrant the taunts promised on the book cover, even if the taunts are not really all that scathing.Knowledge and truth are tough stuff to understand deeply. Don't expect insight here. But some pointers in everyday rational missteps might be found."
2,"Was hopeful, but was let down...","I was hoping that this was going to be a logical, yet entertaining book. It ended up being more about the author ranting against childhood fallacies rather then actual logic. I found that he broke his own rules of logic in explaining how others did. Very disapointed, I should have bought the selfish gene instead."
2,Bad Logic,"I was expecting a book about logic and argumentation, but unfortunately, I found a book filled with contempt for the reader. The author is unfailingly dismissive of the reader and of contemporary sensibilities throughout and fails to recognize his own biases in his arguments.I can not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Book is not actually about logic,"As a commentary on the failures of British politics, organized religion, and sales reps, this book is rather predictable, but no worse than the next book on the shelf. As a textbook in logical thinking, it's just pathetic. The author insufficiently explains the types of logical fallacies he's attempting to describe, because he becomes too involved in his examples. Sooner or later, every example becomes another rant about British politics, organized religion, or sales reps. Often in his attempt to discredit one of those three groups, he employs many logical fallacies, and not just he ones he conveniently left out of the book.If you want to learn to argue logically, or teach others to do so, you should find another book, or use this one to illustrate what NOT to do. If you really hate British politics, organized religion, or sales reps, this book might give you a few new arguments to use, but don't expect them to be logical."
1,Not Impressed,"The book tended towards rants against organized religion, and the author's persistent use of emotionally charged verbiage revealed quite a negative bias. It is unfortunate as there are a plethora of examples the author could have used to make his points, which in a few cases were worthy of note. Overall not worth the effort or the price."
2,For Beginners,"I dont understand the hype behind this book. High school students would find it very useful, for sure. College students, sensible and mature adults? Newspaper reading. Working professionals, advanced degree holders? Waste of money. If you can comprehend newspaper editorials without much difficulty, then you wont miss this book.I think the writer was confused about who his target audience is. If no one but beginners benefit from this book, then it should have been marketed that way. That being said, this can be a good gift for teenagers. I strongly believe in using logic and reason wherever possible, so I will definitely gift it to my younger cousins.Most adults can safely ignore this book."
2,Poorly written,"I am not sure how this book managed to get a 4 stars average rating. Its poorly written, the author comes across as very arrogant and what he writes about is the most basic of stuff. Its not really worth reading."
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a yawn","This is a quick read. I read it on a flight to Cleveland. The book begins with wit, humor, and searing critiques of serial logical offenders. I particularly enjoyed how Mr. Whyte exposed the logical flaws in Pascal's wager, and people's right to their opinions.Unfortunately, Mr. Whyte ends the book with a yawn. He is bothered by the religious faithful, and by the end of the book you'll probably get tired of the author's frustration with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc."
2,Stating the Obvious,"Not very enlightening. Boring. The author identifies common colloquial phrases and breaks down the logical reason why they are not to be taken literally. I Think most people who engage in conversation or listen to speeches know that already. If your level of interpretation is zero, then this book may interest you."
3,Of Logic and Crimes,"I was excited to read this book but found the writing choppy and not very engaging and the content little more than a few basic concepts rehashed and stretched out to fill a medium size book. The subtitle, ""Exposing the Bogus Arguments"", is a red herring. While some are provocative and a few even profound, most of the examples used by Jamie Whyte are pat not to say generic, and quite a bit patronizing at times given that the book's intended audience is surely above high school level.Speaking of crimes against thinking, the way I see it, ""FROM LOWBROW TO NOBROW"" (2006) did a much better job of ripping to shreds crimes committed by sloppy thinkers and cultural conservatives--this time against popular culture. His book is entertaining, fast paced, and perhaps most important executed with impeccable logic! Highly recommended."
2,Can't Recommend,"I bought this book as a potential learning aid for my work group. While all my staff works in technical areas, I hoped that this book might help structure their thinking. We work with the public, regulators, and others who often have a specialized view. Recognizing bogus arguments isn't the problem; the ability to explain the bogus-nature of these crimes against logic is not a skill many non-philosophers possess. The book met my expectation, with respect to advancing this ability. HOWEVER, Mr. Whyte chose Christianity and its deeply held moral beliefs as the basis for a plurality of examples. Mr. Whyte's book deserves a sub-title - The Case Against Christ, opposite of Lee Strobel's bookThe Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus. The rant against faith became tired and sad."
4,good but a little too pompous,"If you ever meet this author and get a chance to sit down for a conversation...turn and run in the other direction. He will take your every word and use it against you, making semantic arguments to make you look foolish. Or at least that's the impression I got from reading this book. I've used this as a supplementary text in argumentative writing courses I teach. It's nice to take a chapter at a time as a guide to avoiding logical fallacies, but it's maybe too much to just sit and read. Unless your a pompous jerk who enjoys feeling superior all the time. I only enjoy it sometimes."
2,Not as interesting as I'd hoped,"Admittedly, I was hoping for something along the lines of ""Freakonomics"" or ""Blink,"" and this just didn't quite do it for me. Honestly, I just couldn't get into it."
5,Really Enjoyed Reading this,"Whyte has a wonderful writing style and does a great job of debunking most of the political rhetoric one hears today. I read it before the most recent political season got into full gear and it gave me a great vocabulary for slicing through the vacuous positions our candidates claimed to have taken. I've used this knowledge to have much better discussions with my friends as well, keeping the arguments in the substantive side instead of drifting to the absurd."
4,Crimes Against Logic For Better Reasoning,"I was very hesitant to read this book at first. I assumed it would be extremely critical and overly dramatic given the arguments it would give as examples. After the first chapter I realized this isn't that type of book at all. Humorous, yet extremely honest author, Jamie Whyte portrays fallacy reasonings in such an understanding way. Giving relatable examples and truthful explanations, you can't help but to nod your head in agreement or have that ""ah-hah"" moment while reading it. I gained a much better understanding for reasoning and logic after reading this book and had something to laugh about as well. I recommend it for all ages, especially for young adults like me. It's important to know how to stand in your arguments and views and this book shows you how to do it."
2,Snotty and sloppy,"While the title of the book raised my expectations, the book itself disappoints. It seems to have been quickly dashed off from old anecdotes. Using religious examples to demonstrate illogic is such an easy shot. It would have been so much more interesting and arresting to use more subtle examples. Bottom line: don't waste your money on this trifle."
5,Way Overdue,"As someone who runs a group home for boys with AIDS, I know exactly how BADLY books like this are WAY overdue. The public does NOT understand how these policies (my favorite is the Bush administration's refusal to deal with international AIDS organizations who stress condoms) are constructed and how diseases like AIDS are kept alive and kicking by policies shaped with moral not scientific agendas. This is a good book and a BEGINNING not an end. American publishers are loathe to publish such books and their indifference to AIDS is nothing less than CRIMINAL. It is a CRIME that there aren't many, many books like this. Ignorance is bliss. Being informed is difficult when institutions like publishing are committed to frivolous books and entertainment versus anything that might empower people so that they understand how their institutions work."
4,Back when TV was NOT a Game Show,"With the absolute garbage on television today these DVD sets are a godsend. You get one-hundred and fifty old television shows, at least 70 hours of quality entertainment! And here's what they don't tell you in any of the ads--many of these shows run the full half hour complete with all those woderful old commercials! See the brand new 57 Chevy or the top of the line Brownie camera. Or how about Efrem plugging the next episode of the FBI this Sunday night. Great, great stuff. There are other Mill Creek boxed sets of old television shows, and there worth every penny!"
3,"Review: ""Die Toten Weg"" - ADSR","Electro-industrial akin to Darkwave brought to you by R. Wilhelm, one of the founding members of the NEC, Kill Switch...Klick, SMP and Noxious Emotion, Fockewolf was originally started as a side project to And Christ Wept.Read the full review at http://chaindlk.org/"
3,Astro Lab Planetarium,"Hi,I was expecting the planets to move electronically. But all in all I was pleased with the set-up. It was bought for a Christmas present for my 7 year old grand daughter.Also I liked the star displays it projected to the ceiling, but to get the whole picture the planetarium would have to be in the center of the room. This is not a possibility in her small room.Thank you for an opportunity to review this product.Irma I. Ruelle"
2,No Interaction,"I too thought that the planets would revolve around the sun...but they do not revolve automatically. The other review is also correct in that it really needs to be placed in the middle of the room for the star viewing. Basically this is a toy that takes up a conciderable amount of space on a shelf. There is a booklet that goes with it and tells a little about each planet. But it is not something that I would call ""fun"". My daughter loves science, but this toy just didn't draw her attention.Oh, and the little balls just sit loosely on the wires. One of them fell off and I can't find it. I tried to call the phone number in the booklet...but it says that number is no longer in service??? Does anyone have a phone number that works? Please post it if you do. Thanks."
2,Interesting...for 5 minutes,"Bought this for my 8-year old who has a keen interest in stars and planets, it was fun but difficult for a child to put together and fun/interesting to look at and play with for 5 minutes but after that, the interest is seriously limited. Not sure I'd recommend it."
2,Weird production of Abduction,"I'm very disappointed with this video presentation. The production has truly awful recording technology, so that the singer in almost inaudible when turning away from the microphone. The whole production is very boring to look at, and people seem to be standing in one spot as though trying to stay near a mic...? Not happy with it, despite admiring Hallstein's singing-- her acting is not at all interesting. Hmph."
3,Not what I expected.,"I must admit that i was expecting a teaching-book, and that's NOT what this is. The book works nice as clipart/inspiration, but hardly anything else. Thin. In series with her ""abstract art nouveau designs"", which is much the same. If you buy this book with the intention of getting a colouringbook, a book from which you can copy some designs, or similar, youll be pleased, if you want to learn about celtic design and art, try Aidan Meehan."
3,Last Junkie on Earth cd single,"A good cd and worth the purchase if you like the song, which is a little tough to find in stores."
1,Polaroid Customer Service - Are you there?,"I tried to call Polaroid customer service this morning to ask some warranty questions about their portable dvd players. I called the number they list on their website for the players. The recorded message told me that my call would be answered shortly. That irritating message continued twice a minute for the next twenty minutes, until I heard a click and was disconnected. Good luck contacting them if you have warranty issues. Try it for yourself before you buy. Polaroid, ""your fired""."
1,Esto es una pelicula....,"Este DVD es una pelicula y NO tiene control de las preguntas y respuestas. Parece un DVD que anuncia unas vacaciones en Lake Tahoo Neveda. Cuidado con este DVD, ""NO LO RECOMIENDO"". El vendedor debe REVELAR que solo una pelicula."
4,Perfect for a mood swing,"Wonderful single to have! Besides the original first two tracks, the third track concentrates on her vocals-undoubtingly beautiful and captivating. The fourth has a mysterious groove to the song that's somewhat meloncholic, even flowing to the spiritual. But the last track is more upbeat and lively, perfect if you are in a hurry to get somewhere :) Gotta have CD for our complex individualities... ~Peace~"
1,"Motherboard died after a year, no warranty left.","I purchased this for a trip to Italy. It was great while it worked.Even used it as an MP3 player. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it didn't die on me after using it only 3 times. It was in brand new condition, well taken care of but for whatever reason, the mother board went on it after 16 months. I sent it back for repair and they wanted $229 to fix it. Hardly seemed worth it since you can buy a brand new one for a little more. For me, it was a total rip off experience. I will never buy or recommend another Wolverine product again. Not only did it fail right after the warranty ended, but customer service did nothing to correct the problem except to want more money from me. I won't be surprised if others end up with this same problem. Look at another brand. This one is not reliable."
1,Run from this item!!!!!,"This player basically does nothing but make its owner jump thru hoops. Can you say work around? That's what you're in for. Can't play most formats. I haven't found a video format yet that it will play. Try creating a playlist and you might end up throwing it thru a window.Why doesn't this company create some software to run this player like everyone else does?The interface is made for a baby's fingers (e.g., the not so joyful STICK)...AND .....the remote will give you Carpal Tunnel from repeated pressing over and over with no results.ZEN's and IPODS are a pleasure to use after this thing...WOLFIE is way over priced for what you get...CONS: Everything about it. No redeeming qualities..Pros: Still looking.....but I've pretty much given up.BUY THIS IF YOU want to be frustrated...I would give this a zero star rating if I could."
3,Charm not big enough,"The charm was very deceiving when I ordered. It is very small, not at all what I expected. Picture shown for item is MUCH bigger than actual charm."
1,Doesn't dissolve in our washer,"Hi, we used this powder several times and it doesn't dissolve in our washer, no matter what cycle mode we pick. Leaves a hard-to-remove white residue on glass, plastic, etc.."
2,Didn't work well for us,"As others have said, this doesn't seem to work well with hard water because it doesn't clean well and leaves junk on dishes. Biokleen works much better for us."
2,Wish I could love it,"I've had plenty of success with other 7th Generation products and feel guilty even writing this. However, this detergent turned our glasses and stainless into white spot-ridden messes (I blamed the dishwasher first). As an experiment, I switched back to Cascade and the crusts mostly disappeared. Hope others have more success, but I advise avoidance of this product."
1,DIDN'T DISSOLVE IN SOFT WATER EITHER!,"This was the first of several Earth Friendly automatic dishwasher detergents I tried. I really wanted to like it but after washing several loads of dishes with it always leaving a white powder residue on the dishes I gave up and trashed it. YES, I did pre-rinse and used a rinse agent also. It just wouldn't dissolve in our water and our water is very soft. If your stubborn like me, you may try it anyway but I will never buy it again. I just didn't get the same results as the 5 star reviews. I switched to Ecover Dishwasher Tabs and have had no problems or complaints."
1,"Good product, Bad Bad Amazon","Previously when I purchased this, I received it, one of the boxes tore open during shipment. I complained to Amazon but they wanted me to ship it back, which is a hassle. I figured the amount I was saving I can lose half a box. This time I opened the box and not only was one box missing, 4 of the seven were half empty and were taped up. and the other three didn't seem completely full either. How could Amazon be so careless to ship this out. It seems that someone also received a bad box and returned it then Amazon did not check it and sent it out. Amazon can not send out bulky items like this and not ensure no damage. It was too much work for me."
1,Could ruin your dishwasher,This stuff is AWFUL. At first I noticed that ALL of my glasses had junk stuck to them..then the entire dishwasher clogged up with suds and it took us a day to clean it! I would choose something else...the laundry detergent is just as bad.
1,Doesn't clean my dishes,"Unless the dishes are perfectly clean before going into the dishwasher, this detergent doesn't work. It didn't clean my tea cup, which Cascade does. It didn't remove a bit of cake residue on a glass pan; of course, after the pan has been through the entire dishwasher cycle, and the brown bits are still stuck to the pan, they are much, much harder to remove.Sorry; I tried to be ""green"". But if I have to run a lot more hot water and use a lot of soap in the sink to perfectly prewash each and every dish before I put it in the dishwasher, that's not too green, either. And since the dishwasher is supposed to be a labor saving device, this soap is causing it to become a more labor intensive device. I cancelled my automatic shipment option on this, and I'll be forced to go to one of the ""big box stores"" and stock up on Cascade.Don't waste your money."
2,"OK, but not perfect","I like to use environmentally friendly products whenever possible, but unfortunately this stuff leaves little soap particles all over my dishes, even when everything is well-rinsed prior to loading. Bummer."
1,makes your dishes smell foul,"when my wife had a glass of water, it smelled stale, and than had pure spring water the same than we rinsed the glass with regular antibacterial liquid detergent and it smelled clean. the problem is the seventh generation dish washing powder detergent. it sticks to the dishes and makes them smells foul.the dishwasher supplied by the building is a GE and the water here is about 110 degrees, note the GE dishwasher does not heat up the water further. so the detergent simply sticks and smells.the detergent i have is ""improved formula"""
4,"Great, but have to follow directions","I love this product. It cleans very very well and is great for the environment and my family's health. However, if you have soft water you MUST fill the cups less than full to have it clean effectively and remove all the powder residue from dishes. I also think the reviewer that speaks about product getting old on the shelf is onto something. I have problems more often when it is an older box that seems to have taken on moisture...the box clumps up a little and I have to shake it to break it up. Those seem to be the times I have more problems with some powder remaining. When I use less than half a compartment full it seems to clean the same and leaves no residue. Occasionally I have a tapered sippy cup or glass that needs rinsing out just to be sure, but if that is all I have to do for my part in helping the health of my family and the environment then I can do that."
3,$34.99 lasted six months but maybe Arm&Hammer would be just as effective,"I switched to this because it's safe and unfancy but it didn't do as an effective cleaning my greasy pan. A consumer comparison show reported that the biodegradeable claim for this product is a marketing tool only.I am half way through the order so buying in bulk wasn't so bad for me. I hate having to go back to the store to replenish on nonperishables. Women spend 8 YEARS of their lives on grocery shopping unless they live in an eat out culture such as Thailand in which case they shop for something else.After I used up this product, I did not reorder."
1,Does not work at all,This detergent clogged our dishwasher and left white residue on glasses. We had to rewash dishes which made it use more water and detergent. It is not environmentally friendly when you think about water waste. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Have to handwash after use,"This doesn't fully dissolve and leaves food and dish detergent powder on the dishes, despite having a new dishwasher.Try Ecover, works better.Ecover Automatic Dishwashing Tablets, 17.6-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)"
1,Hello soap scum!,"I didn't buy this from Amazon but I still had to leave feedback here because this product was sooo bad, We use a lot of Seventh Generation (and Mrs. Meyers and Shaklee's, etc.). We ran out of our Shaklee dishwasher powder detergent so I bought some Seventh Generation to replace it. It left massive amounts of soap scum. To the point where my dishes were cleaner when I put them in dirty! And then I would try to run those dishes in there over again and they were still bad. And then I hand-washed them and the soap scum still wouldn't come off! Suffice it to say, I am all for ecological, but I would never buy this product again. In fact, who wants a barely used box up for grabs?"
1,Ruined our dishwasher,Leaves a residue. Does not clean dishes. Did not dissolve and actually clogged the sprayer arms in our dishwasher which we had to replace.
2,Not powerful enough,"This detergent might be environmentally friendly, but its cleaning power has something to be desired. For baked-on, ground in messes, it does nothing. I am the type to let the sink fill up, rarely rinsing off dishes, then I fill the dishwasher. This detergent does not have the power to clean tough. I ran the dishes through twice with more detergent. Needs improvement."
1,Residue,Leaves a residue that has to be washed off by hand. Canceled my Suscribe/Save for this product. Don't waste your money.
4,Great Eco-Friendly Option,"Seventh Generation's Automatic Dishwasher Powder is great. I love that it cleans our dishes without the harmful addition of bleach. However, the one downside is because it does not have bleach or ammonia if we leave the dishes washed and don't open the door at least a crack all the dishes will smell musty. I think this is a small price to pay for much safer product for my family though."
2,Etches Plastics,"Every time I run my dishwasher with one of the major brands of dishwasher detergent, my son has an asthma attack. First, I tried the Seventh Generation powdered dishwasher detergent. My son didn't have asthma attacks with it, but it etched my plastics badly. Then I tried the Seventh Generation Lemon gel. It does not cause my son to have asthma attacks and it doesn't etch my plastics. I definitely recomend the gel. I have recently started using the Seventh Generation Laundry detergent, and I like that, too."
1,leaves residue on dishes,This product leaves residue on all my dishes. I love my other 7th Gen products but will not be buying this one again. :(
4,Great alternative to Phosphate,"We had hard water in both our city house and now in our country house. (no, we don't own two homes!) Worked well in both types of hard water. We even have a cheapy portable dishwasher too. I do a quick rinse and then the wash, sometimes not directly after. I don't use a rinse agent. I do let the water heat up before starting either the rinse or the wash."
5,Much better than expected!,"Like a lot of people, I thought it was time to go green with my various cleaning soaps. I was surprised that 7th Gen powder did so well in my 20 year old dishwasher (granted, we do not have hard water in my area). Better than the top selling mainstream brands. When I ran out of the 7th Gen., I tried the Whole Foods 365 store brand and have been terribly disappointed. I've been pre-washing much more than I ever have before.I understand that people are worried that 7th Gen. will make some compromises now that the brand is being sold at WalMart. I certainly hope not. This is a wonderful product!"
3,Not recommended for hard water,"Unfortunately, I do not recommend this product for hard water. As soon as I started using it, it left a build up on all of my dishes. The dishwasher repair man (I thought my dishwasher was broken) explained that phosphates are required for hard water. I can continue to use the S. G. product, but I have to add 1 Tbs. phosphates to it. I also tried running a cycle with vinegar. That helped, but not quite as much as did adding the phosphates to the detergent. Just thought I'd post this info, as many people in my area have hard water and have experienced this same issue with the product."
1,"bad shipping, left residue","This product certainly had ""green-appeal"" which is why we ordered it.Unfortunately, 1 of the shipped boxes was damaged, resulting in some spilled powder and difficulty dispensing it.Worse, in my dishwasher, we often had powder residue especially on glasses, so we had to wash them again afterwards.We switched toCascade Complete All in 1 Pacs, 48-Count Containerand have had no issues since."
4,Great product for the price,"I use Seventh Generation products all the time. It can get a bit pricey though. Buying it in the 75 oz. 8-pk, I saved a lot of money. It comes out to $5 per box when I buy it in bulk from Amazon."
4,College Student Friendly!,"This tripod was exactly what I was looking for. For the amateur photographer, the price is right, and the quality is first rate. The leg locks hold fast, and all the joints are molded to a high enough degree of precision as to keep them from slipping. The result is that your camera will stay where you want it, and when your all done the tripod folds up small enough to fit just about anywhere. I was personally very impressed with this product."
1,Built very cheap!!!!!!,I bought this tripod and within one week the center gear for height adjustment stripped out therefore height unusable. The whole casing around crank leaver is made of plastic and gear is made of the cheap white metal. Quality is not worth having. Take some advice spend a little more money and buy you a good one so you don't end up in the same shape I am in.
4,great buy for an amatuer photographer,"a great buy indeed. I looked at the customer opinions before buying this one and i wasnt dissapointed. Its got an amazing set of features for the money you put in. The only complaint is that, you have to handle it a bit carefully and not roughly, because the material its made up of, its not too great. That apart its a great value for money."
3,lasts about two days,My daughter got it for christmas and is very careful with her toys. It lasted last than a week and I returned it.
3,One of the first books about the Mig29,The first book I bought about the Mig29 in 1994. A good introduction to the Mig29.
1,Simulated societies doubtful value,"If you like to be manipulated, then by all means, play this game. I have grave doubts about the value of these exercises, or at least the conditions under which they are often administrated. I think it is downright dangerous to mess with people's heads, and try to get them into conflict.So often these simulations are done in situations where the players are forced unknowing into ""playing"" by an employer or a school. There is no attempt to discover the stability of the players and no follow-up to discover if there are any lasting negative effects from the ""play."" I call that more than a little irresponsible. How this game develops leadership is a mystery to me. This is a gravy boat for someone, but not for the participants."
2,Actual content of kit does not match description,"I didn't receive what was described in the online ad. What I got was 1 sausage stuffing attachment, 4 cutters and a 40 page booklet entitled ""Sausage Making at Home"". The kit number was correct so I assume that the description was never updated to match the actual kit contents. I wouldn't recommend this kit."
1,DOES NOT FIT THE GRINDER,THEY HAVE ALSO BOUGHT WITH THIS PRODUCT ON AMAZON SITE. I BELIEVES THAT THIS WOULD FIT AND MAKE MY GRINDER BETTER SO I GOT SET. THEY DO NOT FIT THE GRINDER I GOT FROM THE AMAZON AND WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING THAT THEY SAY WILL GO WITH SOMETHING THEY SAY GOES WITH THE PRODUCT I PUCHASE.
4,A view from the inside,"I thought this was an excellent book from the view of a cfl official. It shows how seriously each of the officials take their jobs and the tradition of doing a good job. Although they had fun along the way, the job was always taken seriously. If you are interested in seeing the game from a different view, this is a very good book."
4,Show Me How,"Lorrie Morgan returns with her first new studio album since 1999's MY HEART. In 2000 she released another compilation, and in 2001 a duets album with her husband Sammy Kershaw. In 2002 there was a live album. SHOW ME HOW is a good album, start to finish. The first single is ""Do You Still Want To Buy Me That Drink? (Frank)"" which is about a single mom who is starting to date again. Not a favorite, but it's ok. She does a wonderful version of Bekka Bramlett's ""Used"". As she approaches middle age, she looks at it sardonically on the uptempo ""Bombshell"". ""Us Girls"" is a power anthem. It's refreshing to hear a country artist break down stereotypes and boundaries of Nashville, like Lorrie does on the closing track ""Rocks"", which is an anti-racism/anti-homophobic song. Other highlights include the title track, ""I Can Count On You"", ""The Wedding"", and more. Overall a nice album."
2,Not one of her best,This CD tends to take Lorrie through all the things we have heard from her before. Time forsome new things - this one is notit.
5,SHOW ME HOW to make a great album!!,"Lorrie Morgan has done it again with a great album! I have listened to it non-stop since getting my hands on it! If you have ever liked Lorrie Morgan, or been interested in her career at all, you must own this album! All of the big reviews (Billboard, All Music Guide, etc.) have called it one of the best in her career, and I would agree. It is a great mixture of music and a great mix of sounds. Each track is unique, and you can really feel the love that Lorrie. the musicians, producers, and writers have put into the album. Take it from me... It is worth the buy!"
3,the good is mixed in with the bad,"As a Christian I recoiled at the idea of making an altar to pagan gods or saying the prayers and meditations given in the book so I skipped that part. There is no way I'm becoming a vegatarian and I have no desire to spend all my evenings in the bathroom thanks to the endless enemas and purges the author reccomnends. Other than that advice on herbal medicine and surprisingly, the advice on marriage and creating a happy family was excellent. The reader will simply have to take what they can from the book and leave the rest."
2,Too many prayers and affirmations,"I was looking for something more practical and less idealistic. About 80 percent of the book is prayers and affirmations. She did not even bother to discuss tampons and pads. There are some good things in the book, but not enough for me to recommend this book."
5,Healing,I am glad that I found this book. It has helped start my process of healing. I recommend this to any woman.. doesnt matter the race or religion
3,Very surprise,"Received book on time. Very, very, very Surprise. The book was from a library that was biscarded. Like when they get rid of books for free. If I wanted a library book I would go to the library. O"
2,I was disappointed,"When I purchased this book I couldn't wait to get it in the mail. I was SO excited about learning about how to ""eat"" for womb health but what I came across was a lot of reference to some healthy womb god idol? I don't know, I was very put off by the constant references to this idol god, and womb circle chants that she suggest we do? I thought I would be able to take from it what I could use, and discard everything else but the references were too frequent, and it put a really bad taste in my mouth, I felt I was being exposed to things that were very oddly relgious, (non-christian) and I am not interested in that. I purchased the book in hopes that I'd learn to eat a certain way for an overall healthy womb, but got a lot of other weird stuff, that made me uneasy, I couldn't finish the book."
5,Every Woman's Bible,I have never read a book that made so much sense. This book is the ultimate guidebook for obtaining optimal health - spiritually and physically. Some of the techniques offered are so simple that you wonder why you have not lived accordingly all of your life. I cannot stress enough how important this book is to securing a healthy life. Don't pass this one by.
5,A must have for every woman.,"Women, get in touch with your womb. She is the seat of our creativity and feminine power. Love her. Embrace her.This book is beyond words. It gives step by step, daily healing activities that one can easily apply to improve the health and function of their womb. Open your heart and start to cleanse and heal."
5,"Sacred Woman: A guide to healing the feminine Body, Mind & Spirit","I find this book to be like a mini healing bible. If you are on a journey to healing, this is a must read. As always choose what works for you. Peace and many blessings."
5,A non-fiction Lord of the Flies,"This amazing tale is seen through the eyes of the child the author was at the time, rather than through the filter of adult wisdom and judgement. That is what gives this terrifying and funny book its power.As a fourteen year-old boy Gao Yuan attended a boarding school that became caught up in the wildness of the Cultural Revolution. He experienced the foolishness of the children and their terrible violence as they turned on each other. At the same time his father was being pilloried at home.This is a great yarn about a surreal world, as well as an important historical document."
4,You Done Good Donald! Pt. I,"These Nails...These Nail... a women named Blanche ( I'm probaly spelling her name wrong) sings the lead, let me just tell you she is singing it in Tenor, and she holds her own. Her voice is the bomb, the words to the song are minister. This is my favorite song on this album. This is a good album. Buy it, for These Nails alone! I'm tryin to tell ya!"
5,Another chart topper.,"This CD (Finale Act One & Act Two) is fantastic. I had to leave work to go pick it up because several people in my office had downloaded it from iTunes this morning before work. I heard three of the tracks, and just decided to take an early lunch.....a good decision. This CD is a blessing."
2,This ....saddens me,"Gintama is one of my favorite series that was taken to the states, not only did they not dub this series, but charge as much as it would cost to buy a dub, but only add 13 episodes with some of the worst subtitles I've ever seen. Yellow Subtitles? Seriously? That's hard on the eyes and makes it even less fun to watch. This is the first product I bought from Sentai Filmworks, and I will say, I am severely angry how they portrayed this awesome anime."
3,It's okay.,"With all the praise I've been hearing, I expected more from this anime, but I found that it's just mediocre.There's just so much better anime out there, that my expectations might be a bit high.I'd give 2.5 stars for average, but I can't really do that, so I'll round up to 3."
2,Good Price Value but in Japanese Audio,"I read somewhere that Gintama was a good series so I decided to give it a try. I found it online, and at a very good price, but I didn't notice that it was in Japanese Audio with English subtitles. It was hard the follow all the action, take in the graphics, which is what I value most in Anime. The subtitles move pretty fast on the screen so it is pretty hard to take every thing in. If you can get the English audio versions, look for them first, even if you have to pay a little bit extra."
3,sleepy old 97s,Those fans wishing for a return to the glory days of Wreck your Life and Too Far to Care can keep wishing because Drag it Up could very well be called Drag Me Down. It's not that this is a bad record it's just not all that exciting. There are a few track standouts like New Kid and Smokers but too many slow mellow tunes litter this release. I will put in Beck's Sea Change to mellow out not the Old 97s. I hope the next release from this band really rocks in a twangy way not put me to sleep.
2,Drag It Up should be titled Just A Drag,"Im sorry to the folks that are really looking forward to this cus its just not that good. I was really excited about the comeback and bought the cd today for $14...Big Mistake! The cd is slow, poorly recorded, lackluster, and worst of all Rhett Miller's lyrics just arent that good. This cd is even more dissapointing than Instigator. To potential fans don't start with this cus you'll probably leave thinking that this GREAT band is crap. Maybe these songs will be better live, I am looking forward to that."
4,A retreat to earlier values...,"This is a good album, albeit not great. Probably ranks right above Fight Songs in my own personal ranking of Old 97's releases (Fight Songs being my least fave).Still, a good piece of work given the amount of other crap out there these days. Personal faves include:1. Won't Be Home2. Moonlight3. Borrowed Bride8. In the Satellite Rides a Star9. The New Kid10. Bloomington11. Adelaide12. Friends ForeverSo, eight out of 13 ain't bad. Heck, even Ken Bethea's ""zydeco-style"" tune grows on you. One complaint - the mix is fairly poor - no sound depth."
3,Drag It Up,"Satallite Rides, unfortunately, might be the Old 97's pinnacle. It's not a bad pinnacle to rise to; the incredibly catchy ""Rollerskate Skinny"" pairs well with the beautifully earnest ""Question"" and ""Annette"" not to mention a slew of other tracks that are worthy to be on the LP.So when the album was released, all I really wanted was some more of this mix: some really poppy tunes that I know would be incredible live (Old 97's have always shined most when the charismatic Rhett Miller has the stage) and some songs that are understated, simplistic, and earnest.""I Won't Be Home"" opens the album successfully. In fact, it's ""Rollerskate Skinny"" quality. Unfortunately, the albums beginning after that is mediocre. It's certainly not bad; it's just Old 97's without spunk. The good news is that it really picks up with ""The New Kid"" and ""Bloomington."" The bad news is that if you're like me, you'll be wishing for Satallite Rides Pt. 2 when you're done."
4,Stands on It's Own,"I never thought I was guilty of this, but today I realized it. I couldn't listen Drag It Up without immediately comparing to classics like Too Far to Care and Satellite Rides or even the pop gems Fight Songs and Rhett's solo The Instigator. But, alas I did.Drag It Up is a much more somber affair than any of the Old 97's previous albums and reverts back to the country stylizings of their older records rather push further into the pop arena. However, they still manage ro produce a fairly solidly sounding album (I think the non-Rhett songs don't hold up quite as well). It might be better to listen to after midnight. If you want a powerful energy boost, listen to the raving rock of Too Far to Care, but if your in the mood for well put together melancholy alt. country this is your ticket.If you can you should really catch these guys live, the versions of these songs live are awesome particularly ""Won't Be Home""."
3,band feeling the effects of Rhett's solo career,"I'm a huge Old 97s fan and see them every time they come to town. I have to rate this as their least solid album. There are a few geat tracks (New Kid, Won't be Home, Satellite Rides a Star) but overall the album is a bit too monotonous, and 3 or 4 are defintitely filler, or sound too much like blander versions of old tunes on other albums. I am afraid that Rhett pursuing a solo career simultaneously means some of the pop tracks that would build up this album are missing. Instead, they are on his solo album. Hey, this band has 5 great albums and one so-so album. I miss the diversity, but still pretty good. If you are new to the band get Too Far to Care, Satellite Rides, or Fight Songs and work your way from there."
3,Not What I expected,"Maybe it's me, but I fist got turned onto the Old 97s after seeing them in concert and not knowing any songs. I was blown away by their musicianship, live show, and Rhett Miller's energy onstage. Went out and bought all the albums and have seen them (or Rhett solo) whenever they come to the NYC area. Needless, to say, I love the 97's when they rock out!!! To me, this album seems a little to mellow for my tastes. I was expecting TFTC or Satellite Rides I guess. I've heard the new songs in concert and loved them, but for some reason, don't like them on the album. Maybe the boys can put a live album out next? (Hint, hint, hint)."
4,timeless voice,"Shira Myrow's voice is irresistably sweet and timeless. She sounds like a prohibition era jazz singer hiding in some smoky back room. Chris Bruce, who is my personal hero, produced this album, (and plays guitar) and it is a gem. The cover of Temptation is haunting and all the songs are winners, subtle and penetrating."
3,antoinette roberson shines!,"though the ""soap opera remix edit"" is incredibly corny (it gets a little more opera than soap opera), it's worth enduring to be exposed again, no matter how briefly, to antoinette roberson's stunning vocals. known in clubland as the frontwoman for pulse, roberson soars on ""lover that you are"". here, she tries her hand at r&b with startling success, providing ""the other side of the story"" as gerald levert portrays a father fighting to keep custody of his children in a bitter divorce. although the couple's dispute is, at times, troubling to witness, both artists' performances are stellar."
2,Quite pleasant,HAAND KE PAAR CHALO is one of those routine films that has nothing new to say. Everything is so predictable. It looks like a film straight out of the 1980s.Music [Vishnu Narayan] is quite pleasant.
3,Anthology for the military minded,"I like strong female characters and often in science fiction and fantasy this means military women. So I picked up this book at a sci fi convention thinking there'd be a few stories in an anthology that would be worth the cost. Out of 15 stories, four of them grabbed me. I'd want to read these four, by Sharon Lee & Steve Miller, Rosemary Edghill, Kerrie Hughes, and Robin Wayne Bailey, over again. The others were ok stories but none of those characters really grabbed me the way those four did. If you like military matters more or questions about what is right and wrong in terms of military violence then I'm sure you'll like the book better than I did."
3,Generally Unfocused,"Although some of the stories in this collection are good, for the most part, they seem to have an unfocused theme. True, many of them include warrior women, but some of them only seem to have a taste of it.Overall, I thought this was an okay collection, although not spectacular.One high point was Michelle West's contribution, which explains the establishment of the Black Ospreys. A beautiful addition to her primary universe."
5,AMPERAGE LISTED IS INCORRECT,"Your welder on this page is #2060. Your banner says #2060 welder is a 70 AMP welder. The description of this welder in the body of the descriptions says #2060 is a 90 AMP welder. All company adds show that the 2060 is a 90 AMP Welder...however, your banner seems to be incorrect. You might wish to change it...on all the other sites -- even the Campbell Hausfeld site shows the #2060 as a 90 AMP WELDER...On all other sites...the #2060 is a 90 AMP wleder for around $284. the #2050 is a 70 AMP and sells for $199. Persons wishing to purchase this welder will not purchase because of the inaccurate listing...it looks like a bad deal...however...if corrected to #2060 90 AMP...rather than 2050 70 AMP...it looks normal. Bottom line...your listing of #2060 is correct...as your description says...but only one word...70 AMP in the title is wrong."
1,No go,"Bad out of the box. Wouldn't feed wire at all. Returned the product and bought a different brand locally. Probably just one of those things, but unacceptable to me."
2,Didn't really do what it was supposed to,"Im not an experienced welder but i did what some online welding guides showed me, and this just would not make a clean weld. I tried getting Gas and switching to MIG and it did even worse. It seemed to not be penetrating deep enough into the metal. I bought a small lincoln electric welder and all my problems vanished.Maybe if you are a pro it will work just fine for you."
2,You get what you pay for,"It worked just fine for a while, when I attached a bottle to MIG weld instead of Flux Core the line leaked. The system used for the gas line was poorly designed. When I called the company they wanted $100 for the replacement part.Overall it is an OK piece of equipment, but it is really a flux core welder not much of a MIG welder"
1,very unreliable - not worth it,"I've had to repair this welder every time I've used it. I bought it in March 2006, and have used it maybe a dozen times. The welding wire constantly gets jammed and kinked inside the spiral feeder tube, requiring me to disassemble the feeder and the trigger handle. The design of the trigger handle is such that the finger switch wires get pinched between the handle halves. The final straw was when the spiral feeder tube got pulled into the wire bundle in a way that can no longer be repaired. This welder is now in my trash can.I should have just bought a stick welder."
1,Better Used for Kiln Fuel,"This book contains no valuble recipies. All of the earthenware stuff is lead based and most of the other recipies use stains and other pre-made colors, one ""recipie"" specifies to use 100% of a commercial red glaze, with no modifications at all. This book is such a waste."
5,A SCHOLARLY BIBLE MADE FOR EVERYONE,"You won't waste your money if you buy this bible. YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. This bible is an ecumenical work of different denomination scholars, well known theologians."
1,Not Correct,It was not the correct bible. The one sent contained the Apocrypha. The one I ordered should not have contained the extra books of the bible.
2,A nice fairy tale,"The humans like very much fairytales: White Snow, Peter Pan or Alice, are curious and useful pieces to work the child imagination. The author seems to look this ""luminous lady"" that came from the sky in a light a good religious tale. Very different is the truth Fatima story, but this one is for adults and was written by Portuguese historians Dr. Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada in ""Celestial Secrets"" and ""Heavenly Lights"". Onde day in the future the children of our times will learn another fantastic story. Very close to a fairytale, but a true one."
2,Only for starters,"The ideas presented although sound are just too brief. For folks who have been working for years one can quote probably countless more scenarios that are left unexplored.For example, the topic of backstabbing was just touched within a solitary chapter near the end of the book. The fact is, the general rule still applies irregardless of whether one buys this book or not, 1) build a rock solid foundation, build your reputation and keep to your end of the bargain. Which is good and hard honest work. Unfortunately, that cant keep you alive in a politically rife environment.So identifying a political mindfield is just half of the battle. The next battle is, how to convince your peers to see the bigger picture and work towards a win/win situation where everyone succeeds. For a book entitled Positive Politics this area was never even mentioned.I'm giving it 2 stars, cause it's not worth the money I've paid for it, the book lacks depth."
2,We must fight the Left,"Why would anyone want leftist socialism to win anywhere in the world? A powerful government always takes from the people. For those in America, think about it. Imagine more government in our lives, then imagine the Bush Administration taking control again. Imagine if Bush could ration wealth or Healthcare. Who do you think would get the Lions share? Just because Obama believes in equality for all, make sure that is never enforced through income distribution and government rationing. The tide can always turn and it is next to impossible to gain control back from the government once you relinquish it. Just remember the Bush years, and imagine if they had full control to promote more of their cronyism onto our lives. For example making sure that every seed offered to civilians was sponsored and grown by Monsanto, the government approved fruit and vegetable seed."
4,The United States in Central America,"U.S. policy in Latin America has served as a model for actions throughout the world especially the Middle East according to ""Empire's Workshop"". This book can serve an important function as an introduction to the role of the United States in creating and supporting right wing dictatorships, military coups against democratically elected governments and rule by terror.El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua became, in Grandin's words, ""the last killing fields of the Cold War"" as the U.S., in the name of anti-communism, supported what became a capitalist jihad against any organizations that they felt could threaten their rule. Rural co-operatives, trade unions and anti-impunity coalitions (people who wanted to bring murderers to justice) were targeted. Their leaders were killed and their members were terrorized. The army officers and noncoms who carried out the killing and torture were trained in the United States under the guidance of the U.S. Southern Command."
4,Empire's Workshop,"Book is thoroughly researched. Reads as somewhat dry, but the author does an incredible job at tying together complicated areas of American foreign policy in Latin America and history to weave a cogent and scary picture of imperialism and its effects. I could see this book being a must read in a university political science course."
3,Incredible audio,"I loved the DVD, he is a real legend to watch, just a class act and a great band backing him up."
1,whole Lotta Love....that's it.,"Until they get into adding stupid new musical intervals into the song Whole Lotta Love, it is the only decent song worth listening to here. Plant even ruined Gallows Pole with a new retarded Robert Plant twist. Robert please get back with Zeppelin, do your solo stuff too but at least your true rock fans will have something with your amazing vocals to enjoy as well."
4,Loved It!,I really loved this show. Mighty Rearranger is Robert's best album so far and this show is a wonderful performance (I wish I could have been there). I would have loved to have seen more on the dvd- maybe other songs/takes from other venues and a behind-the-scenes to meet the band and hear about the songwriting. Check out itunes for more live segments from the tour and a great Fresh Air interview to promote the greatest hits collection pre and post Zep.
5,must have,This was a must have after seeing this performance on tv.great versions of classic songs as well as new compositions.A really good band to back up this legendary performer
4,Very cool twist,Everyone knows how great he is. This is an interesting twist on Zeppelin tunes etc. with a very tight band. I really liked it. It's fun to see the greats change it up and grow. If you like Plant and or Zep. Buy it.
2,Nice show but....,"This concert just didn't do it for me. The video & sound quality are great but I wish he would have left the old Zep tunes in their original form. Plant was on a PBS Sound Stage back in the late nineties which was fantastic. He did Ramble On, Thank You, What Should Be and..., Going to California, If I Were A Carpenter, and an assortment of newer stuff. It was recorded in Switzerland. I really wish I could find that one.This is a good DVD. It just didn't do it for me.I'm still a fan so I'll keep it."
3,Robert Plant-Soundstage,"It's alright. Save your money or don't pay full retail price because this is only for die hards like me. I saw this show outside and live in Albuquerque and it was much better than inside this sterile stage setting in Hollywood or Orlando? I would rather see the subject focused on 90% of the time rather than about 60% of the time because I pay to see the headliner and not the backup musicians. It is also only about 3/4ths of the songs he does live too...I mean a 90 minute show turns into a 60 minute DVD. Why can't we get the whole show up front n'yo face and watch him sweat...like Janis Joplin, Tina Turner, Mick Jagger? Come on Robert...work it next time!"
5,AMAZING,I absolutely LOVE this DVD. Robert's voice is STILL awesome and I cannot get enough of him! Wish he'd put out MORE DVD's similar to this one! I'd buy all of them. Another great DVD is No Quarter. Equally amazing. His talents are endless....
4,Poke Robert with a stick - a bit subdued,I liked this video and I have watched it several times. Musically the playing/singing was great but maybe the editing made the overall performance seem subdued. Did someone shoot Robert Plant with thorazine? I always try to make sure and see him play when he comes to town (which isn't often). I have never seen a bad performance (even if don't always get what he is doing musically at the time). Although I have never seen the Stange Sensation; the Robert Plant I have seen live in concert was a lot more lively than the Robert Plant in this video. Even the audience seems disengaged and subdued - perhaps it is the strange part of the strange sensation? or maybe the vibe of the sensation itself?If you are a die-hard Robert Plant fan than this is a good video with great music. I gave it 4 stars for the music only.
2,grandma,"I bought this item for my daughter-in-law. This bassinet is beautiful online. When it arrived and we proceeded to put it together one of the side pieces had two left legs instead of a left leg and a right leg. We had to redrill all holes in order for it to match. Also one of the rails were broken.(poorly packaged) Also I do not like the exposed meatal screws on top railing of bassinet, very tacky looking. Canopy does not fit properly. Also sheet was thread bare, I'm afraid to wash it."
3,Bassinet: 5 stars Bedding: 1 star Overall: 3 stars,"The Good:The bassinet is sturdy. Unlike many bassinets, it seems strong and could definitely hold much, much more than the 20 lb. weight limit (not that I'm recommending you ignore the weight limit).The shelf underneath is great.It has wheels so you can easily move it around the room.The Not-So-Good:If you want to move it into another room, you will need to take it apart, as it will not fit through standard doorways. (I did realize this before I bought it, but still felt it should be mentioned.)The bedding shrinks....a lot. I had to sew extra ribbons onto the bumper to pull the top back. Otherwise, it curled inward.Several of the ribbons frayed in the wash. Of course, I had to replace them with new ribbons.UPDATE: I have contacted the manufacturer about the problems that I had with the bedding. They have promised to send me replacements."
3,Static and Low Volume,"My daughter received the Barbie Walkie Talkies for Christmas. I was dissappointed with them; however, my daughter thinks they are great(so far). There are only two prerecorded messages, so the manufacturers review as well as Amazon's are misleading. The ""send"" button: ""Hi, this is Barbie"",and the ""end"" button: ""Goodbye"". There is constant static and even with the volume switch turned up as high as it will go, the speaker has to be just inches away from your ear to hear well. The Educational Value...Kids should learn to be patient and courtious while talking and listening (not talking over someone while the other person in talking)."
1,the cheapest toy in the world,"i truly agree with what the other people are saying about this toy because when i was about 8 years old, we went and bought these walkie talkies. the first tme i put some fresh batteries that had never been used and my brother and i tested them out. they would not even work from the distance from my room to his room and that is not even two miles. i was really upset because i was really excited about getting this toy. so we went back to where we had purchased it from and we bought another one. when i got home, that one didn't work either. i think that people shouldn't put out toys that they know don't work because they don't care bout you and the toy, i feel that they only care bout the money. that is when i decided that i was never ever gonna buy anymore barbie products. only the barbie shop with me cash register."
2,Not A Good Buy!,"I bought these for my granddaughter for Christmas. They did not operate well so we installed new batteries and they didn't work any better. I now have to buy another set for more money, which is probably what I should have done in the first place.Janet L."
1,Returning Them,"They were a dissapointment as they were not really walkie-talkies as you couldn't really communicate with them. The volume control only adjusted the loudness of the static on each unit. But, for [the price] we shouldn't have expected much.There were a couple of pre-recorded Barbie messages on each one which was fun for about 5 seconds. Our five-year old daughter requested we return them so she could pick something else out. She had never before requested to return any Barbie product."
1,What a Waste of Money,Don't buy this item! All you hear is static and you litterally have to yell into it to hear. Huge dissapointment!
1,Talking Trash,My daughters could not have been more disappointed with this product. Even with a pair of new batteries they could not communicate from one room to the next. Mattel management should be ashamed!
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,My niece was so disappointed Christmas morning when she opened the walkie talkies only to find out they don't work at all. Forget 100 feet away...try 1 foot - ...
1,This toy is a huge waste,"If I could give this toy zero stars, I would. My daughter received this for her birthday today, and we are taking it back tomorrow. Same complaints as the other reviewers. Basically, I'm very disappointed in the poor quality of the toy in general. My daughter gets frustrated easily, and this had her in tears after about 10 seconds. She just couldn't understand why it wouldn't work. Too bad. It was a great idea with very poor execution."
1,BIG Disappointment!,"We bought these last year for our 5 year old. When she and her older sister played with them, they had to stand within 10 feet of eachother to be make out what the other was saying. The static was also terrible. A week later my daughter accidently dropped one of them and it quit working completely. BIG waste of money!"
1,the cheapest toy in the world,"...when i was about 8 years old, we went and bought these walkie talkies. the first tme i put some fresh batteries that had never been used and my brother and i tested them out. they would not even work from the distance from my room to his room and that is not even two miles. i was really upset because i was really excited about getting this toy. so we went back to where we had purchased it from and we bought another one. when i got home, that one didn't work either. ..."
1,Not impressed,"Well, I did not even get the item pictured, it was a Barbie set but not the same one shown. They dont work for beans. You have to scream into them to hear anything on the other end, and you talk into what you would think would be the ear part...Junk. Glad I didnt Pay $20 for these. I would of sent them back!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I purchased this for my grandchild for her Birthday. She was very excited when she opened the package and wanted batteries installed immediately! Her father did just that, but they didn't work. We packaged them up, returned them and received a new set. Sadly we had the same experience with them so they were also returned. We are not going to try another set. It was very disappointing and certainly not expected with the ""BARBIE"" name on it!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Please! Don't waste your money and disappoint a little girl with this toy. My girls were so excited to get batteries for the walkie talkies. Unfortunately, they had to wait a whole day. What a let down! These things did not work without yelling as loud as possible into one of the receivers to hear the barely audible voice on the other end."
1,Useless,I zeroed my rifle with this product as pr instructions then went to the range to verify and tweak the alignment. At 50 yards from a bench rest the impact point was not even on the paper target. Way off both vertically and horizontally. Useless product.
2,BOOO,This brand kind of sucked. I really prefer the NOW tyrosine. could not feel anything with this brand. 500 mg tyrosine works best but then again i havent tried higher. Tyrosine gives me the feeling of wanting to do something and kind of helps depression. good stuff
5,Get it!,"Superbly documented, few issues. Easily the best book covering the TWR years. Chassis history is a plus. Could have used more imagess perhaps."
5,Wonderful!!,"Shirl Henke does it again!! Produces another wonderful novel guaranteed to make you laugh and cry. Cain, so named because he killed his own brother, is such a tortured hero that your heart will cry out for him. Through the course of the novel, Cain learns to believe in himself. For if there ever is a man who needs to believe in himself and love himself, Cain is one. He despises the Indian side of him and yearns to be white. By reading the novel, you will learn what it is like to be caught between two worlds, neither very accepting of half-bloods. You will follow Cain's physical and emotional struggles to reach a goal that he neither knew he had and thought unatanable. This is a wonderful story!!"
4,Very good book,"Good story, good characters, good use of unusual words (which made me pull out my dictionary a few times) and wonderful descriptions of events, places, and people. One scene the ""Medicine Lodgepole Dance"" was hard to read and not squirm at the pain the indians endured to become ""men""/""warriors"". The love story part of this book was good. The sex scenes were numerous and detailed, almost too many; but it has been a long time since I had read a HR book. I appreciated the lack of curse words and ugly crude language. If you like Historical Romances, then you will enjoy this book."
5,Great book,This is quite an interesting book on leadership. Most chapters are quite easy to follow if you are not an expert on leadership.
3,Nice try at forcing suspense,"I agree with the review of Kirkus Reviews. The author tries hard to make the search for the John Barry exciting but the ending is anti-climactic, to say the least. The book is very self-serving for the searchers and adds little to solving the mystery of the SS John Barry. Nice glimpse of WW II naval history though."
5,A VERY ROMANTIC ALBUM,I DONT HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT THAT THE ALBUM LEFT ME SPEECH LESS THAT WAS HOW GOOD THE ALBUM WAS I REALLY LIKED THE VOCALS THEY PUT RIGHT BEATS WITH THEM AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT
2,not for walking around!,"Cute if you are standing still! Not a comfortable shoe; gaps around the sides of the sandal and is stiff. Cute design, but looks a bit cheap"
3,high arches only!,"Great looking sandal. Cushioned, pretty, well made. Unfortunately the straps are set quite high and were too loose for my foot. A person with high arches could probably wear this shoe."
3,Kenneth Cole Reaction Women's Calzone Wedge,"I purchased the black wedges. I was very disappointed when I received them because they were way too long. I wear a 8 1/2 in heels/sandals. Rarely do I have problems with buying shoes online. But, these run big. I'm bummed that I now have to pay return shipping. Although these are very pretty shoes, I'm not sure if I will re-order the smaller size."
1,Not worth it!,It looks pretty and comfy too. But it's not worthy to waste money on this because it broke after a couple of use.
2,Quality not so good,I used it only once and its interior surface has discolored already . Not recommended
5,Great pan,I've used the pan twice to fry eggs at 7 setting on jenn aire and it performed well. It heated quickly and it washed easily with no discoloration.
1,This is worse than my frying pan from the dollar store,"No matter how much oil/butter/lard and all the different heat ranges you try, and after following all the advice given by other reviewers..everything will stick to this pan.Eggs seem to stick the most.Unbelievable..."
3,General Comment About Omelet Pans,"to make the best omelets, w/o sticking, you should use the pan *only* for omelets, and never wash it. just wipe it out w/ a paper towel, unless you've burned something that is stuck to it (which can sometimes be removed by rubbing it with salt). the pan should also be ""seasoned"" before first use by heating some oil in it and letting it cool before removing the oil. when making an omelet, you should use a little more butter/oil than you would with a ""non-stick"" pan."
2,Very rough inside surface,"The inside surface of this pan is very rough compared to my 12"" Calphalon pan. Also, it is lighter than the product page states (2.5 lbs. in reality compared to 3.1 lbs. stated on the product page). Other things: The handle is too skinny and hard to hold (again compared to the 12"" pan), and the 10"" Calphalon glass lid does not fit."
5,No regrets,"Being the frugal type, I wondered if I should spend top dollar on cookware. I have always either bought cheap cookware, or relied on the kindness of others for hand me downs. I'm happy to say I have had no buyer's remorse with the Calphalon cookware. The pan heats quickly and evenly, which is a plus when using an electric stovetop. No problems with clean up, either."
2,Not as good as what Calphalon supposes to be,"I just bought my few days ago from Bed Bath & Beyond since I had a 20% off coupon. I was very disappointed after I removed the wrap completely. First, I noticed that the area where the handle attached to the pan, above the logo is not polished. Then after my first use, the interior became discolored. Also, the handle is awfully thin that really hurt my hands while holding it. In addition, it get scrached easily. So... why am I spending extra money buying Calphelon???? For those reviewers who praised about their Calphelon, they probably bought theirs few years ago. Now, some (or most) of their products are made in China and the quality is just not as good as it used to be. So...if you see a really good deal, check up where it made from. 99% of time will be China, then... think twice before you buy."
2,Sticks and hard to clean,"I have pots in the Calphalon Triply Stainless Steel and love them. I order the omelet pan thinking it would be the same. Even with using olive oil, butter or spray, everything sticks. On top of that, it's also difficult to get clean. After three soakings, there was still a small amount of scrambled egg residue which shouldn't be that hard to get off. I think in the future, I will continue to buy the Caphalon non stick pans even though I prefer the stainless steel for my pots."
1,Never even came close,"I've tried every combination and technique in this book, with not even an 8 dollars win. Then i stopped using the book and started picking quick picks,and did a lot better than with these tables and methods. Save your money for quick picks"
1,...,I purchased the book and found very little information that was not already listed for free.400 pages of wheels and formulas is just filler. It talks alot about great things listed in other books but gives no meat.
3,"Haven't had much ""smart"" luck with it","Although I've been using this book along with the Lottery Master Guide for about 3 months, I've only won $17 most times. I'm starting to think that if you are lucky you will win lottery prizes with or without applying these handicapping strategies. If good luck hasn't manifested itself in your life prior to buying these books, it might not choose this time to start."
5,buried treasure,"I consider this album the ""Pet Sounds"" or ""Revolver"" of Jimmy Webb's solo efforts. This beautiful compilation of deeply personal, moving songs is at once spirited, mournful and soaring in its scope. The inspirational orchestration is lush in a gleefully, indulgent way...check it out. This album, now difficult to acquire, never received the recognition it deserved and provides a rare glimpse of the man who wrote, MacArthur Park, Up, Up and Away, All I Know, By the Time I Get to Phoenix and dozens of other timeless pop classics."
4,good glasses,"Their strong and big. I like them alot. Their very practical and serve the purpose. If you like to stay put with a full glass, its a great buy."
5,Satisfied,"I was pleased to receive exactly what I paid for, and I received it within the time I was promised to receive the item."
3,Bio lab,I liked the atlas however several of the pictures were not the same as those used in class by audio or physical reference
5,Awesome book,"This book is amazing, you will got what you need for biology courses not only in university but also in colleges."
5,Extremely Helpful!,"I am in 2nd semester freshman majors biology lab and our professor basically said that if we wanted an A we needed this book. He was right! It's amazing. The pictures and details blow me away... it's like having the specimen right there in front of you! It makes studying for the tests not necessarily EASY, but definitely easier! Also, I got the loose-leaf copy instead of the bound and it was probably half the price. I just put it in the binder I already had for biology."
3,A little out of date...,"This atlas is a good source for information, but it is a little out of date.. there are better editions with colored pages that are more up to date with the classifications of the organisums."
1,The picture was black!,Showed up bright green! not happy....the picture should match the product....too late to send back and get another in time for Xmas.....
4,Excellent for older children,"The other review is misleading, the marbles come as hard marbles, no papers or stickers involved at all. I bought a set for my daughter who is 7. She loves looking at them and researching which planet is which and understands the ""local universe"" now. We bought the 6 marble set with the large universe marble. It is high quality and a worth-while present for older children."
3,Not the Best Quality for the Price,"Although my son might disagree with me, this set is not all it's cracked up to be. For the price, you get 6 marbles: Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, moon, and a 'galaxy' marble. They are okay but the finish seems more of a paint job then true glass colors. There are imperfections in many places (not including the 'topographically correct earth) which is really just topographically correct by colors not texture. Another reviewer talked about the sticky stuff on their marbles, ours had it too. It was easy enough to wipe off and my son equated it to the sticky stuff that holds cards into magazines.It comes with a carry bag and two 'display stands' which are really just metal washers.They just seem like a lot of money for a small set of lower quality marbles."
2,Not to scale,"Although I haven't actually bought this, I wanted to warn buyers that these are not actually to scale as the description says. Specifically, the Earth marble is smaller than both the Venus and Mars marbles, when in reality Venus is a bit smaller than Earth, and Mars is much smaller. Anyway, if you're picky about these things like me, it's something you should know. This set (Earth, Mars, Moon To Scale Marble Box Set) with just Earth, the Moon and Mars is a bit more accurate. So there's my nitpicky review."
4,beautiful marbles,"These planet marbles are beautiful and nice to display, but they don't get played with very often. I'd say they are better for looking and learning than actual play, but cool none the less."
2,Charger,The time is not compatible with my camcoder. I am planning to return the product to get the right one.
4,Fast Delivery-Good working product,"The adapter is smaller in size than the original and fits better in our camera case, but works just as well. I had been hesitant to order it, since the price was quite a bit lower than purchasing it directly from Sony, but there appears no difference in the product. It works great!"
5,exactly as advertised,"Performs exactly as advertised, allowing you to charge the battery without removing it, and run the camera without draining the battery."
2,Not quite the Sony,"This Sony AC adapter has two parts: one part has the powerpack (the blackbox), the other part is a wire that plugs into the powerpack. The powerpack is by Sony, as advertised. However the wire is NOT the wire that Sony provides. The Sony wire has one squared prong, which fits into the squared hole on the powerpack. This wire does has two round prongs, not a squared prong. Probably still works, but NOT AS ADVERTISED. When I order a Sony product, I expect the Sony product!"
2,Not satisfied.,I was expecting a Sony product but received an aftermarket product labeled Wasabi Power with a part number of AC-L25. I am part to blame for my dissatisfaction by not looking at ALL the pictures and reading ALL the reviews to learn that this was not a Sony produced product. After I received the item today I scoured the item page for some type of documentation that I was not actually purchasing a Sony product even though the item description clearly states it to be a Sony product. Not happy and have not decided whether to return it or try it out.
4,just in time,"I had lost my adapter, couldn't find it anywhere in walk-in stores, went to amazon.com found it and they had it to me in two days, just in time for my grandson's kindergarden graduation. Thank you Amazon.com!"
1,simply good luck,"i ordered this thinking it would work, boy was i wrong. Just because of this now, I'm not sure if i should buy anything else."
1,Did not work for my camera,"I have a Sony NXCAM and it was a gamble going for this smaller charger. The model of batteries I have are Sony NP-FV70. I lost the original cord (left it in hotel) so needed a replacement. As advertised, this charger did fit the camera. It does turn the light on and it has the appearance of charging the battery. That said, it does absolutely nothing to charge the battery.I had hoped that at the very least it would power the camera while plugged in until I could find another solution, but as soon as the battery died the camera shut down... even when plugged in.I ended up buying a Bower Universal Charger at Frys and it works perfect. It came with wall charger and car charger accessories and fits not only the battery for the NXCAM, but also smaller batteries for my Canon. Only downside is it has no ability to plug directly into the camera but I just keep my batteries charged and I'm good to go."
2,Not worth spending the extra money,"In Dec. 2011 I purchased this Sony AC-L200 adapter thinking I would pay the extra money to get a name brand (Sony) product vs. the cheaper no name brand. I have used it maybe 10 times and it's been less than a year. About the 6th time I used it to charge my camera battery, the cord had become seperated from the end with the two circular prongs that plug into the black box part. I put black tape on it to hold the two together because you could see bare wires. I had used it a few times since but have to wiggle it to keep it charging until today when it wouldn't do anything. So I wouldn't suggest buying this product at all- after reading other posts buyer beware, not even sure it's actually a real SONY product."
1,Sony AC-L200C Adapter,Beware of buying this product. It doesn't work with my Sony DH Camcorder. This is an imitation that is very light and has no charging effect.
1,"Not bad enough to be funny, just bad","My wife and I love funny-bad bimbo movies. Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is one of our favorites, and we love anything by Andy Sidaris.This one just reaks. The dialog is flat and the people don't look like they had fun making it. Rent it, don't buy it. Yech."
1,Assault of the Killer Bimbos,"A mildly entertaining bit of fluff that almost has enough story to carry off its purpose -- to show three beautiful women. Unfortunately, the acting and sets are terrible. It's the type of movie adolescent boys from the early 1960's watched to get their thrills."
2,Assault is right!,"Assault on my brain! I kept waiting for it to get better, it didn't! A sure cure for insomnia, a real snoozer!"
2,Is it really a parody?,"This film was disappoitingly not funny, to the point I found myself asking whether it was really a parody of a B-movie or was it actually attempting to be serious... The jokes were just not funny (were they trying to make jokes?)."
2,BH100 could be better,"I am tempted to just write ""You can do better than this item"" but this probably would not be very useful even though I don't even know if this is still sold.1. Very very slow load times2. No java menu support for HD-DVD's (who cares now really)3. It leaves one wondering if there is something wrong or is it really supposed to act this way."
3,Sting Bluray Berlin,"Re Sting Berlin Concert. I was rather disappointed with the audio quality of thisrecording and to some extent the video as well. Sting's microphone system was distortedand sibilant,the mixing was such that individual instruments were not audible at timesand overall the audio was muddy. The performance was professional as you would expectfrom Sting, and the orchestra got quite involved which was quite entertaining. It isunfortunate that the Bluray's inherent quality was not exploited properly. I enjoyed inparticular 'Russians' and 'Desert Rose'. In fact I have purchased Prokfiev's 'Romeo and Juliet""ballet on the strength of the arrangement of 'Russians'.Again, Amazon's service was up to the usual excellence.Regards,Builderbob."
2,You have to be a die-hard Sting fan and even then . . .,"this concert may not be your cup of tea. The arrangements for this performance are very different and, in my opinion, Sting leaves out some of his records. This is not your ordinary Sting concert. Buyer beware."
2,Sting Live in Berlin,"I love Sting The Musician but not Sting The Singer. In this bluray product, he used the full orchestra to back his solo singing performance and I think it overloaded the audience's welcome of Sting.It could be better if Sting infused into his program other singers to keep the show fresh and alive. Because,let face it,his voice lacks the necessary dynamic of a great singer, and after three songs, we were craving for a new face, a new voice, just anything for variety, but he kept on singing songs after songs. I could not take it any more and had to turned the bluray off before the end...A big waste with the full wonderful orchestra.I wish Sting should focus more on his music playing, arranging, composing instead of his singing."
3,Poor Audio,"Nice addition to your Sting library, good picture, but unless you absolutely have to have ALL Sting releases, this one just does not make the grade for a Bly-ray disc. Orchestra - 5 stars, performance & presentation by Sting - 4 stars (maybe). Material selection - 3 stars. Audio mix (5.1, really???) - 1 star, in other words, bad. Even worse with headphones mixed down to 2 channels. I like the CD much better, have not seen/heard the DVD."
4,no cd in blue ray version,"My only complaint is the blue ray version doesnt include a cd...the concert itself is really well done...no fancy editing, no obligatory shots of people in the audience mouthing the lyrics...a very nicely paced, extremely professional job."
3,Poor Sound,"Just like other reviews, poor sound no matter how you set up your audio system.I love Sting, this should have sound like nothing else.Very dissaponted on sound quality, video is almost perfect.EDIT 03/2012: Some months after and after changing my Denon amp settings, I got it where it should have been from the begining."
5,Sting en Blu ray es lo mejor!!,"Estuvimos en el espectáculo que Sting dio en el Festival de Viña de Chile en 2011... este disco fue parte del regalo del día del padre y definitivamente no nos equivocamos al escogerlo! la definición de audio e imagen espectacular, simplemente crees que estás frente a él en el concierto.Totalmente recomendable!"
3,Why no DVD,"I just wanted to point out how utterly ridiculous it is that this is not available on standard DVD.Many music lovers (myself included) would love to have this concert, but do not have a Blu Ray player nor plan to get one.In fact, I would guess that only a very tiny percentage of potential viewers have Blu Ray."
2,Don't waste your money,Pretty typical strip format with each girl taking turn showing you her bits and pieces. Pretty boring stuff. The girls are not all that wonderful and silicone implants abound.
1,"Very, very disappointing!","I don't understand this product, the picture and description clearly shows a bottle with a sprout pourer, yet I only received the bottle without the sprout!Careful how you go about ordering this."
3,oil bottle,Just received this bottle and right outof the box I noticed a crack in center edge.I know I should of returned it but it was not worth the hassle.I know that I lost money on this but I will never buy anotherone from them because they should've had better quality control.Only good thing was that it was an inexpensive bottle.
2,Only for serious collectors-Not for reading pleasure,"I only reccomend this book to collectors who want to have all of the ""Return To Oz"" movie books. It is not a book that is very well written, and it's obvious that the author was had limited pages to use, because lots of details are left out. It is very poorly written. The only good thing is the illistrations. I would only buy this if you were just DESPERATE to have it. It's a good thing I only spent a matter of dollars on it, or it would have been a waste!"
2,Very cheap looking toy. Not liking it at all.,Definitely not worth $19.99 (regular retail price). I purchased it on sale and I still think it's not worth the price I paid for it. It's very cheaply made (even the box it came in). Looks like something that could be purchased at a dollar store or convenience store. I have other toys from Keenway and I was very disappointed that this one wasn't up to the other standards.
3,Going to read it again,"This is an excellent book! It usually takes me a couple of weeks to read a book because I pick up it and then put it down and pick it up again in a few days. But this book, I read it in 3 days! Great book..I will be reading it AGAIN! Cant wait for the next book!"
5,Loved It!,I loved sooner or later. As soon as I received a copy I finished it in 2 days! It was well put together and the chemistry between the characters in the book were fantastic. The only complaint I have is that it was not long enough. I love to read and wish that I was still reading this novel.
1,Very outdated,"I realize that it is impossible to keep a travel guide up to date and current with changes that occur in the hotel and restaurant industries, but this book is very outdated. Despite being published three years ago, it features places that have been closed five-seven years. Apparently, no follow-up research was done in publishing this second edition.I was very disappointed with this purchase."
3,furniture doesn't fit,"this is a fun enough dollhouse and it has loads of furniture and my daughter likes it. i am annoyed with it though, because the furniture doesn't fit and the bed constantly falls out. also, the people don't sit well on the chairs or couch, which is a bummer. it is cute and folds up well though."
4,Practical Guide,"This is one reference book that has only one purpose in mind. And the author does the job in readable, practical detail, giving us star ratings and descriptions of various nude scenes. Unlike the 1996 edition, this one only has information on actresses. This is no intellectual guide for movie buffs, but it's quite useful for those with an eye on actresses in the buff."
3,"Decent enough, but not the ultimate","This book is a good alternative to Mr. Skin's Skincyclopedia, but alas, is still not as complete as Mr. Skin's website. Therein is a very complete, and constantly updated database of nudes throughout film history. For a fee, you can even see videoclips and still photos of all there is to see. Okay book.Great site. Go there now!Walt D in LV"
5,Very Exciting Story,"This is one of Mason's best.The storyline was awesome and built to a high point as it progressed.........The hero,sexy,brave and tough as nails made this one wonderful book to read."
4,A classic romance,I enjoyed this story. The characters were believable and had depth. The storyline was well thought out. Worth the purchase.
4,Family betrayal and infidelity...at it's finest,"I have read several of Connie Mason's books and have yet to be disappointed. From historical westerns to historical medievals they are all addicting. I guess we all crave the dangerous liasons of a steamy romance and this book doesn't let us down. Medieval romance at its finest with love, hate and turmoil. Steamy ... sparks fly when Drake and Raven meet again after many years. Dreamy castles with cliffs overlooking the sea and making love in open fields and fresh water creeks add to the scene of betrayal that turns into love everlasting."
5,Opinion,"I thought this was a great story....but it was so much like Connie's ""Lord of the Night"" I was a little disappointed. Plots very much the same. Good guy, bad guy, damsel in distress. Lots about virinity and losing it. I think it is well worth the read but not right after you read ""Lord of the Night"". I really enjoyed Connie's ""The Rogue and the Hellion"". I plan on reading most of her entire collection. I really like the way she has steamy ""love"" scenes and gives location and time of setting right in the beginning of her books. Connie-if you read this please do more midevals!Thanks,Ali"
3,It is Ok... Mason could have done better,"It was a good book I suppouse, I found it a bit odd though how Drake seemed to forgive her so easily for ""Destroying his dreams with Daria"" and then after that Raven wrote a letter so that he wouldn't follow her when they became lovers so that Waldo wouldn't hurt him, he found it and was angered... but then about 7 pages later things are back to normal..."
3,Not my cup of tea but not bad,"Honestly, I didn't finish reading the book. It's not that it was bad but the emotions and basics of the relationship were pretty much resolved long before the end of the book and the rest was just finding a legal way to be together and other loose ends that held no interest for me. For me, once all emotional and intimate issues are resolved and if the story itself is not truly gripping, I end it."
4,The Original Rapid Prototyping Text,"This book is widely considered to be the original rapid prototyping text for the relatively young RP industry. Charles Hull, Dr. Jacobs, and the other authors do a good job taking the reader through the developmental stages of Stereolithography and give valuable insight into the system design and process development of the SLA system. Other highlights include an informative chapter on SLA part accuracy, specific case studies from early users of the technology, and decent coverage of competing technologies.(circa 1991)Some of the information is outdated due to the developments in RP over the past nine years, but it is still a valuable reference tool for any student of the rapid prototyping industry."
3,Kindle version is riddled with misspellings and typos.,I didn't enjoy this book as much as other James Carlos Blake novels I've read. The kindle version has an annoying typo or misspelling every few pages. The descriptions of the Everglades in those days were the high points for me. Three stars.
3,"I like it, but too small!","I'm pleased with how it cooks, but is smaller than expected. The overall dimensions are deceiving, as I thought the cooking area would be the same as the outer -- it isn't. I already have a Foreman grill with the same dimensions as this one, but with much more cooking room. A little disappointing. The cooking area is good for 1, possibly 2 people. The only reason I ordered this was for the removable grills. I'm hesitantly keeping it. I'll know the next time to be more cautious with sizing."
2,nice watch.. but dead battery...,"To much trouble to send back, but arrived with a dead battery.Ended up getting another gift and still carry watch around in trunk to get a battery put in it. Watch looks nice - but it would be nice if it worked."
4,"Great watch, but not a kid's watch","This is a great watch for a woman, but not for a child. This watch is made to fit an adult wrist and is clearly intended for a woman. Keep this in mind when looking for kids gifts. The Disney Kids in the discription is misleading. It's fun, cute, and stylish (for a woman)."
3,Watch great - battery DOA,I bought the watch for my daughter; she was so thrilled with it. It was perfect - in looks. The battery was dead and she couldn't wear it until I took it in and got a new battery. This would have been a 5 star review if the watch had been in working condition.
3,"Nice watch, but watch who you give it to!","So far, this has been a quality watch. It seems to work just fine, the only problem is that how suitable is it for the lady in your life you might think of giving it to. I thought it was cute and presentable, but my friend's daughter's mother thought it was a little out of line. I guess you don't want a lady who would wear such a title (""flirt"") even on her wrist. If you just need a watch to tell the time, this is great, but ""watch"" where you wear it. I'm actually suprised that the Disney company would put out something that teeters on innappropriate like this."
2,"I adore Kodo, but this is more Techno than Taiko","I will say this: Kodo has taken an unprecedented step in allowing their music to be stretched, folded, and tweaked to the limits by some very talented DJs. I applaud their innovation. However, this is not for someone who dislikes Techno/House music. If you enjoy Kodo and Taiko drumming, you may still not enjoy this CD. I would recommend listening to the samples that are available on Amazon.com first. There are Taiko ""chunks"" and ""flavors"" throughout the CD, but I feel that it any percussion played by some very talented artists could have provided that same material. This is a **Techno** CD that's different from other Techno CDs, not a **Taiko** CD that's different from other Taiko CDs."
1,Know what Remix means,"I wish I had been able to read the reviews or to have been able to sample this CD before purchasing. The power and purity of Kodo drumming has been perverted with electronics that have little if anything to do with the music. Some of the tracks are so ""remixed"" as to mask totally the original work. If you like Kodo type drumming, avoid this CD totally."
2,Oy! Not What I expected,"What can I say....I love Kodo. But this was not Kodo. While I'm sure the remixer's, DJ's, Et`al, might have meant well...What they did to this album is a grave injustice to Kodo. The tracks were so remixed, distorted, folded, bent, stapled, and mutilated. That I thought the Postal Service had gone into the Music Recording Industry to supplement their profits... I couldn't tell if most of the tracks were based on Kodo's works or not for the most part... Next time Kodo allows remixers to use their works. They should definitely put it in the contract someplace. That the tracks should at least resemble their original compositions in a more identifiable fashion. I love techno as much as the next person, but this was even beyond my tolerance...Guess I'm just a purest at heart, when it comes to Kodo and their style of Tiako."
5,Just Ordered Another,"This thing works great. Solid design (metal construction) and relatively uncomplicated. Does what it says it does. I give it five stars.I purchased a different branded sprinkler at a local lawn and garden store, and it worked for two whole days, so beware of the junk out there."
4,The world must know who Palestinians are !,"The author writes his experience as a Palestinian refugee, gives the reader an idea of how Palestinians have been through numerous problems and crisis ever since their exodus from THEIR land in 1948 by the Zionists. He also gives a true picture of the Arab situation, how weak it is, and how Arabs even were against Palestinians themselves. The book is unique since the author combines some of his personal experience with stories, political history, and review. It's a must-read book, gives a clear picture to those who really want to know more about the issue in the Middle East."
5,An astonishing look at the Native American Sioux,"This documentary makes a powerful statement about hope and will inspire anyone who has faced discrimination and despair. Indian activist and actor Russell Mean's statements about 911 and the Twin Towers are shocking and disturbing, but his belief in the culture of the Lakota (Sioux) is powerful and moving. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is like a third world country in many respects and watching this film gives you the sense of the desolation and isolation people living there must feel. It almost can be viewed as a mirror of what life could be like for many of us in the future as baby boomers age and the entitlement programs collapse. This film is a warning as a well as a statement of hope. What can we learn from the Sioux? I've been asking myself that question since I first watched this remarkable movie."
2,Bad movie.,"I ordered this for research. It was not particularly helpful. It did show some of both sides to challenges on the rez, but was over all not worth the time and money. I am donating it to the library so the next person doesn't spend any $."
3,Androcentric,"This work speaks about a lot of issues hurting the Lakota Nation. Those who live nowhere near a reservation will be highly informed by the topics presented. I applaud this effort. However, the work was strikingly andrcentric. The grand majority of interviewees were men. Even when women spoke, they were only on screen a fraction of time compared to the men. Author and activist Paula Gunn Allen once wrote that focusing on Native women, and not just Native men, opens doors to new possibilities. Her ideas were not practiced here at all. Near the end of the work, Means stated that the classical Lakota society was matriarchal. Well, you wouldn't know that by what's presented here. I think pro-feminist viewers may be disappointed in this one regard when watching this laudable work."
1,Yep Talking Heads!,"I didn't really believe one reviewer who commented it was like watching talking heads. Surely they exaggerated! But, to my profound disappointment, it was true. Very little in the way of illustrative footage, mostly cameras focused on people talking about issues. Very disappointing, and the waste of an opportunity to illustrate life on Pine Ridge, and what happens when the good things of a culture are completely decimated, and replaced with garbage, all in the name of ""civilizing"" a people in our own image."
4,You Done Good Donald!,"When it comes to donald Lawrence's music, it's either hit or miss with me. Well...this album was Hit with a capital H. I love his newer songs and the fact that he blended them with the old ones. You have to hear Finale Act I as well, their twins. I love Matthew 28, Giants, Encourage Yourself ( At first I thought it was Sheri, from Ted & Sheri). He difinitely went out with a bang on this one! Buy it!"
4,Well pleased!,"I purchased this CD b/c I liked the song ""Encourage Yourself""...however, this project was very uplifting. In fact, I didn't realize that this same group also sung It's your Time. I keep these two songs on repeat."
2,This Game Inspired me to go into Video Game Reviewing,"This one of the most frustrating games of all time. For one thing you have a better chance catching a one armed pass over a regular two hand catch wtf kind of since does that make. Your players get injured by just running, its immaculate hard to get a sack on there, you can't ever predict when you are going to get a pick on there. Its definitely the most frustrating football game of all time. I started my own video game reviews, and this was the first game that I reviewed."
5,Scriptural Novel,"As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and an avid reader of both novels and scripture, I was truly amazed at the historical and scriptural integrity in this fictional account of the Nephites and Lamanites. It made me want to re-acquaint myself with The Book of Mormon people and their arduous spiritual journey."
5,How much fun is Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga,"This review is going to be sweat and very short, since I am very busy today with college work at Ashford Universityonline. This game is well worth the money that you will pay for it. You will definitely spend many hours playing this game. I have not played this game on all the difficult levels, but it is even challenging on the easy difficult level. Hope whoever buys this game will give me a good rating on my short review of the game. Goodbye everyone, I am pressed for time. See you all later!Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds (Mac)"
4,Nostalgia!,"I owned this game back when it first came out. I really enjoyed it when I first had it, and I spent more time on this game than probably any other game I ever owned. It was addictive. Now that it's been several years since its release, I still have the same feelings about it! As soon as I started playing it again, I was just as excited as when I first picked it up! I definitely recommend this game to other Galactic Battlegrounds veterans as well as any other Star Wars or RTS fans. It's graphics don't beat today's best RTS graphics, but it makes up for that in fun!"
2,Disappointing,"I love RTS games and i love Star Wars but i did not care for this game. After reading nothing but positive reviews i totally had to buy this game. Little did i know that i would be bored with it after the first day. The next few days i would pop the CD back in the drive and give it another chance, but it is simply boring."
3,Dumb,"Although it is sort of fun, i'd only reccomend it for a 10 year old relation who loves star wars. As other people were saying, yes, this is an exact copy off AOK (Age of Kings. I can even relate a few civies, i.e Trade Federation=Huns. I play this game when im bored and want some strategy gaming, but with AOC (Age of Conquorers, AOK's expansion) for that, this game has stayed on the shelf for many a year. If you need a good futuristic RTS game, your better off with Homeworld or Starcraft."
2,AOK Is Better,"I got this game and I have to ask... WHAT THE HECK??????? This is simply a unit modification for ""Age Of Kings"". They only changed some graphics,and sounds and released it as a new game.Don't even bother buying it if you own AOK (or try the Trial Version first)"
1,This game is so bad!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is so sucky!!! The units are almost the same and the graphics are not good! The multiplayer is all right but it takes ages to finish! I recommend Warcraft 3 folks. Do NOT buy this game
1,Love Star Wars... Hate Lucas arts games,"I heard of this game and I thought it would be the greatest thing I have ever played. I always wanted a Star Wars strategy game being able to crush the filthy rebels with your imperial army. But I went to the web site I looked at screenshots, played the demo and man this game sucks balls. The graphics suck tremendously and I don't like how they created so many new vehicles and people that aren't really to interesting. If you want to play a decent star wars game get Star Wars Force Commander its not the greatest but its allot better than this game. I swear Microsoft or someone needs to start making Star Wars games, LUCAS ARTS SUCKS."
3,Age of Empires replaced by star wars,"I like the game, but it is exactly like age of empires, i mean you can even que up farms to built, One of the cooler things things is you can train a sith lord or jedi master, thats pretty cool, but other than that, every aspect is identical to age of empires, aoe is better, this is just a copy. The game is built on the age of empires engine, just wish they would have made some changes, its fun to play, but when your playing, i find myself thinking is this aoe?"
4,puzzled,"I bought this from Amazon for a Christmas gift. When it came the box was slightly crushed and 2 of the containers of crystals were open and they were all over the place. I tried to re-assembel them but the crystals were all mixed up, I could not give it as a gift and decided to keep it. The enclosed pamphlet said you could order more crystals. I sent in my order but is was returned. Now it will be useless once I run out of crystals."
1,It's old,"I have been using vet wrap for years. Don't order it from Amazon's source. I know old vet wrap when I see it and what I receive from Amazon is old and consequently hard to use. It hard to unwrap. It's the real 3M stuff but it you need to get it fresh. After a year or two, it's magic fades."
1,Color in picture is misleading,"I ordered red. The color I received is NOT red, it's sort of a reddish-pink. A friend gave me part of a roll she bought some time ago, which was a true red."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!,"Buyer beware indeed. This is a complete waste of time. Of the 9 tracks, only one(!) 'Slow Motion' actually features the Sweet singer Brian Connolly- the rest feature the similarly named 60's pop singer Brian Connell and his band the Round Sound. Sweet afficiandos advise you all to give this release a BIG miss."
4,An in depth study of the Tonfa,"This book covers all main aspects of the tonfa, from the basic strikes to its modern use in America as the PR24. It contains two kata, Pinan Yondan and the legendary Hama Higa no Tonfa which are well illustrated and easy to follow. Also, the two kumite (Tonfa vs.Bo & Tonfa vs. Tonfa) are extremely useful in taking the practitioner to the level of actually applying the tonfa to realistic situations. I would disagree with the review below which states that this book has everything one needs to know (ie.all kata etc) about the tonfa. This is not the most advanced level of tonfajutsu, but it will test a tonfa pratitioner's ability and is most certainly an essential book to add to one's tonfa practice."
3,"Good, but error-filled","This book is a good introduction to the tonfa, and the skills associated with it. It includes grips, blocks, strikes, katas, and defenses against various weapons. But the book was careless in detail. For example, of the 9 blocking position photos, 8 were mis-identified in the descriptions. The the main kata described (Hama Higa no Tonfa) includes 168 steps, but again the descriptions frequently don't line up with the photos, and the descriptions sometimes confuse left and right foot moves. A good book overall... but be prepared to interpret past the many mistakes."
5,The most advanced tonfa,"Not only a book, but a practical manual of all katas and positions offered by this increadible defense and attack weapon. If you're looking for a book where you can find both theory and practical contents, this is it! It has several examples of how to use a tonfa against sticks and other weapons alike. Incredible!"
1,Jeers for Eyewitness - Amphibian,"This disappointing video is not suitable for children, for it includes several scenes of terrifying witches chanting over cauldrons, as well as shots of the vampire in Nosferatu. How such scenes are supposed to educate anyone about amphibians is beyond me. In general, the eyewitness series seems to be more flash than substance, with a style that both reflects and contributes to the public's declining attention span and desire for video-game excitement."
2,Not as shown,"The Mr. Coffee carafe was configured with the pour spout in the wrong place. It should be on the side but this item had the spout at the opposite end of the handle. Not very convenient to pour and was not as shown in the picture. I would not buy this item again and if another breaks, I will go to Walmart."
3,Resevoir Cap Discontinued,"I bought this model on sale quite a few years ago and used it for 4 or 5 years. It worked reasonably well in that time - not the best espresso I've ever had but ok for home. Eventually the cap over the water reservoir started to leak steam. It still worked but I didn't know if it was safe or effective so I've retired it. I was about to throw it away but tried first to see if a replacement cap was available. That part has been discontinued. Consequently, I can not recommend this product.This ""replacement parts"" website is pretty cool though:[...]"
5,Thank you!,I could not find a replacement for my cap/frap machine any where. This got here quickly and works perfectly. I am actually thinking of ordering a second for back up.
4,It does the job,This is the 2nd time I've ordered this because I keep breaking them in my stupid ceramic sink when I do dishes. I wish they came in plastic.But anyways it works perfectly!
4,Just what we needed,This fit our machine perfectly and we can once again make our morning mochas! I'm so glad this item was available.
3,NOT The Very Best Of ...,"This Very Best Of The Human League seems to be missing several hit songs. They are ""The Things That Dreams Are Made Of"", ""I Love You Too Much"", ""Hard Times"", and ""Love is All that Matters"". I cannot comment on the quality of this CD, since I would not buy it without those songs.The Human League has recorded many great songs, I would recommend their double CD combination ""Dare!/Love and Dancing"" (1981) for the main core of their greatest songs. Also the FASCINATION EP (1981) is a six song delight. There are many Human League Greatest Hits CDs to choose from to get the remaining great songs from their later issues.If you already have the above songs, then this Greatest Hits CD is as good as others. But I think you should compare them all for the best song selection. Good Luck, the songs are worth the search."
4,Good but.....,"So most of the ""hits"" are on here but why include of Phil Oakley's solo hits with Moroder ""Together In Electric Dreams"" but leaving off ""Goodbye Bad Times""... I'll never understand record labels!"
4,"There's more to Human League than ""Human"" and ""Don't You Want Me""","While I am not sure if I would say this album HAS to be be a definite part of your collection, even if you are an eighties child, I must say it showed me that there's more to The Human League than the classics they became most famous for: ""Don't You Want Me"" and ""Human"". There's a handful of other tracks in here (most of them already mentioned by other reviewers) worth checking out, but most of them don't size up to the level of ""classic"" that their most famous ones have reached. Overall, this compilation highlights the nice labor of a synth-based pop band that left their mark and will go down in musical history as one of the genre's pivotal acts."
5,Wonderful! Informative! A Great Read!,"This book was a fabulous read. Ms. Layne clearly illustrates the truth of the degraded status of women in Islam using as her primary source, the ""Quran"". Women are not elevated in Islam but rather are oppressed, emotionally and physically brutalized, and accused of being the reason for man's downfall. Islamic women are kept covered, silent, accused, separate from the world of men. The degradation of the female element in the islamic psyche and the islamic culture might very well be one of the major contributing factors in the violence and evil we see emanating from the ever-growing radical elements. I hope all muslim women read this book and open their eyes to the evil status this ""pseudo-religion"" has bestowed upon them"
5,He Never Fails,"Jones did a fantastic job with this new book. A contemporary Romeo and Juliet story about a young couple in the ghetto who falls victim to circumstances beyond their control. Despite all that, their love conquers all and they find happiness in the end. Who can't appreciate a good love story full of drama, crime, and redemption? If you have enjoyed his previous novels, you will certainly enjoy this one as well."
3,Okay,"I really like this author, so anything he writes I'm going to buy. But I read this book thinking it was so cliche. Everything was like something from a movie I'd seen a million times and even the supposed twists and turns were just like ""So What?"" But I got to the very last two pages and grinned from ear to ear. I've read better books by him, but I still think he did a pretty good job with this one besides it being so common."
3,It was just ok for me...,"Ride Or Die is a good, solid effort. It was a bit predictable in places and read more like an episode of a cop show than I would have liked but was still entertaining. I could see this on the big screen. There were times that I thought the story could have moved a little faster. The love between Jamal and Keisha was sweet but a little unbelievable in how it unfolded.I liked the ending and would even recommend this book to a friend but with the warning that you have to stick with it and don't give up on it."
5,Ride Or Die,"I've read alot of books, but this book is the best. I'm glad I was able to finally read a urban happily ever after story"
3,Disappointed,"This is the second book I've read by Mr. Jones and I expected more. The character development was really great and as usual he stuck to the ghetto in a way that if you didn't grow up in the ghetto you felt more in tune with it. This story seemed to be more for a younger audience. Even though I finished the book, I didn't do it within the usual time frame I could have because I was bored. I have yet to read Pipe Dream but I have high expectations for that one also."
1,Do not waste your money,"When I first read about this product I was very excited I notice that it was a little pricey but the ingredients was to die for. my first month I shedded more hair then every before, I then went back to there website and start to observer the small print, which says that u will shed hair first quote "" this means the product is working"" month later still shedding and ABSOLUTLY no hair growth. This product made alot of my hair shed off I didn't notice no regrowth. Please save your money."
2,Did not work for me,I followed all the instructions and nothing. I recommend Pravana Biojen9 products because they worked for me. The Revivogen was a waste of money for me.
5,Life goes on,Ive met James Prosser when he was in the Pine Mountain.He is a great singer and has talent that will take him far.And not to mention great looks but most of all he is a very nice man.Every time we went to the show he was so sweet and would take pictures with our family every year.My grandfather loves that and so do I. I wish him all the luck and I pray for his family.
3,"Very nice watch, but theres a downside","If you have any hair on your arms, this watch is going to tug and rip it right off. Its a great looking watch, shiny and very expensive looking."
2,Thought this was more traditional Italian Music,"There were no listening samples available on amazon so I went with all the reviews. I was looking for a traditional music cd that I could play in the background at my rehearsal, but these are more modern hits. Some are ok, but others have a little too much 80s feel."
1,? Customer Service,"The last CD in this set was not correct. When I asked to have it replaced they would only allow me to return it for a refund. I did not want to stand in line at the post office to return this product. I only wanted the correct CD that I ordered and paid for. They were rigid in their ""Customer Service"" stance. Inflexible and ""form-letter"" responses that did not really address my wishes. I will not be buying from them again, good luck if you choose to."
1,disappointed,"I ordered three different italian CD's, however I am dissappointed because the one is all Italian, I wanted the songs to be in English"
5,"If you liked ""Tennis Shoes"" you'll like this to.","This is a very good sequel to ""Tennis Shoes Among the Nephites"". Harry Hawkins, his sister, and Garth Plimpton have grown up. They are now attending BYU and are in the dating scene. When a Nephite from the past shows up, Harry has to slowly regain his memory of the events that happened to him so long ago. This Nephite is on a mission, he must regain and destroy an ancient sword that is cursed. Our three heros, along with Jim's new girlfriend, must figure out how to rely on the Lord, and each other if they want to succeed. Along the way there are many people (one also from the past) who are trying to gain power using the sword. I thought this was a very good book and would recommend it to anyone."
4,For America Fans,"America fans will love this release from Gerry Beckley. For those of us who thirst for that America sound, this is a real ""gift."" Good stuff! After two listen-throughs, I was hooked."
3,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,This information (no english subtitles on these dvds) is not listed in the Amazon product details but is very important to those Gabin fans who DO NOT speak french.
4,"Rock-esque, but all jazz","I read Ben Allison chose the trumpet / guitar front line because he wanted to rock on this CD. It's not a loud CD, but it has some intense parts. Steve Cardenas on guitar strums a lot of chods, which is unusual for non-Django Reinhardt jazz songs. Sometimes he'll state the melody in unison or harmony with the trumpet. Ron Horton on trumpet carries a lot of the melodic and solo load. This is the first thing I've heard him on (Ben Allison too, truth be told), and he's very good. The songs are mostly written by Ben Allison, and they have strong melodies. Jeff Ballard's playing is the best I've heard him do, compared to what I've heard with Rosenwinkel, Mehldau, and Redman. The mood of the CD is part intense and part melancholy, which I think is the CD's purpose as Ben Allison's view of things happening in the world. It's not a rock or fusion album, but it is informed by rock, and perhaps jazz fans who also like rock might appreciate it more than those jazz fans who don't."
1,What a piece of junk,"I used this twice. The second time when I pressed the clamp that holds it to my waistband and/or belt, it broke in my hand. I returned it. I would think Timex could do better."
1,Timex Disappointment,I thought that because it was a Timex product it would last forever. It only lasted approximately 2 weeks. I purchased the pedometer because it had a cover so the data be protected. I wore the Timex daily. It just stopped working. We tried replacing the battery--evidently that wasn't the problem because it still doesn't work. I am very disappointed.
5,Basic -- but that's why I love it!,"I love using a pedometer, especially when tracking my steps each day -- and trying to keep track if I can make it to 10,000 or more. I like this one because it closes and is straight forward. I don't need to know how fast I was talking (that's for the gym, or when I'm using my Runtracker GPS App on my phone), this is just for steps. I've been using this style for at least 4 years now (because of using it so much, or better yet -- abusing it, I've had to purchase more than one) and am happy that I can just jump on Amazon to order one."
1,Junk,"This pedometer was a piece of junk. It read totally different things. I walked 100 steps around the kitchen, and it read anything from 130 to 250 steps. I would never recommend it. I had an old pedometer that was given free at work and it was much, much better."
1,pedometer,"I purchased this pedometer and it has not worked correctly since the day I got it. It just shuts down for no reason. I walk about 15 minutes in the morning and it should be a little over a mile and the steps shoud be well over 2,000 and sometimes it will show something like 122 steps which isn't possible and other days it works fine. I have replaced the battery twice and the darn things just has a mind of its own. Not worth the money at all as it is not a very good pedometer."
1,Poor quality,I haven't had this item even a month and the hinge that holds the meter onto yourpocket broke off. I would not recommend as there is no fix.
3,Pedometer,Useful but I had to contact Timex for a replacement due to accuracy in using the product but I would purchase again when neded
1,"Don t Buy, simply does not work","I tried it and tested in the same walking way 2 times, 2 different results. I used it walking at home, just at home, and got several miles walked. Crazy. Simply don t buy because it don t work."
2,Pedometer,I bought 2 of these. I wish I would haved saved my money.I don't believe it is very accurate.
2,Doesn't work,"I received this item on time (that was good), but it doesn't work. I took it to CPAC, Chucky Cheese and a bunch of Baby Pageants and it didn't detect a single pedophile. Seemed to count my steps pretty good though, so I guess I'll keep it for that, but if you think you're gonna be able to find sex offenders with it, forget it."
1,Untrustworthy,This pedometer will for an unknown reason will occasionally run in reverse and start subtracting previously recorded steps. Wish we had not bought two of them
1,Skip this one,"Bought this locally, at EMS store. Battery died after 3 weeks. Fortunately, store took it back and credited my VISA card with no problem. This may be an inexpensive unit, but if the batteries cannot last a month, it will quickly cost more for batteries then it did for the original unit."
1,Not consistent,Does not consistently count the steps. Works sometimes & doesn't other times! I am not sure I would recommend this to anyone!
4,Timex T5E011 Digital Pedometer,I love this product although the spring has a tendency to break.I have ordered 3 of these within the past 2 years. It seems to last onlya year before the spring breaks but I keep ordering it because I like it.Timex needs to review the springs that are put in this pedometer sothat I do not have to order it so often; always within the one-year warranty period.Also the return procedure needs to be changed because it took about 8 weeks toreceive my replacement and I was charged $10 but Timex removed the charge
1,Doesn't work like I thought,I bought this item because I started a program that required to have a Pedometer. It did not record my steps as it should have. Very disappointed.
5,Pedometer,This pedometer is Great! Very easy to set up and very accurate. Perfect for checking steps at work and walking around the neighborhood.
2,Works only sporadically,"the Timex pedometer has mostly been a disappointment. it seemed to work fine for a few days, and then i noticed it stopped counting steps when it was clipped to my waitband. the only way it works now is if it's clipped to a lower pocket on my pants (at thigh level) or clipped to my socks. that's been a bummer, since sometimes i don't wear socks or have a low pocket on my pants."
1,Horrible,I bought this pedometer with great expectation because i wanted to know the distance and the calories burnt while walking. It arrived pretty soon so i was glad. But it never worked properly. After one hour walking it marked 24 steps and 9 calories burnt! Whaaaat? I followed all the instructions on how to set it up and looked for possible mistakes but i did everything ok and still not working correctly. Finally i attached to my shoe and it gave better numbers but different each day even though i was walking same path and same amount of time. Changed the battery but problem persistedI. Finally i gave up and threw it in the wastebasket. Only thing i like was the clip because it attached strongly and never fell or broke. A total waste of money. Will not recommend.
1,keeps breaking....not first one,"Originally I really liked this pedometer. I purchased it at a local sports store. It was ""taken"" from my office. I got another one and liked that one too....I lost that one and chalked it up to my carelessness. Purchased another. Kept it quite a long time. Fell in the snow....and lost it - who knows where in four feet of white.Got another...the clip on it broke. The store replaced it. (That was ten weeks ago) I lost that one in the park....clip seemed to be smaller, and I didn't like that...but maybe it's me. I had a broken leg and wasn't going anywhere for awhile. (remember my losing one in the snow?) Then I purchased this one on Amazon....it stopped working in days. The numbers disappear, the steps weren't accurate...it isn't something I'd invest in again .....Timex has gotten enough money from me. I should have stock. Except that if this trend continues...they won't be in this business anymore."
3,Sensitive to positioning,"This pedometer works pretty well if you can find the right place to put it. I found it to be very sensitive to even a one inch change it position, but when I got the position right it was accurate to within about 10%."
2,Didnt work?,"I purchased this product based on the TIMEX name. Appearance, wise, it seemed to be made with good quality and was easy to follow for it's use. Several ""tests"" proved to me that it was not counting. One walk of 20 solid steps counted 1. Another test counted 5...and so on. Sorry, I cannot recommend this one. I returned mine within two days of receiving."
3,Timex Pedometer,"This pedometer does what is supposed to do - keep track of one's daily walking mileage. However it suffers from a poor outward design. The latch to open the device, in order to check distance, is difficult to manage. It is hard to open once the device is attached to one's belt. It is primarily the design of the latch. In fact the latch looks more like a device to keep the unit intact. That is my only complaint"
5,IF I WERE OPRAH..THIS WOULD BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS!,"I DO NOT GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT THIS. IT MOTIVATES ME. I WALK THE 10,000 STEPS EVERYDAY. IF I DO NOT HAVE THIS WITH ME, MY DAY IS NOT THE SAME. TRY IT."
2,Annoyed...it broke,"I was annoyed because I assumed this would be a decent device. But only a couple days after getting it, the clip DID snap off. Hubby fashioned a new clip using velcro. But now it seems to never have turned off and the battery is dead.<sigh> Wouldn't it be nice if things worked long enough to get your money's worth."
4,Step counter---Timex T5E011,When I wear this device at the same time as an Omron H5-112 this device picks up about a thousand more steps during the day than the Omron. I do not know which is the most accurate.
2,Pedometer,"I was very disappointed, I was only able to use this product for a few days when it fell off and upon hitting the ground it broke. Needless to say I had to order a replacement. I purchased one that had a better grip on whatever it was clipped to. This one wasn't tight enough."
3,Timex pedometer,"This pedometer is very inconsistent. I walk a similar path every day, in various direction, about 2 miles. Some days it reads .67 miles and some it's 1.97. The instructions are to wear the device on your hip, and I do. My older pedometer just needed a battery. Lucky for me. I went back to the old one and the Timex will end up in a drawer."
5,Great little friend,"This is not a cheap plastic pedometer with a clip that will crack off easily. This pedometer is very light & sleek, unlike some I've had that were rather bulky. There is a nice large number display, easy to read. I figured a Timex would be a good brand for a pedometer. I am very satisfied."
4,Pedometer review,"Couldn't be simpler to use. Previous reviewer said you can't replace the batteries, but you can. Just read the instructions."
5,Great Phonics Lab center tool!,"Hello! I run a Phonics Lab with over 100 Kindergarten students. I bought several through Amazon, after seeing my twin grandsons enjoy it.. I use it as an activity in my classroom centers. Students are encouraged to say the word after making the word, then spell the word."
4,Great product,I love these made in America products from Melissa and Doug. I am using this with my 3 year old grandson and he responds well to them.
4,Fun and Educational,"I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter that is fascinated by numbers and letters right now. It's a great toy - good quality, good pictures, a lot of letters. The only problem I have with this product is that my daughter has noticed that there is no word in the set that uses the letter ""X"" and is very concerned about it. I do not know what to tell her and I can't fix the problem. I wish there was a way to buy more puzzle words to accompany the set. I really love Melissa & Doug products!!"
3,"Fun, but not for long","I got this for my oldest--not sure how old he was at the time. He started reading at 27 months. He loved this toy, and I loved how educational it was. It helped him learn how to spell those words. I'm pretty sure he already knew how to read all those words before he got the toy. He enjoyed sorting the letters (by letter and/or by color). It didn't take long at all for him to outgrow it, though. His younger siblings have hardly touched it--unless it's to dig through a pile of letters and spread them through the house."
4,Great for teaching basic words,This product is great to teach spelling and reading to young ones. The wooden boards and letters are very durable are easy to handle by small hands. The only downfall was that it does not come with a cover so the storage area for the letters is open. I am still trying to figure out what to do to keep the letters from getting lost without putting them in a separate place than the boards.
2,Disappointed in quality!,I purchased this as a replacement for the same exact product and was unpleasantly surprised when I opened it! YUCK! The older version had TEN boards rather than eight and a sliding plastic cover! Now the letters can just fall out and they replaced the 2 puzzle boards with styrofoam. The letters feel like a cheaper wood that could snap easier- which won't matter when they all get lost anyway! Really disappointed in the changes. Would NOT recommend you buy this new- find the older version!
1,Horrible quality. NOT what you'd expect from M&D!,"About a quarter of the wooden letters were not sanded down at all, had sharp strips of wood chipping off the back, or simply hadn't been cut out fully. We even received the tiny inner parts of some letters that were supposed to be discarded before packaged. Had I not been there with my daughter when she opened the toy she could have gotten some seriously nasty splinters."
3,Almost perfect,"Good quality puzzle. Three year old granddaughter loved it. Then she picked up the letter ""x"" and there was no word that used that letter. Or, W,Y,and Z. So, remove those letters, and no problems with the puzzle. However, the puzzle designer missed big time on this one. May return this one, and look for a puzzle that uses all the letters."
4,It's a good idea,"I liek the puzzles & the kids plat with it often - but I hate that the letters are covered with a lid or some type of plastic that snaps on. The letters are forever getting lost! Drives me crazy! And with a 2 & 4 year old I have a hard enough time trying to keep up with little toy pieces. I put it up now & when they want to play with it, I get it out, but then when they are done - it goes right back! But it's a good buy overall."
4,GREAT fun,My 1 and 2 year old daughters like this ... would like the letters a little more wood less cardboard
4,Spelling Bee fun,My son loves this wooden spelling template but i think the price is abit steep with only 16 templates.It seems like this is the only product that is worth getting in the market though.
5,True learning fun,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this... ""toy"". I love that it comes with 8 different boards each with a front and back (so you get 16 spelling puzzles in all). My daughter even likes to simply sort the letters on the floor and tell me what each one is or what sound each makes. The possibilities are numerous."
3,not all letters used,"just got this toy for my 2 year old son, he loves it but not all the letters are used to make words, his name begins with a ""j"" and he keeps trying to spell a word using the ""j"" but is disappointed every time. the designers should of thought of that in the production of this!"
2,Love Melissa & Doug toys but was disappointed in this one,I buy alot of Melissa & Doug toys. I was highly dissapointed in this one because when I received it the paint was chipped off half of the letters and the pictures were missing paint too. This is not one of there best products.
5,3 Year Old Loves It,This was purchased for a 2 3/4 year old boy. He finds it interesting and plays with it often. It does a nice job in helping to develop both motor skills and mental acuity.
4,wooden letter,"my grandson got one of these for christmas.. i think as he learns more about words and starts understanding about the written words more, he will enjoy them, and get more out of them."
5,great find and buy,another thing bought for my son and i must say it was a great learning experience and fun for the adults also.can be used for many things.
4,Great Toy for Preschoolers,My 4 year old loves spelling out words in this fun wooden puzzle. She knows all her ABC's but not yet her words so this is a great introduction! I love how there are more than enough letters to chose from. Only thing is 2 days after she received it some of the letters color started peeling off. I just glued it back but I'm sure over time they will mostly peel. You can still use them but instead of having fun colored letters it will all be wood. Toy is functional with or without color so it isnt a major problem. Each board has 2 sides so child can choose which one to do first.
3,Great Idea Poor Construction,"This toy is great and my 2 year old loves it, the only down side it that half of the letters came with the paint peeling off and there is no secure storage for the letters. Looks like a Zip-Lock bag will have to do. I love Melissa and Doug products so I was very surprised to see the low quality of this toy. Please fix ASAP!"
4,Great so far,"My daughter is JUST 3 so it's a bit early for this; she isn't drawn to it. But she starts pre-school this week, so I suspect she'll be working on it very soon! We also need to sit down with her more with this particular toy to DRAW her into it... Nice quality. Wish it had a lid!!"
4,good learning tool,Bought this for my almost 2 yr old granddaughter. She loves this form of learning and is getting to see lower case letters. My only recommendation would be for the game to come in a container so it can be closed and stored or carried w/you without dropping pieces. Also it would be nice to see some 'expansion packs' so you could buy additional boards with different words on them. Overall I would recommend this product.
2,Kinda Boring,"Love melissa and doug. quality is fantastic. My kid is a preschool who is like a sponge with word and sounds etc...Thought this would be the perfect little puzzle and she really was interested in it. All kids are different though so if you want somehting like this, the quality is great."
2,Not at all durable,Not impressed with this toy. Good concept very poor execution. We have owned this toy about two weeks. Specifically the top color laminate of the letters is falling off about 25% of the letters. The storage box is poorly made with cheap materials. I would not recommend this toy.
3,Educational but paint comes off!,"We bought several different Melissa and Doug toys and we love them but on all of them, only after a week of play, the paint is coming off various pieces. On the letters, I can already see white where the red paint used to be on this toy. I'm disappointed, however, I surmise given the lead-paint scare last year that perhaps the company switched paint products and they are just not as durable but safe. I still caution, as your child may end up putting paint chips in their mouth. Or getting it on their hands. I'm going to write to the company to ask about their lack of paint durability; as with three toys and only a week's worth of play I should expect better."
3,It's just ok.,"This toy is ok. The puzzles are fun, and my 4 year old enjoys them from time to time. It doesn't keep his attention very long. The part I don't like is the storage. The box the puzzles and letters come in is not very sturdy, and there is no lid over top of the letters. It would be nice to have a snap on cover so the letters would be easier to keep track of."
3,Nice Toy. Too many pieces with no lid for container.,My daughter loves puzzles and she enjoys doing these. What is unfortunate is that we cannot leave the set out that is easy for us without having to worry about her getting into it. Since this things has no lid we have to keep it out of reach lest she spill it when getting other toys or puzzles.The only thing I think this needs (as well as another M&D; toy I bought) I a lid to keep all the pieces together. A simple board that can slide into a groove would make this much better.
3,NEEDS A LID,The lack of a lid on this makes storage difficult without losing some of the letters. Overall it is ok.
4,High rating bc its unique to brand,"I don't want to bash the brand as I appreciate M&D puzzles but all the other wooden toys we have from them are not great. If I were to do it all over again, I'd definitely go with Plan Toys & Haba for the wooden food, etc. Okay, now on to this product, I went to Lakeshore Learning to see if they had anything like this and they didn't have it so I bought this product and I think it makes learning to read/spell a lot of fun. Kuddos on this one even if the letter quality isn't the best."
4,Lots of fun,"I purchased this for my 3 and 5 year old and they both love it! I was very happy to discover that all the letters in the alphabet are included, even though they are not all needed for the puzzles. There is a puzzle on both sides of each board. My children play with this everyday. We have had it for a week now and it has already provided hours of fun.My only complaint is that the letters chip easily. I have already had to glue one of the letters back together. I am, however, still very happy with this toy and its educational value. I do recommend it, and would buy it again."
3,Nice toy to learn to spell but only a few words,This was a nice concept to learn to put together words and associate pictures with the words. This puzzle only had 16 words to spell so there were not too many words to put together. This is a nice toy but kind of pricey.
2,"Nice toy but missing letter ""O""","Unfortunately, there is no letter O in the box so a few words can not be filled. My 4-year old likes it other wise I would return it.Update:The customer service mailed me 5 letter O quickly after it's contacted. Well, Amazon does not allow me to change the count of stars any more."
4,great learning tool for pre-readers,"Bright, colorful and educational. Surprisingly even 3-4yr olds can differentiate between d, b and p to make words. Definitely a fun puzzle but because of the limited word selection it's probably more useful in a preschool scenario then at home where kids might tire of it too quickly."
3,M&D quality lacking,"We loved the idea of this toy but were not so impressed with the quality. The paint and wood on the letters chip easily, though the spelling boards themselves hold up great. I was surprised to find that the pictures are pretty outdated looking, but that is my fault (look at the image and you'll see the car looks like it's from the mid-80's) for not noticing before purchasing. Also, it would be nice to have words that are more sounds-like-it's-spelled instead of words with digraphs, which are tough for initial spelling work. All in all, we wouldn't purchase this again."
5,Perfect toy for my 2yo old,"My 2yr old daughter absolutely loves this toy. It is strong, durable and the picture is great for them to make word associations. Plus its QUIET! I hate toys that are constantly making unnecessary and annoying sounds. She will make sounds like the picture provided. Its fantastic watching her grasp the words. She is making great progress and speaking in sentences pretty clearly. Its a great learning tool. I would like a lid to the box and a few more placards that include some of the letters like X,V & W but that would be my only complaint. We also use the letters outside of the word cards to trace and play with. For the price, durability and its re-useable qualities and versatility I highly recommend this product. Its working wonders for my 2yr old."
4,engaging toy,A very good toy for preschoolers who are moving beyond knowing their letters to assembling words. A flexible product in that you can develop your own games and approaches to using these puzzles. Well made as expected with M&D stuff.
2,2nd one with missing parts,"This was a replacement for one bought during holidays as gift. Toys itself is very nice, however, both of them had missing parts.Must be a factory error. Would not recommend."
5,Great fun and educational puzzle,"Toddlers and preschoolers love to play with this puzzle. The littler ones don't necessarily pick up the letters, but it can't hurt with starting to think/talk about letters."
4,No C's to Some C's,We received this for Christmas. We didn't open it until February. 6 of the puzzles contain words such as Cat which contains the letter C. The puzzles did not come with any Cs. I called Melissa and Doug. They sent us two C's for the puzzles.
3,Great idea poorly made,"I run a small preschool, of 6 children ages 2-5. I buy Melissa and Doug products all the time. Most of the time I feel they are very educational and made well. This See & Spell is not the case. The fake wood is all cracked and bits are coming off. Like it skips the sanding step when it was being made. The color cover for the letters is missing or coming out on a handful of the letters. The children have had it for less then two days. I noticed the cracks and problems the first day when one of the children asked for a lesson on it. Should have looked more closely before giving it to the children.Idea itself is great. Very educational game and the children love it. Just some of the letters I have had to take away, so they don't get hurt. Just really disapointed in this product. It doesn't hold up to the high standards I have for Melissa & Doug products. Hopefully it was just a bad batch and no one else has this problem."
5,My 3 years old loves it and it doesnt make a mess!,"I bought this for my son because he loves puzzles and putting things in outlined areas. i also bought it because it comes with a case that holds all the letters and boards. when things have a specific place my son always cleans up after himself, which is nice. so far ive had it about a month and he has played with it everyday and whenever he completes them he runs over to me and tells me to look at his work. he gets very excited over this and it is sturdy. he has yet to break any one the letters. the colors are very bright and it comes with plenty of extra letters. very cool!"
4,Puzzles,Very cool puzzles. My son really enjoys these puzzles. He has been learning to spell at not even 3 years old thanks to these puzzles.
3,"Nice Puzzle, No Lid","This is a nice word puzzle to help teach spelling, but there is no lid/container/bag/something to keep all those small letters from getting everywhere. The boards are not a big deal, but those small letters do not want to stay. Fun while your playing with it (Awesome for the kid), but a nightmare when it is time to put it away (Not so awesome for mom and dad)."
3,Missing letters make this toy frustrating.,"The package arrived totally sealed and in new condition. However, there are no O or K letters in the package. Numerous words require those letters and it is extremely frustrating for our grandson. Bottom line: the missing O and K are not ""OK""."
5,Great teaching tool,"My 2 year old daughter loves puzzles, and this is such a fun toy. Of course she cannot read yet, but this will be a great teaching tool down the road when she starts to learn how to read."
1,Big dissapointment,Don't waste your money! This is nothing more than a plastic bin that you can pick up at any craft store. I thought there would be nice holders (like the picture shows) but the plastic bin has cheap little folding holders. Not at all what it looks like in the picture!
1,not worth the price,This was not what I expected. The latches broke off the 2nd time I opened it. very dissapointed.
2,"Nice design, but the handle is too weak.","I bought this about a year ago, and I have a very few photos sorted into it, and a set of christmas cards that I have been planning on finishing for ages. The box isn't full, and sees very little use. However, the last time I went to move it, the handle broke off completely. Now it is useless. The handle is weak, and may very well break much sooner than you think. The rest of the box seems ok, and fairly study, but the handle the part that sees most wear & tear is poorly designed. I wouldn't buy it again.Too bad, I really liked the picture boxes with this, it was a good way to sort & organize projects."
4,Comprehensive resource for boat or RV wiring,"My interest in this book came after looking at some others that were written for RV's, 12 volt, and house wiring. None of those resources did quite what I needed, but this one does. Interestingly, my needs are not in boats, but vans and RV's. This book doesn't cover RV's, but it is the best resource that I've found for mobile wiring practices, materials, and design. The way this book is written is readable and understandable, without getting too jargon-laden. I'm not an engineer, but after working with this book, I am pretty confident that I can design a basic electrical system safely and using the correct materials. If I had to choose one resource to finish my RV wiring project, this one would be it."
5,An electrical handbook you can actually use,I'm restoring a 46 year old sailboat and I have several books that have taught me how to do differant portions of the work. And many of those books have sections on the electrical work that I need to accomplish. But none of them gave it to me in a way that I could easily understand it like this book does. So many of the questions I had were answered by this book that gives you what you need and not a lot more. I would highly reccomend it.
3,"Good info, very detailed, but over my head","This book is way over my expertise. It is in-depth and probably a very good resource for many people with cabin cruisers and larger boats with sleeping quarters and galleys, etc. I was looking for a more basic electrical book for my deckboat...more like ""simple electrical for boat owning dummies""."
5,Great book on boat electronics.,"This is a great book on electronics for any boat owner. Written by a physics professor (Also founder of two Owner-Builder schools.) in a down to earth manor that even I can understand. (People have been born and gone through college since I was in school.) The book has all of the technical information, coupled with easy to understand examples and illustrations. Plus, this book is loaded with detailed information on your boat's entire electrical system. All information in this book complies with the 'American Boat and Yacht Council' standards. (ABYC) The author of the book has a mission to educate boat owners on the various electronics in their boats, and how to repair them wisely."
3,More speculation than science,"I found this a bit disappointing, expecting a scientific investigation of theories put forth by Buddhism. Instead the majority of the book focuses on social science, as opposed to experimental. Meaning a lot of speculation, musings on meta-analysis, and little actual proof or falsification of anything. It's enjoyable for what it is, and I'd have found it very enjoyable as a random discovery amid books on philosophy. But a bit of a letdown given the impression of hard science the blurbs present."
5,KUDOS DAVID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"wow, being a sga fan, i had never really seen david hewlett in anything else....and believe me, i loved sga.....so when hulu aired this movie, i had to watch it......when all the laughing and screaming was done, i oredered it.....i LOVED THIS COMEDY....and when i say i loved it i do......ive shown it to some of my family and friends.....and the same thing happed....laughing and screaming.....david hewlett......im saying you have a keen sense of humor and dont ever let it go to waste......FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A Dog's Breakfast is Hillariously Funny!,The only movie I have watched that made me laugh from begining to end. Great Job to the Cast and Crew!
5,You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this movie,"I sat down with this movie as a favor to my daughter, a loyal David Hewlitt fan. I am completely won over! This is a quirky, unexpected gem of a movie. It pokes fun at everything from horror to sci-fi to mysteries. It's obvious cast and crew had a blast filming this - and you'll have fun watching it. Sorry I can't say more, but I don't want to give anything away. Have fun!"
2,Not so good,"I didn't think much of this film. After reading another reviewer's suspicions that the reviews were written mostly by just a few persons, I am inclined to agree. It's a strange movie. I love humor but didn't find much to like in ""A Dog's Breakfast."" I can't agree with the glowing reviews."
2,Sophomoric humor that tries too hard,"I rented this movie based upon the glowing reviews here at Amazon. I find it hard to believe the reviewers watched the same movie as I did.The main character's (played by David Hewlett) continuous panicked reaction to the unfolding plot line quickly become monotonous. To top it off, the outcome will be obvious to anyone that's ever watched a television sit-com.The title should be edited a bit to simply: A Dog."
1,What's going on here?,"HOW is this awful movie getting such high ratings? How are my fellow SG fans finding this crap funny at all?? I LOVE the cast of SG, but this movie was painful to watch, embarassing and NOT funny...is it a Canadian thing?? lol. I was expecting something like The 'Burbs."
2,Get ready to yawn.,"This is a mediocre movie pumped to 5 stars by blatant sock-puppetry. I rarely see an Amazon DVD with 5 stars and over 100 reviews. On that basis alone I purchased _A Dog's Breakfast_. Mistake.At first I thought what I was seeing here were a contingent of vocal Stargate fans, too besotted with their favorite actors appearing in a non-genre venue to see its limitations.After further reflection, it's pretty clear to me that most of the reviews were written by one or two people. Read a dozen of the 5 star reviews and you'll begin to hear the same screechy voice coming out of the mouths of nearly one hundred sock puppets.This is not a good movie.Don't get me wrong--it isn't a terrible movie either. But the capable acting doesn't save this tepid comedy from a poorly structured plot and lackadaisical pacing. I snickered a few times but was otherwise bored throughout."
5,Worth Every Penny,"This is a really fun family film, not to be missed. It's the kind of movie that you can share with all family members, friends, neighbors - anyone who loves to laugh.What I found amazing is that not only does David Hewlett write, direct and act - he also does his own incredible slapstick stunts!Hewlett's facial expressions alone make the movie a standout. So don't worry about taking a chance with this film - it's worth every penny!"
4,Spider Killer!!!,"This a great independent film. It's a great film that has to do with a man who who's sister comes to visit him, she surprises him with the news she is getting married. Comedy persues as he tries to kill his sisters fiance. This movie is an original and great for children over twelve."
4,Too funny!,If you're a David Hewlett fan you must see this. I found myself laughting from the start. Very enjoyable and worth a second look.
4,IMPRESSIVE DEBUT FROM HEWLETT!,"Not knowing this film's star and director previously may have kept me from giving this film a solid 5 stars, but I did enjoy it and considering the budget, it's a very impressive debut. The story is well paced and funny, but I was a little frustrated with the plot. It's quirky and funny most of the time, but I found some plot elements irritating. It's a very good film worth seeing. Thanks FM for pointing this on out to me!"
5,This Film is No Dog! It Shines!,"I am a tough crowd for comedy--having said which, this movie is absolutely hilarious. It's a twisted comedy, but it all comes out right in the end. The actors are marvelous--admittedly, Mars the Dog steals every scene he's in, but the humans are pretty good, too! The production was made on a dime, but it is an indie film. There's a Gorgeous scene of David Hewlett (you'll know it when you see it)! I highly recommend this movie."
5,Dog-Gone Delightful!,"A great comedy! Whether you like quirky humour or you're a fan of Stargate, this movie's for you. Fun Characters, great acting, and an adorable dog. Five stars!"
5,More than just what the dog dragged in,"I have to admit that I was pleasently surprised by ""A Dog's Breakfast"". I origionally bought it because of David Hewlett and only HOPED that I would like the movie. In less than a month I have seen it six times simply because it is one of the best movies I have seen. It's a family-friendly murder mystery that keeps you wondering what in the blue-blazes is going on right until the end. Parts had me laughing so hard I was crying.David Hewlett is halarious as Patrick and Kate Hewlett shines as his sister. Paul McGillion is a riot as the somewhat clueless Ryan, but you love them all despite--or because of--their rather odd quirks.This is a movie for anyone and everyone--and I really do mean that. I have rarely enjoyed a movie so much. It is sweet and twisted all at the same time, and weirdly enough it works well!I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes something that's just silly enough to be charming--and then be happily surprised in the end."
4,My Kids loved this movie!,My Kids loved this movie! They couldn't stop laughing!!! They watched it over and over again! Very funny for Kids!
3,good and smooth,"Terrific voice, backed mostly by a small ensemble of piano, guitars, percussion, etc. No huge sweeping string arrangements, this is much more contemporary MPB leaning towards 'smooth jazz' with a Brazilian flavor.Some songs are ballads, all but one kept my (non-Portuguese) interest. The mid-tempo songs are great; no tracks loaded with percussion for dancing or ""chill mix.""Portuguese lyrics included, great photos.This recording is smooth and good for that mood. However, I really, really like her other CD, ""Seio de Bahia."""
4,Music In Film (NPR Milestones of the Millennium,"Great CD;the music is crystal clear with an excellent variety demonstrating the wide variety of musical talents in Hollywood. Liner notes are also most interesting, explaining some of the history behind the cuts and pointing out differences in the composers styles...as with John Barry. His style ranges from ""the Lion in Winter"" bold dramatic soundtrack to the exquisitley tender ""Dances with Wolves"" theme music. A CD to enjoy over and over"
3,I just wanted Michele Kwan's East of Eden - not there - sad!,"The one song I was interested in - East of Eden - was the shortest on the whole CD the rest of the music was okay, but nothing to get excited about."
5,Buen Libro,"Lectura recomendada para los clínicos en salud mental y asi poder entender más a nuestros pacientes, vale la pena revisarlo!!"
2,You may not be getting what you think you are getting.,"Many of us are familiar with the tall ""Step into Reading"" leveled books. I thought these were going to be the same. They are little short books with no color, but your kids can color the pages. I think they are helpful to add to your reading program like Hooked on Phonics, but these are not books your child will read over and over again most likely. If I would have known what these books looked like before I ordered them I would not have but now that I have them I will make them a part of my child's reading program. If you have Hooked on Phonics kinder level, these books are similar...no color, same binding, and small. I paid about 1 dollar per book so I am not so upset, just not what I was expecting."
1,Don't bother,"These were TINY, horribly bound books with the poorest illustrations I have seen. These books were not appealing at all to my five-year-old."
1,Good thing I borrowed before buying...,"If I'd wanted a Pilates tape, I'd have bought one. This tape is almost nothing but Pilates-type matwork. By the time she got to some yoga poses well over 30 minutes into it, I was feeling as if I'd been bamboozled and hornswoggled by the ""Yoga"" portion of the title, causing me to turn it off in irritation and protest before it was completely finished.I guess if you want a Pilates video, this one isn't bad. Just try to borrow it from the library first before you make that purchase leap."
5,Stephanie Foster : Yoga -Intermediate Level,"I thought that this was the best in-home video class that I have ever taken in my LIFE! Stephanie Foster makes me feel more in-tuned and aware of my body, and also aware of my strength, that has definitely increased. Keep up the Good Work Stephanie Foster. To everyone you may be sore, but you won't be sorry!!:)"
1,Junk,"Put this bottle stopper in a bottle of asti. First bottle we put it in. Tried to pull it out and the cork stayed. Had to take it out with a cork screw. Cute stopper , but junk.Chihuahua White/Tan Wine Bottle Stopper - DTB06B"
4,it's great,I received the items and was surprise to see that it's really nice for the price that i pay It's Worth it; I will still order if there's still available.
3,Don't like it,"For this price, you really can't complain about anything. But the material feels pretty cheap. For people who wants good price and quality, this is not your selection."
1,Not as good as all the reviews stated!,"I listen to the samples and I liked a few of them so I puchased the CD.However when I played CD I was disapointed in some of the characters. The drunk charactor is stupid. The Junkyard and Southerner sound to fake, and think that not to much planning went into the taping of this product.I did get some laughs from the tape but would never buy another version."
3,"good power, bad design","This drill has tons of power for the price, but the battery is huge which makes it hard to manuver the drill"
4,slow lovin and thuggin,I ain't goin' ta lie I only got for the 1 song ......slow love..... I couldn't find it anywhere...but that one song is of the hook
2,It's not what I have expected,"The item was not what I have expected, very short DVD (15minutes) and not a real guide, lack of information and it was not a price worthed item. I recommend a book instead. My Labrador puppy needs the best training and the item I bought wasn't helpful at all."
3,Disappointed,"As a scientist, physician, and sailor, I consider myself fairly good at assimilating technical material, but I had trouble with this book. The author (like the NOAA meterologists who write those impenetrable forecast discussions) does not seem content to stick with one set of terms. A better editor would have helped him do so. One of the main thrusts of the text is the relationship between upper atmosphere phenomena (troughs and ridges) and surface conditions. After reading the book, I still don't have a satisfying grasp of how this relationship works, mainly, I think, because the phenomena are defined in descriptive rather than mechanistic terms. I am going to read it again, but will be looking for something better."
5,An ideal book for learning weather,As Director of Ocean Navigator's School of Seamanship I have chosen Michael Carr's book as our textbook due to its high quality of content and material presentation. Michael is our instructor for weather and oceanography seminars and his book represnts years of first hand experience and information gathering.
3,Ambiguous explainations,"I learn pretty well from books and have taught myself some rather complex things that way. As a sailor and technical person, with some understanding of weather prediction and understanding weather charts going in, I still found the information difficult to assimilate. The author frequently uses terms without defining them, and his descriptions are often ambiguous, making understanding the material frustrating. I am reading it for the second time, and still find this to be the case. For example, he will make reference to something ""below the [upper level] trough"", and you need to somehow figure out whether he means closer to the equator, since the plane of the waves is north-south; or closer to the earth. The material is very useful, but he needed a better editor or proof-reader"
5,Fine book but you need more to understand weather systems,This is a well-written book but the reader needs a basic weather textbook or general weather book to get the most of Capt. Carr's book.
3,Size vs. Reception,"The previous wireless PCMCIA card I had stuck out about an inch from my laptop. It was broken in an accident, severly disabling its reception. My laptop has two PC card slots, and I have been wanting to put a USB 2 card adapter in the other one. However, all the other wireless network cards have antennas that prevent putting two cards into the slots.This Iogear card is very small, solving my problem. It only sticks out about a quarter inch from my computer, and does not get any thicker on its protrusion. If you are looking for an inexpensive (I paid $8 for mine after a $20 mail-in rebate), low-profile wireless G card and don't need a super-strong antenna, go with this one. My experience seems to confirm the other reviewers' comments: a shorter antenna equals relatively weak reception. Otherwise, the card works fine. It is backwards compatible with 802.11b networks, as well."
2,Low Profile = Low Antennae Power,"This wireless card works great and is super fast... as long as you are using it within 30' of a transmitter. I work in a building that is completely Wireless-G, and only when I'm in a room with a transmitter in it or when I can actually see the transmitter sticking out of the ceiling, does it work fine. Otherwise, it picks up a weak signal intermitantly and never allows you to connect. Spend a few more dollars and get something that actually works reliably."
1,Terrible reception range.,Read the other reviews. This card has horrible reception range. Mine is going back today. I even tried it inside a Starbucks and could only get reception in one seat in the place. My Wireless B card allows me to even go outside...
1,"poor excuse for a ""G"" card",i worked with my card for over 2 weeks and several phone calls to the useless customer support group. and to no avail. i returned my card. it stops working after a few minutes and doesn't shut down when removed. so rebooting does no good. it says it's working when it actually isn't. signal strength @ 5 feet is marginal. it appears to be a really poorly designed wireless card.
1,"Good specs, but does not work in the real world","I saw the rebate offer and said to myself, ""what the heck, I'll get this as a back-up wi-fi adapter."" Over the weekend I played wtih it and let me tell you, this thing just does not work. It simply cannot connect to any wi-fi AP. Its reception capability is even worse than the built-in 802.11b in my 2-year-old Fujitsu laptop. I literally held the laptop right next to my AP and this thing still couldn't detect it. When I went to a public place with lots of hotspots -- I know it because my Fujitsu and the Netgear WG511 PC Card work totally fine there -- this thing connected only once but then dropped after five minutes.I thought I got a defective unit, until I read the reviews here on Amazon. Apparently this is just a bad product. It's not even worth the after-rebate price of $9."
1,Upset with the stuff and customer services,"I bought this card since it is small and it said it has some features that match with my college wireless systems. But, the card failed to fulfil its promises. It can detect the signal for the first minutes, then gone forever even I work just two or three feet from the router.The more upset thing is the customer services. They always busy all the time. I was on hold twice for 15 minutes with no respond. They only open during the weekday from morning to 5:50: no extended hour. They said on their answering machine that their internet support will answer my problem. But when I browsed their homepage, even this product (i.e. GWP512) has not listed on their support list yet.I will send back this card."
2,Beware of Compatibility with IBM ThinkPad,"Just a warning to anyone considering buying this to use with an IBM ThinkPad. I bought this item after careful scrutiny of the Operating System and PC requirements for compatibility. Although there is no good reason it should not be compatible with my IBM ThinkPad T41 running Windows XP, it continually causes the ""blue screen of death"" error after 5 minutes of use. IOGear felt it was a warranty issue so I now have a new card that does the same thing. I have used other wireless cards in the same computer that work fine with no errors, so I can only assume it is a compatibility problem with this specific card. (However, for the 5 minutes before the error occurs, the card works fine.)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This card is a complete waste of money. First of all, my SMC 802.11b wireless card out performs this 802.11g wireless card by leaps and bounds. My signal went from Exellent to Poor by switching cards without changing locations. I lose signal all the time with this card and it is CONSTANTLY communicating with my router - with or without someone using my laptop. I am extremely disappointed and will think twice before buying anything IOGEAR again."
3,"Not bad, but not the best if you need long range","I love that the card only sticks out a bit from the laptop. I'm not sure if I'd pack up the laptop with the card still in it, but it sticks out far less than other wireless cards. The downside, as you've probably heard from the other reviews, is that the reception is not as good as with other cards. That's the tradeoff. This card works fine for me, but I wouldn't get it if you're looking for maximum distance and signal strength. My D-Link DWL-G650 has much better reception.Update: 4/2007I still like the card a lot, but it's really only good when it's near my router. Even with my new D-Link DI-634 MIMO router, I can't get a signal at a location where I can get a 60% signal with my USB adapter and my D-Link DWL-G650 PCMCIA card. It's nice for getting rid of a wire, but don't expect long range reception. For that, get yourself a USB wireless adapter with a USB extension cord: that way, you can position the antenna for best reception."
3,decent dance c.d.,"I really enjoy the music in regards to quality; however, as an Irish step dancer, a few of the songs- such as the slip jig (song #2)- are a bit fast. The reels and hornpipes are easy to dance to, though. I would recommend this c.d. to anyone who enjoys Irish stepdancing or simply likes to listen to Irish music."
4,Pretty good.,"Not the best book I've ever read, but certainly a page turner. I read it in two days. Definitely a must-read."
4,worth a read,I enjoyed this book because the characters were more developed than in most books of this reading level. The story keeps your attention and moves along quickly which is surprising due to its long length (compared to other books of this type).
3,"Well...clingers and ""swingers""","I purchased this because I'm tired of giving all my seed to the grackles that flock to my feeder. This one makes them work a little harder to get the seed, but get it they do--one way or another. It's true that they can't perch comfortably, so they swing back & forth so the seed falls to the ground. Also when they fly, the feeder tips and more seed spills. So it's a nice little feeder, it's just not as successful at keeping the greedy birds away."
2,"Cute little feeder, but big birds clean it out with no problem","Although this little feeder is meant for the small clinging birds, the larger birds such as jays, starlings, and grackles, ALL will hang on it and eat the seeds. They will run the little guys off, and empty it in no time. It is definitely not large bird proof. I finally got discouraged and just took it down."
4,It works,"I have been using this feeder for about a month. I bought it because large birds, mostly grackles were taking over, chasing all the small birds away, it has worked but not completely. After several days the grackles who can't acess the food at the bottom, now will occasionally get on top of the feeder and shake it until the food falls to the ground. It still is better than before, the small birds still use it, and it's less food hitting the ground. Top screws off to refill. I would recommend it as one of the type feeders you should have."
3,Excursion to medeival Japan,"Namioka's ""young adult"" book is a gentle, amiable mystery story set in Medeival Japan. While it didn't have quite enough historical detail for my tastes (I like a book that ""takes me someplace I've never been""), I enjoyed the idiosyncratic characters and the low-key atmosphere. It's not too tough to solve the mystery, however!"
1,Sending it back,I don't like this game because there are brackets around all the numbers and letters of the cards and it makes it very difficult to see what there are.....You also have to hold it at an odd angle to see it at all.....................
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed with this game. To install the batteries was next to impossible. The back has to be removed with an extremely small screw driver or other device. Once that was done the sound quality sounded worse than the original Nitendo sets. It was annoying at best. The display picture was very difficult to see. A deck of playing cards would have been better.
4,"Cool shoe, but narrow.","These look similar to K-Swiss shoes, but they are much more narrow than they seem. I have decently narrow feet, so they fit me well. However, if you have wider feet, or even medium feet, these may be a bit narrow for you. Other than that, they slip on great and feel fine. Good for the price!"
4,Sweet story,"Patricia C. McKissack always has a story worth telling. This is a lovely little tale about three children who are trying to cope with a mean neighborhood dog. Tippy Lemmey is a dog with a first AND last name and he is chasing them and snapping at their heels as they pass his turf. I loved the kids inventiveness as they try to out think and out run the dog. The children do not wish the dog harm even though he is making their life a misery. The story has a nice resolution, which is a relief--I always worry about ""dog"" stories (à la No More Dogs by Gordon Korman) With only 64 pages this is a perfect book for those children transitioning to ""chapter books."""
1,Everyone's right - this is JUNK,"We bought this with a gift card from our wedding, and it hasn't even lasted for 2 years of semi-regular use. My weight readings didn't fluctuate as much as other reviewers, though. Also - the batteries are NOT replaceable. I'm going to invest in a different scale next time, something a little more expensive will be worth it if it lasts longer."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Don't waste your money on this scale...You DO have to reset it before each use-it takes 2 to 3 tries to get it to reset and the weight is 3 lbs off. During the 2nd week of use, the scale weighed everyone at 1.0 lbs. It's now in the trash can."
1,Don't buy it!,"I just received it today.Look: From the image online, it looks like steel/silver. It's actually WHITE plastic. The site says ""Product DescriptionStylish injection molded platform. Solid Steel construction."" Solid steel????Battery: I wanted to test it. The LCD says ""LO."" According to the manual, the batteries (2 of them) need to be replaced. Under this product's features: ""Features a built-in Lithium digital battery that never needs replacing."" What happened to the ""never needs replacing?"" Fine, all batteries do run out, but it's already ran out and I just received it!Last, but very important: Don't put this scale on tiles. The scale is not designed to be skid proof; you will break your back if you do that."
2,Interesting scale,"It's a relatively good size, and simple as well. You just step on it, then it takes a second and your weight blinks. However, it seems that my weight can fluxuate (according to this scale anyhow) in a 3-5 Lb. range throughout the day. One time, I measured myself 5 times in ten minutes to test, and it was always fluxuating through a 5 lb range."
2,not accurate at all,"I bought this to replace my really cheap scale that I bought for 5 dollars at target because my friend thought it was inaccurate. I wanted an lithium electronic scale anyhow so I bought this last year.I'm not getting the lo battery thing and I had it for more than a year. HOWEVER, it's not accurate at all! I test it every morning and it fluctuates around 3 lbs (I'm a light person so that's a lot) up or down. It's very frustrating and I think I'll be investing in a new scale because I'm sure this scale is lying to me."
2,Poor quality water slide,Got this for my son's birthday party. He and his friends had a blast with it. Worked out great but literally only used it THREE times and the motor started smoking!!! Had to have the motor replaced....very disappointed!
1,SAFE FAIlL,"I bought this for a 13 year old girl for her graduation. Not only did it not have an actual safe or key but the ""black velvet"" thing inside fell out. Also why would i get one with a black baseball player? Not happy and you should not buy this."
2,Disappointing and Uneven,"Although Ms. London is a fine writer, and I enjoyed this novel, it was a disappointing read. Maybe this is a continuation in a series, and I have missed the earlier stories. The connections between the ancestors, parents, brother and protagonists were, at times, muddled and not constructive to developing the plot or characters. Or maybe I have missed earlier books in this series if this is a series and am therfore operating at a disadvantage (that the author did not resolve). In any event, some aspects of the book were well developed, some overdone and some underdone."
1,Very unhappy!,"This shirt was much smaller than the typical size associated with the sizing chart. It was of inferior quality. Worst of all, despite the fact that it was shipped free, I was charged for full shipping when I had to return this ill-advised purchase. I don't think I will order clothing from Amazon again."
5,Top Drawer Stuff,"I have a closet full of Tommy dress shirts and, trust me, I don't have an athletic build anymore and I've never had a fit problem w/ their shirts. So, I'm at a loss as to what Fred is talking about. The button-down collars on these shirts are fabulous. Full and flowing, with or without a tie. I definitely recommend them and agree with Ralph. Topdrawer Stuff all the way."
4,THE KILLER ROCKS THE HOUSE,"JERRY LEE LEWIS DOES FOR THE PIANO IN ITS BOOGIE-WOOGIE FORM WHAT ELMORE JAMES AND T-BONE WALKER DID FOR THE SLIDE ELECTRIC GUITAR. IN SHORT, TRANSFORMED THE INSTRUMENT INTO THE EQUIVALENT OF A ONE MAN BAND. NAME ANOTHER ROCK PIANIST WHO CAN COMPARE IN ENERGY. GIVE UP. THERE ARE PLENTY OF CLASSICS HERE AND A FEW COVERS. THE TECHNICAL END LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED BUT THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL IN THESE TYPES OF LIVE RECORDINGS."
4,"It's a 4.5"" Statue not a 6"" Action figure","It's a rather high detail mini statue of Batman with very few joints of articulation. although there are some but they move in not natural directions so lets assume that there are not any.It\s originally a statue not a toy, built for display in a collection. and it's not 6"" alone but with the stand so the main statue is rather small and probably won't fit with your other 6"" statues and figures.and good to mention that, it's a high quality product and it's made in China. cause it has been produced for Japanese market, doesnt mean that it's made in Japan."
1,Cables do not pass good video,These claim to be DVI dual-link cables able to pass video up to 1536x2048. I could not get them to even pass 800x600 cleanly. Unfortunately I did not discover this until after I had spent several hours running three cables above a drop ceiling and down into the walls. I replaced them with cables from MonoPrice.com They work perfectly. Buyer be ware.DaveJ
4,"Shoes look nice, fit well, not enough cushioning","The shoes -- I'm wearing them now -- look just as advertised, and they are a comfortable fit. I would not recommend them for extensive walking, unless you add a cushioning insole. I was pleased to learn upon their arrival that the shoes were made in Brazil, and not China."
4,Quality Product,Very nice/comfortable shoes. Only issue is they scuff easily and require a polish often.
4,"Not bad, a little tight in the width","Pros: look great, good qualityCons: little tight for width (stretches after time), and soles aren't waterproof.At around 20 bucks, great value."
2,"Good service, good brand but regular ending","Muy buen servicio el de Amazon. Compré un par de zapatos Florsheim, reconociendo el excelente prestigio de esta marca, pero las costuras que están en la parte de atrás, junto al talon, están muy mal terminadas, de tal manera que el día en que me los estrené me sacaron una ampolla en el talón... una vez hecha un apequeña ""cirujia"" al zapato este problema se solucionó."
5,The best music trilogy since Star Wars.,"Dark, moody, and diabolical, and that's just the first track! Each of the music for the three films stands alone(don't listen to this trilogy alone, though). Joseph LoDuca is one of the finest composer's today. His ability to place scene with music is unreal. He has mastered the art of sound manipulation and can turn on you like a demonic zombie. This set is sure to please every horror fan, or anyone who enjoys a good, malicious movie score. Nice addition from Danny Elfman on the 3rd disco too!"
5,scottish voices,This is one of the most timeless and vital performances of traditional scotish songs we are ever likely to hear. The directness and unadorned voice and the spare musical arrangements are all in service of the diverse stories and laments that the material incorporates. The song Baron O'Brackley is a masterpiece - the telling of the slaying of a landowner and the changing allegiances of the surviving family members.
5,Five Alarm Fire,"Ashley makes great use of contrasting tones and tempos to craft a worthwhile disc. His own tap-guitar playing is impressive and hits like a hurricane in spots. The musicians who collaborated on the project with him lend solid support. The compositions work well together and offer several striking themes. Those who enjoy music that blurs stylistic boundaries, offers plenty of long furious improvisational jams and conveys the performers' sense of enthusiasm will likely find this disc both enjoyable and intriguing."
3,I have mixed feelings on this book,"This set wasn't the best one I've owned on totem animals. The information was pretty good but there wasn't all that much. It includes some history on totems, a few legends, and backround on 20 common totems. The cards were extremely cheap and I only got to use them a few times before they wore. Also, the CD wasn't very good material in my opinion. I would really only reccomend this set for beginners."
2,CHEAP THIN CARDS!!,WHY BOTHER TO GET A DECK PUBLISHED AT ALL IF THE PUBLISHER IS TOO CHEAP TO DO IT RIGHT??? WHEN YOU GET A DECK THAT FALLS APART AFTER A FEW WEEKS IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE DECK AND THE AUTHOR AS WELL!! OLDER DECKS AT LEAST CAN BE COUNTED ON FOR THICK CARDS. BUY PRE 1995 ON ANY DECK.
4,Close to the real thing.,"This toy is great for little girls who like to pretend they are shopping. Not only can you by food, you can also buy clothes, stereos, toys and all different items. The American Express Card is a cute feature. The is really close to the real thing."
3,"Great toy, but didn't last 3 weeks!","I had such high hopes for this toy! My 4-year-old received it for Christmas and just loved it -- especially the microphone. But the entire thing (except the microphone) stopped working less than 3 weeks after Christmas! To make matters worse, when I went to exchange it, I couldn't find it at any local Target store so, since I bought it at 1/2 price right before Christmas, I had to return it and lose out on my special deal. (Not to mention a VERY sad little girl...) The lady who helped me with the return said her grand-daughter had one going on 3 years so I'm hopeful mine was just a lemon, but the reviews I've read on other boards seem to indicate a real problem with durability. I probably will buy another one (though probably not at the normal $40 price tag -- the toy isn't durable enough for that kind of price), but will make sure I keep the receipt AND the box it came in for awhile..."
3,Too complicated for a 5 year old,I purchased the Barbie cash register for my 5 year old. In order to use the register properly you need to know how to read. The age limits on the box are deceiving. She still plays with it but I think it is much more suitable for a child of 6 or 7.
3,Fun?,I bought this toy when it first came out! It was fun for the first day. I have played with it on and off in the past year.Now this being the secong year I really don't play with it and the credit cards have moved to other sets!! Fun? No! Boring? Yes!
3,Half and Half,"I bought this cash register when it first came out about 2 years ago. I used and used the first week, but then I lost interest in in it. My ""debt"" card hes moved to another set, and listening to the Barbie's voice go on and on got really anoying. Also, on the old commercial I though that the scanner let you scan anything! But instead you just get to slide cards through. I think that if you are under the age of 8 1/2 you will be pretty boared."
1,Complicated -- Do what it says or it won't play,"Who on earth designed a kid's cash register toy that gives you an error message when you press the number buttons? My daughter turned it on, pressed a number and received an annoying ""TRY AGAIN"" message. Then another number ""TRY AGAIN"", and ""TRY AGAIN"". You must select a product category, a product number, and a total key before you the cash register will deign to say ""Seven"" when you press the 7 key. Also, when Barbie says ""Scan your Barbie savings card"", brother, you better have that card otherwise this toy won't let you do another thing. This is fun?"
5,It really adds up,"My daughter was 7 when I brought her this item. She would play with it morning, noon and night if allowed. The one feature that she loves is the microphone. I like this item because it provides hours of entertainment."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this cash register for my 6 yr old daughter last Christmas. Needless to say it was such a disappointment! The age range for this toy is so off, it is more for an 8 yr old than 3 and up. My daughter has not touched it. She gets to frustered with it when asked to figure up her purchase and the difference. She may use it when she gets older, but I recommended buying this for an older child."
2,Marketed for the wrong age,"This toy is as complicated as you can get! Do not recommend. Too many pieces confuse even adults. Could have been thought out better. Please don't purchase because your child wants a cash register, what they probably want is the microphone on it. That is the most my child uses with it because thats all she understands. Too confusing. Not worth your childs grief."
3,Recommended for older kids,"I got this cash register for my 3 year old who loves to pretend to shop. I expected a simple cash register, but it requires reading ability to play with it. Her favorite feature is the real microphone, but it seems to work on and off without any reason. She does like to play with it, but it never holds her attention very long."
2,Too advanced for non-reading child...,"My 5-year-old just got this toy for her birthday. It has caused more headaches than fun for her. Although she can put in items by item number, she cannot read the items on the screen. It requires pushing different buttons for every different task which is confusing for my daughter who can't read the words on the keys. The scanner also requires an extremely PRECISE motion of running the ""price tag"" through in order to work. Even I can only get it to ring through half the time. Overall we are very disappointed. My daughter desperately wanted a cash register for her b'day, then saw this barbie one and thought all her dreams came true! She would have been better off with a regular plain old cash register.In a year or so when she is reading I'm sure she will love it, but for now she quickly gets frustrated."
2,Not for children under 6,"I have a 4 year and it became very frusterating for her to use the register because it turns off automatically after 30 seconds. This does not give a child enough time to figure out what she wants to do or the items to use next. Even when she is in the middle of a sale if she takes too long to press the next button the machine will shut off and she has to start the sale over. I find the only thing she does use on this cash register is the microphone, everything else is too old for her age group."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this for my 5-year-old daughter's birthday. She and my 7-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter love the microphone, but otherwise this toy has been useless. Unless you have can read, have the patience to figure it all out and are very focused you will hear Barbie's ""Try again"" over and over and over. I would not recommend this one and believe the 4 and up age recommendation is very off base. We have returned it for a much cheaper, low tech model which beeps and calculates whether you are pressing the right buttons or not, just what they really wanted."
1,This review will save you money,What a disappointment this toy is! It doesn't really scan you have to slide the card thru. It seems durable but it is not used that much. The main thing my kids use on this toy is the microphone which does amplify your voice. My advice talk your kids into something else (wish I did).
4,scanner do not work.,"This is a great toy, it 's scanners stop working instantly though. My daughter still plays with it but misses the scanners."
2,"Agree, too advanced","One of my girls (4) received this as a gift and was excited about it for about ten minutes. The only thing she do was work the microphone. Which can be a bit annoying at times. Also, the coins are small and can be a choking hazard if you have other small children around. I have a six yr old who is just learning about money in school and it is confusing for her because the money doesn't even look like real money. They don't play with it."
1,Cheap Piece Of Crud!!!,I dont think i should even give this toy one star! I got this toy when i was 7 and now i'm 11. I'm warning you DOT BUY THIS TOY!! First of all the microphone of the toy didnt work when i got it. And when barbie talks it sounds like someone snoring!! It SUCKS!Dont waste your time and monye!!!
1,Lots of fun.. for about 2 weeks,I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas. She had lots of fun playing with it for about 2 weeks when it just stopped working. We tried new batteries and it still didn't work. I talked with others who have bought one and they said the same thing. Don't waist your money.
3,Age range way off!,"My daughter received this for Christmas when she was 3. She was way too young for this, but what can you do with a gift from Grandma? I think the age range should start at 7 or 8. The problem with this toy and younger kids is that they lose all the pieces. Now that she is 5 and could play with it more, all the money and credit cards are gone. My kids just use it for the microphone now. Save it until your child is old enough to appreciate it. I believe it would provide hours of fun for the child of the right age."
1,Too expensive and too complicated,"A register is a great idea, but this one is too regimented. Playing should be fun and allow a child to use their imagination. My five year old likes the microphone and playing with the money, but it won't let you play with it like a calculator. It took me a long time with the instructions to figure out how to use it, I hope they don't get lost. Perhaps when she is older, much older, she'll enjoy it. Another bad feature is that it sometimes does not turn off and drains the batteries. Keep it simple! This was a waste!"
4,A toy that talks too much but is also fun,"I find that this cash register talks too much. Whenever I want to press a button, it explains too me the instructions that I already know. If I want to buy something, I like to buy it quickly and then go shopping again. For children that are younger than me, it is a good toy, because they need lots of instructions on how to do things. Overall, besides the talking, it is a really fun toy, because it is like a real cash register. It has the item number button which you can type in an item # and you can get that item right away and pay for it. It also has a total button and Cash or Charge, etc. It keeps children busy and is very fun to play with. Thanks to the manufacturer for giving me a chance to play with this terrific toy."
4,Dreams Are Funny Things!,"Dreams can be funny things. Sometimes they are virtual nightmares and other times they are wondrous things that are simply magical in all its magnificence. ONCE UPON A DREAM has all this and more.The curse spanning generations through Robin Wise's family has left Robin agoraphobic, while Alex Simon's lack of trust towards women leaves him lonely and desolate inside. By day they quarrel constantly and by night they dream a heated passion between them, sending them to places unknown. While their love flourishes, they battle long-dead evils trying to change what was, to something better.Ms. Archer's novel of dreams and discovering the joys of love and happiness is a not-to-be-missed book! I anxiously await her next book!Romance At Its Best -"
5,Mit mucho tam,"Lucy Skeaping has used her careful study of Jewish songs - both Ashkenaz and Sepharad - to produce a highly idiomatic and infectious collection. The arrangements and backing by the Burning Bush group which Ms. Skeaping founded are wonderful. But, it is Skeaping's informed approach and charming voice that makes this an essential collection."
1,Keep searching if you're serious,"Although I agreed with a few things Lu Ann Bransby had to say in this topical counseling book, I found it rather hard to take much of it seriously. Many of the pictures that accompany the various topics are quite comical, and I don't think that is the intention of this book. Many of her statements in this book do not have a biblical basis, they are merely her own speculations. There were also a few topics (such as BOREDOM, for example) that she made out to be ""sins"" in some way or another. I found the book to be QUITE conservative and, as I mentioned, many of her speculations do not have biblical support. I would not recommend this to any serious counselor's out there looking for a good book to look to for references on certain subjects. The last thing you want to do to someone who is seeking God is to flood them with guilt, and that is the impression that I got from this book."
2,Collar,I was super excited to get my kitten this collar but facts on it were not specific enough and collar ended up not fitting her small neck :(
4,Good collar for the price,"Good collar that looked good on my cat. Got it just as it was described, the only negative thing is that it has frayed a little from the cat scratching at it."
1,Weak claspl,"Lovely collar with two big problems. Breakaway clasp opens constantly. During first week, I found kitty without her collar four times (she is an indoor cat, so was not participating in any extreme sports that might dislodge the collar). By contrast, her previous breakaway collar came off maybe once or twice a year. Also the rhinestones limit the adjustment capability of the collar. I tightened the collar as close as I could to the rhinestone ""obstacle""' and collar was still a bit loose on my 9-lb adult cat. It turns out that the clasp was the main problem, though."
5,Works fine not sure of the negative reviews.,"The collar stays on my cat most of the time and has only broke off one time when she got it caught on a corner, which is suppose to happen because you don't want your cat hanging herself/himself."
1,"cheap, cheap!",The collars fibers start to unravel easy after a little use. And the fake gems dont look that stylish. The bell is nice though.
1,Ugly and dangerous upgrade,"Do not buy. There are soooo many hardware issues with this upgrade that unless you have a brand new machine with Panther installed or have no peripherals and do not depend on your computer to work, avoid this like the plague. It is certainly more of a dog than a cat.I have reverted to 10.2 which is still very slow, and although I am a loyal Mac fan, I will use XP if I need to be productive in spite of security issues."
1,Hate it,This is the worst os ive ever used you can't hold down the button like windows and its exteremly hard to use you also cant get games for it
4,Good upgrade and worth the price IMHO,"I liked what Apple did with Jaguar, and Panther simply improves the performance and usability of OS X in my book. My PowerMac G4 starts up quicker and appears more stable (if that is possible over the already stable Jaguar). My OS 9 apps, like Hypercard (yes I still use that wonderful piece of software), and Photoshop, among others, work just as they are without alteration. I have also found new toys to play with such as Revolution (what Hypercard could have been) and the command line. My only complaint is that there is no true Outlook client for OS X. Yes, I know about Entourage X, and that is okay, or rather will be when my company migrates to Exchange 2003, or whatever comes after that.All in all a good upgrade and one I don't mind paying for."
5,Great deal,Fast service and a great deal..very pleased every thing on time and in place. worked very well I am happy.
4,Worked fine.,Even though the discs were well used and quite scratched they worked perfectly. And it brought my Bondi blue back to life.
1,Worse experience I have had on Amazon,"This was the worse experience I have had on Amazon. This product was nothing the seller said. I would never do business with them again, and Amazon should try to find more about sellers like the person who sold me this product and kick them off the Internet."
5,Another quantum leap.,"I've had the pleasure to use Panther over the summer, including the version that is now being released by Apple. There are several things you ought to know. (1) Speed. Every Mac I installed it on, from an iMac 500 DV to a G5 1.8 gHz felt easily twice as fast. It really is like getting a brand new computer. (2) RAM. This beast needs plenty of RAM; 512 MB at the least. (3) Expose. The new feature for dealing with multiple open windows and programs is priceless. Alone worth the expense of this software, I couldn't live without it.This is the best operating system on the market, bar none."
3,It's faster on an old 400Mhz G3 iMac,"Many improvements over 10.2. DVD player scan rate includes 16x and 32x. That's my second favorite improvement, but playing DVDs and surfing the 'net is just about all I do in my iMac. It's a 5 star product, but I'm giving it 3 because of problems that I, and several other people have had with the installation disks. I tried 3 copies of the disks from the Burlingame Apple store, plus one from another retail store, and all disk #2s were not readable on my iMac. Apple support tried to convince me that I needed to pay an outrageous sum of money to them to replace my DVD/CDROM drive, but I could not get it through to them that I use the drive all the time without problems. I ended up burning a copy of the defective disk on a computer that WOULD read it, and completed my installation. Bad media. Bad support. Two marks off. Check the Apple Support Discussions board, and you'll see the problems people are having with the disks."
5,Mac operating system,The product was just as described and was exactly what I needed. I was very pleased with the seller.
3,OS X 10.3 Panther,Good opperating system but has some bugs in it like when you are running Safari and iTunes at the same time it causes emergency shut downs on your computer. Would recomend getting the newer version like 10.4 of 10.5 when it comes out.
4,Most have upgrade,"System 10 is coming in to it's own with this udate, things sre looking more like when OS 9 came out with all the little refiments that make the diference in an OS. I love the new features, (users swicthing, faster response, fonts, )"
1,Do Not Buy Yet,"I have had a lot of trouble with this upgrade. It is still has some bugs. Has some nice features but not worth the headaches, yet.Explorer stopped working, locked out of iTunes, mail became read only, etc maybe related to FileVault in Panther.Apple support fixed the problem quickly (after I wasted three days)Panther seems quicker, sharper, and very stable - even while some applications were driving me nuts others were completely unaffected. Just wait a month or two, then enjoy."
1,Zero Stars!!!!!!!!,"Worthless trash is what my experience has been with this new operating system. I've got a PowerBook G4 and recently installed 10.3 Panther and have had nothing but trouble ever since. The first and main problem is that upon launch of an application, any application, like Word, Photoshop, Illustrator, Excel, Powerpoint, or Entourage, the application freezes during startup about 10 to 20% of the time and even force quit cannot close it, necessitating rebooting the system. I've called the Apple and Microsoft help desks, but to no avail. I didn't have any of these problems with OSX 10.2.2 and now regret changing. The enhancements are trivial for my needs. Buyer beware!"
3,No Thanks.,"I'm a musician with a home studio built around a Windows XP machine, and was looking to add an iBook to take advantage of music programs not written for Windows. I spent some time with this and other machines in an Apple store and concluded that I'll put up with Windows--and buy about 50% more laptop for the same price--rather than being straight-jacketed by this overly designed and clunky user interface. I'm one of those creative types that's not afraid of technology and am really, really demanding of flexibility in the operating system. Windows does this so much better than OS X, at least for my needs. And not having access to two buttons is the final killer. Whether on the net, in Photoshop, or in Reason, I don't want to have to hit control to bring up a contextual menu. I'm kind of shocked, since so many people rave about this OS. Huh."
5,Well worth the money!,"We've got two Macs - an 800Mhz iBook and 1Ghz Dual CPU PowerMac - so we bought the Family Pack. My wife reports that her iBook is a lot more ""snappy"" running Panther.I've only had one problem with a piece of software not working with Panther, and that is the Palm Sync application. It seems that Palm didn't bother to ensure their software would work with the new OS.As others have said, the new Expose feature is great! There are a lot of subtle improvements throughout the system, including new address book and mail features, updates to the disk utility, the file browser, the terminal...too many to mention.The search functions in the finder and email are much faster now, too.Was it worth the $200 we paid for the Family Pack? Heck yes!"
3,Tiger Instead - New Mac - New Operating System,"I guess if you needed Panther now you would buy it, but if you're not in a hurry, pre-order the Tiger Operating System (Available April 29th). It may even be cheaper than Panther, currently at $149CDN.I got Panther with my new iMac, and I like it, but Tiger has a few features I would use every day:1. Widgets - I played with Konfabulator and loved it.2. Spotlight - will really simplify finding old docs, emails, etc.3. QuickTime 7 - I'm a big fan and can't wait to see the improvements.4. TextEdit - there are some new improvements that I've been waiting for sometime, including saving documents in HTML format.Looking back and comparing it to my old machine with the Jaguar Operating System, the things that made a big impression were not necessarily to do with Pather improvements, I think it was more to dow with the new iMac itself and the prepackaged software. With Tiger, I can see there's lots for me take advantage of."
2,"Mac OS X yes, $130 no","Mac OS X is great. No disputing that. Jaguar was a real step forward. I was glad to pay $130 for that. Panther... well, Apple claims 150 great new features... but there's really only a handful that are useful... and it's a little much for them to ask for $130 again just 1 year later.Great product, but not worth the cost."
1,I'll be honest ... it's bad,"So...I bought this movie thinking, old school anime with blood, or drama or some strong plot.all I got was bad animation. so bad I could not watch the filmit's like pictures and sound, visuals are lame, story was boringinfact if you have children that need sleep let them watch thisor listen to it, the most snoozing go to sleep sound ever"
3,Average collection of above-average material,"Not the best sampling of Fish's post-Marillion work, and the boring, middle-of-the-road new tracks are not at all indicative of the direction he's taking with his upcoming _Raingods With Zippos_. But for someone who's never heard Fish before, this is the best start - an inexpensive collection of singles. But please don't judge him by ""Chasing Miss Pretty""..."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered a book through this company and waited over a month and still had not received the book. The owner said his books usually ship within 48 hours. I wrote the owner and he basically just said ""sorry"" and was going to have my credit card credited. I haven't seen that credit back yet on my credit card statement. I think doing business this way is unfortuante. He should have sent me the book ""overnight"" delivery to show good faith, as good customer service should. Instead, I just got ""sorry"".....after waiting over a month for this book I needed to give as a gift which never came. Totally disappointed."
3,Not very pleased,These cartridges gave me a problem because the printer read them as old and refused to print. After working on the printer and taking out the battery I was able to get it to print but afterwards I decided to buy a new printer. I was very disappointed in both the printer and the cartridges.
1,I Am Not Getting Another HP Printer Because of the Cartridges,"There is nothing more frustrating than HP cartridges. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. In either case, they're expensive and a hassle to return. For example, you have to make sure that the expiration date (which seems to be a gnat's lifetime) hasn't passed. Then, if you have one that hasn't expired, you may get the ""BAD PRINTER HEAD"" message. There are so many things that go wrong with HP cartridges that I am replacing my HP printer with a different brand. I'm tired of the money I'm spending on the cartridges and the time I've spent making sure that they work."
5,Works Perfectly and Doesn't Smell,"The ink came in ahead of schedule and has a good long shelf life. I've ordered ink from some sources that shipped ink that was already past the ""best if used by"" date. I'm pleased to report that the ink I received has a shelf life well over a year ahead.Another thing I appreciate about the HP ink is its lack of any odor; I've ordered refills that actually had a bad odor and smelled up the room with the printer. That is most assuredly not acceptable; since then I've been reluctant to experiment with refills and believe the extra cost is worth it when buying the HP brand.The HP ink does its job perfectly and has produced no problems with either of our HP printers."
1,Be careful,"I purchased this combo pack December 2011 - an item sold by Caught in the Web and filled by Amazon.com. However, the color cartridge had an install by date of 2008/11/08 and wouldn't work. The install by date on the outside package was conveniently covered over with a bar code sticker. What a waste of my money and time."
2,Old ink,"Although I received this ink promptly, it was old and dry. After I put it in my printer, the printer told me I must replace this ink. It was not usable. There was no problem returning it as Amazon is very good about that."
4,Breads and yummy,I make bread and its very well written and easy to understand for anyone wanting to make her own bread.
2,Didn't like the bread,"I am a rookie Breadman user, so I follow instructions closely and I get unsatisfactory loaves from the recipes I have tried from this book."
5,need more books like this,i wanted more healthy whole grain recipes and this fits the bill. i wish there were more books for breadmachine with more whole grain recipes.
5,Smart Bread machine whole grain book,I replaced an olde book I have worn out useing but dokeep you bread machine book as you need to know your achine.
5,Delicious freeze-dried fruits,"These are delicious, nutritious, convenient, no bruising, no mess, no throwing good food away because it's over-ripe. Excellent delivery time, too!"
3,easy listening organ music,"I have this CD. I enjoyed the smooth slow jazz tunes. This CD reminds me of her ""STARDUST"" album. All slow tunes and no swing tunes. On this CD it's just Rhoda on organ and a drummer. A duo. Her organ sounds mamoth due to the Leslie & Hammond speakers combination. Her selection of songs made it worth while. I just wish there was at least 1 fast song on the album."
5,"THE ""FLATOUT"" BEST BEAR YOU CAN BUY",I LOVE THIS BEAR AS DOES MY SON. WHAT A NICE UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TEDDY BEAR THAT WILL LAST A LIFETIME. IT IS MADE OF NATURAL MATERIAL NOT THE ICKY PLASTIC MATERIALS AVAILABLE IN DEPARTMENT STORES. IT IS SOFT TOO. A UNIQUE GIFT
5,Quality Stockpot,This a quality stockpot without the hefty price. I use it to make spaghetti sauce and have been very pleased. I highly recommend this product.
3,Hard to clean,"Have used this pot for over a year. This is a good, sturdy, stockpot. But it is very hard to wash/clean, compared to Revere Ware."
3,"First month great, then it stains and burns easily, thick soups do not fare well","This pan is good for thin stocks but not other purposes. I was wowed at first. I followed manufacturer directions but apparently what ever gloss like coating they put on it wears off and then it starts burning and staining fairly easily. Still good, but not as good as I would have hoped for the price. I do a lot of browning and soups that simmer on low. Simmering beans and thick soups is not a good idea with this pan. Stocks and thin liquids do fine."
5,Best barrel,"I have two of this barrels and they are great, light I don't know why ppl care about this, but it's light, accurate and beautiful!"
5,as good as human=garbage,"murder your children in the dead of night to get money from thier piggy banks, to buy this, off: (...)(i hope they give me something for my endorsement, ...ehh-hem...)"
4,excellent story,The Mustache is an excellent story with many twists and an unexpected ending. It defintely ranks highly with me in the realm of stories which make you think more than twice
2,A Yin Yang combination,"A strange contrast in stories. I liked ""Class Trip"" for Nicholas's wonderful, if not morbid, imagination. I was slighty disappointed in his lack of action but most of the story takes place in his imagination anyway. He reminded me of the character Eugene in Wolfe's ""Look Homeward Angel"" ""The Mustache"" is a Kafka-eske novella, but not as much as the plug on the back of the book sets you up for. It is bizzare none the less especially towards the odd ending where the main character feels trapped in an existenstialist world. The shift is a bit ackward and the whole idea of everyone forgotting you had once had a mustache is a large stretch. I think it would be better if his wife and friends forgot who he was/ didn't recognize him when he shaved off his mustache. His paranoia is similar to Nicolas's but much worse. I recommend reading ""Class Trip"" but save your shaving cream for a different mustache."
2,could be a lot better,"I got this for my son, who loves the movie and more the song, this book only has a few voices, and none of the actual characters, just random sounds. maybe just the penguins...the story is fine, but I was hoping for something more exciting.would not recommend buying this."
2,Soundtrack is just OK.,"I bought this mainly for the ""Move It"" song, the rest of the soundtrack is OK at best. Some songs that you would think should be on there, are not. All in all, 2 out of 5 stars."
1,No purpose to this stupid killer/ stalker movie,The production value of the movie was not bad. The acting was satisfactory . But the story was stupid even for a budget slasher film . Sometimes a bad horror film is entertaining on some level. This one is just stupid to me.Mentally ill stalker creates Hell on earth for her chosen victim. I suppose someone might like this mindless slasher/killer concept. But I simply didnt find it entertaining . The plot was WEAK from the word go and JUST got more Stupid as it went along.The basic idea is this mentally deranged killer can never go to far. I guess the idea isnt bad .....but the movie is.Id skip it as there are so many better selections out there .
1,Cores!,Wow! I can't believe 3 people gave this movie 5 stars and all on the same day! What a coincidence! Lots of core shakin' goin' on! *insert sarcastic fart noise here*
1,keith Malley is not enough,the only scenes to look forward to in this movie are Keith Malley's scenes. There are not enough scenes in this movie to make this movie good. My roommates and I watched this movie and laughed but I don't think that's what the director intended. Keith Malley is great this movie is not.
5,"Bright, energetic and lively Baroque","I really enjoy the Capella Istropolitana. They have such a wonderful and bright sound. I find the works on this CD to be well played and the tempo selection for each movement very good. I listen to Baroque on my daily commute to and from work. I have a particular affinity for Italian Baroque, so I very much enjoy listening to the man who influenced so many other composers of the period. Great CD and an invaluable addition to your Italian Baroque collection."
5,Love it!!,It is a great device.... Does what it aims to do and the extra gadgets for the price was great. Absolutely amazed...
2,Neat film - HORRIBLE english language track,"I bought this film hoping that it would be as enjoyable as ""Morozka"" - or the Snow Maiden which has a great re-dubbed english language track. (My children - ages 2-6 love it) The Golden Horns is a great film - but the english track is AWFUL! This film is NOT voiced by english speaking actors. Instead the script is read by a non-native english speaker - a russian man with a very heavy accent. This narrator makes no attempt to add interest to the film - just reads the script in a very monotone manner. A terrible shame - because this is a great russian film. It would be worth buying if they ever re-do the english track.... but for now it is just too annoying to watch in english. If you can speak russian - you will enjoy the original language track. A great folk tale - but please... re-do the english track!"
4,Great Baba Yaga tale...,"Another of Alexander Rou's classic Russian fairytale movies. A good thorough tale centered around the witch Baba Yaga. I didn't enjoy this one as much as others only because the DVD doesn't offer an English dubbed version. While I did like it very much, I hate watching highly visual movies like this with subtitles because they distract me from the action on screen. However, the upside to watching a movie subtitled allows you to hear the original actors' voices and soundtrack. An interesting story about a mother who is attempting to rescue her 3 missing children from the clutches of the evil Baba Yaga! Fantastic performance as always by Georgy Millyar as Baba!"
5,best vegan kids vitamin at the best price ive found!,"thank you so much! super fast shipping and the best price ive found, and with having three kids ill be buying often!"
5,Vegan Kids Vitamins,I didn't know what to expect. Since this was my first time getting these vitamins. I searched high and low for vegan vitamins for my kids. The kids loves them....even my autistic child loves eating them. I do hoped they could make the pills smaller and add more inside the bottle instead of just 60. I will continue to get them....until something better comes along! God Blessed!
5,VegLife - Vegan Kids Multiple Berry - 60 Chewable Tablets,Item is just as described. My kids enjoy the flavor. I am happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a vegan children's vitamin.
2,Made my kid feel really strange...,My vegetarian 4 year old reported that she felt really strange after she took these vitamins. I honestly think they gave her too much energy because she was very moody on these vitamins. I stopped the vitamins and she felt better again. She usually takes Rainbow Light Kids One Multistars and does not have any issues whatsoever. These vitamins seem like a great option for others out there.
3,"Readable, yet predictable","By 3 stars I dont mean this a terrible book.Its actually entertaining to read, speciallytowards the end. It started slowly, and getsbetter after the first 100 pages.The bad and very bad??I could predict almost every trascendental twist ofthe plot, at least 50 pages before it happened.Also, the author fails in keeping you interestedat the end of every chapter."
1,Item not as described!,"This item is not as described. The Ambient Orb, which I intended to purchase, is currently unavailable. The Market Maven is a different product from the one described in the item description. Returned for refund!"
1,Give me a Break,"At first I thought this was a joke. The more I read the more I was sure it was. What a waste of money. I especially loved the review from the guy whose life was enhanced so much by this stupid thing because he now can choose the right clothing for the weather without having to do anything ""time-consuming."" What? Like look out the window maybe? Give me a break."
3,Weather function limited to 4 cities for free,"I think it was NYC, Atlanta, Chicago and San Fran? (maybe LA?) got free updates, otherwise you needed to subscribe to the monthly fee. I was disapointed, returned it.Functionality-wise it is pretty neat, and did work well. Would consider buying it again if they added Boston to the roster of free cities."
2,Poorly designed,"While the kids love it, it's a headache for parents. It takes forever to inflate, even with an air compressor, thanks to many individual air chambers. As other reviewers noted, it's best not to leave it outside (the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage), but it's far too big to leave up inside the house. Not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down. I gave ours away."
1,William Wendt would not be Happy,"I purchased the soft cover version, 64 pages long, there are 8 color photos of Wendt's paintings and 13 black and white. I'm sorry to say, the black and white photos DON'T do his paintings justice. And the color photos of his art work in this book, AREN'T the greatest either. ...I'm NOT really impressed with it. As far as what is written about Mr Wendt in the book... well.... Topics include: California Art Club; Wendt and Stendahl, The Letters; Four Conversations on William Wendt; and a few other topics. If your looking for quality photos of Mr Wendt's art work, I wouldn't look here in this book. And if your looking for something more in-depth on the life of William Wendt, well... I'd probably look elsewhere. In conclusion, I feel I wasted [my $]."
2,No substance,"Judy seems to think that you can't teach someone to be funny but that is not true. By teaching somebody how to find humor within a topic you teach them to be funny. Comedy is not always about you and your problems either. Though you can get some good material from this, if that's all you talk about on stage then your not as good as you could be. I have researched and found very specific technical methods for digging funny material out of anything. Judy tells you if your life doesn't suck then you can't be funny. I completely disagree. Bill Gates could do standup if he wanted to."
2,Good Attempt,I don't think you can really write a book to teach someone to be funny. Fortunately the author does not even attempt that task. Judy talks a lot on the structure of jokes and setting up punch lines. I guess I have a hard time buying into this cookie cutter approach of humor. I have not yet read her latest book so I can't speak to that but I would not recommend buying this book.
2,Why did I buy this book?,"by following the methods that judy describes in this book on how to create stand up comedy material, you will probably find yourself quickly becoming a dull comic. but i guess i really wouldn't be satisfied by any book written on how to perform stand up comedy."
