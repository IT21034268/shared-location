5,Not yet finished with it but...,"What a great book! It's a real page turner and the descriptions of Washington landmarks make it hard for me to believe this is a work of fiction.This is the first book I've ever recommended to friends that I haven't yet finished. It's a good quick summer read. You'll surely enjoy it if you like suspense, mystery, and computer wars.Richard Hayman Rockville, Maryland"
1,Run away! Run Away! (to Cryptonomicon instead!),"Giving this ""Book"" the minimum 1 star is a small price to pay if it leads you to at least read a few pages of this mess before purchasing it. This goes to the bottom of the list to join such similar ilk as ""The Black Cipher"" by Harrison and ""Backslash"" by Lovejoy. The only quality computer thriller of the season appears to be Neal Stephenson's ""Cryptonomicon"", which is part ""The Gold Bug"", part ""Treasure Island"", and simply wonderful throughout! Buy ""Cryptonomicon"" instead."
4,Pretty impressed,"Cons: You cannot charge 4th generation ipods from the dock. There is no EQ, nor smartsound presets.Pros: This little box outperformed my expectations. It sounds great, even though you have to use the factory preset and can't tweak the EQ manually. It has really good power; I can turn it on in the dining room and fill the entire downstairs with clean-sounding music. There is no significant distortion when you crank up the volume.Summation: To my mind, for the money you're paying, this product is extraordinary. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Disappointed in this Phillips,"I still have an older Phillips unit that I use in my garage and it has great sound and is easy to use. This unit will only operate with the remote control, which I don't like, and I don't think it has the sound quality of sound either. I am disappointed in this model."
1,CD player is useless...,"I bought this and it plays none of the CDs which I own. I tried about 10 whether commercial, home-made or demos. The CD player on this thing fails to recognise any CD at all. The sound is a bit weedy and the bass is not that impressive."
2,Unfortunately the sound is bad!,"I agree with the first reviewer about the functionality, but the unit is acoustically awful. It sounds ok for fm, but when you play cd's or mp3's the tinny bass deficient and distorted sound are unbearable. I cannot recommend it even though I had high hopes."
4,Good product,"good product...works as described...cd/mp3/ipod/aux input, remote - good features, what i want and use...only bad say is - sound quality is not great - disappointing...the DBB (Dynamic Bass Boost) make very little difference...if the sound have been good, this product wud have been just great...also, u cannot navigate ipod menu and categories with the report - only play, stop, next, previous buttons on the remote and the player - for everything else u need to use the iPod buttons - its an inconvenience but can live with it..."
5,May be Herbert's greatest work,"I really don't understand how this work could have been so poorly received. The entire Voidship series is one of the most provocative and deeply moving works of science fiction that I have ever read. I actually found this series far more provocative than the Dune series. I don't know how much is Herbert and how much is Ransom, but this is an incredible collaboration. It is a long inquiry into the nature of existence, consiousness, and humanity. It is also a great story. It a truly original, unique work."
2,Disturbing Errore,"I eagerly awaited this book but was suprised by glaring errors and ommissions. It appears that the fact checker used, if any, had no knowldege or insufficient knowledge of Chabad officialdom over the past decade and more."
4,"""Clancy novel"" centered in the 80s oil boom","Richer Than The Rockefellers is not only a good story well told, but the richness of the language and authentic grit of the characters is a real treat. The author's experience in the oil fields comes through in many ways, but he did a particularly fine job of letting the reader experience ""life on an oil rig,"" its dangers, the men who face them, their colorful antics, and their joys and sorrows in doing this grueling and risky work. An absorbing read, several times I discovered my mouth agape and eyes wide in awe of the sheer power of the forces these men try to tame (""... the steel supports were sheared like pine boards""). The well-paced technical explanations and use of industry jargon reminded me in the best way of Tom Clancy's style. I will buy Mr. Gawthop's next book on the strength of this work alone."
2,Not user-friendly,"I have this calculator for about 1 year and the paint of the digits have completely faded away.Often when I push a button, the calculator does not respond.When you push a calculation button twice, for example +, or first push - and then +, the calculator gives an error, while other calculators would take the last entered calculation button.When you would like to see a subtotal, for example 3+5+8+ other calculators would calculate at every entry of the +. This calculator doesn't, so you have to enter = first and then do the rest of the calculation."
5,Very Nice,"This is one of Amy's albums that every one seems to forget about, which is a shame. This isn't like her recent albums like ""Heart In Motion"", ""House Of Love"", or ""Behind The Eyes"", but it is still very good, and its still Amy Grant, even though it was released in 1980 when Amy was supposedly a sophmore in college. The songs have BEAUTIFUL melodies, and beautiful production and arrangements, too (it sounds like Amy was experimenting with the synthesizer on just a few of the songs on here, which isnt a bad thing at all). There are songs that have a happiness to them (""Look What Has Happened To Me"", ""Don't Give Up On Me""), that are moving and very deep (""All I Ever Have To Be"", ""Thats The Day"", ""If I Have To Die"", ""So Glad"") and songs that are just winnning songs (""Walking Away With You"", ""It's A Miracle""). This is a true christian album, and Amy performs these songs with honesty, and emotion. If you are a fan of christian music, or a fan of Amy's, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS! :-)"
3,Take my hand precious Lord,"Bewarned, ""Take my hand precious Lord"" which I think is the standout track on ""Beans and fatback"" has been replaced by ""Backwoods preacher man""."
4,"Not the best Link, but still great.","This CD is somewhat of a puzzlement. Those who expect the raving Link of old will find little to please them here. HOWEVER, this is an exceptional collection nonetheless. As stated in the item description, this 2 CD set is comprised of three LPs. The Link Wray LPs focus on much more of a rootsy country-folk sound, showcasing how much can be done with so little. The ""Mordacai Jones"" LP brings up memories of some of the steel guitar tracks on George Harrison's ALL THINGS MUST PASS, while Jones' voice is an entrancing cross between a twenty-something Willie Nelson and Grand Funk's Mark Farner. Link plays all kinds of stuff on all three LPs, including bass, dobro, steel guitar (showing off all kinds of sides of Link not usually in the limelight), and a precious amount of the trademark Linkified down and dirty electric guitar. Not for everyone, but still great. It's sort of in a class by itself."
4,unbelieveable,"I seriously doubt many folks will find their way to this record set (it's basically 3 albums in one). The ones that do will be blown away and questions, again, why music like this never saw popularity originally. This record fits perfectly alongside recent trends of unearthing late 60's and 70's underground music like Rodriguez, Dennis Wilson, etc. The standouts here are the down home funk of Jukebox Mama, the apocalyptic rock of Fire and Brimstone, and the road burning blues of Tail Dragger. Link Wray proved his might with Rumble and showed on these albums that he never really lost that well referenced originality."
5,Amazing STUDY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT,"ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITZIN IS MAYBE THE BEST WRITER/NOVELIST/HISTORIAN OF THE 20TH CENTURY.I was initially fearful that this would be tough read, but it read very smoothly. It was exciting, full of suspense,pathos. His characters are very realistic. Many of them endure horrible suffering. Many overcome their troubles. Some ruin their lives by doing the right thing, by doing good, by thinking beyond their own narrow worlds. This book is very inspiring. But it is also very funny in spots. Some situations are unbelievably clever in their humor. (the visit of Eleanor Roosevelt to the prison and the guard having the prisoners all spiffed up for the occasion. The trial of Prince Igor according to the stalinist regime.) THE STORY DEPICTS LIFE IN RUSSIA UNDER STALIN.I LOVED THIS BOOK, A REAL PAGE TURNER."
4,the first circle,"I'm a sucker for all of Solahenitsyn's books, have read this one and the First Circle at least twice, and will read them again."
3,Would be 5 stars if shipped as described-bait and switch,"Great Slant Rack. Description says 12U describing the Vertical size but Amazon has a typo Road Runner did not respond to calls or emails. Product is actually supposed to read ""../2U"". So the height of this case is 2U NOT 12U. So I can't load anything but a 1U size rack mount device besides the mixer. Still the best value for the money but it has been annoying trying to figure out why I did not receive the 12U high case I was expecting. Music123 was the vendor and they were awesome to deal with but they only carry this product in a 2U high configuration.If someone orders this and gets a 12U mixer case please post it here so I can get mine. I have opted to keep the 2U high unit and get another rack case for the other gear"
4,A good biography of the actor Robert Shaw,"This is a biography of the actor (Jaws, From Russia with Love, etc.), playwright, novelist and sometime singer Robert Shaw. Unfortunately, I got the last copy, but I recommend hunting this volume down if you're interested in Shaw. Highly underrated for most of his life, his work was truly art and his quirky personality makes for good storytelling, at which French more often than not succeeds. Fans of his acting will be surprised to find out some of the well-researched factoids about this jack-of-all-trades. The reader will be surprised at how well French demonstrates that Shaw's short life was exciting, yet nearly wasted. (There is another bio of Shaw, ""Robert Shaw: More Than a Life"" by Georg Gaston.)"
4,The Brilliance of Menuhin,This CD was the first I ever heard of the great Menuhin. It was right when I first started listening to violin music. At first I didn't like it. In parts of the Beethoven and MendelssohnMenuhin used very wide vibrato and tended to sound out of tune. I returned it to my local library. About sixth months later I deceide to give it another go. Since my taste had matured I loved this CD. HE didn't play out tune at all and his tone is beautiful. The more I listen to Menuhin the more I love him.
3,A comment about the Brahms,"This recording of the Brahms concerto is one Menuhin made later in life. It is almost painful to listen to. Menuhin has technical problems and sound like he's working very hard in passages where the music should flow easily -- and does flow easily in his earlier recording with Furtwangler. Only occasionally does the passionate artist rise out of the challenged technician and take my breath away -- a passage here and there, but not enough to make it a worthwhile experience. For this particular work, as well as for the Beethoven, I strongly recommend getting EMI's release of the early 1950's Menuhin/Furtwangler performances -- soul-searching, fluid, inventive, and awe-inspiring."
3,Funky &#65533;Big Band&#65533; Dance Mood Lacks Intensity,"After listening to Robbie Robertson's dramatic and passionate self-titled solo debut (1987), `Storyville' is a letdown. `Hold Back The Dawn' is a beautifully mysterious piece, and `What About Now' is an inspiring soulful ""live for today"" anthem. I also enjoy the majestic determination of `Breakin The Rules.' `Sign Of The Rainbow' is both tender and gorgeous. `Storyville' features plenty of alluring and mysteriously enchanting work, but missing are the potent rockers with the foreboding danger of Robertson's previous effort. `Go Back To Your Woods' is a funky dance tempo number, heavy on horns, but light on emotional impact. The dance tempo is repeated again on `Shake The Town.' The song might get the townsfolk on the dance floor, but ""shake"" is a far reach. Overall, `Storyville' stands well on its own merits, buts its funky ""big band"" dance mood is no substitute for the power and intensity of Robertson's previous effort."
5,Second best album of all-time behind Dark Side of the Moon,"What can I say, my title says it all! This is a masterpiece. It's a shame how Robbie Robertson is hardly mentioned by critics and by the younger kids. I asked a 20+ girl if she had a used RR CD and she said, ""Who's Robbie Robertson? Back to the CD if you like classic rock, and want your music to challenge you, this will do unlike almost no other album ever created. Incredible!"
3,"Great songwriting, but needs Levon Helm and Rick Danko","The Band was the quintessential example of synergy in pop music. Robbie Robertson wrote wonderful songs, Levon and Rick sang them, and the unique sound cemented by Garth Hudson made them probably the best band of the late 1960s and 1970s. Well at least they were my favorite band from that era.This album has songs equally as good as the songs Robertson wrote for The Band, which is saying a lot. And when you hear Rick Danko's back up vocals on this album, you can't help but feel that the vocal roles should be swapped. I'm not one for nostalgia, but this album invokes feelings that this could well be the best Band album ever if only...That said, someone should cover some of these songs, because the songwriting is first rate."
1,Storyville,when I recieved it iwas broken. Can I get anew one?The cd storyville was brokenCan I be compensated?Katie sauve
5,My Favorite Disc - Ever,"Just an indescribable masterpiece that's easily on par with Dark Side Of The Moon. I have given this to countless people who later ask me ""Who IS this guy?!!!"". Great songs, amazingly well produced, with Robertson's voice and guitar adding the perfect blend of warmth and mystery (struggling to find the words here...). Turn your stereo WAY up and try NOT to get goosebumps as you listen to tunes like Soap Box Preacher, What About Now, and Hold Back The Dawn. You can't do it. You just can't do it. This is moody, vibrant, passionate music that deserves a serious sit-down-and-LISTEN. Whoever said ""turn out the lights and listen"" nailed it on the head. You don't know how good your stereo is until you listen to this one.So, I like it."
2,Like a Centaur Without the Horse,"Carson has such a prodigious command of style and form that one is tempted to overlook the lack of passion and humanity in these poems. After initial enthusiasm I increasingly felt oppressed by this claustrophobic book, which evokes an apophatic language of transcendence to articulate what I take to be Carson's difficulty in making contact with her own animal nature. The intellect is depicted as a point of departure, but it leads only to alienation. Humans pass through this book like the shades of the Odyssey who generate speech but not warmth. Sexuality estranges, never unites.It's a rather dismal view of life, and one that does not impress me. It strikes me as the work of a writer who would rather read of the rage of Achilles than stake her own heart in the bungled human comedy.Carson is the greatest translator of Sappho that one can imagine, and in matters of elegant expression she lacks nothing."
5,wonderful,"my two year old loves everything about the backyardigans. he already had the ty pablo, and for his birthday i ordered the rest of the ty backyardigans(tyrone, tasha, uniqua, and austin.) he plays with them everyday, even though he has all of the backyardigan toys. they are made great and, the ty toys are the only backyardigan toy set that has tasha avaliable in it."
1,Very dissapointing!!!...,I bought Tasha and Austin from another seller and they were pretty cute and decent size but unfortunately this ones are much more smaller!!! and the colors aren't as bright as they look in the pictures. My daughter notices the difference between this ones (I bought Pable and Tyrone) and Tasha and Austin.Ty Beanie Buddie - Austin - Backyardigans BuddyTy Beanie Buddie - Tasha - Backyardigans Buddy
3,Backyardigans Doll,I bought this for my son because he loves the Backyardigans. Unfortunately it's seen the bottom of our toy box a couple times. I thought he would never let it go but it's just not fun. It's just a stuffed animal. And a little smaller than I anticipated. Great for kids who like stuffed animals though.
4,Good toy,"The kids will enjoy it this toy, is durable materials. Good size and handle. Kids under five (5) years old probably love it."
5,Excellent Tyrone Toy,"This toy is excellent. It looks even cutter than the cartoon characters and it's very well finished and also seems durable.Besides, it comes well packaged and shipped in a timely fashion.About the Educational rate, I selected a low value because it does not seeem to me that this kind of dolls could be so educational, it like playing with a Barbie, the toy itself does not carry the same educational content as the cartoon series could offer."
4,grandson loves them,"purchased for grandson's 1st birthday and he now has noticed the dolls are like the TV show. he hugs them , but is too young to play with them by himself. I hope he interacts with them more as he grows."
5,Videos do not get better than this one,"This DVD is simply unbelievable from start to finish and is a MUST HAVE if you like Snoop, Dre, Cube and Eminem. It never stops giving you chills. The quality of this video is OUTSTANDING. It is shot in a special 35mm format that gives so much clarity that this concert video looks better than most studio-made videos! (don't listen to those who say the cuts are too fast...sit back and watch Dre and Snoop tear down the house!"
5,Up In Smoke,"I would give this DVD 5 stars. If you attended the concert, you got to see it again, how they tore it up on the stage. If you missed the concert you get to see it all, up close and personal. You have all the best rappers of al time on stage together also. You have Dr.Dre, Snoop, Nate Doog, Warren G, Eminem, Ice Cube, Xzibit, Kurupt, Mack 10, and the list goes on. This video is worth buying."
3,"Hmm, well the sound ....","I'm a fan of Snoop, Dre, Ice Cube and Eminem. I bought the DTS Version because I was looking for great sound. If you are looking for phatt basses, this DVD won't suit you. Coz the people shouting during the concert is quite loud. These sounds will be brought by the two back loudspeakers ( some scratches too). On some tracks you won't hear Dre and the vocals are not very clear, because the shouting is so loud. For me, this DVD was a deception, coz the sound is not ""as heard"" on a normal CD and the most annoying thing : the people shouting in my back, no real sound volume and phatt basses. Ok it's a live DVD, but the sound could have been better that's why I gave just 3 stars. Perhaps this DVD is only ment for real ""hard"" fans."
3,Keep It Gangsta Yo. Keep It Gangsta. Buy It Now!!,"This is a great DVD for those who (like me) love Gangsta Rap/Hip Hip. Dre, Ice Cube, Snoop Dog, Eminem, Mack 10, WC their all here baby. However, my one big disapointment with this 'Up In Smoke Tour' is the almost minor role given to my main man, Ice Cube. I mean, he only performes 4 of is tracks while Snoop, Dre and Eminem get the chunk of the limelight. Whats that all about? It aint fair for us Cube fans. Because of this, I have decided to give it 3 Stars. But Buy It anyway and check out WC's C Walk (It almost Steals the show alone)."
3,NO DTS,"transfer is great, nice behind the scenes, awsome concert.. but NO DTS????? it says in the box and in the disc but in the menu is not available dont get FOOLED."
3,there is no DTS on DVD,"Tour is super, great tracks but no DTS sound, although on the dvd box it (DTS sound) typed with big letters."
3,it was ok,"this movie was alright, i maen the best part of it was Dub C's C-walk....it was supposed to be west coasts biggest stars but they showed all kinds of eminem instead of warren g, TQ, and the eastsidaz...where the were they? why did they get cut out???? if they were on it it would get a 5. oh and tupac wouldnt have been on this show because of his beef with dre"
4,GOOD BUT NEEDS MORE BEHIND THE SCENES,I thought it was a great DVD but I wish it would have featured more behind the scenes. I went to an advance screening last night of Xzibit's upcoming DVD Restless Xposed and it featured more behind the scenes than concert footage which allowed me to get to know who Xzibit is.... I wish the Up In Smoke was more like that but it is still a great DVD and a should have for your collection...
5,The greatest Hip Hop Tour of all time comes to your house!,"What can you say about this DVD/Video?-Its Da Bomb! With Dre and Snoop its already gonna be great, but throw in Xzibit, Ice Cube and a bunch of other great hip-hop artists, you have the makings of the greatest Hip-Hop DVD/Video of all time. A definite buy. You won't regret being ""Up in Smoke""!"
5,BEST RAP CONCERT EVER,"This Concert Has: Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube & Eminem. It Also Has Guest Performances And/Or Footage Of: MC Ren, Warren G, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, Kurupt & Many More. This DVD Is A Must-Have For Any West-Coast Rap Fan."
2,Slice and Dice Editing,"The Amazon reviewer called the editing on this DVD ""slice and dice editing"", I would call it ""very bad editing"". I really liked the show and would have liked to have watched it but the rapid fire editing made it maddening. In most of the concert footage the scene changes were as quick as every one second and rarely did a shot last longer than two seconds. So your jerking around so much you can't watch the show. It is very distracting!"
4,Great DVD!,"Ok, first off, I have to say that I was a bit surprised and shocked at all the female nudity in this DVD...so just to warn anyone who is offended by stuff like that, you might not like this. Other than that, the DVD rocks and I would still recommend it to others.You definitely get your moneys worth. It's well over 2 hours long, with lots of bonus features and behind-the-scenes. More Em & Cube would have been nice though.As stated in previous reviews, the 2 second cuts do exist, however most of them are well timed and flow together, creating an animated, action style. Don't let that discourage you from purchasing this DVD. Sit back, relax and enjoy!!!"
3,Make sure Dvd is not in PAL Format.,"Bought this DVD new for my PS3 or My new Samsung 3D blu ray player. Did not play in either one. Only reason why i bought the dvd is so i didnt bootleg it off the net and i can get tru 1080i upconversion on my 60"" Led. Anyways short story is Most New players only accept NtSF and not Pal. The Seller did make it right and gave me a refund. Rate, Respond."
1,titles?,How does a company offer a CD for $71.22 and not even bother to list the titles of the works recorded? I do not recommend buying anything that does not disclose full information about what you are buying.
3,Not quite what I had expected!,"I, too, was a little disappointed in this book. I was expecting a little more information on the hows and whys of signing with your baby. I like the colorful pictures and it will be fun to play some of the recommended games. There is pretty much only a page or two of text in this book. Anyone who is looking for any information other than the 15 or so signs it teaches should not buy it."
2,It's Got It All......,"Meredith Layton has done essentially a fine job with this toy. The description of ""Baby's First Words"", however, as a book is exaggerated. The actual information about communicating with your child using signs is non-existent. As a toy or a 'board book', it seems very useful. Its compact size and portability mean it will likely be available to Nadira's proud parents anywhere we take her. The limited and unexplained 'activities list' on one quick page of the book have yet to be tested.Again, this 'board book' has it all.....except information."
5,A classic adventure story,"It's been more than thirty years since I first read ""Lydia Bailey"" and I'm glad to see it available again after years out of print. Kenneth Roberts was a terrific writer and he has a terrific story to tell, with action ranging from New England in the early 1800's, to Haiti during Toussaint L'Ouverture's rebellion, to the Barbary Coast. This novel is a little bit detective story, a whole lot of rousing adventure and just the right amount of romance, mixed in with plenty of pointed observations along the way about political shenanigans and the highs and lows of human nature. They really don't write 'em this way any more--which is a shame. Very highly recommended!"
5,Sears Lawn Tractor Belt,"This belt appears to be an excellent product - I have not installed it yet. The quality seems to be better than the Sears original. The cost, including shipping from ""AMC Parts Store"", for this belt and another ordered belt ordered for the same lawn tractor were less than either belt would have been directly from Sears. The belts were received in about 3 days even though the shipper was about 3000 miles away suing standard shipping. I would gladly order again from this same supplier."
2,Travel/camp pillow,I'm afraid this is not much of a pillow. May be o.k. for a small child. Way too small for an adult!
4,Laughs and Love.,"Ever since CIA agent Kelvin Kapone dove into Isabel Stanley's borrowed car ahead of a barrage of bullets, she has found herself in lust with Kel, in demand by male friends, and in danger from mysterious enemies.Funny tale of a spy and a cockroach cartoonist, with a dollop of mystery mixed in. Should appeal to romance readers, cozy mystery readers and fans of the old television series SCARECROW AND MRS. KING."
5,Very fun read!,"If you like comedy, romance, and adventure this is a book for you. It is pure pleasure to read. Pauline Baird Jones is a master of wit and plot twists and untwists. It is especially satisfying for those tired of cookie cutter genre fiction. Her humor and her plots are fresh and upbeat, and her fiction reminds me of 21st century P.G. Wodehouse. Definitely a page turner and kept me laughing!"
5,Terrific interactive potential in this fun story,"Kids will love seeing the power of the imagination in this tale. The big sister, Morgan, keeps seeing more danger for her little sister, and a bystander thinks of (and draws) a solution. Finally, Morgan thinks of the final rescue. I have read this to groups and at home, and the kids listen and look carefully to see each new dilemma crop up. They all cry ""Help, Help, Help!"" and call out the new calamity. I could see a teacher using this to introduce a creative writing and/or drawing unit, where each child could suggest what happens next in a group story. Loads of fun here!"
3,Sweet Anthony Newley!,"I remember seeing this movie when I was 12 and loving it. Now, 42 years later I've finally gotten to see it again (thanks, Amazon!). It is certainly dated with some rather odd dialogue and stilted acting by a few of the supporting actors, and it didn't tug on my heartstrings the way I remember it did all those years ago, but it is such a delight to get to watch Anthony Newley that I didn't care. Worth watching on a rainy Sunday..."
4,"Great movie, although a little pricey","This is one of my all-time favorite movies! I already had it on VHS, but was excited to buy it on DVD. While I am glad I purchased it, I am still cringing when it comes to the price and what I paid for it - a little pricey. None the less, this is a classic!"
2,ouch,"I watched this to see how it would compare to the remake which I found tolerable being a sucker for the somewhat sappy.Even allowing for the different styles of the different era (excruciating musical score for one instance) Newley's teddy boy stove pipe pants and Sandy Dennis sack dress, this still underwhelmed. Newley's strange mincing mannerisms render him absurd as the male lead. Keanu in this sense is in fairness the logical heir to the role but easily outdoes Newley in overall appeal.Charmwise-Sandy Dennis is roughly equal to Theron although her feyness is intense and unrelenting which I suppose played better then than now.If the latest version is perhaps a B or B-, this is a D charitably. The male lead is a mystery of casting and an F-.Save your time and money."
5,Susun Weed Fan,I have enjoyed the wisdom of Susun Weed for many years. She is truely a wise woman and her knowledge is from years of actual experience. I would love to take a class with her one day. In the mean time I will savor her books.
4,Okay herbal book,"This book was just okay. It went over a few herbs, but not in a very focused way. The good point is that she shows you how to use the herbs rather than telling you to purchase an already made salve/tincture/etc. If this book included more herbs it would be a lot better."
2,"Some great lessons, but too much religion included","I suffered through the first third of this book, wondering if there might be some pertinent information. It was just her personal belief system which she has interwoven with the use of herbs. While I will agree that I believe that we have gotten out of touch with our bodies as they pertain to the earth. I don't espouse bleeding into the earth during your period in order to do it! (she does, by the way) What I did glean was that a good way to learn about herbs would be to focus on just one herb-learn all about it, and what it can do. (don't sleep with it, as she suggests) I think just having it in your kitchen and garden and using it regularly would do. Starting on page 86 with Burdock, she walks you through harvesting and using the herb. This is useful and informative and I'm sure I will utilize it quite a bit. All in all, I suggest that unless you worship women and the earth-then skip the first half and go straight to using the herbs."
3,A somewhat informative mass of confusion,"Although there is some useful and straightforward information in this book, it is mainly a rambling description of the beliefs of the author. For those who are so inclined, I'm sure it will appeal to many, but if you want a practical book on herbal healing, this is not for you."
5,Back to Basics,"This is a wonderful book filled with wisdom and love. The author has presented the reader with a simple, clear cut, and hands on approach to herbalism. The reader is presented with the 3 traditions of healing, scientific, heroic, and wisewoman. After reading this book I decided to get involved in naturopathic medicine and stay clear of the scientific and heroic traditions of healing. Susun Weed has such an apporach to her writing, reading the book makes you feel like she is by your side guiding your hand as you prepare your simples. This is truly a book to cherish through out the years."
2,No Room for Imitations,"This CD asks the musical question, ""What's the difference between homage and ripoff""? If you're Wallace Roney, the answer is--not much. This disc would more appropriately have been entitled, ""I wish I were Miles Davis"". I can just picture a young Roney practicing his horn surrounded by Miles posters and paraphenalia perfecting his imitative technique.There's nothing on this disc that you can't find, done much better, by Miles in any of his electric sessions. Granted, I don't write jazz reviews for the New York Times, but I am a serious collector and listener of jazz music and to my ear, there is nothing new here. I defy the average jazz fan to find a unique voice here.The technique is excellent to be sure, and the imitation is spot on, but if you want Champaign, why drink sparkling cider? Spend your CD dollar wisely, go to the Miles Davis section, and avoid [poor] imitations."
5,What a Guy!,"We first discovered Buck Howdy when he played a benifit concert at my children's school last year. He donated his time as a fund raiser for our school. My kids and I had a blast listening and danceing to his music. We purchased his CD's that night. My kids (ages 8, 6 and 3) continue to love listening to his music. We were lucky enough to have him back last week and I made sure to tell my neighbors. They came and loved his music as much as we do. Thank you Buck for your generosity."
5,I love it,I'm a kid at heart and when I first heard Buck Howdy I knew that my kids would love him as well. I was right.
5,Buck Howdy Rocks!!!,"Buck Howdy is the only CD I have ever bought my kids that I havn't wanted to run through the paper shredder after a few days. The music is fantastic, wholsome, and 100% bearable"
4,A good source for people who want to know more about I.B.,"This book is well-written and explains the different businesses and roles of investment banks. Mr. Bloch brings down to earth complex topics such as IPO's, Venture Capital, Underwritings and other investment banking subjects. Though it hasn't been updated, the book contains a lot of information about the core issues of investment banking. Also, there is an excelent description of the evolution of the investment banking business and how technology, changes in regulations and the increasing power of institutions has changed the investment banking landscape. The book is very helpfull because Mr. Bloch uses a clear language to explain investment banking subjects and he avoids excesive use of jargon. The reader must take into account that though it's a great book, the investment banking lanscape has changed a lot since the 90's."
5,One of the best history novels out there.,"I have read this book when i was about 16. I read the book in Czech and it was incredible. Why is it out of print!? I wanted to buy an English copy for my friends to read!Bring it back! More people should read this book, its a gem."
5,Sinuhe the Egyptian,I read this book 7 years ago and still think that this is one of the best books I've ever read.
5,The most fascinating book I have ever read,"I have read the Persion (Farsi) translated version of this book. Every event/issue in this book is relevant in this modern world. Human nature has not changed a bit for the last 4000 years. But I have qyestions! Can anybody tell me wether Sinuhe did exist or not, wether all the events in this novel based on his memoirs which were found during excavations early in this century. Please let me know by an email."
5,Excellent product,"The part was shipped promptly and was the correct part. So far as I know, Timken bearings are the best available. IT takes years to find out if this prticular one is really good."
2,didn't like it,I was hoping for a comb similar to the Champion Hard Rubber 43t which it was not. I was not good for backcombing as I had hoped.
1,Danner Carbon Pond 1000,"Although the product is good, the distributor/dealer is misleading the consumer. When originally viewed three (3) filters are shown and there is a ""(3)"" shown next to the product image. What I received was one carbon filter. Amazon was made aware of this also and to no avail. Therefore,buyer beware of misleading dealers!"
2,OK - not a lot of light.,"We bought this product, and kind of wish we hadn't. The light is not very helpful for my husband - we are going to install a light in the ceiling fan, and think it will be much better. Also, the battery that it came with didn't work....it just isn't a great product - I would rather pay more for something that works."
4,a little extra,bought this just to try and it worked pretty well made things last quite a bitt longer had no complaints from my wife just use 15 min. before because she said it stung her and don't spray too much cause it will make you unable to do much at all for a while and thats no fun
1,I didn't got this product,I need my money back... because until now I didn't got this product... I waiting so long time to got this product
2,Stud 100,Stud 100 does not work at all atleast for my Husband. He used it and it didnt do what it was ment to do
1,Disappointing,This product didn't work for me. I felt no difference in the sensitivity after applying it.
1,for me the worst,its the worst i try never ever not working may be with another people work better its burn too some times
2,go_figure,"Just like the Stallion, it doesn't work.Doesn't do a darn thing to make you last longer. That's probably why it comes in a package of 3, with no option to buy just one. They know that you will not be a return customer, so get as much money as they can the 1st time."
5,works great,This product is just what I need. Not every time but when the wife is feeling really frisky a couple of shots and away we go. She is happy and I am really happy. Works great.
4,Great Product,The product works great. If you are really sensitive use more than 5 to 6 sprays. Any more than that and you can not feel any sensation at all.
2,Dud Stud,"Not much to say about this product. It does desensitize but you really have to put alot on, not the 3 pumps like they say."
2,Did not work for me,"This product, when applied, created a somewhat burning/tingly sensation that was supposed to act as a numbing agent. It became more a distraction which also left the penis skin with a strange dry texture. Overall, it did not numb as it said it would. Would not buy it again. Threw it out after the first session."
4,Real Stud Desensitizer,"I found this product through Google. I bought a pack of three but only one came. After talking with Amazon, Amazon gave me a full refund. It worked really good. It really endures my sex time."
2,"It desensitizes. It also really ""heats"", feeling very uncomfortable","In addition to desensitization, I also feel heat - but not of the good, welcoming kind, more of a chemical burn. It's also definitely not something to be used without a condom, as your partner will feel unpleasant effects as well. Another product I've tried does not produce that sensation. Won't buy this again."
3,"Effective product, but.....","This product worked as described, but my only complaint about it is that it doesn't absorb into the skin. It sprays on, and stays there (even tried to massage it in), and it has a very aerosolish smell."
4,It does work!,For those out there that need a little help this is the product for you. My advise with this product is not to get carried away your first time out. Start out with one spray and go from there. This stuff can make you go from rock hard to a limp biscuit if you spray too much on. If you do put to much on the romance will be gone for a couple of hours. Once you figure out how much works for you put it on 10 minutes before show time all the way up to 2 hrs before and then get ready to show your loved ones whats really on your mind. One other important thing to do before showtime is to take some water and wash off the sprayed area. That will get rid of any after taste but won't affect your play on the field. It will make you a new man!
4,Actually Works!,"I first saw this product at a sex shop near where I live while browsing with my fiance. The price deterred me from getting it as it was priced at $20 for such a small bottle. When I got home an checked on amazon I was quite pleased to find it was priced at about half! So I bought it, an gave it try.Next time me an the old lady got down an dirty she astonished at how much longer I lasted! She said and I quote ""I think I'm going to have to train for a marathon now!"".Overall I was quite pleased with this product and would defiantly buy it again!"
2,sometimes you win sometimes you loose.,I did not like it it did not work for me. I only use the suggested amount maybe if i apply more it may work. It just was not what i expected.
5,Good,This is exactly what I needed. Gives you more pleasure and helps you stay focused. You still can feel everything with this spray.
2,not so good,"these a not the quality I usually get a Sears, they make a very rough cut ,although they didnt break , i will not purchase again"
4,A MUST-OWN FOR EVERY 20TH CENTURY SURVIVOR,"I can't decide whether ""We're History"" belongs on my bookshelf next to ""Only Yesterday"" and ""The Crucial Decade"" or in the cabinet where I keep ""Scrabble"" and ""Monopoly."" As with his previous works, Mr. O'Neill has produced a thoroughly delightful volume which at once captures the author's astute observations about this century and presents a compendium of challenging and entertaining quizzes that test our memories of the people and events that have shaped our lives. The questions alone will provide hours of fun and nostalgia for get-togethers of friends, a couple looking for better entertainment than television, or an individual whiling away a rainy afternoon. O'Neill's ""We're History"" is a must-own for every ""20th Century Survivor."""
2,Forgettable,"It is quite amusing to read the above editorial review and find Kick Up the Dust compared with masterpieces like The Gun Club's Fire of Love, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' Tender Prey and Neil Young's On the Beach. This album is in fact nowhere close to those great works. This album is quite forgettable and sounds like wanna-be alt-country. Not to mention the singer's voice sounds similar to Conor Oberst's which I find to be very annoying. The lyrics and horrible as well. If you want indie-cred, buying this album will probably make you seem cool. If you want good music and songs, stay away from this one."
4,Another reminder Blind Guardian is the best in the genre,"I have been really enjoying this new release by BG. I was first introduced to Guardians back in '89 when they came out with Batallions and I have been carefully following their progress. In my opinion this album is not as good as Tales or Far Beyond and it is not even close to being as awesome as Imaginations but at the same time almost every song on it is very good, some are excellent but not spectacular. I think that any BG fan would enjoy this release. I hope there's more to come."
3,Queenlike Melodic Metal,"Not bad, but not up to their standards. There's One great song - Otherland, which still isn't close to their magnum opus, ""And Then There Was Silence,"" but what is? A couple of other very good songs, Fly and The New Order but after those there's nothing special. Previous albums were as good or better than this one. Diehard Blind Guardian fans should love it though. 3.35 stars."
4,Not bad but not the best,"Blind Guardian wanted a more simpler sound compared to A Night at the Opera because of the difficulty of performing the songs live. So this was the result - more simplified vocal layers and guitars - a little less epic but still powerful and heavy. Hansi's voice still shines as well. I think this is probably one of BG's darker albums, and sounds a bit more closer to conventional heavy metal rather than power metal but overall does not stray the listener away from the band being ""Blind Guardian."" This is still a pretty solid CD that hardcore Blind Guardian fans may want to give a chance."
4,Something is not right,"But I dont know what it is! There are good songs and there are bad songs.3,5/5"
4,Who Killed Bill Malloy? (Week One),"Sheriff Patterson investigates the recent death of Bill Malloy. Burke Devlin claims that Bill had information that may clear Burke of his decade manslaughter charge...Roger Collins and Sam Evans deny any knowledge of such information.The highlight of the tape for me, and the reason I give this volume four stars, is Sam Evans' tale, reluctantly told, of Burke's manslaughter charge...as told to Victoria Winters and Maggie Evans."
3,advice,"I conceived that this device would be able to provide two sources of DSL Ethernet connection too. I live in a bldg that provides DSL to all residents.I learned that to enable me to connect both my computer and a Roku device for streaming Netflix films to my TV I had to get a device called a ""workgroup switch."" Linksys is a recommended brand for this. Originally I was told I'd need an Internet Router. It turns out that if the bldg set up has a central control room with DSL Internet access, it probably also has the modem and router effects there, and thus all that the individual apartment requires is the switch. The switch has several to many ports depending on the model one gets."
1,"Network Pair Splitter, 10base-T, Cat5, Single","This was not what I thought it was supposed to do. I was disappointed with it. Since it didn't cost a lot, I didn't bother to send it back."
3,Doesn't Really Work,I bought two of these just like it says to do. Only on side worked. It did not allow me to put 2 computers on a network simultaneously. I even joined two ports on the switch with the one splitter.
3,THIS IS NOT A PAIR,"It says pair in the title, but it is only one. You NEED a pair to make the split connection work. Not sure why they would only sell one, instead of the pair. This is VERY misleading. VERY disappointed."
4,Truly exciting,"While the Böhm Ring may be music to &quot;think&quot; to, this Furtwängler Ring is music to dance to. This doesn't mean that this performance appeals superficially. Far from it. Even with the poorer sound quality (though better than his 1950 La Scala performance) than Böhm's, Furtwängler brings out all the important details of Wagner's masterpiece and puts them right in front of your nose. You don't have to concentrate too hard. You bathe in this luxury provided uniquely by this master. The exciting passion and drama of this performance come without blotting out the essential depth of Wagner's music (as sometimes happens with Solti, for example.) Which is what makes you want to dance. Thrilling stuff."
4,Entertaining,"Best Jim Carrey movie in quite awhile. Zooey Deschanel is so easy to watch. This movie isn't meant to reflect real life characters, but it is entertaining, a feel good movie without any nasty characters."
4,Yes Man is very good!,"This movie was much funnier than expected. Its funnier than other movies with a similar concept (such as the invention of lying). I don't remember this in theaters so I imagine it didn't do well but its great and everyone should give the DVD a shot. Jim Carey is his normal silly self but not too off the wall to make it unbelievable in this one. We are very selective with the DVD's we buy , this is one we will be adding to our collection.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
4,One of Carrey's better movies.,"I'm really surprised here.I really liked this movie.A lot of Carrey's movies, well.....stink.This one didn't.I'll make it short.What did I like?Lots of humor without relying on insulting the audience.The acting, directing all get a passing grade.The film is similar to ""Liar Liar"".""Liar"" probably being the better of the two.An all around great story.Carrey has to say yes to everything.It leads to some genuinely funny moments.What didn't I like?Nothing really.The story like I said is funny, it's paced well.Not too long, not too short.""Yes Man"" comes,Recommended."
4,Fun enough,"There is nothing unexpected from the film, but Carrey delivers a good blend of drama and comedy (far more of the latter). Good background chatter kind of movie given it's fairly episodic."
4,Funny,"Good movie. Sort of dragged part way through, but plenty of laugh out loud moments. Watched it with two girls, 11 and 13 and there were a couple of moments when I cringed, but it wasn't exactly wildly inappropriate."
2,Time for new Scriptwriters in Hollywood,"Basically, Yes Man is a rip-off of Liar,Liar, so I won't bother you with the transparent attempt to recycle the script using a different situation. Not only that, but unlike Liar, liar, the script itself was terrible. There was nothing Carey could have done to salvage such bad material other than write it himself. Why he accepted the project at all is beyond me. It was embarrassing, really, and I love Carey's work...which is why it got the two stars."
4,"The era of ""yes"" has begun.","This film was really well done. It's funny and sweet, has some quite smart lines, and both Carrey and Deschanel were great. They had obvious chemistry and both brought a level of physical comedy to the story that couldn't have been found in the script. The story manages to be satirical without being sarcastic. One thing that distracted me a bit was the glaring age difference between Carrey and Deschanel. It wasn't a big enough bump that it affected the plot, though. Well done!"
1,Totally Worthless,"This movie is totally stupid and not funny at all. I remember seeing Liar!Liar! at the theatre and the whole place was laughing throughout. Luckily I was smart enough to wait for this one to come out on DVD, but still I had high hopes because most of Carrey'movies are pretty hilarious and the previews looked pretty funny. WRONG! This movie stinks I couldn't watch after about half-way through. The gags aren't funny, the plot is typical and the characters are not likeable. Particularly, I thought his boss character was really stupid and unfunny. I liken this movie to 40 Year-Old Virgin which I also thought was terrible and I turned off half-way through, not funny. I am truly shocked there are people who actually gave this good reviews (though it is clear many think as I do - don't even waste your time on this movie)."
1,Just not funny,He's back but I wish he would have stayed away. This is a very tired concept and hardly original. Jim Carrey should retire. He has nothing to offer but what has been seen before. Save your money and rent something else.
1,A rare miss from Amazon Reviewers,"I normally base a lot of my purchase on what the consensus on Amazon says as it provides a lot better feedback than a reviewer, but frankly this movie was horrible.I was expecting a ""Liar Liar"" knockoff with a few less laughs. Instead it was a worn out and old looking Jim Carey who I'm pretty sure didn't even read the script.Horrible movie. Shame on you reviewers."
1,Yes Man,I received the DVD case and instructions to downlowd the movie and after amny tries on different occasions was never able to download the movie. Great price for nothing.
4,Stick to what you do best Jim,This is what Jim should do with all his movies is be funny. He can always make me laugh in all his comedy movies. When his tries to be too much of a serious actor in other films they suck really bad. This movie is funny and teaches you a lesson on how most people should live their life instead of being serious most of the time.
4,Yes to Yes Man,"I am a Jim Carrey fan although many of his films are too over the top for me. However, Yes Man was great and I especially like the fact that the version I bought had the widescreen and the full screen versions on the same DVD and I didn't need all the extras that many DVD movies have. I prefer full screen movies and find them hard to find. This film reminded me of the Jim Carrey i enjoyed in Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar....a most enjoyable movie."
4,solid movie with a good message,"I've also read the book. As they usually say in such matters, the book was much more nuanced, the philosophy deeper. Plus, the adventures were almost all different.Still, this is an uplifting movie with a message that's worth your time."
4,"A very positive, funny and enjoyable comedy.","Jim Carrey at his best and Zoey Deschanel shines as an spontaneous, lively gal.The perfect movie to give you a boost of positive energy while making fun of the power (and consequences) of the word YES!!!.The ""Harry Potter party"" sequence will be a classic.I totally recommend this movie.The DVD has some good additional language options (subtitles or movie in Spanish and French)"
2,"An Ok, But Not Great, $1 Rental.","It has a poor storyline that meanders, and often stalls. The Characters are under developed. And then, sarcastic sexual situations or jokes are called-in to save the situation. But they do not help, they just make the movie inappropriate for family viewing. Anyway, the cast does manage some funny moments here and there."
2,Carrey lite,"The concept of this movie is great--a guy who always says no to everything is convinced to change his life he must say yes to everything. This could have been mined for great comedic laughs especially given Jim Carrey is the lead actor here. Sadly, the script is terrible. The worse is the last 20 minutes where it devolves into some sort of pining woe-is-me before, of course, the happy ending.The cast is pretty decent and deserved better. Having said that the lead actress Zooey (yep, that's her name) Deschanel is not very appealing. She plays a character with her own quirks but it's so low key you'd think she's comatose at times. She also is very unbelievable when she tries for angry in a scene.No extras at all on this version of the DVD and, frankly, if you do make it through this movie without fast-forwarding any of it, Warner Bros. should give you a medal or something."
3,Great Movie! Pleasantly surprised!,"This is not a typical Jim Carrey movie. He's about at a level 4 or 5 instead of 7 or 8, which makes the comedy settle and not so over the top."
3,makes one nostalgic for old Jim Carrey movies,"One can't help but reminisce about the 1990s, a time when Jim Carrey was hilariously funny and Judd Apatow's raunchy, but heartfelt raunchy comedies didn't exist. Those days are gone. Instead, movies like Yes Man are made - Jim Carrey is forced to suppress his humor because it is even less politically correct these days than it was in the '90s, everyone pretends that they are filming a Judd Apatow comedy even when they are not, and there must be absolutely be some sort of revelation made at the end of the movie about current trends (i.e., Jim Carrey's character wants to ""be with the girl"" but not move in with/marry her)."
2,"I wouldn't say yes, just maybe",Jim Carrey really has been in a lot of stinkers lately. This one is no different. It is extremely predictable and the characters are 1 dimensional. If you really want to see the best of Carrey go back to his earlier stuff. Lately he's been churning out the same character over and over again.
3,Standard Jim Carey Fare,"I watched this movie recently with my 13-year-old son and wife (both BIG fans of BRUCE ALMIGHTY).I thought it was humorous. Fairly clean (one scene with a randy senior citizen needed fast-forwarding).Not outstanding, but funny."
2,"Yes man, a big no!","Im not sure when it became apparent that Hollywood began confusing funny with cutesy but it seems to be what they do best these days and Yes Man is no different.What started out promisingly enough, in the tradition of Liar Liar, soon petered out to be something more annoying than actually funny. Sometimes a good romantic comedy is a welcome deviation from the gloom and doom laden flicks that are the norm these days.How about actually making one funny though instead of cute and sappy. Cute just isnt funny, just ask M. Mcconaghey (sp.), he wouldnt know funny if it hit him like a truck.If you actually prefer real funny over just cute then stick with ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" or the raunchier ""Me, myself and Irene"".""Yes Man"" goes for a few chuckles at best, very few."
2,"Hard to stomach, but has its moments","This trite, insipid waste of time has a number of moments worth following: Those surrounding the cult that Carey finds himself involved in (not the Carey's typically overdone, poorly written, poorly controlled character itself) give a few chuckles, and the female lead shines with a well-written, though still outlandish, and played in something close enough to a nuanced manner to shine next to the washed out and repetitive Carey character. The main character is essentially a rehash of the family friendly Carey from Liar Liar et al, but has a handful of adequately morally questionable moments to make the viewer wonder why he couldn't bring something a bit darker and different to bear.This film might be worth watching as the second or third movie on a long flight, as it was for me, but I'm extremely glad I didn't spend money on this film."
1,"Mind Numbing Dumb, Unfunny","I checked out Amazon reviews just to see if anyone was going to give this sham of a movie 5 stars. As expected, some people did. Apparently there is a market for every piece of garbage that Hollywood produces.This is a movie that Jim Carrey will want to forget quickly. It's almost sad watching one of Hollywood's most talented comedians turn into a pale shadow of his former self, trying to force some laughs out of this miserable script. The plot is obviously an attempt to replicate Liar Liar along the same lines but whereas Liar Liar was clever and funny, Yes Man is dumb and unfunny. Watching Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel read those trite script lines is almost painful."
1,Parents of children under 16: beware,"This movie is typical Jim Carrey nonsense. Call me a prude but I don't think it's necessary to include oral sex in a PG-13 movie. I watched this movie with my 13-yr-old and 16-yr-old and was totally embarrassed during the scene with Carl's neighbor, Tilly. My son fast forwarded it to the next scene.Some parents may not care. Some may not have the time to check. But I think it's totally unnecessary to include that kind of sexual practice in a PG-13 movie. Either it shouldn't be allowed or a new rating should be developed. There are hundreds of impressionable middle school students who watch these kinds of movies and think it's ok to behave in that way. Seeing it on the big screen just promotes it.What happened to good clean romantic comedys?"
3,Yes-Man,"The DVD was in good shape but the case came in broken - no what was expected for a ""like new"" product."
4,Fun to say 'yes',"Jim and Zoey make a great team in this movie - while Jim is his usualy goofy slap-stick self through many parts Zoey creates a nice balance and brings some real-life to the story. It's a feel-good fun story that makes you want to go out and say 'yes!' to life (within reason, of course)."
2,Mediocre movie with an unexpected New Zealand gem,"New Zealander Rhys Darby (Norman) steals the show. His puppy dog-like earnest open-heartedness is simultaneously touching and hilarious.Carrey tries too hard — big surprise, that — but never elicits the same sympathy from this viewer."
3,O.K.,"Not as good as many Jim Carrey movies. The plot was cute and the characters well cast, but I don't think i will watch it again."
2,"Ehh... it was one of those weird ""mature"" Jim Carrey movies","I am one of those ""original generation"" of fans of Jim Carrey, back when he was on Saturday NIght Live and when he did movies like Liar, Liar (classical!). But his newer movies are kinda weird... mid-life crisis, kinda creepy (especially when he has a younger love interest). I still love his old movies. But this one (Yes Man) wasn't the worst... it was actually one of his better newer movies. But I still didn't care for it. It's a take it or leave it in my book, not a must-see movie but one if you got nothing else to do."
5,Funny Movie,This is a funny movie and I really enjoyed it..so much that I also bought it on Blu-ray very good movie
5,LOVE!,"Love Jim Carey, he is hillarious in this movie! I am pleasantly surprised and the price was def. a plus!"
5,Jim Carrey = The Man,If you love Jim Carrey you should buy this movie and if you already own it on DVD then buy it again anyways.
4,A good film with lots of laughs.,I've had people tell me they didnt like the movie but I thought it was a good flick. Jim is very funny as usual and at the very least I would recommend a rent if not a buy. If you a JC fan you should def buy it.
2,Didn't Stand a Chance,"I purchased the glider for my year and a half old Australian Heeler dog. In two weeks it was destroyed. I liked the weight of the glider and the way it soared, but need something INDESTRUCTIBLE for my dog."
5,My pitbull's favorite toy,"My dog loved this frisbee. I purchased this frisbee hoping to find a frisbee that would last for over a minute. My pitbull destroys most frisbees in 1 minute flat, or less. This frisbee is soft and durable. Therefore, my dog has no problem picking up or catching the frisbee. I figure it's worth the $12.00 because it has been 2 weeks and I still have the frisbee in perfect condition. A small price to pay for product that makes my dog go crazy. FYI, My dog personally likes this frisbee the best of all."
4,Terrific toy but image is misleading,"My wife and I have a border collie and a pitbull mix. The border collie is wild about this frisbee and will chase it for hours or just run around with it in his mouth. The pitbull mix likes it, too, but he takes toys away, settles down, and chews them, so we don't let him keep the frisbee because he will destroy any toy he gets to spend unsupervised time with. I find it flies well (though not as far as a traditional frisbee) and is easy for the dogs to pick up. The one we've had for over a year or two has finally started to come apart, but even with a tear in it and tooth holes completely through it, it still flies and works well. This is a really terrific toy. I did find myself wondering if you got three with this offer and am glad other reviewers had noted that, no, you only get one, so that is misleading and it should specify that you are buying ONE, not three."
2,Great frisbee for super fast dog,Great frisbee love the ematerial but I needed a much larger slower flying frisbee for my dog to actually catch it.
5,Awesome dog toy!!,I have 2 border collies that absolutely love this disc. It glides beautifully through the air and they are able to make some spectacular catches. The disc is soft so that their teeth/gums are not irritated by multiple catches during a session of frisbee training. This is an awesome product for the price. Please understand that you will receive only ONE (1) frisbee with your order....still a great deal for this awesome dog disc!!
1,Image Inaccurate,"I am disappointed that the image of this toy shows three items, in three colors. It is misleading in that the description states ""Easy Glider Multi"" which indicates that multiple colors would come in the package.The description does not state ""one"" of the colors will be shipped. I am very disappointed in the value of this purchase and the misleading description."
1,TERE NAAM FAILS TO DELIVER,ON THE WHOLE TERE NAAM FAILS TO DELIVER. WEEK STORYLINE NO SENSE OKAY MUSIC TERRIBLE ACTORSSALMAN KHAN IS OKAY.BOOMIKA IS DUMB.A GREAT ACTOR LIKE SACHIN KHEDEKAR PROVES TO BE THE BEST YET AGAIN. A FILM WHICH IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME A TOTALY CARBAGE CAN NEVER WATCH IT!.
2,Disappointing for Sex and the City standards,"Some of the songs were great because they were on the show. But half of these were not. Where's the finale song? How can you have a soundtrack without the most important song of all? Plus what about ""Breathe"" by Michelle Branch, when Carrie is on the flying trapeese. I love the show but once again, disappointed w/ the soundtrack as well as the 50 bucks for season 5 w/ only 8 episodes. Tisk Tisk Sex and the City. Just because the show is over doesn't mean your job is done."
4,Just what I was looking for,"I've looked at the other two soundtracks available, and this is the CD with songs I've heard while watching the show.My favorite song is ""Point of View,"" which was played while Carrie was being photographed for her book cover. Great song with a nice tempo."
3,Does not do the series any justice...,"The only thing to recommend this album is that the catchy theme is on it twice and there are some credible tracks by some good artists, unfortunatly there are some lack lustre poor tracks too which just help ""fill"" the album. More bizarrely there are some tracks that never even featured in the show and lots of great tracks that did feature in the show are absent.Basically this album is a kind of okay workaday car album but really only stands out because it was so obviously, hastily slammed togehter to capitalise on the demise of the show a year ago and I for one despise that kind of commercial cynacism!"
4,La douleur exquise!!!,"What is that beautiful piano song at the end of ""la douleur exquise"" that plays when Big comes back to Carrie's apartment??"
3,what's the song..,"... the one where the girls are all getting ready to meet and they show shots of them all getting ready (they are going to an engagement party) and they show Samantha grabbing a condom, Miranda getting keys next to her palm pilot, etc."
3,help!,"Does anyone know the song that is played in the penultimate episode when Alexander Petrovsky gives Carrie the necklace, (I think it is French)???? I love it!!"
2,"What? No ""Hot Chid in the City""","Okay I haven't yet purchased this soundtrack but I was amazed that many songs I thought would be included in this, weren't. For instance, the divine episode of ""Hot Child in THe City""...that was a classic! How about that one tune, that lead Carrie down the cat walk? And the Sade song in the episode where Sam slow dances with Richard. I am utterly amazed that some songs were overlooked. I would have bought four copies if those songs were included. I'm dissappointed. I'm sure there is a good excuse as it why many songs were cut from the final product."
4,Winging through the years,"I knew Golschmann when he retired from St. Louis and took over the old Denver Symphony. We knew his readings of these works in Denver and the the two old releases that make up this disc were big sellers here.The Franck is a little heavy-footed, somewhat like the Monteux-Chicago from 1960, but it is deeply felt. The Shostakovitch is one of the great readings, and while the SLSO was not up to its present standards in '53, it wasn't exactly a scrub-team either (that one was in Denver). Of course, in both there are sloppy moments, but who cares? Golschmann lays out his considerable art for all to enjoy since this is an easy CD to find and afford.I wouldn't rate this as the best Franck--for that you have to go to Paul Paray on Mercury--but the Shosty, with its blinding intensity and honest emotion, its wide range and spiritual delicacy is as good as you're going to get.A fine testment to a truly great artist."
5,Surprised,"Really enjoyed this puzzle. It looks exactly like the picture. It's also much larger than I expected a 550 piece puzzle to be at 18x24"". The only downside for me is that the box is rather small, which meant putting the cover picture rather close to my eyes so I could compare the small details of the individual pieces to the picture."
2,There's a reason why this book is out of print,"I was looking for a book that would give me advice on how to project my voice, control breathing and reduce stress on the throat. I was hoping this book would help. It didn't too much, not as much as I wanted it to anyway. It was good when he talked about the voice but rarely did. His incessant need to preach throughout got a little old as well. Don't bother tracking this book down."
5,Nevillew Mariner is a genius,Brilliant performances of a lovely selection of great musicThis is certainly some very very nicely recorded well executed music
2,Not as advertised,This book has pieces to it which is why I bought it. The copy I had lost the pieces over the years. They said it was like new. That should mean that all the pieces are there. Very disappointed.
1,Nuttall's,"Very disappointing. The lettering is very blurred and most difficult to read, in fact some of the entries are impossible to read. Wherever possible I use my old very damaged version."
1,Good for landscaping,This shoe is just beautiful but not very comfortable. That would not have mattered because it is so good looking except that the wood chips off the bottom. I wore them once and a huge chunk of wood chipped off the front (of the toe area) and another small piece off the back. Wood looks nice but doesn't necessarily hold up well.
5,Great Sandals!,"These sandals are beautiful and easy to walk in. If you want to feel sexy, put these on!"
4,the best of roger miller,used to hear all trhese songs on the radio ... back in the 60's n early 70's .... this is some good listening ...
3,Tanith must have been slumming.,This book reminded me a little too much of Ann Rice. Tanith Lee usually does MUCH better.
4,"Book is very gud.But, only when u follow it also, after reading it :)","Condition of the book is gud.i m fully satisfied with condition of the book.All pages are just like new book.On the content of the book i can't comment ,i m yet to read .but with a birds eye view,book seems to be a very gud guide and very helpful if study habits are developed as per the instructions given in book."
1,Really?,"I just don't understand how anyone can see this as funny. I was given this book as a gift and was shocked that my friend gave it to me. I have a much evolved sense of humor and I actually hate this book. I was shocked to see it received any good reviews...it is just odd and bizarre...and not in a good way. There are a lot of funny, redeeming books out there and this is not one of them. I even hate to give it to Goodwill!!!"
3,maybe I don't get it,"I don't know, its cute but maybe I just don't get it. I mean haha its funny, but I wouldn't run out and buy copies for my friends, which is how I received it. dunno. just not for me."
2,Beware of Bitter Chicks bearing baggage,Shallow birds and shallow words. This little chick profers petty nihilisim posing as ironic humor. Unfortunately it lacks any real wit or insight. A gift of this book would be the perfect underhanded compliment for your annoying sister in law.
2,Bitter with Baggage boring,"Sorry, but I bought this book with quite high expectations of being intrigued and entertained and I found it really boring."
2,More cute than clever,"These foul fowl are nice to look at but exhibit some rather mean behavior. Decently photographed, a sharper wit might have made this book better. More childish than child-like."
2,Not for Kids....or many others.,"I thought this book looked cute, until I actually read it. The writer arranges chicks and doll furniture and then turns them nasty. I suppose this is supposed to be clever but I just found it DUMB. A bad spoof of Cosmopolitan magazine meets Chicken Little."
2,"""Cutesy"" But Not that Funny",I only smiled at one of the entries - will definitely be returning this and getting something else.
4,"GREAT gift for the hip ""chick"" in your life!","My co-worker received this as a birthday gift, and we howled all day! I WILL purchase one for myself and perhaps other single gal pals of mine! I don't know how she finds all the materials for the settings she photos the chicks in, it's a very creative, cute concept. But the humor and wit she uses in the captions on each page is what really tops this ""work of art"" off. They really capture the essence of us urban gals (and some chickens, too)! hip, hip hooray! Thanks for the smile!"
3,Almost there.,"I love the idea of this book--several of its pages make me laugh more than a little out loud. (No one's eating carbs anymore). I love the crafty creativity of the dioramas. However, I do feel that some of the jokes are trying a little too hard and fall flat. I also feel that this might have been more successful as a series of prints--at least I would like some of them to put on my wall (blue chicks coming to America)--something I can't do to a very nice book."
1,A picture book- no depth or content,"I have never bothered to write one of these in my years purchasing from Amazon but in this case the reviews and description of book are so misleading, that I felt compelled to let other readers know this is not a book for those you that are looking for depth or any insight.It is simply a picture book- a mighty expensive one at that. It is hardly a social commentary, rather a depiction of pop culture--and a form of it in itself.I do not recommend this book for anyone. Unless you like to consume mindless ""pop culture"" regularly."
3,Well-drawn characters; entertaining novel set in academia,"The first half of this book shows a horribly plausible example of a middle aged marriage falling apart at the seams, due to chance happenings. The psychology of the husband, Brian Tate, is thoroughly and sympathetically examined - he looks like a success, but his own self-view is very different. This, and the great feeling of the palce and period (1969) are the strengths of this novel.Its weaknesses are that it gets less convincing towards the end, and the author's rather simplistic femanism gets the better of her, particularly when pontificating on male relationships.Overall, not one of her best, but still a good read."
2,"Depressing, pointless, formulaic, shallow","This book is awful. The characters are one-dimensional, have no self-knowledge whatsoever, and are unbelievably stereotypical. It's not badly written, but it's pointless, depressing, and it's hard to figure out what it all means. Just a bad idea. It's also very badly dated."
2,Only the names are the same,"A bible story like it was never told. All Israel looks like 1960's Italians. And when Goliath (Kronos) first appears they use 60's sci-fi music. I'm not sure but I think King Saul (Orson Welles) mumbles in Italian. The story has slightly changed and So David (Ivica Pajer) gets the girl and congratulations from Old King Saul. His rival (no not Goliath) Abner (Massimo Serato) gets the shaft.The only real sad part was the scene where poor innocent cutie shepherd girl gets electrocuted.I can not avoid saying ""Read the Book""Samson"
1,Chopped and mutilated,"Aside from the problems mentioned by the previous reviewer, this copy of the film is badly mutilated. It was filmed in a 2.35:1 aspect. What you get is 1.33:1. Some 40% of the film has been chopped off. I wouldn't have this trashed version if they payed me to take it."
4,Good But A Bit Harsh,I love how soft my skin feels after using this product but I think it has alcohol in it. This makes it pretty harsh and drying on my skin but moisturizing real well seems to do the job for me!
3,"Good, but- - -",I ordered this for my son and he says this is OK.But when I opened the package the cap of the bottle was broken.Otherwise the product itself is fine.
4,Great for cleaning skin,"I have suffered from acne since my teen years. Now in my early 30's, I noticed milia (small keratin-filled bumps) on my cheeks and under my eyes. I've tried numerous treatments in vain for the past year or so, but they would always come back. I actually searched ""milia"" on Amazon, and this product came up, so I thought I'd give it a try. That was several weeks ago, and my skin is now smoother and clearer than it's been in recent memory. I use the toner every morning after showering, and have no complaints, aside from a small complaint about the smell. But, I'd rather use a product that smells like what it is, than something perfumed with artificial chemicals.Update: Please see the comments section. I've reduced my rating to 4 stars because my milia came back. I'm now just using this product for when I need a deep clean, but sticking to other methods to clear my skin."
3,$3.49 at local store,"I mixed it with my organic baby cleansing lotion for his bottom. It works fine, I only wish I bought it for $3.49 at the local store instead of $10.40 on Amazon!!!"
1,Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Toner 16 oz.,"The speedy delivery and quick service was my immediate response to feedback but I bought this as a gift for my husband for his birthday so it was not opened for awhile. Trying to be kind he said, OH MY THIS SMELLS LIKE DIRTY SOCKS!!....I was floored because as a child I remembered the scent of my Father coming out of a Barber Shop and that was what we were looking to purchase. I also awhile back bought Bay Rum for the same reason and it was an excellent buy although expensive well worth the price of the item. For those who have given this an excellent rating it is obvious that this a mixed review item. Now that it has been opened to late to return!!"
1,stolen,well I never actually got a chance to use this toner. I did try a different toner from hazel that worked miracles on my skin. I would diffidently recommend hazel toners to friends and anyone who wants to have better looking skin.
4,Got acne? Try this.,"This witch hazel toner is 1/3 the price I usually pay for other facial toners. I When I saw this I was literally astounded. They're so cheap and affordable ($2.99 for a 16 fl oz bottle at my local Walgreen), not to mention it works fine. This soothes my acne prone irritated skin after I remove my make-up at night. It doesn't dry out my skin despite the fact it contains 14% of natural grain alcohol. Witch hazel is also great for acne. Besides, you should really apply less of chemical ingredients if your face is breaking out and start going natural. There's no added artifial fragrance either but I found the smell to be very fouling, but I can't really complain. This should last me a long time and I'll keep on buying this product unless there aren't going to be any change in ingredients and price."
1,Missing booklet,"The price was good and the delivery was nice and fast but the dealer failed to send the watch booklet and warranty. As this watch is a supposedly a new watch it should have an appropriate booklet for the particular model. This will be the last time I use this dealer because they are careless and unprofessional. I would still like the booklet if you can get it for me. Thanks, siyatasha"
4,up from the ashes,this solo of don dokkenis one of the best albums of that year when he did depart the band called dokken also his vocals in that year when this solo album came out were un stopable this cd is a must for don dokken fans still today if you were to ask me but im old school so put the cd in and test it for your self riley sharp tampa fl
4,Solid Effort,"I really like this album. It is not as heavy as some Dokken efforts, however, it has a great sound at high volumes. If you like Don Dokken's vocals, as I do, you will enjoy this one for sure. I was very impressed when I bought the tape when it first came out. It sounds even better on CD. Crank it up and enjoy !!"
4,Surprisingly good CD,"I wasn't expecting much with this release after the way Dokken has gone in the 90's. However, I really like this CD. Mirror Mirror and Give it Up are among my favorites. There are also a number of solid hits on this CD as well. If you like classic Dokken, don't miss this one."
4,sorry I took so long,"For years, I ignored this disc because I had read reviews on how it was full of ballads and how it didn't come close to dokken. Well, not long ago I sampled it at a used cd shop and I was very suprised. In my opinion, this is just as good as any dokken album. Most of the songs on this could have come from ""Under Lock and Key or ""Back for the Attack."""
5,"You Don't Have, Are You Crazy? Buy It Now!!!!",This CD Did Not Get Near The Air Play It Should Have.This Is A Great CD.I Got It When It First Came Out I Have Always Been A Dokken Fan The Guitar Work On this CD Is Awsome Norum And White Make You Not Miss Lynch Not Taking Any Thing Away From George But They Are Great.All I Can Say Is Buy Now!!!!
2,Ashes to ashes..,"This is a very meticulous album, dense riffs, faster than the speed of light drum fills, and dazzling (faceless) fretwork (I can't keep my John Norums from my TNTs, from my King Diamonds, the solos are exceptional, but also pretty boring) with some nice acoustic seances thrown in for good measure. You have to give Don credit for making such a European album his first time out as opposed to a Bon Jovi slice of Americana which was to be expected. What this doesn't have are choruses that stick, Dokken's greatest strength. This thing just goes by as a more than competent excercise in musics and not much more."
5,very inspired - definitely Dokken's best,"it's ironical that I found out about UFTA 14 years after its release-I guess it tells it all about the bad direction the music scene took in the 90sit is also funny in a way that this is by far Dokken's best collection of songs in my view (yes even better than the truly excellent and recommended Erase the Slate), but it was published in times when people and MTV didn't care anymore about rock musicall the songs are strong and a very positive inspiration flows through the CD-the solos utterly and totally shred, amazing stuffplease trust me and get the CD you'll love it from the first listening"
2,Blah.........,"While not being a terrible, this is no Dokken album. Even though by listening to it, you might think it sounds like them. Upon further inspection, you will notice the absence of George Lynch. There are only a couple tunes I like. ""Give It Up"" & ""Mirror Mirror"". The latter being the only single from the album. If you are looking for a great Dokken CD after ""Back For Attack"", go straight for ""Erase The Slate"". Don't bother with this."
4,good listening and great guitar sounds,"I enojed each song, the guitar is mellow and almost talks. Its great for backgound or just listening while reading. Also listen to Chamin Correa's ""Curdas, Amor y Guitarra"" it is also terrific."
4,Ground breaking!,"Amy's first Album simply titled ""Amy Grant"" is relaxed yet at the same time ground breaking- she really puts her heart in to it. She does an awesome job communicating her faith and exploring the depths of love- Awesome first Album Amy!"
3,"Great product, but BEWARE AmericaRX","This is a great product increasingly hard to find. But BEWARE ordering it from AmericaRx! They charge $2.99 per can + $4.40 s/h PER CAN. That's right, the price is $7.39 per can, even if you order more than one (actually, they gave me a ""shipping promotion"" knocking off about a third of the s/h price, but that still comes out to around $6/can)! See other buyer complaints about AmericaRx pulling these shipping-charges stunts. They package them together, but charge separately.There are other sellers of the same product who don't sneak your money this way. Find another seller besides AmericaRx."
4,Do yourself a favor and get it!,"I haven't bought a rap CD since Company flow was still around.Im a huge MF Doom,MadvillianI stumbled upon Black Milk and Guilty Simpson and I got nothing but love for them.The beats are raw and so are his lyrics,to me its sorta like the new styles with some old school feel to it.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys rap/music. Stones Throw is a pretty sweet record label."
2,Clasp is as bad as others said,"While the watch is attractive and comfortable. The clasp is as bad as other reviewers indicated. We've been tempted to lose the ability to adjust the band and glue the clasp in place. The clasp opens and falls off frequently, luckily I haven't lost it yet."
4,Smart and practical,"I love this watch. It looks great, is easy to adjust and keeps great time. Pity the date is not a wee bit bigger as it is rather small and difficult to see. Great price as well - I have a gold one as well so that I can alternate with whatever jewellery I am wearing!"
2,Looked great until crystal cracked,I gave this to my wife for her birthday and even with very careful use the crystal cracked after only a few months. Big disappointment and of course it isn't covered under warrantee.
5,Skagen watch - women's two tone mesh,"I absolutely love this watch. It is so easy to wear- not bulky, plain yet can be worn from work to out for dinner. Very easy to wear with all types of clothing. Cannot beat the price as well. Just love it"
3,skagen watch,very comfortablelove the lookthe catch to close it is a little sharp on the cornersnot good for holding children...
3,works well- so far,"My watch is a few weeks old now and ticking away nicely.When I first saw it and tried it on I was a little disappointed and wished I could just change it to a different one.I have not seen this in a store before so just the reviews and the photo made me choose it over a few of my other picks.The much talked about band's closure works fine but to my liking it's too troublesome to put it on in a hurry.I guess has to be like that for safety.My other dislike is that it's look is not so feminine,more like a unisex style.The two tone effect is too overwhelmingly on the silver side, and unfortunately this one do not suit my skin tone at all.I just wished I had tried it on somewhere before,now I can only hope it works well and in time I'll get use to it."
5,great watch,I've had this watch for eight years and it still keeps perfect time. Great looking on the wrist. Love the security and adjust-ability of the clasp. For the price you simply can't go wrong. Comes with nice packaging so it'd make a great gift.
5,Skagen Womans watch,"The Skagen 355SGSC watch was opened in delight by my wife. The design was superb - elegant and finely finished, light, and sized properly for a woman's wrist. It is a wonderful gift and an excellent value, especially when compared to whatever else is out there in womens watches (and we did look at plenty)."
4,Good watch for the price paid,"Bought this watch for my wife, she likes it.""+""+ Stylish & expensive-looking+ stainless steel case and bracelet+ has a date""-""- Not too good for a small hand. Though it is possible to adjust the bracelet to different sizes, on a small hand there will be a long part of the band left (under the ""top layer""). It is difficult to make this part invisible, as it tends to come from one of the sides.- The clasp is tight. Hope it will be easier to open and close after some usage.- The combination of the brushed metal dial and the golden hands makes it difficult to read, especially in dim light.- The golden ""piece"" is actually just a thin film layer on the inner side of the glass."
3,good watch - good price,My Skagen watch arrived quickly. The price was very reasonable. I did not receive instructions (for the watchband) or any registration card. That was what struck me as the difference between ordering it from Amazon and buying it in a store. Otherwise all is fine and I would order again. I like my watch a lot!
4,Beautiful looking watch,"The clasp took a little while to get used to, but otherwise a nice looking slim watch."
3,"Beautiful, but hard to read","This watch works and looks as advertised, but turns out to be too hard for me to read. From the picture, I thought the raised gold hour markers and the long gold hands would have enough contrast with the white background, but in fact the combination of glare on the crystal, and the moving second hand, mean I have to tilt the watch just so, and then wait a few seconds to be sure I'm reading it right. I'm wearing it in spite of this, though, because it is very comfortable (once I figured out how to adjust the band) and a beautiful accessory."
3,Skagen watch,"The clasp is hard to open; a more pronounced ""lip"" would enable better use of thumbnail.Watch looks OK and keeps good time"
4,small n classy,"i was surprised with the quality of this watch, its understated yet attractive. all in all its a pretty good watch for everyday use. nothing fancy nothing blingy, just a simple elegant accessory."
3,Okay purchase,"My latest purchase of a Skagen watch came on time, as advertised, but I was unable to figure out the exact size of the dial and wristband from the picture. As it turns out it was a little larger than I had hoped for."
4,"5 star beauty, 3 star function","Skagen watches are cleanly elegant, and this one especially so. But the minute and second hand are so alike that telling time quickly is difficult. Also I had trouble setting the date because the stem has no grooves and my fingers slipped. Buy this watch if beauty is more important than practicality."
2,Great Watch - doesn't work,"Very good looking watch, but doesn't work - the pin had a little piece of plastic on it, so that the battery is not discharged, but when I took out the plastic and started the watch, it works like it has a flat battery. useless. Now I will have to go to a watch place, find a parking space, pay another $10 (on a watch that cost over $50) to get a new battery put in the thing. Can't even send it back, because guess what, it looked so good, I threw away the packaging, thinking this was going to be a great watch. So not really impressed to say the least."
5,beautiful watch,I really like this watch. It keeps good time and it looks great doing it.I have large wrists so I was woried that it would not fit but the band is veryajustable.
5,Love it,I have this watch and just love it!!!! I have owned it for 2 years now and have never had a problem with it.The only issue and I am sure it was my fault is that the band mesh broke and does snag things. But I am not careful with my watches I wear them every day the only time my watches come off is to take a shower.I even jumped in the pool once with it on. Thinking it was a goner and it did not hurt it a bit! It just kept on running. Trust me if anything happens to this watch I will be purchasing the exact same one again. On Amazon. Much better price here than at the dept. store where I purchased it.
3,"Very attractive watch, mesh bracelet is problematic","Love the LOOK of this watch - have had to return the last two as the mesh bracelet kinks, producing sharp metal barbs that RIP my delicate clothing as my arm brushes against my side when I walk. The snags and tiny tears the band makes in the fabrics are NOT nice!Other than that, the watch is lovely."
2,Poorly designed strap,"The closing ""snap"" on the watch strap is so poorly designed as to be unworkable.You are not sure if it has closed securely or if the snap will open and you may losethe watch. The watch itself is fine."
2,strange clasp and function of strap,"The clasp doesn't close tightly, and I'm concerned that the watch will not stay on my wrist through daily activity. Because my wrist is small, I have to move the clasp to tighten it, then the strap under my wrist is very long. I don't care for the functionality of the strap design, even though it's pretty. Returning it."
3,"nice watch, difficult clasp & bad battery","This is my second Skagen watch and I loved my first one. I still love the band and face but the clasp is difficult to open and close. With my busy schedule, I decided to just live with it. Next time, I'll take the time to try on the watch before buying it. Also - the battery died after 2 weeks."
2,Bad strap design,"Loved the watch, although it was larger than what i previously owned. The strap continued to spring open on its own and i couldn't find a local jeweler who could fix it. I sent it back after 2 frustrating weeks."
2,disappointed in watch,I was a little disappointed with this watch. I already owned one of these watches and loved it---but this one is hard to read. The second hand is too long and makes it hard to tell the correct time
2,Very small face,"I have 4 Skagen slimline watches. They are my favorite and thought this would be the same. The face is much smaller and it is not a slim as I had expected. I found what I was looking for at the mall, but paid 3 times as much."
2,Needs proper editing,"The Ediacaran fossils are an interesting chapter in the history of life. They are also an interesting chapter in ""The Garden Of Ediacara."" Unfortunately, this book appears to have more material in it about Mark McMenamin than it does about the subject matter. Is it truly necessary to show a photograph of a hotel in Namibia or the author's official Mexican fieldwork badge in order to discuss the first complex life forms? I don't think so. The reader truly has to pick and choose what paragraphs to read in order to learn about Ediacaran fossils as opposed to the author's travelogues. Much of the material is simply extraneous. Proper editing would have made this book much more interesting and pleasurable."
1,"Disappointing, good ideas and lousy execution.","I have read the book nearly twice and each time close it with a deep sense of disappointment. The problem I have with the story is the personal observation and biographical material. I wanted to read about Ediacaran animals NOT the namibian airport, recalcitrant gatekeepers and inane diary entries about who the author had dinner with. Some of the book could have been taken up with more photos and perhaps professional sketches and not the crayon drawings from Mrs Thompson's second grade class.The ideas the author presents on the fauna are what made me get through the book at all. Those were great but occupy very little of the book."
2,Too much extraneous material.,"Disappointing reading. There is some interesting information here, but it is mostly at the end. Before you find it though, you have to go thru a lot of personal anecdotes in tedious detail and other interjections of questionable relevance. A pity, because some of the ideas and explanation seemed good, but in need of fuller treatment."
1,The author shows little understanding of evolution,The author makes the hypothesis that Edicaran fauna are distinct from other multicellular animals and that they underwent a different type of embryological development. The book presents no real scientific test of these ideas. Instead appeals to over extended analogies and conjecture.
4,The Garden of Ediacara,"The Garden of Ediacara is the only book I know of which is devoted to these early mutlicellular organisms. The book is fairly well written and deals with a number of questions about these early organsisms. Among these questions are; the feeding habits of the organisms, their early development, their relationship (or lack of it) to modern animals, their development and mode of reproduction, their extinction, and the possibility that they evolved a simple central nervous system. Several of the chapters in this book could be better written and also contribute little towards the understanding of these organisms. This seriously detracts from the book. The end of the book deals with the question of whether or not evolution is random and makes for interesting reading. It contradicts S. J. Gould's contention that evolutionary sucess is heavily dependent on random factors. As this is the only book about the Ediacara and it's mostly well written, I would recommend it."
5,good fun pop,"I've had this on tape for years. As most of the Crowded House/Split Enz repertoire -- this is a fun, fun, fun album. ""Hard Act to Follow,"" ""Clumsy"" and ""Iris"" are such great tunes. I'm happy to find a CD of this OOP album. Yay!"
1,Original Ipod Headphones Earphones Nano / Photo / Mini,"I thought I was buying original ipod headphones by apple, but I didn't examine the details thoroughly enough. Even if they're not by Apple, they're surprisingly bad for its price. I think the $2.50 ones would be of similar quality to these that are $12.95.Once you plug the headphones into your ipod you have to tamper with the connection (the end that's plugged into the ipod) to get optimal sound. And the optimal sound isn't when it's plugged in all the way like it should be. You have to put it about 2mm from all the way to get the optimal sound. But the thing is, if you move at all, the sound gets distorted because the connection is bad, resulting in either a scratchy sound, sound from only one side, or fluctuating volume. It's definitely not something I'll use unless I'm sitting down. Even then, the quality is nothing like the real apple headphones."
2,Warm bass with no mid tone precence,"If you like your music to be warm, with no mid range sound stage, cushioned and over emphasised bass then these are for you. Also these HD 465s have a fabric tensioned over the cup which squashes your ear (rather than surround it) and lets ambient sound enter. I returned my HD 465 after receiving them as a gift and went to the HD 555.My opinion is that the HD 485 has similar sound with a better cup ( no fabric tensioned), but the best option is the HD 555 for Au$85 extra.The Sennheiser HD 555 has a large plug jack designed for the lounge amplifier rather than an iPod, so to use it on an ipod you have to plug the large jack into the adapter and end up with a double plug the same height as your iPod again.Another good thing about the HD555 is they are very comfortable over hours of listening, have a sleek look which is in contrast to the 80's design of the HD465/485s."
1,"disappointing, even for elementary school child","Book is poorly edited for spelling, grammer, theme, and drawing corrections (done with SCRIBBLES!). Logic and flow in the pranks are inconsistant and not age appropriate. A small amount of adult guidance, with attention to the above aspects would have helped significantly. Also VERY overpriced for quality of presentation, especially for a black and white paperback."
1,Not Satisfied with Dsc-T7 nor Satisfied with butterfly photo,"I purchased this camera on March 27, 2005. The pictures are dark, blurry, bad quality,shaky with bad color. The only thing which is good on this camera is the look. A $20 throw-away camera has better picture quality! Absolutely no follow-up customer service from Butterfly Photo once they receive your money."
2,"Good design, don't like picture quality.","I love the size of this camera, but I use this camera for business, so when I shoot a photo I have to rely on it for a good shot. I just can't live with the picture quality. I was disappointed with the indoor shots, funny dark brownish color,it never seems to get the color right indoors. I liked being able to shoot short videos, and being able to carry it easily,but like I said I get unreliable picture quality.You would have to carry the manual around to remember what the symbols mean to set it for a different exposure. I hate to send it back, but I give up."
3,Nice camera but having trouble in low light,"I've been using the T7 for 6 months now. It's a nice camera, great size and nice features however I've been having focus issues when taking pictures in low light, or using the flash. My previous camera, Canon IXUS400, seemed to be better in low light and when using the flash. With the T7, I've tried manual settings however I've not been able to improve the pictures. If anyone has some suggestions, I'd appreciate it. I'm giving the T7 3 stars. If I could improve the above, I'd easily give it 4.5 stars."
2,It's OK if you're not much into image quality,"The thing is that it is not a very stable camera, hence it does not give you very stable shots, so many of your pics will be blured. Even those taken with a tripod. I am a pro photographer, and I would not recommend this camera. Yes, it's very thin, but is not worth the pics it takes...Seek for other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images."
2,IF you only want a daylight camera its allright,"I bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design....but the pictures it takes suck, specially in the night time or with flash, you can barely see what you are photographing.THe video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video, but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio-in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera...so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace...Its small and portable, and i could fit it in any pocket, so thats good, but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min...that's what it says, but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min, so it only does last like 30 min."
5,Sony DSC - T7,"Camera was all I was hoping it would be. Compact, great screen, and easy to use. Love being able to put it in my shirt pocket!"
1,If you like blurry pictures - this one is for you !!!,"I've had this camera for a year now and every day I regret spending so much on a piece of equipment that is so poor. My old Sony Cybershot is 10 times the size, 5 years older but takes better pictures.Don't get me wrong - I normally love Sony products but DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE ABOUT THIS CAMERA. It is truly awful."
3,"Great camera, wait for a latter version...","Yeah, like I said... New model... great flash about 9ft efective. Same Price... DSC T9 ... and has Image Stabiliser...OK, so your thinking of buying this camera... well, its understandable, its a beautifull camera, has tons of features and it will make you the envy of every other digital camera holder... BUT what's to happen when you print your photos? They come out sub par. I have a SD10 from Canon, wich is an older model and takes better pictures then this one.Image Quality will get about a 6/10Looks 10/10Battery life 4/10Flash (wich affects picture quality) 3/10I recomend holding out till they make a newer model. Why? Battery life and flash are things camera makers usually correct with time... why spend around $450 bucks for a camera thats going to have a better and improved model in a few months."
2,"Great Looking, Not So Great Functionally","First of all, I was so excited to get this camera, mainly because of the size and look. But the second I started taking pictures, I became very disappointed because despite being a 5.1 megapixel camera, none of the pictures I came out were sharp at all. And you have to be absolutely still when taking pictures otherwise everything comes out blurry. Very disappointed. My other five year old digital camera takes MUCH better pictures."
3,Not bad...,"The sony camera way ok, I had no problems with it, it works ok... I also like the battery charger that came with the camera."
1,"If you have a camera phone, don't bother.....","This camera is a pile of garbage. I bought it as the ""perfect"" pocket camera to sneak into a concert. Maybe 2 of my 40 shots were decent, but still grainy and slightly blurry. Shots w/o flash looked comparable to my phone's -unnatural color, grainy, blurry. The flash (even with the anti-red-eye feature) gave all of my friends red-eyes. Video is okay, but randomly focuses in and out like it can't make up its mind??? Auto-focus is the worst ever. The most frustrating part is how misleading the LCD is (only nice feature) because the pics looked great on it -until you upload them on to your computer. Lens cover and moving parts felt cheezy as well. I took it back the next day."
5,Good Movie,Everyone should see this movie several times to really get the message covered. Powerful message by James Garner in this one.
5,excellent acting superb screenplay,"james garner and julie andrews sparkle in this romantic comedy with a message..... james coburn (RIP) is also excellent in a supporting roleif you love British accents and enjoy excellent writingThe Americanization of Emily fits the bill!!!! Unfortunately it was filmed in black and white, although it is not a movie that antedated Technicolorthe character development is wonderfully stereotypical and quite hilariousi loved this movie when i first saw it and seeing the DVD, which until recently had been difficult to acquire was a fond visit with an old friend"
5,The funny side of the War!,"This is an anti war picture that reminded me in many ways to that glorious Billy Wilder 's film of 1953 Stalag 17, which chooses the comedy to unmask certain hidden vices. Kubrick ' Dr. Strangelove somehow marked the pathway this satiric genre that culminated with Norman Jewison 's The Russians are coming.Paddy Chayevsky 's skillful screenplay is adapted from William Braford Huie 's book about a Navy officer whose man job during WW2 is to supply his superiors with creature comforts including girls. On the other side of the bridge there will be a widow portrayed by Julie Andrews who despises Garner 's non heroic attitude, but can not help falling in love with him.The final is funny but there is a lot of cynicism that runs as corrosive acid throughout the film. Admirable work of Arthur Hiller and in many senses this could be his masterpiece."
2,Did I miss something?,"I saw this movie about 20 years ago when it was on Cinemax. I fell asleep while watching it then. I bought the DVD as part of the Controversial Classics set, and was looking forward to seeing the parts I missed.This time, I fell asleep twice watching it; it took a total of three nights to see it all. I found it just as talky and heavy-handed as I did when I saw it back in college. Further, I didn't pick up on any chemistry between the leads, and found James Coburn's character loud and annoying. Finally, the great MGM hairstylist Sidney Guillaroff was way off the mark on this one. Almost all of the women had mid-60's hairdo's that were distracting, particularly Miss Andrews, whose distracting poofie 'do often changed from shot to shot within the same scene.I get it; war is bad. Nevertheless, this film did little for me. It did, however, look very nice; the DVD transfer was well done."
3,"Decent quality, nothing too amazing","Decent mirror. I don't use the stand since the angle doesn't work for my bathroom. For the 10x side to work, you have to bring it real close to your face. I just end up using it as a basic hand mirror with the 1x side. And yeah, those lights are tiny, so don't think of them as a factor when deciding whether to buy this or not."
5,hand mirror 1 x to 10x,"item is as stated ,first class,arived in great shape,well werth the moneyA 1 DEAL XXXXX"
4,mirror,"Lightweight, easy to work with, but plastic stand not adjustable and angle is difficult to use.Appears that Zadro is discontinuing this mirror and they should not as it is the only mirror with this design."
2,Nice mirror- laughable lighting!!,"This mirror is large, light, and distortion free - and the stand idea works. But as for the lighting...it was downright laughable! It is two tiny dim flashlight spots. It doesn't light the mirror surface AT ALL. This would possibly get 3 stars from anyone just wanting it for a magnifying mirror, if it didn't claim that it was a lighted mirror. It is NOT a lighted mirror- it is a mirror with a lighted handle!"
4,great detail on mirror,"nice detail and lighting, works great for travel since its just 2 AA batteries, I would get another one if this was lost or broken"
1,Mirrors are crap!,"I ordered one of these mirrors for my mom and one for me. After much prodding, she admitted that she couldn't see with the mirror, the lights didn't shine on the viewing area. The next time I visited, I checked the mirror and sure enough, the lights were dim. I ordered another one for her and tried to return the first. The price had gone up $5 and there is a return fee. I just ordered another one, it didn't work either. Out of three mirrors, one worked sporadically. I boxed up the other two and sent them back with a letter. I was never reimbursed, didn't get the mirrors back and didn't hear from the company.Crappy mirrors, crappy service."
4,Tweezing by light of firefly,"Very good magnification, but reflections blur when mirror is angled. The stand is convenient for free hand zit popping. The light is as bright as a firefly however. I suppose if you needed to illuminate AND magnify something deep in a dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and only had this mirror with batteries installed, you may actually have praise for the light feature. Of course, if you happened to be lost in that deep dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and wanted the light of the mirror to actually help you illuminate anything other than your nose, you would be as disappointed with the light as at almost any other time. Save your batteries. Regardless and overall, it is a good mirror."
3,replacement of older one,"If you owned one of these in the past, be advised that the newer one, altho it appears identical, has light bulbs that are not as bright as the older ones."
2,These great photos deserve better,"The other reviewers are right about the humor and charm of these photos.However, in LIFE magazine they were full page, and beautifully printed which enhanced their impact. In this book, they are often partial page (many one third page), some cropped - and worst of all, very badly reproduced: blurry and with poor black and white contrast. Shame on Simon and Schuster for poor quality work in this age of high quality printing. I recommend the fine and reasonably priced ""Life Platinum Edition"" instead, until a better version of this comes out."
4,Best price,"I've been using Avery index tabs for years and they are a quality, but expensive, product. These 24 sets are the best price I know. The only negative is they don't get in sets like they do in the small packs. So the 1's are together, all the 2's etc. So it's a bit of a pain to put the sets together, but not a deal breaker."
3,My preference is his Bach CD.,"Manuel is my favourite guitarist...he has everything a musician could want: technical ability, fantastic sound and great interpretive abilities.Why do I rate this only 3 stars then? It has to do with the music more than anything else, I prefer Bach than Mozart on the guitar, but don't get me wrong, this is still a great CD to listen to."
3,ok time,"the daughter in the family disappears. the investigation does not seem to lead anywhere. the parents hav eto foind out for themselves, following the clues. they can not tell the police everything. and the kidnappers, what do they want? some weird components here, as always with D. still, it's a good read, but don't expect more."
3,accesories,Hello I'm looking for accesories of Motorola traxar gps and the instruction manual of this gps feel free to contac me jimenezg@isla.net
3,Could of been more,"Lansdale is a great writer. He's so good that he can write in his sleep -- which may be the problem with A Fine Dark Line. Lansdale's ability in dealing with issues of race, sexuality, good and evil, is remarkable. You never feel like you're being preached to, which is probably a testimony to Lansdale's good common sense. However, in A Fine Dark Line, the ghosts invoked come from other novels. Anyone who has read To Kill a Mockingbird or Tom Sawyer, knows he or she has read earlier and greater efforts. A violent fight at night in a storm; a town mystery or two; a boy entering into early manhood; strange lights down by the railroad tracks; a headless girl. American Folklore 101. Yep. Lansdale's pushing the buttons. Still, this book is worth a read, since you quickly come attached to the Mitchel family and their friends. But if you've read Lansdale's The Drive-in, you'll find yourself longing for the early wild man, as opposed to this tame, mainstream version of a pulp master."
2,Sennheiser RS 130,"I bought these headphones based on a CNET review and some of the reviews I read here at Amazon. For the most part these headphones received very good reviews but for my tastes there was too much hiss during quiet moments in movies or between programs.I also experienced discomfort wearing these headphones. The charging mechanism places two metal bands on the inside of the headband directly on top of your head. I could feel these metal bands pressing on my head whenever I wore the headphones.I'm returning these and trying the Sony IR MDR 4000. From what I've read, IR headphones do not produce hiss."
4,Happy with EarPhones,"If the volume of the head phones is up too high and volume of the source is too low, there is some hiss, but it is easily corrected. We are happy the head phones."
2,Less Than Expected,"Main problem is the wireless reception , even if you are very near you still hear some annoying noiseNothing like Wired headphones ...."
3,poor broadcast range,"I was disappointed in the RS-130, which cost considerably more than my Radio Shack set. The Sennheiser might be slightly more comfortable but the range is definitely less around the house."
5,Great Wireless Headphones,"Great sound quality, manageable hiss. Easily works at 100 ft, past that occasionally breaks up (depending on what's between you and the transmitter). Charging is easy.Buttons are slightly inconvenient. Ears are comfortable, but a couple hours of use leaves the top of my head a little uncomfortable."
4,Works as expected,"Of course, wireless headphones will not have the same fidelty as wired headphones, but the Sennheiser's perform as advertised. The sound is clear and the range is good, however at times some hissing is noticed. Increasing the volume of your device and reducing the volume of the headset seems to reduce most of the hissing sound. I would definitely buy these again and look forward to using them for TV and movies. Also consider purchasing an additional headset if you want to share the fun as it is a less-expensive option and both sets work with only one transmitter."
4,Nice sound,"I bought these so my wife could watch TV in bed while I read in peace, but the headphones offer a lot of added value. The sound quality is outstanding, and the surround-sound feature adds depth (though you can't have true surround sound with just two speakers). The included audio jacks should enable me to listen to my iPod as I walk around the house or yard without having a cord or even having the iPod with me, a big bonus. No more dropping the iPod out of my pocket or catching the wire on something. Haven't tried it yet, but the jack fits. Without the iPod in hand, you can't control the music, and the phones fight with your pillow when watching TV in bed, but these are small prices to pay for the beauty of wireless cans with the bright Sennheiser sound. Two thumbs up."
5,Exceptional fidelity,"The Sennheiser headphones have made my life so much more enjoyable. I do not have to ask my husband, whose hearing is better than mine, to turn up the volume. I can walk areound the kitchen preparing a meal or cleaning up after one and not miss a beat. I can turn the volume down for commericials. Wonderful addition to my life!"
3,Good sound and distance,I can get pretty far from the base and get good sound. They are really bulky though.
4,"Can't use two 130 systems together... see the ""Add-on Headphones"" product!","I have no complaints about the 130 product itself, however the Sennheiser website and the Amazon product description omit a critical fact for anyone who wants to, for example, use two 130 headphones in the same physical zone with their TV or other products. In our experience, the two transmitter units interfere with each other, resulting in a whining sound in both headphones. Apparently, you should buy one basic 130 product, then buy the 130 Add-on Headphones. Why don't the Amazon and Sennheiser product descriptions point out that two 130's cannot be used together, and you need to buy the Add-on Headphones?"
3,Only go wireless if you have to,"I've owned quite a few headphones in my life now, and this is one of my least favourite pairs. It's relatively comfortable despite its weight and bulk, but the audio quality is so far off from wired headphones that I was a bit shocked.Hiss and static interrupts every few seconds and the audio quality doesn't even approach a pair of good wired headphones at half the price.I'd be sitting 7 feet away with direct line of sight from the receiver and any shift in position could cause static.I'd rather deal with a cord than use these really."
1,They are not working,"I just got them yesterday. I usually do not need to compliant since every time I buy something it works. This time I waited 16 hours to charge the batteries and afterwards they never worked. The batteries do not show as being charged and I also got a new set of already charged bateries but still it never worked. I spent 3 hours and I finally realized that this product is not worth the money I spent since it is not going to help me ever to be relaxed. Usually you just plug the headphones and you are ready, but this time the manual of this product is not clear in any of the languages I can read...English and Spanish. Even worst..They are not cheap and now I will have to fix this situation that it does not look really bright."
1,These belong in the GARBAGE CAN!!!!!!!,"A waste of money.I had them for little over a year.Now, Ciao!in the GARBAGE!!!!!! Piece of junk. Save your money."
5,I love this headphone,The sound is great. They're easy to keep powered up. I can go to another part of the house and still hear what's going on with the TV very clearly. I am so satisfied.
4,Great set of wireless headphones,"Very good set of wireless headphones...no problems to speak of...you do have to ""tune"" them in every so often but once they catch on a good frequency they are crystal clear...I have not set them up on a system that delivers 5.1 surround sound yet to test how they attempt to recreate front/rear/center etc. but so far no complaints and I would recommend them to anyone in the market."
5,Great once you set it up,The Sennheiser RS 130 Headphones works great however there might be issues setting it up. They do take 16 hours to charge out of the box but once you get past that it's totally worth it. No wires... they do look big like dj headphones but the sound is great!
2,Can't get rid of the radio interference,"Plain and simple, sound is awesome except the intermittent interference that I can't get rid of no matter what channel I pick, where I place the base. I have moved it away from any electrical source (monitors, phones, power cords, etc). Very annoying and I don't use them anymore because of this. Very disappointing."
1,Disappointingly faulty product,Worked for one test period then ceased to power on ever again.Better results after replacing with $20 no-name product.
1,"Hiss, pop and crackle","I bought these Headphones and Iam totally disappointed. I wanted these headphones as I workout in the wee hours of the morning and would like to watch TV at the same time without disturbing the kids. At low source volumes (TV sound volume) and me 20 feet away from it there is constant hissing and swishing sounds especially as my head moves while working out. Raising the TV volume reduces this, but then defeats the purpose of headphone completely (do not want to disturb the household!) Also i constantly lose reception every 10-15 min and get cut off and though sometimes it scans and reaquires. I often have to manually turn the headphones off and on.I would certainly stay away from Sennheiser headphones. They are not worth the top dollar I paid for it."
4,Fantastic Heaphones,"I received these headphones as gift and let me tell you, they have been great. I can now actually listen to the TV and let the little one sleep and not have to read everything in closed captioning. Once I figured out how to set the TV correctly, everything was great. There is occasional static depending on where I am sitting or laying, but I attribute that to the fact that the transmitter is set back in the cabinet since the cables are not long enough for better positioning.This thing is incredibly comfortable, I can wear for hours and they do no bother me at all, and it stays put. The volume knob is positioned to where, if you are resting your head on a pillow or the back of the couch, it gets turned, but that is my main complaint, and wouldn't return them because of it.Great product."
2,"Over rated, Had better sound and reception from $19 sets",Having read other reviews I elected to purchase this wireless headphone. What a disappointment. Surround sound must be turned off or you cannot decipher words in the sound track. I've experienced better quality from $19 wireless phones purchased from BigLots.
3,Ok but not good enough,"I bought these for late night gaming and TV time. I have a young baby and don't want to disturb him or momma! I have all of my av gear in a closet and my TV is wall mounted. I have used the turtle beach headphone for Xbox 360 but they are line of sight....So the transmitter cannot be hidden away in the closet. I found the sound on the sennheiser headphones to be about 80% of the turtle beach headphones. During muted or low audio moments there is a very noticeable hiss. I absolutely cannot stand this hiss. I have tried everything to get rid of it, but it remains. The turtle beach headphones work fine and sound better also, they also provide more bass response. So the sennheisers will be shipped back for a refund."
5,Great product and GREAT PRICE!,"This was a Christmas gift for my fiancee and I had went online to read other people's reviews on this item. This company shipped the product quickly even though it was the holidays. It arrived in wonderful conditon. The only thing I'd mention is that the packing slip had the total price paid on it. They should add a ""GIFT OPTION"" so that they may omit that info if the product is a gift.UPDATE: It has been over a year and my husband still uses these headphones every night to fall asleep to. Still works like new!"
1,I don't recommend these for private listening....,"These headphones play as load outside as they do in your ear. The silver mess area on the outsides of the headphones are a straight shot to the speaker. So folks around you get to hear what you're listening to at the same volume as you!I've never left a review on Amazon before but this ridiculous design flaw made me want to inform others. I purchased these on Amazon and am amazed no one else posted this remark. Hopefully this helps someone else steer clear of these if they are concerned with private listening.Now on the upside, other than the issue described above, these headphones are pretty darn good. The wireless technology works great and they are comfortable to wear.Just wish they would have put some thought into the noise pollution given off by these headphones. I mean, ear bud style headphones give off less noise!Buyer beware...."
5,Perfect for Apartments,"I live in an apartment in the city and have a surround system I rarely use. If I turn the system up loud enough to drown out city noises, my neighbors complain, hence, the perfect solution is the Sennheiser wireless. I can watch movies, shows, music with the headphone on and take care of tasks in the kitchen, throw out the trash, etc. without missing a beat. I'm no audiophile so everything sounds very true and in tune to me, even the surround feature. In fact, my movie and TV watching experience is enhanced because I never miss whispered dialogue or subtle sound effects with these headphones. The headphones themselves are constructed in a way that they don't pinch your head and provide just enough pressure from a 90 degree angle to your ears that they are quite comfortable even for excessively prolonged wearing. I like these quite a bit and they certainly have enhanced my home entertainment experience."
1,Those in Dorms! - BEWARE,"I live in a college dormitory and purchased these for listen to music + didn't want to get a wired one to chain me to my computer. Huge mistake. Whether it's due to the wireless internet floating around or causes unknown, the sound was awful. Hissing, popping,and a fuzz that made listening to anything impossible. Avoid these headphones!!! Mine are in the process of return right now."
4,Not Bad,"This headset is not bad. The sound is better than most, the headset is comfortable and the price is reasonable. The only complaint I have is the range. I've tried walking around the house with it to test the range and the signal seems to get weak at about 20-25 feet-you still get sound and if you stand in one spot the signal will eventually catch up to you, but you can definitely tell that you've gone too far from the base. For our uses it is a fine- my wife normally uses to watch TV."
2,Got noise if you're listening,"I use these headphones to listen to streaming audio through my computer. I have found that the noise (primarily hiss) is significant. I plug them into a Logitech surround sound unit and have to turn the volume all the way up on it, volume all the way up on my software volume control, and then turn down the volume on the headphones. If I don't, the hiss is intolerable. Additionally, I find the noise that the headphones pick up just walking a room away is large. I do not recommend them for walking around the house or going a significant distance from the base. With all the hiss they pick up I cannot call them audiophile quality."
5,good value,my second unit . I own a 120 and a 130. The 130 is more comfortable but no better reception.
3,"If you can't stand constant static, this is not for you","I bought the RS130 recently and I think it sounds great. But the range is notwhere closed to what it's box says, which is 100 meter *1/4 of a mile*. The moment I exited my room, it signal becomes weak. Also, I can't stand it when the signals aren't clear even if you hold the receiver right next to your head.Now, the range maybe up to 100 meter for all I know. But when you place the receiver near things such as a wireless routers and computers and TV and whatnot, I'm sure there's gonna be interference.I'll only suggest this if you are absolutely okay with constantly hearing the hissing sound. For me, I'm really bothered by it so I am either going to sell it on ebay or craigslist. Don't get me wrong tho, the sound it produces it way better than my $20 headphones. But I just can't stand hearing static while I'm listening to my mp3 or watching a movie."
2,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed by these headphones. The SRS mode distorted everything that it sounded like the speakers were blown. They are so big and clunky that I felt like a bobble-head when I wore them. And the reception was horrible. I expected so much more for $180.
4,Worth the money,"I like the performance of this ear phone, with one exception that may only apply to me or a few others. I don't use it for music much... I use it for TV drama, news, etc. Here any background music in the program (if there is any) is intensified and interfers a little with the spoken words. I would call this an annoyance rather than a deal-breakeer. I believe the phones are especially sensitive to musical sounds and thus would probably be best suited for those interested mostly in listening to music."
5,Sennheiser RS130 Wireless Headphones,Item received promptly; perfect condition; does just what it advertised; a little heavy. I would defintely recommend this item.
5,Really Good Wirless Headphones,"I did a lot of research on wireless headphones and the Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Headphones seem to have consistently good reviews. The RS 130's automatically connect to the base station and are clear with no static and have very good range. The headphones are recharged automatically by placing them on the base holder. However, if you forget to charge them, you can easily remove the rechargeabale batteries which come with the headphones and use regular batteries in them. Also they are very confortable to wear for extended periods - like a 3 or 4 hour football game. I have had other wireless headphones that cost more and didn't perform nearly as well as the Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Headphones."
4,Not bad at all,"This product is not bad at all. I live in a one room apartment with my girlfriend, so we figured it would be a good investment for when one of us would want to listen to music. Here are the basics:- Sound is good, though a little too much bass.- They are not ""noise-cancelling"", as I thought they would be. I have them on right now and I can here noise from the TV that's on low volume about 12 feet behind me.- They are comfortable.That's my initial reaction. Enjoy."
3,"Headphones okay- Not great, okay",The Sennheiser RS 115 are serving the purpose I bought them for (TV viewing late at night and computer audio) but they claim to do more and I find they can't. Their range is very limited. Even when I am right in front of the transmitter I can turn my head and hear popping and hissing. If I were buying these headphones for anything more than what I bought them for I would be extremely disappointed.
3,Only if you need to be quiet,"I experience a great deal of static depending on the position of my head while I'm wearing these headphones, so moving around for the best static free reception is a real bother, and then I have to ""freeze"" my position. Even with the comfortable ear cups, my ears will feel a little pinched long before a movie is over.The surround sound is not like a true 5.1 speaker system, but then, they didn't claim it would be.I might have been better off with a corded headphone, but then there's the bother of putting away the 15' cord.I do like the ability to move around the room, go to the kitchen, etc. without missing the sound, even though there will be some static coming and going as I move around."
5,better than expected,"These headphones are absolutely fabulous. I've read where some people complain about a noise they hear. Definitely if you turn up the volume on your television (remember it is muted in the room), you can then turn down the volume on your headset and you will hear everything crystal clear. They are so comfortable, I have fallen asleep with them on. In the morning, they are still playing and the battery held up all night. You couldn't ask for more in headphones. They are comfortable, reliable, quiet, give you good range. I have nothing to say negative about them."
4,Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones,"Excellent product for those hard of hearing...rest of family can have normal sound volume while headphones can be turned up louder. Great for watching TV while family is asleep. Excellent sound quality. Feels like you are in a theater. Only negative is, this is our 2nd headphone purchased because we have 2 different TVs and now neither will work properly when turned on together. Both headphones pick up opposite TV sounds and lots of static. But either turned on by themselves is superior sound quality."
4,Great!,The headphones are wonderful! They are for my husband and he loves them. The sound quality is great. The loud TV bothers me no more. Even my very hard of hearing 83 year old mother-in-law loves them - she could hear EVERYTHING on the TV.
4,"Not bad, for wireless","Pros: Pretty good sound, comfortable pads, seems to work well.Cons: Amp volume has to be up pretty high, otherwise you hear some static.I've been using these at about 8 foot range. Even at that range the volume has to be up relatively high, otherwise lots of static. Other than that, these work very well. I'd definitely recommend these for someone who wants to watch a movie without disturbing the neighbors, and still be able to get a beer from the fridge without taking the phones off. (They're quite comfortable -- sometimes I forget I'm wearing them.)"
4,"Good, but manage your expectations!","As others have said, there is definitely a background hiss, so don't expect high fidelity. That being said, I'm happy I bought it. I got it so I don't disturb my wife and baby. I mostly use it when gaming, and it does a good job of handling surround effects. I can hear things I couldn't catch with the speakers. They're also quite comfortable, and I don't notice my ears or the headphones getting hot, even after a few hours of use. If it weren't for the hissing, this would be a surefire 5 stars."
4,"Good headset, bad button locations","This headset is a replacement for my RS65. The sound is great, but so was my RS65. The RS130 is easier to recharge, holds its charge much longer and has better range, but the button location is terrible!! Especially the sound control. The sound is too easy to accidentally change. The RS6 is much better with regard to the button location, but you have to balance this with the duration of the battery life."
2,Too Much Hiss,"Too much hiss during quiet moments in movies, with soft music, and with spoken work programming."
2,Falls Off,"The sound quality of this product is wonderful but if I just put my head down to see what I am sewing in my lap, it falls off. If I am cooking and I glance down, it falls off. This is ridiculous. Do they not test these? I would not buy this product again. What good is good sound quality if they are sitting on the floor?"
1,Lost a Customer,"These hwireless headphones were the worst I've ever owned. Total static and no additional chanles found.When I tried to return them they let me know they did not take back returns on headphones. I shopped with Amazon after years shopping with ebay for that very reason. Just in case I needed to return them. Let's just say I will NOT be shopping on amazon for items like this again.beyond dissapointed,libby"
3,excellent product; questionable refurb,"I bought as a refurbushed unit... The unit is simply fantastic and highly recommended with the following warning; the refurb is a white box product; no paperwork, manual ect.. Virtually no warranty... Mine quit working for two weeks, then started working again; but for how long?"
1,I never received this product,"I wish I could give you a review of this product. Unfortunately, I never received it. After spending a lot of time trying to track it, I found out three weeks later that the item never shipped. Thanks Amazon. On top of this, you said the item is no longer available. Not true! But now if I want to order it again, the price has gone up, and there is no longer free shipping. Thanks Amazon."
1,Waiting for Return label,The phones give poor intermittent reception on every channel at my location. They don't hold the charge. After 16 hours of charging the uncharged warning beeper beeps all the time. I have been waiting since Spetember for a promised return label.I was called out of state for my stepdad's funeral. When I returend home I enededup in the hospital with kidney failure. Te eaerphines arrived while I was at the funeral.I discussed this three or four times with polite understanding Amazon agents all of whom promised to send a return label. They made an acception since I was sick and couldn't test or return the product before 30 days. Please send me a label soon.
4,Static sound,"I guess this is more of a shout for help :)I connected the system to my laptop, and there is a distinict static white noise that comes if I turn up the volume even a little bit above minimum. My Surround Input level light keeps flashing indicating Audio Input too low - don't know why. Didn't have any issues with my $10 headphones!Any help? Pls email kkarthikjgd AT gmail DOT comCannot really review, other than the fact that the battery wasnt fully charged when it came in!"
2,remanufactured whoops!,"I bought the remanufactured headphones about 3 weeks ago. They didn't work. I thought it was strange that no power source was included for the charging cradle, but a confusing insert with the manual seemed to say that the usa version would work by simply by plugging into the headphones jack. Accessory Genie, the supplier didn't have a clue. I tried to reach Sennheiser but got the usual run around choosing options and leaving messages. Finally, Accessory Genie sent a replacement unit. It didn't work either and no power source was included. I finally reached Sennheiser. Ultimately we figured out that at least some of the remanufactured units have been repackaged without the power unit. The headphones might be great but if you get a set w/o a power source, they don't work so good. I'm told my power source is on the way."
4,Sennheiser RS 130,"The set-up was easy...got right to the fun of listening to music. Range is good...could hear all over the house. Some static when receiving through several walls of the house away from the transmitter.There is an annoying delay when you first ""boot up"" the head set. But after that delay of about 10 seconds the headset receives just fine. Quality of sound reception is very good."
4,Awesome,"I purchased these headphones to watch TV late at night and listen to music while cleaning. They're perfect for me. They hiss a little when you first them on, especially with TV. After a few minutes though, they do sound amazing with nice surround sound. It comes with an adapter that I just plug into the headphone jack on both the TV and computer. Easy to setup and switch between the two. They are omfortable, sound great, are easy to setup, and are a steal for the overall quality."
2,Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones,"The product is probably fine, however, I didn't know when ordering that my TV had to have the correct plugs for it to work properly, my set is probably 15 years old and I don't have any plugs I can use to connect the earphones. Probably my own problem as my tv is so out of date with all the new technology. Your product information should maybe say something about what is needed to make a connection. Hopefully, I'll be able to use them if I ever get a newer TV."
4,Great sound for a moderate price,"These headphones give a respectable listening experience for a modest price. The range is good allowing you the freedom to travel all over the house without static or interruption. When using multiple headsets, it is necessary to mute the volume on the television to avoid feedback and a hollow sound. Individual volume control has given us a much happier television viewing experience."
4,Sennhieser RS 130 Wireless surround sound headphones,This product is easy to set up and has a great recharging system. The sound quality is great. I have absolutely no problems with the headphones while I am in the same room or adjacent rooms. I would not recommend buying these to listen to the tv while outside of the home.The only drawback to these headphones is the location of the volume control. Sometimes the volume is turned up/down by the pillow or sofa. If they put the volume on the front then those problems would be fixed.Over all this is a great product and I am glad I purchased them.
5,Great headphones,"Pros: easy to setup, adapters included, very good sound quality, comfortable, rechargable batteries last a long time,Cons: big (compared to many smaller headphones) but that is not important to me.Six Months Later: These headphones get a lot of use and the cushioned ear pieces have a fabric surface that becomes an increasingly 'less than new' condition from normal skin contact around the ears. I have ordered twice a new set of ear cushions at $10 a pair plus shipping. Instead of buying replacement ear cushions every couple of months a more economical fix was to buy a pair of men's black over-the-calf dress socks and then after each recharging cycle slip one sock completely over the headphones. Before the next recharge cycle remove the sock and throw in the wash. The controls on the headphone function ok with the sock on and the headphone stays newer and cleaner looking as it gets used."
5,Saved my marriage,"I am hard of hearing and these perform well, have used over 2 years with no problem. Love the wireless. Would buy again"
4,Great Choice1,Didn't have room for 5.1 speaker system plus receiver. Great and inexpensive ( under 150 bucks!) to achieve a reasonable substitute for 5.1 surround. Easy setup and user=friendly and comfortable. Do not hesitate to get these in lieu of speakers!
5,Senn earphones,"These are great! Block out all background noise, and the stand for recharging is very handy. I definitely give these an A+++"
4,"Great device, great price","A bit of hissing can be heard due to the wireless on this headphone, but generally really good value for the price.. and does a good job deadening the sound to people near you as well."
3,Much bigger than I thought,"I was looking for wireless headphones to wear at work - when I opened up the box I couldn't believe how large they were (felt like I was back in high school in the 70's). There was no way I could wear these at my office, so I returned them...with no problems I might add. So my 3 star rating has nothing to do with the sound quality or anything. Before buying online you may want to visit a brick and mortar and take a look at the physical size of headphones."
3,Way 2 Big,"They sound very good , great reception even when i am in the yard . they wore on very comfortable but was just way too big on my head . in todays world you would figure they would build wireless headphones that would be a little more slim & weigh less . i returned them to amazon & invested in the sennheiser hd595."
3,Unbearably HOT...,"I like the sound of these headphones. I have yet to test them going outside and all, but they performed fine in the rooms upstairs. I had gone through days of research before deciding on ordering these. I may yet have to send them back, for they get my ears unbearibly hot relatively quickly. I am having my wife test them right now, and I will give them a few more tries. If the problem persists however, I will need to return them, running the risk of not finding any satisfactory wireless headphones. It's very disappointing, for these seem to perform very well, but the heat that generates is very uncomfortable, not to say unbearable."
4,"Clear sound, works well",I purchased this item so my spouse could watch TV (in silence) while I was reading or studying in the same room. It was easy to install. The sound quality is clear and consistent for this purpose.I am completely satisfied with this product.
4,Best wireless headphone under $150,"Finally a wireless headphone with good range and decent fidelity. This headphone compares in sound quality to Sennheiser's wired headphones but has some low level noise during quiet passages and limited dynamic range.I owned the RS-120 but they were uncomfortable and even though the range and sound quality is similar to the RS-130, this headphone is extremely comfortable and the auto tuning feature is great. The SRS feature is nice for certain music and movie listening.Another reviewer was incorrect in that there IS a channel button on the side of the headphone, which allows you to pick the clearest channel."
5,Sennheiser Wireless Headphones(RS 130),"These headphones are awesome-they exceeded my expectations. My wife and I use them when we're on the treadmill; but realized I can wear them anywhere around our house or out in the yard, and still get crystal clear reception. Highly recommend if shopping for wireless headphones!"
3,Not good for recording,"The sound quality is pretty good. However, you will hear the ""electronic wind"" whooshing through the sound. Also, it has a very annoying habit of beeping then shutting down if there is no audio, so it's really annoying if you're stopping audio for more than 5 minutes."
4,wireless headphones,"This is a good product. It has nice sound and has good range, concidering it is wireless."
3,Less than I expected,Good sound and confort but less than satisfactory at distances it claims to cover. Very food near source.
5,JoeP,"These are great for TV watching. I can go into other parts of the house (even outdoors) without losing what it going on with the program that I am watching. I agree with other reviewers that the volume control has been put to near the channel control, causing me to accidentally switch what channels the sounds is coming over, but it is a minor problem. This set is so much better than cheaper brands that I have had in the past. I figure that by the time I had gone through the cheap brands, I had spent more than the RS 130 had cost me."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"The sound quality is good at very short ranges. They are pretty comfortable for under an hour of listening.What really doesn't make sense with these is the blasting of static after about 1 minute if you pause your source device. The transmitter (which is plugged into a wall outlet) just shuts off leaving only static for the battery operated headphones to blast.I listen to podcasts on them in the office and if I have to pause due to a phone call or a visitor, they end up blasting static unless you turn them off using a switch on the back, adding another step to the 15 second process just to pause and address something else.I think I actually hate these things, but they do deserve the second star for the quality they would provide in the right situation."
2,Almost a disposable product - banned in the bedroom,"THE GOODTHe design of these are quite nice. Very sturdy product.THE BADThe design of the volume dial is right where your head leans back in a chair or pillow. I got these so I can watch TV withoutIt interferes with mobile phones quite easily. The iPhone charging next to the nightstand would send nasty sounds to the headphones and the headphone stand was on the other end of the room.The pads on the head and the ears are a soft fabric and after a few uses they need to be washed or they will smell like old socks. This is not sweat, this is normal absorption from the head and face after 10 - 15 uses.The volume can be heard through the ear pads so everyone next to you can hear what you are listening to. Wife not happy about me using these in bed. She kicked these headphones out of the bedroom!Still shopping. I got the 130 because I figured they would have figured out the design issues by now."
4,Headphones work great,"I tend to watch TV and movies late into the night on weekends. I want to be able to enjoy the sound, yet not bother my wife who is trying to sleep immediately above our family room. These headphones work great. The sound quality is so good that I had to take them off the first time to assure myself that the sound was not coming through my speakers. I also like the fact that I can walk around my family room/kitchen area with no degradation in sound quality or volume. I have yet to run down the rechargeable batteries. I have noticed two minor problems, there is a small amount of hiss at some locations in the room, and the headphones shut themselves down if you mute the system and they don't receive a signal for a while. Also, be advised that when you first receive the headphones, the batteries truly do take about 14 hours to initially charge (as detailed in the manual.) I would not hesitate to recommend these, and in fact have recommended them to my mother-in-law."
1,RETURNS are a NIGHTMARE,"I was so excited to receive this product. It was my first experience with wireless products and I was looking forward to freedom of movement. However, what I found out was that because I live in a heavily populated area, there was alot of interference. I couldn't move around at all with out lots of hissing and squelching. After speaking with Sennheiser, I was told it may not be for me. Thus began the return, that has been horrible. Mine was purchased from Skybox via amazon. I will never buy from them again. All in all in will end up being a $50.00 mistake (including the restocking fees and shipping back and forth) I am bummed!This review is more about the company than the senn. product"
1,Do not use for a computer or laptop!,"I am greatly displeased with this headset. I wanted something wireless for use on my laptop but this thing is static city. It would drop channels like no tomorrow and constantly shut down. I've never had any problems with my wired ones. So, moral of the story, if it's too good to be true, it probably is."
3,Awesome..for a time.,"The sound quality is with these headphones, though a bit muddy in certain scenarios, is great for music. I would not recommend them for games, as this is where the muddy effect appears. Specifically, it can be difficult at times to pinpoint the location a sound is coming from in relation to the action on-screen. Also, there is a reason why additional headphones are available for this model. After about six months or so, the headphones just died. I even tried new batteries, and no damage was sustained by the RF unit itself. I took good care of the headphones and haven't decided to purchase a second unit.The feel of the casing surrounding the speakers, especially the plastic, feels as if it could break at any moment. It is possible that the transmitter itself has had an internal failure of some sort, as I can still hear the on/off beeps through the headphones yet cannot hear the sound being transmitted via the computer that I hooked them up to."
4,pretty good once they get going,"good points:good soundeasy chargingstylishvery comfortablebad points:slight hiss at higher volumescould be loudertakes 16 hours to charge battery's initially (i'm impatient, wanting to try out my new toy)for some reason i had to unplug it and take out the battery's for a couple of minutes to get it to workoverall fairly happy with them"
2,Poor performance - Not worth of 115$,I had ordered this product based on very high ranking in several reviews. But I was very disappointed with the performance. The Noise was beyond acceptable level. The frequency output was flat. Lows abd Highs are missing which give a very dull feeling. I have a Sony XBR4 TV and tried with outputs from DirectTV/PS3/DVDs etc. I did not find it suites anything. May be it is good for just News and I am sure you do not want to spend 115$ for that. I returned it and the return was very easy and smooth. I was very happy the way Return was handled.I got Sony Model: MDR-RF970R from best buy and this has a better sound quality although much less then decent quality. Probably you cannot expect much from 100$ wireless Headphones.
3,Wireless headphones have limitations,"These headphones provide adequate performance for gaming but probably not for serious music listening. There is a moderate amount of static which definitely interferes with quiet music passages. If you intend to listen to music, I would suggest a wired pair of headphones such as the Sennheiser HD 555. On the other hand, wireless headphones are far more convenient than a wired pair. I solved the problem by purchasing both types."
4,GO WIRELESS!,"light weight, good sound. there is a small hiss during silent moments. Battery life is good so far!"
2,wireless headphones,Other people might like these headphones but my pair is bad. The headphones continually cut out and lose reception. They also have a bad hissing in them when they are on. I don't know if I'm missing something but I would not recommend these to anyone.
4,"So-so sound quality vs wired, but good overall","Only get these if you absolutely MUST have wireless. You can get better sounding wired headphones for way cheaper.Spent $120 on these (and that's a lot for a pair of headphones). Honestly for $100+ I expected better sound quality, but hey it's RF.. Good things first - probably most comfortable headphones I've had so far. Very well thought out design. I like! Charging doc is stylish. Surround feature I found pretty useful - need ON for some sound; off for others. Too bad you can't adjust it on earphones directly (switch is on the dock).Bad: no dedicated bass/treble adjustment (but you can adjust from the source so that's ok). Sounds quality is pretty good but not great. I can definitely hear the difference vs my wired Sony headphones. Especially between the songs (or on pause) you head a bit of hissing.These are for watching movies/playing games w/o disturbing people in the next room, which is what I need them for anyway."
4,Excellent Audio,"This wireless headset works well. Easy to set up and use. My only gripe is that I used the external headphone adapter which extends beyond the outline for the receiver. That makes it easy to bump into. Other than that, the Sennheiser product lives up to its reputation for clear audio and excellent range. I learned quickly that increasing the volume into the transmitter easily fixed any of my issues with audio quality or backgound noise. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to the radio in private without disturbing a spouse or parent."
2,poor set up manual,"THE MANUAL IS NOT DEFINITIVE ENOUGH TO INSTALL ON A 1995 PIONEER RECEIVER AND A 52"" MITSUBISHI TV. NO ILLUSTRATIONS TO ASSIST IN THE INSTALLATION.I TRIED SEVERAL CONNECTIONS TO THE OUTPUT PLUGS ON THE RECEIVER AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE HEAD SET TO FUNCTION FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN IT WOULD QUIT.TECH SUPPORT DID NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. THEY DID RESPOND TO MY PHONE CALL AND TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO TRY DIFFERENT VOLUME SETTINGS ON THE RECEIVER TO FIND A SETTING THAT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE HEAD SET. TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW VOLUME SETTINGS WOULD CAUSE THE HEADSET TO TURN OFF AFTER A FEW MINUTES (WHICH WAS MY EXPERIENCE). I COULD NOT FIND A COMPATIBLE VOLUME SETTING THAT WOULD WORK.I PLAN TO TRY ONE MORE TIME BY PLUGGING INTO THE TV ITSELF AND TRY THE VOLUME SETTING SEARCH AS SUGGESTED BY THE TECH SUPPORT.IF THAT DOES NOT WORK, I PLAN TO RETURN THE PRODUCT FOR A REFUND.SINCERELY,LYNDA MARQUARDT"
5,Headset,All the headset you could ask for to watch television. The dialogue comes through more clearly than through the TV speakers. Big help for the hearing impaired.
5,Sennheiser Wireless Headphones are worth the extra $,"This is my third set of Sennheiser Wireless Headphones. I tried several other brands (Sony,RCA) and had to return them. They did not have the range and sound quality of the Sennheiser systems. Weather on my TV or my computer system, the Sennheiser Headphones are worth the extra $."
3,Sounds Good!! Built Bad,"The sound quality from the equipment is very good, the comfort is also good. What I found irritating was the location of the volume and channel selection button. First you press the wrong button to get volume...but you get used to it later and get better, second if you lie down with the headphones ON to watch TV, you pillow will increase or decrease the volume, depending on how you rest. The ON/OFF switch also looks cheap, looks as if it will fall of in few weeks, you can see a better ON/OFF switch in a $5 Walmart toy. If you want the review in a NUTSHELL, its a Geo Metro car with BMW M5 engine !!"
4,DECENT SURROUND SOUND QUALITY,"I ENJOY USING THESE HEADPHONES AROUND THE HOUSE. EXCELLENT SOUND AND MINOR HISSING. ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS WHEN I GO OUTSIDE AND I AM STILL WITHIN THE DISTANCE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN GOOD QUALITY, I GET MAJOR HISSING. A GREAT SOURCE FOR INSIDE HOUSE ONLY. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OUTSIDE USE. I LIKE THEM, BUT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BETTER QUALITY THROUGH THE WALLS OUTSIDE. I LIKE PURE MUSIC WITHOUT HISSING."
1,Very disappointed,"After reading all the reviews I purchased this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he's been wanting a pair of wireless headphones for months. I received two headsets and returned both because of extremely poor reception. Laying in bed, 5 feet from the receiver, the headphone volume would inexplicably drop after about 5 minutes of listening. Sometimes turning the TV on and off would fix it. We thought the first set might be defective but then the second set did the exact same thing. Too bad... I'll be looking for another set."
5,They are Sennheiser's afterall!,Great headphones. Sennheiser enjoys a good reputation for a reason. Good quality and performance at a reasonable price.
4,Wonderful Easy Free Feeling Headphones!,"Easy to install with just 1 small issue.The battery may not align correctly within one side of the head phone as there is what appears to be a small twisted paper clip as a battery terminal contact for positive. Once I figured out and corrected that the positive terminal wasn't getting good contact, the headphones worked great! I just needed to pull the batteries out and put them back in again.I could not beat Amazon's price for this higher end level of head phones at $60! I had been eying these head phones when they were twice that price, so I am really happy that I waited.Range is very good. I can walk around the house or even go to the garage to get something without missing a beat. Handy for watching ball games and you simply need to step away. If a crucial play is coming up, you have a clue because the excitement comes through the head phones prompting you to run back before you miss the whole play!"
2,Sounds like a rainstorm,"I've had this headset for almost two years. When there's not much interference they sound excellent and I like the surround processing. It really works, sometimes it sounds as if the speakers are on and I have to turn the headset off for a moment just to be sure there's no sound in the room. However, some nights the interference is so bad I can't use them, and even on a good night there's plenty of crackling in the background. Earlier tonight the interference sounded like a rainstorm, then it reduced suddenly as if someone in another apartment turned off an appliance. It's not a gain issue, or distance from the antenna. The computer volume and the media player volume are all the way up, and the transmitter is 3 feet from me. It just seems to operate on a frequency that's dirty with interference from other devices. The digital wireless headsets are more expensive, but lately the interference has been pretty bad and I really wish I would've saved up for a digital version."
4,Use them all the time. Works great.,"Works great, there is some accassion static if you turn your head just right. Also, they need to be digital. Some of the new tvs do not use the rca connections for headphones."
5,First i was affraid.. now im satisfied,"So this is the first time i bought wireless headphones, i was initially weary because i kept reading reviews about hissing and poor quality and even worse shot transmission distance. Well i decided on the RS130 based on a review from an audio guy, and i am very happy. This hardware was easy to use and set up, there was hissing at first but you hit the tune button once or twice and it optimizes the sound quality. I havent tested the distance yet but it works great even when i move around."
3,"Comfortable to wear, but has static","These head phones are comfortable to wear, but they do have a bit of static. We use them at a range of about 15 feet. We've tried moving the transmitter around, and we know it's not because of interference from the display (we have a wall mount). Despite the slight static, we use these almost every day so it is not a huge impact. If we could make another purchase, we'd probably go with a different model because at over $100, it seems they should be crystal clear."
2,Surround all over,"Not too impressed specially after previously owning a different brand. The sound is fair. I purchase the RS 130 to listen to TV after my wife goes to sleep, unfortunately this does not contain the sound within its ear muffs.Anyone near you can still hear the sound from the headphones unless its volume is turn down very low."
4,Best I've used but a little RF static is present,"Let me start off with, VERY COMFORTABLE. Rechargeable batteries came with the unit. Good range, minimal static that ""goes away"" when you get into whatever you are listening to. The simulated surround mode is nice. Sennheiser makes quality products. I don't know for sure, but I would think that IR(infrared) transmitted headphones would produce less static. I believe all these RF(radio frequency) transmitted headphones will always have a little static hiss to them.I would buy these again for a hundred bucks."
4,Summer and winter,"In her husky maturity, Joni Mitchell can still be highly evocative. Many of the songs on this album are done in a peculiar layering style of recording, sometimes with wonderful results (""Passion Play"", ""Slouching Toward Bethlehem"") and sometimes middling. The title song and the final track, ""Two Grey Rooms,"" are good explorations of the emotional poles, joy and sorrow, yet both are equally wistful. ""Come In From the Cold"" is a long and catchy hit."
5,a masterpiece,simply joni's most beautiful album .. the words drip with honesty and depth of character. the combination of the lyrics and the layered mix is simply beautiful. love cherokee louise.. a must for all true music lovers
4,This effort is proof that refinement comes with age.,"It has been nearly a year since I last listened to this recording, however, the timbre and the melodic content are hauntingly fresh in my ears. Joni's voice and lyric carry a seasoned perspective on these extraordinarily observed stories of passion and resignation. Even with the sustantial contributions of the well enlisted musicians, each of the tracks on this broad palette of ideas elicits an image of Joni Mitchell's infectious work. The album is delightfully provocative collection of novels for the intensive listener."
4,Wonderful and totally underrated,"Like most avid Joni fans I first came across her work through Blue and Court and Spark - only later starting to collect her later albums too. Having now bought all her albums apart from Dog Eat Dog I can honestly say that this is one of her very best, and I totally agree with the other reviewer who said this is an underrated record.With the possible exception of Ray's Dad's Cadillac, every song is a gleaming gem, the wonderful vocals, powerful lyrics and simple acoustic guitar arrangements sounding so much better than the over-produced stuff Joni produced in the 80s. The title track alone is worth the price of the CD and the haunting Come In From The Cold has to be one of Joni's most beautiful songs ever. I would (of course!) give Blue and The Hissing Of Summer Lawns 5 stars and although I totally love this album and think it is one of Joni's best 3 or 4 albums, it isn't quite as revolutionary as the Hissing."
5,The Master of Haunting Music,"From the first moment I heard his haunting piano pieces, I knew I must buy a CD with his best music, which from what I've heard, is just about anything. For anyone who wants to hear music that will stay in your memory long after listening to it, even though it seems to be simple notes on a piano, this CD collection is definitely the place to start."
2,Too much fluff,"Went for the Sever test full of way too much info from this book. I was so spread out as far as a focus on the test, that simple questions became hell with over analysing the situation (ie how to install a SCSI card which I have done hundreds of times, but got so concerned from this book that nothing was as easy as I thought it was). Use the Exam Prep book it is much better. Lisa puts way too much fluff in to her writing. She is very distracting with her focus."
4,Excellent book to pass the Exam,This book is an Excellent review source to pass the NT Server 4.0 exam. But you would still need other source of NT Server book to get more detail information for the exam. Would recommend to purchase. Worth the $$$.
3,works but not fast enough,"takes a lot of time to charge ...and it does not have indicator light to tell when it is done charging. I have a couple of chargers, this one is just one more"
1,AWASOME BAD PRODUCT!!! - DO NOT BUY EVEN FOR A PENNY!!,"4 of the 4 rechargeable batteries worked for me for the 1st week - but after that both the charger and the batteries stopped working!The indicator lights were never ON when I put the charger into the plug. I would spend 15 dollars more to buy a Sony or Panasonic Charger. But I will never buy TechB, its terrible. I Hope Amazon takes the advice of no sell such bad things. It's indeed a total waste of money!!"
3,OK for its price,It is an awkward device. The cells are not easy to fit in and sometimes pop out. The LED does not light if the cells are loose. But there is no indication when the batteries are charged. Keep in mind - these batteries are not the same as the 1.5V batteries you want in a digital camera.
1,This producct is a waste of money,"I bought the charger and charged batteries twice following its instruction for 15 hours. Then, the charger stopped working at all. I contacted Tech B's customer services several times through their website. They don't respond. The company's website only allows us to email them, and there is no info of their phone numbers. I strongly recommend you purchase other chargers, unless you want to burn some $10 extra."
5,Great,Having been using the kit for some time now and the batteries have handled recharging quite well without any loss of power retention
2,Don't bother with this. They do not keep a charge!,"After charging the batteries for 3 days they were ready to use. I tried them in my Olympus D-580. After 3 pictures the battery light started flashing, after 2 more pictures they died. I tried the other 2 batteries and the same thing happened. I would not buy these again, and wish that I could return this, but I threw out the packaging......Don't waste your money!"
2,It does charge batteries,"This thing does charge batteries, when it's plugged in. It's getting the stubby prongs to stay in the outlet when filled with heavy batteries that's the problem, and it's a pretty big problem."
5,Charlie is back with a vengence!!!!!!!!,"Charlie is a musical icon. This single is sooo hot! He has not lost his ability to make wonderful tunes that appeal to listeners both young and old.I grew up listening to the GAP Band, and Charlie's voice has not changed one bit. He is on the RISE. A word to the wise, get in on this hot single while you can. It is a fabulous ballad, with more good stuff to come.Look out for more good stuff from Charlie!! You won't be sorry!"
3,Buyer Be Aware,"In a moment of incaution and foolishness, without reading the reviews and relying upon blurbs and the reputation of the author, I purchased ""In the Image of God""; so if I was dissatisfied with the expenditure of my money, it was entirely my own fault. This is not to say the book is without merit; as a systematic rundown of major books dealing with American black slavery and therefore as a reference guide to basic historiography of the subject for undergraduates, it could hardly be bettered. But, if I had wanted to read book reviews, I would have gone to H-Net. And that is all this book is, book reviews, good ones, but still, frustrating if one was looking for a bit more."
2,"If you like D. B. Davis, don't run out and buy this book.","I am a great fan of Davis's earlier books on slavery. This book is a disappointment and I am sorry to say I think he wrote it for the money and no other or good reason. My feeling is so negative I can't bring myself to go into what he says or does not say. Review it carefully before buying and don't be suckered into buying it by the author's name.Shame on you, Professor Davis."
3,It's ok,"I was hoping the accompanying booklet would have been a little more detailed, it only skims the surface of early music"
1,"Wide survey, now outdated","This book appears to be a reprint of a book released in 1981. It covers a wde variety of useful subjects. However, the examples shown and many of the techniques and materials described in the book are dated. Modeling techniques and standards have advanced well beyond this book. Best to leave this one for the used book aisle."
2,tisk.,"Being the mark that I am for movie gimmicks, I purchased this film in hopes of seeing more of the flying guillotine which I have become so fond of over the years. ... It's nothing more than a jug attached to a chain. Granted, we're talking about a flying guillotine but come on. If you want to see a real flying guillotine movie, wait a month or so and watch ""master of the flying guillotine."" I beleive it comes out into theatres next month."
2,"carter wong with a good acting performance and a bad ass old man, otherwise a pretty bad kungfu flick","watch carter wong dodge guillotines for 5 minutes at a time. the guillitines move AT ABOUT 1-2 MILES PER HOUR. It is so freaking boring when the action actually happens. Luckily they mix in some hand to hand, but I honestly think that THIS movie has the most close up flips that I have ever seen in a movie. Flying guillotine 1, 2, and wang yu's are good but this doesn't even fall into the same category."
5,Awesome part at price to beat the locals,"My Winnipeg mechanic said he could get ignition coils for between $170 and $200 each locally. I nearly fainted, but once recovered did a quick search at Amazon. These were available with Amazon Worldship (in this case, arrived via DHL), and my single ignition coil arrived next business day and was installed effortlessly. As a Florida snowbird I'm used to using my Prime account to source things quickly and economically while in the US. When in Canada I'm at a loss as to where to turn. Hopefully more of the selection of Amazon USA will be made available in Canada, especially auto parts."
4,A good replacement part,"I was surprised when the original ignition coil went out in my 330ci, but this replacement part did the job. An inexpensive replacement part for a quick fix."
1,Gobble-dee Guk,"This book is almost impenetrable. Utterly incomprehensible. This book was written for advanced experts in the murky field of philosophy of religion -- I would guess that .00001% of the world's population can understand this stuff. What is the deal? Why would anyone write such a book that is utterly and totally impossible to understand?If you like sentences like this, you are gonna love this book:""It may be worth exploring a possible metaphoric relation between the semiotic realm and its possible capacity to mirror exotic ontology in the context of original creativity.""Got that?"
5,EXCELLENT PAGE TURNER,We picked this book for our Book Club and it has proved to be one of our all time favorites. Harold Norman is an excellent writer and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat. I am now looking forward to reading his other 2 novels. Do not pass this one up.
3,"Good atmosphere, poor payoff at the end.",That's about it really. It's well written and has a good setting but the ending felt weak and I kind of cringed when learned what the title meant because I was hoping for something more clever.
5,never heard anything like trans am before. it is excellent,"Trans am is a great chicago band that has created a whole new sound. I definately recommend purchasing the Japanese import albums over the U.S. releases. They have extra tracks that are well worth the money, especially on Survelence. definately a band worth checking out."
4,Highly Recomend,Great information on a wide array of disorders. Well written although at times lengthy.
5,One of the greatest movies ever made,"This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. From beginning to end it holds your attention. The action is phenomenal and the sense of romance keep you hoping for the best. Very seldom will I comment on a movie,but this one needed my voice."
2,"Good movie, but....","...It's dubbed in English. Unacceptable. Some people in America would much rather read the subtitles, than listen to horrible dubbing."
1,BEYOND HYPOTHERMIA,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM AND I HAVE HAD NO RESPONCE FROM THE COMPANY I ORDERED FROM. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH AMAZON
3,"""Starship"" and ""Non-Stop"" - the same book, different editions","There is a review on Amazon that says that Aldiss's ""Non-Stop"" is a SEQUEL to his ""Starship"". Au Contraire! They are the same book, different editions. Starship was written and copywrited in 1958. Non-Stop was copywrited in 2000, most recently published in 2005.On the back cover of Non-Stop, it says that ""This...[is] Starship...updated for the twenty-first century.""Here is what Brian Aldiss says about the two books:""For this new edition of an old favorite, I have made some alterations here and there. These occur on 48 pages [193 remain the same]. The adventure remains the same; the characters remain the same; the theme of an idea gobbling up real life remains the same. Only a few words have been changed. But of course a few words make all the difference.""-B.W.A.So, don't do like I did and get both expecting Non-Stop to be a sequel. My first clue was that the two Table of Contents were exactly the same. Just thought you'd like to know."
2,great content but horrible presentation,"This is the first textbook that I've ever purchased (or been given) that was so poorly printed. After two monthes of light use, 75+ pages have fallen out with more on the way. Additionally, as other reviewers have noted, the type is faint and the pictures are grainy. When I received it, I thought it was a copy of a copy of a copy. It's that poor. I called the publisher and unfortunately, this is the only version available. That said, it's a disappointment not only because it cost ~$100 but also because the content is really great and would make a solid reference book for many years to come."
3,Pretty Good!!!,"This movie was a little bit better than I expected, but I probably won't watch it again for quite a while. Some scenes were tense and suspenseful. Everybody did an awesome job. Gyllenhaal and Maguire play two brothers named Tommy and Sam Cahill. When Sam goes missing in action, Tommy spends more time with Sam's wife, Grace and his two little girls. After a few months, Sam is found and is traumatized. He starts accusing Tommy of sleeping with his wife and becomes angry very easily. I'd probably recommend BROTHERS!!!"
3,Worth watching,"Just finished watching this movie. It was not quite what I was expecting, but it was a good movie. The performances were superb. I wasn't too pleased with the ending, but overall it was well done."
1,bull,"If it were not for the completely bogus military portions of this movie, maybe it would have been good. I took the dvd out when the Cpt bludgeoned his soldier to death to save himself. Bull.The body of these two were not recovered, so they would not have been listed as K.I.A. in the first place. Just because of situations like this and the fact that in todays world, that helicopter crash site would have been found and the bodies recovered.I can't recommend this movie at all and I will think long and hard before I ever watch Toby Mcquire or Jake Gyllinhaal again in a movie."
2,Oh Brothers,"This movie simply ran out of steam when it should have been revving it up. It lost me at the point where Brother Tom kissed the wife, and then went ..... where? Really seemed like the screenwriters didn't know how to imbue the story with the kind of conflict and emotion it needed."
2,Did NOT like this movie at all!,"I had really big expectations of this movie, based on the ""explosive emotional"" tv trailers and commercials....shoulda just stuck with that. Tobey was very robotic and unconvincing as a ""loving Dad"" BEFORE he was deployed again. There didn't seem to be any chemistry with him as a Dad. I felt overall the acting was forced and didn't evoke any real emotions. I am very sensitive to emotional movies and this really didn't do it for. (Hey, I cried in CARS when Lightning pushed The King over the finish line!). The movie had lots of cliche type cheese (so bring the Triscuits!). The movie was (for me) disconnected on many levels and cold heartless acting all around...except the little girl. The ending was a big let down too and it seemed that there could have been lots more to do with it then what was done. Golden Globe worthy? I think not."
5,Excellent cast and awesome story!,"It's very rare to have a new movie now a days with this much impact. The casting was perfect...down to the little kids. I would totally recommend this movie to anybody. Even kids, despite the fact it does contain some bad language. I think the youth of America could benefit from a film like this. 5 stars, all the way around!"
4,Brothers,pretty good story. I was glad I purchased it. The actors did a good job. I would watch again sometime in the future.
3,expected it to be better,don't want to spoil it for others...it was interesting and good acting...just expected it to be a real affair with the brother and not just 1 little kiss...could have been great if she had to struggle with the decision of who to stay with
3,Interesting,"I liked this movie, but I felt like I was watching an episode of my favorite soap opera.It was all to easy to know what was going to happen next. The acting by all the charactersespecially the little girls was very good."
3,Realistic but a little flat,"Filmakers are starting to make hay with stories from the past 10 years of America's wars in the Middle East. Here, it's the age-old tale of two brothers, one bad and one good, who end up dueling over a woman and only one can come out a winner. There's a side plot involving some torture in Afghanistan. Really, only Jake Gyllenhaal does a pretty good acting job here. Tobey Maguire comes off as too shell shocked and blank for most of the film. Natalie Portman is neither here nor there as the long-suffering military wife. The end is unsatisfying."
5,"AMAZING cast, story, film","Jake G. Toby M. & Natalie P. are amazing in this film! I love it. The product came on time as well.Imdb says: Before leaving on his second tour in Afghanistan, Marine Captain Sam Cahill, a leader, an athlete, a good husband and father, welcomes his screw-up brother Tommy home from prison. He'd robbed a bank. In country, Sam's helicopter is shot down and all are presumed dead. Back home, while Sam wastes away as a prisoner in a remote encampment, Tommy tries to take care of the widow and her two children. While imprisoned, Sam experiences horrors unbearable, so when he's rescued and returns home, he's silent, detached, without affect, and he's convinced his wife and brother have slept together. Demons of war possess him; what will silence them?"
4,A++,"This movie was incredible, and it's now on my list of A++ movies. I watched it solely based on reviews and now I understand why it got such a high rating.Tobey Maquire, Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman, Sam Shepard ... the list would be to long to name all of the actors that outdid themselves with solid and convincing performances.It's a serious and heartwrenching story that (thankfully) sheds light on the trauma that so many soldiers endure while defending their country. I've heard firsthand accounts from veterans describing their experiences, and this film brings home the fact that war is a devastating, life-altering event for both the victims and the participants."
2,Miscast,"It's not only that Tobey Maguire was not up to playing a paranoid marine POW here. It's just so obvious Jake Gyllenhaal was born to play THAT role instead of the slacker brother. The major plot points are also handled in a bland awkward ""TV movie-ish"" way. I cringed at the sappy ending narration over an uplifting U2 power ballad. This guy is way damaged...why sugar coat it? Finally, the father-son relationship was barely covered at all."
4,Entertaining but Sad,Good casting...Brings home the personal horrors of the aftermath of war. One is never the same after experiencing the combat zone. It is particularly true for those captured and tortured.
4,good deal,The price was great and it was shipped in time to go under our Christmas tree even though it wasnt promised until Jan.
1,very weak movie,This movie has a very weak story line. It's almost a disrespect to the men and women who put their lives on the line. You'd expect a good intelligent movie would be made about the realities they face.
3,Fell a little short,"Brothers could have been a very moving story. For me it fell short, as the story seemed under developed, even though the intended message was clear. The ending was sudden, and left me feeling a bit cheated. It is really too bad, as this movie could have been a power house with more elaboration. For me it was just ok."
5,Very Good! (:,"After being shot down in Afghanistan and presumed dead, a soldier's return home is fraught with emotional upheaval for his whole family."
2,"Oh, brother","I am amazed with some of the reviews I've read stating the casting in this movie was spot on, now I don't mean to knock Tobey Maguire as an actor but in my mind he does not fit the description of his character one bit, that's the first thing I have a problem with in this film. The other thing is the plot of the film, this had the potential to be a really great movie if they had of made it more about Jake and Natalie's characters becoming more romantically involved without the audience knowing Maguire's character is still alive until much later into the film. Instead it became more about how Maguire's character deals with life after being tortured in Afghanistan. Anyway that's just my opinion."
1,Un-American,"This is one of the more sickeningly anti-American movies i have ever seen. And at a time when service members are at war and dying and really need the country's support. Is there nothing these ""celebrities"" aren't willing to defile to put money in their pockets? They should all be ashamed."
4,Good emotional movie,"The best thing about the movie is, it allows you to step into all the characters shoes and feel what they are feeling. The movie is very powerful and is one of the best of the year."
5,Can't ask for much more!,"I have watched many movies that have sort of the same story line but out of all of those, I don't think there is one even comparable to how great this movie is. It is almost perfect in every category! There is never a dull moment in this movie... it was very powerful/moving for me and when people ask me what my favorite movie is, I always tell them ""Brothers"" because of how well the movie was put together."
5,overwhlemed by this film!,"I saw this film when it was theatrically released in 1968. It is one of the most beautifully photographed pictures of all time. Roeg is a genius behind the camera. Richard Rodney Bennett's score is perfection. Finch, Bates, Stamp, Christie and Ransome are at the pinnacles of their acting careers. You can't go wrong with a Hardy story. I had owned the tape and laser disc versions for years. Amazon.co.uk now sells the movie on DVD. The video and audio transfer could have been of better quality but if you own a region free player, don't hesitate. Warner Home Video should give another try with a high quality DVD version (including extras) that will live up to the brilliance of this significant work of cinema."
1,avoid this,The new DVD is a disaster--still cropped rather than 2.35x1 and lacking the original stereo soundtrack. Warner Bros. has botched a great opportunity to present this beautiful film in the manner it deserves.
1,"Should be titled ""Far From the Boring Crowd!""","Caught this movie on TCM this morning (Thursday, April 14th,2011), after not having seen it for a number of years. As I recall, this film was not a box-officesuccess, despite the stellar cast. And since I have had this day's review-ing, I can see why. I kept thinking, Why is she attracted to that jackass of a sargeant?Why aren't the guys running out of the barn to rescue the hayricks, I mean, they are farmers first, partiers second. I can honestly say it bored me to death, andI was very glad to have to run an errand, and stop watching this BORING film!Buy it ONLY if you are A Hardy enthusiast, but otherwise, rent, or wait for TCM torun it again. I certainly would NOT waste the dineros to buy it!Sad to say, I give it a thumbs down. Gorgeous photoplay, but material bored thepants off me."
5,About time!,"Just finished watching the new dvd release of the 1967 movie Far from the Madding Crowd.........great picture(would be even better with a blue ray player) very good sound, proper format and they even added 3 minutes. I was preparing to be disappointed but am extremely happy to donate my old vhs copy and add this dvd to my library. The only thing keeping this movie from being an absolute masterpiece is that it is a little long and the ending was for me a little flat emotionally, but maybe more in keeping with the novel by Hardy............worth watching! Not sure which copy the other disappointed reviewer saw --if you liked this movie at the theater you will not be disappointed. Now if only the 1998 version would come out for our region..........."
5,What's not to love?,"Amy Grant is my favorite vocalist and song writer. Her songs are ageless and meaningful, just like she is! I love her music!"
3,Hit&Miss,the title alone makes the book more interesting than what comes out overall.while the Book offers some interestign details on certain topics like alot of other readers too much time is spent on Diana Ross&Not enough on the music itself.still it has some moments.
1,A Total Waste Of Your Money,"Posner's book is nothing more than rehashed stories and urban myths. When it comes to the music, he more often than not, gets it all wrong. This book is full of mistakes regarding when songs were released, who recorded them first, on and on and on...As bad as Tony Turner's book was, I'd recommend it any day over this trash. Hardly any of the label's singers appear to be happy about ever having recorded there. Diana Ross once again gets kicked around and blamed for everyone's lack of sustained sales and stardom. Big surprise there. And his recent appearance on the E! True Hollywood Story about Diana Ross - what happened, they couldn't get Mary Wilson to talk about how evil Ross is, so they carted out Mr. Posner who's never even met her? For a more balanced story about Motown, real Nelson George's ""Where Did Our Love Go"", if you can."
3,Interesting..but!,"This is an interesting book on Motown and Berry Gordy, if this is your first venture into the area. As it turns out, I had first read Berry Gordy's book ""To Be Loved"" about six months back. Unfortunately perhaps the largest part of this book is quotes from Gordy's book so it is much like reading the Gordy book again. There were a few areas Posner got into, that Gordy did not, but essentially it was a rehash. As far as the overall read, for information gained, I liked the Gordy book better, and I did not feel this book added any startling or shocking insight."
2,Ho-hum...,"Gerald Posner takes time off from his career as a mealy-mouthed, Intelligence approved conspiracy ""expert"" to write about Motown. As usual, his facts are skewed & large portions of his work is cribbed from other sources. Ho-hum..."
1,Thank God I didn't buy this for myself!,"This book was nothing more than a collection of excerpts from other peoples (auto)biographies.That's it. Since he was unable to obtain interviews with any of the subjects,perhaps the author thought that putting in court documents would give the book some credibility....uh, no!I'm happy that I didn't spend the money to buy it in its Hardcover edition(it was a gift), though I have to live with it collecting dust in my cellar!"
2,Don't waste your money on this one....,"I've read probably every book ever written about Motown and it's artists. This book is nothing new. I've heard it all before. ... If you haven't read any other books on Motown, this one is OK. For a general review, I'd give it a ""ho-hum."""
2,Off The Charts,"The genuine interesting story of Motown should be dedicated to the amazing catalogue of hit songs. Where this book falls off the charts for me is all the stuff about personal lives that adds nothing but sensationalism about world-famous people. Do we really need to know who screwed (in the real sense or otherwise) whom? It reads like one of TV's ""inside reporting"" jobs on celebrities, and maybe that's the wide audience the writer is trying to tap into. Motown was about the music. That, however, is just the starting platform of this book and quickly left behind. For me, the rest of the data is a Big Who Cares?"
3,"Ras Kass "" Institutionalized""","If I was rating this album on lyrics alone - I'd give it 6 stars... but I think the production really brings this CD down. It's not bad, but Ras Kass is one of the greatest lyricists in hip hop and he deserves more. I know it's a mix CD, but it's really inconsistent from song to song. I feel like if he ( and so many other great lyricists ) kept their albums to just a few quality producers, you'd get stronger overall effort. If you like Ras Kass though, PICK THIS UP ( the lyrics alone are worth hearing )."
3,just average,"This is just not his best, Ras Kass has always been a great lyricist but i feel this is average by standards. For other artist this would be great but for him this is pretty average and if he is going to continue to have subpar production then he will need to come with the lyrical prowness he exhibited on soul on ice."
5,Better than the OEM Adapter,"I bought this adapter to replace the spiral corded one that came w/my RoadMate 360. The cord length on the OEM adapter was too short and the adapter would often come loose from the RoadMate. When I went to look for a longer one on Magellan's website, I saw they only had the same short adapter cords and they were all out of stock. Decided to look for one on eBay and Amazon. Amazon had the one I was looking for: long, non-spiral. This new adapter cord is great, the cord length is excellent and the connection tight. I'm very pleased!"
5,Power Adapter ...,"Works great. The fuse kept blowing in our old one and we took a chance to see if this one would work. It did work, but the problem still remained. We discovered the antenna was a little loose. After we tightened the antenna, we were on the road again!"
5,Works as promised,"This item replaces the manufacturer-supplied cord. Seems sturdier than the original, which cracked when I tried to remove it from the auto plug."
4,"great music, iffy sound quality","Barrueco is an exceptionally musical player and he has a great feel for this music. However, the sound quality of the CD is variable from track to track. My husband, for whom I bought the CD, thought it was lacking in bass on some numbers, and I thought it sounded somewhat muffled on others. It's still great music if you are into 20th century classical guitar music, played by a great guitar player."
5,nice dvds,the dvds worked well haven't had a problem yet. I used to put some videos from camera and got the job done. So I'm happy this this product
5,Great book by Dr. Douglas,"Also released as ""Success can Be Yours"", Dr. Douglas has written a excellent book that will increase your self esteem, self confidence and energy. Dr. Douglas was a great author, but even better speaker. I have several of his cassette tapes as well."
5,First book for every Naturopath / Health pract.,"Lindlahr's books are not new, but then Natural Medicine isn't ""new"" either...The fundamental laws of Natural Medicine handed down even from Hypocrates's time and before have changed very little - only the tools have been refigned.These basic laws of Natural Medicine are thoroughly explored and explained in this the first volume of Lindlahr's texts.A word of warning to the critic by nature: Heed not the phrases outdated and better understood from today's perspective [e.g. White blood corpsules = nothing but flowting isles of debree] explore the basic understandings of health and disease explained beautifuly as they are in this volume instead!Enjoy & Good health!Chen Profesorsky, Naturopathy and Chinese Medicine"
4,Pretty good sound and pretty solid headphones,"I'm using the headphones with a high quality computer sound card. The headphones are a bit tight, but that is good, since they don't fall off when I look down!Comfortable enough to wear for hours and the sound quality is very good (although not superb, but for that you might have to spend $100s more).I am very happy with Sennheiser headphones and this is just another in a line of successes."
4,Very nice for the price,Overall very balanced and smooth. Deep realistic bass - cleaner than some more expensive phones I've had.Very comfortable for extended use. The headband does make a bit of creaking noise until you get it adjusted properly. Otherwise no complaints.
4,a trusted brand....,"Sennheiser is my goto brand for casual headphone listening. I prefer the open-air cups so I can still hear what's going around my office and still listen to music at the same time. No need to yell, ""uh, what did you say?"""
3,"Pretty Good, But not the Best","I tried them for a week:Cons: too tight on my head, the sound escaped too much, I could still hear people talking around mePros: I loved that it had a holder and that the cable can be detached from the headset itself.I ended up trading them in for the Sennheiser HD-280 Professional. So far I have found any cons with those. They are great."
3,Good Sound - Short Lifespan,"Bought these headphones in May 2006 as gift to be used for PC gaming by retired father, On Sept 2006 the Headphones stopped working - Left channel is gone. Read review in Amazon about more expensive pair (555) having same problem. Currently contacting manufacturer for options.It's incredible that an expensive product such as this would have such a short lifespan. I've had cheap Sony headphones last for years even tough they had been used and abused outdoors."
1,"Too easily overdriven, not enough bass","The first time I used these headphones I overdrove them, trying to get a satisfying amount of bass out of them. I overdrove them with a yamaha 50 watt/channel reciever via the headphone jack - with minor clipping only, no major distortion. They now crackle louder than my popcorn maker (the microwave oven) even when driven with my computer soundcard. They are great if you love the ""treble control"" at or near max. I know I should have purchased a studio monitor set of 'phones now. The SPL of these 'phones is great if you are driving them with a mp3/portable CD they may be fine. My 1981 set of Koss headphones ($24.95 at the time)are far superior. I have yet to obtain warranty coverage - and would advise anyone thinking of buying these that enjoy ANY music with a decent amount of bass, including classical music with demanding passages, avoid these headphones. 0 stars in my book."
3,You can do better with this price,"I have an old pair of Sony MDR-V6 which has a new model number now as MDR-V600 (being sold on Amazon for $71.94). I recently bought a pair of Sennheiser HD485 which cost $79.99 on Amazon. When I played the same music and listened from these two pairs to compare, wow! what a surprise. The 15 years old Sony sounds much, much better than HD485. The sound from the Sony is much brighter, much clearer, and you can hear much broader range of frequencies and volume. The difference is so big that I was propelled to write this review. In addition to better sound quality, Sony MDR-V600 is also lighter and more comfortable to wear. Save eight dollars and buy the Sony MDR-V600. You will thank me for this."
2,Taken back to the store,"The music sounded distant, like there was something between my ear and the music, as if I was listening to music with my ear to a door. It was just too irritating."
3,An Acceptable Hearing if not an Especially Happy One,"My wife and I have followed Theo Bikel's career for many years, including his Carnegie Hall recitals and his brief non-singing appearance in the movie, My Fair Lady. We enjoy his renditions, but less so these years as in earlier times; the quality of his voice has suffered from his aging. Nevertheless, the selections on this disk provide us with acceptable recordings difficult to find."
1,Vastly disappointing,"I had heard mixed reviews about this author, mostly negative, but I don't like to pass judgment until I have read an author's work. Suffice to say, I could only force myself to read about twelve chapters (and I do mean force) before I couldn't take anymore. The characters were confusing and not at all interesting. Nor did the title live up to the book. There was nothing pleasurable about the story or the hero and heroine."
2,Not up to snuff,"I has looked forward to this book since reading the author's previous two books. I knew she was revisiting with characters introduced in the previous novels. However, I was very disappointed in this book.The story was never on the same level as the first two. The medical premise of the story was weak and a bit contrived, especially the ""Cure"" and the life and death struggle at the end. The humor was weak and uneven. Overall not the quality I had anticipated."
5,DELIGHTFUL!,"Am definitely keeping this book & will read it again. Was laughing out loud (LOL) at the first ""tea"" and the events that took place. Excellent dialog, very subtle, dry humor at times along with slapstick comedy. Very sexy romances & the people are truly endearing. Actually was quite a page turner for me, started it at night & stayed up for hours reading it! What a treasure of a book!"
3,Entertaining...,Catches your attention but it never goes beyond a pleasant diversionary read.I have enjoyed much better from this author.
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I really liked this book. I thought that Quill was sexy and remote but still sensual with a good sense of humor. Gabby could slip into some silliness, case in point her ability to fall inlove with anyone, but overall was a likeable heroine.The two best things in the book were the fun use of Shakespeare (I pine, I burn, I perish), and Gabbys voluptuous figure. I also appreciated that she was not the most graceful creature on the planet.Sexy and fun"
4,4 1/2 stars.....Truly Enchanting!!,"This book is better than the other two Pleasure Series (Potent and Midnight Pleasures)....both characters are likable, truly enchanting. The only complaint I had was that since it is the last series, Ms. James should've at least revisited the characters from the other two novels. There were few parts from Sophie and Patrick but none from Charlottle and Alex. Other than that, it is a very enjoyable read."
5,A CD Single that is worth getting,This is for any serious Lifehouse fan - the CD single 'You And Me' is included as well as two songs that didn't make it on the new Lifehouse album (which should have in my humble opinion). All in all this is a true gem that stands out. I normally don't purchase CD albums but came across this mini CD in a album store and decided to get it.'You And Me' as I have said in my other Lifehouse reviews is one of the best songs next to 'Simon' and 'Storm' as well as 'Everything'. But tracks 2 and 3 come very close to being great. Track 2 is 'Butterfly' which Jason Wade excells. He has such a melodious and gifted voice. But the last track 'Ordinary Pain' is a great song - wow the lyrics are beautiful and the beat is just perfect. Lifehouse fans will be happy with this gem.Lifehouse is a great band that continues to show that they will be around for many years to come.
4,Barrueco's interpretation of these classics is refreshing.,"I am, as always, impressed by Manuel Barrueco's careful and conscientious approach to transcription and performance. Many of the aspects of Albeniz's piano originals are often abandoned or ignored in guitar transcription (presumably because of the level of difficulty in executing certain passages), but Barrueco succeeds in staying true to the spirit of the piano works in these recordings. I am only sorry that the recording is so quiet."
5,Esta increible,"Wow fue todo lo que pude decir cuando lo escuche por primera vez.Kabah es un extraordinario grupo es maravillosa la musica que hacen, las letras que escriben ellos mismos, el ritmo esta increible. Me encanto esto de las fantacias y las de amor estan buenisimas. Las canciones que mas les recomiendo son: La calle de las sirenas, Amor por amor, Vivir, Siempre hay una solucion, Vive, Sinti yo no, Juntos, Fuego de gloria, Estare, Amor paz y entendimiento, Tu risa genial y Amor de estudiante (Oops creo que son todas las del C.D.)pero es que todas estan buenisimas. Se los recomiendo esta padrisimo."
5,GREAT!!!! Music,"This is one of the BEST!!! cd's, Great songs and the music rithm is just AWESOME!!!!"
4,muy buen trabajo musical,"El grupo tiene una claidad de voces estupenda. La alternacion de canciones entre baladas y movidadhace que el disco se deje escuchar completo...Muy buena seleccion de temas, donde se le canta a todo tipo de situaciones que pasa la juventud en los años '90."
2,"Men, Women, and Pianos",Very dry. Textbook like. I find the information interesting but the book is hard to read.
3,Jim Backus and Parkinson's Disease,"This was a sweet, caring, tale of how his wife cared for him but did not go in to what Parkinson's really does to the patient AND to the caregiver. This was sugarcoated. Hopefully someone will write a book and describe how hard it is in the end stages of Parkinsons to help those caring for this patient."
2,Heart warming but not realistic.,I thought Care for the Caretaker was more about care for the patient. I was hoping to read more about her frustrations and fears and how she handled them. As a young partner of a young Parkinson's patient I also found the book unrealistic. I cannot stay home and read to my partner or do exercises with him. What Henny was able to do for Jim is very touching and wonderful. I only wish we all had those options.
4,Painfully honest about a super cool man yet a horrible husband,"I have always been a fan of Steve Mcqueen ever since I can remember. I always had a certain image of my idols and unfourtunately once you read about them and how they were as parents and partners or as a human being then it shatters that image not that I only like bad boys. I am glad I read this book because it just shows you bad is cool and to be honest its probably more interesting reading about what they did, in Steve Mcqueen's case sleeping with whomever came to him while married telling his wife that he only loves her and just F**** the others, how understanding of her to stay with him as long as she did.She writes very honestly and I enjoyed the book alot, I had heard things about this cool man but to read it first hand from his first wife and certain details it was a surprize."
3,More about Ms Adamas,"Not bad, but if you look at the title you.ll see... this is NOT a book about Steve McQueen's life."
2,"Hollow Sound, not enough bass","I ordered the HD215 for DJing on a vinyl mixing console but was disappointed with the lack of bass response and overall bulkiness, though I was willing to let the latter pass for a good pair of DJ headphones. Am a beginner trying to master the fundamentals of beatmatching and need my beat ala bass...Am going for something else."
5,Excellent Value and Great in a Technical Environment,"My use is atypical of the average reviewer, as I am using these Sennheiser SD 215s in a technical environment listening to very weak radio signals through custom & specialized equipment.Once ""burnt in"" the HD 215s have proven very useful in this application. The audio out I'm listening to has multi-stage filtering, Digital Sound Processing (DSP), Noise Blocking (NB), Notch Filtering, and a 8-band custom equalizer with sound gate.When I use the HD 215s with a conventional audio source their value stands. They are priced very modestly yet deliver sound reproduction usually associated with headphones costing 2-4 times as much.Useful & a keeper."
5,Quallity to Price Ratio Unbeatable,"What can I say, Sennheiser quality at a cheap cheap price. You cant go wrong with this purchase. Crisp highs, deep lows. Turning the volume up doesn't distort the sound, and actually feels like you are turning up the experience and not the decibels. If you look at Sennheirser's website you will see you are getting this model for a steal. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for audiophile quality for a flea market price."
4,Great Deal,"Great Product , The sound is great , you dont hear ambiant sounds and it comes with a leather bag and a adaptator. You can flip one hear so you can hear music on your speaker while listening to the next song , it's really useful for mixing. The only thing is that the bass are a bit weak but well for 100 buck you can hardly get something better! Shipping was really fast ... By the way those are really big so don't except to wear them on the street unless you want everyone to laugh at you. The wire is really long i think i could put my mp3 player in my shoes and still use the headphones"
1,Early Father's Day Gift gone bust,"I am not an audiophile by any means, and was searching for higher end headphones for my husband who is. I owned a pair of Koss Porta Pro headphones a few years ago and was thrilled with the sound quality (I mention this because it is the only thing I can compare them to) I put the Sennheiser cans on after seeing my husband's less than thrilled reaction and was shocked by the poor, poor, poor sound quality. Not sure whether or not they might be busted, but for the price tag there is no doubt they are being returned ASAP.Baffled by the more positive responses here, and I wish my review could be more technical, but there it is. Ladies be warned, this may not get the result you want on Father's Day. As for my husband at least he was too excited and opened his gift early."
1,Use them for what they are designed for: DJ,"There are DJ headphones, I got them to listen to my music with quality. Don't buy these if you are looking for a quality headphone."
3,A review by kayters,"Sally Jones is a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Sunny Flat, a small town in New South Wales, Australia. She teaches a class of 12 students, ranging in age from kindergarten to around the 10th grade level. One day in May, her classroom is invaded by four men wearing character masks who kidnap her and her students and intend to hold them for ransom. Their plans are thrown into confusion when Sally and her students take their fate into their own hands.First published in 1980 and also Gabrielle Lord's first novel, this book reads like a true crime novel. I found myself reading ahead to make sure of what was going to happen next and prevent too much suspense from building up (I can't take it!). I enjoyed this novel a bit, but I don't know if I will be reading more by Ms. Lord as I am not a huge fan of crime novels."
3,Lord of the flies returns,"This was a highly suspenseful novel - I found myself reading almost breathlessly to find out what was going to happen. The characters were engaging if not fully developed. I found the plot improbable in terms of the motivations of the kidnappers.As the title of the review suggests, I saw some parallels with William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies in terms of the brutality of the ending and the capacity for cruelty it demonstrated. There was, however, a huge difference in the complexity of the characters and the writing style."
5,The magic of Cortot's Chopin recordings.,"Alfred Cortot's reputation as one of the greatest piano players remains, fifty years after his death, and despite the ignominy he incurred from his association with the Vichy Government in World War II. These recordings, while showing the limitations of both the technology available at the time (from as early as 1920) and their age, are nevertheless wondrous, top-class, inspired and precious. Even the wrong and missed notes, a result of the limitations on the recording times and other factors, do not detract a bit from the quality of these recordings. Alfred Cortot's recordings of Chopin are truly in a praiseworthy class of their own."
3,Be prepared for lesser quality recording,"I purchased this CD set on the advice of other reviewers because I wanted a collection of Chopin works and it seemed that Cortot was one of the best pianists who performed Chopin's works.I cannot write about his musicianship compared with other artists--please read the other reviews. But I will say that if you're planning to purchase this set, be prepared that the quality of the recording is really not that good. I did not heed the warnings of the other reviewers. It sounds like Cortot is performing in the middle of a waterfall.Perhaps this recording will grow on me, but I'm going to look elsewhere for a set of Chopin works that I would listen to on a regular basis.Thanks for reading."
1,Waste of Time,Very poorly written. Comments were too general. Offered little insight regarding reasons for the success of the managers. Best part of the book was the compilation of track records for each of the managers.
3,Useful background detracted by gross errors,"Contains useful background information and insights on managers, and the industry though it is of limited use regarding the strategies those managers use. Two really glaring errors (page 48 & 49 on incentive fees, and Page 65 on correlations - perhaps a misquote or a quote out of context) cast doubt on the reliability of other statements in the book for me. Consequently I recommend reading it, but with more than the usual level of skepticism."
1,Waste of Time,"If you are familiar with Infovest21, a hedge fund news service that's really just a lot of fluff articles about old friends of Peltz, then you are familiar with Lois Peltz's writing style. Basically, she talks a lot about personalities, very little about the news and almost nothing practical concerning strategies or markets. Her writing style is boring and usually outsourced to employees and there's nothing in it that you can't find in a thousand other news services.This book might have some of the same ""virtues"" were it not also hopelessly out of date. Most of these ""superstars"" are out of the investment business and a couple of them are in jail for ponzi schemes. THat might provide a little ironic shaudenfreud but it really doesn't. The writing style is so hideous that you really can't read it for very long without wanting to throw it in a fire somewhere.Don't waste your time on this book or the news service by this woman. Just buy something intelligent instead."
4,Insightful!,"Lois Peltz has stolen the keys to Wall Street's inner sanctum and is waving you over to take a peek inside. Her insights on the hedge fund money machine - how it works, who runs it and how - should enthrall insiders and outsiders alike. She begins with the grand old gentlemen of the game, the likes of Julian H. Robertson Jr., Michael Steinhardt and George Soros, and tells how Soros speculated his way to a $2 billion profit - in one day! She shows how the game is played, and gives an insider's perspective on the methods of the new superstar managers. The in-depth profiles include: Lee Ainslie, Leon Cooperman, Ken Griffin, John Henry, Mark Kingdon, Bruce Kovner, Daniel Och, Raj Rajartnam, Paul Singer and Brian Stark. These managers will build the vast fortunes of the future - while also amassing their own. We [...] encourage investors, Wall Street players and interested spectators to hedge their bets, and buy this book."
5,A must for serious singers / perfomers,"This is a very good book. The area of the mental side of singing and performing is really paid too little attention to. There are so many books about singing technique etc. At last a good book on this subject! After having read only a few pages, it helped me already. The book is giving me very helpfull practical tips about selfconfidence on stage etc. The only thing is, that the English which is being used, is not so easy to read as in most American literature (I'm from Holland). But the positive thing about that is that I am increasing my English vocabulary..."
4,It's all in your head,"I have sung for most of my life, but I always had trouble with stage fright. I can get through the performance ok, but the song is never as good as when I was practicing. When I get nervous, my stomach tightens and then I don't have enough air to get the power I want. I read through this whole book, and I am going to incorporate the principles into my preparation. It is all a head game, I am understanding. The author gets you to examine your thought patterns and self talk. Also, the book has you list the things you do well so you have those in your arsenal for performing. It is going to take time, but if I'm consistent, the results will pay off.The book is written from the perspective of classical or opera singers and theatre performers, so there is some lingo you might not recognize if you are not from that genre. Yet the principles are still applicable regardless of the style of music you sing."
2,Not what I expected,"This thing looked good but there are problems. I didn't open it for over 3 weeks after receiving it. I wish I had because I would have returned it. The feed tube is very small so you have to cut things up that will fit. The blade fits into the top and not the bottom, you can't remove the plastic guard which makes it very difficult to clean. Since it can't be put in water, the top, you will have a really hard time getting food that is stuck in the grooves out. I wish I had gotten a regular food processor instead. I wouldn't recommend this item."
2,Low Quality,"This pan is much thinner than I expected. The glass cover has no top knob, so it is difficult to remove without getting a steam burn. Cover can't be used while using the no boil over lid, so much steam and heat is lost. This is just a poorly designed and poor quality pan."
3,anybody have this used yet or ever??,is there any chance this is gonna be available used or something??i just want to get it to have in my bookshelf..nice little novelty piece..ive seen in stock on porn sites for under 3 bux but i dont want to order anything thru them cause of all the junk mail you'll get afterwords...funny book... 3 stars...
2,"Rodrigo and Batiz deserve better than this,","As a long-time fan of Joaquin Rodrigo and a more recent fan of Enrique Batiz I eagerly looked forward to getting acquainted with some of Rodrigo's rarely heard pieces. Unfortunately thoses pieces will remain rarely heard due to the poor production quality of the CD. The sound was muddy and indistinct. Most of the tracks sound as if the microphone was under the stage. I had to strain to hear the guitar, harp, and flute soloists."
2,Quality has gone down,"When I had my baby 3 years ago I wanted really good quality products, and after research I picked California Baby products. Their diaper cream is wonderful and I loved most their products.The bubble bath was great, so much that I did not mind ordering it shipped to Canada and paying all the duty to have it shipped from the states.My most recent order was a real disappointment though. The bubble baths have been watered down. They run like water. They used to be very thick and last a long time. It is almost impossible to make bubbles now it is so thin.We liked a lot of the scents. The cold & flu was particularly helpful when my daughter was stuffed up. Unfortunately this last batch (I ordered a bottle of just about all the scents) had also changed in that you could barely smell the scent anymore.HOpefully they go back to their original quality."
2,"Disappointing, I fear","I was really disappointed in this book, having read some of the reviews here before I ordered it. I thought the characters - who had an unlimited supply of money - I wish I did - were flat, one dimensional, and never really came alive. The author did attempt to portray two men who really loved each other, I just wish he had been more successful in reaching his goal."
2,Poorly written page turner,"Although this book had its moments, I was perplexed by the seeming lack of proofreading or editing. The characters, with the exception of the wife and father in law, were one dimensional. The plot was riddled with historical inaccuracies and the text was rife with misspelled words. It is sad to see what passes for gay literature these days. Save your money. This is one piece of pulpy fiction without much in the way of redeeming value. The sex scenes are not even gratifying. If Mr. Benbow can pass this off as a novel and make a living in the process, there is hope for hack writers everywhere."
5,Don't overlook this gem,"A beautifully written and absolutely fun book to read over a weekend. The characters are likable and the sex is steamy. The pace is fast enough that you are never bored with the events unfolding throughout the story. I will admit that until this story, I had never read any book in the gay genre. I bought the book solely on the cover with only a quick scan of the blurb. Imagine my surprise to find that instead of male and female leads, there are instead two very intriguing men. To me, love is love regardless of gender, so I continued to read and was immediately drawn into the universe painted out in prose. The point of reading is to be entertained and I certainly was. I did not put it down until I reached the last page. Since I bought it years ago, I have repeatedly gone back to this story as a personal favorite in this genre. If you're looking for a drama, sex, and fun, this is the story for you."
4,Be True to Yourself,"This is a fun, fast-paced love story of Cameron and Blake. They fall in love quick and hard and must make adjustments to with each other. Cameron is married to a wealthy socialite Suzette. But their's a marriage of convenience. Both are unhappy but keep up the pretense until Blake rocks Cameron's world. So much so that Cameron is ready to accept Blake at any cost.Nothing is predictable about this story, meaning nothing is obvious. You expect the standard reaction and the author does an 180. It was good to see that the focus or angst of this story is not ""bashing"" (with the exception of Suzette's father. But even his motives are clouded by the loss he's experienced), but good ole fashion revenge and jealousy. Cameron and Blake commit to each other and ride out the turmoil unleashed by their love.The ending rings true to the lovers as well. Very good story."
4,No cheap substitute,"Of all the recordings of the Nutcracker that I've heard, this is my favorite (and not just because its from a movie that featured my home town troupe - the PNB). Everything is perfect tempo wise - from the overture to the cute little opera excerpt at the end. No dragging waltzes to tick me off. The loud cannons during the fighting scenes can get annoying after awhile - but the way Mackerras delivers this classic makes up for this and for a movie that sports a lot of elbow and ankle shots. The Sendak cover is great too!"
3,"The music is great, but . . .","I was using this to teach 5-6 year old children about the Nutcracker. For some reason, the volume of this CD was soft and I couldn't get it to be loud enough on my iTouch speakers. I actually bought a new speaker, thinking it was a problem with my speakers, but it was the same with the new speakers."
4,I Have Decided,"This is the first Amy Grant album I've ever listened to. It's not her best but there's however five classic songs and five other great songs too. ""In a Little While"", at first, is a peaceful song. Quite an unusual for an opener but it's a great song, and very very touching. ""I Have Decided"" has much more power, and great lyrics too. ""I Love a Lonely Day"" is a peaceful song which makes I listen to with a smile because I know that when there's me and God there's peaceful day and I can trust Him although I may have sometimes hard. ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"" is Amy's most powerful songs. ""El-shaddai"" is a peaceful but the best song in the album! Other five songs are great too. ""Fat Baby"" has strange lyrics and a strange melody but I eventually started to like it.Stars: El-Shaddai, Sing Your Praise to the Lord, I Have Decided"
5,The album that shaped Christian music in the 80s,"I live in Colorado, not far from where Amy recorded this album at a place called Caribou Ranch in the mountains west of Boulder. This was THE one for me back in 1982... the album that introduced me to Christian music, and literally changed my life. I remember sitting with my friends, listening to ""Raining on the Inside"" and ""Fat Baby"" (everyone's favorite), and learning to play the piano introduction to ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord"". Of course, anyone naming the top five most important and influential songs in contemporary Christian music would almost surely include ""El Shaddai"" on that list. This album is a must for ANY Amy Grant fan, for, although this was her fifth (I think) album -- she started at 16 -- it was the first in which she truly revealed herself to be an artist of sincerity, and as it turns out, of long-lasting appeal."
5,Heart-wrenching and thought-provoking...a masterpiece!,"The first song, ""In a Little While,"" immediately offers hope and reassurance, suggesting that ""Age to Age"" will behold more pearls of wisdom...and it does. From the determination of ""I Have Decided,"" the optimism of ""I Love a Lonely Day,"" the conviction of ""Don't Run Away"" and the longing in the finale, ""Arms of Love,"" (my personal favorite) Amy Grant reveals herself as someone made in the image of God that is struggling along life's path (just like each and every one of us). I recommend this album to anyone who wants to be drawn closer to the Lord or merely wants to release what is so often held inside. Whether the goal is to worship (""Sing Your Praise to the Lord,"" ""El Shaddai""), laugh (""Fat Baby""), or to relate (""Raining on the Inside,"" ""Got to Let it Go"") ""Age to Age"" humbly delivers wisdom and a higher perspective from a 20-21 year old woman (at the time) that was dealing with life's inevitable trials and temptations."
1,SOME EXAMPLE SHE IS,The music may have been ok back in the 80s.. but we have seen the true Amy in the past decade. Some example of Christianity. I dont think so. Listen at your own risk.
5,Age to Age,"This is one of favorite CD's of all time. I first bought ""Age to Age"" when it came out in a cassette tape and loved it then as well. Of course, I couldn't help but buy the CD as well. I have many of Amy Grant's CD's, but this is still my favorite. As a Christian, these songs are very meaningful for me and evoke many spiritual feelings. I highly recommend this CD for anyone."
5,Great Background Music,"Great background music for our trip to Italy, who better then Mantovani to represent a certain era with it's soothing classic music"
1,Eh,"I read on one of the hair forums that this was supposed to relax your curl pattern and make your hair less kinky, but after 2 months of taking one capsule per day, I saw no difference."
5,An Eye for an Eye,J. D. Robb does it again! This is the sixth in the Eve Dallas and Roarke series and is even better than the previous books. You really get into Roarke's past and what makes him tick. The relationship between Eve and Roarke is stronger and their love scenes are hotter and fresher than ever. This puts to rest the long held theory in the romance genre that once the hero and heroin get together they are boring. Eve and Roarke are anything but!Ree-Views
3,OK for contrived melodrama,"This book reminds me of why I seldom watch any TV crime series for more than one season. It seems that it only takes a few episodes to deal with realistic scenarios, and we are left with ridiculous dust-ups involving the series regulars. I know that Nora Roberts is very popular, but there is not much here except for the story. The characters would seem one-dimensional in a comic book. In a work of fiction, they are triter than trite. The plot is certainly fast-moving, but it is truly hard to believe that there are people out there who will not figure out whodunit pretty early. If you are already a fan of the series, then by all means add this notch to your gunstock, but if you are new to it, try one of the earlier works first."
5,J.D.Robb a.k.a. Nora Roberts Does It Again With Style!,"Vengeance in Death as well as the rest as the ""Death"" series is rated the highest with me because the author takes you into the lives and emotions of the main two characters of Eve and Roarke. Also, the characters of the fellow cast is slowly evoving with each new book. I had a friend read my copy who could not get past the use of futuristic language/tech terms. I didn't see the problem with the idea of licensed companions, etc. The book is not about the future itself, but the lives of those living in it. If you're looking for a good, suspenceful book that keeps you guessing as to the bad guy with the addition of an evolving love story, then this book is for you!"
5,book,everything came as expected in good shape and on time..thanks for your good service for these xmas gifts thanks again
3,Vengeance in Death,While I like the story lines in all of these books because they are suspenseful...I dislike the long description of sexual activity.
4,Nice continuation,I really liked this bood. It was another nice one in the series. I especially liked the foray into Roarke's past.
5,Believable picture of the middle of the next century,"As with all the 'In death' series an enjoyable read. But there is one matter, which makes J D Robb's picture of the future rather confusing. It is a petty point but one which nags. What are the units used? Sometimes they are metres and centimetres, sometimes feet and inches. Only in temperature is there consistency, all in Fahrenheit, though surely by the middle of the next century, when there is some form of world government in place the move to metric measurements would have been complete. Then what is the currency? Sometimes dollars, sometimes that classic SF standby credits. Minor points but they jar when reading. Otherwise a great read, and a believable continuing love affair between Eve and Rorke"
4,Good In Death book,"What can I really say beyond that this fits into an ""In Death"" fan's expectations. It's enjoyable as it really expands on Summerset's character, and you learn a bit more of Roarke's past, but other than that it is pretty much a run of the mill In Death book. It's nothing truly special, but it's an enjoyable weekend read - the mystery itself isn't overly complicated, and you know the motive, if not the exact perpetrator, early on, so there isn't a huge amount of suspense. It's a good read though, I'd recommend to any fan of the series."
5,The most memorable Karate movie.,"This is quite possibly the movie that I have watched the most in my life. my friends and I always use quotes from it: What? Are you sick, man? Her brothers my SENSEI! Don't fight it it's bigger than the both of us. A martial arts fan must-have."
3,"Jason, Childhood Hero","I hadn't seen this movie in about 15-20 years, I bought it to relive childhood memories with my brothers. I see that we didn't recognize cheesy acting or 'border line-gay behavior' with the acting before..hehe I'm glad I bought it because I will be able to show my kids the kind of karate movies the were around when I was a kid. The movie was cool but the acting was terrible, I will not be watching it myself but I will put it on for my kids in the future."
5,OH YEAH!,"NO RETREAT! NO SURRENDER! I love this movie, practically grew up with this movie watching it all the time with my older brother. So i decided to get him this for christmas! Arrived before christmas time and he loved it! Great seller and great product! Thank you!"
5,So it is you the son is it not?,The best martial arts movie of all time! fantastic choreography and great fight scenes! not too good on dvd as all the music and bruce lees voice was changed i have no idea y! if you want this the vhs version is better what we need is a vhs version on blu ray with all the original music etc! we need a re mastered blu ray release of this movie!
2,No Retreat No Surrender,Sound is terrible on this movie and the sad thing is it wasn't for me it was for someone else that loves the movie and they were so happy to get it but I will have to find another one. Im a little gun shy to buy used again though.
3,as good as it can be,"by ordering this movie i was aware what are the risks or low points, like low quality and no subtitles option....but it has very personal value to me, so i was truly happy that this movie exists on DVD!"
2,Great on a computer but didn't work on a DVD Player,I received this and I tried playing on my PS3 i said that the format was not supported. I went and pulled out one of my old DVD players and it would not play the DVD. I was about to file a complaint to the vendor and then i thought i would try to play this on my computer. My computer played it flawlessly. So I don't know what the issue is but it only seems to work on a computer and not any DVD players.
1,No Retreat No Surrennder,I really would have liked this movie (No Retreat No Surrender)if I could have watched it however being that it was not a Region 1 made movie it was not viewable in the U.S. due to it coming from another Region (2)U.K.I wish I had known that before my purchasing it...as far as delivery and condition of the product supplier Paperbackshop.Co.UK they were great and fast at delivering and refunding.The item was in great conditon.
1,"No Retreat, No Surrender","I first reviewed the seller's ratings and found them good. In my inexperience, I didn't notice where he was mailing from. Even if I had known it was coming from overseas, I would not have known that DVD's are coded differently in different countries. One country DVD's may not be able to be played on another countries DVD player. That was my case. I got the DVD and it was labeled all over that it may not play in the US. I contacted the seller and all he did was give me references of how this situation worked. I have contacted others and there may be a fix, but I'm not even sure it is legal. But, it certainly would be a lot of trouble. There was never an offer to return the merchandise. I don't think Amazon should allow products to be sold here that cannot be used here."
3,Where the hell is the DVD???,"I like this movie even though it is cheezy, but back then I only watched martial arts movies to see the fighting. Part 2 had even better fighting. It deserves a DVD remasterd original format release at least."
3,DVD+R media FTW,For the price I was expecting something a little more than a blue bottom disc in a laser printed jacket.
4,Worth watching for Van Damme.,"This movie has some seriously amateurish acting :) The only notable scenes are the first and last fights both of which involve the evil Russian (that is, Van Damme). I think that the last fight in this movie is Van Damme's best fight on screen (with none of that ballet stuff thrown in). The few times I watched the movie, I simply fast forwarded to the climax fight."
5,"This movie is good, but it gets better","From the infamous line that I'll never forget-- ""You're good. I get better."" Cracks me up just thinking about it.Anyway, this flick brings back fond memories. I remember me and a buddy, Danny, who were taking karate classes at the time would always 'act' out scenes from the movie and I think our acting was right on par if not better, if you know what I mean. I especially love the sound effects. A definite must-own for any martial arts fanatic's library."
4,"""...no, no, no, bring it over here!""","No Retreat No Surrender is a classic 80's indie film that introduced the world to cheesy ""karate"" films inspired by The Karate Kid and Jean Claude Van Damme.The movie stars Kurt McKinney as a wimp named Jason whose dad gets beaten up by a Russian guy named Ivan, played by Van Damme. His family move to Seattle where he gets pushed around by a group of karate bullies. Just when he thinks he can never learn karate, Bruce Lee's ghost appears to him and turns him into a fighting machine. In the meantime, the Russian arrives to fight for a championship against the karate bullies...and the rest is history.No Retreat No Surrender is one of those movies that connects me to my past childhood years. I watched this movie so many times when I was younger that I felt persuaded to revisit it with a purchase and this review!RecommendedB+"
1,I guess for those enthusiest's that love this movie like I do...,I have a VHS to DVD copy I made long ago that looks exactly like what they did with this movie.Do not get your hopes up! (has bootleg written all over it)
3,Not bad,This movie is from my childhood so I only have it on VHS so who knows how much longer it will last. I wanted it on DVD but to my surprise there are a few scenes that have been deleted. It is not the full length movie. But someone who has seen it many times would not need those scenes. For someone who hasn't they are critical scenes explaining things.
4,So bad it's good. And it is still good today.,"Unfortunately, whoever has the rights to publish/distribute ths movie is a greedy lunatic. This great martial arts film, one that traded the thin line of ""so bad it's good"", has received absolutely no treatmnet at all to sound and image in this DVDF transfer. Image is grainy, unfocused, colorless, an abomination. No excuse for something like that.The movie itself stand well the teste of time, if you are willing to cut it some slack. It's fun, naive, lighhearted. IN enjyed it a lot before, and enjoyed it now. I just wished other company had the rights to it and did not such a lousy DVD job. A tragedy. This movie deserved better."
3,"No Retreat, No Surrender","Being a Region 2 item, I was not able to view the movie. I will have to find a video player that is multi-regional. It was a present for someone special. I cannot give it until I see it."
3,Second movie of JCVD.,"Not a great movie but that's good for see JCVD yesterday. When you see this movie, you understand JCVD is today a very best actor."
2,Overhyped,I was disappointed with this book. After reading all of the reviews it sounded as if it would be insightful and useful. I found it to be neither for the price that you pay for the book. Bookkeeping for Dummies was much more insightful then this book.
3,Hellooooo,"I bought this book to get insight on opening your own in home bookkeeping, there are many great points she gives in the book, but the only thing that I didnt like is the price, its overpriced.. but great book.."
4,"I found this book useful, informative and practical","I bought this book as part of my research into setting up my own financial services consultancy. I found the book informative and practical. Even though it is unlikely that I will include the provision of basic accounting / bookkeeping in my final business model, I would still recommend this book for those planning to offer these services."
3,Good but ....,"I got this book based on the other reviews. It contains a lot of good and useful information don't get me wrong. But for me, I felt it was overpriced at $89.95. A more reasonable price would have been like $24.95."
2,Helpful ?,"This book has a lot of basic pointers, but is very overpriced. If you are thinking of professional bookkeeping as a profession, hopefully you already know how to keep books! I was looking for more help with the business side of things, and this did not take into account the newer services offered by Quickbooks,(such as their excellent payroll services) therefore a lot of it is outdated. About 1/3 of the book was useful to me."
4,Cute Thank-you's,This book is a cute way of teaching your children to give thanks to God. It covers many things that we often overlook. I recommend this to anyone trying to teach their child Christian values.
1,Biological determinist.,"Depending on why you want this book will depend on its usefulness. If your writing an essay to show that men and women are different based on evolutionary approaches then this is your book. It might be worth pointing out I would consider it up there with claims that blacks have a lower I.Q than whites. Most of the studies cited and approaches used have all been questioned scientifically in the past, there is reasonable doubt for me at least that this book contains any truth and merely moulds societies present gender structure views in a way that is hard to disprove, something any first year Psych student will know is true of socio-biology and evolution theories."
2,Edgy? Only because it's dull,"I have a healthy appreciation for 'bad' movies and for sexploitation films, and it's very rare for me to watch one of these films and not like it. If you watch a film expecting it to be bad, and it meets those expectations, then it's less of a disappointment. This film is one of the few I've watched that was disappointing.The main character goes to a beach house alone for vacation. She meets the various neighbors and voyueristically watches them. Seems like a promising plot for sexploitation/soft core erotic film. the problem is this film throws in irrelevant subplots and not all of them get resolved. In the end, the film is more disappointing than entertaining."
4,A good collection,"A good collection of short stories by Lovecraft, building to a climax with The Dream-quest of Unknown Kadath. There are a few unfinished works at the end that feel tacked on, but one of his early short stories: The Beast in the Cave is one my personal favorites."
1,a tremendous bore,This volume is a pedantic and tremendous bore by a self-indulgent author. A total waste of time.
1,Pedantic Banter by a Former Reed Professor,"This attempt at a great American novel by a former humanities professor from Reed College strikes out. It is not great. It is not good. It is self-indulgent, illiterate and ae-entertaining. It is not a novel but a collection of reminiscences from an educated man who found his greatest happiness in the company of the unwashed and uneducated, whose experiences he tries to detail. A totally wasted effort. Don't waste either your money or time with this one."
5,Great salsa Cd!!!,"Great salsa music! 1 of my favorite singing artist, next to Frankie Ruiz. Love this guys voice, style & tempo! Yes i would recommend! Thanks!"
2,Only for fans,"A great premise, and even more promising cast. However, Salonga's acting is terribly disappointing. She's very theatrical, possibly from her then-recent Miss Saigon experience. Expect a pretty slow-pace film."
2,Cornering the consumer,"You know, this video for Afterglow really caught me by surprise in a good way. I immediately went out to fetch a copy of SWITCH and thankfully I was able to listen to it first. Of course, Afterglow IS NOT THE SAME TRACK ON CD AS IT IS IN THE VIDEO. So I did not end up buying the album. Kind of like how all these ""definitive"" best of collections that always seem to leave off at least 1 or 2 sadly neglected hits. (Jackson Browne double cd, for one)So I looked for the CD single of Afterglow. And it's friggin $12. More with s/h. Doesn't this seem rather steep for a CD SINGLE??? Sheesh.I'm a music fan in every sense but it's reasons like this that make downloading for free, seem fair and justified."
2,Great for Grannys.,This was a fall back gift for my GF. It wasn't very pretty in person. Great for any old lady on your gift list.
3,Slasher in da hood,"Man this is some fun modern black exploitation and I must say I have never seen anything like it. I like this movie for a lot of resions, great dialog, great cast and for real looking settings. I only wish we would have had the token white hottie so the bad black girls could have picked on her skinny butt till she got her turn at the slasher's blade. The folks who are picken on this film must not like slasher film's.I am telling you I have set threw way to many slasher flicks and this one is better then 50% of them any day of the week.This is not Menace 2 Society people. This is trash talken thugs and one dude trying to make it out of the ghetto, oh that does sound familiar ..any way good stuff, do not miss it."
4,CAN'T MISS,"THIS FILM IS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN ""SCREAM"" AND THE MOVIE ""BOYZ IN THA HOOD"". I THOUGHT THE PLOT WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE WAS REALLY BELIEVABLE. I ENJOYED THE WRITER-DIRECTOR OF THE FILM (TIMOTHY WAYNE FOLSOM) PREVIOUS FILM ""UNINVITED GUEST"" WHICH STARED MEKI PHIFER AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR ""CUTTHOAT ALLEY"". ALTHOUGH THE ACTORS WHO PROTRAYED THE CHARACTERS ""JACOBS"" AND ""BONES"" ARE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWNS, ALL THE ACTORS IN FILM HAD GREAT PERFORMANCE AND YOU WILL DEFINITELY SEE THEM ALL AGAIN!!! THE MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE YOU GUESSING TO THE VERY END AND YOU DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FINALE. THIS IS REALLY A CAN'T MISS MOVIE AND WHEN YOU RENT OR PURCHASE THE DVD YOU WILL AT THE VERY LEAST BE ENTERTAINED!!!"
2,Good cupcake information-easel format detracts from utility,"Saw an extract from this book in Mary Engelbreit's magazine - it looked good so I ordered the book from Amazon. Thought the information was good, recipes look good - both for the cakes and for the icings. HATE the easel format. It isn't a book, its a little flip-chart on a shakey easel with weird flaps and folds. Might be useful if you want to sit the book up on a counter and look at it while cooking but it really detracts from when you just want to sit and read it. It has a lot of text not associated with a specific recipe so you'd really want to just read it - the pages are head to head so you can't even read one page and then the next. Despite the appeal of the recipes, I probably would have passed had I realized how the ""book"" was set up."
4,"A little silly at times, but good intro","Well the other reviews say it, the author presents the basics of digital logic design (boolean algebra, K-maps, optimization, minterm/maxterm representation, etc.) in a humurous fashion. You learn digital logic design *AND* have fun, too!The added bonus is the included software. The book comes with Xilinx Student Edition 2.1i, which you can use to draw schematics and simulate them. So you can apply what you read in the book. More advanced users can use the Verilog/VHDL synthesis tools (no simulation, htough) to practice FPGA design (which is beyond the scope of this book.) The *latest* third-edition printings, as of September 2000, include Xilinx Student Edition Software 2.1i...Most places don't have them in, yet. And ordering online is no guarantee you'll get the latest shipments..."
2,"It could have been worse, but not much",As a computer science student I had no background in this material what so ever and I must say I passed the class and still know nothing of it. The book accelerates way to fast and the problems at the end of each chapter are nothing like the ones presented in the chapter. Just about every problem takes about an hour to do and many I only figured out how to do by checking solutions after the fact.
2,Not a good book for nonECE students >:(,"The first four to five chapters are ok. You actually get a chance to learn something useful, like binary arythmetic and switching algebra, as well as how to build some basic circuits (although I often had to search the web for the additional explanation). After that, however, the material becomes so complex and confusing, that after reading it I usually was like ""Uh, what did he just talk about?"" All in all, I think that the ECE class was a waste of time and I wander why we had to take it in the first place."
2,Buckle Up Bonehead!,"I hope you're an EE guy who needs some background on digital design, because if you're of a CS background, buckle up bonehead. This text is aimed at EE guys because it very heavy on the low-level and mathmatical aspects of digital design. I only read this book because I had a CS/EE class which was based around this text. I actually learned something though, but this was only because my instructor was an EE guy who could filter out the low-level stuff, so that it was only logic left(which actually makes sense to me). I didn't try the software, but most people are using Electronics Workbench anyway, thus making the included software a very nice frisbee. I should know; mine is sitting on the top of the business building right now. It would have been nice if Electronics Workbench was included because, if you want to buy EWB, you better have your tupe on because it's time TO PAY!"
5,You go Girl!!,"Loved Loved Loved it! Mrs. Dorothy can write! She NOW MY FAVORITE WRITER. I loved how the characters were so normal.I liked how the lead male was good looking and not some older ok looking male. I picked this up and could not stop. I was so into it, i even threw in an accent while i was reading!..lol...I will be re-reading this soon!great read!!"
4,Riveting,"A must see for lovers of ""Black Church Music"". I disappointed to see the video only lasted 25 minutes. Just when the praising got good, it was over (which resulted in the 4 star rating)."
5,"Concepts, code, and some math... its a keeper.","I am not through this book yet, and no it is not an openGL manual... nor did I notice it claimed to be. It is a useful, fun book for learning how to do grahpics programming...What parts I have done so far have made me feel pretty good about my purchase, I never get so stuck I can't code my way to some solution. In addition, the book leads you on to better ways to do things starting from simpler, brute force stuff.Then there's the bits of math review and exercises... useful but not overwhelming so far.For me the parts about self-affine curves and golden ratios were things I skipped or skimmed.... but they can be useful I am sure.Better than many out there."
4,Good Intro to Graphics programming,"An effective book to use if you already know your maths, have good foundations in C/C++ and some basic knowledge on OpenGL. I bought this book a year ago and enjoyed reading it because I felt that it was clear and organised. The examples are good and reinforce the knowledge encountered within this book."
1,Not opengl just graphics,"The title is very misleading, it says it uses opengl but there are hardly any examples in it. Also the source code is nonexistent on the website. You do not want to use this book to try and learn or teach opengl. If you just want to learn how computer graphics work, it is semihelpful, but if you want to learn opengl get either the reference manual or the programmer's guide (red or blue book)."
2,Freak man!!!,this book is absolutely not for amateur.not good either for actual professional.it teaches more math than actual opengl and 3d graphics!!!!!so if you just want to play around with opengl dont go for this book!!!!!
2,should have been better,"There are some kinds of errors in the book, such as print errors.For example, in the page with the photo of the author, ""amherst"" has been printed as ""a,herst"". When you read through the book, you will encounter such findings.Sometimes you cannot find the formal definitions of some terms,such as ""affine transformation"".It should have been better."
1,No Content in this Video,"I am very disappointed in ""Tony Gwynn's The Five Keys To Hitting - The King of Swing"". There is precious little instruction content on hitting in this video. What secrets Tony Gwynn knows about hitting and drills - he kept to himself. The video is 30 minutes long of which 10 minutes is devoted to introducing us to Special Guests and other unknowns who offer zero to the subject matter. Another 19 minutes is devoted to telling us what a great guy Tony Gwynn is, and how hard it is to travel all the time. A full one minute is devoted to actual hitting instruction, and there is no content provided that is not already know by any first year tee baller. The bloopers at the end of the production just demonstrate how Gwynn treated the making of this video as a joke. This video was a complete waste of time and not even worth a free viewing of the tape."
1,Not worth the price,Wasted alot of time talking about what he likes to do. Doesn't get into details of the swing or the concepts of the swing.
2,Stay Away From Name Players Who Teach Instruction,"Someone once told me if you are looking for an instructional sports video from a professional athlete, the bigger the name the worse the video.How true. I then purchased this video recommended to me by an unknown called ""The 59 Minute Baseball Practice"". What a difference. This video was excellent and well thought out. I used a number of the drills in the video and they are great!Tony Gwynn should stick to what he does best. HITTING!The video focuses on a lot of non sensical stuff. Like having a lot of other pros. It seems like he is just name dropping.The tips he gives are not very helpful and the quality is not great. Usually I try to come away with one concept with an instructional video and with this one I drew a blank. Too bad because I think these pros don't really know what they do they just are incredibly talented. Trust me on this. Save your money and if you are involved in Little League, buy ""The 59 Minute Baseball Practice""."
4,Adventure in another time,"Reading Maugham's colorful descriptions of his travels in a small volume with yellowed pages easily lulled me back eighty years into the time he wrote which is so different from how one would go to SE Asia nowadays. Taking a break from writing fiction, he filled his journal with interesting stories of people he met along the way. I especially marveled at the former monk's recollection of collecting food in his begging bowl and the man who had to marry in a hurry in order to get a job. The beauty of his writing shown through each page; for example: ""The coconut trees with their disheveled heads were like old men suddenly risen from sleep."" Written from his heart, the journal felt like a way of getting a look inside Maugham's soul."
4,excellent reading,"For those interested in WW II 0n a historical,or adventure story base this a good book"
3,Repeat material,"I was surprised that so much material from a previous collection ('Selected letters of Raymond Chandler', ed. McShane, 1981)is repeated in this book. Maybe I didn't do my homework, but I don't recall this fact being mentioned in promotions or reviews. When you're paying (as I did) [price] for a book, it's disappointing to keep coming across previously published letters. Chandler's writing is still great, but I'm sure he'd have something to say about this practice."
3,Sort-of a Documentary!,"I was a little disappointed in this DVD. It had the potential to be quite good, but ""missed"". I thought it was in English, but it is Cantonese/Mandarin with English S/T, not in itself bad if the documentary had been good. Mainly, it is various martial arts scenes from Jackie's Lo Wei film period (c. 1975-1978). The scenes are very good, all wide screen so you see everything. However, the Chinese commentators have tried to be ""clever"" and linked the scenes with a fake ""story"" on Jackie's training in various styles of kung fu. If you know the films the scenes are from (and I have seen them all) this type of treatment becomes very irritating. It could have been done so much better (ie. a REAL dissertation on Jackie's unique development of combination of various styles of martial arts and comedy). Not a bad DVD, if only for the opportunity to see some brilliant martial art action in wide screen, but not a must see for Jackie fans."
2,5 bucks at K-Mart,This is a Documentary about Chan's early films and his rise to stardom. It's not a re-name of one of his earlier films.
3,very good,"due to the time limit, could'nt focus properly, however what i can recall makes me wonder if the fishfinder on my boat (apelco 560) can do the same!!"
5,Wow!,"If you have regular 60 or 65 Watt bulbs in your vehicle I highly recommend upping the power to these 100 watters. They throw the light way farther than the standard bulbs and it's a touch whiter too. I had the blue tinted ""Xenon Quality"" ones in my truck and never liked them, these bulbs are so much better! No regrets for buying these especially for less than $6.00 each!"
1,"Bulbs are not ""Hella""","These bulbs came in Hella boxes but were not Hella bulbs. Returned them to Amazon, no problem."
5,Excelent,"Far brighter than 65watt oem, and far brighter than the stupid blue coated bulbs. I took a light meter and the factory brights were 95 ft/cd, the 100 watt blue coated bulbs were 120 ft/cd, and the Hella 100 watt bulbs measured 320 ft/cd (all measured at brightest point, at the same distance). I would recomend changing 1 bulb and then shining them on a white wall or garage door to appreciate the differance, before you change both bulbs."
1,doesn't play,It wont play at all it say not capable of playing so I cant watch it or return it so am stuck with a movie that didnt work
1,Dang! Smh,"It won't even play in standard dvd players, lucky I could watch it on the xbox, and the quality it straight tape quality....but it was a classic I was looking for so I guess that's worth one star"
4,Getting your children sober,"Very good information included in this. However, it is more geared toward children still under 21 living in your home. In other words, doesn't really apply to grown children living on their own."
1,I can't believe the other reviews here! Terrible writing.,"Make that a negative three stars. Between this book and these reviews I'm wondering if perhaps I have a brain tumor. This is the worst writing I've ever read, the most baffling editing, and who proof-read it?! I'm not nearly so outraged by the inconsistencies and improbabilities that suggest it may be partly fabricated. I quail less before the unlikely depiction of a whole culture devoid of intelligent adaptations to cruel conditions -- less than I recoil from the simple fact that this memoir was published and is acclaimed. The writing is clotted and nonsensical not magical or fascinating. ""...mostly I lazed like a lizard escaped from its prey."" Think about it! Jeees."
3,Beautifully written but with many flows concerning accuracy.,"It's a beautifully written book about the hacienda living in Venezuela. Being Venezuelan I was disapointed about many inacuracies that I found. 1) She says the Mayas Indians lived in the west part of Venezuela when the spaniards arrived. False. No Mayas in Venezuela. 2) The ""Gaita"" music she describes as coming from the plains (los llanos), has its origins in Zulia State. 3) The founder of the socialist party was Jose Vicente Rangel and not Rafael Rangel. 4) The head of the family, that she calls ""padron"", is the ""patron"" with a p. 5)Presidents are elected every five years, not every four years. And on and on. Is this bad editing? Probably so."
2,An ultimately disappointing book,"What could have been a truly wonderful book, by clearly a good writer, is written with a detachment that leaves one feeling cheated. Important details are utterly ignored, large chunks have been left out -- I was very let down. The setting, however, is rather wonderful, just that we never get to really know the people, so the story falls flat. Emotions are ignored, left out -- even the relationship of the protagonist with her baby. A shame, it really could have been a first class book."
2,Emotionally-distant author,"For a memoir, the author is very removed from the experiences she writes about. She conveys little if any emotion about what must have been a very lonely and often frightening existance (especially given her age) in a strange land with a mad and eventually abusive husband, a young child who was often extremely sick and with the responsibilites of running a hacienda. Although her writing is beautiful at times, the author never really connected with me."
3,culture clash,The Europeans is a classic tale of two worlds colliding. On one side we have the bohemian Europeans; on the other we have the puritan New Englanders. It is the conflict of language as well as culture which is evident throughout the book. I believe the sympthay lies with the New Englanders as after all their guests were vistors to New England. Although it was later acknwoldged that James did not intend the character of Getrude to be good; i nevertheless rejoiced in her rebelious nature but felt concerned she was being manipulated by her european suitor. A very good and more importantly short read.
5,The Europeans,"When I found out that ""The Europeans"", by Henry James, could offer more than just a wonderful film, I couldn't wait to order the unabridged ""The Europeans"" Audio-CD, read by Lloyd James, as well as the complete soundtrack CD ""The Europeans"", with composer Richard Robbins' arrangements.The film is a James Ivory's masterpiece with a New England autumn background, the Audio-CD matches the film wonderfully, where you can picture the film characters through Lloyd's interpretation, and the Soundtrack CD starts off with breathtaking Clara Schumann's ""Andante"" Opus-17."
3,Less brilliant than other James' works,"This is not one of my favourites (and it was not among the James' fovourites, either). Both characters and plot do not live up to the very high standard I got used to, reading HJ.I read this book soon after ""Washington square"", and while I was really shocked by how brilliant and powerful that novel is, this one has not had such a strong effect (not that it is bad, simply it is not too good)."
3,Satisfactory,"I believe that James has created another of his outstanding novels, this on in particular has sense of greed to it. It is filled with love and and selfishness something which show in most characters I give a 3 star rating."
2,first time disappointment,"I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes."
2,All's well that ends well,"This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...'It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love.There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century.This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert.It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.Only for Henry James fans."
3,bahar,"I never could find this simple water gear anywhere, so I bothered myself to pay I guess 7 or 8 dollars for shipping, however, the product made from very cheap material, the figure is just on the top one, so you need to keep the top one all the time, my son did not like the graphic design on it, he did not use it, too bad for me, waste my money."
3,not what I expected,"I bought this for my almost two year old. I guess she isn't ready for it yet, maybe next year. If I let go of her when she has it on, her body goes right onto her belly and her face is in the water. She doesn't get that she has to work to keep herself upright with it on. I will save this for next summer and hope we can use it then."
1,Not so pleased,"It should be stated in the description that this item has a 50 lb weight limit and it is considerably smaller than what I would have expected. The description says it is for small children. I think it would be appropriate to say toddler since the flotation device is only 6 1/2"" by 8 1/2"". It is really just kind of cheap looking foam material. I didn't think that it even looked safe but that is just my opinion."
5,excellent choice for any car!,"Installed on a mazda 3 and it sounds excellent. Car performs smooth and notice a little bit of difference in performance. Beware muffler is loud! , had to use a resonator. Overall great product."
3,Back Cover Intro,"This introduction was taken from the back cover of the book:Any doctor will agree that people are not flat. They are born round and stay that way their whole lives. But not Stanley Lambchop! He has been flat once before, after a bulletin board fell on him. When his brother made him round again by blowing him up with a hose, Stanley thought he was through with flatness forever.And then one ordinary morning, Stanley suddenly goes flat again, and this time, the hose won't work. Not even Dr. Dan's explanation can really help Stanley understand why so many unusual things keep happening to him. Still, there are things that a flat boy can do that a round person can't. And maybe this time, all it will take is one amazing event for everything to finally make sense."
4,"After a long wait, Mac Mall delivers",A great cd!! Track 2 and track 7-with J. Diggs-are bangin'! Looking forward to live shows....
5,The most underrated excells again.,"This gets 5 stars for the simple fact that if you turn people on to Mac Mall, they are forever in your debt.Thizziana Stoned does not disappoint. Clever guest vocals, grimy beats, and the ever sessalistic Mac Mall tearing every verse apart.The CD is a decent length, and there doesn't seem to be any cheap production even though it's coming out on a smaller imprint.Cop it now or look dumb and cop it later. Either way it's a must have."
4,It has some slaps,"I'd have to say this is his best work since Untouchable. It starts off slappin, for about 7 songs or so... tones down to 'ehhhh' for a few tracks... then picks back up for a great finish. Overall I was satisfied, but not amazed.Notable tracks:- girls jus wanna- here come- ratha have- shoo- perfect poison- throw up T's- it aint eazy bein meezy"
2,Not much for the money,"Ugh. Listening to this is a chore in every sense of the word: from the conducting to the performing, nothing goes quite right in this set. The fact that someone recorded this as a testament to......something......says......nothing. Oddly, I'm not entirely displeased with the purchase: after sampling some horrific examples from the set, I'm motivated to seek recordings if only to dispel the memory of Mr. Villa Lobos' worst moments. Buy at your own risk if you are looking forward to repeated listenings, but not the worst way to get an overview of some fine compositions that are relatively unknown."
4,If you want the BLUES,"If you want the blues, then buy this album. It is spectacular. The two live songs are a great added bonus to an already spectacular album."
2,This is NOT Dragon Gate Inn,"This film is listed under IMDB and Amazon as ""Dragon Gate Inn"". It is in fact a totally different film, and bears no relation to the classic 1966 film"
3,"Somewhat minor kung fu movie, but good","'Green Dragon Inn' has a well told story, very good acting, and slightly above average action. Yueh Hua plays a marshal who is sent to capture a murderer. The murderer's father doesn't want him to be taken to jail so he hires assassins to take out the marshal. One is Sze Ma-lung who is known as The Shaking Eagle in the UK for his oustanding fist forms, and of course because of his role in '18 Fatal Strikes'. So be sure to watch for the guy who is always looking to show off his iron fist. I could have used more action from The Shaking Ealge, but he is awesome when he does get to show off. Lo Lieh and Polly Shang Kwan also star.While the action is good, it can be a bit slow at times. There is some good hand to hand at the end and Kwan is very good in her limited action. The fighting was more grounded than a lot of movies that take place in the martial world, and I can't complain about that. 3.5/5Picture from World Video is full screened but watchable."
1,Computer help,"Word 2000 for Windows (Visual QuickStart Guide)Frankly, I found this a waste of money. It may help someone that knows nothing at all about computers, but don't count on it."
1,Open ended musings with no conclusions,"As you've probably noticed from the other reviews, J. Harvey does a good job raising questions about morality related management decisions, e.g. backstabbing or betraying a co-worker.My own enjoyment of the book suffered because there are no answers to the questions posed. Morality is not the sort of topic where one expects to the THE answer. However, I do require a speaker/writer to at least propose their answers, so I may compare and contrast them to my own views.I recommend this book if you prefer an open-ended discussion with no suggested or implied solutions.For new managers with their first inkling they might have a few misconceptions about what they've just gotten into, I recommend ""Becoming a Manger: How New Managers Master the Challenges of Leadership"" by Linda Hill."
4,Interesting ruminations on ramanagement,"The book centers on a key concept - we victimize ourselves. Work is a political place, but most of the time, we see problems coming. If someone stabs us in the back, usually we get a warning, but are complicit by not assertively contacting the person doing us in. This idea of defeating poor office behavior through open and honest discussion is developed in depth throughout the book.There are two downsides. First, this book perhaps has too much text for such a simple concept. Although this is good reading for a fan of Jerry Harvey (I am one!) the Abilene Paradox is a much more efficient (more ideas, less words) introduction to his material. Second, Jerry is perhaps oversimplifying the world. Office politics is best beaten by open book confrontation of problems, but life sometimes is more complex than that.That said, this is still a worthwhile read."
3,"Great Title...Sadly, I hoped for more...","Although the early part of the book was quite entertaining, interesting and thought provoking, the author eventually took the reader down a long, circuitous path that left not only me, but the two others on my team perplexed as to what on earth he might have been thinking.Sadly, the value of the learning was a huge disappointment to us and this book remains one of the only ones from my studies that I will be happy to see sold back to the bookstore.Sorry folks."
4,The views of a sage,"I don't know what posessed me to pick up this book at the library. I'm not an avid reader and I was doing research on an unrelated topic. I suppose the title just grabbed me and I needed a break from my regular study. When I started reading this book, however, I didn't want to put it down. At age 39, I'm only just beginning to appreciate the wisdom 50+ years develops in some people. So when I started reading this very easy-to-read book, filled with ""smart"" humor and just the right amount of antedotal support, I was just soaking in everything I could. Maybe you have to be older to appreciate this book...but wouldn't it be great if you were smart enough to learn from it much younger...."
1,Item didn't arrive - Don't order this,After waiting 2 months of the delivery I still have nothing. There seems to be no way to contact Amazon about this. Very poor service. I recommend NOT ordering from them. I'll have to arrange a charge back on the CC
3,Insight into the life of a star,"I found this book to be quite an in-depth view into the life of Katherine Hepburn, an elusive star. It offers a back-stage view of the life of an icon and the struggles and triumphs that are associated with that responsibility. I would definitly recommend this book to those interested in the genre."
4,"The themes of ""Virtue"" resonate today.","Nearly two decades after it was published, Will's second collection of columns bears reading today. The themes Will addresses in the columns -- the role of government, the coarsening of culture, etc. -- continue to resonate. This is an excellent resource for anyone trying to get a feel for American culture from 1977-81. I highly recommend this book."
1,Messiaen and I genuflect in different ways,"I stumbled across a short biography of Messiaen in a literary journal. A devout Catholic, Messiaen was purportedly commited to preservation of medieval sacred music -- which led me to pick up this album -- and yet all I find is that composed some of the most minimalistic modern 'music' that I've ever heard. According to musical theorists, there is a beauty in the mathematical algorithms that he exercises on his keyboard, but in no way does that beauty extend into a melodic piece. This is not sacred gregorianesque music, this is not heavenly plainsong, this is not glorious baroque. If Messiaen truly did intend this to be sacred music, all I can say is that he and I genuflect in different ways."
5,PLEASE HELP ME!,"I'M SERIOUSLY LOOKING FOR A UNKNOWN TITLTED SONG BY AMY GRANT. I WAS LISTENING TO THE SONG ALL THE WAY TO NY CITY WHILE I WAS MOVING IN ON X'MAS DAY OF 1995. IT STARTS LIKE ""I FOUND A SPRING TIME, IS THE VERY MERRY MORNING..."" SOME LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW THE TITLE OF THIS SONG? PLEASE WRITE ME BACK! YOU WOULD BE REALLY APPRECIATED ! THANX."
5,The Best of Amy Grant,This is the best collection of songs Amy Grant has ever done!I absolutely LOVED all the songs on the CD and I am only 14 VERY easy to understand and comprehend.And for the people who say this is stupid they must not have listened to it with ears!Its wonderful Please if you are looking for great praise music this is the CD for you!I reccommend it for everyone!
5,it is the best and so ain't amy grant,i liked amy grant for a while and i jus tlike to say that this compellationkills all others.
3,Just your basic Amy Grant CD,"This compilation CD is just your basic Amy Grant collection....like most of Amy's CCM offerings, this one is sometimes inspirational (""El Shaddai,"" ""Sing Your Praise to the Lord""), sometimes incomprehensible (""Stay for Awhile,"" ""Find a Way""), and sometimes cutesy (""Father's Eyes""). On the whole it will be enjoyed only by those who are died-in-the-wool Amy Grant fans. For the rest of us, there are some memorable songs here that make it worth having--you just have to keep a finger close to the buttons on the CD player so you can skip the mediocre stuff to get to the good ones. (By the way, my personal opinion is that Amy would be a lot more pleasant to listen to if she didn't insist on pronouncing the words she sings so goofily! Some of the songs on this album are almost comical because of her bizarre pronunciations--""Where Do You Hide Your Heart"" is TERRIBLE in this regard!)"
2,Missing a few hits but still a good album,I have been a Amy Grant Fan ever since I saw her singing baby baby on a Disney special. I bought the Collection because I had liked Sing your Praise to the Lord but was disappointed that many of her other gospel hits were not in it. Where's Old Man's Rubble? What about Wise Up from Unguarded and Faith Walkin' People from My Father's eyes and what about The Next Time I fall the duet with former Chicago lead singer Peter Cetera. Aside from the two new cuts featured on this album this is a good album. But if you want more Amy Grant songs get her new greatest hits album.
2,It's Okay,"I'm 14 and got this CD at a youth group gift exchange. The only christian music that i like is Out of Eden and The W's.It's not that I don't like Amy Grant, because I met her and she's nice and she has a great voice, but her songs are a little stupid. No offense."
4,"Only the best, forget the rest.","While I am no big admirer of ""Best of"" collections, every album has a buried treasure or two that just did not click with the mass audience. But for those who want to save space and/or money, then this collection is the one to have. It has all the career highlights of the world famous CCM singer, chances are you will not come away disappointed. Recommended."
1,What a waste!,"Bought a brand new Hydroslide kneeboard for well over $200.00 and the first time ever to be pulled the strap broke while riding flat between the wake. Sent me face first in the lake. Returned the board to the store for a new one. After 1 day on the lake same thing! The strap keeps breaking at the stitching on the ""shock"" side of the strap. I rate this 0 stars! Waiting to hear back from Hydroslide because I can't keep returning broken strap kneeboards to the store once a week."
5,very nice,"I wasn't familier with Lori Cullen before I heard a cut of this on Tonic. I enjoyed it and I bought this CD. Really she has a haunting voice and this is a nice CD with covers of songs by Randy Newmann, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Nilson, Joni Mitchell, Gordon Lightfoot, Richard Thompson and some of Lori's own. Very nicely done."
3,WV Weather,This product was ordered for a mail carrier and wasn't quite what we thought it would be...however for moderately cold weather...he said it serves its purpose.
2,Cools easily,"I was disappointed with the ability of this fabric to keep me warm. The fabric would cool right down when exposed to the cold. My wife had a good response to these. Although, she too discovered that the fabric needed an outer layer to keep the warmth in."
4,All kinds of messed-up...,"The third album by the very screwed-up industrial band Vampire Rodents is, as expected, very screwed-up. Their sample-based compositions are disjointed and discombobulated and thoroughly enjoyable if you're into that kind of thing. They established their ""demented children's music"" idiom in both their artwork and their use of Loony Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoon samples, something that composer Daniel Vahnke would exploit more heavily on future VR releases and in his side project Ether Bunny. Chemlab's Jared Hendrickson-cum-Louche and Babyland's Dan Gatto contribute vocals to several songs."
1,impossible book,"As a graduate student in accounting, I've found this book to be the most difficult and the most frustrating to read amongst my collection. This book is certainly not helpful to visual learners as there is mostly very dull text explanation of the subject material. Also, the few in-chapter examples worked out are very difficult to decipher and are poorly explained, so you're left on your own to learn how to do the end of chapter problems."
2,Hit and miss...but generally confusing,"This book goes on and on about minor details, sometimes repeating the same irrelevant or simple ideas over and over, and providing excruciatingly drawn-out background information that is basic business, and then when it comes to the big stuff, gives incomplete explanations and illustrations and leaves out critical pieces of information.I often felt left to my own devices to figure out how to document certain transactions...going through the same section dozens of times and finding not even a rudimentary explanation for exactly what the section is supposed to cover.It's hit and miss, but overall very disappointing.I recall being particularly disappointed with its explanation of consolidations with regard to foreign subsidiaries."
5,Works Great,"This is a great product. Very simple to operate and does a great job tying down loads whether on the roof, in a trailer or in the back of our SUV."
3,It died,"I've had this TV for a little over three years I think. It just died (it won't power on).- I'm glad actually, it gives me an excuse to buy a flat screen of some sort with HDMI jacks.- Worst thing about this TV was the remote. You couldn't jump to a particular input, you had to click through all of them. Even ones not-in-use."
5,"Awesome, Awesome, and more awesome!","This was an awesome graphic novel! It take two already awesome characters, gives them their own title and makes them even better! If you liked the characters Sam and Twitch in the Spawn comics and the Spawn animated series, you'll love them in their own title. if i could give this book more thanfive stars I would. It was well worth the money and the time. buy it! now!"
3,lasts about a month,"bought two, cause I think wayfarers are cool but Ray bans are overrated.one trip in a checked in bag to NY did them in.cheap stuff.Literally.3 stars."
2,Look great - touchy quality,"I bought both the black and tortoise colors. They both look great on after a bit of adjusting, but the black pair split the rim at the lens after 2 days of wear. The tortoise color pair loose at the arm hinges but are still ok.Wasn't expecting much b/c of the price anyway..."
4,cooking,It must take a lot of practice to use these stamps. Some cookies stamped beautifully; others you couldnt tell what the stamp was.
5,Interesting slice of St Louis mid 1800's history.,"German American history from the 1840's through 1870's in St Louis Missouri. thought a translated from German book would be dull, but with a bit of perseverance, I really ended up enjoying Mr. Borenstein's memoir. this book began with a chunk of background information that was necessary for stepping into this Chapter of his history. the book contains many of the elements of a good fiction piece but its Biographical. the translator keeps Henry in check with exaggeration or errors in memory. I am sure the background of being a newspaper owner/editor and an actor helped sculpt the story and style, but to make history interesting is no crime. The circles of peers that cross Henry Boernesteins path are some of the big players of the time- both in Europe and America. I was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyment derived from the book."
4,Very good read,"I am in the process of reading all of Carla Kelly's books. I find them all wonderful, and this one is no exception. It was weaker than the first book in the story, ""Libby's London Merchant"" but that is probably because Libby's London Merchant was so good that it was hard to live up to it. I loved all the characters, and enjoyed running into Libby and Tony again, as well as Scipio and Jane from ""Miss Milton Speaks Her Mind."" Another reviewer mentioned that this is a novel for those who prefer some depth in their romance novels. I agree - it is nice to have some meatier reading with more depth in the relationships, not only the ones between the hero and heroine, but between all the characters.Now is the time to buy/read Carla Kelly books, as many of them are out of print! I have already spent way too much money on buying used copies that cost 3 and 4 times as much as they did when they were first published. But it's worth it!"
5,I Loved the Duke of Nesbitt,"I enjoyed watching his transformation starting in ""Libby's London Merchant"". He's not perfect, even at the close of the story he still has a ways to go but he was believable to me. I enjoy it when the main characters, especially the hero, have flaws like real human beings. We see him at the opening still holding onto his feelings for Libby, still hurting from her rejection and by the end finally letting her go. When he comes across the girl and her son by the road in the poaring rain, he doesn't want to help but he finds himself wondering, and not for the first time either, 'What would Libby do?' which becomes his mantra whenever similar circumstances arise. And the relationship between him and his valet is very tender, more like father and son the way his valet dotes on him.And the rape scene wasn't as graphic as some reviewers make it out to be. It was tame in comparison to some others I've read."
5,A Lovely sequel To Libby's London Merchant,"I almost gave it a 4 because I like some of her other books better, but it is still such a good book and excellent writing"
2,Disappointing for Kelly,"Carla Kelly's books are usually warm and witty. I was looking forward to this new entry and found it to be subpar at best. The book is written from the point of view of the hero and he was likable enough, but I could never figure out why he liked the heroine. The resolution in the end was too easy and the conflict of the book handled poorly."
3,ariel costume,"No size indicated so this product had to be taken to a seamstress once received (its a 6x and my daughter is a 10)but, with a little extra fabric under the sleeve area -- it was fine. Cute, nice colors -- it was on sale so it was really worth the price."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK MORE LIKE A MERMAID COSTUME... IT'S OKAY BUT I'VE SEEN BETTER
2,Ariel costume ok,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and it is really pretty. The Only thing is that the first time I put it on her and opened the velcro in the back, the netting tore. Each time she wears it, it tears even more. A little high for poor quality."
3,Smelly and bigger than advertised,"When we took it out of the box, the smell was abhorrent. Two weeks later, it still smelled pretty bad. It makes me wonder what it was made of. It was also a very large dress. My kids are 2, 3, and 4. Even on my 4 year old it was too big. Next time we'll buy the one we had last year, with the purple halter-top & green skirt with fins. It fit all the girls and didn't have that pesky odor."
2,No cover or mention of any form of modern paganism,"This book does a great job of covering a variety of religions today, but fails to mention - as most books in this category do -anything about the modern pagan movement. In North America alone, there are millions of practicing pagans. Our beliefs are of no less value than any other religion. I'm sirprised that Wicca isn't even covered in these books; as Wicca is officially a santified religion in the United States.Paganism is an Earth-centered spirituality and focuses on love and reverence for All Life and our Mother Earth. It deserves recognition. How will my children feel, as we read through books on religions of the world, when even the most obscure religions are covered, but not their own?I don't care what religion you follow or what preconceptions/misconceptions you have about paganism. For a complete and tolerant world view, it's a crime not to address this prevalent form of spirituality."
5,Little City DVD,Great! Came very quickly! Had never been opened. Really good movie. Recommend others use this seller!
5,JON BON JOVI IS GREAT!,"This movie is really good. It is one of those twisted love stories. Who will end up with who? the cast is a bunch of late 20 - early 30 year old people in San Francisco. there is lots of flirting, hooking up, breaking up, leaving eachother, bisexual experimentation,...(it's kinda like jerry springer's show) anyway...the characters are well written and acted. the scenery is nice, especially jon bon jovi. and the plot keeps you interested. there is no way you can turn this movie off without knowing who ends up with who at the end. this movie is also loaded with theraputic metafores. each character has their own method. they include: AA meetings, church confession, a CB radio,and a shrink. REALLY GOOD MOVIE! and for all of the jon bon jovi fans, he does have a good size role in this movie. i definately recommend buying this movie!"
3,Good Quality Case,While the build quality of this case was pretty darn good there was a design flaw that did not work well with my LG phone. See in the picture how the strap comes over the top of the phone and then attaches to the front of the case? That's done by a magnet sewn into the front of the case. There was not enough padding on the inside of the case and the clear window on the outside of the phone got all scratched up.I switched to a different phone before i realized the problem and didn't try this but maybe a work-around might be to put the phone in with the back of the phone facing outward. This might eliminate the scratches.
1,Item came not as shown or described,"Was looking for a nice cover that would work with a small flip phone as it looked like it did in the picture shown. This came to me today (I paid for 1 day shipping) and this was NOT for a flip phone but for an ""HTC Droid Eris or similar sized phone"" (pictured at the top of the box it was in). The belt clip does NOT swivel. Be cautious in buying this item. ALSO, they state size on the back of the box as ""4.45H x 2.2W x 0.58D. That is NOT what the product description shows as the size."
4,Cell Phone Holster,"Holder works well. the phone is a little tight making it hard to get out, but that is probably better than too loose. I hope it loosens a little with time. Have had for a few months and have not had any problems. It would be nice if I could plug into charger at bottom without having to remove from the holster. The swivel clip works well and I have not had problems with it. For the price, it was a great buy."
1,Unavailable,Currently unavailable..... bought a holster at Radio Shack.... it was available. Doesn't rotate but otherwise meets my needs at this time.
1,Holster was not the one I ordered!!,"The one in this picture is what I expected to receive. The one I received does not have the rotating clip. That is false advertising. Sorry, not happy!!"
3,clip comes off,"Regarding the Cellet cell phone holster, The belt clip is not very secure. It comes off the pouch. Overall its just o.k."
2,Cellet Small Soft Cell Phone Universal Holster / Pouch / Case with Swivel belt clip,HAD IT 3 MONTHS AND THE PIN FELL OUT OF THE CHEAP CLIP. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE 4 ANY KIND OF CONSTRUCTION WORK. DOES NOT SWIVEL.
1,poor service,"they do not have this size phone case,i have talked to them after recieving the wrong one,and they sent me another case in it's place.and it wasn't the right one either.so as far as i know they do not have this size.they have the size bigger,but not this one."
2,Too small,This item was way to small for the phone I that believe it tobe. I should have had a dime or something to scale it by.But if I had a cell phone that fit it. It would be a good holder.Regards.
1,Unless the picture is just too poorly angled to see it ...,"It looks like the ""clip"" depends on putting super glue on your belt, because I don't see any hook at the bottom to keep your winter coat from riding up and pulling your phone with it, only to drop it in a storm drain later on. Another example of the stupidity of designers who don't use the garbage they design."
4,DVD,"BEST OF THE DVD OFFERINGS OF THIS MOVIE...NOT THE BEST QUALITY, BUTIT IS UNDERSTANDABLE AND VIEWABLE...AN ENJOYABLE GLIMPSE OF GINGER ROGERS BEFORE HER SLIM DANCING DAYS"
1,Not made for the classroom,"After viewing this movie in class my fifth grader came home with a very confusing view about his inter-racial parents. If this movie is to be shown in a classroom I feel that the teacher and school should seek the consent of all parents before showing it. I didn't have that opportunity. Although it might have been a learning lesson for some, it was not a good experience for my child."
4,Worth watching,"A good movie to understand the atmosphere in the south in the 1960s. I'd recommend you read the book, or read about Ruby's life, first. Like most Disney movies, Ruby Bridges wraps up with a nice, don't-they-all-get-along kind of ending. In reality, it was 2 years before Ruby played with any kids at the school, and her teacher was fired at the end of the year.Also pleasing - the family's faith is portrayed accurately, and the power of Ruby's constant prayer is not edited out.A great film for our family. Recommended!"
4,Great Educational Movie,"This is really great to educate people on the struggles of integrating schools. It was a little too focused on the religious aspect to show the whole movie in a classroom setting though. Other than that, I would definitely suggest this movie to anyone."
4,'IN GOOD TASTE',"This movie did what is called, ""tell the truth"", but in good taste. Why do I say that? Well it showed how people really can be, but ugly does not have to prevail. Good is a universal description."
5,The original classic of populism,"John Hicks wrote this, the original classic, of the populist movement. It is easy to read and flows smoothly from page to page. It is very thorough and is the most in-depth book I know of about the Farmers' Alliance. An excellent history! Begin with this classic, then read Goodwyn and McMath and you will have all you ever need on the history of the Populist movement! A must have!"
2,I JUST DON'T GET THIS OTHER REVIEWER,"Is it just me, or does anyone else understand what the previous reviewer is saying? I mean, does he like this album or doesn't he?! If you ask me, it is just a bunch of old fogies playing what sounds like broken instruments, thus my two-star rating.In closing, I think the previous reviewer is in desparate need of mental help..."
3,Good book - watch the errors,"I found this book very helpful in passing the NT Workstation exam. The practice questions were good, and many of the exam questions appeared on my actual test. Be sure to visit the Sybex Web site for errata, though. There were more errors than I like to see, but the errata covered the major ones. All things said, I recommend this book."
3,"Informative, but has several errors in technical content.","I found this book easy to read and liked the test questions. I did find several errors that could mislead someone with no experience with the product. Overall, I would give it a good rating."
2,A good book crippled by bad editing.,"This book was very hard to get through simply because of the editing errors. The test questions are useless because the answer keys are mismatched. Lammle has written some good books, and his teaching style is very effective. However, I have to recommend anyone looking to cram for the Workstation exam skip this book."
1,So many errors!,"There are so many errors in this book, including wrong answers to the sample tests and study questions."
5,This was the best review book I used!,I used many books to prepare for my exam but this is the one I attribute my successful score of 965 on my first exam. The review section was almost the same as the exam!Check the web site for updates though. There were some errors in printing that are corrected at the web site.
1,Bad book,"I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example."
4,Good intro to a classic story,"I use this version of Peter and the Wolf when I teach music classes to young children. I also use a separate CD (a good one is narrated by Leonard Bernstein).The reason I like to use this edition for the younger kids is because in the end the duck actually comes out of the wolf alive, even though that's not the way it originally was written."
5,A case for case,"I have been following and buying Peter Case recordings since Echo Wars.Down to earth lyrics, simple but memorable melodies and the ability to produce great songs year after year.I buy them all and have not been disappointed yet.Particularly significant songs: Spell of Wheels and On the Way Downtown.caslo"
3,Seems to include poems by other poets,"Robertson's a good poet, but this book is padded out with poems by Neruda and Montale, as well as some close reworkings of Ovid. The end result feels not very original."
2,Adequate musicianship with precious lyrics,"While I feel the musicians on this CD are talented, I can't help but feel that nothing new is going on here. The songs are all pretty simplistic, melodically, and the lyrics are just far too ""cute"" for my taste. Perhaps the Uninvited will come out with a release with more innovation and less fancy word-smithing in the future, but until then, I'll pass."
3,Not What You're Expecting,"I read this story because I love reading the originals of classic stories we're used to hearing parodies of. This book is extremely different than the Frankenstein story we think about in America today. It is well worth the read if only to see those differences and marvel at how much the story has changed over the years. But if you're just looking for a good horror or fantasy/sci fi work I'd keep moving. The book itself is slow, and skips over almost all of what little action there is, choosing instead of spend time on the psychology of the monster and creator."
2,Not as enjoyable as I had hoped.,If we set aside the fact that this is the first real stab at Science Fiction and look at the book solely on it's merits. It really wasn't very good. The actions of the characters aren't even plausible and in many cases utterly ridiculous. Not to mentopn the pages and pages of whining. I only finished it to get to the payoff at the end.......and there wasn't one. It was quite disappoining especially considering that I have been reading many of the classics lately and found them to be better than I'd hoped.
2,Horrible! MUST READ REVIEW!,"the book explains the story in such a slow way it makes the reader go to sleep while reading! i didn't believe that was possible until i read the book. it is so difficult to understand. the theme is good but it has bad wording. the creature starts out knowing no english. all the sudden he knows big words that english scholars can't even understand. this book puts the ""BAD"" in ""horrible"". i know that doesn't makes sense but neither does the book."
1,Frankenstein,This book was alright but it got boring pretty fast and to me it kept on repeating the same things over and over again.
3,Interesting read,This is the first time that I've read this book. It was not what I expected and took sometime to get into the guts of it.
1,A terrible book,"I'll make my review of this book simple. I don't understand why this book is considered such a masterpiece of literature. This book is extremely boring; I had to force myself to finish the stupid thing. The book did have a few good points to it within the theme, but the way they were written was dreadful."
3,Old book,"This book, printed in 1940 is the origin of the pamphlet ""Handicraft Guide No. 8, Fly Tying"" published by the Special services Division of the U. S. Army during WW II."
3,AN INTERESTING BOOK,"Here we have a book and an author that have positive and negative points. Donald Wandrei, of Arkham House fame was not a very good writer. His two best works, in my opinion, were ""THE WEB OF EASTER ISLAND"" and ""THE BLINDING SHADOWS"". But for the most part, he was almost a hack-writer, putting forth a production not always very exceptional. This book is quite an example of that. An anthology comprised of mostly low-grade stories. We wouldn't give it 3 stars but for the fact that Wandrei was an important figure in Lovecraftiana and in the growth of Arkham House and every Lovecraft Addict should know about him. Also, Fedogan & Bremer always do an excellent work on their products and this is definitely the case. All in all, if you have spare money, by all means, buy it!You won't be dissapointed."
5,This Movie Rocks!!!!!,This movie has a great storyline with well developed characters. Alyssa is great in this movie. This is one of her best roles yet. Jamie Luner is also very convincing as the very nasty Sabrina. Great movie. I could watch it a million times in a row without getting bored. Alyssa is a great actress and this is a great movie for any Alyssa fan. (Alyssa is not the star though) I would recomend this to anybody.
3,Functionality vs. Aesthetics,"This product is very functional except the fact that it is much bigger than I imagined. I am living out a back pack for the next three months and determining where this will go just got a little more interesting. However, it does serve its purpose of carrying and protecting documents, but for two people only one is needed."
4,"Well, for me it was very good","I have heard people, and critics who say that this film it's bad, well i don't think so, the acting was great, the storyline was good,the dialouge was good, and, well here is my report card for the film Acting: ***** Plot:**1/2 Entertainment value:*****1/2 Story and character development:***1/2 Smartness:**** Originality:*1/2Okay, the only flaw for me was the plot, it was just way too short!, and i don't care about cliches, but in here there were just fun, well here goes a message to those guys, who say that is bad, about the theory of Cydonia, and the origin of life on earth: You just have no imagination and such religious inteloreance."
3,"i liked it, but...","I REFUSE TO BELIVE THAT BRIAN""MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE""DE PALMA MADE THIS FILM ITS GOT TO BE SOME OTHER GUY WITH THE SAME NAME.IF ONLY HITCHCOCK HAD MADE A SCI-FI MOVIE WE WOULD HAVE A FOUR STAR CLASSIC ON OUR HANDS."
2,Another film wasted,"This movie has great space visuals and it is OK during the first three quarters, the space walk sequence is very good and suspenful. But that silly and obvious ending with those cheap CGI...why, why?! I just don't get how a talented director like the De Palma did not object to that childish/ET and unoriginal ending that instead of awe it leaves you embarassed. Shame on Hollywood, that had two shots at the martian exploration theme (Red Planet, another waste, perhaps slightly better than this), and none of them delivered.Review update: the 'Face of Mars', even BEFORE this movie was made, everyone knows that is just a big hill; the 'Face' was seen only because low picture resolution with 70s technology and the shadows created with sun lighting at a certain martian hour. That killed the movie for me. And this movie pretends to be serious sci-fi? Go and read some past century news you movie story writers..."
1,Uggh!,"Ughh! I feel sorry for all of the amazing talent involved in this film. Every one of the actors, the director & composer are capable of solid work and it does not show one bit. It painful to watch as cliche after cliche is SLOWLY marched before you to wonder over. There are so many holes in this story's logic. The main violation is the script, but I feel the direction for this was just off as well. Disney's ridiculous RocketMan, about a trip to Mars, is a much better film (and that's as silly as a film can get)."
2,THIS is not an action movie,M2M is the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. The screenplay is horrible. The special effects were very good but even that was ruined by lack of music during the action sequences. The ending was stupid too. It made the movie seem like the beginning of a 3 hour movie. The only thing this movie has to offer is the part where one of the astronauts gets twisted into pieces.
1,They don't get much worse than this!,"The title above says it all...this is just a terrible movie! I'm a sci-fi nut who will watch almost anything. This movie, however? Don't waste your time!"
2,Do not purchase this film unless you enjoy throwing away $$$,"This ""film"" was a waste of resources in Hollywood. Though it had some very nice (ILM generated) special effects, they still could not pull the film out of the 'wish I'd never seen it' category. The first crew had a bad experience and only Don Cheadle (Boogie Nights, Out of Sight) is left marooned on Mars. A rescue team goes up over a year later (if I remember correctly) to try to salvage the mission. Only Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump, Ransom) could unlock the secrets of the Universe with M&M's! With almost a supporting role in the poorly directed film, M&M/MARS (! ) must have really dropped a load of cash to have that happen. I guess they're still sore about passing up E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. Don't waste your time."
4,Decent sci-fi film.,Astronauts find evidence that intelligent life once lived on Mars. Something goes wrong and all but one astronaut are killed. Later a mission is launched to find out what happened to the previous crew and why.
4,Great Effects!!!!!!!!!,"Mission to Mars was a decend movie. Great special effects and good plot. The picture quality was perfect. Very 3-D, no dirt, and no enhancment. The sound was perfect too. It had great suppliments that told the story of the making of this film. The only problem was it's PG rating. It had tomuch violence to be PG. It should be PG-13. If it wasn't for that it would get a 5 star rating."
5,"Not the Best Sci-Fi ever, but very entertaining!","If you have browsed the reviews for this movie, you already know that it has not faired well. I loved this movie and think it got a bad rap because people expected something different than what they actually saw. The ending was surprising and fresh. The special effects are outstanding. If you are a sci-fi fan, you've got to have this DVD! The acting was good--especially for a sci-fi movie. If you liked Armageddon, you'll like this one."
2,"Empty, unimaginative, unrealistic","This movie is quite unimaginative, just a ripoff collection. From other great sci-fi movies such as the masterpiece 2001, and its sequel 2010, The Abyss and The Close Encounters.. When I decided to watch this movie I thougth that a scifi movie with great actors (Sinise & Robbins) can't be bad. But it was bad. It had an empty screenplay and stupid scenes & characters such as the histerical housewife astronaut (Connie Nielsen). All the ""epic clichés"" were used. Sucks.. I just added 2 stars because of the ILM's and Dream Quest Image's special effects."
2,duuuummmmb,"This movie cant decide if it's a horror movie (at the beginning) or a 2001 remake (near the end). It plays like a tv movie, and it's quite silly at times. It seems like they took two Mars movies, stuck them together and tried to come up with another one. Avoid this movie if you enjoy sci-fi."
2,Bad Science/Fiction!,"Chardboard characters, hokey sci/fi elements and laughable dialogue are the only things this film has to offer. And the worse thing is the movie insults the viewer's intelligence. As with all De Palma films this one has a memorable suspense sequence, that is the tornado attack, and that's about as good as it gets, everything goes downhill from there, and that's only 20 min. into the film. With a pace that drags and a plot that we couldn't care less, the film becomes a 'waiting cycle' for the humans to meet the aliens. And not even the ending pays off, with an alien that looks so awful, that we begin to wonder who thought of this. Some amusing elements, such as De Palma's ode to '2001', by choosing the space suits similar to those of that Sci-Fi classic. The cast is also nothing short of boring, but it's not really their fault, they didn't have the right material. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 3!"
1,WHUT?,This movie made no sense and was a waste of talented actors. How can I say more than that? The End.
5,The Definition Of A Good Science-Fiction Film,"This movie is an excellent science-fiction film. You can get the synopsis of the film by reading other reviews. 'Mission to Mars' is a brilliant film, here is why:1) The story is very engrossing...yes, it is far-fetched, but this is why it is called science-fiction.2) Realistic special-effects...The shots of the spacecraft and the CG terrain of Mars makes you feel like you are watching an actual NASA mission.3) The soundtrack is one of the best I have heard in a movie...watch the end scene and you will see why.4) Great acting by great actors: Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle...5) It has very '2001' Kubrick-style cinematography throughout it.Overall, I thought this movie was a delight to watch. In my opinion, it does not deserve all the one-star ratings that it got...it may not be a perfect sci-fi film to some people, but it is a well told fictional story that should be seen by all movie-lovers.5/5"
5,So dorky but still a good movie :),"Ok, it's not Star Wars or Signs, but it's still a good movie. My husband thinks I've lost my mind but I still like it anyway. Maybe it's because it reminds of those old 1950's classics like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still."" :) Even the music is bizarre - LOL! But for some reason I do love this movie- ha!! It will go into my ""classics"" collection :) Also I really liked Jerry O'Connell as Phil, Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise. All excellent actors. :) If there was a movie worse than this, it is ""Red Planet"" with Val Kilmer. Val was better as Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone."""
1,All That Money and For What?????,"I heard about the millions it took to make this movie.I know the talent involved and after watching the movie, I just want to know why? This was a regular tv movie that cost too much and was a waste of talent and theories."
3,Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be!,"Why, oh why is this poor film recieving such ""bad press""? It really is'nt that bad at all! I feel, in contrast, that films like ""Supernova"" and ""Pitch Black are way over-hyped! If you don't want to buy this DVD, then at least rent it. It is worth a watch. It really does'nt deserve the ""lambasting"" it's getting!"
1,"Houston, We Have a Problem","I've seen bad movies before, yes, and I've reviewed them on this web site, and most of the time my main criticism is the lack of good plotting. It's not that ""Mission to Mars"" is badly plotted, it's just that the plot doesn't become clear until ten minutes before the movie ends! And then we don't care, because we've already turned it off!Made thirty years too late, ""Mission to Mars"" is a poor man's ""2001"" just go sub Strauss for Van Halen. The actual idea for the film is quite good, but simply mangled in a difficult plot structure, bad script, and lack of purpose. We get character development at the places where we need storyline, and we get diatribe speeches and dragged out scenes where need editing. It's all in the wrong place, and the movie is a complete bust for all involved."
1,Horrific,"I saw this movie the other day on a cross-country flight. After the movie, half the people watching it let out an audible gasp; it was that awful. And, it was free (United Airlines does not charge a fee for their movies). What a waste of time (should have read the book I had with me). I found the gratuitous advertising by sponsors (Kawasaki on the side of a spacecraft, Dr. Pepper space drinks) to be intrusive. At least on TV I can switch channels if I don't want to see an ad. The dialogue was akin to the worst of the made for TV movies-- simplistic, silly, predictable and full of cliches. There was a potential for an interesting story but the movie never went anywhere, it just died and left me wondering ""Is that it?"" I'm not one to be so negative with my reviews, but this movie in my opinion, truly deserves only 1 star."
1,A storytelling debacle from start to finish,"This movie is about as thought-provoking as a canned ham. Despite a relatively strong cast of actors, the lines are clearly delivered by people who realize they've found themselves smack dab in the biggest storytelling flop I've ever seen. Everything about this movie [is bad]... the acting, the plot, all of it. Even the ending--which could have been imaginative and intriguing--winds up reminding you of the sound a balloon makes when the air's squirting out. I can't imagine any movie containing less enthusiasm than this one."
1,Too bad the writers did not crash on Mars,"I won't waste my time trashing this movie with a long review. You will have more fun reading all the reviews on this site telling you how stupid it was. Here are some samples: a man lives in a tarp on the surface of Mars, Dr. Pepper is plugged throughout, a face comes to life on the planet, professional astronauts on an urgent rescue mission are more interested in dancing to Van Halen (no wonder they crash the ship)...Dumb plot, dumb action, dumb effects, and I am dumb for having paid to watch it. This is Hollywood at its worst. You will wish the actors had all been taken away by aliens, never to return, after seeing this stupid flick. Get some popcorn, throw this movie in the fire and watch it burn."
1,Not quite as good as Plan 9 From Outer Space,"Sadly this movie doesn't qualify in any category, not even ""worst sci-fi movie of all time."" At least Plan 9 contained scenes to make you laugh; this movie just makes you cringe from start to finish. It combines bad plot with wooden dialog, bad acting, tired direction, and an overall story-line that is riddled with cringe-making errors and stupidities. This is the kind of movie stoned teenage drop-outs would make if someone was foolish enough to give them the resources. Even the title is flat. My own party-game (dreamed up in order to survive the movie, which my children wanted to watch until they too gave up in disgust) was to invent better titles referencing older sci-fi classics. My favorite: The Day The Bowel Movement Stood Still. Runner up: Clueless Encounters of the Turd Kind.In short, avoid this movie unless you want to know up-close how it must feel to have an aneurism."
1,...,"Worst thing I've seen for a long time. Moronic scenario from beginning to end (that poor I don't remember his name who can't go to Mars because his wife chose the wrong moment to die, and who finishes as the first man transformed into dog-food for martians, ...). No rythm, weak special effects, poor acting, and I don't even remember the music (most probably the same as in every ""grand spectacle"" american movie). After seing that yesterday, I had to watch 2001, as a medicine. Very effective !"
1,"OK, it sucked","I expected the worst out of this movie and got just that. For the first hour, nothing happens; mostly 'quality' NASA equiptment being broken. When you see the ending, you think the movie is bad, but then when you think about it some more it turns out to be a really bad movie. None of it makes sense at all and leaves the movie so unfinished. I can't recommend it."
1,"Great actors, bad acting, bad script, BAD, BAD, BAD","Yipes, I feel as thought a part of my life was stolen by this awful film. How can you put so many great actors in a movie and make them look so bad? I dont know. This movie made me want to watch it to the end just to see how bad it was going to be. The metallic ""alien"" at the end had me laughing out loud. This could have been a great movie if it was done by a Lucas or a Spielberg, or even myself. To put it harshly I would rather sit through Yentl, Mary Rielly, Ishtar and and a five day insurance seminar than be subjected to this film again. Luckily I never had to pay to see it. Sorry dePalma."
1,If only I were able to give 0 or negative stars.....,"THE absolute worst movie I have seen in 10 years -- I went in with the lofty expectation of a 2001 caliber film and left saddened that I had just wasted 2 unrecoverable hours of my life. Do NOT under any circumstance agree to buy or see this movie, unless you want to watch simply for the pure enjoyment of ridiculing this film."
2,Alien Guys with Big Heads,"This film is unbelievable. It brings the audience all the way to the end of the film and then the filmmakers really don't have an ending. You essentially get another ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE type ending, which has been used too many times now. After seeing MISSION TO MARS I can now appreciate a film like EVENT HORIZON which chose a graphically violent alternative but dared to be different and challenge the viewer."
1,Weak,The special FX didn't make up for the weak storyline and the poor acting. The alien encounter is laughable to say the least. Don't bother with this one.
1,Plan 9.,"Somebody please explain how they got fine actors like Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins to participate in this insipid bomb. The dialog is so dumb, corny and obvious it must be for young children. But the early scenes will frighten them. Sappy music, too. Its terrible when characters in a movie explain things that are obvious! Even when it ended, I sat on the couch, stunned at how lousy it was."
4,As realistic as it gets,"With a full license from NASA to use both it's logo and it's Mars strategies, this movie is by far, the most realistic ""lets go to Mars"" film ever released. The technology is all scientifically feasible, the activities in space are based on current theoretical knowledge. Even landing and living on Mars is based on real knowledge. In fact, very little of this movie delves into the fantasy. Only the ""big ending"" really makes a leap from science to fiction (though, some theoriest would argue that the movies ending is also ""possible""). In any case, I found this movie extremely entertaining and have added the DVD to my collection."
2,A beautiful bad movie,"I'd give this movie one star, but it is so nice to look at, that I have to give it two. Rather than reiterate what others have said in their reviews, I'll just offer this piece of advice... Turn down the sound, pop in a nice classical CD and watch the movie starting with the first scene on Mars. This should make the movie watchable. Of particular note is the spacewalk scene which you will really enjoy if you can't hear the dialogue and don't realize how utterly absurd it is."
3,it isn't that bad.,"I found this film to be quite watchable and the time seemed to pass quickly, except for a slow begining. There are some plot problems and not always the best acting. But it is a interesting what if? movie. The martian landscape was awsome as was some of the effects. Apart from being a little to upbeat for the ending I did enjoy it. It is questionable if the rewatch value is there, so you may want to consider that if you are thinking of buying it."
3,Fair Warning,"Great movie up to the point where the big door goes up and they go into the solar system room. You'll know what I mean when you get to it. Now shut off the tape and imagine the rest. All that mystery and suspense so excellently maintained goes to pot in a meeting with a bad CGI alien and a horrible, awful, cliche ending that doesn't really explain anything.Just shut it off at that point and imagine your own ending and the movie will be tons better!"
1,"Started out ok, but fell apart...","This movie didn't start out too bad, but just when it started getting interesting, the movie went off and got stupid. I mean, the whole movie was building up to this meeting with the aliens, and well, not to give it away, but I'll just say it's a major letdown.Go and buy the 2001/2010 series, they're much more interesting!"
1,Absolutely Terrible Fiction,I cannot call it science fiction because the writers had obviously never learnt any science. They manage to contradict all of Newton's Laws of motion and yet still create a film that is so mind numbingly boring and badly constructed that it defies belief. How a movie like this can get made now is beyond me. It's trash like this that is stopping mankind's real journey to Mars.
1,"The movie that 40,000 feet couldn't help...","I saw this movie on a trip to Japan. The batteries in my walkman died and my extra batteries were in my suitcase which was checked. The laptop batteries just died as well, so I had no other choice but to watch this movie. That being said, I would have rather poked my out with a hot poker than watch this movie.It starts out with the astronaut cliches that were done much better on The Right Stuff and then there was the requisite accident and Tim Robbins waving and saying, ""No, no please don't rescue me. I want out of this movie now."". Then there were the other scenes and a scene reminiscent of the scene from 2001, but not as good.One would think that a movie with Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise couldn't be bad, but man....."
1,Horrid,"The movie was absolutely mind-numbing torture. Not only was the dialogue contrived, but the movie lacked suspense (mostly I think due to the cheese organ music that almost put me to sleep...not even 50's sci-fi movies have music that bad). It also lacked intelligence, dimensionality, and well anything else you can think of going bad in a movie. I must say I was surprised that a movie could be so bad in this era, but then again, it *is* a mainstream movie. No one said Kubric owned the license on ""serious"" space movies but unlike the DMV, they should be more selective who they give licenses to."
1,"quite simply, the worst film i have ever seen.","i will make it as clear as possible. If you have 25 dollars to spend, you'd be better off paying someone to kick you in the face. throughout the film, there were moments when i questioned my own existence, wondering how i could be genetically connected to the makers of this film, the most uncreative morons God ever created. If i have saved one person from buying this movie, i will have insured a safe place in heaven. If you want a real compelling sci-fi movie, get 2001."
2,Lost in Cliche,"It's really a shame that this movie, which, given the talent pool, might have been good, disappoints. We don't yet have a good manned-mission-to-Mars movie, and it would be good to have one, since the possibility we'll eventually have such a mission is still there. I think the movie has some bright spots: Gary Sinese is good and the whole middle sequence involving the rescue mission--in between Earth and Mars--is actually exciting and well-executed. There bright spots, and the movie probably does not deserve the horrendous reviews. And, it is nowhere near so-bad-it's-good territory, but it certainly fails. It is just so hopelessly derivative. The dialogue cliches are painful but, more importantly, we have such a clear amalgam of aspects of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters, and The Abyss, that the movie comes off as having no fresh ideas. You just hate to see talent like this wasted."
1,I Loved The Ending,"I loved the ending of Mission to Mars so that I could break the DVD in half. I do not think I have seen such a slow-moving and boring movie in my life.Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins should have their SAG cards ripped away from them for starring in this piece of tripe.Bad dialogue, bad cinematography, extremely slow moving plot and over acting make this definately one of the all time worst movies EVER."
1,What a Waste of Time,"I thought that this was going to be one of the best movies that I had seen in a long time. With talent like Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, and Brian De Palma, you couldn't think that things could go so wrong. What there was in the special effects department were done well, but other than that I absolutely hated this movie. The story was so choppy and seemed drawn out. The pivotal and really dramatic scenes were hokey as well. I love De Palma's work. Snake Eyes was at least a well done movie. This on the other hand was a total waste of time and money to even produce such a thing. What were these people thinking?"
4,Unlike Leonard Maltin - I like using my brain,"Unlike Leonard Maltin - I like using my brain while being entertained. Brilliant, great Fx, thoughtful and imaginative - better than ""Red Planet"", in my opinion."
1,2001: A Space Odyssey - the complete idiots guide,"It's hard for me to watch actors whom I otherwise respect, saddled with such a terrible screenplay. In a general sense, all the elements of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" are present, repackaged into an ultra-simplified story. The movie takes forever to establish the characters with their attendant humaness and personalities... but the personalities do not play into the story at all; it's just filler. The physics ofweightless vacuum were just plain embarrassing -- giving sciencefiction a black eye. I haven't seen a movie this bad in a very long time. I almost didn't finish watching it. I'll never watch it a second time."
5,I liked it.,"I really liked this movie. I can't see why it is generating somuch negative critisism. The problem is a lot of people wanta lot of violence, profanity, nudity and everything else. I thought you really got the overlying view of what true friendshipand love is all about. These guys cared so much about theirfriend stuck in Mars, they were willing to risk a great deal tobring him back. Characters in the movie cared so deeply for eachother they were willing to make sacifrices. I guess it helps alsothat I am a huge Tim Robbins fan. If you have only seen him inlimited stuff--see more. He has many facets. Anyway don't takemy word, decide yourself:)"
1,FORGET IT.,"It si horrible, just that. From the acting thourgh the direction to the plot, everything is awful. How can people of the calibre of Robbins, De Palma and Sinise do a thing like this is beyond my compreension..."
4,If you like 2001 and Close Encounters ....,"Mission to Mars created for me the same sense of wonder I felt when 2001: a space odyssey first screened in Cinerama. Mission to Mars is not an action film, it's an event film. The film only gets 4 stars, because the ending is very much like the end of Close Encounters (see MTM, I don't want to give away the story).I cared about the astronauts, Mars seemed real and the craft design was as real as what Kubrick did 30 years before.The realism is like Apollo 13 with a Close Encounters and The Abyss style of ending.Excellent DTS sound on DVD. Bythe way I saw the film in Sony Dynamic Digital and there's only one scene on the Space Station where the camara rotates around all the actors that 8 channels made a difference over 6 channels at home."
1,The Abyss Goes to Mars,"OK: Start with ""The Abyss"". Replace the bottom of the ocean with Mars. Throw in some elements from ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters"". What you'd end up with would still be better than ""Mission to Mars"". To make it as awful, you'd need to make sure that no one associated with the movie knows anything about Newtonian physics or the difference between a base pair and a chromosome.OK, fine. The movie has great visual effects. They obviously spent a lot of money on them. But would it have broken the bank to hire a decent science consultant?"
1,Worst movie.....EVER,"This movie lacked everything including a story, original special effects, good acting and the ability to keep me awake. Don't pay money for this, borrow it from a friend so you can have a good laugh too."
4,"A Realistic ""Mars"" Film!!","This movie comes from the director of ""Mission:Impossible"", another great movie. I found this movie a bit slow in the beginning with the relationships being established but once we knew all the characters and their life histories, we were rocketed to ""Mars""and the movie took off fast. It's from this point on that the movie is non-stop action and surprise. The year is 2020 and it's the first manned mission to Mars. The special effects are so well-done that you feel you're actually on the red planet. You won't believe what the crew discovers, it will fascinate you. I thought the ending was spectacular.There are many extra's on this DVD, including Visual Effects Analyses, and a Documentary on the ""Visions of Mars"" that are great. I have been waiting for a ""Mars"" movie that was worth watching for a long time. That movie has finally arrived!!"
4,Spectacular film is let down by an abrupt ending.,"This film has some truly spectacular sequences-from the portrayal of the surface of Mars,and space travel,to a spectactular,and moving,spacewalk and attempted rescue.What lets the movie down are some illogical moments,like when the tornado starts and the astronauts(instead of fleeing immediately)stand and watch!And the alien is ill-conceived:it looked more like Woody Woodpecker in drag.A more humanoid alien would have been an improvement.Also the ending was far too abrupt.But the movies spectacular moments,and great production values,still make it interesting and a great ride to Mars.The portrayal of being on the Martian surface was innovative in that it was realistic, something not done in cinema before.This makes the movie worth seeing."
2,Think Bad Soap Opera Set In Space,"I really wanted to like this movie. I love science fiction. Outer space dramas usually reel me right in. This one, not so much.It was an embarrassing waste of talent. Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, Tim Robbins ..... you just expect better from names like these.People giving this five stars can only be studio shills or worse. It was pretty bad."
4,Excellent and sensitive science fiction-better than most today,"I saw this movie on television, so I cannot speak to the DVD quality. On TV it was clear and vivid. The story was substantive, not overly-relying on special effect, although the special effects were excellent. The characters were well developed and you really empathized with them. There were some really heart-rending moments. The science was accurate- the laws of Newtonian orbital mechanics were faithfully portrayed and played an important role in the movie. There were parts near the end which were more speculative, but, all in all, the movie was much better than most Sci-Fi today."
5,Gotta c-it,This movie was awesome. Even for its age the grafix are great. Good story line as well. I saw it when it first came out and had to buy again!
2,Lackluster,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie on DVD recently but the film fails on so many levels. I don't know how such a dull movie could attract so many talented actors, (Don Cheadle, Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins and the incandescent Connie Nielson). I suppose on script, the premise is interesting. There is - what looks to be a face on Mars. I wish there was a more fascinating movie that would better imagine the mystery behind the face. But Mission to Mars is full of cliches - 'rescue one our own.' It ends just when things pick up a bit.The first hour of the movie could have just been prefaced in 5 minutes and then there would have been time for more interesting events to take place."
3,Half of a good movie,"I must say that the first half of the movie is very good. Great suspense, action and acting. The effects are good and the movie purrs like a porsche car after a tuning. Then they put cheap gas into it at the point of landing on Mars and this porsche starts to knock and ping like a pinto.(sorry just always wanted to use that analogy for a movie and it fits here)The script goes flat as soon as the rescue party lands on Mars and instead of anything good it just dries up and becomes more and more a waste of time. Still it's an OK time passer."
2,SNORE......,Being a Brian De Palma fan and a sci-fi fan I thought how could this movie go wrong- especially with Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins cast. Mission to Mars did not live up to it's hype. This movie was BORING from start to finish. Some of the special effects were exciting- other than this Mission to Mars was a major disappiontment.
2,"Boy, was this stupid!","This is not so much a film as a collection of scenes strung together with subtitles like ""Eighteen Months Later..."" The result is a disjointed picture that lurches to a finish that had me laughing to myself. This is the stupidest sci-fi ending since ""Independence Day"" -- without that picture's action to distract you. My two teenagers, by the way, both said at the end, ""That was really dumb."" 'Nuff said."
4,This movie was pretty good.,"I'd have to rate both Mission to Mars and Red Planet with four stars, although I did like Red Planet slightly better. I can recommend these two movies to anyone who likes things to do with astronomy and space, and has a vivid imagination about how things could be on another planet, as I do."
1,The horror...the horror....,"Nothing good can be said about this movie....It is cliche, bland...I can go on and on telling you how bad it is but why waste your time and mine?"
1,Gouge-Out-Your-Eyes Boring,"Many people have said how blatantly implausible this movie is from poorly thought out science to inept plot devices. Others have said that it gives an origin story for life on Earth that flies in the face of science as badly as ""scientific"" creationism. These people are right, but that's not why you should avoid the film. You should avoid this film because it is boring, boring, boring, boring, boring! If I had a sharp stick when I watched Mission to Mars, I would have stabbed myself in the eye just for the entertainment value."
1,Bad Science Fiction At Its Worse,This has to be one of the worst sci-fi movie to have been released in the last decade. The story line is absurd and the script is weak. No good actor could have saved this film from being the trash that it is. The good special effects don't help either: this movie is just plain stupid and not even worthy of one star!
2,20% Awsome 80% Awful,"I enjoyed the portion of the film that was about them getting to mars, and REALLY enjoyed the scene where they were making the space-walk transfer, but after that, it just got weird and stupid. And I normally like weird and stupid. Brian Depalma is great with suspense and character, but just like SNAKE EYES, this movie all ends up in the ""well that was stupid"" section."
3,the red zone,"I think this film is cool and spectacular but it's very predictable too,not at all thrilling but still good."
1,Watch you nails grow... is more fun.,"THIS MOVIE KEPT ME WONDERING... why did I pay for this? It is the worst movie I've ever seen. A complete disapointment. It has no story, very bad acting, some good special effects.A complete waste of time. Do anything but don't watch this movie."
3,o.k. but that's about it,"This certainly isn't the worst science fiction movie...look to Battlefield Earth or Red Planet for that. However it certainly isn't the greatest either.The story idea is good, centring as it does on a rescue mission from earth to rescue stranded astronauts on Mars. The effects are as high quality as you would expect in a modern sci-fi movie. Yet somehow it always feels as though something is missing and that the movie is never quite believable. The pace of the film is just too slow, the dialogue is corny at times and the characters too cliched. Only the acting ability of the cast saves it from becoming a mess of a movie.All in all it is movie that can be called OK; it is watchable and makes a pleasant change from the usual fast action movies in this genre. Just don't expect to be blown away by it."
2,2001 Ripoff with a poor story line,I only gave this movie two stars because of the audio and video transfer. I had pre-ordered this movie after all the hype I had heard about it and I was sadly disappointed after watching it. They seemed to have combined 2001 and the Lost in Space movie story together. Needless to say this did not work well and at the end I felt like I was watching an easy to explain version of 2001. The beauty of 2001 of course was that no explanation was given and the audience was left to figure out the ending on their own which even today viewers have different opinions of what the ending meant. Mission to Mars tried to explain everything so an elementary school child would understand it. I felt insulted by this and therefore I would strongly suggest either renting this DVD or missing it altogether. Get the new 2001 I am sure you will enjoy it more.
3,Better than average Sci-Fi movie,"I can't understand someone hating this movie. It is certainly better than the average Sci-fi film. The major flaw of this movie is that the material covered could use up a miniseries. It is choppy, with scenes taking place months after another. The biggest problem unfortunately has to do with the ending. This ending wasnt adequately built up and it is a glaring error that doesn't really work. It's interesting, just poorly executed. It's definitely worth watching however."
2,"Hokey, pokey","There's two ways to view M2M: either as a serious drama about a rescue mission to Mars; or as a space comedy. The special effects may be excellent, but the plot and acting are dubious. There's no creativity in the story. The opening is a rip-off of Apollo 13, and the talking computer is reminiscent of 2001: Space Odyssey. I was so taken back by how horrible this movie was I almost turned it off midway through. But I couldn't help but find myself laughing out loud. If I were to rate the movie as a drama, I would give it zero stars. If I were to rate it as a comedy, I'd give it about four stars, hence the two star rating I give it overall. If you you want a good laugh, this movie is better as a rental, don't waste your money buying it."
1,Do not see this film!,"This movie is terrible. Stay away from it, please!Predictable plot, atrocious performances (by good actors; the script is that bad), one-dimensional characterization; overall bad, highly derivative storytelling.I often disagree with prevailing mainstream movie criticism, but not on this one...this movie was a big enough waste of time and money before anyone saw it; don't was YOUR time and money, too!If only I could have given it zero stars..."
1,a comedy at best!,"During the scene when they finally meet the alien inside the dome, I began laughing uncontrolably in the cinema. How stupid and fake did that alien look!Gary Sinse looked like he had a face lift and that distracted me too much to pay any attention to anything he was saying..."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,Do not buy this movie do not rent this movie and most importand do not watch this movie. This was one of the worst movies ever made. The only thing that could possibly save this DVD would be if it were blank. This movie is destined to become a favorite of Mystery Science Theater or USA late night BAD movies.
2,"Low (brow), Slow (moving); sadly disappointing","I stumbled onto this movie tonight, knew nothing about it in advance, and decided to watch because of the great cast. All I can say is ""WOW."" Hard to believe this was ever really shown in a movie theater.REALLY slow pacing (which actually gets SLOWER as the movie goes on); really poorly written dialogue (full of cliches and ""captain obvious"" descriptions of what is going on); very erratic quality of special effects; pretentious/overblown/self-important attitude tacked onto a storyline that could have been written by an 8 year old. And the music. Oh the music. Really bizarre, often inappropriate to the situation.Poor Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise. They are great actors who probably cringe when they see this come on late night t.v.."
2,Competent boredom,"The movie starts at a barbeque, which really set my interest down quite a few pegs. Then we go to Mars and experience an accident and some impressive sfx. You think that ""well, maybe there is something interesting here after all"". But no, we are quickly transported back to boredom with talk, talk, talk and some astonishingly un-suspenseful suspense. Technical mumbo-jumbo is then turned into new-age mumbo-jumbo as we, together with the wide-eyed crew, experience even more impressive sfx in some supposed ""profound statement"". And isn't it strange that the ones that are killed by this alien force and non-americans. Well, to sum it up, don't waste your money on this. You will do better with ""Event horizon"". Not that it is a good movie, but at least it's fun sci-fi."
1,Worse than Galaxy Quest,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. It has absolutely no character development whatsoever and makes no sense. I love sci/fi movies but this one is not worth the time to even think about.
5,Ciencia ficcion de gran calidad,"Un clasico de Ciencia ficcion, con grandes efectos tanto visuales como de audio, recomendada para toda la familia."
2,Mission to Mars crashes.,"I rated this movie two stars only for the impressive special effects. On a whole, it was quite lame. For example, one could certainly ""feel"" Connie Nielsen's grief as Tim Robbins drifted away, and eventually hastening his own death, but did she shed even one tear, not that I saw. Not very convincing. And the premise that aliens seeded humankind was downright laughable. Glad I spent only $3.00 for a rental. Gee, I wonder what good ol' Star Trek rerun I should have watched instead."
2,This movie just isn't good.,"I'll be brief... I love space stuff, so I had to see this movie. I was very disappointed. You might think it has good acting, but it is surprisingly bad considering the actors involved. There was never much emotion during what would be extremely emotional circumstances. There are also huge technical problems, which make the movie extremely fake. The ending is a bit thought provoking, but it is still weak. What if other Earthlings want to go Home too? Also, I knew the ending was not going to show what Home is like..and it doesn't...which disappointed me."
3,Worth a Look,"Despite the mostly negative reviews, I found this movie to be surprisingly appealing.On one hand, it doesn't have a lot of action, the characters are likable but not well drawn, the dialogue is full of technojargon and occasionally clunky, and the actors give mostly ""Star Trek"" performances (i.e.: little emotion in the face of awesome events).On the other hand, the lack of action was not a detriment. The slower pace enhanced the suspense of some scenes. The technology, while sometimes laid on thick, seemed authentic and was actually interesting at times. The special effects were quite good. I am constantly amazed at the amount of work (and engineering skill) that goes into producing a film like this.Many reviewers have compared the ending of this movie to that of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - vague, pretentious, and weird. Actually, this film has a very straightforward ending which is not hard to understand at all. Don't be put off by the ""lousy ending"" reviews. Judge for yourself."
1,Finally sat down and watched this....,"Granted this is an older movie. But the CGI are horrible even for that period, the science dead wrong even for the data available back then, and the dialogue horrible for any period. Anyone who thought this is some hidden gem needs to spend more time learning science and less time watching lame movies."
4,Better than expected,"I remember when this movie was in the theaters--if you blinked, you missed it. Every review I've read up til now has been extremely negative. Caught the last half or so on TV today. (Actually, have caught the last half at least twice now. Hope to one day see the whole thing, LOL.) Absolutely loved the ending. Thought it much more likely to happen than finding monsters as in ""Prometheus"". (What a disappointment that was.) Yes, this movie does require a little attention and actual THINKING, so I can see why it might not be for everyone. Only complaint I have is with the special effects, which should have been better in this day and age."
2,Who could have approved this screenplay before production?,"I tried my best to enjoy this movie, and to its credit the special effects and cinematography are quite good. However, the dialogue is sophmoric, the characters are written superficially, and the music is terrible. My wife and I began laughing at sections of the film where the characters deliver just plain bad dialogue, or when the music bizarrely rises to a triumphal climax when the characters do mundane actions such as climbing a hill or opening a door. Likewise, the sequencing of scenes with wildly varying emotional tones provides the audience with no sense of continuity (e.g. the bizarre Van Halen dancing scene between 2 other grim scenes)A bare minimum of quality control on the screenplay combined with a new sountrack composer would have gone a long way towards making this an average sci-fi story with a large movie budget."
2,I expected better....,"I have to say I expected better from Brian De Palma and the cast.In all honesty I found this movie to be a bore. Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins,who are usually wonderful,just seem to be going through the motions. They are acting without life. Don Cheadle and Jerry O'Connell,along with the last 20 minutes or so, are the only good things about this film.I give credit to the premise of this story,but the writing and acting fall short."
4,"Great cast, good story, but....","I know that Hogland is happy to see a movie like this on a large screen and I think that the story was cleverly put toghether. It has great special effects, great cast, but.... Unfortunatelly the make up of male actors looks over the top and in certain scenes of the movie you hear this cheese music from a 50s sci-fi (I think it was from War of the Worlds). I think the director wanted to fuse many movies in one. But the blend didn't work as the music sometimes was irritating. Too much make up and cheese music ruins the whole experience. It's a pitty that I give 4 stars. It has lots of potential for 5 stars. I think the director is loosing the touch in making great movies. Overall, it's a great movie."
2,Yawn,"It has the stars, Sinise and Robbins and it has great special effects but Mission to Mars does not have the substance to become a great scifi classic. It has no zing, no intrigue and awe like Krubrick's classic 2001:A Space Odyssey. It has the feel that it was slapped together quickly while there was interest in the Mars face. Don't go out of your way to see the movie, it will be on Fox soon. If you want to see a great Tim Robbins movie check out Arlington Road!"
2,MISSION TO TICKET WINDOW FOR REFUND IS MORE LIKE IT,"Boy was this movie a letdown...here I am waiting for a spring sci fi flick to hold me off til may..thinking..""Hey Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins dont make many bad movies""...after this I realized not everyone is perfect....not much really happens in the movie..this movie should have been called road trip..2020. They spend the whole time getting there. They get there and its a big letdown ending. C'mon..--the tear??!!. This could have been so much more"
2,2001: A Space Travesty,"Brain DePalma's film about an expedition to the red planet is one of the most staggeringly inept pieces of Hollywood flash-trash ever made. There are good points: the SFX is impressive, and Gary Sinise is his usual commanding self, but the whole thing gets totaly ruined by the Close Encounters rip-off ending. It starts off looking like it's gonna be a cool, action-packed sci fi adventure with all the trademark DePlama camera techs, but then we start to get the warning signs that something is very wrong; the cringe-worthy dialouge (""Let's light this candle!""), the ""seen it before"" action heroics and echoes of 2001 played badly. It had such great potential. But this is awful."
1,Is this serious?,"Pathetic, disappointing, and even embarrassing. These are just some of the many negative adjectives that come to mind when critiquing this film. The FX were not bad, but even great computer enhanced images could not make up for an incredibly weak script. I don't know who wrote this painful material, but I believe they are still in grade school. And worse than that, what foolish producer accepted this script as a film-worthy movie anyway? Did he actually think money would be made or an Oscar won with this ""blockbuster""? When I went to see this film in the theatre, I don't think I was ever let down more than when this sorry sack of hot air began rolling. From the beginning interest was quickly lost...The only part even worthy of my interest was the evolution morph at the end of the film. And that part was shown, coincidently, in its entirety on the movie trailer. Do yourself a favor, Do not buy."
3,Didnt like what happens to Tim Robbins Character! Horrible!,"I could have tolerated this ok movie but the way the killed Tim Robbins' character really disturbed me! EHHH, I still have nightmares of the way he looked after he died! It was horrible and really bothered me! In general this movie was boring. I was on a flight from Arizona to Chicago and watched this film on the plane."
1,why de-evolve???,"So...the martians escape to earth in pods and become single-celled organisms? Isn't this like having to go through puberty again - on purpose? How believable is that? I feel sorry for the actors who must have been low on cash to take part in this movie. Very slow, not much plot, definitely not worth the money. Just watch the preview or read the back of the dvd case to find out everything you need to know, then go play cards with your kids. Anyone want my copy for free?"
1,not for me,"The acting is just okay. The special effects are fine. Much of the story-line is unbelievable. For example, when the hurricane force starts-up on Mars, they just stand there and watch it...that's not normal...at least back away. And when the ship was hit by meteors and they saw all the damage, there would have to be other sensors that tell them the fuel tanks have been hit (it's supposed to be 2020; if they can go to Mars, then they have the technology). Although there isn't much swearing, they do take God's name in vain several times, which is completely unnecessary. And the worst was near the end (at which time I turned it off): They teach people that aliens and evolution populated the earth...both are lies. God created all things, and for His pleasure they are and were created. Only God is worthy to receive glory and honor and power. Revelation 4:11.Here is a much better ""Mars"" movie:Red Planet"
2,Not As Bad As You'Ve Heard But Not Great Either,"Mission to Mars offers excellent visuals and a good cast, but the CGI is too cartoonish and the story is weak as well. The characters are too buddy-buddy with each other; I mean when Gary Sinise's character wants to talk about his dead wife all his friends listen and there's just too many scenes of this. All those scenes just slow the movie down. The movie's best scenes are when the astronauts are in their space suits trying to fix the ship; the cast works best in these scenes, especially Tim Robbins. ... it really isn't that bad, the movie may end kind of corny but still I wouldn't give it one star just for that. So in other words, don't be so afraid to rent this movie because it really isn't that bad. I just wouldn't buy it."
3,I liked the movie,"It's not the first time I tried to watch it, but the only time when I actually finished watching it. As a kid I thought the movie was boring, uninteresting. Now I watched it again from the very start to the very end. I do not agree with all of those bad reviews. This movie is not bad.Bad:It is 2 hours long and sometimes it's just too slow;typical NASA equipment failures like in all of the other movies;there had to be deaths and sacrifices.Good:I found it to be entertaining;I thought the ending was good. And just because of that ending it was worth watching."
3,Not Too Bad,"I thought the film was actually thought provoking at times, Gary Sinise and Don Cheadle give pretty good performances. Sure the dialogue was a little corny at times, but Costner had some real cheesy lines in the Untouchables, which was a great film, his ""Lets do some good!"" and when he shoots the thug and yells ""Are you Deaf?"" One cool aspect in this film is ""The Face"" which in reality, was seen from Voyager in 1976. So the writers made a nice tie-in with an actual phenomenon. Anyway I thought the film was ok, and if you watch the extras you'll see all the work that was put in for it."
2,A Standard SF movie...,"This is your standard space travel action movie, filled with the usual cliches, future space technologies and philosophies of the origin / future of mankind. If you like this kind of movie, then this is a good choice, on account of the good cast, and nice special effects (which is why I gave it 2 stars)."
1,It's a Stinker!,"I love sci fi's, even corny sci fi's, but the crappy dialogue and non-stop phony emergency scenarios were just too much. I did manage to get through to the end just to see what the writers had in store for us, the ending was laughable. Don't waste your time, and especially not your money on this one."
3,not bad ....,"but certainly on the order of ""2001 space oddessy"" . definitely a weird movie with too many ""Apollo 13"" moments . border on the fantasy side too much with a similar ""oddessy"" ending . watch a trailer and decide . i'll watch again fer sher , but i wouldnt buy it again ."
1,MISSION TO NOWHERE,"I like SInise and Robbins. As for Tim, I've never particularly watched a film featuring him that I didn't like. Brian de Palma is also a great director. But this movie is a shame to the science-fiction genre. The dialogues are so numb, the plot so stupid. For God's sake, the dancing scene in the ship is annoying, forced to the audience, embarassing. A sad experience."
2,Hmmm... not up to my standards.,"I saw mission to mars in the movies and I must say that I really wanted to like this movie. But exiting the movie it just felt as if I just wasted my money seing it. The movie felt as if it was only half finished and not completed yet. Go buy 2001, 2010 instead or perhaps Contact with Jodie Foster wich is a way better film than mission to mars."
1,My least favorite movie of the year,"I hate this movie. Ever corny plot twist or meladramatic scene possible take place within the course of the excruciating two hours of this film. The characters are obnoxious, the plot boring, and a huge let down of an ending. The only saving grace of this film are the special effects. They look right out of the science fiction magazines of the 1960s which for what its worth is pretty cool."
4,"It's a 50s style nod, not Kuberick","I guess some of the rest of the reviewers just aren't old enough to remember the zeitgeist of sci-fi films of the 50s (not the monster bashes.) This movie is more in line with them, not Kubrick's 2001. While the professional reviewers seemed to think DePalma was ripping them off, I thought it was a satisfying retro. De Palma usually goes for hard action and blood, but not in this film. Kubrick made an ""awe"" movie. This is a ""Gee-Whiz"" space movie, intended, and carried out. Come on people, didn't you feel a little mystery at what was on that thing on Mars? Sure, we knew it would be one of about 3 standard plot devices, but which one! :)And during the film's sad scene (I won't spoil by saying what it was) wasn't that as sad as Ol' Yeller?It's a classic movie about humans striving in space, not an action flick. You might like it."
2,Something Was Missing,"As a lover of science fiction for years, this movie left me a little disappointed. It had the potential to be a spectacular movie, but the lack of imagination from the writer left you with the feeling that something was missing, there should have been more. The talent of the actors was wasted on what could only be called stupid and boring dialogue."
4,Worth reading.,I am always skeptical about reading a fantasy author that is new to me. I'm glad to say that Raven's shadow was worth the effort.
5,Enriching and Enchanting,"Patricia Briggs' writing just gets better and better. In this tale that must be the beginning book of several--please, I hope there's more!, Briggs creates a cast of characters rich and multi dimensional. There's not a wasted word, and I find myself wishing it were 2-3 times longer! The beauty of her characterizations is almost haunting; the way Seraph moves through emotions created by her violent past, her culture, and her role as a mom--every scene she's in is full and interesting, with expected and unexpected comments, feelings, and reactions. Just glorious. And each of the characters is built and related in a similar fashion. Not simple, but unbelievably readable. A book to be read again and again. Thanks, Ms. Briggs!"
4,An enjoyable read...looking forward to the next one!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I think Raven's Shadow is a creative and unique novel and I found it to be very entertaining. My only complaint is that the end seemed to happen too quickly. However, I do believe she is scheduled to write a sequel, which should satisfy my want for more of this story."
4,Engaging and Innovative,"I always look forward to a Briggs novel. Her characters are complex and interesting if not always likeable. She does not depend on romantic formulae when building her plot, even when there is a romance in the offing. The soldier who is tired of war can be a cliche, but add that he also does not want to work in his family bakery and things get interesting. But she doesn't stop with this, she moves 20 years ahead to engage his children in the reaping of a crop that was sewn one night in a town he stopped at on his way home-- a town where a girl saw her brother burned at the stake and found her own life in danger because of the power she held."
3,Decent Story,"If you're looking to pass the time, this is a decent enough read. Good plot, well rounded characters. It lacks the piz-zazz that other series offer (like George R Martin, Vance, Jacqueline Carey, and others) but it is certainly worth the time and money to read this series."
4,It's not the whole story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, until I got to the end. This is apparently the first volume in a multi-book story. The author left a major plot element unresolved at the end. I wouldn't have minded this if the book had had some sort of warning on the cover, such as ""Book 1 of the Shadowed Lands series"". I dropped my rating by a star because of this lack of information.Other than the unresolved plot element, I found this book to be very readable and engrossing. I highly recommend it, though with the caveat that it's not the complete story."
4,Slow Start,"It took half the book for me to really get into it, but it finished well. My intrigued kicked into high gear almost exactly at halfway through the book, then went into overdrive shortly thereafter. I really enjoyed the story, but it pales in comparison to Briggs' Mercy and Anna-Charles books. I'm wondering if it's because the wolf stuff is written in first person, and Raven's Shadow and Hob's Bargain are written in 3rd?Oh well, I'll ponder this as I read another Briggs novel in anticipation of Bone Crossed."
4,A most unusual film,"There were no spoken words, and in this particular film format, no need for words. Translated from the Italian, the title means ""the four times"" - four time frames, or if you prefer to think ""reincarnation,"" four different forms of life - man, animal, plant and mineral. The aging, ill goatherd was the first followed by a lost baby goat, a tall, magnificent tree, and last, a charcoal pit. The filming was in one small village of Italy and its neighboring countryside. The pace was slow, probably depicting the usual life of the small village. The village seemed isolated and provincial. Life goes on; life happens. It was a good film to watch. It does provoke discussion."
3,"If the entire movie were as good as the best segments, it would be magnificent","Some segments are quite engaging and evocative, others; not so much. If the entire movie were as good as the best segments, it would be magnificent. Watch it for the good parts. And who knows? The parts that didn't grab me might be right up your alley."
3,"be in a mood where you're living ""in the Now""! =)","How very funny that I switch from this move to ""Sleeping Furiously"", the Welsh version of this movie!I love foreign movies, and have no problems with subtitles. I watch foreign movies because I love travel. I could live on the road, and have done so.I think I would enjoy this movie more if I was in a Beach-mindset. Unfortunately, I'm more New York state-of-mind right now.Maybe I'll try again someday.As a cultural film it's a great film. Be in a relaxed mood! =)"
1,missed the point,I learned how charcoal is made. Nothing else positive to say. reviewers glowingly used words like sublime...way too sublimey for me. Reviewers raved about humorous scene of dog barking after Easter procession...what's humorous about dog barking? Clearly different strokes for different folks. I wished I had saved my money.
4,Historical Whodunits,"To me historical mysteries are so much more pleasant than contemporary ones. Perhaps it is because the historical ones are not in the least threatening. This book of short mysteries is not only very pleasant to read, but it gave me a list of new authors to look up in the library."
4,Ancient Murder Mysteries,For history buffs this is a well researched book of short stories. Just enough history to make them plausible while being written in modern terms for easy understanding.
3,More horror than whodunit,"Another collection of short historical mysteries, ranging in period from Solomon to the Titanic and featuring well-known HM characters including Catherine Le Vendeur and Sister Fidelma as well as real historical characters such as Herodotus and Benjamin Franklin in created mysteries.Ashley normally does a great job collecting intriguing stories, but I was less than thrilled with this collection. Partially it was that many of the stories were closer to horror than whodunits. Partially it was because many of the stories featured real historical characters, which I dislike. I've liked enough of Ashley's work that I won't quit reading because of this one, but I'm glad this wasn't the first collection of his that I read."
4,Beverly Connor Always A Winner,"I first discovered Beverly Connor's Diane Fallon series, and having read the first book, immediately ordered all the others. After all who can resist a mystery series in which the main protagonist runs a museum, studies bones and leads caving expeditions? Having read all those books, I tried the Lindsay Chamberlain series and was hooked again. Dressed To Die is a well written, taut mystery that grips from the start. Fans of Kathy Reich will love Beverly Connor, who, dare I suggest, does the forensic anthropologist mystery better!"
5,thrilling suspense,"3rd in the Lindsay Chamberlain series, the story begins with Lindsay sniffing through a field looking for a missing art teacher from the university where Lindsay works. Finding the woman is one of Lindsay's few pieces of luck, though, as various household expenses keep adding stress to her finances. On top of that, she's worried about the possible upcoming merger of departments at the university; as a non-tenured faculty member, she could be job hunting soon. In the midst of all this, Lindsay's brother shows up unexpectedly with a truck load of her grandfather's leftover property - crates from a shed in his backyard, a shed of which no one was aware. If Lindsay didn't have enough on her plate, they find a skeleton in one of the crates, and then artifacts are discovered to be missing...and Lindsay seems to be the main suspect."
5,A must have for any FK fan!,I just love this CD. Even if I never watched Forever Knight I would still have enjoyed it. The intercutting of dialog made it fascinating and unique.
4,pretty good CD,This CD is pretty good. I dont much care for the instermental music because its pretty cheesey. I love the singing parts of the CD it is very hypnotic. I wish there was more singing. Since I bought it for just those songs. Those songs make it a good CD.
3,Nice compositions,"Good music, an enjoyable background music. And the added speeches from LaCroix make it worth it."
5,This is just great!,"I have had the CD for about two years and I never tire of it. A fan to the end, and beyond, I am able to hear the show in the woderful music of Fred Mollin. It's perfect in it's portrayl of the main character, Nick. Also, it has the ability to pull at your emotions. Not tug, more like yank. I could be in a quite room listeneing, and suddenly suspence music goes on and I am suddnely on the edge of my seat! The music is great! As for the vocal songs, they are just fantastic. Lori Yates has a beautiful voice and it is just right for the songs that are sung on this soundtrack. The songs themeselves tell us so much about the character without saying a word about him. Their beautiful and they can really move you if you listen. I DEFINATELY suggest to anyone who reads this to buy the CD. Be you fan, or music lover, it's a great investment that you won't get tired of. P.S. There's another one on the way! I suggest you check back soon!"
5,I love Cacas!,"When I received this book as part of a Christmas gift, I had to wonder what the sender was trying to say to me. It was all in fun though. I didn't take the book very seriously at first, but as I read through the pages (after of course just looking at all of the pictures) I realized there was much about caca that I didn't know. The photography is very detailed and it is well-written and informative."
3,The Crow,"A fairly decent film. Brandon Lee's best (and unfortunately last) role. Somewhat predictable and lame acting from the film's heavies, but the dark tone, decent storyline and OUTSTANDING sountrack help us overcome the shortcomings. Watch this film when your girlfriend is feeling sentimental."
5,Brandon Lee's last film and his best,"How can I put it in words, this movie rocks in so many ways I can't tell you. It's got Romance, Drama, Action, the works, Alex Proyas puts you in a comic strip itself. I mean its dark and sexy and Lee and his crow, the crow that leads him kicks bum. Possible Lee's best(examples of others include the OK movie Rapid Fire and the horrible Showdown In Little Tokyo. It kinda sucked how he died and he never got to see its great success, he was shot I think with a blank in the head, and it said that digital movie magic made it so that he appeared in the rest on the movie and there's a special edition tape that has his last interview on it). It's a classic revenge keeper flick"
5,my favorite movie,"This is my favorite movie of all time. kill bill is a complete copy off of it in a way in this he dies n comes back n kills every1 in that she is in accoma for 4 years or sumtn then comes back n kills every1. i love this movie more then anything in teh world its dark its got killing drugs, alocohol, awesome soundtrack and everything.!!!"
4,True Love Never Dies,"I Love this movie. A mystical look at revenge, reincarnation, second chances, and last goodbyes. The soundtrack rocks, BRANDON LEE would have been huge, R.I.P."
5,The best movie ever that was made baby!,"The crow is about Eric Draven a rock musican who was brought back to life by the crow,he is after the people resonable for his and his wife's death.When I saw this movie I wanted to watch this movie forever,you'll love this movie I know it, you'll think that your in heaven,so buy the crow on vhs or dvd!"
4,ALEX&#65533;S CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: Brandon Lee's doomed performance, resonating dread and malice; astounding sets that possibly rank amongst the best in comic book adaptations (except, perhaps, the original Batman and Alex Proyas' later Dark City), non-stop full-throttle energy.Lowpoints: Over-dramatized bits; lack of decent dialogue.Conclusion: The Crow, famous for its protagonist's death during the shoot, is a startlingly uncompromising visual experience that will be cherished by fans of dark comic books, such as Spawn, The Punisher and even Alien. Watch it for its groundbreaking special effects, efficient rock soundtrack and possibly the most agreeably gothic atmosphere ever created in a film.SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: Spawn, Batman I, II, Dark City, Aliens.DON'T SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: Daredevil, Spiderman, or any other PG-13 atrocity out there."
5,Favorite Move of all times,"This has turned out to be my favorite movie of all times. At first glance it seems to be a movie about revenge and violence. It actually turns out to be a love story showing that love transends through time; that real love lasts forever. Brandon Lee IS the Crow, he can never be replaced and he will always be remembered. Rest in Peace Brandon."
3,It's a classic more because everyone parodies it than because it's good,"I bought this film knowing that it was considered a classic from the early 90's film era. However upon viewing it I came to the conclusion that while it is not a bad film per say, it is also more a classic due to the hype that surrounds it, versus it actually being a strong film. If the story and highly stylized way it was presented were not there this would be a rather forgettable movie in my opinion. Decent, but forgettable. The DVD itself was also of rather low quality and looked more like a very good VHS as apposed to a poor DVD. I can't recommend you buy this unless you know you enjoy it, but it is definatley worth renting."
4,A solid 90s era flick that still holds up.,"The Crow is based on a graphic novel (comic book). While it is not the first movie to be based on a this medium, it is one of the first movies to take this material seriously and present it darkly. The Crow is graphic, violent, and presents its story in a dark gothic atmosphere. The film also has a good soundtrack (rock genre). There are moments of silliness in the movie and the plot has some holes, but the movie, as a whole, is entertaining and very watchable. The Crow is not perfect, but its a good flick in a time where movies like it were few and far between. The crow is a trail blazer for films like Sin City, Hell boy, Blade, and Watchman. Its a good little flick and a must have addition to any comic fans film collection."
5,The Crow,I am very pleased with the product. It arrived in a timely manner and was in the condition expected. I would use this supplier again.
4,when two poeple are ment to be nothing can keep them apart,this movie is awesome there will never be a better love story than this movie because thats what i think this movie a love story.This movie is great its dark and romantic at the same time
3,could be worse,With this film I saw something hard and works well but only the first disc the second disc has all the material can be completely reader my DVD drive does not load the game that has no pictures of the story board
4,A Mastepiece of Mood,"The Crow has virtually no plot, but it is so visually interesting and artistically adept that you'll watch it mesmorized. The movie is shot almost entirely at night, and the dark, gloomy photography is intesnse and atmospheric. The story is bleak (eerily enough, the star died during the production) and violent besides, but the movie is a hayride."
5,Just a great series!,I love how they remained faithful to the comics in these movies. Finish the 5th movie Flesh and Blood so I can have at least one more please (not like they can see what I'm typing lol but just in case).
5,Excellent,"The first time I remember walking out of a movie theater being totally impressed was when I saw the theatrical release of The Crow. I bought it as soon as it came out on video, have watched it a number of times since then and still am not tired of it. This is a dark, elegant, violent, hopeful and above all excellent film that I wish would not be marred by the death of Brandon Lee. It is not for everyone, but I definitely think everyone of age should at least give it a chance."
5,Top Ten Movie Ever,"This is my third copy of this movie. I purchaced it on VHS originally, then on DVD. My roommate let her brother ""borrow"" it and I never saw it again! Can't stand NOT having this movie. I don't watch it all that often but I rank it in my top ten favorites so I have to have it."
5,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,I recomend that everyone see's this movie although you will probly need to watch it twice to fully understand the power of it. This is Brandon Lee's best performence. Everyone should see this movie..... mike
5,GREAT BASED-ON -COMIC BOOK MOVIE,"Alex Proyas does SUPERB job directing this very dark adventure film. This film NOT ONLY spawned a sequel BUT ALSO the hit TV series. Brandon Lee (son of martial arts superstar and legend Bruce Lee), plays rock musician ""ERIC DRAVEN"" who after a year of his death, rises from the grave to extract revenge on the inner city hoodlums who murdered him and his fiance. It is A REAL SHAME that this film will ALWAYS be remembered NOT for its story content and GREAT PLOT, but as the last film Brandon Lee made in his very short life. Lee was ACCIDENTALLY shot to death during the making of the film, when a mystery man exchanged the dummy rounds in a gun with live ammunition."
2,lacking translation,"I'll keep this short. A previoulsy viewed video copy is better than this dvd. First off there are absoultely no extras what-so-ever. The laserdisc I have of this film is in THX, and has a interview with Brandon Lee at the end of it. This dvd is in dolby digital, just like that laserdisc, but is missing all of the other cool things. Sorry, but this dvd was a rush job, it is obvious that Disney/Miramax just wanted to get the film out on dvd without putting any real effort into the translation. The picture is far too dark at times and the sound is not as punched up as the laserdisc. This would have been a great dvd if the effort to make it so was there."
5,the crow,My austic son never gets tired of watching the crow I recommend this movie highly its an older movie it has a lot of action
3,Amazing film!!! Terrible packaging by company,"This movie is simply amazing and shows the true potential of Brandon Lee in his final film. The movie itself deserves 5 stars, but when I received the package, the disc was loose. The carelessness of the company cost them the potential 5 stars the movie itself deserves."
3,no title,"Very dark, very violent, stylized film, somewhat on the order of ""Batman"", but no lightness anywhere. Premise is dead man comes back to life to avenge lover's death. Blood and gore and shootings run rampant. Brandon Lee was good - kind've reminded me of Johnny Depp. And the head bad guy was very good, with a marvelously raspy bass voice. But after having seen within a few days ""Natural Born Killers"", a rescreening of ""Robocop"" and now this, I cannot help but be struck by our society's penchant for being entertained by gore and bloody violence, in many cases quite sick. I see no difference between this movie gore and the Roman gladiators performing for the populace. Sure, in the arena men died, and all on the screen is make-believe, but the visuals are the same. We are impacted with the same sights and sounds, perhaps worse. Why do human beings find this entertaining? This is not new either; people used to love boxing, seeing a boxer's face get smashed to pulp. Because it's not them?"
4,Really Cool Movie,I have'nt seenthis movie for a long time but it was just as good as I remember it.
5,The Crow,"It is such a shame that this was Brandon Lee's last film. He played his role perfectly! And the best time to watch this movie is at midnight with all the lights out. The movie is not only dark with it's lighting (which is how it should be) but the theme is also dark. Very enjoyable, and eerie, and bring your teddy bear!"
4,Recovering a sense of loss,"Can't help but watch this with sadness at what-might-have-been: with ""RapidFire"", Brandon showed that his martial arts chops could rival his father's; with ""The Crow"", he clearly demonstrates that his acting chops would have far exceeded Bruce Lee's. He had all of that physical quality of acting that, since Bruce's passing, has only been occasionally shown by Jet Li and Donnie Yen, but neither of them has really measured up to the potenial that Brandon demonstrates in ""The Crow"". This film isn't quite enough of an epitaph, but it's all we've got."
3,Quality Ratings (Sound / Video),"Such a disappointment. I have both the VHS and DVD versions of this film and I am saddened about the quality.The picture quality (just as WideScreen Review rated it) is poor. Not to make excuses but it may have something to do with Brandon Lee being grafted into the movie after his death.The movie is (IMHO) supposed to be dark and murky, however, on the DVD, blacks are grey and murky is smokey. Faces are definately not crisp as one would expect by paying about $20.00.Sound is a little better, as good as it can get with little need for 5.1 speakers. As most of the film is dialog, there is hardly a need to even turn on your subwoofer."
1,Amazon Advertised Wrong,As many others have stated Amazon advertised selling this with a digital copy yet there was no digital copy. They have since ceased offering this item as they know they screwed everybody. A credit had better be in everyones account that didn't receive the item as was advertised.
5,VERY GOOD,I think these guys are good at what they do not only was it cheaper than the rest it was also brand new..And the shipping was at a fair price and it arrived in great timeing I am really looking forward to doing bussiness with these guys again Thank You MovieMars I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR
5,Goth/Horror/Romance/Action/Thriller/....,"I really can't praise this movie enough. It is just the ideal movie. It was so pure and it really took you to a higher level thjat most movies just can't. Even though it is considered a ""goth"" classic, people of any type will love this. It is a classic story about revenge and love and really puts your small problems into perspective. It made me think."
5,the crow blu ray image quality.,I recently watched the blu ray and the picture quality is a big improvement over the standard dvd. This movie has alot of dark and night scenes but it looks very very good. I saw very minimal film grain in a few scenes but nothing to worry about. The 5.1 dts sound was also sweet. I've waited a long time for this movie on blu ray and It was worth it.
3,"Awesome movie, horrible quality DVD","I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theaters. Owned the VHS for years and figured it was time to upgrade to DVD. That turned out to be pointless, I could've dubbed my VHS to DVD myself. I could've let my 3 yr old niece dub it from VHS and she couldn't have done worse. There is some sort of strange grid pattern throughout the movie and tons of noise in the picture. Reminds me of watching my family's old 8mm home movies. Seems a common complaint among anyone who seems to comment on picture quality. Aren't a lot of options out there, but know what you're getting."
5,Great Title for your PSP,"A great movie for your PSP collection. Good title menu and controls, and adapts very well to the PSP. Highly recommend adding this great movie to your collection."
4,The Crow,"For the first time a crystal clear version of this cult classic. It wasn't a great film, the plot isn't the greatest, but because it was Brandon's final film it has sentimental value to me."
5,Absolutely awesome. Even watching it in B/W was so gothic !,"This film was just like watching it at the movies, however better sound! Very thrilling. Definately an asset to buy this one."
5,"Caw, Caw.","The Crow definately paints a dark picture of inner-city life in the make believe world created by Alex Proyas. This movie is not a cult classic because of the untimely death of Brandon Lee and the sentiment surrounding it. It is a classic film because it possesses all of the elements that are needed to make a great movie. What i enjoy most about this film is the way it always remains dark and rainy, casting a gloomy mood throughout the film. The city in which it takes place is a seedy, grungy underground world where evil lurks around every corner. Fortunately The Crow is there to protect us from that evil as he sets things straight and makes things right.Brandon Lee plays his character so lovingly, and it is a shame what happened. God bless his kind soul."
5,"THE CROW IS CORN-Y, NOT!","THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE JESUS JOKE BRANDON TELLS, IT'S A PERFECT, I MEAN A PERFECT MOVIE. SUSPENSE, SATISFACTION, AND ACTION. ALEX PROYAS DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB."
2,No audio,"This is a late review. I brought this movie sometime in the early year of 2012 and somewhere in Sept I opened the DVD, popped into my PS3, and it would not work. All my other DVDs worked with my PS3 except this one. Next, I tried it on my PC. The movie was playing but there was no audio and I was force to install something and whatever it was did not do anything. I contacted Amazon thinking, they probably aren't going to give my money back. Sad face. BUT! I got a full refund back and they said to keep the movie and do whatever I want with it. Now it's on my list of things I want to sell. Heh."
4,FOUR STARS,"EVEN THOUGH VENGEANCE TYPICALLY DOESN'T BELONG TO US, I CHEERED FOR THE CROW TAKING KARMA INTO HIS OWN HANDS AND ""MAKING IT RIGHT"" SO HE AND HIS LOVE COULD REST IN ETERNAL PEACE TOGETHER."
5,Oldie but Goldie,Soundtrack still rocks after all these years!!!! The story is a strong argument for 'eye for an eye' justice. Very cool all the way around.
5,I love Ron Roy children mysteries,"I am Ayush Mohanty, the #1 fan of your books. I love your mysteries because it is adventurous and has suspense."
3,A pornographic gothic novel....,"Farmer had two mixed genre pornographic novels that I'm aware of. ""A Feast Unknown"" pitted Doc Savage against Tarzan in a mildly pornographic fight to the death. ""Image of the Beast,"" with its title from the Book of Revelation, is a nicely pornographic gothic novel with an interweaving of bad science-fiction overtones. ""Blown,"" the sequel, rather ruins the effect of the main novel, actually. Farmer's imagination ruins his art in the sequel. I've known several people who found the more sadistic scenes in ""Image"" to be arousing."
2,An Experimental Work!,"I tried listening to it several times but could not ""find a handle on it"". Perhaps more adventurous listeners can understand his interpretation of the chosen music."
3,Not the best of Epictetus,"I really love the philosophy of Epictetus and this book is no exception. However I found this work to be a little difficult to grasp. The ideas expressed were at times rather complex.I much prefer a different work, A Manual for Living. I have written a review on that book and I found it much easier to understand. The ideas were much clearer. I strongly recommend A Manual for Living as a much better example of the work of Epictetus.I suggest you read my other review before you buy this book."
2,enchiridion,"I Didn't know what to expect with this volume, but this edition was a little too bare bones. A little more back ground and insight would have been better.I realize this was a least expensive book and I probably got what I paidfor Thrift Edition more or less says it all."
2,TERRIBLE translation,"This edition by Long (one of the worst translators of ancient texts) is rendered in clumsy, graceless, sometimes bewildering English. Go for the Everyman edition with translation by Robin Hard. If I ever get the time, I may put this in contemporary English myself. It would be difficult to do worse than the editions out there now."
3,Good book; Typos: not so much,"There are enough reviews on how this is a good book, and a pretty darn good overview of stoic philosophy. I just wanted to throw in my two cents over the fact that the kindle edition has numerous typos in it. It's not a huge deal, but for being a copyright-free book that I still had to pay for to get in an ebook version, it'd be nice if had been proofread..."
4,Timeless Guide to Conduct,"This 2,000-year- old self-help book is as relevant today as when Epictetus (slave turned philosopher) wrote it. The Enchiridion is a simple and pragmatic guide to Stoic conduct.When someone speaks ill of you, rather than defend yourself (thereby giving legitimacy to the insult), reply, ""...The man did not know the rest of my faults, for he would not have mentioned these only.""This is a book about conduct, dignity, and moderation. ""Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the things...""When dealing with people who need to inflate themselves at the expense of others: ""I am richer than you, therefore I am better than you; I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better than you...But you are neither possessions nor speech.""This is a very short read, but worth rereading from time-to-time."
3,Not what it could be.,"For a book titled The Complete Works, this book visually falls short. Many of the pictures are smaller and in black and white - not providing enough photos to be a really valuable visual research tool."
4,"Not bad, but you do have to work at it.","Although the book is a little bit more spiritual than I care for, the techniques do work. While you will need to put the time and effort in to complete the exercises I think most men will find the reward is worth it."
1,Danger: The finger lock can trigger tuberculosis on the epididymis,"Even though the finger lock described within this book is very effective, I don't recommend anyone to practice any technique contrarian to the natural course of things like the finger lock described within this book. If you are a perfectly healthy man then there should NOT be any problem. But if you have already got tuberculosis in the past or other bacterial disease then by stopping yourself from ejaculating you are forcing the bacteria from urine to the epididymis which has almost NO blood circulation and consequently NO defence. So if you get a harmless infection on your epididymis after practicing the finger lock, go straight to see your urologist and ask him about genital tuberculosis or syphilis infection. The lesson is: don't reverse any natural functionality of your body because it can trigger unplanned disease! Live a happy life with what you already have. Good bless!"
1,buyer beware,"not sure what to say except, i learned some intresting stuff.when practiced i felt diffrent, i felt my body buzzing. But then it got wierd, whether pychosamatic or not i felt weird around other people as if i could feel them. crazy huh?whenever i tried to explain to people that i felt energy, they thought i was crazy. this is wierd stuff just be prepared to sound like new age phony. in order to prolong arousal you change the flow of Chi, by doing this you become sensitive to other enegry around you, It is like turning on a new sense, which could not be turned off, or at least i couldn't find in the book how to.I would be very cautious, if your not into new age and are normal, this sounds like the perfect sort cut, beware and be careful, as far as did it work?....sorta i abonded it after i felt like it was putting my sanity into question, maybe it was real or in my head?"
1,I suffered from hot flashes! 2 pages with other side effects,"I tried the techniques and especially the most important one the ""Big Draw"". Unfortunately, I suffered from hot flashes for about 30 minutes. This is only one of the side effects from several ones you may experience as a result from following these techniques. Mantak Chia is well aware of them and they are listed on 2 pages! I didn't know that they are potentially dangerous. The techniques are NOT explained in details and as you see the result can be painful and harmful instead of pleasurable. Actually, the moment I start feeling good I have to stop and calm down. I doubt that anyone will enjoy even 1 orgasm with this approach."
5,Much easier that Mantak Chia's other book,"This book condenses much of ""Cultivating Male Sexulity"". It is easier to read and to interpret. This book is suited for the average man. The techniques require work and self disipline, so do not expect instant results."
2,My energy field is flacid,Ejaculation can be delayed by tugging on the testicals or pressing behind the scrotum. The rest is new age hooey about energy fields.
5,It's a must!,The book describes and maintains a perfect environment and approach for real life results. Perfection lies ahead!
1,"shrill, faux-outraged blather:","This book (in fact, everything I have ever read by Doucet) is purely one note. A dire, angry attack on the stereotypes she has formed about men (not to mention those she applies to the cliches she claims to have been involved with), this particular story goes on to prove more of the opposite-sided although far-more-eloquent bigotry of Dave Sim in his anti-woman rants in Cerebus than anything the idea of misogyny could hope to presume. Julie Doucet proves herself to have a purely emotional agenda that lacks even the basic notion of rationality and proves just how stupid single-minded and self-righteous intellectuals are capable of being.Good for the laughs at taking things the wrong way and other forms of profound misunderstanding of human motivations. Absolute trash on the gutter point spectrum of the industry."
1,Let's Not Forget,"While Rich's book may be a somewhat useful book of reviews he created for the New York Times, it must be remembered how he nearly ruined Broadway by writing hostile reviews of shows written by creative people he didn't like and glowing reviews for his personal favorites. He and his soon to be wife (Alex Witchel) who wrote the Friday Broadway column in times gave new meaning to the words ""conflict of interest"" and nearly destroyed Broadway in the process."
1,Buy Standard Deviants,Refer the same title in Standard Deviants in AlgebraTeaching Systems and Standard deviants are one and the sameStandard deviants prices are cheaper
5,best album I own,"I purchased this album after reading Chaz Bono's Transition book. I have never been so impressed on the talent he had. He sounded like a young, smooth version of his mother Cher. If want a great album with each song as good as the one before it, buy this album. To me it sounds like a female version of ELO and the Beatles."
4,Get The Ride You Want With Progressive 416-1608A Air Shocks,"Suspension is the most important part of anything you ride on or in.Everyone LOVES Comfort while riding or driving ETC.To get that you need the BEST SHOCK around.Which is Progressive,and to maintain that comfort while adding weight to your ride you have to have Progressive Air Shocks.I have been riding for 37yrs. I have tride all kinds of shocks & even big named brand ones,but I never had as good as ride until i got the 416-1608A Progressive Air Shocks.THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT IS NEEDED FOR THE LOOK OF IT YOU NEED TO OFFER A CHROME COVER FOR THE BOTTOM 1/2 OF the shock [LIKE I MADE]Show Quality is very important.After that is done watch your sales grow on the AIR SHOCK"
4,"Churchill, Quotes","A good review and background of famous quotes of Churchill. It also showed him to be a good husband and sober man, despite the rumor otherwise."
2,There are better compilations of Churchill's wit.,As a inexpensive brief introduction to Churchill wit this is OK. But volumes have been published collecting almost every statement Churchill every made which are far far superior.
3,O.k. read,"This is not a laugh a minute book, as the name implies. Only some of the quotes are wickedly funny-and those are the ones you already know. This book is o.k. for a beach read."
2,flavor minus ingredients,a good cover and that is about it . many misquotesand non attributed quotes . mistakes too.
1,The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill,"Thanks for the opportunity to review this book. However, as it has not yet been delivered, (order placed on 1 June 2011, it would be difficult for me to comment at this time other than to say that this is the first time I have encountered any sort of problem ordering via Amazon, be it in the UK, The USofA or France where I shop regularly.It is interesting that if you give an item 0 stars, it won't accept the review. Perhaps Amazon needs to review the reviewing process."
4,An Excellent Picture of the Wit of Sir Winston Churchill,"I am a long-time admirer of Sir Winston Churchill. As a leader he had few (if any) equals, but I have always been impressed with his sharp wit and stinging retorts. One can learn much about the man from what is found in this little book, not only from the quotes attributed to him, but also from those zingers hurled his way by friend and foe alike.This book is an easy read. It can be picked up for a few moments' pleasure without distracting from the greatness that is Sir Winston Churchill."
5,Sir winston Churchill,"Sir Winston. One of the great heros of our country. This book should be read by all school children, why are they reading shakespear when we have the ultimate hero.A master of politics and war. Sir Winston will always be my hero. This book will give you a super account of the mans life."
1,Weakest of all the Churchill witicism books,"Lovely cover as noted by another reviewer, but I concur, that's about it. I've read all the Churchill witticism books on the market and this was by far the weakest. Rather than just simple wicked wit, the book is laden with British Colloquialisms and history that will be utterly lost on the American reader. There is also a smattering of (oddly) untranslated French quotations which require a trip to the internet in order to understand. There are a couple of laugh out loud anecdotes but overall, too many short historical stories which provide (too much) background, are rather bland and cause Churchill's wit to be nearly lost in the process. An OK book but nothing more. If you're a Churchill completist, buy it for the few stories that aren't in the other wit and wisdom books. Otherwise, save your money."
5,Everything I Always Wanted to Know About Mushrooms,"This was part of a birthday gift to my son-in-law. It was recommended by someone at the Olympia, WA Farmer's Market, admired by the relative, and sent by me. He is as happy as a clam....make that ""mushroom,"" because her also got starter Shitakes from his wife. He looves the book. And I love shitakes."
5,Excellent!,Excellent book on the role of fungi in the ecosystem. The role Fungi in ecosystem decomposition and functioning are often overlooked and/or ignored. It very refreshing to see a scientist actually successfully connect science and real life so that it enables all people to become active in making a difference in their own worlds.
4,Mycelium Running,I was introduced to this book through a magazine article. Didn't know what to expect and it does read like a science text but the author is truly passionate and inventive when it comes to mycelium.
3,Greate sound at a low price,"This product blends a great singer (Ms. Knight), terrific arrangements and high quality remastering. In fact, the songs are not equally lovely. But ""Neither One of US"" and ""Once in my Life"" alone make it worthy."
1,Dull production,"I find this production completely faceless and at the end boring. One only has to wonder how, after the cinema has been in existence for around 100 years and capable of producing real works of art and at least some good entertaining films, there are films done now being so stillborn. It does not entice any feelings, as far as I can judge, and may be good only to while away the time. It's certainly more beneficial for an individual to invest that leisure time into reading the book, that way it can be understood why it had become famous. If Great Gatsby were represented only by this picture, no one would care for it after couple of months following its release in movie theaters. This one will collect the dust in movie rental stores in the near future, I am convinced..."
4,Winning features are the Fitzgerald bio and his narrative text in movie,"Pros and cons of the 2000 (UK, 2001 US) A&E; version of The Great Gatsby have been extensively discussed. Suffice it to say, I value it because, unlike the 1974 movie, the 2000 one has Nick extensively voicing Fitzgerald's (1896-1940) beautiful prose.However, the real winner on the 2000 Gatsby DVD is the extra, namely, the A&E; biography: F. Scott Fitzgerald: The Great American Dreamer (1997). Narrated by Edward Herrmann, it is in 4:3 aspect and has a TT0:44:35. This A&E; bio was previously available separately for $25 list but is now out of print."
2,He's no Robert Redford,"After reading the novel The Great Gatsby for school I went out and rented the 1974 version of the movie. I absolutely adored it. It showed the characters personalities as they were in the book. After that we watched the 2001 version in school and I found it to be almost unbearable. The acting was poor exspecially on the part of Toby Stephens (Gatsby). He seemed like more of a mix of Joey from friends and Boy George than a love struck man. While the hit and run scene did prove to be rather entertaining, over all I feel that this movie is just a waste of time and you would be much better off watching the 1974 version."
2,Gatsby: Good not great,This film was beautiful to watch but I must say I was not impressed with the story; Toby Stephens and Mira Sorvino are excellent actors but I was not satisfied with how this was pieced together. I would rent this -- not buy it.
1,Stop where you are! Do NOT watch this movie!!!!,"Where to begin?! I had such hope due to the cast, but, oh my. The stiff dialogue, the completely invented storylines (I kept imagining the writer saying ""ok, the book is a masterpiece, but wait till they get a load of what I can do with it....."") The horrible cheap and ugly costumes, and the cufflinks, my heavens, the cufflinks.About 20 minutes in, my high school students held a revolt and begged me to turn it off lest it permanently taint their enjoyment of Fitzgerald's work. I think Brandon said it best, ""it's like bad Titanic meets a flapper Soap Opera...no, a Spanish TV flapper Soap Opera.""Horrible, horrible, horrible. The only redeeming quality is that any student who watches this mess instead of reading the book will fail any and all quizzes. Stick to Francis Ford Coppala's 1974 version with Redford and Farrow. Nelson Riddle music, Ralph Lauren costumes, Cartier jewelry and an acurate plotline...that's more like it."
2,Dull,"Almost none of the glamor of the Jazz Age is captured in this lukewarm adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Miro Sorvino is a fine actress, but she's terribly miscast as Daisy Fay Buchanan in this mediocre offering from A&E. The Redford/Farrow version is superior by far."
3,This is for you Mr. M!,"I think both characters did a fine job of portaying who they were supposed to be based on the book. However, I did not feel as in-tune with the characters as I did when reading the book. It seemed as though all the depth in the characters was left out in an effort to get their lines recited. Although Daisy does a good job of portraying the ditzy girl who just wants to be supported by a money-making man, I did not feel emotionally connected with her at all. Gatsby's characteristics did shine through his character, but the acting job was not well done at all. Toby Stephens looked a little out of place and uncomfortable with that character.In following the general plot, the movie was fairly accurate, but when it came down to detail, I think the movie left out a lot. But, the picture was well done and the accuracy of plot, cotumes, sound, etc. was good. I enjoyed the movie although it was not the best depiction of the book!"
1,Stinko Production,"Hard to believe Fitzgerald could be so badly done. The talented Mira Sorvino is miscast. Hairstyles are modernized right out of the period in which this story takes place. Robert Evans' production with Redfield/Farrow was much superior. He was able to mostly stick to the original dialogue and that production had an other-worldly look about it that this new one lacks. In short, it really stinks."
3,"Brooding, dark....","A brooding, dark film which is semi-autobiographical on the lives and times of the Fitzgeralds. F. Scott and Zelda both personified the ""roaring twenties"" excesses and sexual liberation of the times. All of which came crashing down with the collapse of the stock market and the events brewing in Europe. A winsome look back to the life and times."
3,Not too bad,"It's an alright movie, and if you feel like giving it a try I would certainly say 'go ahead'. However the book is much better."
3,full rounded rendition,"This is a fully rounded rendition of Fitzgerald's book: scenery, content, background, costumes, vehicles, dialogue, etc. It even put African-Americans as mentioned in the book. Though this version is more complete than the 1974 version, I felt that the cast of the '74 version did a better interpretation. The cast in the 2001 version did not go deep in character presentation. It felt too superficial to me. However, I did admire the vehicles used in both versions!"
3,Hey Mr. M,"... While the movie version does not do the book justice (as almost no movie versions can), it was made enjoyable by a few key factors. Paul Rudd as Nick was fabulous. He manages to capture the character perfectly with his attitude towards Gatsby and Daisy, and does a wonderful job narrating. The addition of direct quotes added to his performance and my enjoyment of the movie. The soundtrack was almost perfect, bringing you right into each scene. The costumes were also wonderful, although I got the impression that Gatsby's weren't flashy enough. Gatsby himself, played by Toby Stephens, was a disappointment. His smile was more eerie than reassuring, and the phrase ""old sport"" didn't so much as roll off his tongue as fall ungracefully to the floor. If you are a huge fan of Fitzgerald's book, I don't suggest seeing this movie. But if it was only a book you somewhat enjoyed, go rent this movie, if only to see Paul Rudd's performance,..."
5,A great read!,"A visual treat for armchair travelers, this book takes you on the exciting and sometimes frustrating search for the answer to the Amelia Earhart question. Thoroughly researched and well edited, the story does not slow down for the facts. Highly recommeded."
5,America's First Lady of the Air,"An easy read, this book gives a detailed overview of attempts to proove a likely theory of Amelia Earhart's disappearance during her attempt to fly around the world."
5,Amelia Earhart's Shoes,I was very pleased with the speed in which was sent to me and the condition was excellent. Everything was way above average.
4,"A cozy, warm read that challenges one's views of domesticity","This selection of short stories provides a cozy, warm read. These are perfect for reading in the middle of winter, under a blanket, while drinking a great cup of tea. Colwin's stories revolve around love and domesticity, but they also focus on tensions within that realm. A good read."
2,Orange Sound Is Very Sour,"All i can say is, as 7M3 fan i was very dissappointed with their third effort. Orange Ave. sounds too much like the band went a totally different direction then the previous albums. I understand bands need to grow and expand but come on! This album along with their new look is just to Pop. Songs like Peel and Hang On just plane suck! However, i do like the mid 70's sound of SouthWestern State and of course Over The Shoulder has good original 7 sound. Again, i was dissappointed in this album but, that won't change my mind about the talent of this band. I have faith that 7 will go back to their sound. The sound they started with. American Standard and their BEST ever Rock Crown."
2,"Get ""Rock Crown"" Instead","I agree with many others that this album lacks the emotion and honesty of ""Rock Crown."" There are no songs on this disc that seem as real emotionally as ""Lucky"" from their previous album. What this band tried to do is gain more commercial and radio support with radio friendly tunes such as the totally Matchbox 20ish ""Over Your Shoulder."" Yes, this song is nice on the ears initially, but it is not the Seven Mary Three that I believe most true fans want to hear."
1,Skip it,"Orange Ave. sounds a lot like a country music album. 7M3 is miles away from ""American Standard"", in my opinion their only good album. What's the matter guys? Did you leave your distortion pedals at home?"
2,7m3 Rushed this one into the stores.. it shows,"7m3 recorded this album while on tour, put it out almost exactly one year after RockCrown, and went belly up in the process. This album is pitiful compared to the other two. It wouldn't be a bad album for just any other old band but for 7m3, it's a crying shame. One guy nailed my thoughts exactly by saying their change in styles was absurd. This album sounds like they should be in a Country category. You boys let me, and the remaining few 7m3 fans down with this one. Update your web site!"
3,buy Rock Crown first,yeah theyre are a few excellent songs on this album. and not many if any bad songs. but much of it lacks passion. rock crown is the album you want first.
3,"buy if you want to pay $13 for ""over you shoulder""","I wan't to impressed with this CD, unlike everyone else seems to be. Sure ""Over your Shoulder"" is a great song, but the rest was nothing cool. Songs like Joliet and Super-related were ok, but The album as a whole didn't seem to acomplish anything like their previous two. I just got this CD today so maybe it will grow on me, but its obviously no masterpeice."
2,Better than horrific....,"Orange Ave. is better than horrific, but less than bad, if you catch my drift. :) This album is an awkward, dis-jointed record from beginning to end. From what was written about the album by Jason Ross, there was a lot of turmoil in the band during the recording, and as a result, they put out a pretty bad stinker. With that said, I gave it 2 stars because there are actually a few good songs, ""Hang On"" is my favorite song on the CD. ""Flagship Eleanor"" is also good, and ""Peel"" is a very good song. I wasn't big on the first and only release ""Over Your Shoulder"", and never will be. All in all, I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5, but certainly not 3, so I'll stick with 2."
5,A SOLID DEBUT,"Wow, am I really only the second to review this awesome debut from the Clay People? This is just as good as the self titled album, but a lot different sounding. Firetribe sounds darker, and more industrial. A solid debut, and it's a shame that more people don't know about them. This album is hard to find though, and I had to get it special ordered from my local music store back then. But thanks to the internet these days you can order it now! My favorite tracks on here are, ""Crudsong,"" ""Nothing,"" ""Void,"" and ""Teeth to Grind."" Hell, the whole thing is good!"
1,Used to take this but switched to Maxivision,I have been taking this for a long time but my eye doctor at UCLA changed me to Maxivision. Its been getting rave reviews and my mother who has had AMD for 3 years now has had her vision stable since she has been taking Maxivision. I think its a better formula.
5,eye health,Recommended by my eye doctor to preserve the small amount of sight I have left. I like this product because I only have to take 1 capsule 2 times a day instead of 4 tablets. The capsules slide down easy also..
1,Bausch and Lomb PreserVision AREDS Eye Vitamins,"When I read the daily doses on the box, I decided that I was not going to take these pills:Vit A 572% DV; Vit C 745% DV; Vit E 1334% DV; Zinc 464% DV; Copper 80% DV. This was way overdosing except for the copper. I already have a healthful diet which gives me some of the vitamins and minerals included in this medicine and take lutein/zeaxanthin for my eyes."
2,Eye Vitamins,"My husband ordered these on the advice of his eye doctor -- saw no change, one way or the other, so stopped taking them."
3,Another comic come to life,"As comics adaptations go, this one is prety good. It's a supernatural revenge story. The hero is wronged and wrongly killed, but that doesn't stop him from his avenging justice, seeking out the mysterious man with the mysterious scars.The movie, as a whole, has a neo-noir feel about it. It's about bad cops, sleazy strip joints, and dark alleys. The fights aren't cleaned up, or not much - wounds really bleed. The female lead seems almost out of place, as if she's some emissary from a world of wholesome daylight.This is watchable action/adventure, a little more raw than most. Don't look for complex characters or ideas, though. It's still just a comic book, or what the comic would be without the ""Comics Code."""
3,Remains a good story,"Although not as good as the original Crow which was a classic, Kirsten Dunst gives an apt performance. She is not as insipid as she was in Superman"
1,Far worst than you can imagine,"I am a HUGE fan of The Crow series. I loved the first one starring Brandon Lee. The second fell alittle behind, but it was still worthy of the Crow name. This one on the other hand actually made me feel ashamed that I even rented it. I wanted to turn it off and throw it out the window. I watched it just cause I loved the others. But this one is not worth checking out. The acting is terrible, the directing is bad, and the chemistry between the characters was not their. The feel of the whole movie was just bad."
1,Salvation was the worst crow movie of all,I have seen all of the crow movies and this is the worst one . I cant believe how much this movie [disappointed] .If you have children please do not let them see this movie because it shows women posing for online pornography and shows a dirty cop looking up a young womans skirt.
4,Must see for Crow Fans!,"After hearing that this movie was a flop during a short showing in WA, I was expecting this movie to be another bust or as whack as The Crow: City of Angels. All the action, dialogue, and music seemed to flow very well in the movie and Eric Mabius does a way better job playing the crow than Vincent Perez. The reason why I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because the first one was best out of all the Crow movies put together. So if you liked the first one, but hated the last one, you will probably like Salvation. I hope the next Crow movie is as good or better than Salvation. Rumor has it that rappers DMX and possibly Eminem MIGHT be in it."
1,this movie made me vomit in stupidness,why in god's name would anyoone want to make this movie. he blowsup a helicopter in the movie. the stabs people. i hate violence.read the bible everyday. This movie was a waste of my time here on earth. I will come back to life like the crow and destroy the people who made this movie
2,Last in line.,"There have been four Crow movies, a TV series and numerous comic series and of all there have been, this rates at the bottom of the pile. It almost felt like whoever put this thing together wanted to break away from the elements that made the Crow, in both movies and comics, work.The murder mystery wasn't very mysterious, it's always nice to see Kirsten Dunst doing work, but I wondered why she was even there. The love story was based on her dead sister, so what? Another love interest? It didn't play well. The Crow, a normally trench coated avenger wore a trnchcoat in this for all of five minutes, and the educated evil police force was a serious stretch.All in all, I watched it because it was a Crow movie, a comic movie and hey, it had Kirsten Dunst, but it was far from something I'd spend serious time watching again though I do own it. Whenever I need some background noise and want something to grab my attention only at certain times, this works if there's nothing else available."
4,It should have been on the big screen,"The Crow: Salvation was a good movie. What most people don't realize is that in each story, The Crow brings back someone different to deal with their own problems and sometimes those of people around them. It isn't supposed to be a carbon copy story. This movie told the tale well. It is a definite must get for die hard fans of O'barr's story! I hope that the film company doesn't impede further efforts to the big screen."
5,The Best Of The Crow Sequels,"When giving this movie 5 stars, I am comparing it with the other Crow Sequels. If I could give the original Crow 10 stars, I would. I think Salvation is better than City of Angels and Wicked Prayer. Don't think this movie sucks just because it went straight to video. A must see for any Crow fan."
3,SECOND TIME LUCKY,"It was never going to be easy topping the success of the first Crow movie, which had just about everything you could ask of a faithful adaptation. There was no excuse for The Crow: City Of Angels to be so dire, so I held little hope for a third movie being any better. Thankfully, with The Crow: Salvation am I proved very, very wrong. The story is easy to follow, with some thought going into it, the acting was strong enough and the visuals were stunning, especially the death chamber. The biggest surprise of this movie was that not only had the producers and director managed to stay faithful to the gothic of the first, but also added humour, which is something I never expected to find in a Crow movie, but something that works well here. Hopefully, this movie is an indication of sequels to come, where action and drama go hand in hand, rather than the spectacular mess that was City Of Angels. An ideal movie for a quiet Friday night that is well worth a look."
3,better than the lame sequel,"I'd say this one it better then 1996's City Of Angels which really downfalled it with Vincent Perez's crappy dialouge and mindnumbing prancing around, but I think Eric Mabius is better then him and does a great job in the lead role. who cares if its the same story over again, at least Perez didnt do this one is all I said and I think Kirsten Dunst if good in this one too but then she sorta trips a wire and goes nowhere somewhere int the movie. Mabius cant live up to the performance of Brandon Lee but Mabius is a sure fine actor(dispite his lame supporting roles in Cruel Intentions and Resident Evil). for fans"
2,"Well, at least it's better than City of Angels","After being wowed with the first Crow film, and totally disappointed with the second installment, City of Angels, I honestly didn't expect much from this direct to video release and third entry in the Crow series. While it is better than the second installment, its not by much. Eric Mabius isn't half bad, maybe with a better script we could have seen his talent shine, and the same goes for Kirsten Dunst who is sadly wasted in her role. Jodi Lynn O'Keefe, William Atherton, Fred Ward, and Dale Midkiff round out the cast, and all of whom try to make the best out of a bad situation, but its pretty clear why this went direct to video. The problem with the last two Crow films is the story is missing the raw emotional feel the first had, not to mention there is no other director that could helm any Crow movie the way Alex Proyas did. All in all, Salvation may be worth checking out, but don't expect much from it."
1,Grave,"Poor Brandon Lee must be spinning in his grave... his last film role is a classic, but then they decide to go ahead and build off the work that he did, and release two very crappy sequels. City of Angels was horrible, but this was even worse. Poor acting, poor directing, did I mention poor acting? Not worth the rental price, let alone purchase price."
1,Just not very good...,"I read and liked the comic books, loved the first Crow, hated the second, and just had to see this one. Thankfully I only rented it. Almost the exact same story and characterization as the first movie (many of the characters even resemble their counterparts from the original), mediocre at best acting, a bad, unoriginal script (there are many scenes almost identical to the original movie with similar dialogue!), and very poor execution (no pun intended). I always thought the Crow was supposed to be more about Justice and love than plain old vengeance. Without giving too much away, this was just a bloodfest which does not fit into the whole idea of the Crow. See it if you must but don't waste your money buying it."
5,SALVATION,"This movie is awesome movie way better than the second and almost as good as the first. Eric Mabius is an awesome crow and doesnt try to copy all of the other crows. He is a great actor and he made this film unbelievable and amazing, my friends even liked this movie and they dont even like any of the crow movies. To the director awesome job and i think that you should make the next crow movie. To sum it all up dont just rent this movie buy it."
1,PLEASE DONT BUY THIS,What an uninspired mess. Visually Eric Morbius is just boring to look at as the Crow. Character motivation is nowhere to be seen. We know who the main villian is minutes into the movie. Even the way the Crow goes about exacting his vengence is boring and insipid. I regret buying it and plan to just sell this copy on Ebay in order to make some money back
2,Just Not That Good,"This CD didn't impress me. I can't believe they covered ""Baby One More Time."" This is awful."
2,so dissapointed,first of all I am a big bowling for soup fan. that being said this album is just tv theme songs with the exception of a few songs. I did not realize this when i bought it. Compared to drunk enough to dance and a hangover you dont deserve I have to say its a flop. I just ordered the great burrito incident hopefully i like it better than this one. I also thinking about getting one of thier other albums but i'll wait and see how i like the burrito one.
3,"Christmas Classics, Redneck Style","I bought this CD specifically for 2 songs. Am very pleased with those. Some of the other songs are ok, some not. In any case, I think I got my money's worth."
2,And so goodnight...,"While it's very nice to have a final 'episode' to Angela Thirkell's long running chronicle this book misses too many marks to be be entirely satisfying. The change of author comes through all too clearly with a cloying sweetness evident throughout with none of the original acerbity to offset it. The sharpness of Thirkell's social commentary is also missing. I feel sure,for example, that although she may have planned the final outcome for her young characters Ludo and Lavinia she would also have had much to say on the changed world that made them a suitable match. A pleasant read but not an excellent one"
4,great thriller,"Before this book, I never knew heir hunters existed. The realization /that they do, boggled my mind through this whole book. The author takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that, while it may not be the usual fair for an heir hunter, is certainly plausible and in fact may be expected at some time through their career. Character development could have been a bit better, because I found it difficult sometmes to place the secondary characters and what group they belonged to. However the whirl wind intrigue and world travel to track down the heirs of a multmillion dollar fortune were more than enough to take my mind off any flaws in this book.Id like to see more from this author and in fact I could easily see Heir Hunter becoming a series."
3,An Interesting Book,"This book moved rapidly and was an anjoyable,although harmless read. Others have spoken of the plot line that exists in this work. Characters in this work appear to drop in an out of the story and there is much to be desired in the important area of chracter development. The story dos have some good double twists and, once the story takes shape, it is a good page turner. The book is not a great ork but if one is looking for a read that is rapid as well as harmless, this may well be the book to read. This is a debut novel and the writer is able to shoe much potential for future works."
2,too convoluted!!!!,wasted my time-------------too many characters; no character development... read michael connelly instead!! all his books are page turners!!
5,An Exciting Read - One Great New Author!!!,"The Heir Hunter is the first novel by Chris Larsgaard, and boy is it a good one. This suspensful book has well defined characters and grabs your attention from the start. The two main characters, Nick and Alex, are believable and likeable; I found myself rooting for them during their adventure. The topic of this book, hunting for heirs, is unique and new, which makes the book all the more interesting. This book weaves together a great story line, fascinating characters, and a fast paced adventure for a very good read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense, adventure and mystery books. I can't wait until Mr. Larsgaard writes again."
1,"The author wrote many of the reviews himself, I think.","I found the book rather amateur and the characters one-dimensional. There were way too many names and situations to follow at one time, and I often times felt like putting the book down and forgetting about it. The premise is interesting, but the book isn't."
2,Kingdom Come,"Kingdom Come by Larry Burkett & T Davis BunnKingdom Come: A Novelis very well written. It is full of twists and turns. Is Kingdom Come a cult? Who are the bad guys? What are they up to? I was thrilled with everything EXCEPT the ending. It doesn't end at all. It's a cliffhanger in the tradition of the 1930s movie serials. Is there a sequel? If not, I would not recommend the book to anyone because the ending is SO frustrating."
1,"Depressing, depressing, depressing!","Jane Hamilton is a wonderful writer. Her prose is easy to read and her descriptions vivid. However, as with the other Oprah books I've read it was extremely depressing and when I finished felt as though I had wasted my time. What is the point?"
4,GOOD BOOK,"THIS BOOK SHOWS HOW AN INDIVIDUAL (RUBY) WHO IS CONSTANTLY BERATED ALL OF HIS LIFE AND WHO HAS SOME UNRESOLVED FEELINGS, CAN SUDDENLY SNAP AND LASH OUT AT THE INDIVDUAL WHO BERATES HIM (RUTH'S MOTHER), WHILE HURTING SOMEONE HE CARES ABOUT IN THE PROCESS (RUTH)."
3,"I found this book very depressing, and hard to read.",I am in a book discussion in Warminster Pa and we are doing this book. It was sad and very depressing to read. But I did finish it.
2,Boring and a chore to read.,"I was under the influence of Oprah's Book Club List, unfortunately. It's a chore for me to pick this book up and finish it. The only book in my life that I could not finish was ""The Scarlet Letter"" and I tried twice!!! The writing style I had a hard time with...it is not difficult reading but it does not roll off your tongue (sort of speak). Too much rereading paragraphs because I've drifted off to thinking about unimportant things like "" maybe I should cut my finger nails"". It is a poor read!!!"
1,Where is the story?,This book started of middling put quickly drift to the monotonous. I know understand why the book is marked down 50%. Hamilton has been on the farm to long.
1,I hate this book,"This book started off good but later on it got boring and nothing exiting ever hapened until the end, which made completely no sence. I would not recomend this book not even to my worst enemy. The characters were boring and very dull."
3,I didn't think I liked the book...that was 4 weeks ago.,"As I read the book, I found myself waiting for something to happen--exciting, disturbing, it didn't matter, I just wanted to feel like the story was going somewhere. It never did. I finished the book feeling disappointed. However, I find I'm still thinking about the story...perhaps it did go somewhere afterall"
5,I can't wait to read more from Ms. Hamilton,"A Map of the World, I believe, was Ms. Hamilton's second book, and it was out and visible at bookstores. After reading it, and loving it, I discovered her first book, The Book of Ruth. I read it and loved it also. I was surprised to all of the sudden see it out and visible. I will read everything Ms. Hamilton writes. Yes, she is a dark one, but stirs emotions like crazy. I think the reason for the delay in publicity for ""Ruth"" is that somehow A Map of the World got more publicity, and after people read it, they looked for other books by Ms. Hamilton. I hope she's busy writing right now"
5,The Book of Ruth by: Jane Hamilton,This was an excellent novel of the dark side to each oneof us. The food and bird imagery is not to be ignored.This is a must read for the person who loves an allAmerican novel.
1,"My, that was unpleasant","As I read the book I kept seeing hints of the writer's brillance. There were some truly poetic sentances here and there. Unfortuanately, whatever message she was trying to get across was a little too obscure and at the end I was left saying, ""my that was unpleasent""."
2,Depressing Book,"I read this book several years ago, and I've never forgiven Oprah for recommending it. I read it in one long sitting, from cover to cover, waiting for the hope to come. It never did.The characters have stayed with me, but it isn't in a good way. It is an example of painting a picture of a life with words, that's why I gave it 2 stars. The fact that it wasn't a life worth writing about is why I recommend you look elsewhere.This is as depressing and pointless of a story as I have ever read. I suppose if you are looking for a reason to wear black and cry in the corner it would be a decent read, but I found nothing of value in it. There are no lessons learned, and nothing of substance to be found in this story.It is a shame to see such literary ability focus on something so meaningless."
1,not worth reading,"We read this for a library book group. We managed a decent discussion from reading it, but I would never suggest it to someone else.The narrative style is boring! Do I need to know every last detail of Ruth's thought process? NO! It seems to go and on for pages on end, nothing much of interest to read about. It would make a good one hour Dr. Phil show, if you are interested in reading about dysfunctional family relationships. In the end there is a murder. That is the surprise element in the story. Then again, we can hear about that type of thing everyday on the news.I'm surprised anyone would like this book. It was a total waste of my time!"
1,What a depressing book!,"I started this book before work this morning. In less than half an hour I knew I couldn't go on with it. This evening, curiosity led me to flip through to the middle and skimmed some of it. Then I got to the horrendous later part and it was like watching a train wreck; I didn't want to keep reading but did. I did not, however, read to the end. Was so depressed by the time I put it down, I was glad I wasted no more than one day reading just parts of it. Don't know how the rest of you who didn't like it managed to plow through it. The author does have a way with words but I have no desire to read anything else by her. I would think someone who is already depressed could be pushed to suicide after reading this."
3,Not too bad,"It was an ok book. I read it last week, and I really can't think of too much to write about it. I didn't actively hate it while I read it, and I did read it rather quickly. Story was a bit depressing. My willingness to suspend my disbelief wasn't achieved, but close enough. I may just not want to think that people can really be this mean and depressing, but I bet there are. Matt bothered me throughout the entire story."
2,Not what I expected,"This wasn't at all what I expected. Once I was done I understand what the author was trying to do but while reading the book I was wondering what she was doing.It's not a bad book, just not what I expected. To be honest I wanted more of what went on in the club - not why they were there."
1,This book is awful,"After the first few pages, I had to force myself to read this book. It is boring and delves into the monotony of the protagonist, Ruth's life. I kept reading, waiting for something to happen because the author did a good job of foreshadowing something that happens to the characters in the book. In my humble opinion, the story did not represent hope at all and the main character does not emerge ""a butterfly"" like some other reviewers have posted. She remains in a life of monotonous boredom and is only saved from the abuse she participates in because of pain and sorrow brought on from abuse. This read was a complete waste of time and has left me feeling depleted and empty, not uplifted and full of hope like I had anticipated."
2,Well...,"Depressing, real but somthing missing! I think the story in total was depressing and I kept asking myself why she didnt do anything prodoctive with here life. But I kind of got the answer when she finally left her small village to visit her aunt. She was just a scared small town girl, thats were I found the book real. I have alitle problem identifying what is missing but I guess I just found the book boring. I also think that it dint build it self up enough for the ""dramatic"" ending. The ending I found not in harmony with the rest of the book...to unreal! If I have nothing better to do with my time I might pick up a book by Jane Hamilton again! Arni"
5,Amazing book,It's about a young girl who has a mean mom.It gives the feel of you are not alone to abuse victims.Helped me alot
1,Beautiful? Award-winning? No: Gruesome and Depressing,"It's hard to believe that a book like this could reach the bestseller list. The author should be ashamed of herself. No hope whatsoever is offered to Ruth, the main character. I had to think for days to decide what, if anything, good I could gain from this book. I finally decided that it is the perfect depiction of what a human life would be like if it were totally devoid of beauty. Since when has writing the darkest, most depressing book been something to brag about?"
4,A difficult but haunting book.,"I was drawn into the book from the first page. I could hearin my mind's eye Ruth's voice as she related her life. Adifficult life in a small town in ""anywhere"" USA. To me shecould have been from the south. I can hear a liltingsouthern accent as she narrates the book. I knew many ofthe people she describes, my parents are from a similar place.The characters have different names, but the situations areoh so similar. So many live this life of hardship totragedy. But in the end there is still hope that one willovercome."
4,"different, but enthralling","I was expecting something different from this book, I was somewhat put off byits style, until I became accustomed and began to understand it more.So many of the analogies which seem odd and out of place seem to indicate Ruth's feelings which she pushes down in order to follow her ""logic"". I did not identify very much with Ruth, I felt as if her denial of things was extreme. I wanted desperately for her to make it, to achieve the happier, more fruitfull life her aunt tried to help her find. However I never really felt she would get away from what held her down."
5,A GREATER CAPACITY FOR UNDERSTANDING,I finished this book with an overwhelming feeling of sadness and anxiousness. Jane Hamilton does an extroadinary job of bringing the reader into the life of Ruth and in myself a compelling need to reach out to her. The prose is outstanding and the way in which the author tells the story makes it impossible to leave the book without vivid pictures in your mind
4,sad but compelling,"One of the things I admired most about this book was the fact that Ruth was obviously intelligent, yet had trouble expressing this when speaking. The errors in grammar that were interjected into her dialogue, together with her thoughtful narrative, were truly evident of her essence. Ruth was tremendously admirable character, who was strong, yet vulnerable, trusting, yet not always truthful. Her struggles with Ruby, and especially with May, were heartwrenching. Her endearing love for them both was both frustrating and touching. My only disappointment was that May was never able to resolve the hurt contained within her realtionships with those who were close to her."
2,Well-written but lacks any redeeming quality to the story,"What most disturbed me about this book is that the main character, Ruth, seemed not terribly upset about the horrific murder of her mother. In fact, the last few pages implied that she was set free by the murderer! While her mother was blindly devoted to the gifted brother, at Ruth's expense, she was not as bad towards her daughter as to deserve her indifference. The author writes well and has created authentic characters and their lives. One of her themes is ""the meanness"" that people are born with and have to overpower. She illustrates this beautifully in the relationships between men and women, parents and children. Still, I missed the ""hope"" that many reviewers found at the end of the book. I felt I had been in the presence of real evil in the last few pages."
1,Most depressing book I've ever read,"This book is well-written, but it contains the most difficult, depressing subject matter I have ever encountered in a fiction work (and I've read a few). By the time I got finished reading it, I actually felt like I'd lived in some story that would be on the news. I haven't read any of Oprah's book recommendations since. (Sorry Oprah.)"
4,Emotionally riveting ! A love/hate relationship you can feel,"I have to say that I probably would not have read this book if it wasn't for Oprah Winfrey. The books that I usually read are mysteries with romance. I call them easy reading books. Jane Hamilton had me feeling everything Ruth was feeling from the moment I started reading the first page. It touched all my emotions. The characters - May, Ruby, Ruth, and Justy come to life so vividly. I felt like I could touch them and hold them, even strangle them for their stupidity. This book did start out slow but it worked into a chilling climax. I'm glad I didn't put it back on the shelf. All I can say is thank you Oprah for opening my eyes. Thank you Jane Hamilton for making me feel grateful for all the blessings I have in my life"
2,The Book Of Ruth,"I read this book a few week ago and found it disturbing and far from one of my favorites. I would consider it hard to finish. The story is very sad all the way through. You start to wish something good would happen to this girl. It's one disaster after another, her life is horrible...."
1,What a chore to get through!,"I have read many of Oprah's picks and have enjoyed them. This surely was the exception. The characters were not ""real"" to me. They didn't grab my attention and I didn't care enough about them to be interested in the book. I finished it but it certainly was a chore. It was not the book I hoped it would be."
1,This is one of the worst books I've ever read.,"The pace of this book was as slow as molasses in winter. I kept reading, thinking it was going to get better and then the stupid thing ended with probably the worst ending I've ever read. The author should be force-fed Prozac. Come on Oprah, give me a break! I only read it because of your recommendation. This was the one and only Oprah recommended book I subjected myself to."
5,Ruth,This book was enjoyable to read and the end was quite a shock. I would recommend this book to anyone. It was wonderfully written.
5,Real,"Growing up in a small PA town, I met some individuals who could easily fit the portrait of Ruth. Anyone who finds this book boring, is lacking depth of the mind, heart, and soul. Jane Hamilton has an amazing ability to become the character in a completely convincing manner."
3,Boring,"The book was boring. It took too long/too many pages/too many aimless words for the plot to get anywhere. Thus, 'Ruth' seemed to have a lot of 'filler.' And, perhaps the end is somewhat contrived; how lucky to have a middle class educated aunt (read: fairy godmother) to save her. Hamilton's 'A Map of the World' also is puffed up/out in pages beyond what drives the plot. Perhaps the short story is a better medium for Hamilton. I bought and read 'Ruth' because I was curious about Oprah's picks. So many seem to be replications on the same theme. The best of this genre is Dorothy Allison's Bastard Out of Carolina; Oprah should pick this."
2,Depresssssing!,"I have now read 2 books recommended by Oprah. Does she only recommend books that leave you so sad. I felt this book was way off the mark. Did no one in the school system or even her Aunt Sid who was only 40 miles away care one iota? Ruth seems to love being the victim and even when everything goes wrong, she still doesn't get it. No one can be that clueless. If Oprah only recommends these types of stories than I am out of the running"
5,Disturbing but wonderfully written,"I had this book sitting on my shelf for sometime since Oprah first recommended it. I happen to pick it up recently to take to the beach. I must admit it was not an easy read and there were many times when I wondered why I was reading it because it was so painful. The ending was not unexpected for me because I felt like we were always leading to a crescendo only I was secretly hoping it would have been a happy one. Needless to say, it was certainly more appropriate than anything sugar coated. I was truly emotionally touched by Ruth's wonderful ability to look past the imperfections of those around her. I completely agree with other reveiwers in that this is not a light read but one that will never totally leave your heart and soul. The book is well worth the effort."
5,A reader,"Those who didn't like this book for its sad and tragic ending must realize that one of the main points of the book is just that, life can be tragic and sad. I loved Ruth like no other character I have read. I cried with pity for her only to laugh out loud a few pages later at her insightful wit. I was overcome by Ruth's desire to be loved and ""normal"". The complexity of it's characters, who you will love and hate, helped to keep it intriguing. I will never forget this book."
5,I loved this book,"Ruth is someone who is making due with all that life has thrown at her. She is intelligent, sad, lonely and often angry, but she is not afraid. I loved the character development of both Ruth and Ruby. It has been several days since I finished this book and I cannot stop thinking about it."
4,A faint gleam of hope in a bleak landscape,"What ever happened to that odd, quiet girl in your high school class? Ruth is that invisible girl, poor and proud, but curious, solid, and worth knowing all the same. She has a talent for bowling, a talent for loving, a gift for friendship, and a longing for understanding and truth. Her narrative looks at her bleak life unsparingly, tries to make sense of her suffering, and doesn't dodge her own culpability. We listen as she tries to make sense of tragedy, tries to understand the glib promises of faith, and tries to learn to be the mother her child needs. We count our blessings in comparison, but with a shudder, realize that ""there but for grace, go I."""
2,Depressing!,"This book was depressing, depressing, depressing. There was nothing enjoyable about it. I seldom start a book and not finish it so I did read all of this book hoping that something would redeem it! Nothing did!"
1,The book of Ruth,"I REALLY disliked this book. The Book of Nothing. I found the characters to be very shallow, the story to be very shallow and at the end of the day you really didn't care what happened to anyone. I feel that this book WAS a waste of time and if Oprah had not picked it, I don't believe it would have been significant in any way."
2,Too much beating around the bush and pruning it as well.,"The story is so typical of modern female authors...PREDICTABLE! What is up with this style of writing? I can't understand why female authors have to digress and 'emote' everything until the actual meaning of the text is lost. If you are looking for a 'typical modern' book, or feel that ""Oprah's Book Club Knows Best"" then this is an appropriate book. If however, you feel that life is worth digging a little deeper and depth of insight is a treasure, then I recommend looking elsewhere for inspiration. Jane Hamilton is admirable but lacks originality."
2,Depressing,"If you are at all prone to depression or suicide do NOT read this book. It is well written and well crafted, but to what end?"
1,Waste of Time,"This book was the biggest waste of my time. I'm not sure why I kept reading it, I guess I was waiting for it to get better. I thought the ending didn't fit at all. Don't waste your time, unless you have lots of time, then I recommend doing something else besides read this book."
2,"Too Dark, Too Pointless, and Much Too Long","Had I not been on vacation, with nothing other than this handy to read, I would have dropped it and left it for dead.I am tired of being dragged into the ""Oprah"" choices only to find they are always about below average, under privileged, tragic souls. Is Oprah not aware there are strong, healthy people out there, who not only lead productive useful lives, but raise productive children who also contribute to society, without benefit of abuse and mistreatment?I read painfully about the horrible lives these poor mentally challenged people endured, always with a sense of impending doom. Quite frankly, all but two of the characters (Ruth & Ruby) are individuals who have made messes of their own lives and are the very sort of folks I have worked hard to insure I do not have to live near and certainly do not want my children growing up around. I would ask you then, why would I or any one else want to read about these dregs of society?"
2,BOOK OF RUTH,"Sorry Oprah, this was a flop. The whole time you're reading about Ruth, you wonder what the point of the book is. I have to admit that I had sympathy for the girl, but when you find out what the point actually is, you are mortified. If the book had focused more on her getting her life back together and finding actual real happiness, that would have been a good story!"
3,Okay Sherry I read the book!!!,"My friend Sherry has been trying to get me to read this book for two years. I have to admit and I am sorry if I offend anyone, but I was happy when he killed the mama. I felt she had it comming. She should have left him and his backward wife alone. It was sad for the sons to grow up with out a dad, however such is life. Women can learn a lesson from this book, stop dogging men who are already being dogged who are already down and out. If you can't help the situation then let it alone. Period. Or you too can be stabbed in the celler on xamas eve."
3,No light at the end of the tunnel...,"This book was well written and thought provoking but it broke my heart. Thoroughly depressing, it bleeds the spirit of all hope! Read this only on a bright sunny day when all the world is right because even then its dark cloud will hover over your mind."
3,The Book of Ruth,"An interesting story, but I did not like the end. It tells of a young girl's stuggle in a poor and dysfunctional family. How she tried to gain independence and fell in love. Her husband was strange and in the end was even stranger! A bit too morbid and violent for me."
3,It was OK,"I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars because I really didn't love it. This book was chosen for my book club so I had to read it. I think if it wasn't for my club I wouldn't have finished it. Despite not enjoying the book we did have quite a good conversation about this book. It brought about a lot of good conversation and discussion. The characters were complex and well-developed in my opinion, but they were overall very sad folks. You kept waiting for things to get better for them. I felt like the entire book I spent ""waiting"" for something to happen that never really did. Without giving too much away, there was a climatic moment in the book that was dramatic and shocking. I suppose it is worth it to read it to get to this part. It's at the very end though. It is worht a read if you like to analyze different people's personalities and what makes them how they are. That was mostly what our discussion was about, just talking about why these people were the way that they were."
4,Real life is hard,"Did you ever think about how when you see some ""sensational, human interest"" tragedy on the evening news, that there are real people in that story? The news wants you to think it's entertainment. Meanwhile, Hamilton writes a story that reads like real. Hard struggles, and nobody is all good or all bad. People muddle through. Thankfully, most people do not experience tragedy. And yet I think most readers will find something familiar in the Book of Ruth."
2,Hit like a Sledgehammer; instant pain then a dull ache,"I didn't see the attraction of this book. Perhaps because it was so highly recommended to me, I expected too much, or at least more. No offense to Jane Hamilton, but I felt only lackluster empathy for her dangerously benign characters, none of whom for which I had a modicum of repect or pity. With the Biblically-allusive title, I expected to discover some redeeming quality in the titled-character, but, instead, I found only a cavernous soul in a box-car of a life. The murder-by-decapitation twist was not only unexpected but resemblent of a poor, fictionalized Vincent Bugliosi novel. I have to say, I was tragically disappointed in this book."
4,Helped Understand My Sister's Dysfunction,"I finally can give up my guilt and confusion over my own sister's mild retardation and choice to live in a world I can only imagine. My brother and sister and I have been trying to change our mentally challenged sister's quality of life by giving her our ideals for a ""good life"", but to no avail. This book finally let me see that we all have choices, and those choices are based on our capacity to maintain that choice. My sister chooses to live with a husband who is also mentally challenged, and they consistantly make questionable decisions regarding their 4 children (who are slow) and themselves. I now can respect that their life-style is theirs, and my life-style is mine, and I am not responsible for changing her life to come up to my standards. It has been a long time coming to this peace of mind, but with the help of this book, I am at peace."
3,"Good writing, unbelievable characters","Jane Hamilton is a gifted writer. I'd like to see what she could do with creative nonfiction. I guess this book suffers from my having read it soon after All Over but the Shoutin' by Rick Bragg, a wonderful true account of struggle and hardship in a less privileged corner of the world. I simply could not believe in Ruth. Usually it takes a bit of education and a wider view of the world to arrive at her secular humanist insights."
1,PLEASE GIVE ME MORE ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS,"This book was very well recommended to me by friends and, by it's title, made me look forward to reading it. Well, I have been misled by the book title and the recommendations I received. I consider myself very well read and found it very hard to read. Please don't purchase this book unless you have many, a lot, mucho, mass, gobs of time to read this neverending story."
3,Enough to make you want to read more of Miss Hamilton,"I read this in one night so that has to say something. It was sad, eyeopening, moving and thought provoking but in the end I could not help but feel a little I don't know possibly repulsed. There was something just not quite right. Still it was enough to make me want to find and read Jane Hamilton's other books."
3,"Good style, but redundant","A well written book, from a basic, stylistic perspective. Two main problems. First, the poor white trash thing gets a little over the top after awhile. OK, we get the point, again. It's just the setting so give it a rest. Second, what's the idea of the teen slasher movie ending? it's not truly tragic, it's hollywood gruesome and detracts from the reality and representativeness of the novel. All in all, well done if you are into that sort of thing."
2,Don't waste your time.,It is predictable that this book comes recommended on the women's talk show beat. This book is neither inspirational nor empowering. Ruth talks about the meanness of her mother and others in her life. When was she ever kind or considerate? The one nice thing she did (Reading to the blind woman) was an opportunity for her to complain until she got something out of it - someone to listen to her. Her life was certainly tough but she never fought back. This book was a sorry excuse at defending the meek
3,Another sad and dreary tale.,"Jane Hamilton is a gifted writer. Unfortunately I found the subject matter of this book to be so disturbing and depressing that I couldn't enjoy it. Yes, I read the whole thing because I always finish what I start. Since this is the third book I have read and disliked that Oprah Winfrey recommended, I have now sworn off Oprah's Book List. If she liked it, I will not attempt to read it. I think that the world is full of tragedy and joy. I choose not to wallow in the details of personal tragedies. Others may enjoy this book but I did not. I am on a quest for well written and joyful reading"
5,"disturbing and tragic, yet beautifully written","I found this novel haunting. I work with young people who are low functioning (such as Ruth) and with young people who suffer from deep emotional problems (such as Ruby). Hamilton has definite insight in creating the minds of these two characters. When I picked up the book I had no idea what it was about and no idea where it was going but I became very attached to the characters and hated to see the book end. The ending was shocking with nothing happy about it which just added to the book's credibility. I don't think people realize how many ""Ruths"" & ""Rubys"" there are among us--and how many ""Justys"" will be left to pick up their pieces"
3,Too Long,"I am a reader. I have been trying to follow Oprah's book club. However, I did not start reading the books she's choosen when the club first started. I have however gone back to try and catch up. This was her first pick. It's a ""DEEP"" book but I felt it took to long to get to the point, with a really good book this is not necessary."
5,There's a Ruth everywhere,"This book was not a turn pager in the beginning however in the last chapters I could not put it down. Not a complicated read. Basically, the life of a disadvantaged girl trying to make the most of it. A girl who gets left behind as her peers have ""tools,"" to go beyond their landscapes and make changes that put them in the direction of a better life."
4,Good or bad...this one stays with me.,I read this 3 or 4 years ago and at the time I thought that I didn't really care for it -- the negative tone and VERY dramatic end. The funny thing is that years later this is one novel that I can remember quite clearly. It really makes you *feel* something and maybe that's what good literature is supposed to do.
2,unconvincing...,"I thought the narration was good, but unconvincing that Ruth was supposed to be mentally deficient...the way she narrates proves that she wasn't as stupid as she and others thought she was. I also find it interesting that Oprah's book picks are usually stories about lower class families surrounded by violence, abuse, and sexual frustration."
4,"Haunting, I can't decide if I really liked it","Last night after I finished the book, I thoughtI hated it, but today I can't stop thinking aboutit. I searched the internet to find what others have thought, to justify my feelings... that hasto say something. I can't say I identifiedwith any of the characters, but I must say thatthe writing was so well done that I found myselffeeling sick and generally uncomfortable throughthe whole book - especially the ending. It's thesame feeling I got when I read ""The Liar's Club"".I would recommend this book for those who canadmire a novel for it's craft. I know everythingI felt, the author intended."
2,Read the last two chapters first...,"When I was in high school I read Catcher in the Rye. My teacher at the time told me to read the last chapters first and then read the book like normal. Well, where was he for this book? I recommend reading the last few chapters first and then go beginning to end. I was truly disappointed by this book! The end took such a crazy...never in your life would you have guessed it twist that I felt cheated! I missed several important clues during my reading of the book because I didn't see their significance until the end and it was too late. I felt it was an ok book but would have been greatly enhanced if I had known what was at the end. I do not think reading the last few chapters will ruin the book but enhance it"
2,"GRIM, but gripping","I could not like Ruth, no matter how hard I tried. She deserved all that she got. In all my favorite books I can empathize with the main character. This is a depressing, disappointing (nothing ever got better for Ruth) but well-written novel. I really expected more"
4,Good book. Weak ending.,"The fact that I am still thinking about this book a fews daysafter finishing it must mean something. I read through most of theposted reviews and agree with many who said it was a ""beautifully written book."" Indeed it was. For such a simple minded woman, Ruth came up with some beautiful, profound observations on life. I felt for her; I rooted for her; I just wish I had been able to witness more of her recovery. I agree with the reviewer who said she wanted to shake Ruth. Me too! She had such potential, seen only by Miss Finch and Aunt Sid. In the end, I'm somewhat ambivalent about the book as a whole. I enjoyed the telling of Ruth's story, but I felt the ending was not satisfying."
3,Realistically fictional,Hamilton makes a clear statement in this novel. She illustrates the life of a young and innocent girl who blooms into an experienced yet naive woman. Her younger life story touched me as no other book was able to do. She had most of the same feelings as me and it made me feel a bit less lonely and left out in the grand scheme of things. I can feel a little motivation to stop from making the same mistakes Ruth did as i have the rest of my life to look forward to. This book truly opened my eyes to the many masks we wear and the many ways we make excuses for out human nature. I quite enjoyed this novel and it will stick with me forever. And when i reread this book someday i hope i can look back on my life without the regrets Ruth had.
3,"The Book of Ruth is beautifually written, but so bleak.","Jane Hamilton is a wonderful writer, but I wouldn't reccommend this book. It offers the reader a story of some very trashy people who make terrible choices and in the end are left with anger and no faith. I don't understand the author's point, unless it is simply to depress us."
2,Not one I've ever recommended to anyone,"I found this book to be boring and unbelievable. Esecially the ending, which I found felt very contrived. Even though I have had not trouble reading books of this nature in the past, I found myself disturbed by this one because horrible things were happening to a woman that I couldn't feel compassion for. I would find myself drifing off through most of it so when something caught my attention I had lost the context it was happening in. I would have to hear lots of amazing things before I would try this author again."
3,Good for discussion,"My book club read THE BOOK OF RUTH as our September pick. This book was a very good discussion book as there are a lot of situations in the plot to discuss. Things like, ""What is wrong with Ruth that she can not get her life on track?"" and ""How can she be attracted to that skuzzy Ruby?"" and Why did she stay with her mother and let herself continue to be abused?"". So, there are certainly many questions to discuss concerning life questions.However, it is not a ""feel good"" book so I probably would not recommend it for pleasure reading. Emotionally, this book is a downer and I had to get out of the house after finishing it to shake off the melancholy. I checked this out from the library and am ready to get it back to them like a bad talisman."
4,A book which i can return to,"I have read and re-read this book so many times, it is silly. Jane Hamilton allows us into such a world of happiness, grief, torment, fulfillment, simple joy and tragic circumstances that to read this book only once is like to take only a small bite of an exquisite meal. Can you not catch a whiff of the rich earth when Ruth does? Do you not see Ruby's teeth glinting in the moonlight! Can't you hear May barking orders and hacking her cough? I first read Jane Hamilton with Map of The World, which is an excellent book also, but I find this one richer. It reminds me in a strange way, of another book which I have read and re-read, This Much I Know is True by Wally Lamb. Totally different story, but the ability of the author to awaken all your senses is amazing"
5,I was bawling like a baby by the end!!,"This is an amazing book! I have to write an essay on it now, for Englsih class, and I will definitely write a good review of each character. Ruth, May, Ruby, Justy, Aunt Sid and Daisy (howcome everyone is ignoring Daisy?) are all some of the most beautiful characters I have ever met. Yeah, its a depressing book, but shouldnt something be emotional for one for the book to have an impact?? I know I will never be the same. Get some kleenex for the last couple chapters!"
4,Trailer Trash Are People Too,"It is a sad truth in today's society that many of us who read books look down on those who don't. Hamilton's Ruth belongs to the set most people would classify as ""trailer trash."" But Hamilton shows us how any person can bloom with love and guidance. There is a sophistication of understanding and compassion in Ruth that many of the educated would do well to emulate. The story is well-told, touching, and believable."
1,BORING-DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL,I had to force myself to read this book. I had heard so much about it that I thought it must get better or have a great ending. It never happened. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone
4,Delightful,"This delightful coming of age novel is slow to grab you, but once you're in, you just can't get enough of Ruth and her family. A quick read, but fulfulling just the same."
4,Great deal for so many bits,I got this for $3 on a Friday Sale and think it was an excellent deal for all the bits. It is well-packaged and keeps everything neat and tidy. I've used several of the bits with no quality issues. This would make a great gift!
2,Justice and its ambiguity,"This book was not very insightful. Dejasay's ideas may be original, but they are terribly organized. This guy has the worst grammar in the game. As a legal positivist, his prescriptions for government are so vague they are almost useless. His ambiguous style of writing, complemented by his unclear ideas make for a poor read."
2,I Was Hoping For A CENTURY of Pro Football,"Although this DVD had some great moments for any football fan, overall I was disappointed. I purchased this DVD without reading the details first. Instead of showing a ""History"" of Pro Football, 1/4th of this DVD focuses on a few, self-proclaimed stars of modern day (Keyshawn Johnson, Randy Moss, etc). Another 1/4 focuses on a few ""football families"" (Grieses, the Mannings, and the Dorsetts). I found the coaching section the best...at least the DVD showed some old footage of some of the best. Read the details of this DVD before you buy..the title is not representative of the content."
5,A Must Have in Kid's Reads!,"I loved this book so much that I bought one for each of my kids so they can read it to their kids when the time comes. For now, they're all still young and truly enjoy this fantastically fun story at home! :)"
5,Mississippi Harmonica,"Works great and great packaging, I am sure I will be hearing alot of it from my 13 year old son who wanted it for Christmas"
3,Disappointing,Very disappointing this set includes two games that already been released on two previous editions before. The 1980 NLCS clincher against Houston and game 5 of the 2008 World Series against Tampa. I'm sure MLB could've easily found two other games to substitute instead. Maybe Steve Carlton's 300th win or his original breaking the strike out record. Howabout the dramatic way Mike Schmidt hit his 500th home run against Pittsburgh as examples of something original. If they wanted to include something from 1980 howabout game 4 against Houston or the division clincher against Montreal.
2,please dont buy,"John Saxon is a good actor, as for the rest of this movie it was no good. How this guy above me rates it 4 stars i will never know.He already told you what the movie is based on so in conclusion if you are a fan of Zombie cinema as I am and you like movies like Dawn/Day/Night of the living dead or Zombi By L.Fulci or Dead Alive etc.. Im sure you get my point this is not like those at all. And I dont really consider it worth the $$$ it cost. Please dont waste your $ as if you are a zombie film fan you will be very disssapointed, very. 2 stars I gave it only because the acting is pretty good. You will also have some trouble selling as I tried and it dont come up in the systems , i tried getting rid of it last week."
3,Remakes and a few essential songs.,"First off, most of the big songs here are remakes...but, but, but, there are a few songs here that are not remakes and are essential to any country music collection.Country Green, Woman Sensuous Woman, Touch the Morning, One Day at a Time, and Bring Back Your Love To Me are all the original hit recordings.Now all the rest, such as Oh Lonesome Me, are remakes. Not bad remakes by any means, but remakes none the less.Some advice: Don't look at anything on Curb records if you want the original RCA recordings."
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS!!,"A true Don Gibson fan would know that these tracks are from 1970, when Don was recording for HICKORY records. Almost all of Don's original hits were on RCA. The ones on this cd lack the quality and originality of the RCA tracks. If you're looking for the original hits get the RCA package."
1,don gibson- 18 greatest hits,"1. The tracks on this CD are not the orginal hit recordings.2. If you buy on this basis, you'll be disappointed.3. You'll be able to tell from the very first track that thesewere cuts from recording secessions they didn't originallyplan on releasing."
