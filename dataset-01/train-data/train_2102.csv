4,A Great Moderate Cardio Workout,"I have Hip Hop Cardio by Jennifer Galardi and this one is a toned down version of that one. It is still a great moderate workout, I was sweating by the end of it, but I am also able to very adequately keep up with her Hip Hop Cardio and with Zumba workouts. So this provides a nice break from the aforementioned cardio workouts. I love Jennifer Galardi and she provides great instruction within the video so it is easy to learn and then keep up."
1,Very discouraged--anyone want to trade??,"After using other Prevention Fitness System dvds (from the library), I thought I would purchase a cardio/dance selection. Not enough information on the liner notes to let you know that this is not for beginners in terms of following the instructor and learning the steps. I have taken classes and never had a problem keeping up and learning the steps; she goes too fast, does not pay attention to the music and adds-on too quickly. I skipped through to each type of dance hoping I just couldn't get the last one, but found the next one just as frusting. I may just go back to taking tapes out of the library to be certain before purchasing. Wish I could return it for exchange to another fitness dvd."
3,Not for the uncoordinated!,"I agree with previous reviewers that this DVD doesn't give you nearly enough time to learn the steps, nor do they do it slow enough for most unexperienced (and uncoordinated) ""dancers"". The steps and speed were a bit of a surprise coming from Prevention. If you can dance or are very coordinated and pick up steps fast, give this a try, but I really regret wasting my money on it. The best part of the whole DVD for me was the bonus section on ab work."
4,300 lbs and I can do it,"This video is awesome! At 300 lbs I had to adjust some moves slightly. When I first watched it I cried because I thought I could never keep up, but Jennifer is so enthusiastic I kept working and in 2 weeks I am able to complete the entire 52 minutes. I feel better physically and mentally. I will be purchasing all other fitness videos she offers.*Rodneys wife*"
4,Like most of it,"I like most of the Prevention videos. This one is fun, but I did find the hip-hop section to be rather awkward, even after doing it many times. I end up mostly doing my own thing during that part, or I just skip it. The rest of the video provides a good workout. I really like how the ballet routine is near the end, leading into the cool down."
3,Too little time spent on each move,"For those who are already used to dance programs, I'll bet this is fun. Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that there are not enough ""how to"" shots. Perhaps it is not meant for beginners; it doesn't claim that it is. I shy away from dance workouts at the Y, so I thought I would try this at home to get more familiar with basic moves. I don't even want to do it in the privacy of my own home because I feel so uncoordinated."
2,I hate this DVD.,"My mother had bought me this as a gift. I was excited because I LOVE dancing. I was excited to put it in and do it, but when I had pressed play,it was SO hard for me to follow because it was SO fast. She didn't explain the moves that well, she just went RIGHT into it. It's fast, I barely was able to keep up let alone do the move. You need SO much space, and she is so annoying by adding ""personality"" in almost every sentence. This is definitely not something I'm into. the ONLY one I like is the Ballet one because 1: Slower! 2: She's great at explaining that one instead of all the others! 3: It's way less-harsher on the knees.My knees were killing me, and not in the ""sore"" way, in the ""I think I popped something"" way. It hurt So bad!Not worth it!"
1,Not a good workout and hard to follow,"The concept of this video is good, but it just doesn't work. The steps are hard to follow. What makes this worse is that you can barely (and I mean BARELY) hear the music. There are times when I couldn't even tell there was music. So, that just makes staying in rhythm even harder. And I'm not in great shape, but I didn't find this challenging at all. Maybe it was because I spent most of my time trying to figure the moves out rather than actually doing them. Don't waste the money on this ""workout."""
2,choose this dvd if you want to be discouraged and feel crappy about yourself,"I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video ""easy to master"". I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow. The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork! I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner. I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough! I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much. She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be. The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves. I hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing."
1,Helps To Be a Professional Dancer To Figure This One Out,"I was frustrated by this DVD. This DVD is not typical of the Prevention series. The instructor went through the steps too fast and did not explain the techniques well enough while she launched right into well rehearsed routines with her students. This was about her having fun with her students, not teaching the viewer the dance steps.The cameraperson felt it wasn't necessary to show the dancer's feet for several critical dance steps.By the time the instructor got to the slower less complicated dances, I completely lost interest. This is the first exercise DVD I threw away because to me it is useless."
4,good pace workout,"I haven't worked out with this DVD yet, but I did review it first because I am not a dancer. An intermediate level was my first impression. It seems like a nice introductory demonstration about a few of the dance moves in the workout would be helpful for a beginner. Otherwise, it appears fun."
3,Didn't break a sweat...,"I have two other Prevention DVD's that I use often and was looking forward to trying this. The dance moves are somewhat fun, but there isn't enough cardio movement. I don't feel like I get much of a workout either through toning or by burning calories. Some of the dance segments may take a few times to master, but they aren't terribly complicated. I would recommend this to someone looking for a low intensity workout with dance based moves who either catches on easily or doesn't mind watching the video a few times to learn them."
3,decent book,"this book is really just a bunch of sample questions. it has tons, yes. they are tough also and the book does give the answers but thats the books whole form of teaching. it tells about the exam, but not enough. dont let me scare you off, if youre planning to take the test, buy it. the questions are of the same type. just reallly borring!"
5,GREAT BUY!!!,"Alright, here it is. There are many compilations out there that has a great selection of hits. Still, if the songs in the collection are a bunch three minute short versions; let's face it, the collection isn't all that. Hey, I was out there in the clubs shaking my booty right along with everybody else. I remember all those great dance-jams that seemed to go on forever (and you were glad because you hoped those songs and that moment would never end). My point is that if the compilations with songs from that era which are coming out now are not the full length extended versions then it's basically a waste of time and money.Now, all I have of this series is volume I, II & IV. So, regarding this series, that's all I have to go by. Still, if you're like me and is looking for a disco-compilations of not only just a great collection of hits but also the full length extended versions of them then this is and another compilation series called ""THE BIG 12 INCHES"" is it."
5,"at work, at home","I started using the mandolin at work, I loved the ease of it. The onlt place I could find it was Amazon,. I've been happy with it ever since!"
1,difficult to use and painful,"I had this for a couple of years and found that the food guide didn't work well. It's hinged on one side and is supposed to glide in the track on the side but frequently stuck, left the track, and/or didn't stay attached to the food I was cutting. This led to problems; in my case, 3 stitches for a divet in my left hand. It went into the trash as I only need to experience this once. So be careful out there!"
2,Cumbersome and infuriating,"I hate this slicer. I've had it for a few years and every now and then decide to give it another try. The blades are very dull, and I find that there is rarely an ""easy motion over blade"". Instead, I have had to force my vegetables across the blade in a jabbing motion. I've cut my self enumerable times when I completely gave up on the slanted grip that causes uneven slices and forced the veggies across it by hand. Tomatoes always get stuck and twist around, resulting in a goopy mess. I think the only vegetable I've had an easy time cutting is a cucumber.One good point about this slicer is that it's easy to take apart to clean, although you hardly have to worry about cleaning it if it rarely comes out of storage."
2,Good intentions,"I'm surprised to see the all or nothing reviews; it makes me wonder if the production line produces some better than others!I received this as a birthday gift a couple of years ago and have been dissappointed from the first use. While I love that it has so many options and features, I hate that they don't work very well.The V-blade was sharp, but not in the right places? I was blown away by its lack of cutting through some of the sturdier vegetables like carrots and beets at times.I actually now spend the extra time in cutting my vegetables instead of using this product because of the hassle it causes. That was my cue to start looking for a better mandoline."
2,Disappointing product,"I had the opportunity to test this mandoline once without actually having to buy it, and I am thankful for that. (This is not even close to being on par with the Bron mandoline, but I guess that is what you get for spending a third of the price.) Anyway, I tried slicing cucumbers and carrots, as well as julienning the latter vegetable, and the pieces were far from uniform. The food holder was clumsy and difficult to use, especially with the orange that I tried to slice. None of the blade units contained particularly sharp blades, which you definately need in a mandoline. The only reason that I am even giving this object two stars instead of one is because of the safety rail, which did make me feel more comfortable about using a mandoline in the first place."
4,LOVE this thing!,"I have always wanted a mandoline but there was no way I was paying upwards of $100+ for a ""professional"" one. I put this on my wish list and got it for Christmas and I use it ALL the time. I love it. For this price point you can't do a whole lot better. I've seen others say how flimsy it is and I fail to see where that's true. I mean I've put this thing through the paces too, slicing everything from potatoes to summer sausage to oranges. Is it absolutely perfect in each and every slice? No, but I'm not that OCD about it that I need it to be so picky! If you hold direct, firm pressure to whatever you are slicing it does it even. It's when you don't apply even pressure to the whole item that you get uneven slicing. I just cut a whole bag of garlic with it (so I could roast them and not have to try to awkwardly cut off the tops with the papery skins with a knife that inevitably rolls) and again, it didn't let me down. I'd say for the money, this is a great place to start."
3,Worthy successor to Eclipse of the Kai,"The immediate sequel to Eclipse of the Kai, The Dark Door Opens builds onto the storyline of its predecessor. The writing cannot compare too well against the later books in the series, when John Grant has a firmer foothold with this line, but there are some memorable moments. The tension-charged confrontation between Vonotar the Traitor and the Guildmaster, the firestorm attack upon the city of Toran, and the flight to Holmgard are highlights of this book."
3,No increase in mpg.,I did not notice an increase in MPG. Upside is I won't have to buy filters often. I will save money too.
2,K&N performance air filter,I bought this filter hoping to have improved fuel consumption on my 2001 Toyota Sienna. I have not seen any changes in fuel consumption nor increase in horse power. I will save money on having to purchase a new filter every 15000 miles and thus save landfill space.
3,Does the job,"I have not yet noticed increased power or fuel mileage, but it's only been a week. For the price it better improve."
5,"New or Used car, Replace With K&N.","Wheather you have bought a New or Used gas saving car, Improve it even more with the K&N air filter. Huge noticeable gain in MPG in one full tank. I did when I Installed in my 98 camry."
3,"saves money in replacing filters, does nothing for gasmileage","I have used a K&N filter in my jeep for years. It saves money as I do not have to replace the filter but can simply clean it and put it back in. These filters by themselves have a negligible influence on engine power and do absolutely nothing to improve gas mileage. The airflow increases at the expense of filtering capability. You can not have higher flow without sacrificing your ability to filter out contaminants. However, regular oil changes should compensate for having more dust enter your engine. Anyone thinking your gasmileage improves are deluding themselves, if anything, higher airflow means an INcrease in gas usage as the engine computer now has to feed more gas to keep the same air/gas ratio."
3,Artistic View of Borneo's Rain Forrest.,"I purchased this book because I am planning a trip to Borneo and I wanted to learn more about the Borneo rain forest. The book is very well done. The photographs are very artistic and beautiful. Some of the creatures I have never seen before. However, I was disappointed that art took presidence over instruction. I did not learn as much about the plants and animals of the rain forest as I had hoped. If you are looking for an atlas or encyclopedic report keep looking."
1,Way too small!,The 16x24x1 filters that I received were lacking nearly a half an inch in both length and width. Life's too short to be duct-taping other people's shoddy products.
2,Not much help in finding shark teeth or other fossils,"This book is essentially a poor photocopy of a poor manual. There are only about 2 pages that have anything to do with finding shark teeth. The photos are of very poor quality and the book is in need of some proof reading. Several ""plans"" for making your own fossil hunting equipment are included in this book, but they are incomplete and the photo quality is no help."
1,wrong,"Yeah he pitches his tent everywhere, I'm sure. There are more than a few ways to skin a cat, and there is a broad range for a physical symbol-computation system to develop. The brain is one way, computers are another. Consciousness is merely a causal network, which can be replicated. Anything beyond that is talk of magic."
1,One of the worst history books I've read,"I bought this book on a whim a few weeks ago and, after struggling to get past the first 50 pages, recently just returned it. In the bookstore I found the book to be interesting due to the great illustrations and accompanying text. But the actual book is another matter entirely. It's divided into several essays written by different authors. I wish I could remember who wrote the first one, because I would warn Irish history enthusiasts to steer clear of that author's other books.What bothered me was how the book begins by skipping over thousands of years of history to bring the reader into around 500-700 AD, with the clear implication that before the arrival of Christianity, nothing too interesting happened on the island. Beyond that, the first essay reads like a super-boring recitation of place names, people and titles that are barely explained. Awful, just awful."
2,YAWN,"I started reading this book after finishing ""A Concise History of Scotland"" and this one paled by comparison. The book about Scotland was a masterpiece of cohesion and interesting writing. Unfortunately, the only thing the two books have in common are the great illustrations.The illustrations in this book about Irish history are the ONLY interesting thing, in my opinion, and the writing never lives up to that quality. It is just one dry fact after another--- so unappealing. Where is the humanity--the people, the cultures, the societies? History should be written in the same vital way in which it occurred.What a shame--this could have been such a good book if the writing had had any life to it."
2,monotonous,the writers take it for granted that the reader is already well versed in irish history. if anyone knows of a good book on irish history: please let me know!
5,COLOSSAL!,"Crystal Lake Memories is one of the best books about film in my collection (and I have a lot of them). The interviews and behind-the-scenes photographs reveal info that even the biggest Friday the 13th fan would not find anywhere else before this book. Highly, highly entertaining and recommended!"
4,Fantastic book on unworthy subject,"This book is almost like a ""how-to-get-rich-making-bad-movies"" manual. The author covers every aspect of all F13th movies up to and including Freddy vs. Jason. Each chapter represents one of the movies, and by the end, you're a little exhausted with the book as many stories are repeated with different players. But that's not the fault of the author--it's just that production is sometimes as tedious as the F13 movies themselves. The layout is magnificent and any horror fan will love the photos and graphics. This tired, worn-down film series really does not deserve such a great book, but a great book it is. Obviously no F13 fan should be without it. (And unfortunately some or all typos that reviewers complained of from the first edition are still present.)"
5,HAPPY FRIDAY THE 13TH!!!,"Today is a great day because it's Friday the 13th and an awesome remake came out today! This book is very interesting that has hundreds of behind the-scenes pictures of every Friday the 13th movie! It has interviews, and stories from the actors and directors. If you love the Friday the 13th series, you'll love CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES: THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF FRIDAY THE 13TH!!!"
4,"Great Price, Good Book","""T. Houston"" below really nailed it. It's a really cool book, but they advertised some things that basically aren't true. Most notably the ""cut scenes"", which they pump up pretty heavily on the website. These deleted scenes are like the Holy Grail for 13th fans, especially from the first 3 or 4 films. There are essentially NO pictures or images of any of those deleted scenes. And, as Mr. Houston also points out, a LOT of the text was previously available in various magazines and interviews. However, with all that said, it's still a really cool book. It's beautifully designed and laid out, and for $26, it's a steal. If you're a Friday the 13th fan, it's a no-brainer."
5,Very Good,"This book is amazing.I can see why it took the author 3 years to write-- a terrific job putting this book together. If you love the Friday movies, this book is a must have on your reading list."
1,Fun with blue lips,"This book is edible paper and an edible ink pen. It does work. You can write or draw on the ""paper"" and then eat it. You can truly ""eat your words."" This edible notepaper does have some interesting potential uses. Fun too.But, the dark ink does stain your tongue and mouth and lips. It takes a lot of scrubbing to remove the ink. Not too cool if you have to go to work or school the next day.I used it to make edible place names for dinner. The place names were the first course. However, the guests were not pleased with the colorful results. There should be a warning somewhere in the instruction book. But there isn't. So be warned."
4,Good Topics that need to be talked about,I liked this book and it was good for my boyfriend and I to go through at different times during our relationship. The book brought up important topics that need to be discussed before you make the committment of marriage. The book brought up some very touchy subjects between us and also started some heated discussions but it ultimately brought us closer together which is what we needed. We don't have everything figured out of course but we are steps closer to having a good solid foundation to our relationship which will carry over to our marriage.
4,Headed for a Wedding,I like this book a lot! So far this is the best one I have read with my future husband. We had a hard time getting through these types of books before because we have been dating for quite sometime (5 years) and know a ton about each other. This book has helped us communicate more effectively and brought us through some tough issues. We have learned more about each other and we both really enjoy it. The dates are fun and simple and adaptable. This book has brought us closer together and enhanced our relationship. I would def. recommend it to any engaged/ almost engaged couple.
4,Would Highly Recommend.,"Great Purchase! I want to buy this book for my friends who are in serious relationships and newly married too! If you have the right mindset going into it that yes, although these are ""date"" nights yet you still will be having serious conversations...some which might be a little more tense than others. Ultimately though, they are things that should and need to be discussed before taking your relationship to the next level. My boyfriend and I have really enjoyed even the ritual of setting a specific time each week to have uninterruped time together. I'm so glad I bought this book."
4,Slow moving gory goodness,"I love Fulci. I've been a fan of him for as long as I can remember and a fan of horror films even longer than that. I expected a lot out of this film and it sorta kinda delivered. It took me a couple of times to get through it, not because I couldn't handle the gore or anything lame like that, I just couldn't get into the story the way I should have. It's an enjoyable little piece that has pacing problems, but if you're a fan of either Fulci or horror or both, you're still in for a treat."
3,Fulci in the Brain,"Lucio Fulci has always managed to play some sort of bit part in most of his movies, but I am kinda sure this is the first film that he is the featured character. In Cat in the brain;Fulci plays himself, he is a horror director that needs to do something else but horror films for a while. He keeps seeing strange horrible images everywhere he goes,(The movie utilizes a lot of gore scenes from other Fulci films.) The Psychiratrist he goes to for help hypnotizes him to kill with relish, and a lot of ketchup. Totally recomended to Fulcifans everywhere,everyone else should be very cautious, or steer clear of this movie and anything by Lucio Fulci"
3,Movie,"Not recevied this item yet so I am unable to give a review I""m sure I will be pleased once it arrives"
3,Fulci's 8 1/2,"I like Lucio Fulci but don't think he's a genre god like some fans do, so I kind of enjoyed Cat in the Brain. It's sort of a comedic 8 1/2 with Fulci playing himself and doing a pretty decent job of it. The plot is completely silly and most of the gore spliced in from other Fulci movies, so it's obvious he wasn't taking this very seriously. This DVD should be a must-have for Fulci completists who own the Region 2 full-frame version. The extras alone are worth the upgrade. A good film? Nah! A fun trifle? Definitely."
1,Pages and pages of ads!,"I'm a fan of other Time Out guidebooks, particularly Time Out's Eating and Drinking in Rome, but this book is a huge disappointment.First, the type is so tiny that it's difficult to read.Second, the book is filled with advertisements - not just one or two but at least a hundred. This makes the book seem no better than the cheap guides you find for free in many hotel rooms.Third, in checking out just two things, I've found two errors. Ever hear of 22 volt electricity? That's what this book says runs in Argentina. (Correct voltage is 220 volts.)Another error is in giving the wrong page number for information about Teatro Colon. You are directed to page 198 which informs you instead about gay life in Buenos Aires. (The information about Teatro Colon is actually on page 204.)So, do I trust any other information in this book? Nope! Will I bother carrying this book with me to Buenos Aires? Absolutely not!"
5,I love this guide!,"After searching through many guidebooks, I settled for TimeOut, and let me tell you, I am glad that I did.This book gave me everything I needed to know about beautiful Buenos Aires. The places that my Argentine friend recommended to me were all listed in this book, so that shows you how good it is!Definitely must buy this before going to Buenos Aires, or Argentina itself. Great read, great pictures, great food in Argentina! :)"
2,"Poorly Written, Bad Maps","This guide does not come close to comparing with Lonely Planet. It is poorly written and gives little or no information about museums and city sites other than their address and hours of operation. The map is also poorly done and it is difficult to use in locating restaurants and museums. Buenos Aires is an amazing city so I suggest buying a worthy guide book, not this one."
4,Una profundización en los conflictos de sur africano,"Minter ha escrito una obra larga y con mucha atención a las causas y consecuencias de lo sucedido en el Sur de África desde finales del siglo XIX hasta 1994, este dato es importante no olvidarlo. Por la fecha de su publicación Minter no llegó a ver todas ni la mayoría de las consecuencias, pero es una obra imprescindible, creo yo, cuando se trata de conocer algo el panorama que se vivía en los países vecinos de Sudáfrica. Quizá el fallo es que se escora con cierta frecuencia hacia posiciones anti sudafricanas, pese a que trata de evitarlo."
2,Not worth the dollars...,I was very disappointed when this product arrived. I could have saved money if I ordered a regular size cd. Not only is this overpriced but it has a low writing speed. Don't buy it- it's not worth the money.
2,Opposites Attract?,"If you're a fan of Orthrelm's earlier work, be forewarned: 'OV' is the antithesis of everything that came before it. This stuff is about as minimalistic and anti-progressive as it gets. There is something to be said for musical expansion or ""branching out"", but this one left me frustrated and a bit dumbfounded. Proceed at your own risk."
4,Pretty Sandal,"I wear this sandal and get compliments. The leather is hard and feels uncomfortable at times but after an additional year, it might soften up."
3,not a gift book,"I ordered this as a gift for a nursing instructor, but was disappointed. It was not as inspiring or moving as I expected, but rather just page after page of short bios of very nice nurses. It wasn't a bad book, just a little boring. And too expensive for boring. I only read a handful and then returned it."
2,Got bored with it pretty fast.,"I put this one to bed after just a few weeks. Sorry to say (because I hate those boneheads who say, ""This sucks."")Great hooks and some clever lyrics, and a very nice voice. But the overall effect is of the songwriter trying too hard to write the ""perfect pop song."" The overall effect is that it's too tight and confined for its own good. There's a difference between going after the perfect pop song and just writing songs.In the end, there's not much new here. Nothing surprises. I wonder if anyone agrees with me in saying that what the Long Winters truly lack is ATTITUDE. All caps.Sorry, but we need a fewer pop stars reading and quoting books.Long Winters will be compared to Nada Surf who do the same perfect-pop-song thing. Instead try Matt Pond PA or Phoenix's second CD and get back to me later."
4,catchy,"This absolutely floored me with its catchiness. Great lyrics like ""Now I'm smoking cigarettes when no one else does"" and ""You never told me your secrets, so I guess they're still safe with me"" provide new novelties to enjoy after the initial catchiness of the music wears off. That's gonna take a while, because this is one of the catchiest cds I've heard all year. ""I like the old days, but not all the old days, only the good old days."" Great cd."
5,"My Brother, My Brother, and Me","I bought this album because of the Podcast My Brother, My Brother, and Me on the Maximum Fun podcast network. John Roderick is a great singer/songwriter who I've been enjoying a lot lately. He is good friends with Jonathan Coulton and John Hodgman. I can't get enough of those guys working together. I hope Mr. Roderick appears on a few more episodes of Judge John Hodgman."
3,Great Information . . . Poor Construction,"I acquired this book in paperback (not sure if it comes in hardbound) for an MFA pedagogy class. The information is great. However, the book is not bound well and the pages separated from the spine. Not one or two pages, but ALL of the pages. It's an excellent textbook with regard to the content/subject matter (I particularly liked the chapters on avoiding stress and theory). There are helpful author quotes and tips (Wendy Bishop and Peter Elbow). I keep my books to use as reference/resource material. This one will require special handling (maybe a rubberband or two). It gets ""five"" stars for content and ""two"" for construction. So, a ""three"" star rating overall."
3,okay,I have made about 22 or so disks. Not yet a single coaster made. This disk does get a little worse in picture quality toward the middle of the disk. BEWARE
1,Giant Corn Ball,"I found these movies to be particularly corny, lame, and massively unappealing. The whole thing just sucks, I don't know how else to put it. I am disappointed in myself for spending money on this. I think that even so-called 'B movie' fans will be disappointed in this. The acting is awful, the production value is beyond low, the special effects are downright perfidious. I mean its not even funny to laugh at how horrible this is. I am sure that whoever made these movies probably had a great time running around in their back yard pretending to fight off zombies, which is what I should have done instead of buying this pathetic excuse for entertainment. When they say 'don't judge a book by its cover,' I think is what they meant."
1,Just a fly on the wall,How ridiculous. It's amazing to me that anyone would believe this nonsense. This is obviously a man who is a legend in his own mind. I think he needs help. I am amazed that anyone reads this nonsense.
5,Love old rock and roll?? BUY THIS!!!,"Looking for old rock and roll?? Do you like songs from the 50's?? If you like NRBQ,you'll love this!!! The Morells do songs,aside from their own,by Tom T.Hall,Nick Lowe,Beach Boys and even the Ramones! A very fun and tight bar band..Why this group isn't more popular is beyond me!! Lots of obscure songs..all of them great!! Lots of familiar songs,too...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,An Animated Gem,"This animated ""A Christmas Carol"" is a gem from '69, and used to be shown every year until about the late '70s. Now that Rhino is distributing it on VHS, GET IT! Forty-five minutes in length, it is nicely drawn, told and fairly faithfully gives us the Dickens novella while losing little of the Victorian charm that graces the best film adaptions.While not as carefully crafted as the shorter cartoon from Richard Williams'/ Chuck Jones' version two years later, it is a great film to share with children.Merry Christmas!"
4,Wrong in so many of the right ways...,"SICK is a rock-solid antho. The sheer range of stories, from the directly, appallingly nasty shock of Sakowski's ""A Terrible Thing to Waste"" to the philisophical, Analog-type Dick-ery of Chambers' ""The Kind Old Fellow,"" makes this worth reading. Add on the range of literary experimentation that actually succeeds here and you've got the makings of an underground classic.I very seriously wish I would have skipped that Sakowksi story, though. Ed Lee fans and those who appreciate effective short fiction will dig it, but I don't know that I'll ever be willing to go under anesthetic again.Damn, that story's messed up."
3,Not terribly helpful,"I bought this because my outline was nowhere near finished near exam time, and I needed to put the material into some sort of perspective. I had never used a commercial outline before (other than as a supplement to check my own outline) and that could be why I was fairly disappointed by this outline. I didn't understand why they chose the cases they included in the outline, as they didn't seem that seminal to me. That being said, it was somewhat useful, though I don't really recommend it."
5,Very useful in class,"I am of Italian descent and wanted to learn the grammar, etc so that I could speak the language (which I forgot for many years) properly. I am taking Italian classses and we have used exercises from this book in class along with out textbook. It has been very useful."
5,Great book.,This book helped me to refresh my memory. I studied with this book before I took a state test in order to teach Italian. Thank you because I passed.
3,cockadoodledooooo,"""Roosters"" definitely had the potential to be a haunting piece of literature. Unfortunately, it loses quality as it turns into more of a dinner table type conversation for the entirety of the play, until the dramatic ending takes place. If you're looking for something to make you think, this could be the perfect play for you, or possibly the worst. The problem with ""Roosters"" is that the story is so ambiguous that you have to think and think about every single thing but you never quite get anywhere, because it doesn't seem that there really is actually any deeper meaning. However, if you are someone who indulges in analytical thought with no conclusion, have fun!"
3,Profound--but deeply complex and better off watched onstage,"First and foremost, Roosters is worth buying. I mean the play is only $7--a steal for the treasure trove of themes hidden in this little tome. A searing family saga exploring themes of morality, ownership, maturity, and the merit we all find in ourselves and each other. Also a fairly in depth exposition of cockfighting if thats something you are interested in learning about. Milcha Sanchez-Scott also incorporates a plethora of black humor--the banter is fast, free and realistic.If you are looking for a challenging but enjoyable read, invest in this meretricious piece of work.Oh sweet air!"
1,Extremely disappointed,"My six year old asked Santa for a sewing machine all year and she got it on Christmas morning. Her father, aunt (an accomplished seamstress) and I spent 3 days and nights trying to figure out how to simply pick up the bottom thread, with no success. It has never sewed. Right now it is sitting in a corner. I think she doesn't want to offend Santa by throwing it away. Really, really sad. Unfortunately, Santa does not keep receipts!!!!!"
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I'll give this thing 2 stars for teaching me never to buy a $13 sewing machine ever again. It doesn't sew, it just looks and sounds like it's trying to! The instructions are entirely inadequate (some words to go with pictures would help), there is no logical way to change the needle, the tension knob seems to be a joke, the plastic needle guard is a nice idea but seems to get in the way of the thread, it's too lightweight to stay put, and when I tried to find a manufaturer to call for help, there was none listed on the box or in the instructions. I'm incredibly disappointed, as is my daughter. After sewing for 15 years, I was really looking forward to teaching my daughter how to sew on such a cute child-sized machine that I believed would be perfect for her. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk!"
1,Poor quality,Instructions are horrible. They make no sense and steps contradict each other. Cannot even get it to work.
3,FRUSTRATED,"My daughter received this machine from her Grandparents for her birthday. She is able to sew on the machine and has actually sewn several squares together in an effort to make her first quilt. HOWEVER, I cannot figure out how to ""lock"" her stitches and the instructions on this subject, and overall, are TERRIBLE. I find myself having to hand-sew her last few stitches to get them to ""lock"". The machine is a good stepping stone for the real thing because it worked JUST WELL ENOUGH for us to know she is definitely interested and is careful enough to operate the real thing someday soon."
1,At least it was cheap,"Like many others, I got this for my daughter. In her case, she always asked to help me sew, and I thought this would make a nice stop gap until she was old enough for a real machine.Wrong. At first it wouldn't sew at all. With a bobin in, the needle was constantly hitting something. We took it apart and futzed with the timing. After that was fixed, we tried again... only to find that half the time, the bobbin thread wouldn't catch. I fiddled and futzed and messed with it, but I couldn't get the bobin thread to catch at all. I've been sewing for nearly 2/3 of my 35 years, so I know what I'm doing with a sewing machine.Fortunately it's now sold out. Unfortunately, I have a frustrated daughter and am back to sitting her on my lap as I sew.At least it was cheap, so I don't feel like I was out a lot of money. Just time and effort."
4,Wonderful,"I searched high and low for a childs sewing machine that would imitate mine. With no photo available I was very skeptical about the price, so low. Well after searching and not finding what I wanted I went ahead and ordered. I'm so happy I did, my daughter loves it (7) and her sister wants to use it to. It's durable and lots of fun. Very safe. GREAT."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"I'm a pretty good seamstress, and I know my way around a standard machine. But we got this gift for my 7 year old at Christmas, and yes, like everyone else said, it took a mind-boggling amount of time just to get the dang thing OUT of the box, and then use a screwdriver on EVERY dang little piece just to get it ready to sew.Instructions are terrible...hardly understandable.And I've fiddled with the tension knob for hours and hours, and can NOT get the thing to sew a neat stitch. Besides, the thread breaks after four or five stitches anyway, every time, every tension setting.My daughter is upset and frustrated, I'm upset and frustrated...can't believe Toys-r-us has put their name on this piece of JUNK. Save your money."
1,Waste of time,"As others have found, this is the worst piece of junk that I have ever seen. Shame on ToysRUs for even carrying it. It will be returned today, one day after purchase, after 2 accomplished seemstresses tried in vain to get it to work. Trash, pure trash, and a waste of good plastic. Stay away unless you want to feel like a sap for falling for it."
1,Don't buy this one!,"My daughter bought this for her daughter..She lost the instructions on how to thread the bobbin.. I sew..This is the hardest toy I have ever tried to figure out! My opinion, you want your child to sew? Let her learn to use your machine!"
1,Don't buy it!! NO STARS!,"I purchased THREE of these, 1 for my daughter and 1 each for two nieces. These girls are 10, 10, and 9. All of them were *so* excited to get to sew! It was a horrible waste of money. All three sewing machines were JUNK. They all went in the trash. There is not one thing or another about them that was wrong. Everything about them was horrible! Total waste. Better of spending $20 on the hand-operated sewing machine you see on T.V."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I thought this sewing machine would be a great beginner machine for my 9 year old daughter. My plan was to determine how much she enjoyed sewing & then perhaps get her a more advanced machine. Unfortunately this toy machine is just that: a toy. We were never able to actually get the machine to actually sew, though the needle moved up and down. The thread just knotted up every single time. The instructions were very poor also. We were both disappointed and ended up throwing the darn thing away after fooling with it for a few months. Bottom line: don't waste your money (...)."
1,Don't try it!,We bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. Santa couldn't get it to work forever and she sews all the time. Then my daughter couldn't get it to work for more than a few stitches. Finally gave up. The only good thing was that I decided she could use my machine and she sews on it. It was a complete waste.
1,Terrible!,"I got this sewing machine for Christmas, and when I tried to sew, it would not work. The cover for the needle is sopposed to make kids be safe, but in order to sew, you have to take it off. If you are looking for a kid sewing machine, do not get this one!"
4,Cool study of nexus 'tween folk remedies and science,"Although not being a medical or scientific type, I found this a fascinating book. Some of the behaviors described -- drinking urine or applying it to wounds, placing maggots on festering skin to draw out the dead and dying cells -- possess a horrid fascination for the lay reader, but the authors describe quite dispassionately the possible scientifically valid reasons behind them. Very interesting stuff."
1,Should not be shown to Children,"Sound quality , picture quality and performance are very good in this production by the Australian Opera Co. Most heart warming was the scene in which the children dreamed of their real mother,departed. Beyond that point this performance in flawed for 3reasons. One: The Dew Fairy scene is a mockery. Second: Displayedat the Witches home is a human hand sitting in the intake of amanual meatgrinder. Last: Instead of a magic wand or some otherdevice, the witch uses a large butcher knife to keep Gretel at bay viewed by Hansel prisoned in a cage. I waited for this DVD,in all reality will not play it for any children in my family norrecommed it. Definately in poor tast and should not be shown to children. I plan to return it and buy the older Met version on DVD which does not have these types of gruesome overtones."
4,"It's My Turn, November 12, 2000","This book is a good read which stirred many of my stray feelings while reading it. It is a courageous and unique story, deeply felt and multilayered. This is a great first novel for this author!"
3,My Husband Likes Them,"My husband likes these boxers but with repeated washing, they started to wear so thin that little tears appeared all over the fabric. Mostly on the back. I only put them in the washing machine a handful of times and I never put them in the dryer. The little rips are probably occurring because the fabric isn't very stretchy. Other then that, they're great."
4,Great for the couch surfer!,"I've been using this lap desk for at least a year and it has worked out well. My laptop heats up and is not comfortable without this desk. It's basciall a bag filled with styrofaom beads with a removable plastic desk top that can be wiped off or put in a dishwasher. I have one of the wider laptops and there is still a good 6 inches of room to one side.The cup holder is wide and really doesn't secure most cups. It does perfectly hold a beer in a koozie, which is pretty cool."
2,Wears out quickly,I've been using my laptop on the Lapp Topper daily since Feb 2006. It's now May and the foam beads are bunched up in one area of the lap desk and will not distribute evenly for a comfy fit. The board itself is no longer sturdy and bends in the middle. This product does not stand up to daily use.
2,Not for uninitiated,"If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae."
3,Spice 1 is back in 04,"Top Songs are-Work it out-""Cutthroat game""-Reckless Eyeballin-""Nature to ride""-Kiss my azz-""Pimp Pizzle""-""Thug World""-""U Gotta take it""wich features a verse from who I believe is 2Pac.-""Im a boss"".The Lyrics are pretty good the beats are better and on songs like Im a boss he displays a nice Flow.Lyrics 7/10 Production 8/10 X Factor-6/10 Classic 6/10 Replay 6/10 Total=6.5 out of 10 Fingers.Here are the Top 5 Songs1.Cutthroat Game2.Thug World f Kurupt3.U gotta take it4.Im a boss5.Nature to ride"
1,IT'S TIME 2 RETIRE,"I don't know what you other people be smokin but this album is weak SPICE fell off after the black bossalinie album in 97' the last dance was avarege but anything from 2000 on is garbage music has taken a nose dive for the worst and I highly doubt it will ever recover, and it's 2 bad SPICE had to go in the same direction as other artists in the game who in my opinion don't even deserve the title of ""ARTIST"" anymore becuase this is not music anymore it's recycled garbage, and it's very sad. So if you like this album you better get a hearing test and check yo self!!!!!"
4,Great for little lovers of The Little Mermaid,"I bought this doll for my toddler who has become obessed with The Little Mermaid! She loved it! She didn't mind that the voice was not that of the movie Ariel. The little girl's voice used was just as exciting! The little acessories were adores. My daughter really loved the little bag with the fork. She really connected what with the movie and pretended searching for items with her new Ariel.My only complaint (being a mommy) is the hair. It tangles easily-so I recmmend leaving it in it's netting. But, it doesn't matter my daughter loves playing with her and it inspires her to play and pretend. Overall, it was a great purchase and my daughter loves her."
5,Excellent toy for your little princess,"My daughter loves this doll. I highly reccomend it for any girl who loves princesses. It is a perfect huggable size and the hair is very pretty. The doll doesn't say a whole lot but my daughter, who is almost 3, doesn't mind a bit as she loves the sweet song she sings. She is very durable. She received her as an incentive present for potty training. Very motivating."
3,"Many forms, some good, some bad","While the forms are not designed too well, the content is very useful. For a small company, we've been able to adapt many for our own use. The book is very expensive, but worth it"
1,Out of date information!,This book has out of date permit information as we found out. It says you can dayhike Whitney without a permit. We drove all the way from LA up to the Mt. Whitney Ranger station in Lone Pine only to find out that a permit IS needed for a dayhike and they were all taken. The book has out of date info about backpacking as well. It spends more pages on how to buy out of date hiking gear than on current permit information. We were very upset by the information this book provided.
5,Finding the Balance in your Breath Guided Meditation,"Jeanie has done a fine job on this Meditation CD. She has a soothing voice and guides you through the meditation, just sit back and quietly listen to her. I have listened to it several times and each time it brings a new balanced awareness to me. I would highly recommend this CD to everyone. I purposely listened to this one because ""Balance"" is what I needed at the time and it certainly has helped me achieve that goal."
2,Not so pleased,"The product might, probably works. However the smell is really horrific. Added to that is the fact that the recommended dosage is eight, yes 8, capsuls a day. This product has definite problems."
3,Decent Lessons,Not a bad product by any means but I really didn't know what to expect from beginning lessons on a cd.
3,Hard to navigate,"Hard to navigate, goes very fast paced. My niece did not understand it. Bought her a Guitar lesson for dummies book also that was better for a young teen."
2,Very superficial introduction to learning the guitar,Instruction DVD was as good as it went. However that wasn't very far. Brief into to guitar parts followed by some simple songs that could be played with about a half dozen chords that it taught. I was able to go through the whole DVD in a couple of hours and I'm just a beginner.
3,not bad,"kind of confusing for a new player, the sounds are good but it is a little confusing. but it is not a bad program."
2,Get a Moulinex instead,"The best hand grater ever made is a metal, hand cranked grater by a French company called Moulinex. The grater is called a Mouli and is available on eBay. It comes with 4 or 5 metal wheels, and does a superb job.Highly recommended."
5,Needed some bronze sandles,I put my foot in this shoe and it felt like i had some soft flippers on. i was so happy with them i walked around the house with them on.
5,Clean,"I received this one as a present and I loved itat first spray. It has a clean, fresh scent.It lasts all day. Everyone makes a commentabout it after they're done sniffing me.It atracts a lot of people, they're happyto get on the elevator with me, and stand close.Don't spray too much because it is strong."
1,Anyone want something lacking flavor???,"I was disgusted by this ""hot chocolate"". You MUST use it with milk - using water is by far the most disgusting thing I have ever tried to drink. Even with the warm milk - you need several extra scoops of this to make it taste even okay. It was a TOTAL waste of money. I dontaed the other 3 cans to the food pantry.There is no flavor to it - just makes the milk kind of greasy until you add about 5 or 6 scoops - then you get at least a chocolate flavor. Being that I LOVE Ghirardelli chocolate bars I expected soemthing MUCH better than this garbage."
2,MAKE THIS WITH MILK!!!!,"I just received my shipment, and I was so excited to try it. I poured my hot water in, took a sip, and BLEH! Yuck. I came on the website to blast this hot chocolate and give it a poor review, but then read some of the reviews that mention how it NEEDS TO BE MADE WITH MILK. I didn't even read the instructions, because I've always used water in any other h.c. mixes I've bought. I remade it with milk, which made it better, but I still like Stephens hot cocoa more. It's delicious & creamy & you can make it w/water. I'm definitely going back to Stephens."
5,Delicious hot cocoa!,I took an advice from a reviewer to only use half of what's recommended to make hot cocoa. We only use 2 table spoonful of this mix with milk. It's very delicious! My kids love it!
4,Pretty good stuff,Not the best but it is still highly rated in my book. A little sweeter than I usually like it but it is also a little cheaper than some of the others.
4,good product,The hot chocolate was good. It does taste a little powdery if you put too much of the powder in it. Can't beat made from scratch but it's better than the other hot chocolate powder I have try.
1,Not sweet,"Rich dark chocolate but not sweet at all. If you like hot chocolate from restaurants or theme parks like Disneyland, avoid this. As a person who loves Ghiradelli Ice Cream and chocolate candy, I was extremely disappointed."
4,A little too sweet,"I've been a Godiva Hot Chocolate fan for quite a long time, but I decided to try something new. It's very creamy and rich and my family seems to like it, but it's a little too sweet for me. If you prefer something a little less sweet try Godiva."
1,So sweet I could gag,"Ghirardelli should be a fine chocolate product, but this cocoa when used according to directions is so sweet it's sickening. I tried using less, then there was no chocolate flavor. This should be a better quality product in keeping with the name -- cut down the sugar, and more chocolate folks!No complaints with Amazon -- package arrived in good shape."
5,rich and yummy,"I reviewed all the hot chocolates before purchasing Ghiardellis. I was not dissapointed. It is everything I expected, rich and chocolaty."
3,Taste just like melted chocolate,This tastes just like you melted a Ghiradelli candy bar and are drinking it. It does not taste like Cocoa. My 12 and 15 yr olds do not like it. I think it taste good. If you want hot cocoa taste this is not for you though.
3,Doesn't feel like hot chocolate but okay.,"Just some milk powder, but doesn't make a good hot chocolate. Thinking how to consume all four. But okay can drink."
5,Great for coffee and makes a rich hot cocoa,"I don't like the hot cocoa mixes that include sugar, milk solids, milk chocolate and ingredients I can't pronounce. Ghiradelli Double Chocolate is my go to choice. I like adding it to my coffee instead of sugar... and it makes a very rich, delicious cup of hot cocoa. I was nervous to try it based on some of the reviews, but now it's the only hot cocoa we use. High recommended."
5,Totally worth the price!,Best hot chocolate! Doesn't compare to the packages that you mix with water. This is awesome.
2,Awwww. Sh.....t,"This product causes thoughts about that old saying, ""One Aww-Shoot Cancels Ten Attaboys"".Two of the four canisters in the shrink wrapped package were cracked - the ingredients are tasteless! All and all though, ordering from this company over the years allows for one flaw. Up until this order arrived everything received here from Amazon has been stupendous!Guess this one bad item was overdue and I'm just going to throw it away.I'll continue to buy here and from experience bet there will another dozen or more years before I'm disappointed again.Really, thanks Amazon for everything else."
1,way too much sugar and too little cocoa bean,"If you had a real hot chocolate in Europe before tasting the rich aroma of cocoa beans and were lucky enough to try some of the ready made cocoa mixes from Switzerland or Germany (e.g. from companies like Hachez, Lindt, Movenpick) than this Double Chocolate product from Ghirardelli is a bitter disappointment. It is way too sweet (too much sugar) and has too little cocoa beans in it (to maximize profits). I am almost done with one of the 16oz tins and will not buy this product again nor can I recommend it. Too be quite frankly honest, it is not just Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix that is too sweet, it is pretty much impossible to find a good-quality-lower-in sugar-and-richer-in-cocoa hot cocoa mix in the States. And no, I am not willing to pay 12 bucks for a hot cocoa tin from Godiva, that is a rip off."
2,Nice but very expensive,I did not realize how small the containers were. This is very expensive drinking chocolate. I like it; my wife does not. I am happy to enjoy the regular Nestle drinking chocolate for a fraction of the cost. I cancelled my repeat order.
3,Overly sweet and rich,"First, let it be known I'm a chocoholic and long time Ghiradelli lover. I always have a gigantic bag of their 60% cacao chips on hand for snacking on and baking with. I also enjoy the Ghiridelli shop in the gas light area of San Diego when there on business. Mama mia that place smells so delicious! However, this particular hot coco mix is simply too rich and overly sweet. Almost on the undrinkable side of things. My kids actually dislike it for this reason and prefer Swiss Miss packets. Reviews here indicate it's good for making cafe mochas mixed with coffee, but I haven't tried that yet."
4,really is like drinking a chocolate candy bar,"I ordered this because it got voted on yahoo top 5, It is chocolate but I guess I like a cocoa flavor better, too rich for me, It really was like drinking a chocolate candy bar. so it is 4 stars if that's what you want, just not my taste. plus I didn't realize you had to add milk not water to mix. So I still will keep some of the cheap stuff around in case I don't have milk in the house, I'm sure my great nieces will Luv this since they are 8 & 9 yrs old."
4,Great taste,"I like this hot cocoa mix a lot. The taste is better than what you usually get at the office or grocery store, which shouldn't come as a surprise for a Ghirardelli product. It's a bit expensive, but it's worth it in my view."
5,Thick and rich,"It makes a thick and rich hot cocoa. If it is too sweet as some suggest, try a bit less."
5,heaven,Ghirardelli Double chocolate cocoa mix is sooooooo good ! Its not as convenient as regular cocoa mix because you have to use MILK for this cocoa but the taste is worth the effort. Yumm
5,Delicious!,"If you love hot chocolate, this is the one to try. Might seem a bit price but definitely worth it. We especially like the Double Chocolate because taste a bit more like dark chocolate. I make it with 2% milk but only use half the amount of cocoa mix suggested on the label and still taste plenty chocolate. A tablespoon in coffee makes a nice treat on a cold afternoon. Enjoy!"
5,Happy Tummies,Yummy. The whole family loves it.No other will dol. We even take it to the beach with us.thanks
3,better packing required,"The hot chocolate itself is super yummy which is why I went to the trouble of ordering it from here. Unfortunatly the packaging was not sufficient, and 3 of the 8 containers were busted. Amazon did give me a refund for half, but it was a real pain cleaning the dust off of the remainder, especially since some we gifts."
3,Hot Cocoa,"According to mixing instructions, it must be made with milk. A little on the bitter side. Very fine texture, mixes well."
3,Good hot chocolate.,"This hot chocolate was pretty good. Unfortunately, I've been spoiled by the much more expensive and MUCH better tasting Godiva hot chocolate."
2,Not awesome,"I am a chocolate lover, but I just didn't think this tasted very good. We've tried lots of different combinations of milk and more or less mix with it, but it always tastes too rich. It's not as sweet as I would have hoped. We didn't even finish a whole can of it. We'll probably just give the other 3 cans away. I usually love Ghirardelli products, but this was not a favorite."
4,Nice Dark Chocolate Mix,"The mix blends very well. However, it is not as sweet as I like my hot chocolate. But this is still enjoyable and warms me up on cold winter nights."
4,Bobbi Smith does it again...,I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the twist in the plot. The action was incredible. The love of a good woman can always turn around a man bent on ruining his life because of prior love. Read and enjoy.
2,look at region and language before buying,"Make sure you get English version of Access Denied, no matter how much it cost. the version I got was in German."
3,can the issue be resolved,"What can be done to reduce the odor? I wonder lso if it can be harmful to my senior dog. Also, can this be secured in a vehicle for travel?"
5,A Minnesota opinion,"I've only had the crate a couple of days but the experience has been entirely positive. I didn't sense a significant smell. My dog, who spends nights and also often time when I am not home, in the crate seems to like it as well as the hard sided crate she had been using. And it folds up in a breeze.I only wish I had bought it before I took a long driving trip recently so I could have avoided the cumbersome dragging in and out of motels of the hard sided and space hogging crate I did use.My dog (an English Springer Spaniel) likes the crate, is perfectly calm in it and never tries to chew so that was not an issue for us."
3,"Could make the mesh ""even more durable"".","This crate is great, but could be more durable for large dogs. It folds very flat and can slide under my back bench seat in the van. I didn't notice any ""smell"" when I received it like other people have commented on. It is very light weight and the carry handle is handy. It collapes and sets up with ease. It is not ugly. My only complaint is that the mesh, which has been advertised as improved to be more durable needs a second look. I have a 90 lb dog that is crate trained and pretty calm. For a dog that size, if he simple snags a nail on the mesh to test it, it rips. If he happens to make a small hole, that hole is a weak point for further damage. I would be willing to pay more for a product exactly like this that has a more expensive, very durable material used in the mesh. I have a feeling I'll be mending it a lot. I've had it for a two months and he's already ripped it twice with occasional use."
4,Love it!,I bought the N2-21 for my 6lb dog. She is a nervous wreak in the car. I bought this crate as a replacement to a dog car seat I used. She hated using the car seat and would constantly try to jump out of the seat. So I decided to look into a crate to use in my car. I wanted one that broke down easily and was light weight. I found this crate. Its perfect for the car. She is still nervous but she isn't trying to escape. I feel better knowing she is secure in the crate.
3,Terrible for Pups or Young Dogs,"This is a wonderful Product.. Just not for a dog who is going to Paw at the mesh.. Also a pee'er.. WOuld smell it up and not allow you to sanitize it as a metal crate can be... A Super Sweet lady brought this crate for a rescue dog.. He's here with me as is the crate.. He eventually settled into, but as soon as the kittens came out and he got exited.. ONe swipe and he put a hole in the mesh.. he also greeted it with a leg lift.. This is such a wonderful product IF you have a dog that was crate trained already.. and want to move to something cozy for them.. something warm for the winter.. A metal crate you can put a nice cushiony bed in it.. they can also get more air and feel like they are next to you, I've had the best success crate training my pets.. this is not a tool but a luxury item.. just remember that.. Now I dread telling her, He put a rip in the thing.. UG."
4,Quality easy to set up crate,I bought this crate to use on vacation and it was easy to pack and set up and is quality made.
5,perfect home,This krate is light weight yet durable and my dog loves it. It works great for travel too.
1,Destroyed in two days.,"I bought this product from Petsmart a couple of months ago. We used it on our 55 pound Lab and she was able to shred the zipper on both sides. She was crate trained prior but tried and was able to get out of this, destroying both doors in the process. I think it might be okay for smaller dogs, but I wouldn't really recommend it, its to poorly constructed."
2,Great if your dog doesn't move,"This crate tends to collapse inward on the dog. The frame that should ""snap"" into place needs something to slip over the joint so it can't collapse. Very little movement can cause the frame to collapse. The mesh is also rather flimsy - she is not a destructive dog, but just a few scratches resulted in large tears in the mesh almost immediately."
3,Very Basic and it Smells,"I use a soft crate to hold my 65lb Lab and my 26lb Blue Heeler at agility trials. This crate replaced a torn BP Backyard Pet crate that I'd used for 5 years and could nolonger find. Having used the Firstrax N2-36 several times now I'm sorry I bought it. There is an unpleasant chemical smell in it, and it doesn't seem any better built than my previous crate whick cost about half the price. The lack of a mesh section on top and better re-inforcement at the bottom of the front and side is dispointing."
4,I own 3 NOZTONOZ,"I do like this product and would recommend. Though, I think some people might find difficulty sliding the bars into lock or unlock, depending on their fingers (like arthritis). I've not had any problems with mine, and I like that it is sturdy. I would say that NOZTONOZ needs to keep the quality ""up"" in this product so that the bars work with ease. I think that my newest crate compared to the older ones has slightly thinner plastic slides. Lessening any quality into the crate will not be beneficial. I would pay a few dollars more for keeping up good quality! Yes, I would buy another."
5,very nice for my dog,"This soft crate is sturdy enough and with a large window for air for my small corgi dog. I found it easy enough to carry, fold and open. My dog took to it right away and I like the large window side so she can see out the front and side. A bit pricey but I like it."
2,Great concept but still smells after one month,"Great concept for a dog crate - really does set-up in seconds!! Problem is, like a few other reviews, the petroleum odor did not go away even after a month of being set-up. I contacted Firstrax for a solution on how to remove the smell and their advice was to put it outside. Problem is I don't have a yard to put it in, plus if you need to put it outside to get rid of the smell something is wrong with the product. I followed up my phone call to Firstrax with an e-mail but they have not replied.5-stars for the crate1-star for the smell"
2,stinky,"This crate is easy to set up but it smells horrible. I am not willing to expose my puppy to pvc outgassing.I tried to let it air out for a few days, but it has not helped. yuck.I am going to return this and get a metal crate which I can make cozy for her. this thing must be toxic!"
1,Literally - it stinks!,"It's a fantastic crate. Except for one problem - it stinks! Received this more than two weeks ago - sets up very easily. Seems very sturdy and would be great for traveling which is what my wife and I wanted it for. To take our yellow lab on trips with us this summer. Unfortunately, within an hour of having it in the house, my wife developed a headache and started feeling sick to her stomach. The smell was unbearable. The dog won't go near it. We read through some of the reviews and tried all the suggestions except for washing it in the washing machine. Wanted to be able to return it if necessary. We set it outdoors, sprayed it with Febreeze, wiped it down with vinegar, etc etc etc. Still stinks. Horrible horrible chemical odor. Sad to do it but we are returning it. Going to be nervous about buying another one online without being able to smell it first!"
4,Great crate,"As another reviewer states, it does have some weird chemical smell to it. Be careful when you machine wash and use the ultra gentle cycle. The material will easily break and peel otherwise. I had to return my first one due to that problem.It does not come with any padding, so I grabbed an assortment of the west paw mats suggested above. N2-30 and the medium size mats work together well.In the end, my dog loves it and that's what really matters. I'm just hoping that smell isn't something toxic... I trust amazon won't sell something harmful but it is made in china so I'm wary."
1,odor problem in Petnation Port a Pet by same company,Bought the similar model Petnation Port a Pet at Costco. Horrible petro chemical odor problem that wouldn't wash out. I took the item back to Costco. Do not recommend it.
4,Good but a little lower workmanship than its predecessor,"This purchase was based on the purchase I had made by Firstrax approximately 12 years ago of the same size soft crate. I use them to transport a forty pound dog in Suv, as well as set up when we are away from home. I am reasonably pleased with purchase; but find it a bit lower in quality, and without the zippered case that it can be stored in; which the prior purchase included. But all-in-all, I find this the best portable soft crate that I could find in this price range."
4,4 stars for now...,"i feel like this will be a 5 star as soon as i have a reason to use it. bought it as a 2nd crate/travel crate instead of hauling her metal wire crate. have been waiting for it to drop to less than $60 from amazons warehouse, bought it ""used"" with potential packaging damage. nothing was wrong with the packaging or crate that i'm aware of. soooo easy to setup and love all the entrys (top/side/front)"
5,Love This,This has been a perfectly wonderful crate for us. I travel a lot with my working dogs and they do very well in this. The large size gives them plenty of room to get comfortable. But it's light and easy to carry once folded down. High quality materials and construction. I bet it will last us a very long time.
5,Makes life easy,I have had mine for quite awhile now and love the ease of folding it down as well as its light weight design(also has a handle for easy carry). Washable cover is also a plus. Now I use it at competitions instead of my heavy metal x-pens and metal crates. Currently used by my dogs at home instead of the hard crate so I am able to bring there comfort zone w/ us as needed. This works for anyone who has to travel w/ there dog .
5,"A Pet Home, Not a ""Crate""","A crate is something you ship something in, or pack something in. If you love your dog or cat as much as I love my husky (and I know you do), then buy them this aptly named ""Pet Home"". The NOZTONOZ Sof-Krate (oops, there's that crate word again) will make you and your pet very happy. I have purchased (2), one for my husky, and one for my sister's lab. My dog has been using her's for three years now as the primary home den. If you know Siberian Huskies, then you know that they are rugged pups that can be really hard on their ""furniture"". Well, so far my little girl has not been able to put a scratch on this doghouse. Very easy to set-up. Folds-up nicely (although mine is always set-up). Quality build, design, and materials all around. I have found that LLBean medium sized dog beds fit perfectly in the N2-36 model and make an absolutely great combination. Highly recommended.Jimmy"
1,Toxic smelling crate,"So, I love the construction of the crate. However, was hoping to use it next week when our sweet dog stays with a friend while we are out of town. The overpowering, toxic smelling fabric, makes me afraid to use it. Thus it rates a 1. Our dog has so far refused to go near it. We have been airing it out for just 2 days, but don't see the fume-like odor dispersing anytime soon. It is so bad that I am concerned for the dogs health if she sleeps in it. She is a rescue and we don't want to poison her!!! If carpet off-gassing will give people a headache, I can't imagine what this would do to a 30 pound animal. We will probably return it when we get home. Such a shame as the sturdy but light construction is fantastic and just what we wanted. Bummer!"
1,Heavy duty mesh?,I purchased the medium size (up to 50 lbs dog) and my 7 lbs yorkie broke through this kennel in less than 5 minutes twice! Once by separating the zipper and the second time by scratching through the mesh. So if your dog wants out get a hard kennel.
1,horrible,Great size crate good looking and everything but if you have a dog that wants out they will get out. My 10lbs poodle broke the clip that holds the zipper up and now she can unzip it when ever she wants.
3,Not for all dogs,This crate certainly has a lot of good features. Its light weight and makes for a nice safe place for the dog to ride in the car - and my dog loved it for that. In the house she was crated in a durable plastic crate and that had been fine. One day i decided to try this crate in the house. I left for less than an hour - she destroyed it - she only weighs 26 lbs.
4,GREAT CRATE!,"This crate is very easy to set up, yet the construction is durable. Our two medium sized dogs ride in this crate in our vehicle, and both have plenty of room to lay down. A big plus for this crate is the door on the top. While traveling, this door allows easy access for petting, treats, etc.. Great mesh panels for visibility and ventilation. The only thing that would make this crate perfect is if it had roll up/down privacy flaps over the mesh panels. There are times when privacy flaps have a calming effect on the dog--such as close crating at a dog obedience event. Even without the privacy flaps, I have just ordered this same crate in a different size!"
4,"Love it, except that my puppy can get out...","I should have named my lab puppy Houdini. She is just 9 weeks old but gets out of everything, including this kennel. I love the look of the kennel, how easy it is to clean, collapse, and all the windows. While house training the pup, we have her kennel inside a space encircled by a baby gate. While in the kennel, she will find where the zipper is on the outside of the door and paw at that spot until it loosens. Then she pushes the zipper down and she's out...only to be stopped by the baby gate, which she climbs over. Sigh. We have tried securing the zipper with random things, but she claws at the screen so vigorously that I worry she will rip it and/or she has still managed to get out. So, with that said...I've got to find a more secure kennel for her. She's not to the point where we can trust her to run around the house, especially while we're sleeping. I think we'll be able to use this kennel again when she's older."
5,finally my puppy can ride in the car...,"I had initially planned to allow my puppy to ride freely in the car, in the backseat between my 2 kids. I would lay a blanket down and he stayed there the entire time. It was all great except for one MAJOR problem, he puked every single time he rode in the car, even if just a couple blocks. He seemed full of anxiety, immediately was yawning and breathing quickly as if he was nervous before I even started the car. I talked to our vet and friends about it, they recommended crating him in the car, especially since he is crated trained at home. They also recommended dramamine. We decided to try both and it's been like a miracle. He seems so much more relaxed, is no longer seeming anxiety ridden and thankfully the puking has stopped. We just traveled 3 hours in the car each way and he slept peacefully in his crate the entire time. Great purchase!"
3,Great at first but 2 years later my dog broke through the fabrick.,"I can't complain too much cause it lasted 2 years but a hard crate lasts for years and years and is the same cost. You can hose it off, its nice and shady. It has 2 doors, one big and one small. I would like to get another but it just doesn't go the distance."
5,GOOD CRATE,"These are very strong dog crates. I use this crate for my energetic two year old border collie, another border collie and a keeshond. The design is good. At first they are a little hard to set up. On each side of the top the bars have to be slid over a red button. At first this is a little stiff. Everything on the crate is attached so there is no way to lose pieces. There is enough room in the folded crate to tuck a dog bed. They do not take up a whole lot of space in the car. This size weighs ll pounds.I just purchased 2 more of these crates so that I could have one for all of my dogs."
2,"Nice idea, but quality issues","I really love the idea of this product - a light-weight, easy to manage, portable and sturdy crate. I purchased one several month back and after about two weeks, the primary door zipper broke which made the crate unusable. Amazon graciously accepted a return and replaced the crate with a new one. The second crate lasted about 4 weeks... same problem... the problem seems to be with the zipper turning corners - the prongs seem to easily misalign and then break when the zipper passed over them.I would love to get another one, but I think that I'm going to have to get something else that is a little more reliable."
4,Good Product,"OK This is about as good as this type of product gets at this time. I was taken back by the very strong plastic odor and set it out in the sun and wind for about 4 days which lessened the odor but did not eliminate it. I didn't want my dog to inhale such a strong and possible harmful smell. I also think that ALL collapsible pet kennels are over priced. You can almost buy a tent for what is being charged for these items. A ""PUP tent""? :-) I hope that competition will level the price a little. I am pleased with the quality and construction and hope it will be sturdy enough to last a few years. I would recommend this product to a friend."
4,It's very nice,"I have two of the Noz-to-Noz because my dogs get the soft crate very muddy after swimming and the Midwest Canine Camper was too difficult to wash out. THe noz-to-noz is fast and easy to clean after muddy dogs have been in it. I just hose off the inside and stand it up to drip dry. The only thing I HATE about this crate is that the zippers are VERY flimzy, of poor quality. I have long hair dogs and the zippers are always getting stuck by the fur (this NEVER happened with my midwest crate even after years of heavy use). The good thing about Noz-to-Noz is that if the zippers ever really give out you can buy a new cover for the crate, but I wish the zippers were better quality in the first place."
5,Awesome crate,This crate is GREAT. SO easy to set up and take down. I love it! I have 2 Golden Retrievers and got the largest size. It is very roomy for one and I can even put both of them in it if I need to.
3,"Good But Not ""Grate""","This is the third one of these dog crates that I have purchased. On the plus side, it is very light to carry and easy to set up/fold up. On the negative side, it won't hold up for long with a dog like mine who figures out how to rip the mesh in order to escape. For calm dog owners, it is a good value for the money."
1,FIRSTRACK NOZTONOZ SOFT CRATE,IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR PET DO NOT BUY. IT IS MADE IN CHINA AND IT HAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG PETROLEUM SMELL THAT DOES NOT GO AWAY.DO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT CHEMICALS THE CHINESE ARE PUTTING IN THIS PRODUCT.LOOK AT ALL THE CHINESE RECALL ITEMS. THERE ARE MANY REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CRATE AND MANY REFER TO THE STRONG PETROLEUM SMELL. LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO SOME DOG FOODS. THEY LACED IT WITH PLASTIC SO AS TO RAISE THE PROTEIN. IT IS DOCUMENTED.
1,NOT FOR TRAINING A NEW PUPPY!,"Do not buy this crate to train a dog! They don't work at all. Being a new dog owner I know very little about it and they say nothing about this crate being for trained dogs only. My pup ripped a hole in the front ""door"" in the first few days. I turned it around and put the hole against the wall, and now in week two yet another hole now rendering it's useless. I was only gone for an few hours, and I took him out just before i left, yet it took him no time at all.I will also echo what others say about the smell... it doesn't smell good at all, and the smell hasn't dissipated in the two weeks i've had it. I do wonder if it's good for a dog to be surrounded by that smell for hours at a time.There is no returning it because it was damaged by my dog. That's $90 in the trash. That's a real bummer.To sum it up i wouldn't buy this crate again even if my dog liked going in it. It smells really bad. And if you are trying to house train a pup don't waste your money."
2,sofkrate,"Sofkrate Dog bed: Appealing to the eye, roomy,but not recommended for the dachshund. If they are as determined as mine are (3), they will claw right along the zipper until it is long enough to escape. Ruining the krate. Bad Dogs!!!!"
2,difficult to pop in place and dog escapes easily,"We paid more for this crate b/c we felt like the value was there and wanted our dog to have a safe, comfortable crate to stay in..For one, it is very difficult to pop the crate into shape...I have pinched my fingers doing it. Secondly, our dog can easily get out of the crate, which defeats the purpose of spending 80.00 on this crate...Don't buy this crate..we regret it and wish we would have purchased a hard plastic or metal crate..."
1,Not for a chewer,"I purchased this crate and initially thought it was great. It seems very well built and it set up in just a moment. However, my dog chewed through it and escaped the FIRST time I left him in it. The only time my dog ever chews is when I leave him so I guess I should have known. So buyer beware, if your dog chews, opt for a metal crate."
3,Too Pricey!! Get the Dog Digs Crate by ABO Gear Instead,"I see good reviews for this item but I prefer the Dog Digs Pet Crate by ABO Gear that is more reasonably priced, easy to set up and is made with quality materials and construction, built to last and comes with carrying case that it slides into. Simple to set up and take down."
4,Seldom-seen scary treat.,If you can figure out the command buttons you will have your choice of languages and subtitles for this fun and scary Russian movie about an inexperienced young priest who is ordered to a country estate to perform exorcism on the corpse of a witch. She proceeds to call down her supernatural wrath on him. If you like the old Roger Corman pictures inspired by Poe you will probably love this.
4,Gogol's Viy,"Enigmatic, with a depth of 'Russian' which is to be savoured. Made in 1967, this film is a delight of Russian culture, not easy to follow, sometimes wandering, but always rich. Well recommended."
3,For Gogol Fantatics Only,"If you're a Gogol fanatic like myself, this is a must buy. Other than Viy, you get an extremely funny Soviet-era documentary about ""Comrade Gogol,"" plus an exert from Portrait, a silent-era movie based on another (and better) Gogol story. I would've actually rather have gotten the entire Portrait than Viy.Viy was a so-so story by Gogol and the film is also so-so -- not scary in the least. The acting and the writing (and the translations) are also so-so."
1,Tunes of Two Cities Redux,"The latest Resident(s) release reminds me of how disappointing The Tunes of Two Cities was after waiting in anticipation for the second of the Mole Trilogy. After the relative greatness of Mark of the Mole, Tunes was staggeringly poor and a major letdown.Now we get Animal Lover, the eagerly anticipated follow up to Demons Dance Alone. The songs are boring, the styles and effects hackneyed, and the overall result is a dud. Since 1980, The Resident(s) seem capable of about one decent release a decade. And given the Residents(s) age, Demons may have been their last."
2,"lavish packaging, mediocre music...","Ahh, the wonderfully weird Residents. First of all, I couldn't be happier that this group continues to anonymously weave their tangled web of sonic strangeness... but let's be honest, most of their material from the past 10 years is awfully unmemorable... Take the lavishly packaged Animal Lover -- lots of odd, bleak synthesizers and strange voices... a pointless ""remix disc"" (I guess?) with more of the same... very disturbing (and not in a good way) computer generated artwork in the booklet... It's sadly starting to seem like God in Three Persons from 1988 will stand as the last Residents masterwork... I sincerely hope not, though... maybe they should lose the computers and samplers and try an acoustic album next for a change of pace... I'd love to re-Meet The Residents I once knew and loved so long ago..."
3,Calm guys !!,"I think that the truth is somewhere in the middle.I don't agree that the ""Animal Lover"" is a masterpiece and also I don't agree that ""Tunes Of Two Cities"" was a bad record.It's two completely different albums with completely different musical structure and sound.It's wrong to compare these albums.Personally I consider ""Tunes Of Two Cities"" as masterpiece.In whom that didn't like this record probably he didn't understand of Resident's music.The ""Animal Lover"" is a good album that you can hear it pleasently but nothing more beyond that.It has nothing to do with the ""old"" Residents that we grow up and fell in love with their sound.The sound in all Resident's album (before 90') was full of the famous ""Theory Of Obscurity"".But unfortunatelly this theory starts to fade after 90's.Where this theory gone ?""Animal Lover"" it's not a bad record but I strongly prefer their fisrt albums that they has nothing to do with their latest works."
4,great dialog,"This book really shines in the dialog. The friendless (except 1 jock who apparently ignores him in public) Fanboy meets Goth Girl who alternately fights with him and draws him out of his shell. The back and forth between the two is delightful. Even more delightful is the slow realization that Fanboy has been making assumptions about people that may not be true including his best friend Cal, his step fascist...er...father, his own mother and Goth Girl.Fanboy's emotional development is satisfying and fun. A great read and an easy sell to even book hating teens."
5,Will his newfound friendship with the new Goth Girl change his life?,"Barry Lyga's THE ASTONISHING ADVENTURES OF FANBOY AND GOTH GIRL tells of Fanboy, whose sophomore year is being made miserable by bullies, the pending arrival of a new baby in the family, and the increasing distance between him and his former best friend. Will the graphic novel that Fanboy is so devoted to creating lead him to fame? Or will his newfound friendship with the new Goth Girl change his life?"
4,Dark Teenage Humor,"This novel is more of a character development novel than anything else (here isn't really any action or adventure); it's just a short time in the life of a nerdy, comic book fan, angsty teenage male. That said, the main character is very engaging, tormented, intelligent, likable, nave, and ambitious. There's a bit of foul language in this for a young adult novel, but nothing too extreme. Both Fanboy and Goth Girl have acerbic senses of humor that make the story amusing. If you like dark teenage humor, it's a good read."
5,MAGNUM AT THEIR BEST,"WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE BY MAGNUM.HEAVY BASS AND DRUM LINES,FANTASTIC GUITAR WORK, COUPLED WITH BRILLIANT VOCALS AND SOUL SEARCHING LYRICS. AS FAR AS MELODIC ROCK WITH A PUNCH GOES, IT DONT GET BETTER THAN THIS."
4,love this shoe,"This is a great shoe and just adorable. Got the black, it looks great for work and even to dress up jeans. Gave it 4 stars because of the bottom sole. If you want to wear these for a long time, you really start to feel the ground, as there is not much cushion. I imagine that this is just personal preference and could probably be solved by adding a shoe insert. In case you were wondering, I would definitely buy another pair!"
1,Pellica VersaBrite Pelican Flashlight,"I purchased this light and a clip on Strean light that were about the same price. Upon assembling the Pelican light, it gave a brief flash of light and then broke. It's not worth sending back, so it's in the trash now. Pelican should be ashamed to put their name on this light, the Stream light is the way to go, and it has 3 led bulbs in it for a brighter viewing area."
3,Good Brit Beach Read,"Fun, silly little romp about an awful British advertising yuppie and his awful friends. Things go comically awry when he starts to turn into a living cartoon (e.g. his flesh stretches to ridiculous limits, his thoughts appear as balloons coming out of his ear). It's not much, but Snow does take the premise to the logical places, tabloids come running, show-biz opportunities come knocking, and the government gets very interested... In the end, it take some special people to show the hero the error of his shallow ways and he must look within to win back the girl he doesn't deserve. It's all very heart-warming stuff, but written in a snappy, stylish British style that I find appealing."
4,Needs Break-in,"As received the staples wouldn't feed properly. Talked to DeWalt and ""They just don't have any problems with this model. Get it replaced."" Gotit replaced but meanwhile the original worked better every time it was used.The rplacemement arrived- a quick check showed the staple feed area to be extremely tight also. I sent the replacement back & kept the original.I expect the tool will become superior with a little more break-in time - or I may just take a little sandpaper to the bar over which the staples slide. I'm using Bostich 1/2 X 2 staples. These are galvanized - another brand or non-galvanized staples might feed OK."
2,Jerry's review,"First, I like DeWalt equipment, especially my workshop-table saw. But this new nailer I don't like. I only like sequential triggering - here's the problem: The gun will not fire every time you pull the trigger unless you follow a strict sequence- i.e. after firing if you release the trigger before lifting gun off the material it will not fire the next time you pull the trigger. This idiosyncrasy is very frustrating. Thinking this just can't be right, I took gun to DeWalt service center in Little Rock. They said that's the way it is. You must hold trigger down until gun is lifted off the work piece or else the head will not re-extend for next shot. DeWalt help us out here. Other nailers don't have this problem. If you like the bump trigger you won't see this problem."
1,Dissatisfaction of Staple Gun,The staple gun I bought to build a house about a month ago will not accept the staples; I have to push on the plunger in order for the staple to go up to the head--I am very dissatisfied with item and I do not have time to replace before the house is finished. Will never purchase any other any Dewalt Product. I have also been using a used Bostitch and it has not misfed any staples at all. Harry Presnell-Tennessee
4,Nice coffee table book,I bought this for my husband (he requested it specifically) as a gift. He is very happy with it. Note that we enjoy it more as a coffee table book than as deep research material!
1,an informative read,"Dr. Jensen clearly presents his vision and deepest understanding of iridology in easy-to- understand language. For those seeking to understand iridology and the mind behind the Jensen form of practice, this book is greatly informative. For those seeking true information on proper health care and iridology need not apply. This book is full of superstition, double-speak and gross misinformation. Certainly a fascinating read."
5,Loveable and Fun Characters,"The Blue Kangaroo series of books are a huge favorite with my two year old. The stories are emotionally relatable for her age. Toddlers can also sympathize with Lily and her favorite stuffed friend, Blue Kangaroo. The pictures give parents additional details to expand on the story. I highly recommend all of the Blue Kangaroo books, starting with this one."
5,hopalong still goes along with fun and action,"Hopalong Cassidy, Vol. 3hopy at his best along with all his side kicks,fun to watch .if you like old time western action this is the western to see!"
4,Good Value,"This saw, the first of its type I had owned, was bigger and bulkier than I had imagined. I guess the size is needed to guard against kickback. Blade installation and removal are quite simple, with four allowed blade orientations.I used it to cut 4x4's for fence posts, and felt that was about the limit of the saw. It did not cut thru them like butter, but got the job done.The saw is attractive and appears to be well made, and the price is unbeatable. For the casual homeowner user, I think it will serve just fine."
4,Good product,This is a quanlity product. No problem so far after using it for almost a year.The price is fair not too expensive.
4,Good reciprocating saw!,"I bought this saw after my first DeWalt was stolen. I had purchased the cordless model originally because I was doing demo in a house with no electricity, but now that I am electrified, I figured I would go with the corded model so I wouldn't have to be concerned about running out of juice. I haven't used it much yet, but the time or two I have I was pleased. Good price, good power. Love the options for blade position. Ideally, I'd like it to be a bit lighter, as I tire pretty quickly from the weight and vibration, but overall I am quite pleased. Amazon had indicated that a blade would be included, but alas, no blade. So I chatting with Amazon, then the good folks at DeWalt, who explained that they are no longer including blades in that kit. DeWalt sent me some free ones anyway for my trouble. Nothing beats good customer service."
4,Husband Loved IT,"My kids and I got this for my husband for fathers day, and he loves it. The only downside to it is it did not come with any blades - which the description did not mention. 9That was a little disappointing - if I would have known it did not come with one i would have purchased it also."
5,Does the Job,"I've owned this saw a couple years now. It's done everything I asked it to do, it's had enough power to handle anything I've thrown at it, blade changing is a snap, it's a great tool, and very durable.People keep comparing this to a Milwaukee, IMO generally speaking Dewalt tools are not as well made as Milwaukee, but you didn't pay a Milwaukee price for this saw either, y'all get what you pay for. Yes, I have a Milwaukee sawzall which I believe is better, but this Dewalt does something the Milwaukee doesn't, the 4 blade positioning comes in extremely handy especially when needing to make flush floor cuts.I like this saw, glad I bought it, and recommend it to anyone."
5,Very versatile and handy,"Very handy tool . . . use for cutting tree branches, landscape timbers, or for metal instead of a hacksaw (bolts, rebar, heavy sheet metal, etc). The worst problem I have with mine is that I store it in its nice steel case, and keep forgetting that I own it until I have been fiddling with some hand tool for too long. Should hang this on a hook in the garage for quick accessibility. Fairly lightweight and very rugged. Nice variable speed response. Note: I also recommend keeping a blade assortment ready at hand (you can buy blade assortments on Amazon at a decent price). No complaints at all."
2,"Broke after 2 years, Dewalt said warranty did not apply","This tool worked fine for two years, then it broke. I sent it to Dewalt for repair, and they said that the three-year warranty only applies to defects in manufacturing/workmanship, and since this had broken due to normal use the warranty did not apply. So I'm left with a dead tool, for the trash can.Bottom line: don't expect this to last three years - Dewalt don't expect it to."
4,I love this saw.,"I received this saw for Christmas and let me tell you it fita all my needs around the house. So far no cutting job I have had is too big for this saw. A couple of weeks ago I had to make room in my garage for a workshop expansion. I had decided to get rid of my old Universal weight gym (one of those giant multi-stationed pieces of steel. I was curious if this saw would cut through it. Let me tell you, after about 30 mins I had that monstrousity laying in a pile of 12"" pieces. This saw had no issues making the cuts.The saw was comfortable to hold, although my hands did tingle from the vibrations. I think that is more due to the fact that I was cutting free standing pieces rather anything that was weel secured. Great saw, great price. Love it."
4,Great saw for the price,This saw is completely adequate for most applications but if you can afford an actual Sawzall it's the better way to go.
3,Great Saw bad case,"Bought the saw for my son for his birthday. He had one before and used it often. He got to use the saw a day after opening it to cut the crate off the lawn tractor he bought. He was very pleased with the saw but when he went to put it away he realized the ""Diaper Bag"" they sent him instead of a hard molded case didn't even have a place to store the blades. Once you remove the cardboard from the soft Diaper Bag type storage case you have no protection for your saw. He searched ebay trying to find an old saw with the hard molded case but it seems no one is giving up the old cases. He had to buy a hard molded tool box from Sears for his new saw to protect it and have storage for blades. Dewalt could have a new business selling Diaper Bags because the ""contractors bag"" they are now getting made in China is not a TOOL bag."
1,Cheaply made for regular use,"I bought two of these saws two years ago for a large remodeling job. both saws developed problems with the keyless blade lock. One was unable to hold any blades after only one week of use. I'm still using the other one, on occasion, but always have to fiddle with the blade lock to get a blade to stay put. Overall, these saws are cheaply made and not up to DeWalt's usual high standards."
2,"Not durable, dont go for it","Looks good and works good, but the keyless blade holder is a poor design. The blade in mines is very wobble and I had to send it to a factory center.Got it back and after several uses wobbles again. Wont buy Dewalt recipro saw again."
3,Bad switch,"The trigger switch failed. Replacement switches cost about $40-$50 (50% of the price of a new one). DeWalt is just a tricked up version of the old Black & Decker. When their reputation hit bottom, they bought out DeWalt, a company that still built quality tools, just to continue selling their inferior products under a new name. Mine died on the jobsite this afternoon. I think I'll go with Milwaukee next time."
4,unsettling parallels to our time,"The writings that Schulman has gathered together in this book take on new piognancy in these years, as the US is bogged down in Iraq. Roaming through the various essays that deal with the Vietnam War, an American reader might be unable to avoid gleaming unsettling parallels from 40 years ago. The alternatives confronting Johnson, of escalating or de-escalating the war, were both unpleasant. Especially as a withdrawl was feared to lead to the fall of other dominoes in south east Asia. Just as some suggest that a withdrawl from Iraq would destabilise its neighbours; an argument put forth most recently in Bush's 2007 State of the Union address.To be sure, not all the documents are about Vietnam. Many pertain to American society, and to the so-called Great Society that Kennedy and Johnson sought to build. There are still pertinant discussions on civil rights, including the Watts riot."
4,"Not pretty, but fills a need","This vocabulary resource is separated by chapter, with the words appearing in the order they occur in the text. The selected words are fairly thorough and include many definitions that would be needed at an intermediate or upper-intermediate level. The book includes a short introduction, some more elaborate explanations for some terms, and a family tree diagram; however, not much in the way of extensive notes, external references, or historical context is included.This appears to be a type-written manuscript with handwritten characters. The characters are readable, but not pretty. Both simplified and traditional characters are included.Overall very useful, but would feel more at home in a photocopied three ring binder than it would in a publication from Cornell."
4,Great pop-ups,"The story does not have that much too it, but the pop-ups are really neat! My four year old loves it."
4,"Fun, easy reading","This book is ideal for the parents who have children that have shorter attention spans. It is fun, colorful and short. The easy to remember text is great for preschoolers who enjoy retellling the story to younger siblings, parents or other relatives."
3,Does the job,"These are ok for the price. Some are sewn a little wonky so they curved & they aren't all the same shape. And the sewing isn't stellar either, I had to do a little surgery on them with a needle & thread & some scissors. The non stick material on the bottom is pretty good though, they stay put fairly well, but we ended up tacking them down b/c they were for our dog & we were worried she'd slip. They were far cheaper than any other treads I saw out there though & budget was my main concern, so I'm ok with them. A pickier shopper might send them back."
4,bird book,"purchased for a trip to west Africa and was used on hikes, was a little outdated since I bought a used older book but worked well"
5,angels in the dust,This is a wonderfully written book. The story is touching. The language is expressive and descriptive. The illustrations are vivid and add much to the story. This was a great book to read aloud. It can give students a taste of life in a different time and place. Wonderful!
5,Wonderful Wit!,"I recently received a copy of this book and am enjoying every bit of it! The author portrays life in a funny, yet serious manner that we all can relate to. I particularly enjoyed the photographs which accompany the writing. I would highly recommend this book to everyone, regardless of their age!"
5,A Wonderful Reminder of a Talented Writer...,"Imagine having thought that a cherished friend was lost to you forever, and then to have her return unexpectedly for a brief time, knowing this is to be her last visit ever. For anyone who loved Caroline Knapp's writing, and mourned her premature death just two years ago, this book filled with her essays is just such a lovely gift. As with much of her other work, including ""Drinking, A Love Story"", and ""Pack of Two"", she had an amazing talent for intricately expressing her thoughts in an unusually accessible manner. While most of her essays focus on ""women's issues"", her reflections and sentiments are undoubtedly universal. Thank you to her editor, Sandra Shea, for giving us another chance to pull up a chair and share some intimate moments with this extraordinary writer."
5,Wonderful Book!,"I love Caroline Knapp. I have read all of her books, including Drinking: A Love Story, despite not having any problems with alcohol.These essays are insightful, poignant, and they wonderfully express emotions that everyone can connect with. Caroline Knapp wrote with humor and seemed to invest her whole soul into all of her writing.I disagree with the reviewer who said that some of the lighter essays were out of place, each essay provided a broader look of the author and allowed me the connection of humor as well as other connecting on more serious levels.I especially liked Lucille vs Stumpy, Letter to Zoe and Speaking out for shyness.I believe that anyone who enjoys good writing, reflective thinking and has a sense of humor will enjoy these essays."
2,MERRY Recluse?,"Well, I've read all her books. There is something about Caroline that you can always associate with - maybe the common ""fears"" women are always prone to. But, MERRY Recluse - hardly. Caroline didn't seem to fit in the skin she was in - in so many ways. Been there. Closer to the end she SO DID - in her passion for dogs. I have ALWAYS been a fan of Caroline's, yet I find such sadness (and lack of confidence) in her. Just wish she could have lived doing cartwheels, hugging her dog and not questioning or interrogating herself so harshly. I think we all question why we just don't seem to FIT IN - as Caroline obviously did. Maybe the answer is that we don't have to. I sadly acknowlege her death."
2,dissatisfied with reproductions,Ordered unseen and then attended exhibit. I was dissatisfied with color prints before exhibit and really disappointed afterwards. A graphic artist friend refused to buy the book after seing the color reproductions
2,reproductions are not what i expected,"I just returned with a friend from the Sargent and Italy exhibit , and I had purchased this book before going and thought the repoductions lacked vibrancy and did little for me, and after seeing the exhibit my thoughts were confirmed and I was even more disappointed , and a friend of mine who is a retired graphic artist and attended the exhibit would not purchase the book based on the reproductions"
2,Difficult,"Hard to grasp. A following sentence will contradict the sentence above. Ravings not musings. If read by a believer it is great writing. If read by a stoic it's ragtime.""In order to love God you must hate yourself."" ???"
5,fascinating,"This is an excellent read, especially if you like highbrow ideas. Reminds me of Ken Wilber. The author presents original thinking on a grand scale and his crisp style makes a real page-turner out of what could have been a musty-dusty history lesson. I must note that my own background in history is not sufficient to dispute any of the author's findings so perhaps a historian will write a review. I don't know when I have enjoyed a book more."
4,Puller Set,It is a GREAT puller set. The only thing wrong with it is that the cabinet was all scratched and dented from shipping. Other than that it looks like a Good set.Satisfied with pullers NOT cabinet.
5,Enchanting,"A wonderful book of beautiful photographs with captions describing each piece and a short history of each. The chapter in the book on Maintaining The Collection is worth the price of the book alone. While I agree somewhat with the TheLinenLady that the book doesn't have the comprehensive discussions that a serious collector might be looking for, it's the perfect book for beginning collectors like me. I think it's a must for anyone who appreciates fine linen and lace."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for some insight into the reasons behind what appears to be an increasingly narcissistic attitude behind modern culture. Instead I found a frustrated pop star wannabe who rails at everyone and everything that prevented him from becoming a superstar. Calcutt is not a sociologist and this book prooves it. Rather, he comes across more like a pulp writer hacking away at a tell-all.While there may be a shred of value in this poorly written attempt at explaining modern culture's woes, readers would be better served to look into James Cote's work, Arrested Adulthood."
5,Impressed,I am absolutely impressed with the quality of this bracelet. It arrived within two days and looked far better than I thought it would. I would definitely buy from them again.
4,Good and fair performances.,"This is a good Brahms cycle and would please any Brahms collection.We can find here the typical Karajan style of conducting of that years.Precision, clarity and brilliance of sound, but a bit of lack in deepness.Karajan made earlier recordings of Symphonies 1 and 3 for DECCA with theWiener Philharmoniker that are really thrilling and much more preferable.Would have been desirable to complete a cycle with these forces for thatseal. Whatever, this is a good cycle, but there are for sure betteralternatives (Sanderling, Klemperer or Levine)"
3,Good Not Great,"There are two readily available two CD sets from DG recording Herbert Von Karajan conducting Brahms four symphonies. The recordings on this CD feature clean digital recording for the first three symphonies, but an earlier recording for the 4th. The performances in this set are clean and competent but nothing special. The slower movements border on boring. These would represent acceptable versions of Brahms' symphonies in a classical music collection, but the early recording sold as ""Brahms: The Complete Symphonies"" is far superior and is my choice for the best complete set of Brahms symphonies. The recordings are clear and well-engineered despite being ADD. The performances are far more lively.Do yourself a favor and check out the other version. Chances are you'll find a reference to it as one of the other recordings shown on this page. The preferred version is DG catalog # 289 453 097-2."
3,A good read,"Charlie Papazian is the godfather of home brewers. His tales of various microbrewery vists around the world show there are many people who are interested in making ""real"" beer.The recipes are good also. I have the ""Quito Abbey Ale-1534"" bottle conditioning as I write this."
2,"I want to like this book, I really do",I bought this recently and have tried several times to sit down and read it and just cannot get through more than a few pages of it here and there. The book rambles and is not at all enjoyable to read; I found it tiresome and boring. The recipes in the back are probably the only reason I'll keep the book. I know Charlie Papazian is revered in the homebrewing world so I really WANT to like this book. I'd have a look at the book in your local bookstore and judge for yourself before buying.
3,Crib bedding,"I did not like the filling of the duvet cover, and the fabric is not as beautiful as it looks on the picture. It should definitely cost less for the quality given."
3,Love and Freedom,"I found the CD very enjoyable listening, knew tony when he was starting out and think that this is a tremendous achievement for him.. Keep it Up. Let me know of any new releases as soon as possible."
3,more guitar please,"Tony Cuffe has a nice, light, clear tenor voice, but I bought this CD with the hopes that there would be more of his exceptional guitar than there was. Nevertheless, I listen to it all the time picking out the instrumental riffs. What a shame that he was lost so young!"
3,Ok...but,Kinda cute but had a big gouge in it when it came. Not worth the trouble of trying to exchange it since it can't be seen b/c it is up high enough on the wall. Had to add spacers to the back or else the shelves tip forward too much. (Used the sticky pads you put on the bottom of chairs!) Made in China :(-
3,An Interesting Read,This book is instructive by way of example. It has not a lot of text but many interesting photographs in categories. The categories reflect the photographic or artistic value of the chapter.
2,The Photographer's Eye,"Huh, what, excuse me, am I missing something, what is he talkingabout? Get a life. What do I know? Give me a break! Oi vey!JWW in Los Angeles."
4,Good book,"It has good information and upon studying the photo examples, much can be learned about cropping for effect and placement of objects in the image."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this book in anticipation of what the first reviewer said. But, frankly, I'm disappointed. In my view, this book is nothing but a collection of photographs among which some of them look rather interesting. If you are looking for a book as described by the first reviewer here, look elsewhere."
2,Almost no text,"This is a book of photographs, with almost no text included. All of the text is presented in a six page introduction. The photographs range from the 1860's through the 1940's. Although the photographs are well-done and interesting, after reading the other reviews, I expected more. It was represented as an ""indispensable introduction to the visual language of photography"". I found it neither ""indispensable"" nor an adequate introduction. In fact, the review of the book by Mark Hillringhouse is far more interesting and edifying than the text in the actual book.A much better reference for visual language and composition is Michael Freeman's book of the same title (link below).The Photographer's Eye: Composition and Design for Better Digital Photos"
3,Disappointing,"I was expecting a book of photographs with accompanying essays on their artistic merit. According to the write up and the first review. I received the book only to find its a collection of mainly classic photographs but mainly well-known photographers, with virtaually no notes, this was quite disappointing. I might also add there are better compilation type photography books on the market."
3,An Interesting But Ultimately Disappointing Book,"I think Szarkowski is one of the very best American writers on photography, maybe the best. I have most of the books he authored or edited but had never acquired this one. So when I ordered it I was looking forward to hours of pleasure and enlightenment studying it. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I was expecting more from him than we get here. A brief introductory essay, a few lines before each section of the book, that's it. Even though I've studied photography and the history of photography in college and after college, I could have used a little more guidance from Szarkowski about the photographs and their sequencing than he gives us in this book. Since it's by Szarkowski I've given it three stars, I just couldn't bring myself to give anything of his fewer. But if you order it don't expect much of Szarkowski's writing or much information about the photographs."
2,"Just pictures, little text","This book is a collection of photographs from the MOMA collection, nothing more. For those (like me) who were expecting insights, comments, knowledge, this is not the book. It's dissapointing."
3,Up up and away,"If your not a die hard Battletech fan, or if you just like to combat with the figures, you really don't want this book. It does have a few new ground vehicles and Jumpships. It also has rules for advanced terrain and weather. Ultra-Heavy Jungle, High winds, heavy rain are just some of the things you could throw at the players. However, if you don't go into detailed rules for that sort of thing it has little use for a combat battletech player. Where it does come in value is if you wish to take your Mechwarrior Roleplaying group on the road. Like out into the deep periphery, or to create your own planets for your unlucky party. Also if you had always wondered about the inner workings of a jumpship, and what space life is like aboard a jumpship for months, it is interesting reading. To those people who are big fans of Comstar, the saviors of the innersphere (yay right), this is an important book for your library."
3,A helpful book.,"Have you ever wanted to create your own world to put your unlucky bunch of mechwarriors. Well luckly this book has the instructions. I realize that most of these rules were reprinted in other, more recent books, but it is always nice to have.For the comstar fanatic it's a must. It explains more about the mystic techno cult, but more importantly, the process that the exporer coprs is going through to find the clan homeworlds.For the mechwarrior palyers, it puts the experiance of space travel in the battletech universe a little more into perspective. It also give the interior lay out of a dropship and a jumpship, and some contracts for jobs. Something I found usefull in various campains.Overall, a good book to own if your a mechwarrior player (role playing) or you want to own them all."
4,One of my favorites!,"Granted, John Peel's Diadem books may not be the most technically advanced books ever written, and they certainly aren't great works of literary genius. But they are incredibly addictive, and great fun to read. I own the first six, and I've read the entire series several times. The puzzles within the books, while simple, give them an interesting dimension, and if you have the older versions, the covers themselves even connect to form one long picture. The characters have much more depth than you'd expect for a series aimed at a younger audience, and the story is actually quite complex. And not only are they fun to read, but they only cost around five bucks each."
5,Diadem,I think these book are great books for kids in younger ages and i am hoping to get to read the 7th book which has been wrote but not published yet!!!!!
4,Fun series,Diadem is a delightful series by Peel. The characters are well defined and fully dementional people. It's a series I've enjoyed re-reading again and again. See the Diadem Fanzone webpage for more details on the book series (www. angelfire . com /theforce/diadem)
5,Awsome!!,"I love these books because they're actually about kids my age. They come from different planets, but when they come togather they rock whatever planet they're on!!!!"
3,dogged retreat,"The operations of a rifle platoon were represented well as can be expected from a script: The retreat to ""safety"" was realistically exhausting and perilous. The platoon sergeant - former Wehrmacht - was a veteran war-horse that maintained unit cohesion the best he could with what he had. I thought the bulk of the 317th were a Cambodian faction of Montagnards? But perhaps they were Laotians. I rented a well worn copy of this movie at a neighborhood video store in about 2004 or 2005 and it's no longer on the shelf."
5,Very useful.,"Haven't really had a chance to try it but looking it over, it will work very well and asit is the one made for the Compaq PDA it will be useful"
2,No new information,"All the information in this book you can find online, actually you can find a lot more information online then you can find in this book. Recommend doing your research online instead."
3,Basic information,"The book is ok. It contains a very short history of the breed, and then information like what the breed standards are (for ""showing), selection criteria for getting a kitten, and then some info about feeding, household safety, grooming and some references of mailing lists, organizations etc.The book contains some pretty decent basic information. What disappointed me was the lack of specific information about the breed. Things like behavior, stories, quirks, how they get along with other cats or dogs or children, artistic pictures and photos etc. Also I think the book is a bit pricey considering it's (short) length."
1,Twice unlucky?,"My mother in law has owned one of these for 30 years, so when our 15 old hand-held mixer finally died, it seemed the logical choice.How times have changed! The first one we bought lasted about two months, and the second one has just died now after a month. Admittedly we use it quite a lot - but just for family cooking!It is very attractive, so if you want a nice piece of kitchen equipment to sit on the bench, this is for you! If you actually want to cook - look elsewhere!"
1,Strange deposits and other malfunctions,"We bought this stand mixer in September 2006, and from the first time we used it we noticed a silvery-gray deposit on the batter when it was scraped from the bowl (both bowls). Thinking it was some coating on the new bowls, we washed and scrubbed them thoroughly--still same thing. We thought it may be some oil coming from the motor and escaping from where the beaters are mounted, but that doesnt seem to be the case. About the 4th time we used it the center beater jammed and cannot be removed--it is abiut 1/3"" from being locked in place and wont budge. While struggling to remove it, some grayish powder came falling out--maybe that's where the deposits are from. Anyway, I wish we hadnt bought this product and would advise you to find another option."
1,Really poor performance,"I picked up one of these to make a birthday cake for my niece. I was visiting from another state and my Kitchen Aide wouldn't fit it my suitcase(!), so I bought this model at a local store. What a hunk of junk! It could not mix a basic, from scratch, yellow cake batter. After wrestling with it for 3-4 times longer than it should have taken, I finally used my sister's ancient & tiny handmixer to get the lumps out of the batter. I returned it the next day and was happy to get my money back. This is nothing like the mixer my mother used for years and years while I was growing up. Stay Away!"
1,Sunbeam Heritage series 12 speed Stand Mixer Legacy Edition,"My mixer is a Sunbeam Heritage series, Legacy Edition, color black 450 watt and I was mixing frosting and one of the beaters stoped working. My Dad took it apart wich was pritty hard to do so, and found that the gears are stripped and made of cheap plastic. For whatever reason, Sunbeam must have decided to cut on costs and used a plastic gear to transfer power to the beater. I had my Sunbeam for two years and the plastic gear decided to break. End of mixer. You cannot find a replacement part anywhere. Iam kind of mad because the motor and the mixing bowl workes perfectly its almost new it has not even a scratch on it. I tought I was buying a good quality mixer wish was gonna last for a long time. Ohh well what a shame... money wasted. I guess my next mixer is gonna be a KitchenAid."
1,Motor burned out,"From the day we got this, it was excessively loud, and occasionally had that ""something is burning"" smell... at first I attributed the odor to the break-in of a new heavy duty motor, but from time to time it would come back.Well, 14 months later the motor burned out making an ordinary batch of cookies, and customer service merely suggested I take it to a center for repair.I am very disappointed with this product, I think it was defective from the start."
1,What a mess,I have never had a mixer that throws batter all over the room like this one. I should have returned it right away.Today the beaters started hitting against each other and the mixer heated up and began to smoke -- and the mixer has only been used about a dozen times in two years.I'm shopping for a different brand.
1,Spatterqueen,"This mixer should be called the Sunbeam Spatterqueen. The lovely turquoise Mixmaster I was given in 1965 lasted until 2007, when the motor at last gave up. I still have its wonderful heavy glass bowls, which I use for hand mixing. The stainless steel ones on the new mixer seem flimsy in comparison, and when I try to whip cream, it spatters all over me and my kitchen! After the first try, which left cream all over me, the stove, the counter and canisters, the cupboards, and the floor, I've covered my clothing and hair and ""tented"" the mixer with a big old floursack towel as well as possible, but it still leaves a lot of mopping up to do. The mixer is all right for solid things like cookie dough, though it's a nuisance to have to push a button to lift the arm and beaters, but it is a far cry from its ancestor and a miserable hooligan at mixing liquids."
2,disappointed,"I have been very, very disappointed with this mixer. I have had the sunbeam mixers previously and they were always great, but this one is so hard to use, and doesn't mix anything on the bottom of the bowl. It doesn't seem to mix anything unless the bowl is half full. I can't believe it cost so much money and doesn't do the minimum mixing. If I could, I would send it back and ask for my money back and go buy one at a store, not this kind. Thinking it would be a wonderful mixer, I threw away the box before ever using this mixer. What a mistake. Either this is a flawed mixer, or this brand is worthless. I usually use my $15.00 handmixer instead of this one, it is such a pain. I definitely do not recommend this mixer. I am truly sorry I bought it. A very UNHAPPY customer of this mixer."
1,Broke during first use!,"I bought the Sunbeam Heritage for use with my cake decorating class. I was making buttercream icing for class and I turned it on to start it mixing and it was working just fine for about 30 seconds. I stopped it to move the mixture around and when I turned it back on, the second motor stopped working. There are two motors in the machine. One powers the beaters and the other powers the bowl to turn. The bowl motor went out and I was not able to finish my icing with the mixer and had to pull out the hand mixer to finish off.I would guess that if you are using the mixer for easy things like cake batter and such, you would probably be ok. But if you plan to use it for anything else that might need a little more power, go with a better mixer."
3,Sunbeam 2346 Heritage Series 12-Speed Stand Mixer,"I have not used the Mixer since I purchased it on 10/13/07. However, I can share with you what I noticed on taking the Mixer out of its shipping carton. It is a 450 Watt Dual Motor Legacy Edition.It is a heavy machine! This should be taken in consideration if you can't lift heavy articles. I found the ""tilt release button"", located at the top of the neck of the Stand Mixer very difficult to press in, while raising and Lowering the Mixing Head. This was particularly hard for me, because the ""tilt release button"" was too small, and resistant for me to hold in while, at the same time raising and lowering the Mixing Head.This would my main criticism of this model.Due to the heavy weight of this Stand Mixer, and the difficulty with using the ""tilt release button"", I doubt that I will use this Mixer as frequently as I did my last Sunbeam Mixer.However, it is a good-looking Stand Mixer."
1,Not the Mixer I had!,"I received a Sunbeam Mixer when I got married in 1963. It supported me through many wedding cakes, Christmas cookies and making bread. I removed the head to use it in my big bread bowl. It was going strong when 18 years later, I sold it. Now I have the time to cook again, I wanted a mixer as good as my old one. Within several weeks, the motor that runs the bowl section had quit. If the bowl motor is not working, the mixer stays put and the bowl won't move. It is also much louder than the first one I had. This is not a good stand mixer. I sent it back."
1,Unhappy,"The first time I use my Heritage Edition stand mixer I was making a cake after 7 minutes beating the butter with sugar its started to smoke I thought this was normal since it was new, then after 7 more minutes it got very hot and the bowl stoped turning, I had to use my hand mixer to finish my cake after baking it, it was ruined how sad. Its been a year now that I have the Sunbeam stand mixer & its still getting very hot. The sad thing is that I make cakes for a living and after one batter the machine still gets hot and the bowl stops turning. I have to wait for it to cool down to start with another cake, I should off gotten a kitchen aid.."
1,Dead in 5 rounds!,"I bought this as a (requested) gift for girlfriend's birthday. It did well with cookies, it did well with bread dough, and well with various batters. But died in only 5 uses! White smoke of death escaped the motor housing tonight and I'm really sad to tell her what happened tomorrow when she wakes up.I purchased mine from WM and it was on sale for less than a hundred. Deal was great then, sour now.I would recommend against the Sunbeam cheapies (and all cheapies for that matter) and am looking to higher power / well reviewed models now. Amazon is the greatest!"
1,Buy a KA instead!,"Don't waste your money, this product is NOT worth it! Had I done my research beforehand, I would have bought the Kitchen Aid right off the bat. Instead, I bought the Sunbeam Heritage series Mixmaster from Walmart for $90.00. It looked classic, solid, and similar to its competitor: The Kitchenaid which sold for about $200. Needless to say, the first time I used it, the power fluctuated in and out, the beaters are not thorough and you have to use a rubber scraper to get everything mixed in, and it smelled like burning wire (perhaps a short in the wiring?) Anyway - I returned it from whence it came and invested the money into the Kitchen Aid Artisan. You can't go wrong with a 5 star rated appliance! PLUS, it came with free gadgets, slicer, shield, etc.. ALSO - no tax and free shipping!"
2,Go with KitchenAid!!,"My first mixer is a KitchenAid. I have used it for 3 years and it is a work horse. I bake constantly and I have never had any problems. When I first moved, I did not have my mixer with me so I bought the Sunbeam Heritage to get me by. What a disappointment! You have to fiddle with the release to get the head to lift and it only works about 1/2 the time. The mixers do NOT mix in the ingredients on the sides of the bowl. Be prepared for your ingredients to fly all over the room (I am still cleaning up cookie dough!) and after all that? I still ended up mixing my cookies by hand to get them mixed! I am so happy to have my KitchenAid and will never settle for less!"
2,Not worth the money,"I often have to mix by hand, things always end up dry and grainy. Might be partially my fault - maybe I should try adding the ingredients as it's mixing.It makes a REALLY huge mess. My mother and I both bought one, but I told her to return hers, it wasn't worth it."
2,OK for the price,"My Grandma baked EVERY day and always used a Sunbeam mixer. That is why I bought this one, but I am disappointed with it. It is very reasonably priced and the motor has been powerful enough for the baking that I do, but those are the only two good things I can really say about it. When mixing, ingredients fly out of the bowl all over the counter and me. When adding flour, no matter how slowly, a cloud of flour dust covers everything within about a 5-foot radius of the mixer. I have even tried mixing with a towel over the top of the mixer just to help eliminate some of the dust. Also, I have arthritis and have found the beater realase button extremely hard to push. I guess this mixer is a good buy for someone who will not use it very often because it is a good price, but a person who will be using it a lot may want to invest in something better."
1,Good while it worked,"Had an old Sunbeam mixer on which the turntable wore out. It lasted about 10 years, so I thought to go with Sunbeam again. The new one worked for almost a month before the gears stripped out on its turntable. Don't know if its covered under warranty or not, but that is not an acceptable life on the turntable. The only work it did was to make butter from 1 quart of cream 5 or 6 days a week."
1,Not so Great,"Had it a year, it worked ok. But now, a screw has worked loose from the top part, and it prevents the head from tilting back. Total dis-assembly is required to fix this.There is no excuse for a screw working loose! Bolt it, rivet it, pin it, or Loctite it! I'm handy, so I'll fix it, but anyone else would have to trash it.The motor is beginning to smell as well. Can't recomend this machine, it dosen't last."
4,"Not bad, but not the best","This Frodo isn't bad, but the reason he's not so good is he only looks like this for a little while. If you like people in armor or Frodo or ect. then it would be cool to have."
1,Save your money...,"I bought this thinking it would be a great safety item. The driver would immediately be notified when a skier is down and have a faster turnaround picking up downed skiers. I've tried everything to get it to work properly, fresh batteries, etc. It either doesn't sound the alarm when it should, or it sounds the alarm when it shouldn't. No alarm or false alarm - either one is bad."
5,"Great music, excellent playing and a bargain","There are some rather trite recordings of these orchestral fireworks out there, usually not bad, but not very exciting. This set is not one of them. I fell out of my chair to this Pines of Rome for example. And several more, less known works are here too. Rimsky-Korsakov would have been proud of his pupil had he heard this."
5,Timeless smiles,"Even if you have never worn cowboy boots, and live in NYC it will still bring smiles, deep thoughts and more."
2,"Easy Reading, and some ""Nuggets"" there.","I enjoyed this book, but lack the belief it is for golfers. I suspect the author adapted his spiritual outlook to golf, to gain further audience for his books. Golf is a hot (money) topic to publish on these days. I'd expect this author's measurement of success with this book would not be whether you enjoyed your golf game more... but whether you purchased his core book, ""The Road Less Traveled,"" of which this is only a branch... or ""Trailer,"" so to speak."
1,Very slow play.,"M. Scott takes forever to get to the point in this one. Jeez, M.Scott the group behind us wants to play through. Pick up the pace buddy or pick up the ball. This is NOT a golf book and I feel somewhat cheated by the author and publisher for foisting this on me."
4,Golf and the Spirit - Peck,"Peck creatively addresses the game of golf as though it were meant to for everyone - after all, isn't life for everyone? Peck's description of golf as a game of perfection, compares favorably to the call for each person to live in perfect harmony with others. Though we never attain this perfection, there is no shame in trying, and trying, and trying again. He gives us permission to try, and fail. And, that it's OK to experience these regular ups and downs."
2,Heavy...,"When began the book, showed it very interesting, but along the chapters was heavy, long and not finished read it."
4,Insightful,"While not ground breaking I enjoyed Golf and the Spirit by M. Scott Peck. The audio was both witty and insightful. The author takes us through a imaginary round of golf on the fictional course Exotica. Like many courses, Exotica has roughs, sand traps and water hazzards to sufficiently challenge golfers of all levels. Dr. Peck's audio however has less to do with the physical hazzards of golf. The book delves more into the spiritual and inner aspects of the game of golf. The book uses golf as a methphor for life. Golf like life has many challenges and success in both requires introspection."
1,A writer should at least understand his subject,"It is quite apparent that Dr. Peck chose a subject that he is clearly not qualified to write about. I'm not really sure who he is trying to target with this book. If you understand anything about golf you will be bored with his lengthy details of golf terms and basic forms of play. If you are a beginner you will get into trouble if believe that his interpretations of the rules of golf and golf etiquette to be correct. Dr. Peck is quick to point out that after spending over 30 years as an avid golfer he is a terrible player. Part of why he is so bad is that he never bothered to learn the game. Now he thinks he is qualified to write a book about it. There are more great books about golf than any one person could ever read, but this is one that never should have been published."
4,Golf?,"Lighten up critics. This is not a book about golf. Just a book about using the GAME of golf as part of your life journey. You may not learn how to play golf, but let Peck teach you something else."
4,Enjoyed very much,"I'm a long time fan of Dr. Peck's books and also a golfer. I was so pleased to see he had written this book and enjoyed it very much. Hate to see all the negative reviews, it's just an fun and inspiring book."
5,"This is a great book, a fun and insightful read","I am a new golfer but my husband has golfed for years. I enjoyed the life stories that the author shares and was able to relate many of his experiences to my own. My husband thought that some of the golf stories were hilarious. We both found ourselves chuckling and recounting the stories while out on the golf course. The book does contain some history of the golf game, terminology and basic good golf practices. But, as the cover indicates, this is not an improve your golf swing kind of book. Nor is it a theology book. The author simply shares his wisdom by exploring the parallels between life and the game of golf."
4,"Not for everyone, but still a great book.","I agree with the reviewer from San Diego. If you're looking for a treatise on how to play golf, you'll probably be disappointed, but you have little right to be since Peck makes no representation that his book is that. Likewise, if you're looking for profound psychological analyses on the basis of Peck's background and/or other works, you will similarly be disappointed. But, again, he makes no such representation.It is simply an analogy between situations in life and in golf, and the ways we may respond to them. And though I did not expect it, I think Peck does offer some good golf lessons, especially for the beginner, since most of what plagues their play is the way they psycholgically and emotionally respond to the game, rather than their techniques of backswing, grip, etc."
5,Happy bending,Product works like a charm. No muss no fuss. Very handy and versatile. We used it setting a wall and worked great.
5,Refreshing Taste of Beatles,"If the current music landscape is getting you down plunk down some plastic and get this CD.You will feel that you have discovered a Beatles Album from another universe. The hooks, lyrics and arrangements are all there and done with love.Don't pinch yourself too hard 'cause you ain't dreamin'."
4,Judge An Album By Its Cover,"The album caught my eye because of the tattoo cover (which I love!)-- and so I bought it even though I'm not really familiar with the band. Playing the album, I was really surprised at how tight they are, kind of a raggedy pop sound, each track a little different in instrumentation, rhythm, mood.... Definitely interested in digging into this band a bit further."
5,One of the best debut albums around,"This is one of the best rock albums in terms of being able to listen to every track. So many bands release an album with a few good songs and a lot of filler, but not here. The drums and bass provide a solid and powerful foundation for the excellent guitar work of Bill Leverty. He brings a fierce, pinch-harmonic filled style that has a raunchy and powerful sound. If you doubt that, listen to ""Rock on the Radio"" during the transition from the opening percussion part to the main song. The other thing that helps this album stand out is CJ Snare's unique voice. It has a higher pitched tone that just sounds great with these songs. The band delivers a lot of hard rocking songs, but also brings a strong and sincere ballad in ""Love of a Lifetime."" If you are a rock and roll fan you will not be disappointed! My personal favorites are ""All She Wrote,"" ""Don't Treat Me Bad,"" and ""Ought to be a Law."""
2,Overrated,"It seems that the customer review @ Amazon.com are always highly inflated. This is not a bad CD, but 5 stars??? Come on people. There really is only one song I want to listen to on this albumn, and you can guess what it is. Everything else has been done before and sounds boring. I can see giving it two stars, tops. 5 should be an elite category: Like Nevermind by Nirvana."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"I saw Firehouse open for Dokken and liked what I heard. I really only knew Love of a Lifetime beforehand, but there is so much more here to like. It's a very solid effort. There are a few clunkers included, but once you get past the first 60 seconds of the opening song, it's pretty much smooth sailing. If you like 80's type hair metal you'll enjoy this. Shake & Tumble, Oughta be a Law and Overnight Sensation are a few of my favorites on here. It's worth your time. BTW, if you can catch these guys in concert, they still sound very good!"
4,Enjoyable release before grunge took over,"I consider this album--and this band--somewhat of a copycat effort of others within the ""pop metal"" genre--bands like Bon Jovi and Europe come to mind. That being said, this is still a very enjoyable listen from the early '90s. ""Don't Treat Me Bad"" is a great melodic mid-tempo single, and ""Love Of A Lifetime"" was a big ballad hit. To me, the best track on the album is the single released after these two songs which didn't make it nearly as big--""All She Wrote"". Man, what a powerful, melodic, rocking song!Other tracks are also very enjoyable. ""Rock On The Radio"" is a bit generic but has a big sound. ""Shake And Tumble"" and ""Overnight Sensation"" flat-out rock. ""Home Is Where The Heart Is"" and ""Don't Walk Away"" are great slower tempo songs--the latter being a true power ballad. All in all, a very good melodic effort a year or so before rock music was eclipsed by the gloomy grunge."
3,A nice debut album,"Firehouse's first release is not groundbraking, but is a good one. Some very catchy songs help this band become some of the last stars of the hair band era. Still they rock and roll around after many better known bands have disappear. Is a good buy for the nostalgic factor alone."
4,"not bad, worth the money",While it's not a comprehensive textbook it did provide the necessary information needed to let me know what to expect on several licensing and certification exams.I almost passed this book up based on the only other review(negative). This book also contains tech tips on every page separate and independent of the exams. I feel that I got my money's worth on the tech tips alone.
4,Another great western starring Hopalong Cassidy vol 4,"Hoppy let's us move from the west to the tall timber country in ""Riders of the Timerline"". He and California Carlson help catch a band of crooks who want to cut down and destroy precious mountain ridges full of trees.Anyone who is not only a Hoppy fan, can also enjoy the early career of Robert Mitchum. He got his start in the early Hoppy movies and appears always as one of the bad guys in these western classics.If you like shoot outs, horseback chases through beautiful locations, heros who understand values and principles, funniest side kicks to have ever been filmed, and just plain good American West fun, then you must have this classic collection of Hopalong Cassidy movies. You can let your children watch them and be a kid with them in these clean wholesome movies."
5,"Hopalong Cassidy, Vol.4","If you are like me, and you like westerns, gunfights, horses, and cowboys, you will be sure to like any of Hopalong Cassidy's movies. From his horse Topper, down to halarious sidekicks, disappointment should be out of the question."
5,Poster,I purchased this poster for my niece who collects fairy figurines. I purchased the figurine which matches this poster~ Loved them both~!!
1,Almost expired,The product itself is fine but the cartridge I received was a month and a half away from expiration and the price should have been drastically reduced to reflect that.
3,disappointed,"The Plano Crossbow case was advertized to fit a Tenpoint crossbow with a scope attached. I have a Wicked Ridge Invader, by Ten Point, and it doesn't fit worth a darn. If I had it to do over again, I would go directly to Wicked Ridge and pay a little more to get a case that fits properly. Once again, you get what you pay for."
2,doesnt fit all crossbows with scope attched,description says it fits most crossbows with a scope attached. i have a barnett DOA and it does not fit with a scope attached. tried several of my friends crossbows and they too did not fit with a scope attached.
5,Great product,"The bow case was just what my husband needed and as always from Amazon, it was delivered swiftly. He quickly recommended it to the delvery person who also wanted one."
3,Nice Case but doesn't do the Job,My husband owns the Barnett Predator.....We bought this cause someone gave a review that it fit....There is no way that it will fit with the scope on and nevermind you can't put the quiver and arrows in it....Sent it back!!
1,complete snake oil,"Used this stuff as directed and still had 3 fish deaths. It did nothing to jump start my cycle,stay away from this product."
4,start your new tank,this is a easy way to start up an new tank rather than using fish to get the biological chemistry working
1,"Has killed four fish in the last five days, doing damage to others","I used this product in accordance with the directions on the back and dosed my tanks exactly as described in the instructions. In my 20 gallon tall planted tank, it caused my Boesemani Rainbow, my Madagascar Rainbow, my Black Emperor Tetra, and my Dojo Loach to develop bacterial infections that has killed them. It is causing wasting sickness in my Rummynose Tetras, and playing general havoc in my tank.I also used this, again to the instructions, in my fiddler crab tank which has caused massive buildup of bacterial fuzz on my cured driftwood that in some places got a centimeter thick. My hoard of snails can't even keep up with the growth.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Cycle your tanks the old fashion way - by filling the tank, putting maybe one or two small fish, letting it sit for two weeks, and then slowly add in the fish you want. This stuff will attack the eyes, fins, gills, and anus of your fish."
4,Good camera bag,"High quality bag, offers alot protection. And not draw attention in travel.I am 5'9, feel it is on the small side but acceptable.However, if you are over 6'0, it is too small."
4,good,"I like how this looks like a regular backpack. However, it took a short while to develop a technique to swing the backpack from behind and get the camera out without dropping the camera. I have to unzip the zipper with the buckle attached, then unbuckle with the backpack held carefully."
3,Senco Bankruptcy: Will there be any parts and service?,"I have been considering this Senco gun. This spring, Senco filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and sold off almost all of it's assets. My local tool repair facility told me they are having a very tough time getting parts now and was not confident about the future. Too bad , they made good tools. So just beware. If you purchase a Senco there's no assurance that parts will be available. Many of the more consumer-oriented and Chineese/Taiwanese import brands have very short-lived parts availability. They are meant to be used by homeowners until they break then thrown in landfills. It remains to be seen what happens to Senco long-term. If anyone has updated info, please respond to this."
4,Excellent,This is one of the best finish nailers out there. Performance seems to be flawless. I only gave it 4 stars because the tool case is ridiculously larger than the nailer itself. Any other comparable nailer that I own or have seen the case is 1/2 the size. When you carry 20+ power tools to a job site space is critical.
1,refuse to believe senco built this,"This finish nailer is certainly not up to Senco standards, nor what I have grown to expect and experience with Senco products. The nail advance feed self destructed, with the end result being the nails do not advance. The nailer was less than 9 months old. Think if I had to do all over again I would have stayed with Porter Cable."
3,Sometimes doesn't shoot,"I purchased this nailer from the BOB to install lots of 3/8"" plywood sheets in the garage. A friend had lent me his Pasco framing nailer for the 2x4's. The Pasco works well, no misfires, no jams. The contractor must have it set in production mode because it was easy to shoot two nails in trigger pull.The Senco was also a joy to use. No noticeable weight, well balanced, and considerably quieter than the Paslode (it is a smaller gun). Depth of nail was easily set and consistent.I had three complaints with the Senco: 1) Air connector nipple was not included, necessitating another trip to the BOB. 2) Nails do not shoot consistently. I can fire 20 times, then 4 misfires. Usually when I'm in the most inconvenient place. It has something to do with the safety switch or nail guard not completely activating when the gun is set. I will contact Senco and/or BOB today. If they can advise a fix, the gun stays. If not, back it goes. Too bad."
5,An intuitive modern interpretation and theoretical perspective of the writing prose,"Deftly edited by T.R. Johnson and Tom Pace, Refiguring Prose Style: Possibilities For Writing Pedagogy is an intuitive modern interpretation and theoretical perspective of the writing prose. As an individualistic and unique style of writing, debates and ordinances involving prose have determined an indefinite place for the writing style in essence of college level teachings, let alone recognition. A welcome contribution to the art and science of English composition and a valued addition to personal, professional, community, and academic library reference collections, Refiguring Prose Style is a defense and pursuit of rekindling the praise and societal acceptance the intimate, subversive, and vivid writing style prose."
3,For those who like their Chaykóvskiy on the light side...,"If I had had the chance to hear this before buying (even with 1-minute samples), I would NOT have done so!4th = 3.5 - 4 stars;5th = 3;6th = 2.Ashkenazy's somewhat cool, no-nonsense approach works better in Rakhmáñinov (I can recommend his recordings of that composer's symphonic music unreservedly) than in Chaykóvskiy. The 4th symphony works well that way; the other 2 come off however quite shallow (perhaps in part because of what I've come to know and value of other performances over the decades) and even at times mechanical. The 5th still has some fine moments, but the 6th truly is a loser... If Bernstein earlier came off at times as over-calculated earlier, it still beats Ashkenazy!"
1,Wish I could give it NO stars...,"I ordered the Christmas Cottage DVD and we watched it on Thanksgiving with the family. I am very disappointed and feel it should have been rated PG-13 as a lot of the content was embarrassing to watch with children. The nativity was mocked and made fun of, the young women with so much breast showing was deplorable and embarrassing to watch with the men in our family, in addition to the sexual innuendos, excessive cursing... I cannot believe that such a DVD was even made by Thomas Kinkade. My eyes have been opened as to what he is really like. I am not talking about him as a person, but for him to allow sexual innuendos, mockery of the real meaning of Christmas and excessive cursing was so unnecessary and ruined the nice movie. I am trying to get rid of it. I am going to warn every one of my Christian friends that this movie is not what it appears to be. True believers, beware!!"
2,Caution,"We are great fans of Thomas Kinkade's art, and his Christian testimony. In purchasing this movie we were hopeful of a warm, family movie. We liked the actors and found in the end it had some positive things...family and friends supporting and encouraging one another. However, we felt there were things that would keep us from showing it to children or recommending it to others. Some low and bulging necklines, a father encouraging immorality in his sons by magazines, comments, and lifestyle; an openly immoral young woman playing Mary in the Christmas program. It is true that there are all kinds of people in life, and that there is good in everyone. Our expeience is that it is actually the man that is relating properly to his Lord that has the strength of character to find the right course in life and impact others for good. This testimony, which we believe is true of Mr. Kinkade's life, is not made evident in this movie."
1,Disappointing,"Went to look for a FAMILY video to have the whole family watch. I figured THomas Kinkade and Lions Gate would be safe and good. The movie dragged, the humor about his father was crude and coarse. In the end the movie doesn't close well. The depth of the FAMILY part was shallow. There was swearing throughout the movie. Bought it, watched it and threw it away! Mr. Kinkade in his opinion compares this to ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Not a chance! Don't waste your money on it!"
2,Not a Christian Movie,"this movie is far from the sweet loving story that I thought it was. Although it may be autobiographical, the use of curse words and Thomas's fathers disgusting language ruined this film. There are ways to portray that someone's charachter without vial language. I was extremely disappointed that anything associated with Thomas Kinkade would of been so rough. As well the story jumped all over the place. You never knew where the story was going, from him to his mothers distress of losing her home. Where was the 'faith' part of this story that inspired anyone that ""Jesus is the reason for the season"" because goodwill by people doesnt equal a heart for God. There are lots of Godless people that do charitable works. Would not recommend this movie to any serious Christian."
2,Didn't like it,"I could not get into this movie - I wish I could have watched it through to the end at least, but I couldn't, it was that bad. I thought it would be a heartwarming story like his books, but it is a movie about the life of Thomas Kinkade, it was not interesting and most of the acting was pretty bad and I couldn't stand his father in the movie at all. I wouldn't waste $$ buying this one for sure and it wasn't even worth a rental."
5,A wonderful feel good movie about life.,I have loved Thomas Kinkade's art for a long time. To touch base with how he got started and what made his drive for a passion with art. The movie had the family feel straight from the heart. This really is a must see movie if you love family life and Christmas.
4,Tear jerker!,"This movie is beautiful, I was very moved. I'm not usually a cryer when it comes to movies, but I cried for what felt like the entire movie! It was so emotional and heart wrenching, I couldn't help myself. Friendship, community, love, laughter, and warmth take place in this wonderful Christmas story."
5,Inspiring,I was so glad to see who inspired Thomas Kinkade to paint the light. The message was so loud and clear that we make a difference if we let our light shine thru in these hard times. I would recommend this movie to be a seasonal watch year after year.
2,Not good,"Not a good movie. But not because it has profanity or scantily clad women or suggestive scenes. I just found it tried too hard to be moving, to be poignant, to be funny, to teach us lessons. Overdone in some ways, underdone in others like plot and characterization. It always bothers me when a movie tries to convince us it's winter with all the leaves on the trees and flowers blooming. Some of the acting was wonderful, especially from the young 'Thomas Kinkade' whose dewy, earnest eyes and soft sincere voice lent such beauty to the scenes he was in. And honestly, it's just my opinion but I don't believe Jesus would have been offended by anything in this movie. He loved people with all their faults; he hung around with prostitutes and cowards(the apostles who abandoned him), rescued adulterers who were being stoned and died on the cross between two thieves."
2,THOMAS KINKADE'S CHRISTMAS COTTAGE,"I DID NOT CARE FOR THE LANGUAGE IN THIS MOVIE. I STOPPED WATCHING IT WHEN I DISCOVERED THE LANGUAGE WAS LIKE IT WAS. , I WOULD NOT REFER THIS MOVIE TO ANOTHER PERSON."
2,Hilariously trite,"I actually purchased it to watch with friends for the cheese factor (and because Chris Elliott is in it), and we were not disappointed: this was the most awful movie I have ever seen. Every line was painfully overwritten and unnatural, the plot was trite and predictable, and I cannot fathom a person having a genuine emotional respose to it.The whole thing was so poorly done it nearly moved me to tears...from laughter!There's a part near the end where Jared Padalecki was giving a heartfelt speech to Peter O'Toole and O'Toole was staring at him like there were zombies behind him about to rip his head off. Why they thought that take was OK to commit to film, I'll never know.I gave it two stars rather than the one that it earned just because it made me laugh. If you get humor and irony, get a cheap copy of this to show at your next party. If you love it for real...I'm sorry."
1,"Christmas Cottage DVD,Thomas Kinkade's","Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage. That I have not receive yet order in July 31,2009 and now it is August 31,2009.I am not happy with not having my order yet never been this long before,I will not again order from this person.sold by cdexchange-7Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage"
4,True story,"I hadn't realized this movie was based on Thomas Kinkade's life. It had it's sad parts, and is a little unusual for Christmas movie. But definitely worth a look."
2,Meh,"Definitely better than his other movie, The Christmas Lodge. Ugh. I just can't stand a bad movie. This had better acting though! It was the second time I saw this movie and I would maybe watch it again next year, but it's not a holiday staple movie. This movie is super cheesy. I thought it was fascinating learning about Thomas Kinkade's life, however much of this movie is true. I'm guessing not a whole lot of it. Just meh."
4,Christmas Cottage DVD,"I guess I was spoiled by the DVD, The Christmas Lodge, which I purchased from you a few months back, That I rated a 5+"
1,More disappointed with each viewing,"My wife loves Thomas Kinkade; and I guess I do too. Also, we're both very Christmasy people. CHRISTMAS COTTAGE seemed to be right up our alley. But this movie which should have been one of the best family Christmas films ever is laced with very adult themes and crude material. There is a fair amount of unnecessary profanity as well as sexual themes in this film.Yes, there is some heartwarming and sentimental feeling in COTTAGE, as well as an outstanding performance by Peter O'Toole. But how much garbage should a viewer have to wade through to get to the good stuff? It just isn't worth it. There are plenty of wonderful Christmas movies out there. CHRISTMAS COTTAGE does not earn a place among them."
1,Blogspot Z: The Christmas Cottage,"I bought this out of duty, as I love Jared Padalecki in Supernatural, and I watched it with a group of similiarly inclined friends. We were amused by the sheer Lifetime movie-esque feeling to this film, but it's definitely nowhere in the league of It's a Wonderful Life as a Christmas staple. It was more of a Mystery Science Theatre experience than a touching Christmas classic.[...]"
1,Save your money!,I hate it when people like Kinkade try to portray themselves as family friendly and then put out movies like this one which is full of unnecessary profanity. Profanity is the futile effort of a feeble mind to express itself forcibly. In the extras section you are subjected to the makers of this film congratulating themselves over and over. Typical Hollywood.
3,"Entertaining, but not deep","I was a little surprised I like this film. My threshold for sappy Christmas feel good dramas is low, but I confess I enjoyed seeing Jared Padelecki in something outside of Supernatural. While the story is a wee bit predictable, and some of the themes a bit trite: The glories of small town living vs. the life of the city, and wholesome smalltown girl vs. big city girl, I confess I enjoyed it .This *IS* a Christmas movie, so expect sappy sentimentality. I particularly felt the parents were quite stereotypical: Hardworking, devoted, (at times almost unrealistically so) martyr-like single mom vs. father who never grew up. But I thought it was a cute nonetheless. The message at the end was uplifting and simple.While the movie wasn't rocket science, it was good to watch once, and my family liked it."
3,Kinkade's Christmas Cottage,"The storyline was great, the actors wonderful but when you can't hear the actors it diminishes the DVD. I can only give it a 3 star. Very disappointed in the auditory control of this DVD."
5,My new favorite Christmas Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. It has a wonderful cast and story.I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection, and I think it would make a wonderful gift for anyone."
5,very nice movie,"This is a great movie, I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone at any age.."
4,Chrismas Cottage Video,This movie arrived in perfect condition. The movie was a little slow but a nice story of the life of Thomas Kinkade and clean for family viewing.
4,LOVE Marcia Gay Harden,Because I am SO turned off by Thomas Kinkade's relentless selling of HIMSELF - in everything from bath mats to place mats - I wasn't even going to bother with this film - until I saw Marcia Gay Harden was going to be in it. As usual she is absolutely wonderful. I'm giving four stars only because of her.
1,"Painter of Light, Director of Smut.","Thomas Kinkade owes my family an apology. Is this what passes as ac ""PG"" Family Friendly Christmas Classic movie in todays culture? We really are in trouble. My family, including my children voted to turn this smut off after 30 mins."
1,Not for those of high moral standing!!,"If you are a Christian or a person of high moral standing this is not the movie for you. I was mistaken to trust something put out by Thomas Kinkade would be clean. I should have read the reviews here first. I will not repeat what has already been said here, I just encourage you to read the reviews posted already. Especially the 1 star rating reviews."
2,Love Thomas Kinkaids story but this movie was very slow!,I love the Thomas Kincaid story! Jared Padalecki is one of my favorite actors whom I have met in real life. Hes just a all around great guy. So I was expecting something amazing with a good story and great cast! But it had me falling asleep because it was so slow!!! I was bummed because I had high hopes for it.
1,wrong item shipped,"I ordered a hard back book and was shipped a DVD instead. It took over 2 weeks for the problem to be corrected and my money refunded to me. I do believe in the future that I will only order items that are handled by Amazon, as this is the second time that I have had to deal with other suppliers and have had problems. It seems as though the suppliers are never at fault even though they ship the wrong item and that it is my responsibility and expense to return something that they shipped wrong in the first place. It is very frustrating to deal with these people and I will not do it again!!"
3,Likeable Christmas movie,"This was a likeable movie. I wasn't in the mood for the Christmas movies I've seen dozens of times already, and this fit the bill. I liked that it wasn't about kiddies, as so many Christmas movies seem to be. Jared gave a fine performance in this, although many of the other actors weren't as good as they could have been. What were supposed to be the humerous parts of this movie were overly corny and not funny, in my opinion. The dramatic scenes were much better and it should have tried to stay in that area. All-in-all, it was fine for a Christmas movie and I don't regret having watched it. Can't always say that, these days."
5,A must during christmas!,First of all the film had heart and Jared Pedeleki really brought a great performance but also Peter O'Toole as the aging mentor that inspired Kinkade to be one of the most loved artist of this century. I watched this because it was the only christmas movie on a couple of years ago when I really wanted one and it is a winner and one of my favorite of all times. Such heart and you feel like you are getting the rest of the story when it comes to Kinkade. It isnt sappy mainly because Jared's performance along with O'tooles is so authentic so you feel like you are watching it unfold in real life. Give it a chance - if you like biopics or holiday movies you will love this one
3,It's worth the time if only because it's based on a true story.,"Something seems to be missing; can't quite put my finger on it. But, overall it was worth the time to watch just for glimpse of who Thomas Kinkade is."
2,movie 'ok' dvd poor,"the story, was 'ok'. didn't notice all the 'curse' words complained about. i guess some people are just sensitive. my complaint is about the quality of the dvd. it sputtered through the entire movie, and as a result was annoying to get through. i didn't pay that much for it, so it's not worth trying to get a better copy. also the volume was very low on the dvd, as i saw mentioned in another review, and i had to turn the volume on my tv to 100% to just be able to hear it at not even quite a normal level of volume."
4,A story of Beginnings and Endings,"Famed painter Thomas Kinkaid had this film made about a very pivotal time of his life. Kept raw as real life tends to be, it is a sad and yet very uplifting film. Topics are deep and moving. This is not meant to be a young children's film, but more a teenage and adult film. Deals with motivations, the things that shape us, those who mold our lives.While I felt the character of Thomas was not given enough depth to fully utilize Mr. Padalecki's talents, his performance with what he was given was awesome. Several of the supporting characters did super amazing work. Despite the rough language given to Richard Burgi, it was the most amazing piece of acting I have seen from him yet -- the depths of feeling and information in his vulerable moments were totally worth it. Mr. O'Toole also gives a wondrous performnce.If you want something to touch your heart, see how life chapes people, and just get some of that Christmas feeling flowing -- this movie is for you."
1,NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE!!!,"I can't began to explain my disappointment with this movie! I should have read the rating more closely, but I just trusted anything with the name Christmas Cottage and about the life of Thomas Kincade would have been fine. Boy was I wrong!! I totally agree with one of the other reviewers about the blasphemous actions in the church. I know that they could have brought the meaning they were trying to portray in this scene without all the leg and bust show and the language. This is definitely not a family or Christian friendly film. I have not even mentioned the talent in this film from the directors to the actors.That is because there is not much to comment on!! Don't waste your money!!"
3,Poor Quality Carpet Treads,"The carpet treads I received from stacks and stacks were suppose to be all the same color and texture. However, the eight treads i received from them were two different shades of beige, one light and one dark. In addition to that, I received two different textures, four smooth and four twig type. To make make matters worse, when I called for assistance and to request a refund I was told that I couldnt be helped via phone and that I would need to send them a letter with my complaint and a copy of the package receipt."
1,Just Awful,"Stair Treads-Carpet Style - Set of 4 - Beige (Beige) (27.5""W x 8.5""L)I ordered these mats from Stacks and Stacks. I've been waiting for these for a few weeks. I finally signed on to Amazon.com to check on my order. My order was no where to be found. I sent an e-mail to Amazon to find out what happened. They said Stacks and Stacks was sold out of this item, but don't worry my card wasn't charged. Well, I've had a drop cloth covering my stairs for 3 weeks and no stair treads in sight. Why would a company be allowed to advertise a product they don't have? And they still have it listed.I think this is wrong!"
4,"Nice treads, exactly what I expected","I was very happy with the stair treads, they look exactly like the picture. No surprises."
4,as advertised,A typical plastic cutting board that does not slide around while cutting. The down side is that one can only use one side for cutting.
5,End Time Revelation,"After reading this book I have found it to be informative,precise and very interesting. Evangelist McClaurin has walked with God and has found grace in His eyes in order to recieve a revelation such as this. The Spiritual application to this book is on track with the current events of today. She tells the story with conviction,passion and truth. May God bless our nation and continue to send the message to the prophets and prophetess'."
2,Not Enough Volume,"I purchased this CD for the Holberg Suite. The music is not loud enough for me, and the beat is a little bit militaristic. I prefer a smoother version of that piece."
4,Good Sounds,My grandson was dancing in the kitchen while listening to these tunes.How great to have such an eclectic mix.I plan to put them as background music to old photos of myself and my siblings.
2,Disappointing,"My son grew up on Pete Seeger singing children songs and I wanted my granddaughter to enjoy the same songs. Unfortunately, this recording is of very poor quality. It was recorded at a concert, you can barely hear Seeger sing, and you can barely make out the words. In short, very poor and unfortunate purchase. I do intend to look for another recording, because I still want my granddaughter to enjoy Pete Seeger."
2,Freshness at stake,"I have a great respect for Pastor Cymbala. I believe that he is a great preacher, annointed and full of God's grace. I heard him several times and have been blessed by his sermons. However, I have read several of his books and frankly I am starting to be a little disappointed. ""Fresh Wind Fresh Fire"" was a great book on the power of prayer but since then, Cymbala's books seem to be a little redundant in their styles. The Brooklyn Tab's illustrations are similar and Cymbala's message is too. The ""Freshness"" of his first book and rightly so best-seller is fading. This book addresses a vague theodicy of 9-11 and the testimonies, while touching, have less impact today than soon after. While I did not enjoy this book too much, I still think that this book would be good for someone who never read Cymbala before."
2,I wish i had listened to the review,This item had to be exchanged for larger size. Once i got the larger size it slipped after 20 steps just like it says on the damn review. I am so disappointed now i got to pay to ship both back. What a waste but i guess that is what i get for paying a low price. The pro it looks nice.
5,Very pretty and great quality!,I love this hamper! The removable mesh bag is a great feature. You just pull it right out and take it to the washer. It's also very neutral so will go with many different nursery themes. I ended up buying this one because it costs only a few dollars more then the other folding hamper sold by BRU but is so much prettier. Glad I did!
5,Valentine's Day fun,This book was wonderful. It gave a great explanation of how the story of Valentine's Day came about. It also had crafts and other fun stuff you could do in the back of the book. This book can teach the history and meaning/purpose of Valentine's Day in an interesting way. The pictures are wonderful. The bright colors add so much to the story. I would recommend this book in a hearbeat!
3,not enough story,"Although in the description of this book, it says it is for 9 years and up, the official library review of it recommended it for K-3. I would disagree with that rating. I bought it with the intention of teaching why we celebrate Valentine's Day to my kindergarten class. However, the book is much more technical with lots of different information about Greek gods and old traditions. It is not really appropriate for five and six year olds...TMI. What I wanted was a story...something like the story of St. Patrick or the history of why we fill Christmas stockings with goodies...a good story the kids could take away from class, that would help them remember why the holiday is celebrated. I was very disappointed with the book."
3,Sea Monkeys are Cool! This Tank is a BUST.,"I love Sea Monkeys. They are fun to watch grow. I've had the classic tall red tank and it was great. This tank is too squat and it makes it really hard to ""air"" them without the special tool that has to be bought separately. Maybe that was the plan....Anyway-I recommend the taller/thiner tank so it is easy to pour the water to ""air"" them. Be sure to follow ALL of the directions."
1,mini world,you really cant see the sea monkeys in this type of aquarium and I had some algae looking type or fungus growing behind the 'cities' against the side on the first day. Waste of money. I threw it out.
2,Old product,"I bought this for my 4 year old to relive the fun of my childhood. We were all excited to see Sea Monkeys grow, but the product in the various packages was clumped and crunchy and had a hard time dissolving in the water. I'm not sure how long our City had sat on a shelf, but we had no luck growing any Sea Monkeys, which was a great disappointment to everyone. We'll try again with a batch from someone else (with hopefully some fresher eggs)."
5,A GREAT COLLECTION,This album is a great start for hardcore FOUR LADS fans and probably sufficient for most casual fans.The CD contains all the great COMMERCIAL successes of the 1950s which was of course the heyday for the LADS.
3,Memories,"Took me right back to 5ths grade. Fulsome orchestration unfortunately makes them sound like a Doc Severinson-backed-up band, but the harmonies are nice, even though they frequently sound a bit flat. A fun album."
4,Those tune-filled Fifties,"Although they never achieved the super-stardom of groups like The Four Aces or The Maguire Sisters, I always enjoyed the harmonies and voices of The Four Lads much more. Their music is so nice and never fails to lift my spirits."
4,history lesson!,We bought this to supplement our study of world history believe it or not!! Istanbul and Constantinople has become a familiar tune around our home!! The rest of the CD is not my choice for car tunes but we have had lots of fun listening to it and reminiscing about days gone by with our grandparents and great grandparents. My husband and I even discovered we knew many of the songs but didn't realize the 4 Lads were the original singers!
1,Four Ladds - 16 Most Requested Songs,"Excellent music, however I ordered it in error. It is a duplicate of a CD I already own. It was returned for credit."
3,A curiosity,"This later Schreker opera was never performed in the composer's lifetime -- and it shows. While probably of interest to the die-hard Schreker fan, it comes across as episodic, with the music and characters strangely unrealized. There are also a good deal more ""modern"" musical idioms in this opera than one hears in Schreker's other stage works.I count myself a Schreker afficionado, yet I find this work difficult to love (or even like). There are so many other good operatic works of his that are more fulfilling on musical, storyline and stagecraft levels. My recommendation is to stick with Schreker's other operatic fare ... my two personal favorites are Die Gezeichneten (""The Branded Ones"") and Irrelohe (""Crazy Fire"")."
5,woderful opera,Schreker dedicated this opera to Schönberg... You have great moments and som jazz and some dodecaphonic music also. Great!
5,FOX BUSTERS by Dick King-Smith,"I absolutely love this book. I have read the story five times, and I still get enjoyment from it. I bought this book for my grandchildren, but I am having a difficult time parting with it. I may have to buy another copy for myself. Mr. King-Smith has written other books, which I'm sure I will enjoy. tdg"
4,Love it--- most of the time,"I bought this machine about a year ago because of all the features and the terrific price. You definitely have to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS carefully, but it sews beautifully!! It's easy to use and very portable.I have two complaints: 1) I lost the large spool cap-- couldn't find it anywhere (the Brother website was no help at all) but I finally found a replacement at Sears for $2.16 but it cost me 6 bucks to have it shipped. 2) For some reason the automatic threader doesn't always work (time to re-read the instructions to be sure it's threaded properly).Great machine for a beginner or someone wanting to improve their sewing skills (that's me!)"
3,Minus Widescreen,"Like duh! What's with the ""Full Screen"" Deal? This movie was filmed in cinemascope or something like it. I have this movie in original widesceeen on VHS. Great movie, to bad about the ""Hack-Attack"" of the dreaded ""Pan & Scan"". Guess I won't purchase this version of the movie either(besides not buying the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"" for the same reason). Wake-up you film people, the age of HDTV is already here and the ratio has changed for TV. It's called HDTV and it uses the ""Golden Triangle"" Ratio which is a rectangle and not a square box as regular TV."
1,Do not buy this junk copy !!!!,I purchased this same copy of this movie and just like the other reveiwers who also own this I also want to tell you that this is a very poor bootleg copy. I don't even understand how they can sell this without getting busted. Amazon should drop this item until someday the real version of this movie is released. I'm telling you that this copy is unwatchable. I like the movie although it is a little cheezy and unrealistic.
1,Very crummy copy,"Do NOT buy this version--- I too bought this a while back hoping it was the real deal, but it's not! I agree, Amazon should cut this seller off- personally, I would like my money back!This is obviously a BAD VHS to DVD copy (it's not even well done) and besides the bad picture, it isn't in Widescreen & there is no pan & scan- it's just PLOP! into the middle of the picture & people's faces, reactions and important moments are lost!do not buy THIS version....I am happy to say I saw this morning in my email that a REAL version- Widescreen & all will be available Sept 2008!!!All that said- this movie itself is one of the best & earliest Viet Nam movies- an ensemble cast works together in a really well directed performance. Since this version sucks- see the other version for a real reel review :)DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!!!"
1,Don't buy this,"The Boys in Company C is a great movie, but don't buy this version. The person copied a bad VHS onto DVD and is selling it labeled ""New"". Amazon should cut this person off."
2,OK DVD Quality,"Great shipper, arrived quickly. You need a DVD region free player to watch it. That said, the DVD quality was ok, I was looking for a better copy than I already had, which it was not. If you do not own a copy and can watch other region DVD's, then buy it. If you already have a copy, you are probably wasting your money."
2,anti-american,I'm sad to see this piece of junk made into a d.v.d.I can assure this is not the way the war was fought when i was there.People just loading motor shells and firing them into no where.Sending 105 shells onto a mountain and then claiming a body count.Don't people know that there would have been recon helicopters flying all over the place watching what was going on.The whole movie makes me sick.The Two stars are for Lee Emery.The movie gets none.People should be watching We Were Soldiers that is how the war was fought when i was there.
2,"Lets face it, there are better Vietnam movies out there, mostly all of them","This is a low production anti war movie. The acting is sometimes annoying and the feel is of a cheap television movie. It has some merits, mostly criticism against war and higher command incompetence. The characters are mostly unbelievable and an amazing summary follows the movie to tell the fate of the companies men - In a fictional story? - Not much of an impact.This movie should be reserved for a completist - any thing good done here has been done a lot better elsewhere. A few have compared this movie to Full Metal Jacket and amazingly both have the same drill instructor Lee Ermey but other than that they both follow a group of men through training and their tour of duty in Nam. Major difference - Full Metal Jacket is a 5 star movie and this justifies 2 stars."
5,It's about time this came out for DVD.,A true classic to add to the collection. I loved it back then and I love it now.
5,Amongst my top ten,"I fully agree with the statement of Mark. W. Roen. Enough factual reviews of the movie have already been written very effectively. I would like to address the woman's point of view:Boys in Company C was my first military movie. It instantly became my favorite - some 20 years later, (and many many movies of all genres in between) I still consider it in my top ten favs. As a woman, I may be watching it with different eyes, as a retired military wife, I may look at it differently than other women. But I would say, Ladies, if you want to watch a ""guy flick"" that has it all, honesty and sincerity, human relations, laughter, tears, suspense, and most of all, the interest of your man, this is the movie to watch. I've seen it probably 20 times. Our video got worn our, and I am now waiting for it to come out in DVD."
2,just o.k.,"Was somewhat disappointed in the contents of the this book-lots of cursing!! I am/was devastated by my husband's death,and cursed GOD,but not using profanity. I was just mad!! Somehow it was revealed to me that my anger was misdirected..it was Satan I should have been mad at,NOT GOD. There were other books that I found more helpful,for instance the devotional-Healing After Loss,From One Widow to Another,and Heaven by Randy Alcorn to name a few..."
5,"It fits, works perfectly!","This product is the perfect fit for my Canon 430EX II Speedlite. I bought the Speedlite separately and after using it for about a week determined I really needed a diffuser. It doesn't really diffuse as much as it helps to spread the light. If you're shooting in a room with high or dark ceilings, this will help you achieve the shot you're looking for."
4,"Decent, not great (light that is)","Much better than bare flash, but nowhere near as good as my large, bulky, and ugly, Gary Fong. I fits in the bag better, so actually gets more use than the Fong, but still, if what great lighting from one flash is what you are after, use the Fong or equivalent. That is what I do."
3,Just Ok,"I have two of this item, one for my 430EX and the other for my 580EXII. The model for 430EX fits very well but the model for 580EXII fit too tight, very hard to insert and remove. Results are just ok. Not impressive but it is better than direct flash. Works very well on rooms small/medium, but not very well on very big ones, because flash light is not power enough even on the 580EXII."
5,works perfectly as advertised,I bought the slightly wrong model (Speedlite 420 versus 430 flash) but it slipped right onto my flash and has stayed put perfectly well. The first night I used this I was taking photos at a pirate-themed Halloween haunted house. Lighting came out exactly as I wanted to without having to have any cheesy pieces of cardboard rubber banded to the flash and without anything but matte black walls to bounce off. The lighting turned out even in conditions that were terrible for taking clear photos.
3,Not the results I expected.,"Alright.I had too much expectations about this product. The item itself is great as it feels strong and will for sure last for eternity.But honestly the results you get are not much different from what you can get without it or using some other creative method of diffusing or rebounding the flash.I find this product to produce harsh shadows and it doesn't work very good in open dark locations where flash light cannot be rebounded in some way.In my opinion, you should invest in some other kind of diffuser or rebounder. You could get better results even being creative with cards or a piece of white cardboard attached to the head of your flash."
3,Loses power quickly,"This makes for excellent shadow control on pictures up to 15 feet away, but it falls off quickly. Close ups are blown away too. But for general shooting, like a wedding, it works fine."
5,awesome,"beside softening shadows, also color corrects in tungsten lighting. wonderful when bouncing your flash/a great tool to have in your camera bag."
4,Very effective for light wrapping,I am shooting a good number of product shots that are giving me a heck of a time due to shiney/reflective surfaces. This omni bouncs softens the reflection effect in most situations. Easy to use just have to be careful how I carry it with me as it is fragile.
3,Disappointed,"First and foremost, it took a long time to arrive (although within the date range). Unfortunately it also arrived cracked. I use it on a Canon 430 EX, and it is difficult to slide on and off. It does significantly change the flash; not always for the better. Its cheap enough that it is ok to have invested in, but I will be looking to add on a more high end one in the near future."
5,Fits perfectly & works as advertised,It fits perfectly over the flash & does not obstruct anything. Images appear as product is intended to produce with even tones & less shadows.
3,Gets the job done,"I keep it in the bag as a just in case item. I'm more for studio lights, but out in the field with families sometimes a speedlite and a PW are all you've got, and this product makes it less glaring!"
4,Works well with Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash,"I purchased this with the Canon 430EX Speedlite Flash. It fit like a glove, and works as expected."
3,flash diffuser,"The diffuser works as described, but you need to open the lense by an f-stop or two to compensate for the loss."
5,Awesome!,It made a huge difference in my photos! Its a small part but makes a big difference.. I am happy with the investment!
4,"This is for the 430, not the 520!","Be careful! This one does not fit the 580! The product description is not clear on this and being a beginner, I didn't know and bought this one for a 580 flash. I would return it, but the shipping cost along makes it not worth it. I'm going to try to exchange it at a local store. Hope this helps prevent someone else from making the same mistake."
3,No hace maravillas,"Cumple con lo que promete que es extender la luz del flash por todos lados aunque pierde como 2 puntos de exposición.No me dejo muy contento porque me esperaba otro resultado, como el del softbox que tiene mejor suavizado y la luz es más concentrada. Hay que saber para que se va a necesitar antes de compar algún producto. Viendo en la web, el Lightsphere de Gary Fong es mucho mejor, por algo cuesta más."
2,essentially pointless,"I bought this because I thought the product made the flash less harsh for direct flashes(no bounce availible). It barely makes a difference, the highlights on skin is the same with or without it. It appears the 5 star review is from someone who probably gets paid when people buy it. Even for how cheap it is, it isn't worth it.It also falls off easily"
3,Poor customer service,"Item is good, fast delivery but poor customer service. I got the wrong size and asked for an exchange via two emails and never got a response from them."
2,Doesn't fit for Precision flash!,I have a precision flash which I use with my Canon rebel XT DSLR. I was little hesitant to buy this thinking whether it will fit to my flah or not. I did lot of research and could not find any reviews whether this can be used for precision flash. Unfortunately it does not fit and its very very tight. If product specs had dimensions under it then it would have been helpful..
4,Fits 430EX ii very well,Good entry level diffuser for my 430EX ii. I don't worry about it falling off at all. It was very tight getting it on the flash the first time but since then it has gone on easier. Feels a bit cheap in the hands but for the price you can't beat it.
3,too expensive,I think it is too expensive you can buy something like this from ebay much cheaper. It's a piece of plastic I don't think it needs to be special.
3,"Works well, but too expensive.","I have no complaints about the functionality of this diffuser. It does a very nice job of softening and controling light from my Canon flash. Unlike one of the reviewers above, I found that it fits the flash perfectly: it's easy to slip on, but maintains enough friction that it will not easily fall off without purposeful pulling. My only complaint is that this plain piece of flimsy plastic, without any complications that would make manufacture difficult, costs $9, and then requires another $7 of shipping. It's just overpriced. I suppose I shouldn't complain since it increases the functionality of a $400 flash, but it is, afterall, just a flimsy piece of plastic."
3,Works OK; Loses a LOT of Light,"Not much else to say. The diffuser works OK, but no better than an index card. It also costs a full stop on the flash exposure. Save your money; use a white index card instead."
5,Bounce Flash Cover,This bounce flash cover has worked perfectly for indoor shots when needed. It is easy to pop on and off.
5,This diffuser does exactly what it's meant to do.,The diffuser is made of high quality plastic. It distributes the light from a flash evenly. Makes lighting a picture much more distributed making the picture color and white balance great!
4,works great.,"I bought the item because i have it for the 580ex and it works like a charm. Not much can be said about it, it fits on, a little looser then the one on my 580(which is good because it is a pain to get on and off of the 580) It is a little on the expensive side, i mean it is just a piece of thick plastic, not much different then the bottom of a rubbing alcohol bottle.One thing of note, with it on, you can not close the flap on the padded case that comes with Canon speedlites."
3,Would be great if it would fit.,Well after doing a lot of research on a flash unit and reading all the reviews for the NISSIN Di622 flash for Canon EOS cameras I went ahead and purchased the flash and along came the suggestion of the STO-FEN OMNI- BOUNCE flash for the unit. Well I can tell you now that it has arrived don't take the work of the seller because this item does not come close to fitting the flash unirt as Amazon suggested. I have contacted the seller in hope that they will be kind enough to take it back. Over theyears I have used Amazon for many purchases and this one just eats my craw because one woould think that when a suggestion is made that they would make sure the item is going to work with the orginal item purchsed
2,Gives my pictures a tint....,"I have taken many pictures, one using this diffuser and the same picture without the diffuser. The pictures without the diffuser looked natural, the ones with the diffuser had a brownish tinge to it. Pictures of faces using this diffuser look too tanned and I have to correct the color in my photo processing program. I also find my pictures come out darker with it then without it so it does lose some flash from your 430EX. I find it a nice idea but it also has its problems. I prefer to not use it and bounce the flash whenever possible."
3,Not bad for the money.,"I am not that impressed with this item, but considering the price, I am sufficiently satisfied with it. I don't think it's necessary when using bounce flash. I only use it in situations where I can't use bounce, like with very high ceilings or outside. And in those cases when I'm aiming the flash at the subject, I don't get a dramatically improved result. Better than without it, but not dramatic."
4,Good DVD-R,I've burned several DVDs using this Verbatim model on a single speed DVD burner and have had NO problems with any of them. The DVDs played on every DVD player I've tried. The only thing I haven't tested is how well ink stays on these inkjet/thermal DVDs.
5,An enticing South African Mythology,"I wasn't even sure at what parts I was supposed to supend my disbelief. Brink weaves a South African Boer mythology that makes the Greek version seem mundane. Like all mythologies, it explained a culture. His story of a village of secluded and inbred hyper-calvinist helped me to understand the Boer. And I don't mean that in a bad way. They were obviously a rugged God-fearing jihad going people, tougher than nails, living shrapnel. He brings you into their world view through the stories they use to explain it. This book is mighty."
1,Sorry Andre.,"I never give up on a novel but in this case I am tempted as I fear I am wasting valuable reading time on, frankly, rubbish. What the hell is the guy trying to say? What are his political ideas? I am half way through the novel and I have no clue as to what he is trying to portray. Is Andre one of those attractive Afrikaan types that the world cannot forgive South Africa for having spawned. His totally uninteresting main character in this uninteresting novel is portrayed as a bitter, unattractive, nasty middle-aged man but he just comes across as a half-drawn, two-dimensional creature, who really only wants to indulge in masturbatory middle-aged fantasies. He does not even know how to swear convincingly! And if the Flemish hell hole he ends up into is as disturbing and grotesque as a Hyeronimous Bosch then I am Winnie Mandela. What a wank! Give me The Power of One or even Wilbur any day."
1,The Hawk Was Stillborn,I thought this movie looked like a great nature type feel good movie but it turned out to be a over dramatic dis-jointed bunch of disfunctional weirdos and the dialog sounded like they made it up as they went along and not much of it made any sense. I decided to watch it as comedy but still couldn't get through half of it - what a disappointment. I'm surprised that the entire cast didn't commit suicide. Blaaaaagh.
5,Ignore the lesser reviews--one of the most compelling films I have ever enjoyed,"This movie is truly extraordinary, and the principal actor, who also starred inBig Fat Liar (Full Screen Edition)combines brilliant acting with a very capably trained hawk to provide one of the most satisfying 90 minutes of ""tuning out"" that I have enjoyed in some time.Sure, this movie has every corney bit from the special child to the sexed up teen-ager to the idiot father that ran, but it kept my complete interest throughout. The hawk, and the man, came of age together, the man found love, and the hawk soared.This is a GREAT movie.Some others featuring animals as wildlife that I have enjoyed:Dances with Wolves (Widescreen Edition)The EdgeBlack BeautyThe Snow WalkerA Man Called Horse"
1,Can't rate it because I can't watch it,"Although other Prime Instant Videos work fine, this one does not. Just a blank black screen. Would be nice if it worked."
3,Charlie Brown Christmas,"I purchased this as a gift. I was a bit disappointed as the expressions on the face of Sally and Linus are not as depicted in the Amazon photo, and the person I gave it to noticed that as well. For the price paid it should have been EXACTLY as depicted in the photo. But will keep the item as we like Peanuts figures and it is too much of a hassle to figure out how to exchange or return from the 3rd party seller."
2,Was I reading the same book?,"Having read many of the glowing reviews for this book, I'm a little confused. Few of them sound like the book I read. The one I read did have nonstop action, and no doubt its basic premise is, shall we say, ""too true to be good."" Beyond that, however, the book I read was biblically shallow, had an over-the-top storyline, and contained numerous textual errors. After looking forward to reading it (gift from a friend), I was disappointed to find it so. Did a different book somehow implant itself in my copy of The Rapture Dialogues?"
2,Wonderful Book,"Could not put the book down once I started, just like the ""Left Behind"" books you just HAVE to keep reading to see where you are being led and find out what is going to happen next. The action, suspense, and even a little romance thrown in was great. Thought it was very interesting how the very first two words were also the last two words. Beginning to end the book has a lot of truth from the scripture references to the details of the individuals that are protrayed. Time to stop and think about what might be just around the corner for mankind. Thank you Terry for a great book. Defintely 5 stars"
3,Rapture Dialogues,"This book was just okay for me. Some of the details were very interesting and different from other similar books I have read, but overall I thought it left some loose ends. There was also too much airplane lingo for my liking, but that's just my personal preference. A better choice, in my opinion, would be Lynn Marzulli's ""Nephilim."""
2,"O.K., but really no suspense.","This book was o.k. It was NOT a thriller. No matter what situation or danger our heroes find themselves, they more or less just sit back and God do his thing. Really, the heroes of the book are more like 'on-lookers' as they really don't do anything heroic or adventuresome. No matter the danger they find themselves in, they do absolutely nothing and let the angels of God come and save the day. As a Christian, I have no problems with the issues of faith used in the book. But in the context of a ""thriller"" type novel, there is absolutely no suspense because the characters are never in any real danger. They keep reminding themselves throughout the book that ""God brought us this far, whater happens, He will protect us"". It doesn't make for much excitement."
5,Best book in a long time,"I could not putt the book down, very well done, can't wait for the next one. Even though this is fiction, I believe as well there is truth to the base message."
4,Provocative Challenging and Entertaining,"In The Rapture Dialogues, Terry James added a provocative and challenging twist to the subject of UFO phenomenon. This book is both fictionally entertaining and scripturally accurate. I will definitely be reading the sequel. (Jocelyn in Florida)."
5,Must Read Book!,"As a student of bible prophecy, I remember reading Hal Lindsey's ""The Late Great Planet Earth"", a book written during the 1960's and establishing the bible interpretation of linking UFO's to End Times.Terry's new book needed to be written and needs to be read. The ending was flat-out incredible! DO NOT READ THE ENDING FIRST!Thanks Terry for accepting God's calling to write this factual book with fictional characters.Jeff McGuire"
4,Excellent Novel!,"Terry James New Book The Rapture Dialogue I highly recommend to anyone studying the end times. I found it insightful, suspenseful and a very fast read. It will leave you with the feeling of wanting to share the information you have learned with everyone you know. If you own the Left Behind series or Earthquake Resurrection you will want to add The Rapture Dialogue to your collection.RW Schilz"
5,The Rapture Dialogues,"This book was so well written, it seemed as if it was true. I purchased 6 books because I knew when my friends would borrow it, I would not see it again because the storyline was so gripping. I highly recommend this book and look forward to a sequel."
3,Handy Small Screwdriver,"Good ratcheting action, but too small for my hand. Hard to get a good grip on the small handle. Maybe good for very small projects!"
3,Good at start,"When i first got this phone, i was really happy with it. i thought the features that came with it were great, and really worth the price. ofcourse, there comes a however: three days after i bought it, the camera has a major malfunction. everything i try to photograph (indoors/outdoors, day/night, white/black)comes out with a very annoying red tint. the pictures are all monotone. just red and white.i called ""customer service"" psshhh. they told me to reset the phone settings... didnt work. then they told me i should just send the phone in, and they'l diagnose the problem and repair the phone, if not replace it. i figured why not... but then they tell me it could take up to a MONTH from the day i send it out with my own bloody money. this would not be a problem if i werent leaving to college in a bloody week. now i have to have someone send it to me in college once it arrives at my NJ residence.if you want a good phone which comes with a good headache, get this phone."
1,Problematic Phone,"I have had this phone for over a year and a half, I've had to have it replaced twice already. The first time the outer display stopped working. All three of the phones do this thing where the phone crashes out of nowhere, which gets really annoying when I'm in the middle of writing a text message. Also, the camera button is on the outside, where it takes pictures by itself, usually in my pocket. Sometimes I can't hear the person on the other side, or they can't hear me. This phone has way too many issues. On the bright side, the operating system is easy to use. Also the timer is cool and so is the fact that you can set multiple alarms. The settings are preset so you cannot set them up on your own. The phone overall just has way too many problems though."
3,Works great in my area..... not much features,"The screen is tiny, like an ipod nano screen on its side. The camera viewfinder is barely visible because it is 4:3 ratio and it is like an inch from corner to corner. The ringtones are cheesy and my motorola E815 is so much better. the camera is only VGA (.3 megapixels) versus 1.3 on the E815.Its a good looking average phone though. I do warn you that it's not Black and grey its light blue and a little bit darker than navy blue.______________\\ //Peace out____,,,\\//____________\\\--_-\____________\___\\/"
4,A great medical history study,"Although it was read in conjunction with an urban history class, I found this book to be very engaging and moving. Rosenberg's writing flows easily through a very disturbing subject. He sets up very fluid parallels between the epidemic's appearance at all three major years: 1832, 1849, and 1866. Of special interest is the role of the NYC Metropolitan Board of Health in controlling and defeating the epidemic.. I hope I didn't ruin the ending for any interested readers: NYC is still a healthy city, despite outbreaks like the ones that Rosenberg identifies..."
5,That Mysterious Texas Brand Man,I received my book on time in excellent condition. I hope to get all Maggie Shayne's Brand books. She knows how to hold your attention.
5,Page turner,I read a lot of romance novels and this is one to treasure heart and soul. A perfect book and a perfect author
4,Star Wars A-wing fighter review,"I really like the color scheme & weathered paint job on this toy.My only critique, is that Hasbro didn't produce a new action figure.It's a previously release figure with a different paint job & I don't like how the helmet is painted."
5,The Belly Book,I purchased this book because in my country all books of such kind are just not attractive to me.I like the belly-shaped hard cover and the inside of the book divided into three trimester parts. The book has a lot of space for entering both written data and photos. I think it's a perfect gift for a Mum-to-be.Can't wait to start writing in it! :-)
4,Great book for me!,"After looking at many pregnancy journals online and in the store, I chose The Belly Book because of its cute design and unique set-up. It is broken down by trimesters and has sections for pictures, doctor's visit info, and of course journaling. What I liked about it over others was that it was concise and helped lead you into topics you might not think of, but still allowed for free writing. Yes, it does start at week one and we of course don't know that we are pregnant then, but you can go back and fill in what was going on in your life when you were possibly conceiving. Overall, I think this was the best journal out there!"
4,Very cute journal,I like this journal better than my first. It allows you more space to journal and doesn't just quip about the discomforts of pregnancy. I also really like the band that helps keep it closed.
5,Great keepsake for first time moms!,"I love the way this book is put together! There are tons of spots for pictures, and spots to fill out how you told people, how you felt exc.. There's even spots for both sides of the family. I also purchased 'My Baby Book: A Keepsake Journal for Baby's First Year' by the same author. I highly recommend both books/journals! The easiest 'scrap-booking' I've ever done!"
4,Great book,"I definitely would recommend this book, and will buy it again with my next pregnancies, as well as for friends. I only gave 4 stars because the spots for the belly pics are kind of small so I had to cut some of my photos very small and cover up portions of the writing section. I didnt add the photos till later so I couldn't retake them. Just make sure your photos will fit then take them from the same angle/spot each time. Also there is only room for 39 weeks, so if you are overdue you'll have to get creative with the pages, also only so many spots for dr appointments, I delivered at 38 weeks and had already used up all the slots, so plan accordingly (maybe double up one or two on the same page). All in all pleased with my purchase."
2,Disappointed,"This wasn't really for me. Many of the questions don't pertain to what is going on (like what movies I've been watching, etc) and I left most of it blank. I think it is a great idea...I wish I had gotten something that was a little more open-ended and creative."
2,Not really a journal,"I like to keep a pregnancy journal for each of my pregnancies (I'm on number 3); however, this journal was not at all what I wanted. Almost every page of the journal asks for a picture, but if you are anything like me, you do not find pleasure in photographing your body getting fatter and fatter everyday. What I do like to do is write about my feelings about the pregnancy and how things are going, but this book provides very little space for drawn out responses. The prompts are very elementary and generic; I like a little more mental stimulation with my journal prompts. On the whole, it is great for someone who does not want to write that much and who is more visual."
3,Decent,"This is a cool book. I found it a bit odd to have so many early pages for belly photos when most women don't even start to show until after 12 weeks. Those early photo pages are wasted in my book. It also doesn't appeal to a woman using a midwife, it asks the name of my OB/GYN."
4,its a wonderful way to track your pregnancy,this was recommended by a coworker and it was great advice. I love having a journal type to show my babies later on to see how much we were excited about this pregnancy and how my tummy grew!!!
2,I wouldn't get this book again,"I was excited about this book because it really documents what your thoughts and feelings are throughout your pregnancy. However, once I started doucmenting in the book, I found it asked odd questions (i.e. ""The size of you"") and wanted a picture for every WEEK your pregnant. Honestly, who takes a picture of themselves when they're pregnant every week? Plus, I had no noticiable changes until I was about 18 weeks! There are some pages in the book where you answer a list of questions, but at times I could only answer one, then had to remember to go back to that page to answer the other ones when applicable. The other downside I found is that it has a place to tape a picture of your sono's on, which I like but there is no folder in the book to put the sono's to store. There's only a place for 1 picture, but I have about 5 pictures from each sono. It would be nice to have a pocket or folder in the book to store them in."
2,Not What I Expected,"Although this book seemed like a great idea I felt as though there was not enough space to really write my own information. I really wasn't a big fan of it, although I did use it. It would have been easier to create a scrapbook of my own."
2,READ ME BEFORE BUYING,This book is not that greatBad prompt questionsCertainly the wrong questions for a second pregnancyThe trimesters are offIt is just boring
2,just ok,i wish that i could have veiwed this book from the inside before i purchased it i probably would not have purchased it if so just dont feel that it lets you keep track of a pregnancy that well
2,It's ok.,"The book is not so organized as I would like it to be, there are some things that it skips to and some I have to keep going back to fill in. It's ok."
3,Have book ready before pregnant!,"This book is cute in the format and the way it is made with the pages like a growing belly, BUT.. you should have it before you are pregnant. Since it starts you at day one. There are alot of places for pictures of you and your belly, (hince the name) Its an ok book. But to be honest it just wasn't the book for me, since I waited until I was past 12 weeks to purchase a book. I wasn't taking week by week photos so that would leave a lot of the book empty."
4,Recommend to any pregnant woman!,"I really loved having this book while I was pregnant with my daughter and I will probably get another one when I have my next child. It's very sweet and gives you silly things to answer and fill out, while giving you plenty of space to write out how you're feeling and what is happening in your pregnancy.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because almost every page has a huge spot (half page) for a belly picture to be placed every week. I didnt take belly pics every week so a lot of those spaces are blank but if you do plan on taking pictures, every week... this book would be a great place to display them!"
4,the belly book,Perfect book for first time moms who want to keep a journal of all events through out each trimester. Great book
4,Nice way to create a keepsake,"I bought this for my wife, who is expecting our twins in a couple of months. The book itself has great construction quality. It has a sturdy hardcover that fastens shut with a thin blue elastic band. We were both really pleased with the content inside as well, which includes a bunch of questions to be answered by the expectant parent(s), detailing thoughts and feelings throughout the pregnancy. There are also plenty of slots for photos, both of the mother and ultrasound pictures. There is a lighthearted tone throughout the book, so this is geared toward someone who is looking something on the more informal end of the spectrum. We are having a lot of fun filling this out, and think it will make a great keepsake about this time in our lives."
1,Not what I was looking for,"This journal just was not for me. I'm sure it is a preference thing, but I found a different journal that I was a lot happier with."
3,Ok Journal,"I bought this journal based on the positive reviews. It was an ok journal. I liked the prompts, but there was not a lot of space for my own thoughts, feelings, or observations. I didn't like the fact that trimesters do not line up correctly with the weeks. This book has the 3rd trimester starting on week 25, but it really starts in week 28. It would also be great if it had some pouches for keepsakes. Overall, it's alright, but I would not buy it again or recommend it to a friend."
5,Loved this book !,"I bought this book for my first pregnancy and now I'm buying it again for my second. It is the perfect week by week journal. The hardest part is keeping up with the picturing taking each week. But I was able to do it each week with #1 and I love looking back at it and comparing my belly size with #2. if you maintain it, you will never regret it. Good luck mammas!"
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!,"this journal was perfect for me! it was organized by week and had room for photos and other mementos. it was also designed in such a way that a full-time working, exhaused and often delirious mom-to-be could fill it out weekly and appear cognizant :-) i have just purchased it for a family member who is expecting next year! it was such a great hit at my baby shower (i brought it for everyone to read) - they all commented on how wonderful it was. most moms have a baby's 1st year journal, but it's nice to go back and look at my pre-baby journey too."
5,This book is soooo fun!,I looked in many different store for a pregnancy journal for my wife. I didn't find exactly what I was looking for. I got the belly book and the reviews were right. My wife and I are writing in it and it is fun to think our child will enjoy it years later. This was a great purchase and we will gift this book to other families to enjoy.
5,Great book!,"This book will help you so much to keep track of what goes on each week in your pregnancy. It's so awesome to look back on and see what happened because, if you're like me, when you're pregnant you forget everything! :o) My friend had this book and showed it to me so when I got pregnant for the 2nd time, I bought the book and am loving it! I wish I had it for the 1st baby."
4,Great book,This is a great book...get it as early as possible so you can start filling it out though...I didn't discover this book until my second trimester and had to go back through old emails and such to figure out what was going on some weeks but totally worth it. What a great idea!
5,Great book-read through the whole thing though!,This is a great pregnancy book! I love the space it has to write each week. I recommend when you get it to read through the whole thing and to look through it often though. The part about wearing maternity pants comes after your first trimester which I would have totally missed if I didn't read through since I started wearing maternity clothes at 5 weeks this time. I also would recommend photocopying or scanning your ultrasound pictures to put in the book because the ones you get usually fade if you have them exposed to light.
4,great souvenir,"This is a really fun pregnancy book. Its round shape reminiscent of a belly is cute, and the prompts inside are both pertinent and amusing. This will make a wonderful souvenir of my first pregnancy and will be fun to share with my little one when he/she grows up!"
3,good,Its nice for first time pregnant women. I wish it had more journal space. Overall I like it and would recommend it.
4,pretty good pregnancy journal,"I bought this for my second pregnancy since I kept a journal for my first one. I am pretty happy with it. The only thing I could do without is the weekly spots for belly pictures. I would like to have pictures but I don't need them for the first 10 or 12 weeks, so those spots are all blank. Also, the places for journal entries are very small, so if you are a writer, you might want to go with something a little different......"
5,Easily the best journal,"I was going to pick up the old bookstore standard ""The Pregnancy Journal"", but then I saw this one in a display. I love it! Not chockablock with pregnancy info, just a fun journal. There's a page for every month and some have special questions. Like, week 8, which is usually right in the middle or at the height of morning sickness: ""My complexion this week is: glowing? green?"" ha! There's also a ""Snapshot of my life"" for every trimester, where you record recent movies you've seen, books you're reading, top news story. Very cool."
4,Good journal keeper for baby,I like this book a lot. It has helped me to document each week of my pregnancy. I wish they didn't have a spot specifically for week-by-week photo though as we opted not to do that. But overall a fun book to keep tract of how you are feeling with your pregnancy.
5,The Belly Book,The Belly Book prompts a mommy-to-be to enter important details about the pregnancy like foods that make you sick and foods you have to have. There are also places for a picture of the pregnant belly from week to week. I can't wait to see the finished product once I have the baby in February!!
2,"Really cute journal, but didnt fit my needs","We tried to get pregnant for two years, and when it finally happened I wanted to document everything. I found this book and thought it was adorable. What a neat keepsake. But as my pregnancy went on, I realized that a lot of the sections didn't apply to me. There weren't enough spots for my ultrasound photos, I didn't have adversions, I wasn't sick, etc. So much of the book stayed blank. It's a great idea, but really check out each section and each page before purchasing."
2,Too rigid in its format,"I was given this book as a gift early in my pregnancy and I thought the format was too rigid. For example, there is only one page for each ultrasound per date, and I had several photos from each appointment. Also, it has pages for ""belly photos"" starting at week 1 when you aren't even really pregnant until 3 weeks into your pregnancy and probably don't know your pregnant until much further along.I ended up buying a photo album that had space on each page to write notes, and I can format the pages freely. I write notes on each page about doctor's appointments, cravings, and other milestones along side of my belly photos and ultrasound photos."
5,Journal,Another great journal during pregnacy but doubt daughter in law used. Wish I had saved for someone else! Nice idea.
4,very cute!,its super cute & very cool especially if you are busy & only want to record a little. its not a organizer tho but a fun memory record book!
4,Love the book,"The book is a great book for expecting mothers and it came well packaged. I would recommend this book to any expecting mother as it has fun facts and tidbits to fill in about pregnancy. So many books are about the babies and not the experience the mother has before the baby gets here. The only thing I was disappointed about is the shipping. I ordered this book on Dec 9, they did not ship it until Dec 19 and it did not arrive until after Jan 3! I know the holidays postpone shipping but this was ridiculous!!"
4,cute book,I'm glad I selected to use this book in documenting my pregnancy. It's witty and fun and sentimental all at the same time.
5,9 month pregnancy journal!,"The cutest little journal to track everything while you're pregnant! From the time you get that positive test until you bring the baby home you can track it all in here. It's so cute! Keep pictures, notes, cravings, etc."
3,"A basic, prego journal","I have to admit I took a chance with this journal and I'm a little disappointed. There is little to no room for reflection or for you to write down more that a sentence a week. It's cute in a teeny bopper kind of way.....not at all what I was looking for. For example it had 1"" circles for each trimester saying things like ""food I'm jonesing for"". Really?!"
3,it was pretty good,"First I have to say that I am not really 'journal' person so it's hard for me to write in something every day-I liked that this wasn't everydayI wish there were more pockets and places for pictures thoughIt does have some spots for pictures but they are fairly smallThere are no pockets to keep cards, etcOverall I like it, but I might try a different pregnancy journal next time"
5,Love it!,"This is such a cute, light hearted little book. I will love to look back at the photos and see what I have written! It's a wonderful gift idea for somone you know expecting. It was recommended to me by a friend and I'm so happy I purchased it!"
5,Great Memory Book!,I have bought this book for both pregnancies and loved it. It is so easy to use but allows you to keep up with journaling the pregnancy. I was worried about having time the 2nd time around but this book made it super easy. I'm now buying it for my newly pregnant friends. You will not regret buying this book.
4,Great Journal,"I bought this right after I found out we were expecting and I just love it! I also bought it for a gift for a friend who is expecting. My only complaint is that the spot for pictures is a little on the small side (regular 3x5 don't fit well, so I find myself trimming pix or ordering wallet size)."
5,Great!,"Great Book. I looked at three or four differnt journals/planners and my local Barnes and Nobels and decided this one was for me! The other ones where way over detailed while this is just a fun thing to fill out, put in belly pics and ultrasound pics. I think it will be great when my child will be old enough to look it over and see the timeline when he/she was in mommys belly.This would make a great gift too!"
5,LOVED IT,I actually accidently bought 2 and I am saving it for baby number 2. It was perfect and asked fun questions!
4,Belly Book Review,Good book for journaling your pregnancy as a keepsake for your baby. There are many prompts for what to write. There are also spaces for photos for each week of your belly and each ultrasound. It also includes space for possible baby names you have come up with and shower gifts etc. I would have liked to have a page dedicated to a family tree but there is enough space for me to make my own.
4,A great gift,"A neighbor bought me this as a gift and I love it. I used it all the way through my pregnancy and its already such a neat thing to look back on, I have bought it for other pregnant friends."
5,So fun!,"This book is so cute and so much fun! It is a nice change from the pregnancy journals of the past! Much more ""now""."
4,On my second,"I bought this journal for my first baby. It is pretty cute. It has pages for everything you can imagine. Most pages apply to most people. (Although, there are always things that don't apply to some people.)There is lots of room to write your weekly notes and notes about appointments. I bought a second book for our second baby. It was nice to go through the first one and remember everything I had forgotten about that pregnancy (because mine have been so different). I recommend every pregnant woman get a journal, even if its not this one :)"
5,GREAT KEEPSAKE!,"This book is great! Some of the negative reviews worried me a bit, but it's definitley a great buy! Very inexpensive, and such a wonderful keepsake. I like that there is plenty of room to write, but not so much that you feel like you will have a blank spaces. Some commented on having to leave previous weeks blank where they have pages for ""belly pictures"". But what I did was figure out the dates of each week after finding out how far along I was and putting pictures of me, daddy, or the both of us in those weeks; Unsuspecting soon to be parents! I really recommend this book and look forward to my little one being able to see how much love we had from the start! The questions are fun and modern, and as another reviewer mentioned they don't put an emphasis as daddy being a ""Husband"". They use words like partner, which is much more universal. Get this book, you will not be disappointed! It's fun to fill out and has a space for everything!"
5,Great present for a mom-to-be,I received this book from a friend when I was pregnant and it was perfect for recording details of pregnancy. I have been giving this as a gift to pregnant friends of mine and they love it!
4,Belly Book,"This is a great book to document your pregnancy in. I love that it has sections for your doctor's appointments, pictures, and how you are feeling. I do think it's unnecessary for them to have a spot for weekly belly pics in the beginning, as there is not often change at those stages. Otherwise, it's the best one I've found yet!"
5,This is my second belly book!,This is my Second Belly Book and I will use one for all my kids!! I love getting to look back and be able to share how my pregnancy with each of my kids.
1,WARNING - Do Not Buy This Player,"They have horrible customer service. If you have a problem with your player, you're screwed. To make a very long story short...I've had 4 defective players in less than a year.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
4,LOT FEATURES BUT............,"RADIO, VIDEO , PHOTOS there are so many features but you can read about those from reviews else where i tell you about the cons only. The quality of the joystick is not good thats why i dont think the quality of the mp3 is not good. This player has horrible music managment so just imagine i have only like 350 songs and i have a horrible time finding the song i want. if you can get past those two main cons you should get it."
1,Not worth the money,"Would have given this thing 0 stars if possible. My daughter received one of these units for her birthday. It looks nice, but, so far, it's proved totally useless. The Jet Audio music files that she selected on the computer won't transfer to the X5. The instructions in the manual are so poorly written as to be completely useless and there is no customer service phone number provided. Don't waste your money."
5,Ipod killer? I don't think so! Not even in Ipods class!,"I have been buying from Amazon for many years and buy an average of 30 times a year. This is my first review. I just have to leave it because the iAudio X5 is OUTSTANDING! Please don't get me wrong, I am a Ipod fan and think its a great player, but for the money, features, sound quality and ease of use for PC users, you cannot beat the X5.Only gripe I have you probably read on the other reviews, you must have that subpack that it comes with to charge or use the USB plug. If you don't have it your sunk! I bought a spare so I will always have one."
4,GOOD TO GO!,"great item. a little complicated to use but overall it is very nice. better than expected FM reception, get almost as many stations as on my car radio. softwhere was easy to use. if you just take the time to read the instructions youll be fine. ( im a man and i dont bother, i just push buttons.)"
4,"Awesome player, poor battery","This is a great player. Sound is great. You can add your songs on as if it were a hard drive. The video on it definately exceeded my expectations. As much as people say they won't use it, I found it a great feature. The only downsides are the battery life and cheesey interface. It is nowhere near what it is rated (14hrs). As expected, video eats away at the battery, but without video the charge was out by the end of the day. I know there is the x5l with a larger battery, but the player is huge and heavier. The interface is a bit cartoony. Where it lists the artist there is a stupid looking face next to it and the same type thing for album and title. There are also pictures of folders that just look dumb. As much as I hate to say it. Apple has the right idea with just a picture of the album while playing. If you aren't anal then I definately suggest this over any player. The little things like the cheesey pictures and battery life forced me to return it."
1,Warning - doesn't work with DRM files,"If you would like to use this device to listen to audiobooks, or basically with any DRM files, DO NOT PURCHASE!!!The company has a beta patch that supposedly lets Windows Media Player recognize the device but it does not work.I have no issues with this device for music, but the company claims that it will work with DRM files and it absolutely does not because the Windows Media Player will not recognize this device."
2,....Not so great.,"Be wary of the hype. My biggest complaints:-battery life is less than advertised.-navigation. the little stick makes finding and selecting something take a very long time and makes a sort of loud clicking noise.-the 'sub-pack'. A little piece that attaches to the bottom, allowing you to connect the power and USB cords. A pain, pointless, and easy to lose.-the power thing is not dual voltage. if you take it to europe, you'll fry it.-can't see the screen unless the backlight is illuminated, and to do so, you have to turn the volume up or down.-if something goes wrong (headphone jack in my case) it's almost impossible to find tech support.In my experience, iPods are just as obnoxious. I like the Creative Labs the best."
4,So Close to Perfection,"I have seen reviewers highlight the good things several times, so there is no need to explain them again. What is imperative for people to understand is the fact that it does not support ID3 tags.These are the tags that contains the information for each track. EVERY other popular mp3 player has this feature. This means if you plan to just throw in 500 mp3s in one huge folder on ths device, you are in trouble for trying to find what you need to play. What you need to do is sort your music alphabetically. For Example, on the device make folders like the following ""/S/The_Strokes/01_track_title"". The device WONT sort by artists, genre, Year, etc, due to the fact is lacks ID3 support. Will they have this feature in a future firmware upgrade? Who knows. Just keep this in mind."
5,iAudio X5 30 GB,"I did a lot of research before making this purchase. I must admit, I refused to buy an iPod because of the hype. I figured there had to be something better. I was right, and this was it. More features, as good if not better sound quality (upgrade the headphones. iPod owners should do the same. The earbuds that either come with are terrible. I got $20 Sony headphones that really did the trick). I have no complaints whatsoever about the format. Maybe those used to the iPod software would complain, but this is set up just like Windows explorer which I use every day. I haven't set up any playlists yet, but it is also friendly to do, as more than one program is capable of setting them up. I love this player and don't know how I got by for so long without it. I've spent so much money on CDs over the years. Now I can finally listen to them without lugging a huge CD book around!"
4,Awsome MP3 Player,"I have had this player for 3 weeks now and I love it. It is simple to use and has pretty good sound quality. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the silly adapter that is required to be used in order to charge it, attacth it to your PC and to do the line in recording.The sturdy all metal case is great for the units durability. The long battery life is great. You can get about 13 hours of continuous play with one charge. You also can move it from any PC to another in order to load it up with all your great music, movies and text files unlike the IPod that uses ITunes.If you are in the market for an MP3 player and you are considering a IPod, consider this player and buy it. I guarantee you will not be disapointed."
4,Carpets are great! Staples to install are cheap.,The carpets were exactly what we were looking for for our hardwood stairs. Our only complaint was the cheap staples that are supposed to be used to install. I would recommend just getting some double sided sticky tape.
5,GREAT!,"This was really cool and fun. I got this for christmas and there are so many of them!A comment to the other review: You and your kids probably couldn't see the litte, teeny, tiny brine shrimp/sea monkeys. Either that or you or your kids crushed the eggs. Maybe your water was too cold.Back to my review: This was a great experience and very fun!"
1,The sea monkeys wear dead.,I bought this product and when I put everything together the sea monkeys never came to life. It was a waste of money.
4,adorable clock,I got this clock as a shower gift last month. Very pleased overall with the clock. I took it to a watch dealer to have a battery installed and they were unable to put one in. They said i should be able to find a battery for it in a cheap department store. I wish it came with a battery so we could have set it up right away instead of having to scout around town for a battery.
2,Battery Drama,"Cute clock but the battery situation is crazy. Who in the world uses a size ""N"" Battery? When I purchased this clock for my son's room, I thought it would be like every other clock in my house and I had plenty of AA or AAA batteries. But when I got home and opened the box, I was shocked to read that it needed a ""N"" battery. Who knew they made an ""N"" let alone where to find one. I went to my local drug store, but no ""N"". I looked on-line to see if the ""N"" had a different name and found ""E90"", so I went back, and nope, not there. Since I threw out the box, I can't return this pain in the butt, yet cute, clock, so the search is still on for the infamous ""N"" battery."
1,Yawn....,"I've enjoyed some of Erskine's work in the past, but this one was awfully dull. The characters were vapid, the story lacked suspense, and I found myself putting the book down about twenty-five pages from the end... and never picking it up again."
1,slow needs to be cut in half,"I love ghost stories and this is no exception.This story was OK but I struggled to finish it. I listened to the unabridged audio version.When Joss Grant inherits a gigantic mansion (Belheddon Hall) in Essex from a mother she never knew, she and her suddenly-unemployed husband think it's a miracle.They quickly packed up their stuff and their young son Tom and move into their new large home.Great plot , but the middle dragged on and on. There was an exciting ending but the story easily should have been cut in half."
1,"Good beginning, atmospheric middle, dreadful last 50 pages.","It began well with interesting believable characters. It built tension throughout but the atmosphere was gone by the end. The plot petered out to nothing, no great drama in the conclusion just an anti-climactic squib where it was comfortably resolved with no great finale. If Barbara Erskine reads her reviews she should take note not to go on holiday towards the end of writing a book because that's how it felt to the reader. Where was Katherine's malevolence!!! one barely interesting paragraph?? You should have stuck with the mother Margaret, she was far more interesting and a better developed character to play the baddie."
2,Not What The Photo Shows,"The picture shows the yellow witch hazel bottle, but instead I was sent the witch hazel in the blue bottle."
2,Not a fan of the smell,"I haven't used witch hazel as a facial toner before, but based on the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. After a couple of weeks, I can say I don't really see that it has helped to soften my skin. And if I had known how awful witch hazel smelled, I definitely would've tried one of the many scented witch hazel products out there instead! I'm going back to using the Avalon lavender facial toner and this will go in the cabinet to try on bug bites in the future."
2,Not your typical Christmas movie,"A Jersey Christmas is not a good movie but it's not a really bad one either. The plot of the movie is a cross between Clerks, The Breakfast Club, and Get Shorty. Unfortunately whatever muses it pulls from these three movies are not up to par.There are a couple of bright spots and a chuckle here and there. Most of the characters are bland and uninspired. It's really hard to feel any empathy towards their plight. All that being said one of the bright spots of the movie is one of the girls singing a Christmas song and a former catholic leading a midnight mass for his fellow clerks. It could have been better but it could have been worse."
1,Awful. Horrible.,"If I could give negative stars I would. This is an awful, horrible waste of time. Do not pay for this movie. Don't even watch it if you can view it for free!This has to be the most awful movie with Christmas in the title that has ever been made.I am guessing that this movie was supposed to be thought provoking or politically profound in some way, but it is neither of those things. It is just incredibly awful."
4,Great Christmas movie in the tradition of Bad Santa,"A Jersey Christmas is a hilarious look at Christmas through the eyes of non-Christians. It's a great mix of dark humor and religious jokes, with enough heart to keep you rooting for the heroes all the way through."
2,Not a family movie,"Clever idea to make a movie about Christmas in America from the view point of poor non Christians. Not rated presumably because of the constant use of expletives and gratuitous sex scenes. Add the poor acting and the original good idea didn't get far, too bad. Not a family movie."
4,Jennifer O'Connor,"The title track is better than any single song Azure Ray have ever made. The album flows really well, as O'Connor's smoky voice suthes the listener into a dreamy fog. (how poetic)"
1,THIS CD IS RETARDED,Everyone who listens to this cd must have ALOT of time on their hands. The singer and the music are tasteless! All of the people who listen to this cd need to get a life or atleast go watch viva la bam or sumthing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If i could i would give it zero stars!!!!!!!!!!! I have more fun watchin grass grow than listening to this cd !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,TheMachine,"This machine was received promptly from Amazon.com.It says it is a 45 stitch machine... very misleading. It is only a 17 stitch machine. The difference in stitches is the length/width, but that doesn't exactly make it a different stitch.The manual also stinks... not clearly written at all. It took me over 2 hours to figure how to get from one set of stitches to a second set of stitches (you have to adjust 2 different knobs to get from one set to the next, but that is nowhere in the manual).One more thing that drove me nuts...This machine comes with extra feet... great! However, not all of the extras are listed in the manual... and the manual does not tell you which foot to use for which stitch... thank goodness I have a little knowledge of sewing.If you are a beginner, don't buy this machine. If you do, you will need to hire a professional to help you understand how to use it.Good luck!"
5,"A ""must"" for all serious Ayn Rand fans and scholars.","Now in a completely revised, updated, and expanded edition, Mimi Gladstein's The New Ayn Rand Companion continues to be a critically important, essential guide to the life and works of author/philosopher Ayn Rand. Gladstein chronicles and summarizes Rand's writings, presents information about her national and global impact (and the response to it) and provides the most comprehensive bibliography published to date. Gladstein is neither an Ayn Rand enthusiast or detractor and therefore takes a scrupulous, scholarly, methodical, and emotionally neutral approach to her meticulous research as she covers the complete Rand corpus. New materials about Rand's posthumous publications, the latest biographical information, and summaries of books and articles about Rand published since her death have been added to make The New Ayn Rand Companion a ""must"" for all serious students of her writings."
2,Interesting for Penney types,"If you are a longtime current or former JCP manager, you will probably find this book interesting as one viewpoint on the long slide into mediocrity that Penney took in the 90's and early 00's. Since I knew a couple of the players in the book and had briefly met several others, it was personally engaging for me. However, as an objective work of literature, the book is sorely lacking. Mr. Penney's personal history has already been done, and better. What I wanted was a blow by blow of what befel Penney the last decade. Mr. Hare delivers many interesting antecdotes and gives us copious editorializing, but no coherent structure emerges. If this was a work of fiction, I'd be saying it has no plot to follow, though Bill Howell is clearly the bad guy in this book."
2,Overrated.,"An uneven combination of sometimes unclearly written text, often intuitively unhelpful development (which might have been accomplished with considerably more brevity), and 'friendly' writing style. There are better presentations of the subject; here is a short list:(1) A good beginner-oriented approach may be found in Adams/Hass/Thompson ""How to Ace the Rest of Calculus"".(2) Howard A. Anton's ""Calculus, 7th edition"" contains fine introductory sections on the subject.(3) ""Vector Analysis"" by Stroud and Booth is an excellent self-study text and is written in a 'programmed learning' format.(4) An elegantly written short introduction may be found in the first chapter of Francis J. Flanigan's ""Complex Analysis"".(5) For a rigorous and very thorough development, Albert Shadowitz's ""The Electromagnetic Field"" is superb."
5,Best Intro to Vector Analysis,"If you want to learn vector analysis, this is the book to get. It covers the basics of vector calculus, inlcuding surface integrals, the divergence and curl of vector fields and gradient operators, as well as Stokes and Green's Theorem. Unfortunately, there is no real material here on tensors, which would have been helpful, but for all of the hopelessly confused math, physics, and engineering students, this item is a godsend. I used it to teach myself the subject while my professors were busy confusing me. A very clear, lucid and amusing introduction. Should be required reading for aspiring engineers and physicists."
5,"Clear, intuitive pictures for vector calculus operations","I used the first edition of this book during a vector calculus course at M.I.T. way back in 1980, and it gave me exactly what I needed. The book describes vector operations in a very straightforward manner, and gives an excellent sense of what Green's theorem, Stokes' theorm, and the Divergence theorem are all about. Since then, those sorts of vector calculus operations have never been a problem."
1,Also still waiting,"I also ordered this magazine for someone for Christmas. It never arrived, I don't think I was charged. I am going to try again. It may be the gift that never starts giving."
3,Don't let the fact that it's a 'coloring book' fool you,"This coloring book is not for children. This is why I rated it so low.This is basically a set of stories from the Bible and coloring pages from a Bible printed in 1479 in Germany. It would take a very patient adult to give credit to the page by coloring it.If you are looking for Bible Stories with illustrations for adults then this is a fine book. If you are looking for Bible stories that you can read to children and you, the adult are going to color the page, this is fine as well. But it really doesn't work well for children."
2,A Comprehensive But Slapdash Directory,"The word 'manual' in the title is completely irrelevant. All it really contains is loads of names, addresses and phone numbers. Information on some countries is scarce, some of it is obsolete. The most striking is the abundance of all kinds of printing errors. In some cases even large blocks of text are placed in a section where they do not belong, producing an impression of a complete mess!"
1,1/4 inch SS braid fuel line,"Returned the item as it was defective. The outer stainless steel braid is very flimsy and loose fittingover the very large outside diameter rubber hose. Th OD of this is disproportionately large compared to the ID.(I didn't measure it because it only took only one look to tell it was not a winner and was defective.)The outer braid was damaged before it was put in the manufacturers sealed plastic bag. Sorry, I don't recommend."
2,Very poor value,"I bought two of these MadeSmart adjustable trays, silverware and utensil, based on the good reviews. I guess people have very low expectations. If I saw these in a retail store, at this price, I would laugh and walk on by. My opinion is that these adjustable trays represent very poor value. Each tray is constucted of three pieces of plastic with a molded, rubberized surface in the compartments. The three pieces are held together with pins that are molded into the middle piece of the tray. Only the two outside compartments are adjustable. THe plastic is not all that durable, as mine arrived with a broken/missing corner (as did another reviewer). The fixed-size trays are a better value, at about half the price."
4,Great of organizing,"I like that this organizer has expandable slots. Unfortunately, it didn't fit in my drawer the way I wanted it to, even though I measured before buying it. It still works fine and my utensils are no longer a jumbled mess in the drawer."
5,Cute,"Very bright and cute. People at work love it. Love the rachet adjusting, very smooth. I would highly recommend this hard hat"
2,VERY POOR PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,"The Amazon listing shows a photo of a guy wearing a helmet, safety glasses, a blue shirt, and holding a chainsaw. The product description does not say just what is being sold. Probably the hard hat, and probably the hearing protection. Are the safety glasses included? Probably not the shirt or the saw. The problem is, the buyer has no way of knowing what is or is not included in the transaction. The gear might be great, but the sales pitch is lousy."
5,PATHETICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this toy as an early birthday gift and they could have made it better. His sword slashing action is slow and he looks as if he is just looking for merry or pippin. The paint is a little bit bisar and the paint of his sword comes off easy. If you are wondering why I got this it was because there was no legolas in stock at that time. And like the wolverine toy there are two many aragorns if you dont believe me then get one for yourself. I am 10 years old now. AMIR
1,F.Y.I the dumbets aragorn toy,"this aragorn is a dumb toy his hair that's hangs in his faceis just painted there, and the sword and dagger paint came off so quick I did'nt notice it, he's not even posable, this toy is not a cool toy he may look cool in the pichers but he not as cool as you think..."
4,Daughter Loves It!,"We bought this at the airport as an impluse buy for my 4.5-year-old daughter. She loved setting it up to ""play"" airport as we waiting at the airport. She's also has played it a lot at home. Fairly durable. Cute."
5,Excellent,Great product you must buy fom there hurry hurry great service great job this the place u want to buy
2,Christmas Present,"I am saving it for A Christmas present, perhaps after the Holidays I can tell you more. I only want to say that I was dissapointed, misread the description, I thought th large plane was larger.Mrs. G. Tompkins"
4,Interesting Late German Romantic,This music is much better & more enjoyable than the other review would lead you to think. Please see my review of the Vol. 1 of Boehe's tone poems.
3,Low-voltage performances from Karajan,"As a devoted Karajan fan, I can recommend this 1964 account of the Pathetique Symphony. It is, by far, the most committed performance here. The ""big tune"" in the first movement is most movingly played--better than in Karajan's 1971 EMI and 1976 DG re-recordings. Elsewhere, however, the playing is at times rather routine, the tension rather ""mechanical"" and low voltage. The same comments apply to these 1960s performances of the Fourth and Fifth. To hear Karajan at his most intense in these works, get the 1971 EMI set. The 1970s DG set features the most atmospheric and beautiful sound--especially the 1976 recording of the Fourth. The brass playing of the ""Fate theme"" is vastly more powerful and committed than the uncharacteristically sloppy trumpet and horn playing in the 1966 recording."
3,Karajan's 60s Tchaikovsky,"Karajan had neither Mravinsky's idiomatic Russian way with Tchaikovsky nor Bernstein's passion; he tended to gloss over much of the emotion in these symphonies and generally sounds rather bloodless. The one thing you'd expect to be really great with this recording, the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic, is unfortunately let down by the poor sound, which (like many DG recordings of the period, like Kubelik's Dvorak) is shrill, brash, and congested. I would recommend insteadTchaikovsky: Symphonies Nos. 4, 5, 6 ""Pathetique""."
3,Blandly bold,"For those who prefer a quieter progressive rock, these competently derivative lesser-knowns fill an expected position with acceptable production."
1,eh...,"Had I seen it in the store, I would have never picked it out.Far too big for my waist. It looks gaudy."
3,"Beutiful, too big for me.","The belt is beautiful, however, it is not my size. This item does not show size number. The belt is too long."
5,"Not as good as live, but worth the purchase","I just saw Amanda live at a local outdoor concert. The girl is an incredible fiddle player. She played nearly none-stop for 3 hours and ended the show with the same energy she began it with. I bought the CDs at the show and have not been disappointed. Most tracks are as good as the show, others seemed pushed. I've let my students listen to the CDs for several days now in my Louisiana history classroom and I still enjoy them. Check out her other CDs too."
2,Books Stuck Together,"These are exactly the same books that I read as a child. When they arrived, they were all stuck together. When I separated them, no matter how gently I tried, the pictures on the covers tore off and remained on the back cover of the book above it. I loved the idea of the set with a carrying case, but you would be better suited buying them individually."
5,It does exist !,"This is a book of poetry that I wrote some long time ago. It is a book of loves and situations of lovers that I dedicated each individual poem to ""ITS INSPIRATION"".The cover art is my own and depicts females front and back done in pencil. It was published in Greensburg Pa and was never reprinted. It should be a real collector's item.At first publishing, it was sold in Barnes and Noble since my friend was the manager. The higest price it ever was sold at was $6.00 and that seemed high at the time.It makes me laugh to see that there is a copy avaible and that it will sell for $25.00. I, myself, only have one copy and one copy in which I listed the INSPIRATIONS BY NAME!Enjoy..."
5,A great book!,"This is a wonderful auto-biography, that Virginia Mayo has written. She tells about her life on Hollyood and at home with her family. She tells about her beloved husband, Michael O'Shea, who passed away. Also about her daughter Mary whom she adores, and who feels the same way about her mom.The work as well as the rewards and joys of working in Hollywood during the Golden years. Also her book contains many wonderful photos of her. Such a large and generous selection of them. I am a big fan of hers, and she is a beautiful and talented actress. She is also very kind and gracious and has written an enjoyable and delightful book. I very highly recommend it to anyone. Also Virginia provides insight into other Hollywood stars and what they were like to work with, and the ones that she got to meet. Very informative and interesting. She is truly a lovely and kind lady."
2,hp cradle for pocketpc,"Received hp cradle(to recharge & update pocketpc) on a timely basis. When tried to ""sync"" with desk top computer, encountered trouble. Seems that MS ActiveSync does not recognize the device!!! After googling my problem, was referred to other users, -was given several work arounds. Still can not get device recognized by software. Only the recharging function is working."
3,"Informative, short,",Pros:InformativeSeems to accurate and up to date with their informationLots of hedgehog videoCons:Same info you could find on any hedgehog website.Short - 1/2 hourHas sort of a PBS feel to the DVD.
2,"Not terrible, but","if your thinking of buying this and haven't read martin amis' 'Success', don't bother. 'Talking it over' is similiar in idea and format to 'success' but not nearly as fun."
3,Rather amusing,"Being forced to read a book (and subsequently write a paper on it) usually turns me off - well, who knows, it may still. haven't written the paper yet. Anyhow, it's very clever, well written, and humorous. Some bits, like about the nature of reversibility, are rather insightful, but on the whole, the novel disappears from thought soon after reading it."
4,Middle of Everywhere,"As we prepare to assist in the resettlement of a refugee family, our group found this book very helpful in our preparation. Presented a broad spectrum of viewpoints to consider."
4,Excellent Information,"A lot of practical information about helping those new to the US, mixed with compelling stories of every-day experiences."
4,A very fine autobiography,"This is the autobiography of a Vietnamese Buddhist nun who spent her life trying to help people whose lives were devastated by the wars. Because of her close association with Thich Nhat Hanh, it is to some degree an informal history of his activities as well. One of the most interesting aspects of the book is her frustration with the American peace movement. Her life (and his) are both quite inspiring, so this is a challenging and uplifting book. I would happily recommend this book to anyone interested in Vietnamese Buddhism, the war and the peace movements, or Vietnam in general."
3,I liked some of them,"An array of cushions and pillows knitted in a variety of styles. I liked the multicolor ones- rainbow stripes, flower motifs, multi cables- they look very cosy and homely.I wasn't so keen on the plain ones- there's a beige one in hessian knit and a huge bolster in another texture sitch (looks like an awful lot of work for an unattractive result!)Maybe more of a library lend than a purchase."
3,knowledge 5 stars. Delivery is a fat zero.,"Liz Greene is a strong, worthy voice of modern astrology. She is not, and has not been the most riveting of writers. I've waded through her other works and have been glad I had the determination to do so, but can't say I've ever enjoyed her books. Love the knowledge.... but wow. Dry. Boring. I got this book knowing that I would face the same struggle, but I love to hear and read all different interpretations and information to add to my own knowledge. So, I got it. I feel tortured. This book has her extensive knowledge, but it is wrapped up in a writing delivery that exceeds her baseline worse. Convuluted. Hard to grasp. (ironic that it is neptune she is writing about). I got through it, but I'll never go back again! I couldn't rate her less than a 3 star out of respect for the knowledge but...whew... think twice."
2,Not Constructive,"While Liz Greene has a smooth writing style, it is unfortunate that it has not been put to more constructive use. She identifies some of the key characteristics of Neptune, but views them in an almost entirely negative light. What is worse, her descriptions of ""Neptunian"" people and problems are done in a condescending and belittling manner. Although she dismisses much religion and spirituality as Neptunian phenomena in a negative sense, her book offers no viable alternatives. There are few constructive suggestions given in this book for the supposed weaknesses of those with hard aspects to Neptune in their charts. Reading this book might lead some ""Neptunian"" people to think of themselves as being problematic and of little use to society, and could do more harm than good in many cases."
5,Liz Greene finally bottles fog and markets it!,"Liz Greene is a modern day astrological wonder! Among her many books and lectures, she has taken the fear and frustration out of the outer planets and their effect on the planet earth. She is the female messiah..just wait and see!"
5,Essential Read for True Crime Genre,"Hope this is the first of many collaborations for Zuckoff and Lehr in the true crime genre. Judgment Ridge is so insightful and thorough without being gruesome and salacious. Living in Southern New Hampshire, I will never forget the horrific murders of Half and Susanna Zantop. The book paid touching tribute to the lives of the Zantops and painted such a vivid picture of the lives of their murderers. I appreciated Lehr and Zuckoff for the sensitivity towards the Zantops family and friends and the respect shown the families of Parker and Tulloch. The authors did not point fingers but presented thorough research. Even though the outcome was known the details of the book made for a read that was incredible!"
3,Lot of details--too much actually.,"There's more information about the murders than you probably want to know. Deep backgrounds on everybody mentioned in the book. So it's an interesting story, but reading it is a bit of a slog."
5,Reviews (so far) ignore one detail...,"Andrew Patti and his young son were the intended victims. They survived unharmed. Why? One reviewer notes that Andrew refused to let the killers in his home. Very true, but he also pulled a gun and scared them away.One might disagree with what Andrew Patti did. One might argue it would have been better for him and his son to take their chances than to use a gun in self-defense.But why ignore the facts? Especially since the book opens with this very incident!FWIW, I grew up in Hanover. The Dartmouth community is overwhelmingly liberal; the surrounding community is not.-RC"
5,"Great true-crime book, packed with information","Two teenagers from middle-class families in a remote Vermont town brutally murder two well-loved professors who teach at an Ivy League college. How could this have happened? Why did they do it?""Judgment Ridge"" is true crime for readers who really want to know the details. By the time you're finished with this book, you feel you know the victims, the killers, their families, their lawyers, and the cops. That is exactly what I look for in a true-crime title.Well written, well organized, and engrossing."
3,A lot of good Information but not many great project ideas.,"This book helped me get started on Macrame with basic knots, but the project ideas weren't all that great and the pictures were so-so. It's instructions were clear, but the projects were not fun to do."
2,A good idea smothered by the writing,"I feel like I am breaking one of the commandments by giving a JCO book a bad review, but I did not like this book.I think the premise and plot were good, but I felt like I was wading in mud when reading it. The writing never seemed flow, never reached a good rhythm.If flow and pace are important to you when you read a thriller or suspense novel, look elsewhere."
1,Barren,"Set in New Jersey's famous Pine Barrens, the story is about a man whose nightmares link two murders 20 years apart. His connection to the second murder destroys his marriage. Unfortunately, the wife is a cardboard character, and the hero's hallucinations get tedious. I skipped the middle 100 pages to jump to the denouement, but neither the story nor the writing had improved. Not what you might expect from a literary icon."
3,Skip the italics!,"As a one-time admirer of JCO and Rosamond Smith, I found this book to be below her (their) usual standards. Particularly annoying are the italics throughout, supposedly there to represent the characters' thoughts, but for me they only served to confuse. The ending was too quickly wrapped up; no real suspense was evident, and the main character seems to be moving in a dreamlike state. I did like the description of the meeting between Matt and a computer nerd who collects facts about serial killings..it rang true. ""The Internet: the insomniac's solace."" The writing shows connections to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" with the killer using body parts to make works of art. Not my favorite work by Rosamund Smith!"
3,Hmmm...,This one had its ups and downs... you knew who the killer was from the beginning and parts of the story kept you reading on. Some pages you read just to get to the better parts. I love Joyce Carol Oates though and this one was a must read because of it. No regrets of course but be prepared... this is an ok read.
3,Repulsive and compelling,"There is something wrong with this woman. Who can write book after book of repulsive violence? There really is no need to go into such gory detail regarding the murders; it's just sick.The rest of the book is compelling. Each of the characters is an Oates stereotype, she can only write about a limited range of ponderous, emotionally unstable personalities. But the plot is interesting and makes for good reading.Without the disgusting details, it would be a much more interesting book."
2,first taste of joyce carol oates,"wow. i have heard so many good things about oates. it is no wonder why she wrote this under a pseudonym. what a turd. the protagonist was so unbelievable. the writing was confusing. who is this guy? who cares? after nine years of marriage he figures out he shouldn't be married...so he obsesses over dead girls. how goth! he finds out one is in ""love"" with him while never meeting him for more than 10 minutes. she dies so he chases and catches her twin sister. wtf? can't have the dead one may as well fall in love with a completely different person who looks like her.finally, and yet another stereotyping of visual artists. socially inept or sociopaths. really?? i expect this from bad tv sitcoms but not from an acclaimed writer. one artist: just plain of nuts--and a serial killer to boot, another: a womanizer who abuses girlfriends, another-the protagonist--need i say more...., yet another---bi-sexual-sleazy-wacky. and people give stig larsson grief?"
2,Miss-leading Image,"We thought this order included two bottles, because of the image. But it only includes one bottle.... VERY miss-leading! The title states 100 tablets, but the image shows a total of 200 tablets."
3,Chocolate Roses?,"I've been searching high and low for a soft, authentic rose scent. Hoping this was the one, I placed my order. It is obviously made with a cocoa butter base because, while there is a hint of rose, it is completely overpowered by the scent of cocoa butter. While not unpleasant, it is not the scent I want from my perfume. Disappointing, yes....but the search continues."
1,misleading description of product,The ad displays a strut mount and states STRUT MOUNT w/BEARING for $20.16. I ordered 2 units. When I received the order there where only 2 bearings and no strut mounts.The presentation of the product is totally misleading and should be removed by Amazon.
4,Good speaker,"The sub woofer is good, but the satellite speaker is not so good as the woofer.Sound quality is great for sure.Overall it's a good sound system.I like that"
5,Perfect gift for under $200,I bought these speakers for a friend whose speakers were fading in quality. He was absolutely blown away by its sound quality and the ambience it left in the room. I had to hear for myself to believe whether his remarks were true and sure enough the Altec Lansing speakers outdid the performance of my Logitech speakers. I am happy that he liked my gift.
3,"Not bad, but certainly not good.","After reading a few reviews, and having previous success with an Altec Lansing 5.1 setup, I bought this 2.1 setup. I should have paid more attention the the other reviewer who said it lacked midrange. Even with the two effects buttons pressed and the bass and treble tweaked, it still lacks midrange.For most people, this setup will be fine. But if you're the kind of person who has mid to high range speakers in your home theater, car, etc., you will easily notice the problems with sound reproduction.The control is nice, the remote is nice, but for the size of the sub you would expect more bass too. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not worth the trouble of returning them."
4,Altec F X4021,"My local power company burned out my previous Altec. This one has a smaller footprint, especially the woofer, which is 2/3 the size. The downward firing woofer isn't as boomy as before, but is far move even in response. The desk units have small footprints, can be attached to surfaces; I hot glued mine in the top of my hutch, making for very good dispersion and taking no desk space. I pushed the illuminated control to the very rear and use the handy remote control. Overall, sound quality is excellent for a bookshelf size unit. Bass can be increased almost to game levels. I use mine for classical music and while it's not as loud as my previous Altec, volume is more than satisfactory. Of course, bass isn't as deep as say a 12"" woofer. I think it's the best computer sound system available."
5,Great sound system for lcd tvs! A great value!,"Great all-around System! I have it hooked up to my 37"" Toshiba Regza tv because the tv sound is terrible. I didn't have a ton of money to waste on an overpriced theatre sound system so I got this! I highly recommend this system! The remote is amazing! It's small, sleek, and you know when you're adjusting something because the control base lights up and the led lights pulse either up or down depending on whether you're turning the volume/bass/tremble up or down.You need a 3.5 to rca cable to hook this system up to your tv but you can buy them online for like $3! If you're looking for a great sound solution for your lcd tv, look no further!Pros:-Looks amazing! Great design!!-Great tech support/customer service-Sound is phenomenal!-Easy to set up/install-Remote is so awesome! Small but powerful!Cons-Bass is way too loud?"
5,the BOSE killers!,"Went to replace my defective Klipsch speakers, and was really ready to buy the Bose. Looking next to them on the display rack, was this space-age looking Altec Lansing FX4021 setup. Not plugged up for listening, but there to get the physical dimensions. $10 off the $99 price tag didn't hurt, so after listening to the Bose series for a few minutes, picked up the AL's and went home. BOY was I glad I didn't buy the Bose! Everyone's beaming about the booming woofer, I thought the satellites were where the clarity was coming from. More important to me than thump, thump, thump. Will NOT disappoint!"
5,"Not superb, but good for the money","About what I expected. Excellent volume. Bass a bit booming, and mid range is week, after all the largest speaker not in the thumper is only about 2"" across. I'm sure the industry can probably do better, but it's going to cost much more."
2,Boomy and tinny,"For over a decade I have had a Monsoon speaker/subwoofer system attached to my computer(s). Recently one of the channels has gotten flaky. I saw this Altec-Lansing system on Amazon for a remarkable price. The reviewers seemed to love them, and the speakers were smaller, which would save some space on my desk, so I went for it.Unfortunately, not all ears are created equal, and I really hate the sound of these speakers. If find the low end very boomy, the high end very tinny, and the midrange washed out. I played with all the settings on the Altec-Lansing, on the sound card, and on Windows Media Player, trying to change the equalization to something pleasant. After lots of fiddling, I managed to get it sounding ""OK"" (to me.)Perhaps its just my ears, or maybe there was something wrong with the unit I got, but these speakers just ain't for me.So, I've sent it back. Amazon's return policy is a wonderful thing."
4,Great sound for TV,"I bought these for my computer but then upgrated my monitior I use for TV (Sat,Cable Ect..) and I ended up useing these for that they sound great and the SFX gives It a kind of surrround sound effectGreat buy @ 90.00 but then I had to buy Klipch Pro II for the computer and they really KICK A#$@$delived on time no problems"
3,sub-par,pass on this and just get the logitech thx set. its well worth it. the speakers are very cheap and the sub does ok. it just looks nice.
4,Very Good Speakers,"Got this speakers for 7 months and i have to say that are very good , sound is very clear, use them with my 32"" sharp aquos and the experience is amazing , only downside i see is with volume maxed out creates distortions.I purchased for only $55 on past black friday :)"
5,Wow,I got a bose with my fiance for $270 then challenged him to getting a much cheaper subwolfer speaker. Well as they say bose is always bose but in my opinoin this is the next to it. This Altec lansing is a very durable and sleek set of speakers and would recommend it to all.
2,poor sound quality,the system appears nice as a whole but the sound quality is poor. i suggest looking elsewhere.
3,"Ok for speaking, but not for music, unless very soft.","For the money, we thought these would be a little better, at least for music. You can't turn it up too much for music, because the speakers distort. Also, constant hum of this system rather annoying."
1,Exactly what's wrong with modern management,"This is perhaps the worst example I have encountered of terrible advice, wrapped in a package of nonsensical and even self-contradictory aphorisms. This is par for this sort of ""book"" (it's not a book, it's a pamphlet) - what is unusual is how violent the language of the book is... nothing like trodding over and destroying those who don't understand your vision for organization change. The book presents untestable hypotheses, uncited claims, and essentially no tools or mechanisms for actually doing the things they instruct you to do (not that anyone should do anything these authors suggest). If your organization is passing this book around, you should strongly consider whether this is an organization that values rational thought - and thus whether you should work there. Sad that you can't give negative stars - this book will hurt your organization."
5,Great little book!,We used this book as the basis for a day long discussion about changing the culture of our organization. It was used as a pre-read to a one day meeting. It facilitated a common language and concepts allowing us to cover more ground in a shorter time. I would recommend this book for any group looking to change its culture through revolution rather than evolution.
2,Sound is good but sturdiness problem,"Dropped it once to the floor and now it's not working well, turns off at a whim..."
3,good stuff :),It was alright! I gave it three stars because it was inherently a good book in the sense that if gave good pictures and good ideas but a lot of it seemed straightforward and common. BUT if you are new to the lesbian world this is definitely a great help!
4,Worth buying!,"This book was interesting to look through. Each position has a picture of two women posing to illustrate each position. There are positions for oral, finger penetration, strap-on, and anal sex spread throughout the book. A few of the positions seemed more like a gymnastic skill that regular people might not be able to do. Out of the 101 positions, only maybe 10 fit in this unrealistic category. Definately worth buying and having in case you and your partner want to try something new!"
2,kind of stupid,"We were excited to get this book, but I really am convinced it was written either as porn or the author was just messing with people. With positions where you are supposed to ride your partner like a pony while tugging on her hair seems really just stupid. And come on ladies, did they not have anyone to style their hair for this book. The early 90's bob has got to go. Dont waste your money on this one."
2,Recommend,It was a gift to someone as a joke following a conversation yet it ended up being well received and ad told it was actually entertaining.
4,Basic but a fun read together.,"My partner and I enjoyed looking through this book. Naturally some of the suggestions are basic and some are redundant but it was certainly a source of discussion. There were some postions that one of us or the other said, ""that isn't going to happen"" or ""hmm, lets try that"", so it was a way to know limits without awkwardly asking or being awkwardly rejected. There is a check list in the back and it was fun to go through together and check off what we've done. Though simple, it is recommended for couples who are open and for those that wish they were more so."
1,Boring athletic pornography -- no tantra here!,"This book was so disappointing I returned it immediately. It is basically a picture book with a couple of very skinny girls with porn-star expressions posing in a variety of very uncomfortable-looking positions to grind their shaved pussies against each other. The language reads like a cheap porn magazine -- I suspect it was written by a guy. I was looking for something more intimate, loving, and spiritual -- a more tantric guide for lifelong lovers. This isn't it!!"
3,Iffy,"The product was exactly what my grandmother wanted -- large buttons, good features. Unfortunately, the light for the display died within 4 months and there is nothing in the directions on whether or how to replace it. Now, my grandmother keeps a flashlight next to her bed to see what time it is when it's dark. She really likes it otherwise, and I wish this part of it had worked better."
1,christ,"filled with unstructured rambling, conspiratorial musings, and cherry-picked historical anecdotes to support a conclusion he pulled out of his ass. i was forced to read this rag in my international relations class. johnson is only a few centimeters above moore in his policy analysis yet my professor insisted he was a moderate. anyone who takes a logic class understands the danger of careless language use in attempting to form a cogent argument. all empires fall, america is an empire, america will fall. sorry, but the fact that, like other developing nations, we have military bases abroad plus the annexation of hawaii does not parallel america to the roman empire or even european colonialism."
4,Blowback,"Johnson rightly examines the unintentioned effects of American foreign policy. Keeping in mind that this book was originally written pre-9/11, his observations concerning Osama Bin-Laden are eerie. The book causes the reader to wonder what will be the consequences (blowback) of Bush's current foreign policy and war in Iraq."
4,Chilling,"Pretty terrifying insights into the CIA (who knew *NOT*), the United State's Imperialistic leanings and the flawed logic that drives them. I especially appreciated the author admiting the 1960s Hippies had more insight into Kissinger's true intentions than he did at the time. Not great bedtime reading but essential to figuring out how to shape our future foreign policies."
2,overdone,"Johnson has a good thesis -- there are consequences to foreign policy aims and the varying means by which those aims may be pursued. The problem is with his supporting arguments. Far too much of what he trots out to support his central thesis is very questionable factually, pure nonsense, or old canards. There is plenty of evidence out there to support his thesis. Relying on very questionable ""evidence"" severely diminishes his central argument. The book is not worth reading."
5,Fresh as the morning news!,"I would recommend this book to anyone thinking about America and our place in the world. It should be required reading for political science and civic courses. Too often it illustrates disfunctional government and the military industrial complex runnning the show. Read it, and do what you will. Your thinking can't help but be changed by the connections the author makes so very clearly."
5,DEWALT DC614KN 12/14.4-Volt 16-Gauge 20-Degree Angled Finish Nailer,"This is a great nailer for the price its great for home projects. Whats nice is that you can use your 14.4 v batteries from your other tools with out purchasing any more batteries. Do not use super saver sipping it can take up to 10 days just to ship, go with regular shipping."
4,Billie's Performance Saves the Day,"I would not say this particular set is very memorable only because the song selection is not the strongest. Yet 3 classics emerged from these recording sessions that became part of the Holiday canon: ""More Than You Know"" ""Some Other Spring"" and ""Dream of Life"". The last one written by none other than a teenaged Carmen McRae who worshipped Holiday's artistry. The rest of the songs are almost forgettable that Billie somehow manages to save with her exquisite phrasing and musicianship. Compared to the earlier swinging sides, the pace here is strangely slower and more melancholic. Billie does her best to save the drecky material and mostly succeeds. The sound quality is noticeably clearer compared to the earlier Quintessentials and her backup guys are as wonderful as ever, but I wouldn't say this is an ""Essential"" volume in the Quintessential series."
4,Worked as advertised with no problems,"I bought this modem to retrofit a older computer to make it last a while longer. The product installed easily, but the documentation is not very helpful. In fact, it was quite confusing in that the documentation covers all Best Data modem products, and the drivers for all products as well. If you are installing this to work with Windows 98 as I was, then expect to fumble around a bit with the driver choices.Nevertheless, I was able to get the modem working quickly and flawlessly despite the confusion. I haven't had a problem since.It is worth the price, and I would purchase another if necessary."
5,Pure magic,"What a great book. It's emotional, awe inspiring, and an absolute pleasure to read. We so often hear our Astronauts talking about the technical side of their work, but rarely do we get a look at the human side. If you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be on a shuttle, or just get a sense of the exhilaration of space flight, buy this book.It features short musings from many of the shuttle program's astronauts, and includes some of the most beautiful photos from the program's 20+ years.It's a shining example of how great our nation's space program is, through the eyes of our brave astronauts. Any fan of the space program should definitely add this book to his or her coffee table!"
5,WOW!,This book gives you KNOWLEADGE with great photo and captions with all!!Just order this book to find out what I am talking about!!!
4,Could hardly be happier with this Cd,"I thought that I was purchasing another fine Renbourn solo guitar CD....It really should be titled ""Duets with J Renbourn's Guitar""This music was recorded just before the ""John Renbourn Group"" was formed so parts have the same pre-renaissance, trad-folk flavor, but no repeated material. There is plenty of Tony Roberts' beautiful Flute on this CD with a bit of tabla and clarinet...reminissent of his early days with a pastoral/like jazz. Jacqui McShee does some background scat vocals on 2 cuts where her voice is used as just one more instrument.Unfortunately the Album design could not be any more bland & banal. But the music is much more than I bargained for.[This should be a 5 star rating , but I was not allowed to correct it.]"
2,I have seen Better!!,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of Roc Tien. I liked him in 18 bronze men. This movie was so bad, I just didn't get it. A man cuts off somebody's arm in a duel, another man acts like his body guard because he is his best friend and worse enemy(he wants to protect him in order to challenge him) and the man whose arm was cut off, wants to challenge the same guy who cut off his arm because he is the best swordsman in china???? What the......... This is as much as I can describe this."
3,The Euro in the Middle Ages,"Braudel interprets economic circumstance as premise and thesis for the historical development of Europe and subsequent motivation for expansion and conquest over surrounding continents. Were this reading a weather forecast it would read dry to luke warm. Otherwise, mediocre narrative, satutarted with mathematical rationale leave a tart taste in your mind that repeats on your sensibilities in asking: Did this historical narrative have any bearing on contemporary history?"
3,Able but Anachronistic,"Braudel's 3rd volume does represent a monumental achievement of synthesis of secondary material, but this is also its weakness. It's difficult to fathom that none of the reviewers would question Braudel's missing analysis of exactly how early modern Europe gained its necessary surplus capital to activate the commercial consumer behavior Braudel deems so key to the economy's development. Further, in his vague explanation of New World slavery, Braudel dismisses the whole institution as a ""historical bad habit."" Perhaps, his lowest moment is his defense of European slave traders because they introduced Christianity and metal tools to Africa."
2,A Contrarian Perspective,"Among the reviewers, I am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement. It is a mixture of facts and speculation, with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them. There is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded, and I have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be. In fact, this is a self-indulgent exercise in historical erudition. I don't care what anybody else says, this is a philosophy rather than history book. The author gives a lot of facts, but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts. The author tries to integrate almost everything under the Sun into this tome, and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information."
1,Bad Book,"I got this book because of its Directshow chapters. The book says ""Jumpstart Guide"" and it is true that starts describing basic concepts like progressive and interlaced frames. However, a few pages later assumes you know all about DirectX. The book tell you that all explanations about installing and interfacing filters are in the CD, but the CD, that is oriented to Visual C 5 and DirectX 4, doesn't match the book at all (i.e. the examples are different) and has even empty files. I don't know about the other chapters, but the Directshow and filter creation chapters are a waste of time. The Microsoft SDK is a lot less pain, assumes you don't know what they explain you, and it is free."
1,The examples don't work and the website doesn't exist,"I tried to access the website they list as containing more info about their book. It doesn't exist. I tried to access it because some of there examples don't work, and I wanted to see if any patches or bug fixes are available. But I guess I am stuck."
4,Good CPU Book and useful iformation of Multimedia APIs,"Have a great information about CPU and also Multimedia APIs,but the examples doesnt work and everything is writing in C++,I dont know why they didnt use C like Directx APIs are writing in C (Im Taliking about directx others are well writing in assembly!).Anyway im happy with the book but tend to Beginners."
1,The author of this book is a TERRORIST! I can't believe it!,"Refer to this link for the author Maher (Mike) Hawash. Yes, he is the educated software ""genius"" who his internal evil Muhammad woke up suddenly and started barking for Jihad! I can't believe what Islam does to brains!http://www.danielpipes.org/article/1195"
1,Badly written and untested,"This is one of the worse written technical books I have ever read. Examples don't work, and provided CD source code looks different than the code listings in the book. The book shows little snippets of the app being written, and it doesn't explain how these snippets relate to each other or how to put them together. Sometimes I had to write the code 1 line at a time, compiling, debugging, and testing after each line, so I could get it to work. This book proved to be very frustrating."
4,lovely,"I was there, in Verona.Beautifuly staged.Ferarrini at her peak.Much better than on Naxos recording.Classicaly cut performance.D.Aleksic"
4,Smart Psi Mystery,"This is a good mystery! The characters have depth and the main characters are very likable; the plot is tight and moves at a fast pace; psi/psychic phenomena are presented realistically, believably and with intelligence. The book is smart and fun."
5,A masterpiece!,"Hooray!!!A very fine Eomer figure.I am speechless so just buy him.run,hurry!He wont be around much longer so go to toys r us!I will end saying he is a masterpiece."
5,Not my favorite character but...,Eomer action figure is great!It has a sword slash that is a very original spring chop action.Its sword is very durable and his cape comes on and off very easily.There are no downsides about this action figure so buy it!
5,The best Eomer figure,This figure is so much better than the first figure. It looks like Eomer and it doesn't have a stupid expression on the face. He also has very nice armour on.
3,Not her best,"I have several Leslie Sansone programs and have loved them all. This one was OK but not the best. Of all her exercise products, the stretch bands for the abs are the best."
3,"Alright, but not my favorite","I love Leslie (she can be a little silly, but I think she's kind of fun). Anyway this is not one my favorites, it is a pretty good work out towards the middle, but the beginning & end are a bit to slow for my taste, I use 3-5 lb weights during this one. I do like the lower body toning session @ the end. Not bad by any means just not her best. I think it would probably be great for beginners."
4,A great add on to your collection,"I like this workout - would like to have seen more miles, but use other boosters to get my heart rate up. One downside was the fit cuff broke after Leslie suggested knotting it and I had only used it once, but her company was kind enough to send a free replacement"
4,"Review of ""Walk Away Your Hips & Thighs with Fit Cuff""","I enjoyed this DVD as I do all of Leslie Sansone's workouts. It is easy to follow and effective, especially for the lower half. I like the additional resistance the fit-cuff provides. My only gripe is that the tubing broke during the very first workout with it!! Luckily, I was able to make my own afterward with another tube that I already had."
1,Price is out of line.,"The Bear Creek mixes are unquestionably 5-star but at more than three times the supermarket price for the same products (NW Suburban Chicago), the prices are tantamount to robbery."
3,Too Much Pepper!!,"Really like this soup,but spoon by spoon-it gets hotter and hotter! Why in God's name did Bear Creek have to ruin this soup by putting way too much pepper in it? It's not necessary for them to add this amount of pepper to their mix-not eveybody likes this much pepper in their soup!If the consumer wants more pepper,they can add it themselves.You know the saying-you can always add it,but you can't take it out.SUCH a dissappointment..........."
1,"love the soup, not the price now","My wife and I love these soups but what the heck happened to the prices? I went back to a purchase of this same soup from 2009 and we paid about $23 for a 6 pack...now $44???Gimme a break...will keep looking...purchasing in a local store would be cheaper...what is going on, Amazon???!!!!"
1,"FYI, this is PASTA Pasta Potato Soup...","I made the mistake of picking up some of these a while back thinking I was going to be making bean soup, chili and potato soup? NOT. All those square hard little bits in there? They're onion or potato. They're PASTA. Yes, that's pasta, in chili, in navy bean soup and even in chili. Everything Bear Creek makes they apparently throw in these little square pastas which don't taste right in what they're in and which don't cook well in the time allotted. Without those pastas I'd be giving their stuff a bit higher review. Might even have liked it and bought these mixes again for the sake of convenience, but I'm sorry, that pasta in everything thing just doesn't work for me. There are some soups that work well with pasta but these three not on my list of soups I want to see pasta thrown into, particularly since you have to look REALLY hard to see that it's in there and the pics they show really don't look like it is."
1,Misleading color,"I ordered the nutmeg and returned it immediately as the color was better described as burgundy. The picture in the item description was the same as the one for the cocoa color so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but based on my understanding of the color nutmeg, the fact that the picture looked brown, and that the manufacturer was using the same picture for another shade of brown, it was shocking how far from brown the color actually was; buyer beware!"
3,"Fresh Snapper, anyone?","The old firm re-enter the dungeon and I feel as though I'm pinned aginst the wall of the Crown again. Loud? Yes. Heavy? Yes. New ground? Not really. It's a shame, but it only seems to set the bones 'a grinding when my brain's sliding into my boots.However, most of that with which we are faced these days in the guise of hard, thought-provoking music can't do that, so I say buy it."
3,"Assault in JMC style, not bad at all","Not bad at all, more aggressive than the earlier ""Shotgun Blossom,"" but really for those who like Jesus & Mary Chain, with a bit of the Cramps, Wire, Pere Ubu, and of course like any listener to any NZ band, the Velvet Underground. If JMC had never existed, this would've been phenomenal. Instead, it takes that template and pretty much drives it forward with little modification. The best songs are the opening and the closer; the last one has a great cardboard-drum effect reminding me of The Dead C at its best. The band, by now only a duo rather than the quartet that made ""Shotgun,"" is pretty much by this second release Peter Gutteridge's baby, and his long career in indie NZ rock makes for a professional, assertive, and visceral album, dimmed only by what came before it."
4,Ultimate Ice Scrapper Mitt,This is a nice stocking stuffer for Christmas. If you are scrapping the ice off of your windowshield in the winter and have no gloves this mitt provides a nice cover for your hands. The mitt is a little large but that means it will fit most hands.
5,Like them,I gave them all as gifts because I don't even own a car. But everyone really thanked me for looking out with something they found to be priceless!
4,great for winter in Buffalo!,Perfect gizmo for when you cant find your golves but STILL have to scrape the ice off the windshield! Perfect tool here!
1,Non existent quality control,"I ordered 3 of these scrapers. When received, 2 were absolutely filthy (and one of these was broken) and the third was defective (the mitt was stitched completely wrong). Beware...."
5,An incredible pick for artists at all levels of talent,"Mosacists will delight in an in-depth survey which covers the technical, cultural and historical context for creating mosaics. Goodwin's guide takes the form of an A-Z encyclopedia of techniques and creations, covering everything from mosaic history and technical details on mosaic creation to the entire design process. An incredible pick for artists at all levels of talent, working in the medium."
2,it's an encyclopedia.,"It's really an encyclopedia, and the description wasn't clear to me. I was disappointed. I couldn't tell that before I bought it."
1,"""Ain't that a shame"" THAT FATS ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN!","Fats Domino is a legend. His music is superb, and he is considered one of New Orleans' finest musicians.And it's real shame to see that Madacy has NO RESPECT WHATSOEVER for this legend. But then again, Madacy doesn't have any respect for anybody. This CD is disgraceful to Fats.The sound quality is terrible, just like on almost all of Madacy releases. Why Fats allowed Madacy do this to him is just amazing to me.Overall, buy 'Jukebox.' Buy any other Fats collection. But stay far away from this one.NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,Beautiful!,"""Dancing in the Streets of Brooklyn"" is a warm, beautiful story with authentic characters that have remained in my memory. Lurie avoids melodrama to tell Judy's story with sincerity and compassion. The author's roots in Bay Ridge give the book an authenticity that's refreshing. Not your typical wartime book, ""Dancing"" shows that while the years were difficult, they were innocent as well. Readers easily feel Judy's joys and sorrows as she comes to terms with the secrets of her past."
4,"Common-sense advice, for the most part","I bought this book to keep on the resource table my animal-rescue group has at pet adoptions. People often want to know what we think is the best breed for them, and I direct them to this book.The author is very honest. She doesn't mince words in the breed descriptions and flat out says of some breeds, ""This is just too much dog for the average family."" She also gives great advice about finding a good breeder.However, I find that she is a little unrealistic in her discussion of prices. She feels that some breeds, particularly toys, are ""overpriced."" I dispute that -- as the owner of a Maltese from a top-notch breeder, I know that most toy dogs have very small litters, and puppies are very difficult to come by. In addition, toy breeds often require more assistance with delivery than other breeds, thus driving up the costs of pups even further."
2,On the other hand...,"Apparently everyone so far thinks this is a great book. I bought 5 dog books recently and I found this one the least helpful. The pictures are small black and white. The information seems pretty generic to me. Otherwise, I guess it's all right."
5,"Seems like a wonderful book, even though some info may be off","I was told by the author not to get this book because it has a few inaccuracies, shush as what dogs are more available as well as health of the dog among others... I personally was just looking for a book to help me decide on if a dog is really good for me, and which dog would be best if so. This book fills my needs thus far :)"
4,"Very throrough, could be a bit more practical","This book covers just about every kind of dog, and has a great system for rating the type of dog that's perfect for you (for example, do you hate shedding? How much activity do you want the dog to have indoors? How much exercise will he need?) The one thing I have missed is ""availability"". For example, my ratings put ""Labrador Retriever"" at the same level as ""Keeshond"", but where on earth am I going to find a Keeshond breeder? And who knows anything about that kind of dog if he has behavioral or health problems, other than a specialist? This is really the only problem, and is one of practicality - on the the other hand, it is good to be thorough when deciding on your breed of dog."
4,Veryan writes enjoyable regency & georgian romances,"I cannot recommend highly enough P Veryans books. Sadly they are not very readily available in AUST. However if you're from the US that's not a problem.This is the first in the series, and I read it as a retrospective, not being able to find a copy until far past finishing the set.Although not my favorite, it is still very well written and engrossing.I would call it a delightful coming of age story, as the sister who is a cripple (and I hope I'm remembering this right!)finds that with love and away from the threatening sphere of Jean Claude she blossoms.Hmm not a very good review, but mainly I would like to urge you to read it for yourself.Follow with all the Sanguinets Crown & Golden Chronicles - PVeryan is GREAT!"
2,Un libro que tiene muchos errores,"I purchased this book to be used in a Spanish linguistics class. Intially, I liked the book because it was easy to read and understand, but I later discovered the second edition had several errors. With the edition of examples, charts and exercises came several evident problems. Overall, the book fulfills its purposes, but it has errors that can cause confusion among students. The errors appear throughout several chapters and need to be carefully noted to avoid confusion. There is an instance where terminology is switched as well as several incorrect examples of phonemes. The exercises lack clarity and need models or further explanation. Several of them made no sense to my class and my instructor. Overall, the book has a good purpose, but its errors need to be addressed."
2,Introduction to Linguistical Errors in Spanish,"I am sorry, this book has so many errors! The history of the language was interesting, and it does teach a lot of different points...however, there are typographical erros on about every 2nd or 3rd page! It seems like it wasn't proofread before it went to print.Furthermore, you cannot say ""del el"" together, it is redundant...many errors like this were committed, and students will be learning the wrong way.Also, some words are used that do not exist, it is just a slang or lazy pronunciation, but it shouldn't be written that way.Finally, I am not sure if the section on vulgarities was really necessary or appropriate for a classroom..."
1,Buy one that has a top to close,No cap for this. Small capacity. Must be emptied immediately. Not good if you are alone without help for several hours. Buy bigger one with cap.
1,"Repetition, repetition and more repetition","This is the first title from this artist that I've listened to. While he's obviously technically talented, I found myself asking, ""where's the art here?"". I purchased this CD based on Amazon's recommendation which, in turn, was based on my purchase of Nice Feelings by Pierre Bensusan (a fantastic piece of work).The Water Garden is repetitious to the point of tedium. The first cut, ""Prelude"", so repetious as to be annoying."
4,Great massive mask,"This is a great mask! Many people commented on how scary it was. As others have said it is massive and really almost too big to stay in place. Due to the flexibility of the mask and being stuffed in a box for shipping, the nose was mashed in and pointing to one side. It also does have a strong order as somone had mentioned. All these things can be corrected with a little advance planning. Take the mask out of the box and put it over some kind of form to let it hang and air out. I used a torchiere floor lamp. We stuffed tissue paper into the nose and bottom jaw to keep them filled out. I think if I'd then directed a blow dryer at it, it might have corrected the 'memory' the mask had of being out of shape.This is definitely NOT a mask for kids. Besides being too big, visability is horrible. All in all, it's still a great mask!"
2,Only got two useful sentences out of it...,"I bought this used, so I don't feel too bad, but this book seemed to be long on generalities and short on specifics."
3,"great music, unispired rap","This album has some really great sounds from all kinds of sources. Lush textures alternate from the far east to more of a latin feel, and touch all kinds of points in between. It's a very enjoyable album.Ubiquity label-mate Ohmega Watts' guest appearance is the lowpoint of the album. The two tracks he is on (especially track 2) are really just uninspired rehashes of things I've heard before. Having heard his album ""The Find"" in its entirety, it's safe to say that Watts is a far better producer than he is an MC.All in all a pretty good album with some skipable tracks."
1,Dead cultures,"Cultures were dead. Here are 17 more words so that you can be able to fulfill the submit button. 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17,"
3,British-style road comedy of France,"Two emigrants, of the USSR and Spain, crossed over somewhere in a French country-side.A Spaniard is naturally more sex-active and job-established, while a cone ""Russian"" is second-year studying the free world opportunities and landed in hospital, practicing a course.Than things changed and what, probably, links this very-British-multination-story-on-a-Fench-landscape with comedy genre is two these lads sitting at the dinner table surrounded by near a soccer team of kids this woman gave birth to from different males met.TOOOOOOOOO long movie."
3,Poorly Translated Title/Poor for Jimmy/ BUT....,"...the ending receives all the stars- WOW! otherwise this is a bit lower than average Kung fu film, and I am a Jimmy Wang Yu fan. The fight scenes are below average for the most part and only the last 25 minutes of the film are worth watching. This movie shows that comic relief is necessary in any good story (ask Shakespear.... actually a William S. Kung Fu movie would be a good idea... Macbeth has a pretty good plot for it!). Better one-armed boxing appears in the Master of the Flying Guillotine (spelling?)."
3,helpful,"Overpriced, but solid and helpful. One of those things you may never use again...I probably could have come up with something else to use, but this IS the right tool for the job."
4,good stuff,Solidly built and good quality tool.Bought this to aid in loosening the extremely tight crankshaft bolt on a 93 Toyota Corolla as i do not have access to an air wrench.Held the pulley solid with abit of extra leverage so all in all worked a treat.
5,does the job if adapted,"Removing a crank shaft bolt was getting to be a major challenge. Web sites that expounded the use of an impact driver did not help, this was on tight! As others have noted, the pins provided just snapped off, but by modifying a bolt with stacks of washers I could screw this clamp tight to the pulley and with several hundred foot pounds of force the tool held and bolt unscrewed. The thicker pins will probably work if you have bigger holding holes, otherwise get a screw that fits perfect and prevent bending of screw with a stack of washers."
1,Pin snapped at 100ft/lbs,"The pins included with the tool are junk. When holding the crank pulley and just pretightening the bolt to 100ft/lbs the pin snapped off.Yeah you could just bolt the tool to the pulley but really I got this with the intent of avoiding bolts and using the pins - which apparently cannot survive the torque that is needed to fasten and remove crank pulleys. The tool will work without issues when bolted down using some grade 8 bolts, but the provided pins are not up to the task of holding down a crank pulley which will always require high torque.In the end, if you got to go out and buy additional bolts to make this tool usable, you might as well buy 2 bars of steel and 3 bolts instead of 2 to make this very same tool for a fraction of the cost.This tool is being sent back."
4,Got the pulley off,I used this to remove the pulley off a power steering pump on a 1991 Honda Accord. It worked well and seems to be well made. I think it was a little over priced considering what it actual is.
1,Rantings of an opertunistic alarmist.,"Overly asserts that the end users of open source software are at great risk of being sued, unless those users are indemnified by their vendor. I firmly believe this assertion is entirely without legal foundation. But, don't take my word for it, read the position paper on the subject by Eben Moglen, attorney and professor of law at Columbia University. In my opinion, Overly is nothing but an opportunistic liar. Maybe he wants to sell his $90 127 page paperback book, or maybe he wants to sell his legal services, or maybe he is just another shill for Microsoft. In any case, I don't think Overly can be trusted. Furthermore, there is no reason to pay $90 for 127 page paperback book, when Overly has explained his case dozens of times, all over the web."
5,Superb CD's - MUST BUY,"Some of the best performances of Handel. The works are amazing, and stylishly performed. The harpsichord continuo (Performed by Valda Aveling and Brian Runnett on fine Thomas Goff harpsichords) is creative and awe inspiring. I've been searching for these re-releases for many years. These CD's are a MUST BUY"
2,Not as good as the remake,"My daughter loves the remake of this with Shannon Doherty. We bought this hoping it will be similiar. Not even close. She only watched the first five minutes of it. For an older movie it is very good, but when you are expecting something with more special effects....doesn't work."
1,Not quite what I expected,"This movie is obviously early 1970s before Kate Jackson was a big name star in charlies angels. This film lacked just about everything to give it a good reccomendation. The picture qaulity is not even up to vhs standards. On the other hand it did have an interesting plot and I was able to sit in one place while watching it. That is all I can really say except if you buy this movie don't expect much and you won't be disappointed, I would rather see an alfred hitchcock type movie than one like this though."
4,a retro DVD for jazz lovers,"This movie is exceedlingy hard to get, but worthwhile owning. The story is loosely based on the life of the great jazz saxophonist Charlie (Bird) Parker. Dick Gregory does an acceptable job in the lead role as Richie (Eagle) Stokes and the original music by Max Waldron has some bright moments. The DVD audio-visual quality is good. The search-for-scenes function could have more options. You must have a taste for jazz and nostalgia for the turbulent 1960s to really appreciate this movie."
1,GOOD WORK EDDIE,"eddie baker, you are such a good friend. What an amazing box. Good work, whoever was involved. Excellent box. A must for every u2 fan"
5,It is a good filter,"I was looking for a filter for my new camera. The UV filter from the camera shop is too expensive an d I'm glad I found this one. It seems to work OK with Samsung NX1000, so far so good.I'm glad that I got it."
3,Roll on applicator is problematic,"As another reviewer wrote, the roll-on applicator does not work well. It dispenses very little of the product. I am a big fan of this Sombra product, but the applicator needs improvement. I'll stick with the jars and 32oz bottles."
5,SOMBRA WARM THERAPY,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. ONE DAY MY NECK WAS SWOLLEN AND I PUTIT ON AND IT TOOK THE PAIN AWAY. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOWMUCH BETTER I WAS. I HAVE TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEY DIDNOT WORK AS WELL AS SOMBRA
5,The Best for releiving pain! I have chronic pain syndrome.,"I have used Sombra for many years, therefore I was excited to find your posting on amazon.com. Thanks for selling this product! This is a Great product! This helps me so much to get thru the day."
4,Great product,My husband learned of this product at one of the customers he delivers to. He had injured his shoulder earlier and the operator at the plant gave him a sample of this gel. It worked. We found here on amazon and have been using it since. His shoulder is healing nicely.
3,Not as messy but hard to get out of bottle,"I usually buy the jar, and while I like the product, the jar can get messy to use and hard to close if your hands are slippery from the product. The roll on sounded like a great idea. But, I find that it is hard to get enough of the product out with this method. I'll stick with the jar form."
3,Sombra Gel Roll-on,"I bought this product for my arthritic hands. I idea is great - I didn't want the product to cover my fingers as I was applying it so the roll-on fit the bill. The problem I experienced was that not always does the product flow from the roll-on head as I'm applying it. Sometimes shaking the bottle helps, sometimes not. Increasing the pressure on the head while applying doen't help. Hit or miss whether the product flows out so it can be quite frustrating. When it does, it feels cool and helps the pain a bit. Don't think I'd buy it again."
3,Effective but strange smell,"I am used to Biofreeze, but this was a better deal, so I decided to try it. It is effective, but I don't care for the smell. I am going back to Biofreeze."
5,The product is worth the money spent,This is by far the best topical pain relief product I have used. No messy afterward feeling. I will continue to buy this product. The only problem if there was one was how long it took to get the product in the mail.
5,Pain relief,"After surgery my physical therapist suggested sombra as a natural pain reliever. I used the same container for almost five years. Good relief, great value and natural."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I bought this on a recommendation from a friend...well it doesn't work at all. ICy hot, ben gay, and flexall work MUCH better. The only thing good about this product is that it doesn't have a harsh smell. I don't recommend it and would not buy any more."
2,The Isaacs?,Not really crazy about the new direction this extremely talented family has taken. Way too much drums and way too little bluegrass sound - for me.
2,not the original one!,"I bought 3 videos for my kids 2 to 4, years old. But unfortunately this is not the original pingu. They supposely have improved the filming and animation but actually they have complpetely lost the spirit and charm of the original pingu's."
4,Hilarious!,This DVD is absolutely hilarious. My 4 and 6 year old boys belly laugh every time they watch it. Pingu is as funny as ever. Give it a try! You'll love it! Mook-mook!
2,Noisy,"This Pingu lacks the charm the earlier releases had. Noisy and frantic, my 6-year-old wasn't impressed and neither was I."
4,Biomedical Informatics (Shortliffe et al),"A very comprehensive book that touches on the various hallmarks on how IT, Computer Science, and Healthcare services mingle with each other to formulate different scenarios and postulations of what is and what could be in how an industry is adapting to the ever growing field of medical informatics."
2,I know it was written by the Father of Informatics but.....,"Everyone in the field of medical informatics knows Ed Shortliffe. He has done a lot of pioneering work in the field. However, I think this book was just so-so. It is a brief overview of the field of informatics. I found it difficult to read - nothing in the book ""grabs"" me.I wouldn't recommend it, really. It may be worth a look because it is authored by Shortliffe."
3,Fairly interesting,"I met Don Lind a few weeks before Apollo 11 was launched. I watched him for years, wondering if he would ever get his chance to go into space -- he finally did. At the time he was in the astronaut corps longer than anyone else before actually going into space. He joined NASA in 1966 and flew in the Challenger in 1985, not long before the Challenger explosion.I longed to get a copy of this book.When I did, I was disappointed. It is a simple book. It is not as well written as it could have been. He often goes on tangents and soap boxes.However, the book has a lot about it that makes it worthwhile.Lind often shares thoughts about his faith, his spirituality and the Mormon Church. The Non-Mormon will occasionally grow tired of this, but most will admire his faith and his willingness to involve it in his life as an astronaut."
2,Color is wrong,"I love all things Harry Potter. I ordered this sign with the ""Leaky Cauldron"" metal sign and I love the metal sign, but my Hogwarts Express sign is not red but brown. I emailed the manufacturer, but never got a response. I was able to return it to the seller, as they said that they only had the one I recieved. But I really want this sign. I want the manufacturer to check their paint!!!"
5,Hogwarts sign,"I have hung my sign in my garage, with a bell suspended underneath (attached by string and glue gun). This way, I know just where to stop when I park my van (which just barely fits in my garage and resembles the Hogwarts Express)! There's educational value, as the Harry Potter series promotes the joy of reading."
5,Great for Harry Potter fans!!,"What a great accessory for my Harry Potter crazed, daughter's room. She hung it up right away. The sign is a good size and weight. Not at all flimsy. Nice product, could have been a little less expensive, but what can you do?!"
3,Best before the expiration date,I got this almost on the expiration date. It is best for 24 months. Mine was packed on 2007 and ordered and got on 2009 december last.
2,Expiration,"So apparently the product expires 24 months after the date on the box. I really wish they would point that out in a note somewhere on the box. For those of us who are used to expiration dates versus packaged dates being on the box it can lead to some annoyance. I normally have fair and clear skin, though it got considerably dark after a trip to the Caribbean. Any ways, I'm in the process of figuring out if the product works or not. I'll post up anothe review in a few weeks worth of time."
5,She loves it but.......,I got this for my two year old daughter. She loves playing with it especially the babies. What she hates is that the bottle is connected to Dora's hand and does not come off. I don't know why Fisher Price did this. Also the bottle will only reach one of the babies when they are in Dora's baby pouch.She loves it otherwise!!!!!!!
3,"Cute, but could be better...","I just gave this doll to my granddaughter as a belated Christmas present (had to return the original because the sound feature didn't work, no fault of the shipper), so whether or not she loves it and plays with it a lot remains to be seen. She's going to be a Big Sister soon, so she's very into that aspect of it.In my opinion, it could be much more fun with a couple of improvements. One, as others mentioned, the babies are made of very hard plastic, and would be much cuddlier if they were soft. Two, they're too big to fit in the cradle (and barely fit in the swing), and, since they aren't jointed, all they can do is lie stiff in the swing. I'm disappointed that Fisher-Price didn't put more thought and effort into this doll."
3,Cute product,"Big sister Dora is very cute holding her brother and sister, but, they don't do anything. It would be a better toy if the babies were jointed so you could pose them, but they aren't. Really the only thing they do is sit in the carrier, each with an arm up. The whole concept is cute and any Dora fan will like the toy."
2,Not really a good tank,"This is how you teach your children how to NOT care for fish properly: Buy them a 1g Mini Bow. Undergravel filtration sounds great, right? Maybe you're thinking that the filter intake is under the gravel, circulating the muck out of there and through a filter. This is not the case. This undergravel ""filter"" is simply a plastic grate that allow the poo to settle down to the bottom and not be disturbed so easily.Anyway, the poo is only removed from the water when you manually pour it out. And good luck with that too, because as soon as you start moving things around in the tank, all that poop starts swirling around! It will be a little difficult for you to save some of the clean top water for your water change, now that there's poop swirling!Besides all that, a 1g really isn't big enough for any fish, unless you intend on keep a very unhappy betta or something. Research proper fish care, and get something that has a proper filter on it. It makes your job a little easier."
1,Ramina's Review,This product is extremely hard to read and comprehend....wish I read the reviews before purchase....
3,"Not as good, but still worth the $$","This one is not nearly as good as the first one (Finbar's Hotel), but it is fun, light reading. If you plan to read them both, I would read this one first to save the better one for last."
3,In Support of Women's Writing,"I must say that unlike the other reviewers who all love Binchy, I bought the book because I have great love for Irish poets, and this book offered a chance to support the female writers.I was not previously aware of any of the other writers, and not overly knowledgable of Binchy's works, and therefore it was impossible for me to tell who wrote which chapter. I'm wondering if this can be an impediment to a writer trying to be noticed, that she writes a piece in a collection, only to have her name excluded from it.In any case, I think it was a charming book, better than I thought it would be. It held my attention throughout, and was quite touching in most of the sections. This is not really a serious read, but the stories interweave in an interesting way and the characters are unusual."
4,Delightful!,"This collection of slightly interwoven short stories will delight lovers of Irish fiction - particularly of the entertaining and wonderful Maeve Binchy type. (I'm guessing that she wrote ""The Wedding of the Pughs""!)The last chapter which involves a fading movie star and a tiger is the perfect comic end to these tales. I will now explore the work of these other writers!"
5,More great stories,More great stories from a women's perspective about a hotel in Ireland. Great stories about real people you would encounter.
2,TOTALLY CONTRIVED,"I felt manipulated reading this book, like someone just threw it together to make money. I love Maeve Binchy but this book can no way compare to one of hers. Another thing that bothered me - why do Irish writers always make a point of insulting Americans and portraying us as ridiculous? They seem to have an obsession with this country and its people and it bothers them enough that they always need to portray us ""ugly Americans"". There were several instances in this book where the reference to Americans had nothing to do with the story. Having long been a fan of female Irish writers, I am finished with them. They can insult me all they want, but I don't have to spend any more of my hard-earned American dollars on their work!"
1,Indecent behavior is not in favor,Story after story of indecent behavior made me sorry I purchased the book. I am so discouraged by the bulk of contemporary authors who think that graphic descriptions of sex sell books. I will never purchase their books.
5,a MUST read book!!!!!!!,"This book was awesome!! I just finished reading it & had to write a review to rid myself of my overwhelming emotions I recieved from it. It draws you in, starting at the very first sentence. Your head starts to whirl with answers to the mystery just as much as the main character's. It has the perfect ending and proves that true love, TRULY conquers all!!!"
5,I loved this book,The book Legacy of lies was really intiresting and i declare it one of the best books i have ever read!!!!!!!!!
4,good book but couldnt understanded it,One thing I liked about this book its keep you wondering whats going happen next is. I think once you start reading this book you cant keep your eyes off of it.When you get to a part in the book that's something good about to happen you keep on reading in more thing happen as you read the book.One thing I disliked about the book is that I didn't understand some of the parts in the book.Its hard to get some parts but overall its a good book. I would recommend this book to reader that like to read books that talk about murders and physic and mysteries.
2,DARK SECERT LEGACY OF LIE,Hi my name is Dasha an I'm hear to tell youabout a book I read called Dark Secret legacy of lieswritten Elizabeth Chandler. This book is about a girlnamed Megan who want to know her family history.Megan found out by her grandmother who shejust meant. This book is a good book. It has a lot of exoticparts .If you like sadness and love to guess then you wouldlove this book. I like this book because of the excitementand all the wild guessing. Another reason I like this bookbecause it dose not give away the ending and it never let youknow what going to happen next.
3,Has to be lingerie,This top is pretty but it has to be lingerie with the material. I also didn't find that it ran true to size. It runs more like a juniors size.
4,It is nice for the price.,"The material is not very nice. With all the lace it looks kind of like lingerie, or is it suppose to be lingerie? But for the price it is still a good buy."
2,kinda sad,"i dunno...maybe Mike isn't/didn't get any cash off these songs the first time or something....wouldn't be surprised. whatever the reason/s, this album frankly doesn't work very well at all. the new versions [take] the life out of some of these songs, and even the ones that manage to survive the process sound like they're being played by a compentent but uninspired cover band....which is kinda what's happened, here. ST's first & best is what you need...remakes rarely improve on the originals."
1,THIS HAS THE WRONG TRACKS ON IT FOR MP3 ALBUM,"THIS HAS THE WRONG TRACKS ON IT -MP3 downloads onlybe aware that track ten, Go Skate! (Possessed To Skate '97), is not the right one. It's ""Possessed"" instead.So I'm out one song from this great album. It's a fun redo of the classic track with the heavy Trujillo bassline throwing it's weight around on it.So far, I have no idea how this can get remedied, but be aware that this is not the correct version of the album. Buy the CD I guess.Otherwise five stars for it."
3,Punk?,"If you ask me, these guys do not sound punk. Aside from that, they don't even sound good. I admit that they have a nifty guitar player, but that doesn't change the fact that their music is... well... blech. There isn't much melody in the vocals, which kinda makes this album hard to listen to. Suicidal Tendencies sound like a cross between the Beastie Boys and Blue Oyster Cult. The lyrics are mainly political, with some stuff about personal issues. I give it 3 stars just for good lyric writing."
2,There are much better ways to spend your money...,"...and one of them is to buy a copy of the first Suicidal Tendencies album, which contains most of the tracks here. You might also get Join The Army, which contains two of the tracks on Still Cyco. Those two actually sound better here than in their original form, but only because the sound on JTA is atrocious. The tracks from the first album are immaculately rendered here, but along with the rough edges much of the passion that made Suicidal Tendencies such a great album is gone on Still Cyco.I originally bought this when it was first released. I got rid of it three months later."
2,Get the first LP Instead,"I Dont understand the reason for this release? maybe theyhad an album quota they had to meet or their wallets were a bit light,In any case,Get the first lp, its a hundred times betterI gave it 2 stars because the songs are great,it's just thereon another album."
2,One of the best albums and bands,Well lets just say that it became kinda hard to listen to this cd because of Mike's new voice. It didnt really cut it for this one. He really screwed up songs like I Saw Your Mommy and others. I think they did this because they didnt have that much access to the first album. I would only buy it if you're a huge ST fan
2,This CD clashes.,"A compilation of some good songs, but if you own 2 Suicidal CD's you already have most of them, arranged tastefuly, and dramatically correct. They don't belong together. Whoever put these titles on the same CD must have multiple personality disorder. If you are interested in a Suicidal sample platter, Prime Cuts is broader, but less mix-matched, and more fluid. Anyone who is familiar with suicidal's songs will recognize the listenability issues with this CD. Check out their better stuff [Almost everything] before you Send Them Your Money."
4,Interconnected Stories,"This is an interesting collection of short stories by Pradeep Jeganathan, a Sri Lankan writer. There are 7 stories all told, respectively, ""The Front Row,"" ""The Watch,"" ""The Street,"" ""Sri Lanka,"" ""The Train from Batticoloa,"" ""A Man from Jaffna,"" and ""At the Water's Edge."" The seven stories are all interlinked, with major and minor characters interwoven. It was quite compelling. Normally, a short story collection has stories about different by the same author. But in At the Water's Edge, the stories were all connected. I enjoyed reading it very much, and the stories themselves were interesting too.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"
1,Does not work with Dell Laptops,"I recently bought this for my Dell Laptop, but I could not get the driver to load. So I called their tech support, only to be told to return the card because it does not work with Dell computers. Why they don't put this on the package is beyond me, so if you're looking to use this with a Dell, look elsewhere."
5,So far so good!,"I have owned it for about a month. It came really quickly after I ordered it from Amazon. The price seems reasonable, the manual is a bit intimidating, but it's easy to make sense of the tool and use it. Just don't randomly pull levers when you remove the part where the dust is deposited, or you'll dump it back around the house!By the way, it does come with a lot of tools. You just need to get used to pull the metal pipe (the one ending with the handle) out of the corrugated pipe to use it with tools like a canister vacuum."
4,sucks good. costs a lot.,"it definitely does have better than average suction. it definitely does pick up what another vacuum, even a good one, leaves behind. it does a particularly amazing job on carpets. i am amazed and a little disgusted at what it gets out of my carpets.the pull out rod is a bit unwieldy. it is supposed to extend 17 feet, but it doesn't like extending at all. you pull it out and take two steps and the vacuum comes zipping into your toes. but you get used to it. only real complaint would be that the bottom is too big to get under anything, not the sofa, not the bed, not the space under the counter. that makes the rod necessary more than i'd like."
4,"great suction, awkward to use, clogs quite easily....","I have mixed feelings about this vacuum.It does have powerful suction, but it has clogged several times on me, which causes me to have to stop vacuuming, find the clog, dislodge it, etc...it's annoying. Also I feel it is physically awkward...particularly while using the attachment. I end up accidentally pushing the power button on, and turning it off while in the middle of vacuuming.I guess for the price I was just expecting a lot more. My canister fills up every time I use it, so it definitely is sucking up everything,(I have 3 cats, lots of hair!) There is definitely room for improvement."
2,"An interesting concept, but question usefulness.","A primer on reading and interpreting coding on medical bills, insurance company lingo, reimbursement issues, and a general how-to guide for the patient dealing with obtaining optimal payment from insurance companies for medical procedures. This book could be a valuable tool for the individual with limited coverage. However, the coding system is so overwhelming, with widely differing prices for what appears to be the same procedure. For example, I counted 15 different laparoscopic pelvic procedures for endometriosis. Determining what an actual fee should be based on this book is difficult. And it is doubtful you would find a doctor's office staff willing to explain why a certain service was billed under a certain code. A good idea in theory, but probably difficult to obtain."
3,This CD is OK,"I finally found this CD and when I first listened to it, I was some what disapointed. No Limit could have done way better than the production they had for this CD. Also, Full Blooded didnt have much of the No Limit family on this album. I would tell you to buy it if your a TRU No Limit Soldier!"
2,This CD was a big Joke,"I thought this CD would be good ,but after hearing it I really wish I wouldn't have bought it.There is a few good songs on the Cd maybe about 3,but besides that all the songs sound the same,just like almost every No Limit Cd out.I liked song 8 the best it had its own sound which caught my ear,but there really isnt to many good things about this CD.If you like No Limit I suggest Kane and Abel or Young Bleed, both these CDs are tight as hell, but I would pass on Full Blooded."
3,Could have been betta,"I'm a TRU NL fan and I buy all their albums. Full Blooded's debut is aiight but it needs some guest appearances besides the Hounds Of Gert Town. Overall, it's a good album. U just gotta listen 2 it a few times. Buy it!"
3,3.25 Stars! Da Hound Lays It Down!,"Man, on first listen this CD might be a disappointment to No Limit fans. The guest appearances are scarce and the production is not on the typical No Limit party style. Full Blooded, also known as Da Hound from Da Gert Town Hounds, waited patiently to drop this one. I actually don't know why it wasn't a full Gert Town Hounds album since they are on 7 of the songs as a group, though Full Blooded was the most talented one.This is like the street album of No Limit, cause even Mac had some party type songs. Full Blooded keeps it gutter with no love tracks or ughhh na na na type stylings. It works well, he's got the soul and lyrics to hold it up and I found this joint real enjoyable. But I can't front like the beats and lyrics are on some Tupac level so hence the score. This is getting me to buy his other CD though so if you like street ish peep this."
4,It Grows On You!,"Ill admit it, at first it was just ok to me but after a while I aquired an ear for the blood hound style and now I love this cd."
3,Could have been better,"I am a TRU no limit fan but this cd needed more people and more beats that go with him because on other cds like C-Murder,Soulja Slim,Big Ed,and the new Tru cd he is tight on those cds so do this on the next cd because Full Blooded can flow."
3,ITS OK NOT WORTH BUYING,I WOULD ONLY BUY THIS CD FOR 5.00$ NOT A PENNY MORE SO I HAD TO GIVE IT 3 STARS CAUSE ITS NO LIMIT AND THERE IS A COUPLE GOOD SONGS
2,It was one of No-Limit's weaker releases.,"Tracks number three and four have to be his best songs on the album. Although his song with Master P was fresh, the overall CD was not so hot."
4,Rocks the room...Not the neighborhood.,"This is an excelent system if you're looking for something to enjoy music in your bedroom or jam while hanging out with some friends, but don't expect to blow your dad out of his La-Z-Boy, Michael Jackson style."
4,Great speakers,Jbl Creature 2 - AluminumNice speakers once you figure out how to connect them great sound work great with my Imac 20in 2.1ghz with isight. Fast delivery Great Price
3,You get what you pay for.,"Price-wise, this is a good 2.1 computer speaker system. Despite the fact that I knew better, I went ahead and bought this system through Amazon before listening to it first. The sound from the satellites is very tinny sounding, for lack of better description. I have tried to get them to sound decent using the EQ in iTunes, but they still sound pretty poor. I would have returned the system, but shipping was too much to warrant, especially considering what I paid. If you want a cheap system that looks funky and plays loud, but only sounds OK, that is what the Creature delivers. Do yourself a favor though, don't make the same mistake I did. Go listen to these locally before buying."
3,JBL Adequate sound though not their best product,"For the price I got on this speaker set, worth the money. I`m a fan of JBL products and have had surround speker systems from the brand with excellent performance, not so the case with this product, a liitle disappointed. Now for the details .. Conectivity a 4, realtively easy to hook up. Sound a 3 because speakers don`t seem to be shielded, for example these were purchased to use with a Macbook and they are set close to the monitor so you get interference & crackling noise, moved from location a little farther (as much as I could due to space restriction) and still got some noise in them. Volume level is ok. Appearance a 4, the silver model is very cool looking. All in all an ok purchase for the money, they are recommendable, Note: make sure yo have enough space to locate far from the monitor."
5,"Great sound, size, price","The Creature 2 is priced reasonably. It's also pretty small -- the two satellites are tiny, and the bass unit is manageable. Out of this very practical size/price combination comes sound that is awfully darned good. It fills the room, and you can hear all the detail. The Creature 2 is loud enough to listen to the punk rock I like, but the sound quality is also good enough that I can appreciate the cool jazz I enjoy when it's time to slow things down. I get Creature 2s as gifts for all my good friends and they love and are impressed by them too."
3,Good looking,"It surely looks cool on your desk.But the subwoofer does not deliver the necessary base you need.If you have a local store where you can try, I recommed to do it."
5,Great Sound,"Although there was some confusion at first on this item being back ordered, when speakers were received my son was very pleased. He said the speakers sounded just as good on low volume as on high. The quality was awesome. As a college student the quality (and amplification)of the speakers is key. Also the compatibility of the speakers with computer, iPod, etc was a big plus for versatility. The people at Computer Brain were very helpful."
5,I feel robbed,"I'm Venezuelan so i felt very excited when i knew that Audioslave rocked Cuba. Today i bought the DVD and i was very satisfied with it...until i saw this page. I realize that the version of the DVD that i purchase lacks 4 esential songs. I don`t have in this original DVD: ""Spoonman"", ""Heaven`s dead"", ""Black Hole sun"" (my favorite Soundgarden song)and ""Shadow of the sun"".What a waste. I feel completely robbed."
5,Rock history in the making....,"This event deserves to be immortalized in rock history, not only due to the political tensions that had to be overcome in order to arrange it, but for the glorious spectacle that is the performance itself. Arguably the best band in rock today is standing in front of 60,000 Cuban fans (some of whom have never been to a rock concert before) and give the performance of their life. Audioslave's explosive sound is heard resonating through the streets of Havana. Tom, as always, delivers his signature riffs, with Tim and Brad maintaining the rhythm while Chris does his thing.The performance of ""I am the Highway"" brought tears to my eyes in what it meant in the context of the whole event."
4,A LOT OF SONGS ARE MISSING,"I was in this concert and they play for almost 3 hours.. there is a lot a song missing in this DVD, I wonder if there is out there the real concert with out editing.They play all the first two discs a lot of RATM songs and Cornell did a lot of solos with his guitar. they play also with some locals o bunch of songs.I guest they cant put it all for copyright reasons. still a good LIVE DVD to own.Get in to Cuba to play Rock is not easy, even if you are Cuban, Behind the stage is the USA Embassy."
3,I'm still waiting for it...,"I'm sorry! I'd like to review this title, but it didn't arrive at my hands yet. The deliveries are taking so much time..."
3,Want to rate it 5 stars but sounds awful,"Come on guys. Do you work with different people every time you do these things? Visual, not bad but not good. Sound - horrid! Reminds me of that awful Mexico City DVD as RATM. Olympic Auditorium was amazing as a DVD. My whole room rocks with that DVD. I also made the stereo track into an mp3 file since the CD release sounds funny to me. Anyway, Audioslave rocks but -5 stars for content - minus 2 stars for poor quality"
2,Audioslave,I thought the quality of this concert was horrible - I really regret spending my money on this dvd.
2,Poor quality recording,"1. This DVD is only in stereo. While I appreciate that it was filmed in Cuba, I still would have expected Audioslaves first DVD to be of a decent quality. I just really didnt feel that it captured their sound very well. When I compare this to some of the great DVDs (Linkin Park - Live in Texas, Coldplay live ...) - you just cant compare the sound or camera work.I am an Audioslave fan and I was just not impressed."
2,horrible performance for Chris Cornell,"I was excited for this DVD because I've never had the chance to see Audioslave (or Rage) live and I've been a fan of their music. After watching the DVD I honestly can't believe the band actually released a show with such a horrendous vocal performance from Chris Cornell. I've always considered Chris one of the top rock vocalists, but he is awful on this DVD. He is truly painful to listen to, especially since the band sounds so good.Audioslave should be ashamed to release this DVD."
1,Coked Out?,"I like audioslave.but they sucked bad and appeaerd all coked out.Imagine that coke In cuba... who would of thought.It looked as the whole band was (coked out).I wonder what chris cornell was doing while the band was playing the rage song..hmmm.Look in all there eyes and tell me I'm wrong.""game recognize game.""I don't mind rockstars being rockstars but film something where you had a great perfomance and not a crappy one. other wise I think your a studio band.your albums are still great."
4,Great for Audioslave fans,"This is a great concert for Audioslave fans. They are one of my favorite bands, and this is a great concert. Audioslave plays a set of around two hours. The set is great, but Chris Cornell cannot sing Rage Against the Machine songs. Fortunately, he only attempts one.I do wish the DVD was in 5.1. This might be a big issue for some, but I can live with it.I was disappointed by the bonus CD, as it only contains four songs, which Audioslave played for AOL. I would have liked to have at least some of the songs from the concert, but the CD isn't bad.All in all, if you are big Audioslave fan, you should own this. It might not be essential for more casual fans."
2,Cornell should get sober,"Seriously. He is so high or something, that he is spaced out, he can hardly sing on key, and he has no energy during the set. It ruined my image of Audioslave. I really love this band but what a waste of an opportunity to do something historic."
4,couldve been better,Truley Shows how talented Audioslave is i will not spend my time bashing on chris for not singing the rage songs like the rage singer.. as for the rest of the dvd shows how underprivilaged the cuban ppl are and how a band from the states could probably set off a revolution. Has a great setlist from soundgarden tunes to rage tunes... this dvd could have been a little bit better with more commentary from the band but all in all good dvd not a must buy but a curiosity buy!
1,5 stars???? On this DVD???? Come on.....,"Huge fan of RAGE, I am. Huge fan of SOUNDGARDEN, I am. AUDIOSLAVE...I am as well. With that said, this could be the worst music dvd I own. You would think that Chris could sing the GARDEN songs. Nope. You would think he could sing the SLAVE songs. Nope. The RAGE tunes.....NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!! Not the singer I'm used to hearing. Sorry folks."
3,Not very good,I was disappointed with both the video and audio. The quality just wasn't there. The band looked tired and uninspired to boot. I can only recommend to the hard-core fan that must have everything.
5,Amazing!,"First of all, I would just like to make a complaint to Jay D. You obviously know nothing about Audioslave or music DVD's. You really have no right to call Chris ""old"". He is a wonderful singer and a great man. Now, onto the review. What a great review this is. It was great to share a part in seeing the first ever concert played by an American rock band in Cuba. Some of my favorite performances on this DVD are....Bulls on ParadeSleep now in the fireBlack Hole SunCochiseOutshinedSpoonmanShow me how to liveWhat a great buy for any rock fan!"
5,I highly valued this replacement for a live performance in Cuba.,"Still my favorite band of all time -- Cornell and Morello bring tears to my eyes, as I close my eyes and imagine drumming along side Wilk. Heaven..."
3,Great out of water,The crank to make the cars move is hard to use while this item is floating. It makes it go under water by the pressure. So my kids had to prop it up on their laps so the whole thing didn't go under water. They loved playing with this toy outside of the water for about 1 week. My kids are 2 1/2 and 4.
5,Squeaky clean!,Our 4 year old son does not want to get out.Getting him into the tub is a breeze once we got this toy.(i now also take baths....hehehe)
4,alex car wash floating play center,My son LOVES the car wash so what more fun could it be to play CARWASH while taking a bath!
5,The Help I've Been Seeking,"This book helped me identify my anxiety problem (only recently I realized that I have an anxiety disorder) and already I feel better just having read it. It's an unbelievably anxious time and this is clearly making my anxiety worse, and this book provides the clearest road map to treatments, including medications and cognitive therapy and relaxation methods. I have really enjoyed reading it--my anxiety levels dropped just from hearing stories of people who licked their anxiety problem. It's clear and comforting--I couldn't recommend it more highly."
3,Ok for non-CWG readers.,"""ReCreating Your Self"" is based on concepts presented throughout the CWG series. However, it specifically elaborates on the ""Recreating your reality"" chapter from ""Communion with God."" I recommend reading ""Communion with God"" to fully grasp the enlightening process of recreating your Self.There I found the concepts to be clear and to the point; the concepts are not lost between examples and commentary. After reading ""Communion"" I immediately began to transform my life (yes it's a powerful read). Don't worry Walsch, I understand I created this experience."
3,"So, so...",I've read probably every book NDW has written but this one just didn't have the impact the others have unfortunately.
2,Recreating yourself,A disapointing crumb from the banquet of Conversations with God series. Save your money.
4,"Different, and in places sublime","I tend to like a more tightly structured, geometric approach to this music, but this recording has its own beauty -- it's definitely of a different era. Modern instruments are just fine, but I do find myself wishing for a recorder instead of a flute in #4 -- to me a flute is just wrong for this music. Otherwise 5 stars -- some passages move me very deeply."
2,Whats With the Noise?,A poor attempt at trying to join the Paslode market....the sound the tool makes is weird and sound like it is going to break. This is not the DeWalt I am used to seeing and using.
5,Awesome!,I am very impressed with this book and it is very informative. I was amazed to see how much there is to embroidery! I look forward to using the techniques I've found in this book!
5,Three Dimensional Embroidery Stitches,A fabulous aray of stitches to learn. This book is great for beginner and experienced stitcher who wants to hoan skills.
2,Pretty but not enough,This book is pretty but not enough information or patterns for the medium to advance embroiderer.
2,Three Dimensional Embroidery,I am not happy with the book. The illustrations are wonderful but where are the instructions. All you get are the stitches used not step by step. I tried to do the sunflower and have not been successful. I am not happy with the book
5,"Finally, The Recognition","It is regratable that great men are rarely aknowledge as so in life. Aristides de Sousa Mendes was no exception, but his acts were expeptional. This book was long due. It's finally here, it's very well written, a just tribute to a men of honour, and I thank the author for it."
1,Not Quite What I Hoped For,Sad story of an unlikable aristocrat who saved thousands from the Nazis but died in poverty as a result. Too bad this reads like a plea from his relatives for his back pay owed by the government.
4,Light,This is a very nice make- up mirror with a very subtle golden finish that looks lovely in a bathroom. I would just like the light to be a tad bit brighter though.
1,Beautiful...but doesn't last,"I've had two of these mirrors in the last 18 months. I love the way it looks. When the light quit working I bought the second mirror, thinking the 1st one was just a fluke. WRONG! Less than a year later, the light's gone out on the 2nd mirror. Won't buy Conair again."
4,Nice way to enjoy the green,"Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour is a way to make golf even more fun. It has a lot of crazy courses, tournaments, and head to head competitions against other players in singles or doubles. Also they have challenging events like hitting the ball through rings and hitting coins in the air. So this is a way to see golf like you've never seen it before."
4,Mario Golf Gamecube,Not much to say. Nice little Mario golf game for wiling away the time during winter snow days. I got it to replace a broken disc I already owned.
5,mario golf toadstool tour,i broke my old game and needed a replacement. i missed playing this game with the children we all love playing the game as a family.
3,ok game,"well this game was ok, but it got really boring after u beat it but if u play modes like ring mode you will have fun. but sometimies it really fustates you and it yakes an hour to beat a course. but if u like golf its a game to buy"
2,Mario Golf? or Mario Sleep - Fest?,"I have one thing to say about this game, BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING. This game is fun at first, but after 2 or 3 games, you never touch it again. I wouldn't buy this game, but I do reccomend other games i've reviewed like Dark Cloud 2, or Golden Sun."
3,this was a christmas present and aaa!,you migth and you might not get this game DONT GET IT!!! Im sirious dont get this game!
1,Sweet mario golf!,"I am the biggest fan of Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour. It is got the best graphics, and it has excellent gameplay. If you like golf and mario, this is the game to put on your ""for sure to get list"""
3,A GREAT GOLF GAME!!! a little short though,"Here are my thoughts on this improvement on mario golf. The graphics were just about the best I had ever seen on a Console system. However, I beat the entire game in about 4 hours, and the play modes where you went against one computer player were too easy, while frustrating at the same time. Overall I give it three stars. the multiplayer was fun, but the game was too short."
3,FORE a bore?,"This game may upset many people who will get this game. First off the music isn't what someone would call perfect backround music. Second, the number of players is again short (what's with that and nitendo latley?) Thrid you only get 2 boards to star off with. Fourth it gets boring after 10-15 minites or even LESS! This game WAS NOT A THRILLER~"
3,"If you like golf, this is a golf simulation","I was a bit surprised by this game. I had expected a whimsical game, but what you get is a serious golf simulation wrapped around the Nintendo characters. If you like that sort of thing, then this is for you. It is very easy to pick up the controller and start playing, and for advanced players you can exert more control without a lot of training. All in all, though, this is just a golf simulation with Mario characters. Might be fun with multiple players, but the single player game got boring pretty quickly."
5,Awesome!!,"This game has the best graphics on gamecube. The courses are challenging, fun, and unique. It has many more players than the 64 version. I knew this game was going to great after seeing screenshots but it is far better than I imagined. This game is a must for your collection it will keep you entertained for hours, go out and get a copy you wont regret."
4,its good (who am i kidding) ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!,Mario golf is an instant classic!!!!!!!i rate these things for a grade:choice in characters: A+realisticness: B+multiplayer: Afunniness: B- (there arnt a lot of funny things)funness: A+overall: AA must have!!!
4,A+++,The game is just like old-school Mario .. it has all the characters we are used to seeing in the Mario games. It can be a little confusing if you have never played a golf game before. Overall good game.
1,Very Smudgy,"This eye liner is not worth the price. By the end of the day, the eye liner I had applied on the top lid had smudged to lower lid."
2,"Cute, but that's it!","I bought this for my 6-year old daughter who loves Ariel! It is a cute toy, but I found many things that I don't like about it. First of all the chariot does not stay attached to the dolphins. Every time my daughter plays with it, it comes apart and then she gets angry. Secondly, our star button on the side is supposed to play the music and make the chariot light up. Our botton doesn't work. The lights and music on her chariot appear 'stuck.' It keeps playing over and over until my daughter just turns it off. So, it is cute, but try to get it on sale as it is not worth $35.00."
2,Poorly made!,"I don't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy. I agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter! Also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time. All that being said, she loves it!"
2,Poorly made for the price,"I bought this for my 5yr old grandaughter against my better judgement and my judgement was correct. Not only do the dolphins not stay on, the clasp on the carrage which would hold Ariel in her seat broke and we needed to use a rubber band to hold her in. In all not a great toy and I definately would not recommend it."
1,Do not buy this for your old Cybershot digital camera.,"The battery fits, yes...but when the camera is turned on, a few seconds later the words ""for Info LITHIUM battery only"" will appear before it shuts off automatically. It does not work, at least not for my camera."
1,Worst textbook I have ever had,"This book is an awful, overpriced and repetitive textbook. If you are thinking about using this as a textbook for your class, stop and find a better book."
4,workhorse for literary alchemy,"this book is fun, well written, and detailed. most useful for literary and artistic readings of alchemy, or ""comparative religion"" type studies, less so for detailed info on the protoscientific aspects (try Lawrence Principe). I'm using this book for a class on alchemy I'm teaching this semester. It's a good way to approach the rich terminology and symbolism, though it can get a bit repetetive as the same idea gets explained in different ways in different articles. Could have better footnotes and cross-referencing, but very useful for the casual reader or beginning student who is just becoming familiar with a confusing and difficult set of terms and images."
4,A Dictionary of Alchemical Imagery,"Each entry has been made sufficiently complete and independent of the others, with detailed cross referencing. Entires on key concepts - the prima materia, the chemical wedding, the philosophers stone, Mercurius, and the stages known as the nigredo, albedo and rebedo - provide basic information about the main ideas of the alchemical opus for those unfamiliar with alchemical theory. Recommended as a general introduction to the subject.See also:Arthur Dee: Fasciculus chemicus, translated by Elias Ashmole (English Renaissance Hermeticism, Vol 6)"
5,AWESOME BOOK,WHEN I PURCHACED THIS BOOK I WANTED A BOOK ON ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLISM. THIS BOOK HAS COMEPLETLY OUT DONE WHAT I EXPECTED. THE ONLY THING ABOUT THE BOOK IS IT IS VERY ADVANCED AND USES TERMS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IF YOUR NEW TO ALCHEMY. HOWEVER THE BOOK IS INCREDIBLE THOURGH. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK TO USE IN COJUCTION WITH OTHER ALCHEMY BOOKS.THE PRICE MAY STOP SOME BUT IF NOT IT IS WORTH THE MONEY.
4,Worth it for the unreleased tracks alone....,"A good collection of hits plus two tracks you won't hear anywhere else from their unreleased album in the 80's. They recorded an entire album of new material, and the record company didn't like it because they strayed from their ""ballad rock"" style, so the album remained unreleased. The two tracks from that unreleased album are worth the price of this rare import two disc set."
3,2-Ton Floding Cherry Picker Review,"I have not used the crane yet, but I can discuss the assembly instructions. The BOM for the hardware was different from the actual hardware. It was difficult to identify which bolts went where on the crane (a safety issue if you put the wrong bolt in the wrong place). The assembly diagram was low quality and difficult to read. The unit does not have operating instructions. So, for us amateur car mechanics, we have to proceed with extreme caution since we do not know entirely what we are doing.On the positive side, the crane appears to be of high quality but only time will tell."
5,If you enjoy quiet flute music this is for you,"As with all music CD's it is best to pre-listen to what they are selling before you buy, because joy is in the 'ear of the beholder'. But this one is as advertised, well done and can be enjoyed by a wide audience."
4,Traditional Japanese Music,I liked this CD. I happen to be a flute player myself so I am fond of the shakuhachi and this particular type of traditional Japanese music. The music is very plaintive and meditative. The melodies are pretty and relaxing. I like to listen to this music to help calm myself down.
5,Love this product! Fun for any kid who enjoys cars/roads and it keeps the house organized!,"Love this product! Fun for any kid who enjoys cars/roads and it keeps the house organized! Easy to wipe clean, fold up, and store. Price was the cheapest on Amazon!"
1,A week after Christmas...,"I ended up throwing this mat out, as the printed design, which is made of a thin plastic sheet, cracked at the seams, and pealed right off. My grandson did have fun PEALING it off the mat though! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,Great concept - not a strong enough material,I bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Xmas - - it worked great he loved the colors and rolling his trucks over the mat. I also loved how it folded up to store all the trucks when his attention diverted to another toy.The unfortunate part is it now has a rip in the seam and before long will be thrown out or used only for storage cube.
4,Grandson's favorite place to drive,"We purchased this for our grandson's second Christmas. He immediately enjoyed pushing his ""Matchbox-size"" cars around the mat, accompanied with his versions of motor noises. A year later, he still plays on it and likes to remind me to stay on the marked streets if I choose to take a shortcut through someone's lawn.The concept of the mat is very good. A vinyl surface that is simple to clean/disinfect and the ability to be folded into a carrying case for toys etc. is again, very good. Although ours has held up very well for about 18 months, the surface material would probably not stand up to aggressive play or toys that might pierce the vinyl."
1,"Great idea, Poor quality","I loved the idea of this product. I thought it would be fun for my son when we traveled, I would put some of his toys inside and then unfold it and it would be a clean fun place for him to play. But after only having the mat for a few weeks and a few trips the mat is starting to fall apart. The vinyl lining is coming off and tearing. It is a mess.I hope to find something similar but more durable."
2,Not a great mat...,"I am not thrilled with this product. Others might like it, but I find it too bumpy and just cheesy. The color is good, but my kid, who loves roads to play cars on, is not interested in using this at all."
3,"Great for a while, but completely falls apart.","This was better in concept than execution. The papery-thin coating flakes and peels off after a few months of use. I tried salvaging it by gluing the pieces back on, but it can't be. It is an adorable town and the fact that it folds up to store toys is a wonderful idea. Wish it was sturdier."
4,No brainer for boys who like cars,"My two yr old son happily plays with this 10-20mins at a time. With two dozen+ little cars this gives him a good playground. The imprinting is good, so far it holds up well, and for the price you just cant go wrong."
4,Nice and tidy,"We got this for our 2 year old daughter and she seems to enjoy it. I like that it folds and can do double duty for storage. We've already had to wipe food off it and the vinyl made clean up lickety-split. The only thing I find a bit odd about it is there are actually pictures of trucks and cars drawn on the roads. So, when our daughter drives over the car pictures with the wooden cars we bought her, it's a bit strange (""It's OK to run over the ice cream truck honey""). I think it bothers me a lot more than it bother her."
2,Very nice in the beginning,This toy is great in the beginning and we love that it can fold up and was easy for us to travel with it. We would fold it in a box and use it to carry toys when we went to hotels or grandparents houses but it does not hold up well at all. The whole top starts peeling up if it is played with very much at all. I am so disappointed in this product especially for what I paid for it! Very cheaply made!
3,using it for almost a year,my son loves this mat / bag! (he is now almost 4.5yrs old now) we gave it to him last Christmas and it is flaking off but its still awesome to fold back up and have a place to store all the cars and he doesn't get to upset about it peeling here and there!
2,Mighty Tot 1 Car Mat,I was dissappointed in it. It is alright but not what I expected. It also is hard to make it into a box like it says and won't really hold many items inside.
4,Imagination,"My kids love this durable, washable mat. Even my little girl likes to play with cars on it."
2,"Road wear, lol!","Although my boys love love this ""road"", my littlest (8 months) is able to rip off the top part where the road folds are coming apart at the worn seams and he has eaten the plastic, choked and thrown it up. I glued the seams tightly when I noticed this was starting to happen, but obviously to no avail. We love it so much I want another one, but surely would like a better product. If I wasn't around for a few seconds, he could have suffocated."
2,cute but flimsy,I agree with the other reviewer..this mat while adorable does not hold up well at all. I have a very gentle 3 year old and I finally had to throw out the mat b/c so much of the top had peeled or torn off. It is very poor quality. Invest in something else that will last!
3,they seem to do the job,"I bought half green and half blue treads for the winding wooden stairs that lead to our bedroom. We have two big arthritic senior dogs who have some difficulty getting up the steps, so I bought the treads mostly for them.Instead of using the enclosed tacks, which would not have penetrated our hard wood, we bought a couple rolls of two-sided carpet tape and used that to affix the treads. It's been about a week, and so far, so good. The only problem I have with the treads is that they do show the dirt easily (we live in a rural area, so there's lots of that). But that's a minor quibble. I think they'll do fine. They're not all shaped exactly alike, but then, neither are our stairs, so that wasn't a big deal either.As for our dogs, they seem to have an easier time now using the stairs, but it's not a dramatic difference. However, I feel better knowing that it will be harder for them to slip and hurt themselves with the treads in place."
5,A great read,"(Full disclosure--Frank Heavey and I played soccer together in high school.) I had a very hard time putting down ""Dying to Sea,"" and finished it in just a couple of sittings. Heavey manages to create a sense of tension early and maintain it throughout the entire book. If Hollywood isn't already interested in this book, they should be. At no time could I predict where the plot was going. Details that come up early in the book figure into the plot later on in a way that always pushed me to think hard, but were never so complex as to be impossible to recall. A great read, whether or not you know the author!"
5,Mystery on the Cape,"Set in Chatham, Massachusetts and areas of Boston, Dying to Sea has all of the elements that make up a great book, including mystery, suspense and intrigue. The author does an excellent job of connecting you to the characters as he vividly describes their distinct personalities. You feel as if you know them personally. I enjoyed this book immensely and I have been recommending it to everyone. This is a perfect summer read, I could not put the book down!"
1,This is an out-of-date program,"My nephew, now a Ph.D. candidate in math, LOVED the early version of Math Blaster I gave him when he was in Kindergarten. I thought that my twins who are first graders would also find it to be a fun way to practice the math they are learning. I was disappointed when I discovered that the software, which was advertised as being ""for Mac,"" was only compatible with a much older OS than OS 10.7. So we are not able to use this."
1,Torn in 2 weeks in city driving alone!,"Installed new shocks for the rear of my 1999 Toyota Sienna van; bought these boots to protect my investment but 2 weeks after installation, upon inspection found both boots to be torn. I am driving only on city highways and suburban streets but could not figure out how it was damaged like that. Will try to call for a refund or replacement but I would NOT recommend buying it based on their advertisement ""Made from bright, durable rubber to maintain color and looks in grueling conditions""... It just doesn't meet what it promises to be."
2,Can't remember what it was about!!,"This was a very light read. I was very disappointed. I don't feel that the authors spent much time at all on these stories. Sandy Blair's was okay, but could have been bulked up a little. There just wasn't enough there. I read one of the other ones (I don't remember which one), but I only skimmed through the last one. It was about a fairy or a wood sprite or something. Karen Marie Moning does otherworldly stuff far, far better. I should have just waited until her next book comes out. This book really was a waste of time."
3,Oh snap they killed Lee I min,"Um not going to go all over this flim it was a good fighting flim, but not in the traditional sense because there was no training to beat someone at the end of the flim. I didn't like the fact that my man lee I min got killed in the end. His fighting style was so smooth and nice but he died in the end he basically carried the film cause the other guy was always a step behind in finding the villian. so there"
5,Weller 6966C heat gun,My old one finally died after 18 years. This is a great heatgun for most small heat shrink projects up to about half inch tubing.
3,beutiful,"the book has a very unique design and a lot of nice photos, while the content is absolutely magnificent.i bought it as a present along with the Duke Elington masterpieces box set since Vian was inspired by Indigo Mood while writing his masterpiece Foam of the Day.I am thinking to order another copy of the book for myself."
4,"Good, but not great.","I purchased 5 of these for my workplace. One has failed within 3 months (wavy lines) it's geting replaced by asus for free of course, but I can not complain about the quality of this card on the other 4 pcs. The dead card only has wavy lines on the display, so it's technically not dead. The employees do not game, so I can't defend asus's statements, but I do know that it's a great bang for the buck. Quality is great for the price."
5,husband loved the Shotshell Belt,"I bought the belt for a Christmas present for my Husband. He absolutley loved it. I was concerned it wouldn't be large enough for him but, it was perfect. And as always, Amazon was quick to rush it out to me. That's why I like Amaxon. I never worry about not getting mt purchases on time."
4,amazon,"you will probably laugh, i didn't buy the belt for hunting, i have lower back pain, bought it to use as a back bracethanks for askingjoe/s"
5,Outstanding product!,I got this for my nephew who is a duck/goose hunter. He loves it and no longer has to throw boxes of shells in his pack adding to the weight on his back. He could not be more pleased and I plan to get one for myself prior to next duck season.
5,duck belt,"i've received things from Allen before. for the price, they are one of the best on the market. belt is no exception. absolutely pleased."
3,Remarakbly detailed but ... 3.5 stars,"This is a remarkably detailed account of the last of the Cathars in and around Montaillou circa 1320. Where this person was, when; who slept with whom, what they ate in this town and that. He gives a good account of the basisc beliefs of the Cathars. What is missing though is as much about what they thought or felt. And some of that is available, from the same copious records Weis uses. Ladurie's book Montaillou for instance includes snippets of conversation, where one of these characters sarcastically rebukes another. That sort of insight is mostly missing here.I think Weis got lost in the detail, or the main thread did anyway.An honorable, good book, but not an exciting one."
2,I am perplexed.,"I got my hands on a copy because I wanted to see if it really was written by Polanski, and I'm still unsure: no one else's name appears on the cover, but would Polanski really take the time to adapt his film to the novella form, or did he just hire a ghost writer? My advice to Polanski fans: see the movie, skip the book. It's almost a word-for-word adaptation of the film (written, surprisingly enough, in the present tense). The film makes for an interesting (if somewhat misogynist) experience . . . but reading the story without benefit of the imagery or pacing of the film proves to be rather dull."
5,medications of Parkinson's disease,"This book is available for free download at www.pdrecovery.org, a non-profit organization that supports research on Parkinson's disease.The website also has other information and publications available for free download."
5,"Am happy with these, are the only cases I order","I have bought these @ stores only to open @ home and find some of the cases cracked, broken, ect.Have been ordering these for a while from amazon & didn't know until today that my previous product reviews did not ""go thru"".I have never had even one case cracked / broken from shipping and I like that these cases are smaller than the ""average"" case a CD or a DVD & in some cases a data disk, too - these take up less space and I love the different colorsFirst time I ordered I was hesitant about these arriving in one piece as just from the store some were cracked / brokenThis has not been the case and I order these frequentlyI would recommend these"
4,Verbatim 94178 slim CD/DVD cases,"This is the second set of these I have purchased. I have been completely satisfied for their purpose. I prefer the color variety vs clear plastic. As I have never used a labeling or lightscribe option on the disks I've made, they may have an adverse impact on reading thru the color tint."
2,Defective Jewel Cases,"Verbatim 94178 Slim CD and DVD Storage Cases, 5 Assorted Colors, 50-Pack2/5's of the top portions of the jewel case covers which holds the CD and DVD liners have the connections that secure them to the bottom portion of the CD and DVD cases, which holds the CD's and DVD's, have connectionsbroken off on one side or the other."
3,Arrived Broken,Hard to say what this product is like. I received them and did not open for over a month. After I opened the package they were all broke. A lesson to open your items as soon as they arrive.
4,"Good quality, need more consistent packing and shipping","Like some other reviewers here, I like these cases, but had broken ones at the hinge point for several of them straight out of the box. The broken ones were at the outer edge, so it seems evident it was due to lack of care taken in packing, shipping and/or handling. Might be nice to have a more protective container, but then I'd guess they would cost more. Still worth it with a couple broken."
4,???,"The jewel cases arrived in perfect shape. The reason I did not give it five stars is because this does not come with paper cover labels, so I have to make my own. I also could get jewel cases (Memorex, that come with the labels) at a better price at Sam's, if I had a membership."
4,Worth the price.,At about 23 cents a case you cant go wrong. I use for DVDs and music cds and the 5 colors are nice to organize your disc. The packaging was fine for me and all my cases were intact. Great product!
5,In five colours!,Wow! These cases hold CDs. They come in 5 colours. They arrived unbroken. What more could one want? Why are you still reading this? Buy them.
5,RAMON MUJICA,"BUENA CALIDAD LOS RECOMIENDO,ESTA CAJA DE ALMACENAMIETO PARA GRABAR MUSICA ES MUY BUENA Y ADEMAS DE VARIOS COLORES SE BEN MUY BIEN."
3,poor warehouse handling?,"Storage cases should have been fine given the fact they came packaged in bubble wrap. However, the first 4 red cases I pulled out were smashed. My guess is they were broken in original packaging before they were even pulled from the shelf to fill my order. I actually needed 50 storage cases for my project, but I ended up with only 46."
5,less than 15 bucks for 50 cases?,"They are plastic.. they protect yo cds and dvds. WTF? They are under $15? How can you rate this less than 5 starts? Do the math, us consumers win with this one!Thank you amazon!"
4,Quality as expected and they get the job done,"These are not for heavy duty use like the original cases for DVDs or CDs would be but I expected that. In other words, they're flimsy but they do what they need to do: store CDs and DVDs. None have broken (yet?)..."
5,One of the best deals around,"I do a lot of home recording, and like to burn old fashioned audio CDs for car listening.These slim CD cases are wonderful. They are sturdy, have a place for a front insert, and hold up pretty well. They can take a pretty good beating. The colors are just icing on the cake. Highly recommend."
5,Storage for Less,Good price! Colors a good thing!Shipped in a good packaging container and meets expectations.Many Many Thanks! :) Mark.
4,Good cases,"Although they're a little flimsy, they are actually relatively durable for ""slim"" cases. And hey, they keep my uncased CDs organized!"
3,Nice Price,Nice price for these. When I opened the box up I found that one of the cases was broken:-(
5,I got what I expected,"Service was quick,Product was intact and in excellent condition. Cases have held up well over 6 months now. This is being written as I am re-ordering more."
1,Good if...,"I had bought a 50 pack at a store about a year or so ago. They are great if you buy them locally.Needing more, I thought I'd buy them through Amazon because they are cheaper. It was a false economy. While I had very few broken when bought from the store, buying through the mail is a different store. When I opened the package, about 8 were cracked. Over the past few months I've had them, I've discovered more cracked ones. You have to be very careful with the cracked ones or else the will break and be useless."
1,Buyer be ware,"While this product may seem reasonable in price, I found the construction quality to be poor and easy to break. You must open and close each case very carefully to avoid breaking off the tabs that hold the two case sides together and the case can crack very easily."
2,Cracked and Damaged Upon Arrival,14 of the 50 cases were totally broken and unusable. The tabs broke off keeping the top cover attached. An additional 11 or so cases were salvageable and I had to use them out of necessity. However little slivers of plastic had splintered out of the top and bottom spines of the cases.I dont know if they were damaged in shipment or were damaged to begin with... either way I was disappointed with my purchase.
2,Disappointed,Some of the cases came cracked. Most of them do not close securely and some of them didn't snap shut at all. I threw out 10 of the cases so far.
3,"Arrived Broken,",Two of the cases arrived broken. The packaging (air bags) did not prevent the contents from rattling around and damaging several cases. The rest of the cases are fine. The quality is not the best but it dos the job.
5,As advertised,I bought these to bring an order up to the free shipping thresh hold. They were well packed and in good shape.
2,several cases were broken when received,"Bought 50 and 5 were totally broken in the box. I'm pretty busy and didn't get a chance to open the box right away. I needed cases for basketball games we are recording for player review and have only pulled the cases out of the box as I need them. I thought it was only the first five that were broken, but each one I've pulled out since has had a hinge broken or had cracks of one sort or another. I through the first five away as I'm just too busy right now to go through the whole return routine."
5,Great Product,Very sturdy CD cases and lots of colors to choose from! Product was delivered on time as promised.
5,CD/DVD Cases,"They stay closed very well, opening is not always the easiest but that is because they lock well!"
4,Good slim cases,All cases shipped and arrived un-broken. Basic slim cases with color to sort if needed. I just use them to protect my archived computer files / documents / pictures / movie discs. Work as they should without any issues.
2,Damaged,I received this product and sent it back because it was damaged in shipping. Amazon gave me credit as soon as they got it back. I will try to order this again.
2,Too Expensive for How Quick it Died,"We paid about $[...] for this slide, and I honestly wouldn't pay over $[...]. My kids literally got 3 uses out of the slide (in one season), before it wouldn't hold air any more. My oldest kid is 5, about 41 pounds. The other child that used it is 3, about 37 pounds. I could not have both of them on the slide at the same time without it deflating.The other problem we had was that we could never get the water positioned quite right to make them go fast. Several times my kids would lean against the walls of the slide, and they would fall off. It was probably about 6 feet high. Luckily they are though, and got up laughing. I would have hated to have a trip to the hospital.We have purchased 2 more of these from Banzai, and they are better quality, better material, and the designs are better. Please keep in mind that those slides only seem to last a season, but my kids have not fallen off, and we get 20-25 uses out of them easily."
3,Bad Deal on this winch,"You can buy this winch cheaper than this Amazon ""special"" price at about a dozen places on the internet. And, for those of you kinda new to ATV winches, this is a low-end winch. For $80-$100 more, you can buy a quality winch that will be easy to install and operate. IMHO."
4,excellent resource for the other-half of the name-givers,"This book covers a fair bit to help play the Ork, Troll, Obsidimen or Dwarfs in Barsaive. The graphics are crips, the text is, for the most part, interesting, and the information provides a good, in-depth understanding of hte cultural forces that shape the psyche of these races inviduals."
2,"Works decently for a while, then caused display issues","The KVM worked well for a month or so, but recently it has been causing display issues. When I route my display through the KVM, I now get a strange scroll / refresh issue on my monitor that looks like dark lines scrolling upward. I do not experience this issue when connecting the monitor directly to the computer."
2,Looking forward to better someday,"I totally agree with the reviewer, Sor Fingers, that the transcriptions are wonderful but the playing is abysmal. Very noisy and distracting, though a non-guitarist might accept it as normal. Hopefully, someday someone with good technique will record these nocturnes. Unfortunately, GSP Records, the label on which Philip Hii appears, hasn't published the transcriptions."
3,Garfield's Thanksgiving!!,"I was disapointed that the story wasn't as good as Garfield's Christmas and Garfield's Halloween. The animation in Garfield's Thanksgiving wasn't as good as the animation in Garfield's Christmas. Jon's Grandmother was very funny. The actress who did the voice of Jon's Grandmother also did her voice in the Chrismtas Special, so I disapointed that Jon's Grandmother's voice didn't sound the same. Because she is my second favorite character in Garfield's Christmas.This is a [poor] excuse for a Garfield Holiday Special. It's not worth the high price that it is selling for. I do have it in my collection. But I didn't pay over $...for it.I don't suggest buying this video. I do however strongly suggest Garfield's Halloween Adventure and Garfield's Christmas Special."
5,It's great!! Funny and entertaining!,I liked it alot. It was very funny and I liked the songs. Odie was cute and funny. Odie looked funny with the 4 peg legs.
1,Not a good copy,"Bought an episode, the paradise one, and the sound was terrible. The background music was so loud it over powered the characters speaking a multiple points making for a unsatisfactory viewing experience."
3,"I love the cartoon, but the sound coming from the download is terrible!","If I could give the cartoon a 5, and the download quality, I would. The cartoon is touching and sweet and Garfield is just the same as I remember him from my childhood. Downloading this, though, I can hear the music really loudly and the talking is quite soft. If you love Garfield and Odie like I do, it will still be worth it."
2,Sound weirdness...,"This is a review specifically for the online video of ""Here Comes Garfield"". It's an impressive example of vintage TV animation. What's entirely unsatisfactory is the sound quality of Amazon's offering. For some reason, the dialogue is very quiet, even muffled, even at volumes where the music and sound effects get uncomfortably loud. It's hard to say what went wrong, or when: Maybe it's a problem with how the recording plays back; maybe it's an issue of how different tracks were preserved; it might even be that the original dialogue recordings were subpar. Whatever the reasons, it's a thoroughly disappointing and even unpleasant experience.David N. BrownMesa, Arizona"
3,Funny,It was neat to see Garfield save the day and not eat the day. He keept his same swagger and did the job.
2,CHECK PREVIEWS!!!,"I was excited to find this movie that reminded me of my childhood days my mom had it recorded for me as the years passed we lost the vhs. I wanted to find it so that my 3 year old could watch a cartoon I used to watch she loved it, only bad part was that the previews it had before and after were not what any parent expects it was somewhat sexual and seductive. I believe they were chinese films but either way enough to make me not want to put it on for her anymore. I hope to find a better copy in the future. for now I will have to find something more modern."
1,Does not work with Iphone :(,"The Iphone is the most popular cell phone, and the microphone does not work with this cord:(This should be clearly posted, and not doing so is deceptive. I will not order anything from AZ Geek Store in the future :("
4,Enables me to use alternative products in my call center,"As a hearing aid user, I have always found it difficult to deal with pre-installed call center systems. My current workplace uses Plantronics headsets with the Quick Disconnect feature, including a split jack for trainers. As a rep who is also a trainer, I need to be able to use Quick Disconnect to go between my station and those of other employees. I have always just made do with the headsets over top of my hearing aids, but it doesn't provide good sound.This adapter has changed my work experience completely. With this, I am able to connect hardware directly to my hearing aids while still maintaining the essential use of Quick Disconnect. I needed a female-to-female coupler to hook up my equipment, but this little part is what changed my whole life. I had no idea Plantronics even made this, I looked for a long time, then finally came across it here! I'm happier than ever."
2,"It teaches a good lesson, but...","This book teaches you to always be yourself nomatter how violent things get. It would have been wonderful if it didn't have so much killing, drinking, and sadness in it. I cried so hard after I read it! I don't usually mind crying after reading a book because I know that there was some hope for the characters' life. In this book, the characters had very little of it."
3,skype remote phone,"gud: easy to use and works well, saves moneybads: poor construction, cheap phone-bads: 2 small battery powered- gives 1-1.5 hrs talk time before dying"
4,Works Good,"This is a neat product, it was easy to set up and quite easy to use. Callers say the sound is very clear though on my end it is a bit ""tinny"" sounding.The battery life is excellent and I can walk around the house and even outside and still use it.I would recommend this to anyone except the fussiest people who would settle for nothing but the absolute best there is."
4,Money saver,"Third world country governments, especially the authoritarian ones, tries to skin their people to the bones.I bought this phone for my relative in Vietnam to use to save me money.This one works wonderfully, the voice is very clear except some heavy traffic periods; and I am very happy that it costs nothing for me to call my mom!. Be aware that you need to have a router between dsl(cable) modem and this phone."
1,Not capable with European Standard,"This unit looks great and got overall outstanding reviews. And the price was more than enticing. I was very excited to test it out using skype. I currently live in the UK but spend much time in the US. The description of the Linksys CIT400 is misleading in that it mentions that the cordless phone is compatible with European and South American channels. I thought no problem to use it in England. I brought it over, unpacked it and found that the two Power adaptors (base station and phone charger) are set at 120V input. Much of the world, and the UK, is at a 220 to 240 standard. I was sure these power adaptors would be multi-voltage, like many electronics these days, but they are not. I was very disappointed and had to return the phone. I put the one star to attract attention. Can't really comment on its functioning"
4,Excelent if you just need a cheap phone service with great looking hardware,"made better by the release of the extended handsets I love this product. Easy to use would be an understatement.my only complaints are as follows1 locks up on occasion, may have been fixed by firmware, check the website2 when you buy unlimited skypeout it will ALWAYS complain about low balance could also be fixed in firmware3 sounds echoey on my end, may need to tweak my setup, could also be skype's problem.4 makes my parents call me too often because it's cheap.... nothing can be done about that."
2,"Works great, but not for long","I took out the phone, plugged in the cable, signed in with my skype account, it worked great for few days, after which it started giving me problems:a) Suddenly the phone screen started showing status ""Unavailable"", checked everything, everything was in order. Had to reset the device by plugging out the power, internet cable and then it started working fine.b) After some usage you can't seem to hear other person's voice. Had to reset the device again and it again works fine.Contacted Linksys support, at first they were asking me strange questions about downloading skype software etc, after the third call I got through a sensible person who suggested a firmware upgrade but didn't acknowledge this being a known issue, though there are forums which are littered with user experiencing this issue.Overall, I think the phone works great when it works and would suggest others to upgrade their firmware for uninterrupted service."
4,Not perfect...,"The concept of this phone is fantastic. I love that I can use this both for Skyp calls and regular landline calls. It was easy to set up and works well. The only thing I am not happy with is the sound quality. I find it to be a bit to ""tinny"". People on the other end say the transmitted sound quality is good. As others have mentioned... I am also still waiting for the extra hand sets to go with this."
3,Won't replace your telephone,"With Skype offering $30.00 per YEAR for unlimited service in the USA and Canada, this sounded like a real winner. It is pretty nifty, but still not 100% ready for prime time. For one, it doesn't always connect after you dial. If you don't hear a ring tone, give up and try again. Maybe you just need to change the status to ""online."" Then there are the embarassing dropped calls - after several minutes of successful connection, the service just stops. It is difficult to hold the receiver between your ear and your shoulder - you'll need a headset. The speakerphone isn't the greatest either."
4,Great device,"Great little device-allows me to combine my VOIP phone and regular landline into one device. A skype client actually runs on the phone and if you get a incoming call on your skypein, both the phone and the skype program on my computer ring. This is a much better functionality than vonage. When making outgoing calls you can choose to call over the landline or skypeout or regular skype. The communication between the handset and the base uses proprietary, low power communication, allowing the battery life to run for days on a single charge rather than what one would expect if it was using wifi. Only reason to give it 4 stars is that the first unit I got had a defective scree and i had to return it. The replacement works great."
2,Item was returned,The item arrived with a faulty installation CD. The CD id not actually contain the instalation software. It also cannot be downloaded from the Linksys website. I returned the item and my money was pomptly refunded.
3,Good except for the battery,"This is a revolutionary item. I do not have to keep my computer on all the time to make or receive skype calls. So I save power and lengthen the life of my computer. If you purchase a skype out and skype in credit and you have a high speed broadband connection, you can save on long distance calls. Skype gives a unlimited calling to landlines for a fixed annual fee.You also must have a router if your modem does not support multiple ethernet ports. The only issue with this product is that the battery that is supplied gets discharged soon. It does not compare to a cell phone or a cordless battery."
4,better than Belkin,"I bought this and a belkin Skype phone, both are working, but Belkin always lost the connection with a secure (wep) wireless."
1,This device simply didn't work.,"I'm sure this device worked for some, but after hours of trying to get it to simply connect, I finally had to send it back. It comes with a small manual, and even smaller troubleshooting guide, and the 24-hour tech support is only equipped to deal with linksys routers. Even then they just give a default answer: ""we have a deal with your ISP, you should call them."""
4,Excellent purchase,"I like this product. The features are great, but it would help to have the extra phones mentioned in the ad. Also, there is a problem, perhaps not with the phone but with Skype with regards to getting SkypeIn when a phone number is purchased. Therefore one can not received calls. Still the purpose of the phone is to call out, this is a good savings."
1,Linksys CIT400 Skype,This is my 3rt CIT400... when we have storm phone break... don t buy this phone!
4,Great value! Saves on monthly phone bill!,"This phone works great. I cut my phone costs considerably. Speakerphone works great also. The handset could be a tad larger. The number of rings before voicemail picks up is set at 3. There is no way to adjust that to more rings. That's about the only thing I could find wrong with it. I recommend buying one and give it 4 stars.UPDATE 8/30/08: I sold the phone and ordered a GE 29310EE1 instead. The Linksys' handset would lock up on me and I would have to take the batteries out to get it going. Another BIG problem that bothered me, was a LOT of times the handset would NOT RING when I had an incoming landline call. It was like the phone was tuned off. If I would not have had my computer on, I would have missed a lot of calls. What good is a phone like that? Also, I read in Linksys forums that other people were having the same problem."
4,Very Good Product,"I've buy this Dual-Mode Internet Telephone cause I haven't any tel at home. As I've already had a Skype account it was easy to log it again into the Linksys CIT400. Sound is good, telephone very easy to plug & use.But there are 3 things that make me disappointed:1. We can't send sms with this telephone, I need to connect on my Mac & my Skype account if I want to do it2. We can't connect Skype website directly to add some SpypeOut credit, have to use my computer.3. When the screen is in ""screen saver"" mode, the screen still looks like on: I tried it in my bedroom & the screen reflecting into my mirror.Otherwise great product. Thx LinksysOliver"
3,It works well enough...,"Pros:1. Pretty good sound quality2. Works wellCons:1. It often hangs up after a few minute for unknown reason. We have to redial to get more of a stable connection.2. It really should have a fast dial fuction. It's bothersome to go into contact list everytime to find the number everytime. Because we call international numbers, the numbers are quite long, and i wish it would have at least 9 one-touch dial fuction."
4,Very Usable Skype Phone,For cutting edge technology this is not too bad. I use it for my main phone. Some problems I had to get past.I use Skype Out Unlimited and it always gives me a low balance warning. I have about .49 Cents as my balance. Solution is to add $10 to your balance.If you reject a second call that is coming in you will have a tone that plays every few seconds during your current call. It is best to answer the call and then go back to your original call.When I first set it up I was having problems with hearing people on the other end. I powered down the unit and powered it back up again. It has been fine from then on.Here are the good points about this phone:Easy setupGood rangeLong battery lifeComes with chargerClear color screenDoes not feel cheapGood sound qualityI would recommend this phone.
4,Good Product-Serves the Purpose,This is a good product..It took under 10 mins to connect and login in to skype..Local calls are very clear and connection stays on without any disconnect.Only negative is the keypad good have been better. It is hard to use it..Looks cheap.Otherwise it is a great product
4,Excelent product B-U-T they issue with no extra handsets...,"The product is just perfect. I am really enjoying it. However, when I wanted to expand to my room, I needed to buy another handset which cannot be found anywhere... Linksys doesn't sell them...I got really frustated and gave up of buying the same model for my business."
2,Additional handsets supported but not available,"If you are interested in a multi-handset setup. Don't be fooled by the product description or the user manual which states several times that multiple handsets are supported.They might be supported, but you won't be able to purchase any additional handsets."
4,Excellent (and finally extra handsets!),Found this phone to be great Skype-to-Skype and SkypeOut. It really extends the use of my Skyping not being tethered to my PC and not even needing the PC to be turned on.And now finally I was able to purchase an extra handset.Linksys CIT400H Dual Mode Expansion Hand set with Integrated Skype for CIT400
4,When works ... works really well,It is nice and handy unit with all very good voice quality. Although it gets off line sometimes and you need to reboot the internet and base station. After this handset needs to reboot. I have also upgraded it latest firmware because there was no sound coming or going out after initial setup. But saying this when this unit in action it works very well and there is no static and voice deterioration over time. I have taken SkypePro membership with SkypeIn ($60). No more bills on land line. At amazon you are getting additional handsets so issues with that. I am also going to purchase Phillips VOIP 841 for my parents and later post which is better !!!
5,CIT400 on Amazon Rocks!!!,It's a LinkSys. Great price under 90$ and free shippings. What do you want more? Buy it!! The CIT400 router and handset that I received have a different color and a different LinkSys logo (dark gray). Other than that no problems at all. I also purchased a 110/220V adapter because I am planning to use it from Italy this summer. If interested buy an AC adapter capable at least of 30 watts (the two ac/dc adapters require 12+14.5W). Thanks Amazon!!
4,Occasional reboot needed,"This thing just works as described. Once every couple of months I will have to unplug it and leave the power off for a few seconds to ""reboot"" it, but that is only a minor inconvenience compared to the benefits of being able to use skype away from the computer."
3,Works well but only one handset,"Easy to set up if you ignore the ""Run the wizard instructions"". Only issue is handsets. They advertise up to four handsets per base station. Can not find any seperate handsets for sale and one poster says Linksys will not sell handsets and the CIT400 will not work with more than one handset. Hopefully he is wrong becaus I need two more handsets."
3,2nd Handset,"Been using the 400 since january works great, i've read that the netgear sph150 stand alone skype phone will register to the linksys base."
2,This was junk,I was too early as an adopter. This was junk. I think I made 3 calls with it in total.
4,Good Job Linksys,I am happy that I found this product. I have been shying away from Skype because I did not want to be tethered to the computer while I make calls. This product has made calling as seamless as using a traditional wireless phone. The call quality and feel of the phone is great. I would recommend this phone with out hesitation.
5,Fantastic phone!,"I have been looking for a cordless phone to work with my Skype service and I've finally found one. The setup was soooooo easy, literally plug and play. You just need to charge the battery overnight first. Then you log into your Skype account right on the phone. You can see your Skype contacts and call them. It will ask you if you want it to be a Skype out call if the contact is not a skype user. You can also just dial a number like in Skype on the computer. I haven't tried the regular telephone feature on it yet because I really don't have the need.I have a lot of clients in the Caribbean so I wanted to get this and not be tied to the computer via a headset. Now I am free! The clients tell me the clarity is great. I am using a business class cable modem service though, not a DSL.You won't be disappointed with this phone."
3,works fine but looses connections many times,The product is fine and the delivery was short. However I am having sometimes problems with connections. I usually get the message call failed and i can't find out why. Otherwise the phone is working fine.
4,good,easy and conveniencei do not have to open my computer and i can still use itthe short part is that the batteries can only lease about 10hoursneeded to be charge quiet often
1,Defective phone,"I bought two phones, one of them drops connection to the base every few seconds, then says ""system is starting up"". Searched on the internet, turns out A LOT of people have this problem. Called Linksys support, they started assuring me it's my router / internet provider settings, etc., until I insisted that one of the phones is defective (the other works fine with the same precise set-up).Waiting for a replacement now but I'm kind of sorry I bought into this whole thing; I wasted way too much time on this. It is also kind of puzzling Linsys does not perform proper quality control on their phones (apparently this problem has been around for at least a year), and ships defective hardware. I will take notice of that for my future shopping..."
4,Good phone,"I had some problems installing the phone at the beginning. But I believe generally you can reset it like how you reset your normal wireless router. For example, reset the machine when it is on, unplug the everything, plug in the internet, and then the power. Now the quality is pretty good."
4,great phone!,"Phone worked perfect out of the box. Didn't even have to read the instructions. I have a Mac and since you are not required to have a PC, just a network, it still works like a charm. Sound quality like all skype phones is just ok but not perfect. Only complaint is that seperate handsets are not available yet. It states that you can add up to 4 with one base. Linksys has equipped there phone support group with idiots! They have no idea when they will be available!"
3,just ok,"This was well done, but if you can get your hands on the version with Denys Ganio and Zizi Jean Marie, you will be in for a real treat. Of course, Zizi was fabulous, as usual, but Denys Ganio was amazing! He was an incredible dancer and artist!"
3,"Ok, but not the best","Before I started read the book I thought that it would pretty action packed. To begin, it had the wrong title for what it was about. This is because it was more about Moose's problems then about Al Capone washing shirts. Next the plot did not seem to be well written because it was not focused on one main theme and kept change to different things. In conclusion this book is for you if you like a lot of change in the plot and the setting."
4,Read this Book,"Initially when I first read the book I first thought it was going to be about a boy who meets Al Capone who I thought was a famous celebrity. To begin, I didn't know that Al Capone was a mastermind criminal. It surprised me when I found out that the book was going to be about a boy living on a maximum security Prison island. I thought it was going to be very boring but than I got hooked and couldn't stop reading. Next, this book teaches me that everyone can change, and help can be found in ways you'll least expect. I wish that this book would have explained more details to me. I felt like the author was leaving out valuable information that needed to be said. All in all, this book would be a great Christmas, birthday, and valentine, present to give to any one of all ages."
4,"original, quality reading for young adults","When his father gets a job as a guard and his sister is accepted at a special school, Moose's family moves to Alcatraz. Feeling like one of the prisoners, Moose finds himself trapped by his duties as an brother to a mentally challenged sister, unable to do the things that other kids his age are able to do. He also has to deal with his mother, who is obsessed with curing his sister, and Piper, the Warden's cute and trouble-making daughter. I admit that I picked up this young adult book based on its clever and catchy title (which actually has a surprising significance). It is a good, decently written young adult novel dealing with difficult family situations and dynamics. It could have been better, had it been more literary (such as drawing more direct parallels between Moose's life and his setting and the disconnected plot threads). A decent, rich read for grades 8 or 9. Grade: B+"
4,Great story to share with kids headed to visit Alcatraz!,"We recently visited Alcatraz in San Francisco with our three grand kids (eleven, eight and five). Our book to read enroute to California was Al Capone Does My Shirts. It was certainly a great way to set the stage for our visit and helped to make the excursion meaningful. The additional learning piece about a sibling with autism has generated some thoughtful discussion, as well."
4,Al Capone Does My Shirts,"This book is about a boy named Moose.He just moved to Alcatraz. He's having a probelm fitting in ; his sister, Natalie is mentally challenged and goes to a special school.During his stay he meets Piper, Theresa, Jimmy' and Annie.Piper is a troublemaker who comes up with a plan. Theresa is a cheerful little girl. Jimmy is a building machine and Annie has a good arm. Soon, Moose starts to like Alcatraz as he gets into exciting adventures."
4,Good (Not Great),"Al Capone Does My Shirts by Gennifer Choldenko is a very good book. Not great but good. It definently deserves the Newbery Honor it won, but not the Newberry Medal it didn't win. The plot was very good, but if it had taken place anywhere else the book wouldn't have worked. The book is very funny, and I liked it alot. Everyone who likes books would love this one."
2,boring,"**This book is about a boy named Moose and his family who move to Alcatraz. Moose and his family try to get Natalie, Moose's sister, into a special school for autistic kids, but Natalie's too old for the school. But Moose finds a way to get her in.I think this book was pretty good but there was no action; that's why I give this book 2 stars.The most memorable part of the story for me was when Natalie got caught talking to 105 (one of the prisoners)."
5,Awsome!!!,"This book is so good!!! I really enjoyed this book. It' s about a boy who's very tall for his age. His name is Matthew Flannagan, but he would rather be called Moose. He also has a little sister named Natalie, except she's autistic. Since Natalie's autistic he has a big responsibility. He takes care of her really well. For any reader I would say if you like adventure, action and history, you will really like this book!!!!!"
1,whatever,This book wasn't very good it didn't have enough action I thought. They didn't see any prisoners run away or anything they only snuck cloths into Alctraz to get them washed. Piper was pretty cool though she got all those kids in trouble and she only got sent off the island for like 3 weeks.my Favrite character would probally be moose becuase he dosn't do anything but gets into trouble for lot of stuff. All in all you can see that this book really didn't suit me.
1,A One Page Review,"My review is, admittedly, a review of one page. I put this one down after reading just one page. Personally, I am weary of Children's Literature that resorts to potty-mouths and shock value to appeal to our present culture. On the first page - turds, rapists, and private parts? Seriously!"
1,Simplistic and Sad,"The whole book can be summed up in Moose's opening statement:""I'm not the only kid who lives here. There's my sister, Natalie, except she doesn't count.""Apparently all they have to do is get rid of Natalie and their lives will all be better.Poor Natalie.I'm the mother of a child with autism, and I hated this book. I hate how it is assigned to children to read and permeates the message of segregation of people with disabilities in society. Kids with autism do not need special schools and to be taken away from their families, kids with autism need to be accepted and loved, and made part of families."
3,A good book,Al Capone does my shirts is about a girl named Natalie who has Autism. My favorite character in this book would probably be Moose because when his family moved he left his baseball team. I know what it is like to leave something special behind. I left my friends behind but I can go see them. My most memorable part would have to be when Natalie's mom kept saying no she isn't 16. She's not 16. To her son Moose. Also I have an aunt whose daughter is just like her. I also liked the part where the con man was talking with Natalie. The man was holding her hand. Also I can remember the man by his nickname 105. Another part that I liked was the part where she was counting rocks and buttons. I gave it 3 stars because I've read better books. I didn't like this book because it didn't have enough action for me. The book doesn't have much personality. If I would have to recommend this book for someone I would recommend it for somebody about 30 or older.
4,Cutest Story,"I had to read this book for one of my Education Major classes. It is like one of my favorite books now, the story is such a good story and is enriched with so many things you can bring attention to help a child grow up."
1,beware of age appropriateness,"I read this book and although I enjoyed the book, I do not think it is appropriate for elementary kids which are the ones reading it. I ended up not allowing my 5th grader to read it. A central theme of the book is the safety of Moose's sister (who has autism) when she is alone with an inmate who is interested in her. It bothers me that schools and libraries are promoting this book to children too young to grasp the issues contained in the book."
3,AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS,I like the part when AL CAPONE mom is on the boat and they start to lean to the side.I like the story because moose and his family seemed like very nice people. I like this story because it was a fun story to read. I would like to visit Alcatraz someday and see what the cells look like.
2,A good book,"""Al Capone Does my Shirts"" is about a boy named Moose Flannagan, who just moved from Santa Monica. His father works at Alcatraz so his family had to move there. His sister Natalie has to go to a spacial school but on second day, the people from the school call the family and tell the Flannagan family to come pick her up. They said they were having problems with Natalie. When Natalie comes back to Alcatraz, Moose's mom tells Moose to let Natalie hang around Moose and his friends. The part that stood out was when Natalie had fits, or counted her buttons. Moose is a 13 year old boy. He likes to play baseball and doesn't really talk to his mom. Natalie is Moose's supposedly younger sister. She counts buttons and reads math books. Natalie turns ten every year but she is really sixteen. I recommend this book to people, who like books that are set in the older times or baseball and jails."
4,Al Capone does my Shirts,"Al Capone Does my Shirts is about a boy and his family who live on Alctraz Island, which sits in the middle of San Francisco Bay. The story takes place in the 1930's and the story gets its name from a scandle pulled off by the warden's daughter, Piper. The sister of the main charater has a mental disease which makes her very strange. Several families also live on the island and their fathers are mostly guards, cooks, doctors, or electrians.Moose and the other kids go to school on the island. They also play baseball every Monday. The kids make money by saying that Al Capone will do your laundry. Al Capone even helps Moose's sister by using a secret way of writing.I like the book because there is adventure and ideas I could use. I also liked the suspence of something that could go wrong. I didn't like that the time period was old.Overall, this was a good book and I think more people should read it."
3,a book I actually read,"I thought this book was awesome, I actually read it, the thought of living in the great depression made me like the book. it would not be fun. and piper reminded me of some of the people in my school. to conclude this it was a good book And I thinck every body should read this book becouse it showes the history of living on alcatraz"
5,"A beautiful, entertaining read!","I hardly ever take the time to write reviews on Amazon, but this book was so wonderful that I wanted to add my two cents to the amazon reviews. This is THE BEST children's book I have read in quite some time and it is one of the most touching books I've read period. I became so engrossed in the lives of these characters that I couldn't put the book down. BRAVO!"
4,A Good Book,"This book was pretty good. It's not the best i have ever read (this is coming from a 13 year-old girl). I've always loved Alcatraz and because that is the setting of this story, i got to learn a lot about it. It's kind of weird because the story is being told in the present-tense so instead of saying ""Mom said"" it's ""Mom says"". It was a hard book to put down and i finished it in two days, but i think that there could've been a little more in the ending; some things were left unresolved. But all in all, a good book for most all ages."
3,It was ok,I thought the book was just ok because moose did some of the same stuff every day but did some exciting things too. I think people should read it. I think it is a great book for people to read. Its exciting to see if natlie mooses sister gets into the ester p. marinoff school. The book is not too long and not too short.
4,Alcatraz Review,"If you like things about Alcatraz and famous criminals then this is your book! Its called Al Capone Does My Shirts by Gennifer Choldenko.This is about a boy named Moose Flanagan, who has to move to Alcatraz (1935) because he dad works there as a electrician and guard. And the story is mainly about his life on Alcatraz.I rate this book four out of five stars because it's not a book that would keep your attention all the time because some parts of the book are boring. I wouldn't say you should get this book, but if you see it you might want to check it out."
3,an ok book,"This book is about a boy named Moose and his autistic sister. His family moves to Alcatraz Island, because their father got a job as an electrician and guard so Moose's sister could go to the Esther P. Marinoff School for autism. While at the Alcatraz Island Moose meets the warden's daughter Piper who is always doing things that get people in trouble. Piper wants to meet Al Capone and runs a scam a school that almost gets Moose and his family kicked off the island. Then, when Moose's sister, Natalie, is denied entrance to the Esther P. Marinoff School what will Moose and his family do?This book was an Ok book. It's not terribly boring, but when you read it for a second time it can be boring. Personally, I would not recommend this book if you're not required to read it for school. It's an Ok book, but there are a lot of better books out there to read."
4,Good book with real characters,"I enjoyed this book. The setting was interesting, and the characters, both adults and children, felt authentic. I would have given it 5 stars, but the ""relationship"" between the inmate and the autistic girl creeped me out and was never explained, though it seemed there was something to it."
3,OK Book Quality,"Al Capone book was supposed to be new book. It did not arrive in ""new"" condition. Was not satisfied with this product."
2,al capone,"This book is about a little girl named Natalie and her family. Her brother's name is Moose. He helps her try to get into the school. Natalie has autism. She throws tantrums, plays with buttons and rocks, she counts birds and reads book indexes. They have to move to an island because his dad works there. And he has to ride a boat to school.Piper is a girl lives on the island with her dad,the warden.She is very snotty and always gets into trouble and she blames her friends for something she did.The most memoral part of the book for me is when natily throws tantrums."
3,Good idea- but the story gets washed out soon,"I read this book because it's a personal goal of mine to read all the Newberry Honor books. If it wasn't for that, I would have put this book down as soon as I got bored with it. Gennifer Choldenko has a good idea, but it's written so that the story gets really washed out quickly and drags on for 200-some pages. However, the research she did is admirable (to an extent) and the idea is intriguing- EVERYONE who saw me with this book picked it up."
1,caution with age level,"I picked this up for my 10 year old because of the Newbery Honor award. But the back cover mentioned murderers, rapists, hit men -- I thought I needed to read it through to figure out how much details on these crimes. There is a part where the main character loses his autistic sister and finds her she is sitting with a 'con.' Many questions can be brought up about why the boy is so concerned about leaving his sister alone with a man. The boys spends a while trying to figure out how much time they were alone together. There are phrases like -- Men that hadn't seen a woman in a long time, or exclamations like, ""Sweet Jesus."" Review it for your kid. My kid is NOT ready for the subject matter of this book. This book may be more appropriate for middle schoolers."
3,comment on book order received,"Al Capone does my shirts...order hardback but received paperback...Al Capone shines my shoes....received hardback copy but no title or writing on cover of book, just blank and not what was pictured when I ordered!"
1,Really Bad Version,"First off, I am a great fan of Woody Allen. I toured nationally plaing his role in Play It Again, Sam --but he is totally miscast in this version of The Sunshine Boys. There is no sparkle between him and Peter Falk. It is lifeless and disappointing. It should never have been done. As other comments attest, the movie version with Matthau and Burns is vastly superior. Sometimes ---great talents just don't work well together. That's the case here. Surely they knew it was not working when they shot it. No chemistry between them --a sad on-screen encounter with no payoff whatsoever. You'll waste your time watching it!"
3,'Sunshine' on their shoulders,"Don't watch this one if you haven't seen the original, because, though funny, Woody Allen and Peter Falk are no match for George Burns and Walther Matthau. Not that they didn't try, but they were both absurdly miscast since neither of them has done in real life the sort of comedy their characters do. And it shows: their supossedly hilarious TV sketch looks so forced, the child actor in it has to fake his laughs. They all do, actually. The entire thing feels forced and embarrassed.Besides, Falk is shown much too old and meaner than the part requires and Allen looks like a fish out of water in every routine; he's a great comedian but no vaudeville sidekick, and one just can't buy these guys were ever partners, let alone successful ones.Still, I hope they had much more fun doing this half-baked TV remake than I had watching it. Best of luck next time, both of them, for I'm really their fan!"
2,A Sorry Knock Off.,"The jokes were tired and the story line contrived for a more modern audience perhaps. AMC aired the original Sunshine Boys this Sunday and it was very funny; Mathaeu and Burns nailed the part. If you buy this movie be prepared for a disappointment if you have seen the original. The cast was good, but the story line was poor imho. I have to give kudo's to Amazon for timely delivery."
5,lights,"I shopped everywhere for this, found it here, use it with my lights, does exactly what it says, especially with my high temperature lights."
2,A disappointment after his Chris Barber days,"I was expecting great things from this CD, having seen Monty on video with his own band and with Chris Barber, but what I got was ""Monty Sunshine with occasional instrumental accompaniment"". Several of the tunes are just Monty playing clarinet with the rhythm section and many of the chestnuts he did with the whole band lacked the Chris Barber or Kenny Ball drive and creativity of arrangement. I may buy another of his CDs eventually, but I'll want some description and naming of the band members, who are not identified on this CD. Monty is a good clarinet man, but he's no Pete Fountain or Sidney Bechet, to hold down the fort all by himself."
4,The Only Disney Prince available.,"My daughter really, really needed a prince to go with her Cinderella. Eric indeed is a Disney prince but now she ""needs"" an Ariel doll. Fortunately, Eric is willing to play the field.The boots are fragile and the pants are very tight and hard to remove. Overall I'd say he is pretty goofy looking but true enough to the cartoon.No complaints frommy 3 and a half year-old."
5,Quite simply.....the best ever.,"I don't want to sound like I'm patronising your reviewer 'displacedhuman' but I found his/her concise review of Mike Leighs GROWN UPS quite superb. I watched this play in disbelief in the late 1970s when it was first televised on the BBC. When they repeated it in the early 80s I taped it on Betamax (RIP)! Then when my Betamax recorder finally expired I had the tape transferred to VHS. This is without doubt, the funniest, darkest and most touching of all Mike Leighs films. All the actors are superb, but Brenda Blethyns performance is stratospheric. AT LAST it's on DVD !! Goodness knows what anyone who isn't British will make of it, but try it, you just might like it too."
1,Looks can be deceiving,"I thought this would be the perfect gift for my budding 4 year old artist. Was I ever wrong! The nicest thing about this 'art' center is the case it comes in. The crayons and oil pastels have barely any color pigments- the oil pastels are almost entirely wax. The color pencils are not much better, and the water color tubes are hard to handle for small hands and don't yield better result than the inexpensive kids versions. The markers are okay, but they were not the selling point for me since young children need to experiment with color blending. She's going back to her REAL art supplies."
2,Love / Hate,"Much like my review of Hint Hint's ""Young Days"", I heard a single cut off this Tom Vek album and was in love enough to buy the whole record immediately. ""C-C (You Set Me on Fire)"" is an instant indie classic, which will find it's way on to playlists of mine forever. The rest of this album was sort of downhill after this great opening track unfortunately. My girlfriend and her friends disagree. What do they know about music?"
3,We have sound,"Apparently Vek made this album all by himself in a garage. Knowing that, you can't help but feel he could've gotten more out of the cut 'n paste techniques that follow from working all by yourself.Things start off great but somewhere in the fourth song I start getting a bit bored. A feeling that grows stronger as the album proceeds. His voice is appealing enough at first listen but tends too get a bit tedious after a while, 'cause there's too little variation in it. The same goes for the songs. Between songs there are enough differences but within a single song there are a few too little twists for my taste.It's a decent album allright, but nothing spectacular."
3,Not good for under the Christmas Tree!,"This toy was wonderful when I got it and wrapped it for christmas, however I don't know if it was damaged in transit or what but it has a habit of letting off the siren and fun noises while it is wrapped.Once we narrowed down which package was making the noise I moved it in case something was pressing on the button. It kept making noises and I eventually unwrapped it only to find the press button is in a place that nothing was even touching it. I have determined the toy either has a short in it or it is possessed. My recommendation is to only buy this toy if you plan on waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of ""Emergency, Emergency... call for help"" preceeded by sirens."
5,Robert's the Man,"The more you listen, the better it sounds. Think about it, one microphone, in a hotel room. Completely acoustic, unbelievable! Hearing [in most cases] either the original or very close to the original This is how the songs were meant to sound. Forget, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin etc. This is the Man! The lyrics are undeniably sophisticated. Check out Me and the devil, Come on in my kitchen and Crossroad Blues."
3,"Strong historical value, but....","Well, but its just not that good. I am a huge fan of Mississippi John Hurt, and have possibly grown to superimpose his genius onto all of the Delta blues I hear.After picking up this box set on an unusually wet day in Southern California, I drove around digging on the first couple of takes, smoking a cigarette, and watching people walk in the street with their umbrellas like domes of oily velvet. For the first fifteen minutes, I really liked the mood that the music set; the long, bluesy howls that Johnson belched out in the perfect spirit of the blues. After a time, however, I just grew dead bored of his songs. Many of these numbers sound nauseatingly simular, to the point of indistinction, and I dont see what all the hype is about his guitar playing either.I will keep the set and listen to it on unusually wet days, but for now I will stick to the warm sound of John Hurt."
1,recorded in a shoe box!!,This stuff is horrible!!! The mix is all wrong and the recording sucks!!! I cant even hear the gitar!!! Get Bodge's version instead!! Get ANY-THING by Bodge instead!!!
1,Horribly overrated,"I kept hearing about Robert Johnson, so I decided to listen to some of his music. What a dissapointment! First of all, Johnson plays way too slow and his music has no beat whatsoever. There aren't even any drums on the record. Furthermore, Johnson doesn't even play the electric guitar so there arent any cool guitar solos. His singing isn't any better, because his lyrics are unbelievably corny and you can't help but laugh at his whiny voice. For some real blues music you should listen to Led Zeppelin because at least he has good songs like Stairway to Heaven. I know Led Zeppelin is a good guitar player because I saw him play on the Song Remains the Same and he can play really fast and good. Robert Johnson's music is completely unlistenable and a can't understand how anyone could like it."
5,awsome real deal delta blues,listened to this and just loved it! It was just what I was looking for!
5,Oh Baby!,"Robert Johnson may be the finest representation of a perfect musical ensemble: *amazing* guitar talents, a soul-piercing and haunting voice, and profound lyricism. I have a hard time relating him to any modern day artist, but the best I could come up with is Bob Dylan. While their musical styles are radically different and their voices obviously bearing no similarity, Dylan and Johnson share a certain 'je ne sais pas' that makes them both very special artists.Admittedly, I was a little perplexed by the music the first time I put it in my CD player. I was in college at the time and passersby would peer in my room with puzzled looks on their face as I jammed the eerie tunes. But I found myself quickly drawn in to the dark, deep hole of Johnson's sound and vivid paintings of the early 20th century deep south.Buy - and enjoy - this CD."
4,The originals,"I love this double set of Robert Johnson's complete recorded output because it highlights the legacy we have experienced through subsequent artists. You must have ever heard 'Sweet Home Chicago', 'Walking Blues', 'Cross Road Blues' 'Rambling on my mind', 'Come on in my kitchen' 'Traveling riverside blues' 'From four until late' etc in some form of other. We owe this man so much! In addition, these tracks still stand up after some many years."
5,An Instant Favorite!,"It just blew me away the first time I heard it! His voice, his guitar playing, I've never heard anyone like him. Check out his hands and fingers in the picture. He must have guitar genes!"
3,deal with the devil,"hello, this is truely a great double album, but the only problem i find is that they put an alternate version right after the original version. what they should've done is put all the alternate versions on a second c.d. & all the others on the first c.d."
3,Mandatory listening for the true blues lover,"A word of caution: Robert Johnson was a performer of the Delta-style blues, which are an acquired taste to say the least. However, Johnson was arguably the greatest blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist of all time. There's no question that Johnson's ""Love in Vain"" is lyrically the greatest love song ever written, not to mention the most depressing. Overall, this is not an album for halfhearted blues fans, but if you really got the blues, this is a must."
4,a good start to the blues,"i must admit i dont know much about the blues and its history and artists. Ive heard of bb king,muddy waters,and robert johnson before. so i bought this cd. Johnson is known as one of the first, and sometimes the best but as with rap and rock the first isnt alway the first rap was around before the sugarhill gang and rock was around before elvis. anyway this is a decent cd 4 stars cuz theres too many repeat tracks& alternate takes it would have been better if it was one disc. To someone buying this cd like myself just know that it is not the end all be all of blues like the other ""first musicians"" of rap and rock there were people who did it better before and after them and dont get there credit."
5,You have to shake your head in astonishment,"The first time I heard Robert Johnson I briefly heard two songs on a horrible dubbed recording. To give the King of Delta Blues another shot, I bought The Complete Recordings. From the first track of ""Kind Hearted Woman Blues"" to the second recording of ""Milkcow's Calf Blues"" this collection blew me away. I don't think I've ever heard any blues, country, or rock played with as much soul and raw talent as anything by Robert Johnson. I listen to these CD's all day long. At night my wife and I dim the lights and listen with utter awe at the ingenious music that came out of this man's head over 60 years ago. I mean, Elvis had barely been born, the Beatles not yet. All rock goes back to Robert Johnson. This is amazing stuff. I can't say enough good things about it."
4,Early Days,I thought I liked leadbelly. Leadbelly ain't got nothing on this guy. Good stuff from the genesis of Blues.
3,A proper tribute..with one little glich.,"I think I can speak for a sizeable amount of blues enthusiasts when I say that this box set can get to be redundant if your CD player doesn't have a shuffle feature. I think that a better idea would have been to have done the original issue tracks on one disk and then have the alternates on another. An even better idea would have been to have made both of the CD's available both seperately and together. That is a small complaint, however. I think Robert Johnson's music is probably the most unique and well-known example of pre-war Mississppi blues. Like many others, I think that a boxed set of all 41 of his sides is a tribute that a giant like R.J. definitely desreves. Now, if they'd only listened to me the FIRST time they asked me for my opinion...."
4,"5-Star Performance, Illogical Recording Sequence","It's easy to get swept along in the hype and mythology surrounding Johnson and to accept him uncritically as the greatest (or at least the most influential) blues guitarist of all time. He was by any measure superb. And many of his 29 recordings are truly seminal works, but they are not scared texts ... and yes, the blues would have evolved with or without Johnson.These recording are testimony to his skill. This is a five-star performance by any measure when viewed from the quality of the material and no blues collection is complete without a Johnson recording. Knock one-star off for the brain-dead decision of the compiler to place the alternate takes directly after the ""master"" cuts. They should have put all of the alternate takes on one disc and the masters on the other. I pity anyone who plays these discs with the ""shuffle"" active on their CD player. It'll drive you crazy."
5,Definitely worth getting the works,"When buying a Robert Johnson CD, you might as well go the whole hog and get the works. If you've heard a couple of Johnson tracks and are unsure, I can assure you that there are no fillers on here (not even the alternate takes!) as every track the man recorded is a classic."
4,Great game if you can handle the challenge,"The newest release of F-Zero is, by far, the best. With its entry on the GameCube, the game finally gets the dynamic look and feel it always seemed to be striving for. The tirelessly detailed environments of this game are breathtaking, but do not distract from its fast pace. The controls allow for many complicated racing strategies, but are still quite easy to learn. The only downside to this game is its difficulty level, which may prove to be too frustrating for a lot of impatient players. However, the game will provide many hours of racing fun for those willing to face its challenge."
5,A game for gamers,"If you are a casual gamer who jumped on the PS2-Madden-Halo-GrandTheftAuto bandwagon recently and just happen to own a gamecube on the side, this is probably not the game for you. If you are an 8 year old who has any sort of pokemon cartridge sitting in your gameboy advance, then this is not the game for you either. This is an extremely (let me say it again- extreeemely) difficult game made for hardcore gamers from back in the day who welcome a decent challenge in the face of all the crap development that befouls the world of electronic gaming as we have come to put up with. This type of game requires a certain level of skill; simply put, the ones who have the natural skills will excel and come to love this game, while the others will practice the tracks over and over again in vain only to ultimately fail.For those of you who blew through Ikaruga, this is the new game to beat. Hardcore players only; all else need not apply."
1,Do not get this game!!!!!!,"I really dont like this game.its pretty much impossible to beat. I beat the first two missions in story mode and ive been stuck ever since. its pretty cool that you get to create your own vehicle, and the multi player is ok, but other than that i dont really like this game. now, i could be wrong maybe i just suck at racing games, but oh well."
2,wow this was dissapointing,"this game is bad seriusly. The levels are mostly all striaght, u barely turn ur frigging ship. Also the point og the game is to use boosts the whole game to pass ur opponents. WOW. Ur ship has like no health. U hit the wall 10 times and ur done. The stages with actual turning u will hit the walls multiple times. And yay there goes ur ship. when u fall off the edge, or ur ship explodes, it doesnt send u back to the track like a good game, it starts over. wow nintendo u people are idiots for doing something like that, i played it for 10 mins and hate it. ....."
3,&quot;Show Ya Moves!!!&quot;,"This game is great! It is not as good as Kirby Air Ride, though. There is no violence in this game, and come on! Show me the rotten suggestive themes!! There is none! The reason why it is rated teen is because of the toughness. F Zero is super hard and I recommend this game for teenagers. It is one of those games where you get beat up to much, the race is over. I got this game because I love Captain Falcon's moves in Super Smash Bros., and I heard this was an excellent game. I got this game for $10.40 @ BJ's . I love the action!!!"
2,Boring game....,"The single player mode gets very boring quick, its not online and there are no weapons. The background gets recycled so there are only FEW different looking courses. The 2 extra cups offer NO new background, just different tracks.The multi player mode is HORRIBLE. You can only race against other human, no other computer players are there. You can't play gran prix mode in multi player UNLIKE mario kart.Overall this game is not that good, mario kart is better."
4,Possibly the best GameCube Game Yet!,"Okay,,Now I have had GameCube for about 2 years now, and when i heard that a new F zero game was comin out,, I was exstatic! I immedaitly bought the game and was this game ever worth it!! The new cources are perfectly detailed, and also longer, giving you the chance for a comeback late in the race! The story mode allows you to see what your characters are eally like. And the graphics?? Could they possible be better, here is my review...Game Play: 9.5/10- Almost perfect, the controls are almost perfect also.Graphics: 10/10- Possible the best graphics I have ever seen.Controls: 10/10- very easy to learnDiffficulty: 9.5/10- Expert is challenging even for masters of the game, making it more fun.Replay Value: 9/10- 25+ cources each about 5 mins long will keep u comin back for more!Overall 10/10- BUY THIS GAME!!"
5,Need to buy this,Oh so great incredibly fun too its like the racing game i always imagined its pretty tough i wont lie the difficulty is pretty up there but i think that just adds to how much time you'll end up spending on this game if you don't already have this game you should definitely get it.
4,HARDEST GAME ON EARTH,I don't consider myself the best gamer on earth.. but i have some experience... this game surpases every level on hardness i've seen in my life... (save for the ninja gaiden ones)but it's great =D
4,"Not mind blowing, but well worth the price","This game is pure fun, lacking any substance or depth whatsoever.But that's ok--that's all it's meant to be! And the designers succeeded. This game is a good way to veg out after a long weekday or a good way to spend a Saturday morning. There are no puzzles to solve and although there are some tricky tracks, there are no frustratingly difficult battles.The graphics are very good, and do a great job of immersing you in the environments. Gameplay is good.Overall, 4.5 out of 5"
3,N64 version has significantly more playability,The 'cube version moves TOO FAST and the perspective is off -- doesn't help at all. In the N64 version the point of view let you anticipate the curves. This version moves way too fast and the point of view is way too close to the virtual ground. I'm glad I have a working copy of the N64 version.
3,Quite academic,"I used this book in a class and found it to be very academic. I would not recommend it for pleasure reading. It is a reliable source if you are doing research or reports, but the bulk of the content is so ""factoid"" I did not enjoy it. It also does not seem very contemporary."
2,Doesn't do anything for me,"It's hard to explain why I didn't like this CD. Much of the first movement of the Trout sounded to me just like a bunch of notes not going anywhere, not really connected much with each other. The first movement of the quintet was better, but lifeless, mechanical to my ear.I'm almost embarrassed I don't like this CD. I listened to the first movement of each piece, and that's all I could take. I'm not an expert, but I do listen to a lot of classical music, and I do like Schubert and Mozart. Many performances of classical music I find quite moving. These two didn't move me at all."
2,Prairie Guilt.....,"I'm a fan of Maggie Osborne's novels. But I found Prairie Moon to be tiresome. Mostly because I just didn't like either Della Ward (the heroine), or James Cameron (the hero.) Della was too self-pitying. Cameron also suffered from his share of overblown angst, but was also a bit cold. The whole 'quest' to find Claire (the daughter Della was forced to give up at 17) was very unsatisfying.I like Osborne best when she sticks to Americana, but also when the subject matter is a little more upbeat. This novel dwelled a bit too much on the past (the fate of Della's late husband Clarence), and the fate of her child (Claire), and not on the relationship or current situation of either of the main two characters. Because Claire and James' pasts were not that upbeat, I found it a trifle maudlin and not very romantic. My advice? Skip Prairie Moon, unless you simply MUST read an author's entire backlist."
2,DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S AUTHOR,"....and don't judge the author by this book. Maggie Osborne is one of the best writers I've ever read, but this is definitely not her best. It's pretty slow and had such potential for a great story, but she never hit her mark. Ms. Osborne just went off in too many directions and never really hit home with a story line. I gave it 2 stars because I was able to finish the book, but I really regretted the purchase. I know I won't pick it up a second time. Try her early stuff, like The Best Man, The Bride of Willow Creek and The Stranger's Wife. Her newer work just isn't cutting it for me."
2,Beware!,"I'm new to Maggie Osborne, having read (and loved!) two other novels of hers last week, but I expected ""Prairie Moon"" to get better, and it never did. After reading about 1/3 of it, I remembered my tried and true rule: give the book a good chance and if it doesn't get better, don't assume it will. I just read the end to satisfy my curiosity (Yes, I know this is forbidden by the ""rules,"" but get real! Reading is supposed to be fun and there are too many great books to wade through a dud). Bottom line: if you MUST read it, get it from the library!"
2,Dry as Dust,"This was my first Maggie Osborne book and will be my last. I liked the premise, and the first few pages drew me in but after reading further, I just don't care whether Della finds her daughter or not. The story did drag on and on. The dialogue was terrible and the hero was weak. He finds her in Texas 10 years after the Civil War and desides to take her to find her daughter who's in Atlanta, Georgia by way of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Now if I know my geography, that's WEST from Texas and Georgia is EAST! 300+ mi. west on horseback to go to Atlanta? All because 1 person MIGHT recognize her? Uh-uh. That's when I decided this book wasn't doing it for me. Romantic Times gave it 4 1/2G stars? Not in my book. I give it 2 because I liked the premise and I give her credit for drawing me in."
2,I finished it but.....,"I have enjoyed so many of her books; that's why I kept going with this one.Maggie's plots are different, which is always welcome in the field of romance. And her characters have real character, as opposed to being close to perfect. Yet, this book fails. The first half is great. The second half is so long and drawn out. Look for earlier books (like Silver Lining). Oh Maggie, I will still buy your next one, but fans beware."
2,"It's just, ugh","This book was promising, I enjoyed the premise, but it was really slow paced, the character interaction less than believable, and the ending, the ending!! i definitely had a ""you mean i spent my time reading this!!!"" I am one of those people that can't stand not finishing books, however horrible they may be, but i can definitely understand if there are people who can't finish it. If you start reading the book but get bored or annoyed, just put it down and walk away. i wish i did."
2,Doesn't Anyone Use Editors Anymore?,"This book lost me right at the beginning on page 31 when she put a roast in the oven for dinner with plans to make a pecan cake with vanilla frosting for desert. When it was time for dinner, what she pulled out of the oven (page 35) was a sheperd's pie and baked apples, with turtle soup for starters. Where she came up with a turtle for soup out there in the middle of the prairie is anybody's guess.And, as the other reviewer pointed out, the trip to Atlanta via Santa Fee kind of left me shaking my head too. I have read Maggie Osborn before. She is not usually this bad. What a shame."
5,Mirage Speaker Stands,"Just what I needed. Fit the Omni speakers perfectly, arrived quickly in perfect condition and the price was terrific."
5,A Good Toy At A Great Price!,"This hummer is good for Gi Joes and ect.. ITs nice and strong and good for all ages, tons of fun!"
2,Save your money.....,"After reading the first review, I was really expecting something special. This body wash is sooooooo not worth the money. There is absolutely nothing special about it. The fragrance is faint, it has a slightly medicinal odor, and it hasn't done anything special for my skin. It also took forever to get it. Save your money."
3,More about grace than Philemon,"The subtitle to this book (A Theology of Grace) would have been a more appropriate title for it. It is not really about Philemon. The book of Philemon is addressed in the first 35 pages or so, but that is all. He uses Philemon and his relationship with Onesimus as a springboard to discuss grace in the NT and how God's grace through Christ permeates every area of a Christian's life. If you want to read about grace, read it. If you want to study Philemon, get a good commentary."
4,Full of Fun and Charm,"I love a good romantic comedy - in movies and books. So, I was really happy to hear that Valerie Frankel had a new book out. I love her stuff... I find it really funny, charming and romantic. ""The Not So Perfect Man"" was a real treat. The story of these sisters had me rolling on the floor laughing and thrilled to my toes with my Sunday afternoon of reading.Frieda Schast is a wonderful heroine and I really enjoyed her way. I think that Ms. Frankel has come even farther in her talent and I eagerly anticipate her next offering.Cheers!"
3,NOT SO PERFECT BOOK,"This is my first time reading Valerie Frankel. I took this book to the beach with me on a recent long weekend out to Montauk, NY. This book seemed to scream Beach Book.The story is about three sisters. One sister named Irene is involved in everyone else's life, but forgets to pay attention to her own husband. She treats her husband very poorly after he gains weight. The other sister Betty has low self esteem and seems a little too involved with her brother-in-law and my favorite sister Frieda is recently widowed with a child and has met an exciting man that her sister Irene does not like.The book's ending was abrupt and confusing. There were a lot of loose ends in this book and I truly do not recommend it."
4,I loved it!,I really loved this book. I thought it was enteraining. Which isn't that what we all wish for in a book? I laughed so many times though this book. I would recommend it to anyone.
2,Eh. . .,I bought this off the clearance counter at a book store. Now I know why. I found the beginning rather confusing and had a hard time keeping track of the characters and once I started reading I couldn't wait to be done as it really was boring. And the ending I thought was awful. Too many things were drawn out and could have been shortened earlier in the book to make the ending make more sense. It was almost like she just got tired of writing or figured it was long enough so she just quickly wrapped everything up. Plus I found the editing/proofreading to be horrendous. I proofread documents for a living so I have a tendency to catch typos. I tripped over way too many of them. It's just a pet peeve of mine - I understand we're humans but books shouldn't have typos. At least not this many. Definitely won't be reading any more of her books.
5,An old favorite....,"I have both the book and the movie and while I think the book is a bit better, the movie is a gem. I have little to add to what the other reviewers have said except to point out that this was the first modern spy story. And, in its time it was an amazingly influential story. When it first appeared in the UK about 1904, it created a furor because it pointed up a major vulnerability of the British Navy's bases. It led to a complete re-evaluation of the Navy's home fleet bases and the creation of the base at Scapa Flow."
3,Not as good as the book,"This movie appears to be a labor of love for the director. There are many striking camera shots and beautiful boats to look at (almost distractingly so). The basic plot of the really excellent book on which it is based is retained, but with some unfortunate changes.As I recall in the book, there's a long lead-in during which what is going on is a mystery to our sailor heroes. In the movie there's only a brief mystery before everybody pretty much knows the Germans have a plot to do mischief and what it might be. And then they had to throw in a female lead who serves only to resolve the mystery even faster.These changes from the book water down the movie and you come away feeling like it could have been much better, much much better. But it is beautiful to look at and the acting is first rate."
3,This stuff's okay...,"That's it, just okay. Not all of the gadgets fit into the carrier, kind of a bummer. It seems to be plenty protective of the DS and has lots of game cases, but again, can only fit a select few things in. It's hard to close with the headphones and one game case. Anyway, it's cheap and gets the job done. I saw a soft nylon one that I might like better. By the way, this DS is for my 6 yr. old daughter who is not good at keeping up with small things like game cartidges and fingertip stylus'. Would be nice if it would all fit in the carrier."
2,Bad sound,"This is one of the worst recordings of Rachmaninov's piano concerto no. 2 I've ever heard. The performance may not be too bad, but the recorded sound is cloudy and it is quite difficult to hear details of quiet passages and loud climaxes. Bernstein's recording with Gary Graffman is much preferable."
2,waste of money,"wellll...first of all this book only has the step by step directions for a couple of digimon (just the 7 kids' digimon in their various forms up to champion) and the from step one to step two there are too many differences that the drawingn becomes confusing. so unless you are into tracing digimon, this is not the book for you."
3,"Good, but...","I got this book, just because I thought it would be fun. Now, don't get me wrong... it's *great* if you are learning to draw Digimon, really helpful... but I only have one problem with it: The language! Gosh, in this book, they talk like every single Digimon fan is 7 years old. If you ask me, they need some more mature Digimon stuff, for the older viewers."
3,Same Stuff as US Single,"It's a good song by Mariah, don't get me wrong.But you're probably better off getting the domestic version.I was hoping that this had David Morales' mix of ""Always Be My Baby"", but it does not."
5,Katie41388,I think that this c.d. is the one mostly played at my house. I love listening to other c.d. when I'm bored but usually the c.d. I play is Mariah Carey (Always be my Baby) everybody thinks I'm either obsated wit the song or I just follow in my cousins foot steps. Love always Katie and Marianne
5,New Poetry for a new Millennium!,"Keith Merritt has taken a vanguard step by drawing on the full spectrum of emotions in his book ""Blue Street"". In it, the poetry will astound even the most emotionally hardened reader, and prove that his is the standard by which all others must be measured up to in the 21st century!"
5,Great Book for Overall View of Optical Electronics,This is a great book that details both the theoretical and experimental details. A must for all working/studying in the field of optical electronics.
5,"You Go, Fawzia.","I can't say enough good things about this CD. As a Neil Diamond fan and with a love for his music, this CD is just another wonderful tribute to Neil Diamond's amazing music he has written over the years. Fawzia Begum has created a great mix of reggae and Caribbean sound to Neil Diamond's music and she has chosen some of his best tunes to do it with. I have listened to my CD over and over and enjoy it more each time. This CD will always remain very special to me, given to me by a special friend. Congratulations Fawzia, you are making ""Beautiful Noise."" Thank you."
