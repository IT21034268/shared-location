2,not what I expected,"I have used the Intech Beta Ti ""red"" balls in the past. Found that they were long, accurate and had a good feel. Thought this was what I was ordering. Received the ""blue"" balls instead. Distance is not good."
5,"As good as the Best,better than the Rest!","I switched from Titleist to these Intech Beta Ti balls a few months ago. I have a 18 handicap and am a senior golfer. I play around 75 rounds a year. My group of players range from 15 to 20 handicapers. They play everything from Titleist, Taylor, Top Flight etc. I find I can drive these Intech's just as far and you can not beat the value. Try a box you won't be unhappy you did.Another proud 912er in Texas.."
4,Good balls for the price...,"I've played these for one year now (18 Index), and I'm happy with theit performance. They are Pro V1's, but they're long and straight off the tee and they putt true. My only complaints are that their cover is softish (scuffing pretty easily) but they don't play soft around the green. You'll hold the green on a par 3, but don't expect the ball to back up, ESPECIALLY in desert locations."
4,Beti Ti Golf Balls,Good balls. With a 16 handicap who needs Pro V-1's. When these babies go in the water your day isn't a total loss.
3,Intech Beta Ti Golf Balls,"Great product. Great price. TERRIBLE SHIPPING TIME!!! 7 days to go from from central Kentucky to central Illinois when I ordered a computer monitor at the same time and received it in 3 days? Huh? 1 star for shipping, 5 stars for product and its price. Shame on the S & H folks."
2,"OK for the price, but you get what you pay for","These are run-of-the-mill cheapo golf balls. Some of the reviewers here think that these balls are miraculous and amazing, but they are no different than other balls in the same price range. If you're a decent player then I'm sure you can get a good score with these or any ball. However better players will get an immediate and obvious improvement by using a premium 3 or 4 piece ball. I am one of the best semi-pro golfers in the state of California, so I know what I'm talking about here.Bottom line... these are a good value if you're a complete beginner and lose a bunch of balls. If you're an intermediate to serious player then you will need to pay for something better."
3,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,I bought these balls for practise but they are actually good for competitions. The flight path and distance compare very well with other higher grade brands. They are good for the price.
5,"If you shoot over 90 for 18, these are for you!","If you are a casual hacker like myself, you will appreciate the value of these Beta Ti balls. These are not a Pro V1 and you hear a difference when putt a Pro V vs a Beta Ti ball.... but if you shoot over 90 for 18 then I'm sure your not paying for Pro V1's. I couldn't tell a difference between these vs the other balls I had in my bag (maxfli, top flight ect..) Good ball for the money, I will buy again."
2,Ball's a dud,"I normally hit Nike, Titleist, and Callaway balls. The Intech ball is 10 to 15 yards shorter. I will not use them in tournament play!"
4,Great for recreation,"I purchased these cause I started to get into golf. Lets face it, I lost plenty of balls the first holes. These were great to have for when I played with my buddies. I did not have to worry about not having enough. I dont know much about quality or what is consider a ""good gold ball"", but for recreation use, I like these."
5,AS GOOD AS THE BEST!,"Have compared these with all the big guys, Pro V's, etc. and they keep right up on distance and stopping. Hard to believe at the price. But I shoot in the low 80's and high 70's and now play these exclusively. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."
2,Why does everyone rave over the book?,Good for a quick read. This really is not the best quality of writing. The plot is very predictable. Not as good as Charly (which the movie was better than the book). Many stereotipic Mormon things and ideas. I was disappointed.
3,DO YOU LIKE DENNIS??,"I LIKE DENNIS, BUT I FOUND IT A LITTLE TO TECHNO FOR MY TASTE. THUS THE NAME TRIONISPHERE."
1,Long-term road test,"This is my second Nathan 5k Runner's Waist Pack, and for the second time, the zipper mechanism becomesso unusable that on several occasions I actually couldn't unzip it quick enough to answer my cell phone contained therein.The tab for the zipper has broken off from my aggressive efforts to open and close it, and the nylonmaterial that connects the pack to the belt is almost in tatters, ready to break any time now. Great conceptand I do like the flatness of the pack and the 2 zippered pouches, but please Nathan, use (a)a better zipperstructure and (b)better nylon material as per above. I won't buy another one."
3,Moves Around a Bit Too Much,"Pack does a good job of storing things to be sure. It has plenty of space to carry keys, phone, wallet and your friends keys too.However, the pack moves too much. If you are going to run with it, it rides up and then pulls your shirt/layer up as well.If the problem is that it is not tightened enough, then the pack would rest too high to be comfortable--between stomach and chest.It would be best if it rested on the waist and the small of one's back, but it doesn't.AS a pouch for valuables when you go snowboarding,biking, etc.. I would completely recommend this pack. But for running, I would look for something else. It has way too much space for running anyway. You don't need to carry all that much stuff."
4,They need to make the straps foolproof,"I agree with some of the other reviewers: the strap adjustment is not foolproof. Once it becomes undone,not easy to figure out how to rethread, unless you are a mountaineer or former scout. How about posting illustrated instructions on the Internet?The tension and the webbed texture hold the belt to the buckle, but when the belt is undone and is not on you, it's too easy for the belt to become undone from the belt. Should have added velcro or something.Otherwise, great size (radio, wallet, blackberry and keys all fit in there), and nice idea to have mini pocket, MADE IN USA which is increasingly rare and nice Does not bounce around. The profile is so low that it looks OK when my tee shirt covers the belt."
5,Great Product,"Small, compact, comfortable. I forget it's there when I'm exercising.It has room to hold my Samsung Galaxy S2, my keys, my debit card, my id, and cash, and even has some more room leftover."
2,Great while it lasted,"I really enjoyed using the Nathan's 5k Running until it the plastic snap fell off. The problem I had with this belt was that there was no stopper for the plastic pieces. They just easily slid off as they do on. So, one day after my run, I took my pack off and did not notice that one of the pieces had fell out. The next time I went running, I couldn't find the piece anywhere.For an item that costs this much, (I paid the full $24.99 since I purchased it at a sports store it only lasted me a little over a month) I will not be re-purchasing this item. I am now looking again to a small belt that will fit my ipod in it."
5,Like Pepsi-Cola,"Just Like Pepsi-Cola... Living Things are The Choice of a New Generation as Well as The Voice... So Pick This UP NOW!!! What are You Waiting For... Seriously, Stop Reading This and Pick It UP at Your Local Record Store... and Remember Who Told You about Them Before They Blew UP... If You Like Bands Like The Clash, X or Bad Religion Then You Simply Must Own This!!!"
5,Amy#7 is great! It mixes science fiction with adolesence!,"Amy #7 is about a girl who knows nothing about her past,and no one will tell her anything about it. As she reaches adolesence she notices that she can hear and see better, not to mention that she gets the best grades in everything that she used to be horrible at! Her friends joke that she is becoming perfect, but when Amy's mom says she is, Amy has a feeling her mother's not being sarcastic,... or saying it out of love. I hope you enjoy the book!"
5,"The perfect race, Fantasy or Reality?","12 year old Amy Candler isn't normal. She can answer any question her teachers ask before anyone else. She can do gymnastics like a top gymnast. She can see and hear for great distances. She keeps having a recurring dream. Someone is following her, taking pictures of her. Her freind says it's because she's growing up. But what Amy discovers is far beyond what she expected."
5,Amy Number Seven,"The book Amy Number Seven is a very good book.It is about a twelve-year-old girl who is a clone . She has perfect powers,and she is good in gymnastics,ice skating,running,and basketball without praticing. And someone is leaving notes in her mailbox.And anyway I would give this book 5 stars. you should read this book."
4,Boring at first but then...,"Okay, Amy Chandler is the perfect twelve year old girl. She's five feet tall, with brown hair and brown eyes. But things start to get wierd when she starts knowing the answer to every question her teacher asks, hearing and seeing things from a long way a way, doing perfect gymnastics, and being able to professional ice-skate without any lessons. I won't tell you why Amy is like this, you'll have to read it to find out.P.S. This book is kinda boring at first, but don't put it down because it gets a lot better!"
5,"Chillingly suspensful, great reads all around!","Chillingly suspenseful, great reads all around! The facinating story of Amy ""no.7"" Candler is a definite page turner. I definitly recommend it!"
1,LifeGear Travel Lite Massage Table,"Disliked table. Each time table was set-up, legs had to be attached by the support rods. This was not an easy process nor done quickly. The face hole in table was not useful to me and was very uncomfortable. 1 Star for this item is too much for my usage and review. I sent it back."
4,Good massage table if it fits your needs.,"I found this to be a good table for my personal needs at a fabulous price. I shopped all over the web and this is definitely the best deal. It's lightweight because it's a little short and skinny. I prefer it short and skinny so I can store it easily in a small room. Check the measurements to make sure it's long enough for what you want. I like extra-extra smooshy padding, so I added a cheap foam pad from Walmart over the table and put a twin size sheet over that, but you wouldn't have to do that if you like a regular massage table feel. I don't use it as a portable table, so I'm not sure how convenient it would be to take down and up. It is probably better as a personal massage table, not as a ""professional"" table. I have a larger table in my office where I work. Hope this helps!"
3,good quality for the money,This massage table is quite adequate and a real bargain. My only regret is that the head hole makes creases on the face. I wish I'd waited and bought another for the same price on Amazon with a padded head cradle which would also have added length to the table. There's no way to attach one to this table. Live and learn.
4,Good Quality,"Very supportive, and very affordable. $119. That's all I paid for it. Just not fit for tall and wide patients..."
4,Works for me!!,"This table works just great for me. I do Healing Touch, and the people that have used this table say it is very comfortable."
3,Great Game-Too Many Errors,"I have been playing Scrabble on my handheld Treo for a couple of years at the expert level -- problem is that the ""maven"" who wrote the program included too many non words and it ""cheats"" -- e.g., TLED, INQUIET, KOREAN,GUTTYl,THENS, INTERJ, DLING refused to accept POSTCARDS as a pluralized word and ""MAVEN"" is defined as Brian, the intelligence for this version. ALso, there is no way to challenge the computer, but the computer can challenge your words.I love playing this game and have whiled away many hours on planes, etc., in waiting rooms, etc., but I wish they would correct these errors -- then it would be a five star product!"
4,Cute!!,"My daughter loved this doll! She loves Cheetah Girls and they aren't as easy to find as they used to be so I was glad to find this one. It comes with a cute mini poster and a backstage necklace. It's a pretty and durable doll. My only complaint is that even after I switched the doll from ""demo"" to ""on"" she doesn't sing much of the song and sometimes she stutters like the song is skipping. I haven't changed the batteries yet since we opened it so I am hoping that will fix this problem because my daughter loves it and it's a cute toy."
5,Stomping great CD!,"This whole CD is fantastic! Each song blends into the next brilliantly and it's so easy to just keep playing again and again.There's not really a weak song on the whole CD but if I have a complaint it's that the track, 'Where Do You Go' by No Mercy is a bit too long for my liking, other than that I'd highly recommend it to anyone that loves a good dance and party."
5,Great CD,"At first I thought the movie would be awful, but I saw it and loved it. The music in it was great (old stuff, but still great). So I bought the CD and was not at all dissappointed even though I generally dislike dance music."
3,About night at the roxbury,"A great old and new dance mix of music , very exciting and puts you in a party atmosphere yet they missed : "" everybody hurts "" which was in the movie , that was my disappointment."
3,Great Dance Music but the songs are a little old,"I would have given this CD 5 stars if it had more up to date dance trax. Otherwise its a great CD. Gives you a lot of good dance music without having to go out and by the whole album of each artist, which usually only has 2 or 3 good songs and the rest aren't worth listening to. I was a little dissappointed that some songs from the movie didn't make it to the CD and some songs are different versions than that from the flick. I still reccomend this great movie/dance CD."
4,"If you enjoyed the move, you must get the CD!","After I saw A Night At The Roxbury, I knew I had to get the soundtrack.With many soundtracks, you will get most of the music of the same genre, and then one or two wacky songs that dont fit in at all. This is not the case with the Roxbury soundtrack.This music is right out of the 80's head bobbing dance scene."
5,Song from movie not included!,"I loved the movie and make it a point of showing it to all my friends. The Cd is fantastic, although it doesn't have that really cool sounding song that is playing while the Butabi's are gridlocked in traffic on the freeway I think. Does anyone know what the name of the song is or the artist? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
5,GREAT DANCE SOUNDTRACK!!!,"Not only is ""A Night At the Roxbury"" one of my favorite movies, the soundrack is AWESOME!!! I love every song, and it totally pumps me up for a night out on the town. Lotta fun!!!"
4,The most fun music out there!,If you watched the movie you will even appreciate the music more. Its a blast.
1,Sucks big-time!,"The first track, ""What is Love"", which plays as background for all the advertising promos for the movie, SUCKS BIG TIME !!! It sounds nothing like the ad promo, nor even remotely like the renditions given on Saturday Night Live when they do the Roxbury Guys skits.Did they hire the Lawrence Welk orchestra for this? Did they put silencers on the drummer's sticks? What???By the way, the one-star rating I gave is because they didn't have a 'no-star' rating !"
5,Great buy,"I ordered this item and received it faster then expected and although it was used, it was like new.."
5,Excellent movie!!!,"The songs from this SNL-based movie soundtrack are absolutely excellent!!! I also recommend to see the movie...hilarious!!! SCORE!!!...""What is love""..."
5,lots of reasons to own this CD..,"This CD makes me dance when I'm not in a great mood, keeps me cleaning when I run out of steam. I love the movie, and always thought the music was great, so I bought the CD also. This CD has quick beats, with great singing. You know how you can buy a CD and sometimes there are only a few songs you like, well with this one you will love them all."
4,Excellent Inversion Table,"As many reviews have suggested, this is a great product. It has helped my husband and myself with our back and neck pain. It is so relaxing to hang and get stretched out. It took my husband about 45 minutes to assemble (he says it wasn't very difficult). The only draw back is its size and weight. It is truely meant to be assembled and left alone. As far as the weight capacity, my husband weighs about 260+ pounds, and it works fine for him...very sturdy. As far as its size, it takes up an area of 74 inches long (when set up for someone 6'1"", just add 1"" to your height and that is how long it will be) by 28 1/2 inches wide. This is a lot of space for a small room. It was definately worth the money though."
4,Pleased with purchase,"The table was easy to assemble. The video was helpful. When I first started to use it, I stayed inverted three minutes at a time, then progressed to five minutes. I would stay longer except that my ankles begin to get sore. I would like to find a better way of staying inverted, or better padding around the ankles. Overall I am very happy with my purchase.-----Joel Ponzio"
2,Lifegear Inversion Table,"I like the table and the way it makes my back feel. Disadvantages are the clamps at your feet, hurt your ankles. It needs some type of secondary straps or something to relieve the pain at the ankles, doesn't lock very well and hold you in. This table is huge and takes up alot of room."
5,"Excellent for the hair, spine, and ankles","Table was put together in less than an hour. It's comfortable and safe. Once I get off the table, my back feels more flexible and my ankles have more range of motion. The ankle decompression is an added benefit for me. The ankle holders grip my ankles securely and with the comfort of the padding. I can go barefoot or with shoes. Either way feels fine. Another added benefit is that the blood goes to my head (not in any rush) and circulates so my hair is actually thicker."
1,Reviews regarding eyes most helpful,I was shopping for an inversion table when I saw the comments by physicians that it might be damaging to the eyes; this probably saved me from creating potential problems. Wise move to check this with eye professionals before using. Thanks to everyone. I regret the one star rating but had to seclect a star before I could post a review. It probably deserves a lot more stars for those who can use it safely.
4,LifeGear Inversion Table,My husband had a bad disk in his back and is bothered off and on with pain. The inversion table has helped reduce some of the pressure and relieve some of the pain
2,Wasn't that much effective with me.,"Feels good when doing it but my back still hurts.There were broken plastic pieces inside. I requested replacement for that piece but no answer yet.Another thiing is if you want the full inversion, this product doensn't work. I don't know but I followed all the instruction but it just doesn't stay still in full inversion position."
5,Bargain,"Quality seems high on product and for the price a good deal. Unless I tried all inversion tables I wouldn't know for sure which was best for buck, but this was one of the lowest priced tables and I feel more than happy with it. How high-tech does hanging upside down need to be?"
5,A Great Purchase!,"I think this was a really good buy. Much less expensive than some over priced TV brand. I almost made that mistake. This is a quality machine at half the cost of the other. I really like it! Like other reviewers say, the ankle supports could use a little more padding. But I am a 260lb male and I can live with it. It really isn't that big of a problem. Payment was easy and painless, and the shipping was very fast. About 2 days. I would do it again in a skinny minute!"
4,INVERSION TABLE,The table is great. But the ankle support is very uncomfortable. I wear workboots to help with the problem.
5,GREAT VALUE,The table was very easy to assemble and it comes apart quickly to fold flat for storage. It's easy to use and has really helped to relieve some of my husband's lower back pain. I looked around a lot and compared other tables before buying this one. This table works great and I'm glad I didn't waste the money on a more expensive one.
3,Heavywieghts,The table is very heavy duty and functions as described. My only problem with it is the pressure it puts on my feet is painful when I use it . It does however help my back pain. So the trade off is worth it when my pain is bad. I will mention I am over the normal amount of weight and the extra weight hanging on my feet alone is probably the reason for the extra pain. hope this review may help.
3,Okay Product For the Price,"Easy to moderate assembly effort. Tools are sent with it, but screw driver will damage some screws. Some poor machining / alignment resulting in stripped screws. If your back is not really flexible, the adjustment set nob for the ankle lock is impossible to reach and it takes another person (or a made up tool) to set. Besides the above, it works as advertised and is sturdy. Shipping was quick. For the price, worth it."
4,Life Gear Inversoin Table,"Like it, love it and hate it.... I have had some of the best work outs on this table and then again, some of the worst... Be careful if you have ankle, knee or hip problems, this will not help you, but it does help your back and doing inverted sit ups, it certainly will give you one heck of a good work out."
2,Works Great But Falls Apart,Well I bought this one on Ebay brand new not too long ago. The rubber on the handle bars started cracking and one eventually slit so I had to to use black baseball tape to tape both rubbers pieces on the handles to prevent more cracking. Then one of the U shaped rubber pieces on the bottom where the back of your ankle sits broke in half. I keep this machine indoors I dont know why its falling apart like it is.
2,Gravity inversion table,"This table functions well, however it is hard on the ankles/feet. I would not recommend it to anyone who had high blood pressure as it tends to push all of the blood and fluids in your body down towards your head increasing one's risk of stroke. I would not buy it again if I had to do it over but because I have a had a bad back for some time I had to give it a try."
5,Why pay more?,"If you ever feel like the weight of the world is wearing you down and compressing your spine, this inversion table will straighten you out! I think it is very relaxing to allow gravity to stretch my body. I can feel the soft tissues stretching and opening the spaces between the vertebrae and my internal organs also enjoy being slightly rearranged.I looked at a lot of inversion tables and wondered why I would want to pay more. This table has everything necessary for an excellent experience. As usual, I received it quickly and set up wasn't difficult."
4,Working beautifully!,My husband needed this for his back problems. Before we got this table he could not touch his toes - within 1 week he was easily touching his toes! His back pain has improved considerably and he feels NO pain now. It's really amazing actually. He's in his late twenties and trying to avoid back surgery - this may have done the trick...only time will tell.The only complaint we have about it is that the ankle cuffs could be more comfortable but you get used to it and wearing socks helps. Also it would be fantastic if it could fold up and store under the bed...but it doesn't fit with the design now.
4,Give it a try,"I have had my inversion table for over a month. It arrived quickly and assembled easily. It's sturdy and holds my weight of 230 lbs. comfortable to use & helps to strentch my back & relieve my lower back & sciatica pain. the ankle braces don't bother me, but you can always wear socks or shoes if they bother you. no need to spend more money on expensive model if all you want is a back stretch. I recommend it."
5,Relief,I've been dealing with back problems (herniated & bulging) disks for years. I've only been using the inversion table a few times a week but I'm finding that a few minutes at a time really gives me relief. This particular model is very sturdy. I highly recommend it.
5,Excellent inversion bench!,"This bench is everything it's advertised to be. Fairly simple to assemble and very sturdy and well built. Very easy to tip back by changing your center of gravity. You just raise your hands over your head and it slowly rolls you over, couldn't be easier. I'm very happy with this purchase."
4,Good product for the money,"Overall, I'm quite pleased with this inversion table, especially at the price. It provides a nice stretch, is solidly built (and yet is lighter than some of the older tables that I've used), and it has some nice safety features. My only complaints would be that: 1) the ankle grips could be more comfortable,(granted, wearing shoes and socks does help), and 2) while the table does fold, and the foot brace detaches fairly easily, I would not call the unit ""compact"". That said, using this item at least every other day has let me skip a chiropractor visit, so it's already paid for itself."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"It isn't fancy but is comfortable and works like it is supposed to. Only drawback is the size, and a little discomfort on the feet when inverted. My kids love it and we use it daily. For the price you can't go wrong."
2,Harmful to my health,"I am prone to migraines. I used the inversion table maybe twice a week for a month for 5 minutes or less each time. I had numbness down one arm and numbness in my face for a couple of weeks before losing partial motor function in the left side of my face. I had an MRI done to rule out stroke; my neurologist feels certain it was the increased intracranial pressure from being upside down on the inversion table that caused vasospasms of the blood vessels in my head. I am 36 years old. If you get one; don't ""flip"" all at once, do it gradually. It was a well built inversion table. I just won't ever use any of them again."
5,Life saver!,"We bought this five years ago and it is in great shape! My husband uses it at least twice daily and takes it on his golf outings with him. This table folds ""flat"" for travel (if you have a long enough area for it). It is sturdy!"
5,Great Speakers,I bought these for my wifes tahoe to change out the blown out stock speakers. These are great. They sound amazing with little power to them...
3,Great speakers for the money!,"I put these in the wife's 2010 Jeep JK. The mounting holes didn't fit the OE mounts, so I had to canabilize the stock speakers to make everything work. Other than that, the tweeters fit perfectly in the OE mounts."
3,waste!,"So I recently got bigger subs for my car and my cheap $40 6 1/2 inch pioneer speakers weren't loud enough so i figured these would make it louder...very little difference. I have them running off a 800 watt American Legacy four channel amp And they sound no different than the cheap speakers.Pioneer TS-G671M 6 1/2"" 4-Way Speakers (PAIR)GET EM!"
5,slamming collection T-Neck Era!!!!,"always been a Huge Isley Brothers fan. from the 3+3 era to the MR. Biggs era give me all the Isleys music because they always kept a jam. the balance of the Funk and the slow jams was there staple. back in the day when one side of the record or the tape split up and you got that balance. the T-Neck era is really when the Isleys ran wild. Ernie with his signature Guitar sounds. ROnald Mr.Biggs Isley bringing it down with his soulful vocals, Chris Jasper on the Bamboard bringing the grooves. so many classics and memorys over this compilation.i was grooving to this set today as a matter of fact. must have. tight songwriting, Production, arranging, instrumentation and vocals."
4,Real Handbook for Wind Energy,A deep look into the wind energy and wind conversion. Very extensive and deep into details considering the wind power technical aspects. I strongly advise for those in the technical wind energy area dealing with it.
3,Don't be tempted,"I love Haza's voice, so it surprised me when this CD disappointed me. I think of it as ""cotton candy"" music--it's nice and sweet, but there's no substance.The problem here is that the material isn't good enough to support Haza's ability. Some of her songs, such as ""Take Me to Paradise"", off Shaday, reach inside me and grab on. Nothing on Temptations even comes close to that. Maybe Haza had contractual obligations....If you must have this CD, try to get a used one for a reduced price."
3,"Great Watch for the Money, but Mine Quit Working","I have purchased several Freestyle watches over the years for my hubby who has his hands in or near water working at a garden center all day (we also snorkel once in a while). He really likes the comfortable rubber watch bands and the style. They live up to their reputation for working underwater as well. This one is more stylish than most and was a great price. I would have given more stars, but ours quick working within the first few months. It was after the return limit, so we sent it back to Freestyle in hopes of a repair or replacement. Can't wait to get it back."
3,Not deep enough,"This is a VERY attractive piece to add to your wet-shaving kit, albeit impractical for the tall cylindrical col. conk soaps Ive grown to love, at first. If you can tolerate waiting until your soap cylinders decrease in volume, or manually cut down your soaps, this dish is A-OK.Otherwise, spend a little more money on something else that simplifies the process."
5,Classy way to keep your shaving soap,"I just needed a cheap and easy way to store my shaving soap, without the purchase of a shaving mug. This bowl looks nice on the counter, and keeps the suds nice and dry. If you purchase the Colonel Conk shaving soap (I recommend it!), the soap cake doesn't quite fit this bowl. You need to use it a few times and let the soap wear down a bit."
3,melting the soap,"I followed Jason Bradshaw's method, which I applaud; sometimes it is surprisingly difficult to think outside of the box!Here is what I did, which is a slight modification:I chopped mine up and used a ""double boiler"" method on the stove top. Like melting chocolate for baking, you want the temperature to be just hot enough for it to melt. The less heat you use, the lower the risk of ""cooking"" the soap and changing the soap's chemical structure and damaging it. It also makes it easier to pour into the bowl because you haven't cooked off any of the moisture.The finish on the lip of my bowl is starting to chip because it's not a real wood stain. I probably wouldn't buy this product again. I would look for something that was the right shape, first of all. It is also lousy for traveling because it is bulky and there is no way to secure the lid to the bowl. Looks classy on the bathroom sink, though."
2,good for pocket change,"ya know... a package deal that comes with shaving soap.. you would THINK they would size the bowl to fit the soap they are packaging it with??? NO... I went out and bought a puter dish at an antique store for 3.00 that actually fits the soap. Use your favorite coffee mug. ALL THE things that I bought from this package deal, short of the strop have been throw aways."
1,Horribly overpriced,"This is a wood bowl just large enough to hold a cake of shaving soap. I was charged about $15 and more than $5 for shipping. I would have been better off with a cereal bowl from the kitchen. It doesn't warm with hot water, because wood is an insulating material that doesn't transfer heat. Wouldn't buy it again."
1,Beware...,Seller charged more for shipping than the item costs and we're in the same state about 45 miles apart. My fault for not paying closer attention I guess.
4,Almost perfect!,"I purchased this item especially for use with Colonel Conks shaving soap, as it was rated highly and matched by Amazon. When I recieved the bowl, the packaging wasn't spectacular looking, so if this is a gift to someone, do not send it directly to them.This bowl is very finely crafted and wonderfully polished. It's made from solid wood and is very smooth and well made. It did smell strongly of varnish when I first opened the packaging, but that went away in a couple of days.My two complaints are: It's not deep enough for a new bar of Conk's soap. It's about 1/4"" shy of being deep enough. Second, the lid, while I wouldn't say it's improperly made by any means, is looser than I would prefer. A snug lid would make this perfect for traveling.Overall, an extraordinary value, and I would buy it again."
3,soap dish,The product so far does what it lists. The soap I bought was a bit tall for the lid to close at firstbut that can be fixed by trimming the soap or waiting for the wear of the soap to allow it to close
5,Looks Better in Person,"I was surprised by how nice this actually looks, and as far as I can tell, it performs its functions admirably. Note that not all soap pucks will fit it initially, but you can always solve that with a cheese grater."
5,"It's a bowl, for soap","As far as function is concerned, this product is great. The bottom is flat with vertical sides. It is about 50% larger than it needs to be. This causes the soap puck to slide around a bit until it eventually adheres to the bowl.As far as form is concerned, this product is beautiful. The color of the wood and stain is wonderful. The exterior sides are contoured to make it look nice. It makes me wish that I had more counter space so it was out and visible instead of hidden on a shelf in the corner."
2,LaurenT,"While an educational read for the early linguist, I found this book extremely elementary and wish it had contained more details. I was disappointed, but I must have had elevated expectations. The book was written in ""novel style"" chapters, without subject headings, etc, which would have been extremely helpful for review."
5,First rate,"Thsi is an absolutely first rate university level textbook on language acquisition. Anyone even casually interested in this field would do well to read it. The writer writes authoratively and concisely in an interetsing way. Highly recommended, and on some universities set text list."
5,Please manufacture again!,"Because I haven't been able to find the soft packs, I just bought the smallest box of Kleenex I could find and it doesn't fit in the door pocket of my car. The soft packs are so convenient and I'm down to about 2 tissues in my last pack. I hope Kleenex will begin selling them again before my next 2 sneezes!"
5,Bring them back PLEASE!,"There is nothing else on the market that compares. They are nice size, not like those little tiny travel packs or whatever you call them. The are soft pack and will fit anywhere you care to place them - much better than a box. I have 2 packs left after all these years - I bought 50 of them one time when a store was closing and any more I found here and there in the last few years."
5,Excellent,"Lots of power and sound quality. The only problem I find is that it heats up quickly, but you get a cooler and go."
5,Works great,"i received my item in a decent amount of time and hooked it up the same night, and it works fantastic. i have to buy bigger speakers cause this thing is so powerful but hey, thats what happens when you have 1800 watts."
1,Crappy Amplifier,"Pyle PLA2210 1800W 2-Channel and 4-Channel Chopper AmplifiersThis amp sucks sooo much. After being install, I had less than 15minutes playing time, the amp blew up....smoked. smelt like burnt peanuts! Its no good. Dont buy it!"
2,I'd look elsewhere if I were you...,"A few things about this Amplifier. I knew when I purchased the item that it wouldn't last forever. Look at the cost, and the reviews on the item, and you'll see why. I bought this item in May of 2010. It lasted just over 7 months before it fried. Literally, fried. I didn't abuse the amp, I didn't run it at max power, in fact, I ran it at about 35% power. The power rating is way overshot, and I would suggest that if you do buy this amp, make sure that there is some vent room under it. Also put in some high quality buss fuses in it. Good luck to you if you bought this amp already."
1,this guys are thiefs,I ordered this amp and i never got it. i emailed this guys because ups supposed to deliver to my home and they lost the amp. i emailed them and they just ignored me i wanted for them to file a claim with ups for the lost package they just ignored my problem.
1,blown amp,this amp was installed by a pro shop when i first put it in it rocked so hard and clean i was amazed and so was the shop that said it was not going to run my two kicker 10's.. it was only two weeks and it blew i was running a 4 ohm load in mono and it blew out one of the 30 amp fuses and would blow out the fuse as soon as you put new one back in amp shop said it blew power supply but was not sure?? i returned it to amazon and they gave me refund about $13 dollers less than i payed.. if you can keep it running it was good clean sounding amp..just dident work out for me im now running kenwood 7204 and it is doing what it is saposed to do.. hope this helpsPyle PLA2210 1800W 2-Channel Chopper Amplifiers
3,OHM RATINGS,"the amp gets hot due to the resistance put to it, its probably 4 ohm stable bridged, which means you can run two dvc 4 ohm subs in series to four ohms. and this amp is 1800 watt max (MAX) not rms, an 1800 watt rms amp is insane. you must understand resistance in order to talk about the heat. if you need help with wiring please ask me. [...]"
2,Not Real rms watts,"When I buy it I thought 1800 watts it must explode my ears with the proper equipment of course, but when I connect it, I felt dissapointed with the performance, so I do not recommend this product"
1,A TERRIBLE AMP,"This amp is the worst amp that i have ever owned, first off if i try to bridge the amp it goes into protect mode, the fuses blew almost in the first week and i had to replace those and it cant power more than one of my subs, i have two kenwood excelon 400w rms a piece and it can barely power one of em, if i plug in both it shuts off right away. the amp gets way too hot way too quickly, the only plus with this amp is that it looks good, other than that it is horrible. never would buy a pyle amp again. the power that is says is very strethed it might push 150w rms per channel."
5,The Boys still got it.,"This is the Pet Shop Boys on their Fundamental Tour in 2006 in Mexico. I saw them a couple months earlier in Minneapolis and it was the best concert I've ever been too. And I've seen Madonna in 2006 and 2004. Great songs, great performers, and I'm telling you - you should buy this if you are a fan of PSB.."
4,PSB: Cubism in Concert,"As usual the Pet Shop Boys do not disappoint. Visuals are spectacular. All the action renders this concert very viewable. Of course, the music drives the video. If you've followed the boys over the years, you'll want to have this in your collection."
1,Karaoke in Concert,"I've always liked the PSB's music, and after seeing some spectacular videos from bands that started up about the same time, such as OMD, The Cure, NIN, and others, I thought I'd try this Pet Shop Boys release.Neil Tennant does a great job delivering the Karaoke against the tracks that Chris calls up on his CD player disguised as a keyboard. Neil's voice sounds great, and when he's in close-up, I forget for a minute what an abyssmally crappy DVD this is.When I see the full stage, I'm treated to what I can only call a half-assed middle-school version of Cirque de Soleil, with two somewhat amateurish hacks performing cutesy little tricks and other mild contortions. Most of the time the lone backup singer is lounging on a couch watching this lame-assed stage show, looking bored out of her skull, as I was during my viewing of this lemon.For me, the only use for this DVD is as a coaster.Enjoy your PSB CDs and save your money by avoiding this thoroughly unentertaining offering."
3,not as good as.....,"I was dissapointed. To be to the point it just is not as good as Pet Shop Boys ""Somewhere"" dvd.If you like PSB and good music get somewhere not Cubism.I was really hoping it would be great but it is not."
4,DJ JIMMYP APPROVES,"ALTHOUGH THIS CONCERT DVD IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ""NIGHTLIFE"" DVD IN QUALITY, IT HAS A FAIRLY NEW AMOUNT OF MUSIC TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION. A MUST FOR PSB FANS."
5,I loved!,It was the best purchase ever! They are great in thie concert! All good old and new songs!!
4,"Pet Shop Boys, a classic","I was never a fan, but I re-discovered the group, five years ago with a selection of all their videos on DVD.About the Cubism DVD, I enjoyed it very much. The quality of the audio and video is a plus.After that, I bought two CDs ( Actually and Behavior). Very good!. To be a complete fun of the band is a question of time.juanjose, Montevideo-Uruguay"
2,Best Of A Weak Bunch,"Not a great book by any means, scattershot at best. However, it does seem to be the best of a weak crop of Crystal Reports ""power user"" training books. 10 lessons and a forgettable appendix. Lessons themselves are all over the place (i.e ""now apply formatting so that it looks like the example 5 pages previous"", ""refer to bullet points in previous section"").The definitive ""power user's workshop"" remains to be written.Vastly overpriced at 55 dollars."
3,In my opinion,Easy to understand but was not as detailed as needed. Power user; don't think so. Routine logic.
3,Best but needs editing,"Not bad content-wise, but I hope the 9 version has better editing. Random hopping drives ya bunky. (Was that 3 pages back, or last chapter?)"
1,Try to follow this...... are you joking?,"I think Fast Planet could have done a lot better if they would have taken more time. The book jumps around too much. Also, if you are trying to teach someone else, it makes it awefully hard."
1,Not worth the money.,"A very cheaply made bike. Fenders and training wheels are thin plastic. Stick on decals, bag and water bottles all look very cheap up close. Several nuts and bolts missing. Fenders rub on the wheels dispite adjustment. Very overpriced and frankly shocked that Kawasaki would put their name on this bike."
4,Cute sturdy bike!,"We love the look of this bike. We took it in to a bike shop to have it assembled but the training wheels still don't seem to be level but the bike is sturdy and hasn't resulted in any falls. It was purchased for my daughter's third birthday but because she's 44 inches tall now, the bike shops recommend a larger bike and she looks a little big for it now. Great bike for smaller kids. Good value and refreshing to see a bike for girls that isn't PINK!"
3,Was a lot of work...,"This bike looked amazing in the amazon picture, but in real life the manufacturer does a pretty poor job with the little extras that make it look cool. The little mud fenders are horrible.They make so much noise rubbing, that you need to take them off all together. Also, the parts on the bike had dings that we had to paint, so that it wouldn't rust in those spots. The actual process of putting the bike together is fairly long, and tedious. My daughter loves to ride this bike, but I would have bought a different model had I known the headache putting it together was going to cause."
3,Nothing wrong with the bike but i give the instructions an F,"I have put a lot of toys and furniture together over the years and I have to say the instructions on this were the worst. They are generic instructions that are not even relevant to this bike. I had to go on line to look at the pictures on the Amazon website to figure out how to put it together. Needless to say something that should have only took an hour took way longer. Very irritating!My daughter loves the bike and rides it all the time so there is nothing wrong there. Honestly, if the instructions were better I would have given it 5 stars."
1,Pedal keeps falling off!,"We purchased this as a xmas gift for our almost 4 year old. The bike seemed well built and the right size, but the pedal kept unscrewing and falling off as she pedaled! We had to stop to screw it back on about every 10 feet. Also, on the box there's a warning that the product contains lead and lead dust may fall from it. I know kids don't typically put bikes in their mouths or anything, but if I could avoid lead on my kids products, I would. We returned this bike and purchased another one, one that does not have a lead warning."
2,Kawasaki Junk,Can not assemble Kawasaki KX 12 bicycle for my granddaughter's birthday tomorrow . The front forks are not wide enough to fit on the axle .From others I note this problem is not isolated to us . Service dept is not open on Saturday. Wonderful !! Why is Amozaon still selling this junk ? Going out to buy another brand . Strongly recommend not buying this bicycle !!
2,damaged in shipping/missing parts,"I received this bike today, and received a very damaged box. Some of the plastic parts of the bike were broken, and some parts where missing. There were multiple holes in the box. The bike is a great color - I ordered a replacement so hopefully the next one arrives and is in good condition - this is one of the only non-pink girl bikes!update: they quickly sent a replacement, but it's the wrong bike. I'm going to the local bike store now. :("
2,Unhappy,I am unhappy with this product because it gives incorrect readings. I have tried it lot's of time and so has my physician. I have a high BP and reading from this monitor is inaccurate. It always gives me normal reading. It was waste of money for me.
4,Lumiscope1145 Talking Wrist BP Monitor,"We love our Lumiscope Talking Wrist BP Monitor. Easy to use, at home or on the road. Only negative comment is that I wish it had come with a carrying case."
1,Terrible Shopping Experience,"I purchased this product from a market place vendor called AOTOline Company. This company shipped me a wrong product and charged me $6.50 shipping and handling fee. On the top of that, they asked me to ship back to product to them at my own cost, $5.00, to get my money refund. I totally spent $11.50 for the shipping experience for nothing, but a terrible experience. When I talked to the customer rep, they promised me to give me postage money back if they found it is their mistake. Nothing is communicated back. I asked them to re-ship a product to me over night because I need this product in two days for birthday gift. They said that they do not do exchange, but refund. What a terrible business operation model without consideration of customer service especially they are the one made mistake. I will not to puchase anything from this vendor."
4,good addition to Tai Chi class,I ordered this hoping to find a DVD to help me practice between weekly Tai Chi classes. This detailed DVD works well for my needs.
5,Excellent Instructional Video of the Standardised 24 forms,"It is an excellent 2 hours instructional video of the standardised 24 forms. All the instructors are of high level, and explanations are very clear. The tape has 3 parts. The first part teaches 6 Qigong exercises. The second part teaches the 7 most important/difficult movements of the form. The third is a detailed instruction of all the 24 movements. Each movement is split in several parts and it is shown from different angles. At the end of the video, there is a complete demonstration of the 24 forms from the front and from the back views. There are instructions how to use the video for learning efficiently the 24 forms. However, it isn't enough for the absolute beginner. The video assumes that the viewer has a previous training either from a teacher or from al least one of other basic videos of Dr. Lam (eg. Tai chi for older adults, Tai Chi for Health)."
3,TaiChiAficiando,"I intitially liked Paul Lam's DVD very much, but came to be somewhat disappointed in difficulty following along. It might have been better had he given several views of each move in order. For example, from the front, left, back, and right, before moving on to the next move."
3,Bought as a present,I have no idea what the quality of this DVD was or the how good the content is as I gave it as a present.
5,Excellent introduction,This is an excellent value. A full two hours of generous technical instruction.
2,"Almost useless, but could have been great","The demos of the specific moves are acceptable, but the complete sequence is impossible to follow or to use as a training aid. All the producers would have to do was to put stops and captions in the complete sequence. As a beginner trying to figure out how the moves link and transition, you are up a creek."
2,Not fun to watch,"I found that the instruction style to be irritating and made it not at all fun to watch. The instructor has a style of standing next to someone who is doing the poses and pointing to him, making comments, and only occasionally showing an alternative view. For a beginner, this takes the joy out of learning. I did like the flowing sequences showing Dr Lam at the end - too bad the producer couldn't have found a better way to shoot this."
2,Poor Production Quality,"I found this DVD to be too annoying to use. The production quality is awful, and Dr Lam's command of English is just frightful. The DVD appears to have been copied directly from a poor-quality video tape, so there are no navigation tools and no menus. You need to memorize time-stamps in order to fast forward to specific exercises."
2,Would not play on PS3,"I tried to play this DVD on my PS3 where I play all my movies and it would not play. It would load the main menu, but as soon as I made a selection it would lock up. If anyone has had success playing this on a PS3 would love to hear how."
2,Not what I thought!,"I was erolled in a Tai Chi program locally and found that although the same style was taught, the movements in the video were very different. I found it difficult to learn from the video. You need to learn in a live situation. You will find learning in a local program that it is not as difficult as it appears in the video. This is a great form of exercise. I suffered an injury and was able to adjust my movements permitting that injury to heal with my experiencing less pain. The video is good as a reference after you have learned the movements."
5,excellent for beginners,"I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to learn the yang influenced 24 forms. He also teaches six Qigong exercises and seven single movements, At the end he performs the 24 forms with a front and back view. Very well done!"
4,There Are Better DVD's Out there!,"As a student of Tai Chi and having purchased several DVD's on the subject, I have found that most of the teachers out there face the camera which makes learning very difficult because when the instructor moves left, you have to move right. This is NOT fun and very distracting. One teacher, however, Dr. Keith Jeffrey has a series called "" Tai Chi for Busy People"" He shows you several forms on the beach but then takes you into his studio which has 12 foot sections of mirrors where his back is to you do that you can perform with him and yet also see him front-wise in the mirror. This DVD, so far, has been the most effective one for me to learn by. You can find him on the web at [...]"
4,just what I needed,I found Dr Paul Lam's video very helpful. It helped me be aware of proper posture and stance and I was pleased to see that he also used a back view as the front view is difficult to follow. I recommend it as a study aide between weekly classes. I found that it kept me motivated to practise. Money well spent.
2,Good for Beginners Only,"While Dr Lam seems to be an excellent teacher, the moves are slow and repeated enough times for a beginner to follow, this DVD gives no indication of what style Tai Chi is being taught, the reasons behind the movement, the description of what they represent or anything else that is important to learn when learning Tai Chi. Also, the video quality is poor by today's standards (it looks as though it was filmed by an amateur in someone's basement). I was disappointed with the purchase."
1,Horrible,"If you are a beginner who is just somewhat curious about tai chi and thought you might get started with this video, you are wrong. This instructor is so lacking in charisma, and so boring, it is like a form of torture to watch him. He gives very detailed instructions which might be of interest to someone more advanced, but allowing 2 minutes of explanation for every finger position is intolerable to me as a beginner. Be prepared for what this is if you order it. It is more for instructors than for students."
2,Tai Chi 24 Forms,"I was disappointed in this DVD, it's obviously a older one, you are better off getting his Tai Chi for Beginners or one of the newer ones available"
1,not a workout,"This video is good to watch, but does not put things together in a way that can be followed. It is long, the segments do not give the body any kind of workout, and the complete sequence is not cued in any way. This video may be helpful for those that have taken a class, but it is useless to anyone who just wants a total body, low impact form of exercise. I bought this for my mom, watched it once, put it on the garage sale pile."
2,Good Instruction - Poor Video,The video quality of this DVD is poor. There is a good introduction to Tai Chi. The instruction was clear. I would recommend this only to someone who already does Tai Chi and wants a review of the forms.
2,Not so good,"There are several levels of taichi training, this tape teaches the first stage. The movements are there, but no mention of ying-yang hands, feet, balance, breathing, etc. So, do not expect to learn real taichi from this video."
2,Garmin all wet,Was on the deck of my kayak and did not stay waterproof even though it was rated IPX7. I contacted Garmin and got two replies.1 Thank you for contacting Garmin International.Our units are not 100% waterproof and we do not recommend you using them around water.The flat rate of repair for your unit is $125.00.2 An IPX7 designation means the GPS case can withstand accidental immersion in one meter of water for up to 30 minutes. However this does not include the unit withstanding moving or rushing water such as a current or rain or any water that may force it's way into the unit.
5,"The title is ""One ON the House"" but you get the idea.","Another wonderful tale by the author of ""Suds in Your Eye"". Why have these hysterical stories (about three ladies of a certain age, unlikely friends) been virtually lost? They are endlessly entertaining and remind the reader that kindness, empathy and a can-do attitude combine surprisingly well with beer."
2,Noisy Cooling Fan,I found this item's performance as a hard disk drive acceptable but the cooling fan was far too noisy (high-pitched mini-jet). I recommend a Buffalo Tech LinkStation Network Storage Center if low noise is a priority.
3,Very easy installation and backups but NOISY,I couldn't get over how easy it was to install this network drive! Super easy. I like the backup software included which allows you to schedule customizable automated backups that run in the background. (It works best if these run overnight since they slow things down a bit.) I agree with the reviewer who commented on the noise. It is VERY noisy. I can hear it from 2 rooms away (sounds like a distant hairdryer)... when you are sitting nearby it sounds like an airplane revving it's engines.
5,Greatest Hits a definite must,"This greatest hits CD is one of the best greatest hits collections I have ever heard. All of Blackhawk's hits are here. The CD also includes the touching song, ""Always Have, Always Will"" written and sung by Dave Robbins to his wife. The three new tracks on this CD are great compliments to the other songs. The song ""I Need You All The Time"" is a catchy, mindless fun song. Van Stephenson's ""Ships of Heaven"" is an emotional piece that makes a nice ending to the CD. This collection exemplifies what makes this band great with the harmonizing and great vocalization. This CD is a definite must for any fan of country music."
5,just plain good music,"Blackhawks greatest hits is a home run when it comes to great music. Every selection on this CD was good, not like some were a person finds one or two good selections and the reat are just ""fillers"". I would highly recommend this CD!!!!"
5,Memories!,Stacey Kent has brought back memories I thought were long gone. Her smooth and velvety style brings me back to my youth when we would dance and sing along with greats like Ella Fitzsgerald and Patty Page. I hope Ms Kent will continue to make more CDs and do it very soon. These are beautiful songs sung by someone with a beautiful voice.
1,A not-so-tender trap,"Despite Amazon's listing showing ""Audio CD January 28, 2003"", this product was recorded in early 1998 when, in my opinion, Stacey Kent had developed minimal skills as a professional recording artist. I purchased it based on my delight with later CDs like Dreamsville and In Love Again. But I listened to it once and threw it away. The problems were a combination of immature phrasing, off-pitch notes at times, the wrong song choices for her talents and, probably, some poor audio mixing. I love Stacey's later and current work but this one's a bummer."
5,This is realy new.Kent and the band are terrific.,Why has'nt there been another album???? Should not waste time
5,"Stacey was born to sing jazz, better than anyone!","One of the commentors said she ""makes strong men cry"". I'm not strong but it has the same effect on me. still after playing the CD at least five times. The musicians are first class. This CD will be a classic, if it isn't already."
5,"Stacey Kent et, al merit great praise!!","A wonderful rendition of ""The tender trap"", with Staceys classical ""nite club"" voice ringing clear as a bell. The unassuming and wonderful background combo accentinig her every phrase with occasional riffs and solo's that add to, and not take away from her perfomance. The selections were so very warm with just the right ""touch"" that I was very glad that I watched ""Sunday Morning"" when Stacey was featured. Otherwise, I would not have heard of this new star in the constellation of Jazz!"
5,Buy This CD - You'll LOVE IT!!,"If you like classic American jazz vocals sung with the elegance & phrasing of Ella, Billie, or SarahV, you will thoroughly enjoy this CD.Beautiful arrangements & great vocals make this a collection of songs you'll listen to over and over!"
5,Beautiful singing of a wonderful selection of songs.,"I have had this CD for 3 days and have not bothered to listen to anything else. As one who grew up with jazz and music of the 40s, I am deeply touched by the choice of songs and the beautiful voice and style of Stacey Kent. Keep it coming, Stacey."
5,If you love daisies...,"This sugar and creamer is both functional and decorative. If you or someone you know collects daisy items, this will be the perfect addition to the collection. These are well-made pieces that are dishwasher-safe. I love mine!"
4,good product,"It was easy to put togather, I like they way it looks as well. It has a lot of storage space on it I plan to use it as a self when he outgrows it. My son is now five months old and it is still working for us."
5,Good Buy,After searching for an inexpensive changing table I finally found this one. I have to say I'm very pleased with the product so far. The color matches my baby's crib (Honey Oak) perfectly and it seems very sturdy with lots of room on the bottom to shelves to store extra diapers and bath stuff. I'd definitely recommend this for the person on a budget!
3,Not too bad...,"I love the look of this changing table - very simple and matches other honey oaks very well (even some honey pine we have). The shelves are more spacious than I thought they would be and fit very large baskets, which is nice since there's no drawer. While the top shelf seems flimsy, the iron bar really does help stabilize it. I took off ""stars"" because the things you use to align the holes before drilling are plastic, not wood, and so they kept snapping which made assembly way more of a pain than it needed to be. It does fit standard sized changing pads (the one they give you is REALLY thin, not much of a pad at all), so that was good as well. Overall, I think we got what we paid for, and it was definitely worth the money."
3,Extra changing table,"I purchased this for a second changing table so we would have one downstairs. It is good for that purpose, was easy to put together and can fit tons of supplies on the shelves. The top shelf is very sturdy which is good because my 6 month old likes to kick, but the middle and bottom shelves are pretty flimsy so I can only put light supplies on them. Still, plenty of space there and would purchase again."
1,Dangerous table,"Beware that this table isn't made very securely. One of our cats jumped onto the bottom shelf and the shelfbroke through. Also, the other day while I was changing our baby, the top shelf broke through because one of the screws holding the metalsupport underneath came out! Thankfully I caught our baby before she fell through to the bottom. It was very scary."
3,It's OK,"This would be a great changing table if the two lower shelves had a metal bar underneath them like the top one does. I've been using this changing table for over a year but the two lower shelves are made of such cheap material that you can't put anything on them (like a basket of diapers and baby lotion) without the shelves falling off. They are completely useless. Besides that, the table is fine."
2,"Cheap wood, cheap materials","We had high hopes for this changing table as it had been rated high on Amazon & Target, but it did not live up to these expectations. The wood cracked/splintered off in several places and the screws were so light weight that they stripped and bent when my husband screwed them into the wood (and he wasn't even using an electric screwdriver). The one place where the wood cracked was at the screw hole and we had to go to the hardware store and buy an extra metal plate to try and hold the table together. It will be usable but doesn't look great with cracked wood and a big metal plate holding the leg together. We would have sent it back, but there's no way to un-assemble it since the heads of the screws are all stripped and there's no way to get them out. This is a very cheap product and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."
3,ok,the software is good. but if you look in the product discripton it does not say anything about suporting the v3xx.
4,"Great product, but not for Vista","This product would have gotten a 5 star rating except for the fact that it doesn't seem to work on Windows Vista. I have XP on my computer and it works flawlessly. The software is easy to use and interfaces with my MotoRAZRv3xx with ease. Transfering pictures, ringtones, or even video back and forth to my phone is as easy as moving things from one folder to another. The USB cable included works as its supposed to and even works to charge my Playstation3 wireless SIXAXIS controller as it interfaces with both the controller and my PS3, which is a bonus as the second controller I purchased didnt include a USB charging cord. As stated though I couldnt get the software to recognize my phone using Windows Vista on my nephews computer. But XP is no problem!"
4,Quick delivery and good customer service!,The product in question came with a defective usb cable and was promptly replaced with a new one! The customer service was quick and replaced it with no problem promptly. I will continue to do service with them based on my experience. I recommend them with no problem!
1,lie,"you say it supports v3xx, well guess what? it doesnt. if i cant find a way to manage this thing to work for my phone i will consider pressing charges"
5,Making a difference.,"""Still Groovin'"" is an excellent book of positive and necessary life examples and techniques. It is creative, stimulating and inspiring.Ruth Beckford has the genius, enlightenment and wisdom to offer affirmations that are not only for women in the second half of life, but are invaluable to young adults by settings a clear path to follow in order to become healthy and successful in mind, body and spirit. It worked for me."
5,This book was so enjoyable and enlightning,This book was for all ages. At some point in our lives we all go through one thing or another. I highly reccommend this to everyone even men.
5,Condenzio has a written a real page turner,"John Condenzio has written a page turner based on an actual ghostly happening. A writer comes to town wishing to be inspired by a gothic setting and meets several unusual characters. Condenzio had crafted strong, well written personalities, each having met the spectral visitor. Inspired scenes throughout make this a strong addition to anyone interested in the horror, retro-gothic, of ghost genres. The uniqueness is the telling opf the full story in a tripartite series of 'novellas-within-a-book'. If you liked M.R. James or even Stephen King's early ghostly tales, this one is a gotcha."
2,Hmm.,"I was interested in this subject, and the book seemed to get good reviews. The general point Condenzio is trying to get across is nonexistant. The writing is sub-par and I felt it difficult to follow along. I severely disaggreed with many things he said in this book, but i didn't let it affect my score. Poorly written."
4,"Colin Gunton, The One, the Three and the Many","Speaking as a British theologian to the English academic community, Gunton exhibits considerable erudition along with concern about the disintegration of traditional Christianized culture into what he calls ""modernism"" and ""postmodernism."" His analysis of the cultural shift reaches back to pre-Christian philosophy, from Idealism to the reality of relationships. The book is not an easy read, but for those who want to think about the course of the American culture, it is informative and stimulating."
4,"Loved the book, BUT board book version is DIFFERENT","This is a great little book. We renewed it several times at the library, and finally decided to buy it. The little verses are charming, and the artwork is wonderful. BUT when we bought the board book version at Amazon, the verses were missing! It took away all the fun. It's still a nice book, but there are thousands like it out there. The verses really set it apart."
5,Memories From My Childhood,"Some of these songs of wisdom, i had heard from my grandparents. It sure it educational to see this all in print. I have something share and leave to my grandchildren. This is not being taught in any system. All this historical information is a great and learning to all our young people. This is enchancement for them and gives them a sense of pride in themselves. I highly recommend this for library reading in our shcools."
2,Wish other review was here before,"I got this case Dec. 06 and had it on my phone the whole time. The dust does get under the case and I figured it was a small price to pay to protect the phone. As the other poster mentioned the dust can damage the phone (I didn't realize this) and there are a few marred areas now. Also this case actually damaged my phone, it's supposed to protect it from scratches not create them. There are two edges on the inside of the front cover they seemed harmful, but my phone now has scratch lines where these two edges were :(I only give it two stars as it did protect my phone in a fall."
2,It's OK but not what I'd expected,"I""ve got a product (RED) razr v3m and I didn't want to conceal that nice red color with a standard case so I went for this clear one. The case came in a plastic bag shipped in a jet pack. When I opened it there were already scratches on the case. The case did fit the phone perfectly but it actually took away from the phone's good looks. Additionally, after a few days I noticed that dust was getting between the case and the phone which could mar the phone's finish, so I removed the case. I plan to return this case and go with some type of leather one instead."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought this leas for my 14 pound Poodle cross. I purchased one for a dog larger than him, as retractable leashes make me wary.I loved the leash at the start. The design is awesome.About a month after I bought it, my dog saw a squirrel across the road. He didn't hit the end of the leash hard, but he was pulling (as much as a dog his size could). After no more than 5 seconds, the line snapped. My dog ran across 4 lanes of traffic immediately. I was lucky he was not struck and killed due to this defective product.Planet Dog was contacted, and never got back to me. Thanks a lot."
2,Not long enough,"Bought the medium leash, description said leash was 10ft, when received, the package said 6 feet. Did not even open package, don't really need a leash to be retractable if it is only 6 ft long."
4,Excellent.,"I purchased this a year ago for my Labrador/Airedale mix. (70lb)The handle fits very nicely in the palm of your hand, coupled with the loop on the end offers a great range of ways to hold it.While the case is extremely durable, with a good solid weight to hold on to, the ribbon does APPEAR to be substantially weaker than it actually is.I'm confident the 75lb rated version would take upwards of double that to actually break, the handle/mechanism itself far, far more.I probably have several hundred miles of walking done on the one I'm currently using, with a very energetic mid-sized dog, so, as you can imagine, it's taken quite a beating. It doesn't look that impressive, as I said, but it IS far more durable than you'd ever believe without experience.The winding mechanism is still nice and springy, with a decent amount of pull to keep the slack up.Though the cord is only 6', sadly, which limits this leash, it is made very well and overall the absolute best $35 I've ever spent."
1,Not great for the price,"I recieved the leash and it did not seem sturdy enough for my bigger dog even though she is with in the weight limits. I returned it, this is the first thing from planet dog I have gotten that I didn't like. They do have great toys!"
3,Not quite what expected but still happy,Product came Extremely fast!! Ordered on Friday & got it on Wednesday. Quite impressed with that.One thing that was not clear in the description or the picture was that there is a 20in long piece after the retractable mechanism that does NOT retract. It is pictured with a length extended but it is not made clear that it does not retract. I expected it to retract all the way like every other retractable leash. The product description needs to explain that a little better. I was a little upset at this. When I want as short leash on my Mini Aussie I want it SHORT. I can cut it off & make it work but for $25 I should not have to modify it.Otherwise I am very happy with it. The loop for your hand seems pretty comfortable & should give great control. Will know better when I use it. At work right now so will walk the monster later.
5,GREAT DOG LEASH,This is a great leash for a small dog. It is comfortable to wear on the wrist and is small and lightweight. Very easy to use.
3,"Great Idea, Only Lasted 3.5 mos with my Golden","It's a great idea and was a real pleasure to use, until the spring broke after 3.5 mos of use."
3,So So,It is great that you can wrap it around your wrist and go. It is HORRIBLE for the beach because the grains of sand get inside the mechanism and ruin it. This is meant for neighborhood walking in non-muddy and low key environments.
3,6' in length only,"I like the style of this product especially that we have 2 dogs & we haven't found a splitter that we liked for our routine walks; we tried many. This slips over the wrist allowing your hands to be free if desired. I love the belted retractables as it burns bare skin less severely than cord leashes & are ""safER""...but I can't seem to find the 1st of this kind of leash we bought a long time ago which was longer anywhere! This is only 6' in length which is ok & is safer. We live in a quiet neighborhood & when we're not in training, I'd like our hounds to sniff as they please (to a certain extent) to stimulate their minds as well as bodies. Please bring back the longer version (although, I think it was a cord retractable)!"
5,Magyar Moved Me,"As I read Lipiner's recount of his grandfather's journey and struggles, it occured to me that this should be on every student's required reading list. It depicts a holocaust survivor's odyssey from his Hungarian homeland through Nazi Europe, back to his home, and eventually to the land of opportunity, America."
3,interesting,"I grew up in this town, or the village close to it, Lakeville, so it was personal for me. Herzog could have used a proofreader, but his framework was interesting, told from the vantage point of the murdered man. I'd recommend it."
2,I Am A Child And Did Not Get The Game,I Read The Directions Over And Over And I Still Didnt Understand It!!
2,"Slow, yet somehow good...","The Takers was probally only good to me beause of the historical story in it. But It didn't stay fast paced as it should, and I still am struggling to finish it. I found that the author, seemed to know his guns and that I didn't care for. I really didn't want to know that he carried a 32. magnum la dee da da da... Whatever. But I can't ssy it was a bad book beacause I don't think any books are bad, and my opinion shouldn't provoke people in their Decission to buy or read it, But If I had known what it was like, I would not of taken the libirtey of reading it, It was still a time passer. ~Isriah~ Weasel~"
5,Best Cream For A Rash,"My son has very sensitive skin. In the cold, dry weather, during the winter months his skin would get very dry and sometimes he would get a rash that was very itchy. This cream cleared it up in one day."
4,good,"This is a best product I ever use, my skin look firm and shine,I really feel satisfy with this product."
2,I know why they call it quiet!,"I've had this pump for about 10 days and it's been running fine. I did a water change today in preparation for a vacation I'm taking this week. After changing the water I turned on the pump and it didn't work. It's a tight fit in my sump, so it's not easy getting it in/out. I got it out, checked it again in a bucket of water, and got nothing. I could hear and feel it humming, but no pumping. I dismantled it and checked it out. Being just 10 days old it was very clean. I reassembled it, and viola! It worked! I wedged back into my sump, started it up again, and nothing. Long story short, third time's a charm. It's working now, but for how long? Very unsettling. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Costly Repair,"The pump was fine while it ran, but for a reason unknown the impeller shaft broke. A new impeller shaft, without the impeller, costs almosr half od what the pump costs. For an impeller shaft! The sahft and impeller costs almost as much as the entire pump. I think that's absurd, thus the poor rating. I'm going to try and glue the old shaft back together - if that doesn't work I'll be forced to get a new impeller shaft, or buy another pump."
2,A better choice could be made.,I bought this for my Evolt E-500 to help extend the length of the lens to take photos of my son's football games. I am not a professional photographer and simply take photos for fun. To use this lens I had to zoom the lens all the way out otherwise there was a black hole created. When I did take photos of the action the zoom lens did capture the action far away but it was not the best quality and somewhat fuzzy. In my opinion I would stick to the lens's meant for this camera to avoid this type of problem.
3,Cute but very bulky,"Got this toy as a gift and it is cute but really big. It takes up a lot of room in the toybox and only has about 3 repeat sounds it makes when you push the button. Wasnt that crazy about it neither was my son. My infant sometimes plays with it now, she mostly just walks around carrying it by handle. There are better toys out there."
5,Great for imagination play!,"Our 1 year old just received this toy, but our 2 1/2 year old stole it and won't give it up. Just like all little people's toys the figures are great sizes for little hands, the toys are fun and easy to play with.The plane says lots of different things, the only problem I can think of is it comes with cute cardboard cut outs of kids sitting in the seats, I wish that was part of the actual windows.Would definitely buy for my kids."
5,Great Toy,"Little ones love flying the plane, taking the passengers in/out or driving the plane on the floor. Top handle is great to hold on to plane. Hours of enjoyment!!"
5,Airplane,I bought 2 of these for Christmas gifts for 1 and a half year old boys. Both loved them as soon as they were opened. Lots of fun lights and sounds and they loved moving the little people in and out of the plane.
2,Nice toy but difficult to play with,The airplane seats 4 dolls but only comes with 3. Not a big deal but the dolls are really hard to get in and out of the slots. I bought it as a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter and her mom told me about the problem with it. Not much fun to have a toy that you can't really play with.
3,gifts,Are gifts for my great-grandson but Fisher-Price has always been great products since my children were small. They have outlasted the children and grandkids.
5,little people lil' movers airplane,This item is really cute a good size for a 1 to 3 year old. My one year old Grandson loves it.
5,airplanes,this is one of my 3 yr grandsons gift for christmashis grandpa is an aircraft mechaniche loves to fly in planes this toy will take him very far
2,cute but not worth the money,"My son got this Fisher-Price Little People Lil' Movers Airplane for his first birthday-- I really don't see why this product has such high reviews! There is not much to this toy, and it doesn't keep my son's attention for very long. The song it plays is pretty cute, but other than that there is not much to say about this toy! It's definitely not worth spending $20 on!-- maybe more like $12."
4,"Cute and Fun,,,",My Son is almost 3 and likes Cars and Airplanes..He knows the song by heart.. and sings along with it.Little People toys are made very well.. and are fun and educational.
3,"Not truly age appropriate for ""Ages 1 - 4.""",My 2 1/2 year old is not interested in this at all; it is more appropriate for a younger child. I def. would not get it for a 3 or 4 year old. Also the photos show several Little People in the plane and it only comes with the pilot.
5,Great Toy,"My daughter got this for her first birthday, and absolutely loves it! It keeps her attention for much longer than most toys. It is well made, and the sounds effects and songs are great, not tinny or grating like some toys that make noise. (And on a purely ""nice-to-see"" note, the pilot of the airplane is female!) I highly recommend it!"
4,"If you love the school bus, you'll love the plane!!!","My son received the Fisher Price School Bus for his first birthday and LOVED it, so I figured he would love this airplane as well. He enjoys swapping out the little people and opening and closing the doors. A fun toy, cute sound effects and song.The only downside to the airplane compared to the school bus is that the opening is a smaller than the bus. For little hands, it's not a problem, but when you have all the airplane seats filled, it can be a little tight..."
5,Great Toy,Fisher-Price hit another home run with this one. Good quality and delighted my one year old grandson. This toy will be one of those that's kept and handed down.
3,Came VERY Dirty,"We ordered this toy via Amazon, and when I took it out of the box it is FILTHY.Covered in a layer of dust, which I have to use a Q-tip to get out of all the tiny crevices inside the plane. Ew.Also, the toy itself was scuffed up when it arrived. I didn't notice until I started opening the toy for my kidsto play with.Next time I'm going to be careful to inspect the things I order."
5,fun toy!,purchased for my 18 month old nephew who loves it! My four your old got this as a baby and still plays with it along with his 1 year old brother.
5,All Day Entertainment,The quality of the product was excellent. This items was given as a gift to a 2 year old little girl. Her parents said she plays with it all the time. The gift was a hit!
5,ADORABLE Airplace,Love this piece - but you really can't beat Fisher-Price for little folks! This hasn't been played with yet - it's under the tree - but I know he will love it.
4,Nice but scratched,"This toy is really cute, but it did come with some scratches on it and some black marks that I can't get off."
4,Excellent Toy,"Eons ago and far away, I had a little Fisher Price plane of my own. It was less stylized, more realistic looking, did less (fewer things, too) and it was better. However, this little plane here is really great too.It's built quite tough, and allows for imaginative play. The plane sounds are pretty good and not annoying because they only sound for a couple of seconds while the pilot is being pressed down.There is one song it plays that I do find annoying, however, again it's no problem, because 1. It is short and 2. It can be changed with another quick tap on the pilot.I recommend it. It has already gotten much more use than many other toys."
4,Subtle messages?,"We bought this airplane for our little girl after she began to spot every airplane in the sky no matter how far away it was. She enjoys flying it around and will dance to the music it plays. But after looking at it for a while, I realized there are NO male characters as part of this toy. I have no problem with a female pilot, but NO male characters? seems a little odd. And we didn't buy the pink airplane. The little people are also quite butch in appearance. Just interesting to notice the subliminal messages in our kids toys. Kind of like the number 69 i saw on the picture of the firetruck on our baby einstein exersaucer. very unnecessary."
3,Just ok,Popular toy but my son could care less for it. Wish i would have not purchased. It is sitting in the bottom of his toy chest. Plus the price was pretty steep
5,Recomendado!,"El producto fue recibido en muy buenas condiciones, absolutamente nada de que quejarme. Soy de Venezuela y recomiendo este producto."
5,Fun for little ones,"I got this for my friends 18 month old little boy and he loves it! It makes noises and he has learned to make it ""fly"" off the couches."
3,Good toy,"I bought this for my 21 month old son who loves airplanes. He enjoys the sounds & song it plays when pushing the pilot down, and likes the up and down motion when rolling the plane on the ground, and opening and closing the door. Altho he generally plays really well by himself, this toy doesn't hold his interest too long. When i play with him, he will use it more, but he is really into moving parts, and this only has a door that opens and the people who move. So, if your child isn't so into moving and manipulating parts of a toy, this would be great. He does enjoy it here and there, but he totally prefers Mr. Potato Head becuase it is much more interactive."
5,Great toy for kids that love airplanes,This toy was bought for my grandson who is so in love with airplanes. He is only 20 months old but this was the ideal present for him.
2,OK but not great,They toy is nice but my son got bored of it really fast. They only thing we likes doing is press down the pilot and listen to the sounds it makes. Still there are not much you can do with this toy. I guess it is better for infants and not for toddlers
4,Cute,"I bought this for my grandson. He's too young to play with it now. When shown to him, his eyes and smile lit up to the sounds of the plane. Hopefully when he's older, this toy will be played with alot. I gave this a four star because its so adorable. By the way, I bought this toy yesterday at Target for $9.00.Edited:This plane is very durable. It has been banged on so many times. The little people included are still in great shape. The music still plays, and aside from some minor marks, the plane looks good. My granddaughter has played with it at times also. It's been almost three years now since buying the plane. Since my grandson is older, it does not get much play time. The product does state up to three years old. I did see him playing with it one day, which I was surprised. Right now, his interest lies more with dinosaurs and cars."
2,Not Interesting,"18 month old is not at all interested in this toy - it does not do much: 2-3 short audios, small lights and figures move slightly when plane is pushed. I would opt for another toy than this."
2,Airplane Isnt All That Great,"I bought this for my little girl, she was about 1yr at the time, and I think I played with that thing more than she did! Its bulky, hard to get the little people in & out of, only has a few ""sound effects"", and its really not that fun of a toy - its kind of boring. I rarely rate anything this low, but when I saw this listed at 30 dollars I couldn't believe it! I know I didn't pay that much for mine & believe me it is Not Worth that much!"
2,Something is wrong with this price??!?,"OK, i just came across the toys on this page, and noticed that this little airplane toy is listed at $68, which is NOT correct. I got the same toy a year ago and paid less than $15 for it. Can you guys please correct this error??"
1,Not worth $35!,"1. This plane is too bulky for any kind of pretend play involving flying - so kind of beats the whole idea of buying a toy airplane!2. The four or five pre-recorded sounds get stale in like 4 minutes.3. There is very limited motion/activity in the toy itself.My son has taken to using it as a storage box for his Lego mega blocks and the only thing he finds interesting in it is the people, which he has taken out and plays with separately. He also refuses to call the toy an airplane and instead calls it ""car"" and ""truck"" interchangeably.Not worth $35. Maybe if the price were more like $10-15, it would be a nice colorful piece of plastic on wheels to add to the clutter, but definitely not worth the high price tag!!!"
5,good push toy,"My 16 month old daughter enjoys pushing this plane around and pressing the pilot to make the sounds and music. She also enjoys putting the people in and taking them out. Its a good size for her, with no sharp areas to fall on. It would be good for younger children, as well. Sometimes, my 3 year old son likes to play with it, too. I'd say it was a good purchase."
1,Toy is not worth the money,I bought this toy for my 18-month old daughter. This toy is not worth the money as it really does not do much.It has just 4 phrases that it keeps repaeating - only 1 of those is a song which catches some attention. The rest of the toy is quite useless & does not stimulate a child in any way. Do not waste your money on this - absolutely not worth it!
5,gave it to grandchild,"Got this for my lil pumkin and she loves it.It has sound,but not as loud and obnoxious as some.It lets her use her imagination and I think kids toys don't let them use it that much anymore."
5,Look up in the sky,"My grand son lives close to the airport, so he is always looking at all the plains in the sky. and saying hi plain hi so fisher price has a great plain for him to play with"
4,Silly purchase,"I call this a silly purchase as it's a fun way to spend money. Really, though, it works well unless the edge of the table is angled instead of a 'straight' cut. My bags range from really heavy to almost empty and it works well either way. The storage bag it comes with is worthless, hence the 4 out of 5 - it needs to be bigger."
3,"Jazz, But Not Jazzy","There's absolutely nothing wrong with Dynamic 4's ""My Favourite Beats."" This is workhorse jazz, happily formulaic, something that you might hear played in an elevator, over the intercoms of a discount clothing store, or in the dim background of a mostly-empty hotel lounge/bar while customers don't even try to pretend that they aren't flirting shamelessly with one another.Unapologetically simple, this album follows all the rules, never deviates from the norm, and steadfastly refuses to experiment with anything. This record is about as dangerous and remarkable as a grilled cheese sandwich. It's fine and dandy as part of the unobtrusive backdrop of a quiet get-together or maybe even some PG-13 rated snuggling. But don't bother looking for anything with frills or talent; all Dynamic 4 has to offer is vanilla-flavored jazz."
3,Don't be fooled by cheap pet stairs-these are the BEST,"The Bear's 6 Step Pet Stairs was purchased for my Maltese. He will have his 10th birthday in a few months and was having difficulty jumping up onto a foot stool next to the bed, sometimes he would hurt his shoulders from jumping off the bed. The bed is 26"" high and the cheap 4 steps was only 16' high, so I knew that that 10"" difference would be too great as he got older. It took me one evening to teach my Maltese to go up and down the steps by trailing treats. Now my Shih Tzu is folling him up and down the steps. They both feel secure with this strong stable stairs to the bed. The construction is terrific and will provide many years of use for both pets. I will be ordering a smaller Tiny version for the sofa."
5,As advertised!,"Great product. Much better price then you would find in most pet shops, and very convenient to have the carbon already bagged and ready to drop in. All you need to do is rinse!"
4,Fluval FX5,"These are pretty nice. You get three small bags of carbon. I should have figured out how much 330G was because they are kind of small for the Fluval FX5. I put two in my filter and I could still fit two more if I wanted. Next time I am going to buy the filter bags and just fill them up with carbon. This is cheaper then you will find at local pet stores, but I think I should be able to get more for my money if I fill my own filter bag."
3,"LIke Interpol, but chasing Dracula instead of Mr. X","So, here we have oour stantard Fantasy Flight game: really good components, the square box, the square rule book, the cards (a LOT of cards, always!), a playing time adviced as 2-3 hours that usually means 4 hours minimum, the disrespectful small type fonts used int the cards that seem to appeal only to young people, a high price, probable expansions coming around the corner.Fury of Dracula is a cooperative game of four against one (Dracula), travelling through Europe trying to kill the evil blood sucker. The game allows imagination ad some kind of RPG while trying to visualize what is happening, and this will mean a lot of laughs. The combat system seemed to me really creative and original (and a lot tense!). There are rules devised to difficult or to ease the chancees of Dracula escaping.A good and fun game (but, Fantasy Flight, please put bigger types in the cards!)"
4,A First for me......,"I read this in '99. It is a very hot and erotic story, I had never read anything like this before. I have just come back to get the next one, but I can see that it is out of stock. If your adventurous and have an open mind pick this one up, you won't be disappointed, and you won't be able to put it down either..."
5,Handel opera (Rodelinda) Review,1. Content - Perfect2. Delivery - Very Good.3. Total impression - very satisfied.
4,"Good Looking, Many Features, A few complaints","This watch looks very good. The sturdy metal case & band gives it a solid look & feel. It has many features, a good display and is fairly simple to operate. Remember, though, that this is a watch so some things in the display are a little small and entering some data is a little tedious but the features are very usable. Complaints? The band is a little tricky to latch and it took me a week or two to get used to it. It's easy to adjust the size, though. And it pulls my hairs and that's a pain. The only other complaint is that many websites selling this model list it as water resistant. But according to the product manual, this model has no water resistance. Note that this model is not listed on the Casio website."
2,"Oh, come on!",This is designed and built sooo cheap. I can not believe it is Coleman! Do not waste your money. No one who cares about their garage would use this!
2,"Great Anticipation, Disappointing Results","When I originally saw this book, I was highly interested because I find Colorado to be a beautiful state and photographic history to be a fascinating topic. Unfortunately, many of the retakes are uninteresting (as stated in another review) and are technically lacking (poor choice in time of day, cloud cover, or just flat out blown highlights (I counted eight photographs with blown highlights on a cursory glance through the book)).On the plus side, the historical images are worth examining -- simply seeing photographs over 130 years old is intriguing, and the descriptions accompanying these photographs give you a sense of just how pioneering a lot of this work was.I don't own Colorado I, I have a hard time imagining that it would be as disappointing as Colorado II. The historical photographs are beyond reproach, but I can't shake the feeling that Fielder barely gave any compositional consideration to the modern photographs."
5,A lovely companion volume,"For those who enjoyed the first volume, Volume II is a lovely companion book. In an interview, John Fielder explained that he could only put so many photos in the first volume, but going back through the hundreds of pictures that didn't make it in, he realized there were many more that were just as deserving to be published. I'm thrilled to include this book in my collection and highly recommend it for Colorado history lovers."
2,Get the Original Soundtrack instead,"I bought this Soundtrack along with the Original one because I noticed this had a bunch more tracks.Ugh, the tracks are just a few snippets of dialogue from the movie. You will probably listen to them once and never again.The sound, there is something not quite right about it. The piano doesn't sound a crisp as it does on the Original Soundtrack. I played this disc about 2x and put it away forever."
4,"20th Anniv. edition provides some nice ""Halloween"" extras","John Carpenter's (complete w/ the Bowling Green Orchestra) ""Halloween"" score is dark and chilling, just like it's suppose to be. Nice dialogue snippets from the film add to the music's gothic touch, as well! Digitally remastered from the original 1983 release, too. Carpenter's musical minimalism makes this extra suspensful 20th Anniversary Edition, complete w/ all the stuff from the original recording plus more, worth buying this October. Be sure to check out the Halloween II soundtrack, for more chills."
4,THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD CD.,"This CD is pretty good. The only problem is that there are too many songs and a lot of them sound the same. There is a lot of talking on some of the songs, but other than that, the music is creepy and will scare the living daylights out of you. I wouldn't be caught dead listening to it after dusk. But all in all, I think you would be better off getting the original soundtrack."
1,Halloween 20th Anniversary???,The Halloween 20th Anniversary soundtrack kinda sucks!!!! Because the tracks 10: The Haunted House and Track 16 are the same tracks but played longer!!! You shouldn't waste your money on this crap!!!!
5,"A Score Like no Other....Emulated, But Never Equaled","Halloween is perhaps the best horror film after Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"". A lot of the film's terror is due to Carpenter's terrifying, unique score. The music keeps the same theme throughout the film and is relentless to give up on the viewer from the beginning to the end. This makes the viewer realize that they are watching a horror film and not some fickle teenage slasher film with intermintent sex rumbles accompanied by cheesy, romantic music. rather, Carpenter's score keeps the viewer biting his nails and jumps out with shock tactics that are similar to Hermann's Psycho score. Halloween's music has been emulated, but never matched in the horror genre. A must buy CD--and film!!!"
2,Halloween:20 anniversary Edition,It is what is says it is. Soundtrack with voice overs.It is not just the music part of the soundtrack.Wanted just the music.
5,Must Have for any Horror Movie Fan,"This CD is a digitally remastered version of the original Halloween soundtrack. All of the music from the greatest horror movie of all time is on this CD. The unforgettable opening title sequence starts off the CD. Also included are audio clips of some of the most memorable lines from the movie. With all of the added tracks on this CD, it is almost like the entire movie has been put on to one CD. If you do not already own this CD, make sure it is the next soundtrack you buy."
3,A Halloween Treat,"All of Halloween's great score is included here in its original glory. John Carpenter's masterful piano work can really be appreciated here, along with all of the other instruments he uses (and there are a lot of them). If you've seen the movie as many times as I have, you're probably numb to the ""surprises"" by now, but this CD will actually make you jump. With the creepy dialogue and sound effects, this is the perfect album to listen to on Halloween night."
4,Good Stuff Here,"Each actual song is terrific. Like others, I could do without the silly dialogue littered throughout the disc. For hardcore Halloween fans only."
5,HALLOWEEN; 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION-ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK,HALLOWEEN; 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION-ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK IS A GREAT SOUNDTRACK FOR THE MONEY AND IT HAS A GREAT SOUND QUALITY TO IT !
1,This seller is a cheater!,"Length:: 0:25 MinsThis seller is a cheater, please don't buy from this seller. I have ordered for the Brinkmann Black Max Spotlight, but i received a Brinkmann LED Armormax. I was charged $62.92 for the Spotlight but they have send me a LED torch light which is $21.00. I didn't raise a compliant as i came to know about it after 45 days."
5,Funniest Audio Book EVER!,"Let me just say, I LOVE this audio book. It is really a movie on audio because it is fully acted with sound effects all the way through and the story is worthy of being on film. One day we'll annoy Bruce enough that he'll agree to do it. I have never laughed so hard in my life. This is absurdity and intrigue as only Bruce Campbell could produce. Chin up! And buy this audiobook."
4,Great Book,"The book provides a thoughtful informative view of how to use the Business Intelligence features of Visual Studio and SQL Server. Each chapter appropriately builds on the previous information.The reader is presented with an introduction to Business Intelligence. Next, the construction of a cube using Analysis Services is explained and later the use of Integration Services is illustrated. Lastly, working the data with MDX queries is discussed and then the final data is displayed with Reporting Services.I recommend the book to beginners and intermediate developers."
3,Save a tree,"OK -- it's not terrible, but it reminds me of many books that start with ""this is a field, this is a record, this is a table."" It started fine - I learned the difference between star and snowflake schema, the benefits of a data mart, and the key feature of SQL 2005 Analysis Services that addresses the latency between OLTP and OLAP (it's a feature called Universal Data Model (UDM). All cool. The trouble begins in the subsequent chapters with the cutesy MaximumMinimum company and the painstaking, step-by-step ""now you do it"" approach. Which means you can only make use of the info if you're sitting in front of a computer. Not my cuppa."
1,Do Not Bother!,"As a beginner to BI, I must say this book was a waste! Incredibly long lists of directions, with no way to recover if even one step is off. A hundred page interlude stuck in middle with definitions which could of been read in BOL. Might have been ok if he hadn't tried to throw in a half-passed intro to Integration Services."
4,Delivering Business Intelligence with Microsoft SQL Server 2005,"This is overall a very good read for those who like the hands on approach to learning. The author certainly knows the topic.Being new to this topic, I found it very easy to get lost in the details of the step by step examples, quite often forgetting the objective of the exercise which are often several pages long!There are also errors in some of the examples which are not so obvious tofix without the help of google. ( Tip for Vista users, dont use the Fox Pro drivers in the download get the latest from Microsoft) This is especially frustrating for newcomers when the error does not often surface until you are executing later examples (the examples in this book, base on each other)Please dont let my comments put you off buying this excellent book. For beginners, expect to have to read the book more than once."
4,a Good First Start,"This is a good starting book on the subject , it could certainly have been better if author did not postpone delivering to the end but he could shows in excel pivot table example with each step along the way so reader can see directly results of certain actions , but anyway it's a good book and prepare yourself for at least another one in the subject after reading this one"
4,a good start,"This book is not going to make anyone a SQL Server 2005 expert. But for me it was perfect. I have been designing BI solutions for years, using Oracle or DB2 with Cognos or Hyperion. I have started using Microsoft now, and going through book helped a lot. I don't feel that I'm a MS expert after reading this, but I do feel comfortable with the SQL Server 2005 services.Think of it this way, it's a good beginner's book for SQL Server Database, Analysis services, Reporting Services, and Integration services - all in one book."
5,Great Footage,It's been a long time since we've seen Walter run. Show this tape who anyone who doesn't believe that Walter is the best ever!
4,Pretty good,"Pretty representative of Walter's career. He directed this himself, so it is exactly what he wanted the public to see"
3,Good but not complete,"Not quite as personal or probing as the ESPN Sports Century biographical piece was, but this video is still enjoyable to watch, with a lot of great plays, and some insight into Sweetness' life."
2,physics envy,"Historically interesting--the famous word association test is mentioned here--but Jung is at his worst when trying to squeeze psyche into a causal framework. Early in his career, however, that was how it was done, and he broke out of it later while Freud did not."
2,Started out great.... but fizzled fast,"The first 50 pages of this book were quite entertaining. But the remaining 150 pages were mediocre. Their trip through Latin America consisted mostly of getting drunk and picking up prostitutes. One bright note: It was interesting to learn of the difficulties the author encountered as he crossed from one border to another. However, I was expecting more from this book and was kinda disappointed."
1,Missing a part,"Missing a part. I emailed Superior. Part did not arrive yet, after 3 weeks.I guess that I will have to fight to send it back too.Dont but from Superior. Customer service STINKS"
5,They work,"Just the thing for beefing up the carrying capacity of our Minivan. Pulls our boat and trailer with no sag. Makes carrying a few hundred pounds of feed in the back a breeze. Worth the $$$$, easy to install unless you're a moron."
3,Help A Little,"I got these to help the tired leaf springs on my 1990 Toyota pickup. They did not provide any lift, but I believe they helped with the springs. Don't expect them to give you enough lift for bigger tires or extremely heavy loads."
1,Not worth the money,"Had one of these die on me on Cycle Day 8, which meant I was out for the entire month. The next month, it told me I was entering my fertile phase two days AFTER my ovulation... and I had a 28-day cycle that month, too. OvWatch will mess with your hopes and lie to you outright!"
1,Would give it a 0,"See the reviews for the watch. Other than whether or not the watch does anything more than count like the on-line calendars is up for debate but I think the biggest problem is these sensors that can't seem to last long enough to get through a cycle...Even with doing the water trick in their guidebook...Also since the band on the watch is so small, you have to undo it when putting it on/off (lots of fun with one hand) otherwise you run the risk of snapping the little tabs on the sensor which renders the sensor useless.DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT OR THE WATCH"
1,No illustrations!,"I downloaded the book onto my computer thinking that the illustrations would be there, but sadly they are not. The book is useless without out them!"
1,Some Good Comparisons for Dating Tools... Tedious Reading,"First... Amazon did a fine job of delivering the book(s). Second... The book has some good information on dating some tools. Third... Previous readers were right. There should be a statement in the front of the book that Moxon's & Roubo's books are a PREREQUISITE to reading this book as the author makes loads of references to illustrations in their books. Fourth... The bad news. This book must have been written for a larger format publication where several illustrations could all be placed on a single large page. I don't believe any of the text referring to an illustration actually has that picture on the same page (or facing page) I was reading at the time. (I could be wrong because I was constantly flipping back & forth between text & pictures.) Some of the text is actually 8 pages away from the picture, sometimes forward of the text you are reading & sometimes backward. This book makes for a very tedious read."
1,Def Poetry Jam is awful and insulting,"OK, this review is not about the book, it's about the live Def Poetry Jam production, I apologize, but I'm so angry after seeing it on December 12, I'm posting negative reviews wherever possible. If you want to have your intelligence insulted with crackpot theories about how the US government staged 9/11, then by all means spend your hard-earned dollars on this garbage, be it the show or the book. Otherwise, vote with your money and tell these hate-mongers to take a hike."
4,"Nice and Simple, Good Price","Works just great! Price very reasonable. Great free shipping- three days earlier than estimate arrival. I now have two 22"" monitors. The only negative about this beautiful product is lack of swiveling up and down."
3,Great value though not as good as expected,"After researching this monitor extensively on the web I chose it for my office. As far as value goes it was the best choice. The picture quality is not quite as good as the 15"" Samsung it replaced but the vast acreage it provides more than makes up for it in this situation.My disappointment is that the stand is not adjustable. I confirmed that with Acer tech support. Apparently they used to make them adjustable because a number of people have commented on how it was rather flimsy. Unfortunately now they are in a fixed position and even worse it leans slightly towards you. I've had to place a notebook under it to get it to lean back a little. It is not as stable as I would have liked. If you have the money, I'd suggest a Samsung for the better picture and better stand. If you are willing to put up with some limitations to save some money then it seems workable."
4,A great value,"For the price, this is a great monitor. I went to all of the stores on line and in person and couldn't find a better deal for a 22"" monitor."
5,Happy Customer!,"It's great! A beautiful monitor. A very high quality product and excellent value. Its large size lets me see much more, work faster and easier too. I can see many files at once, or let a large image or spreadsheet fill the screen and see all of it well."
2,Doesnt support all cards,Doesn't support 7300 GT's in SLI mode. Settings don't get saved when i restart and i have to continually mess with resolution settings to get a decent (at best) picture. for sure i will be returning this product.
1,Stuck pixel makes this a bad unit,Mine arrived from Amazon with a bright stuck pixel in the middle of the screen. Intolerable for use a monitor. Acer should have better quality control then this. Do not buy this monitor.
1,Acer Aspire 5100 notebook,I purchased this model LXAX90X2357231159811601 in Aug.07 and it working in Oct.08. I ordered off ShopNBC for over $1000.00. My warranty was over and I could not get proper help and finally after 1 hours 47 minutes I soke with a human being. I had taken this computer to 2 other computer companies and both agreed the motherboard was out. WHY? Customer Service from Corp. was very poor and I do not recommend this notebook. Buyer be aware be very aware! I wish I could have gotten some help and understanding from Acer. I'm just not important enough to Acer now that I own a new broken laptop and can not afford the $450.00 charge for them to look into this problem.
2,Cheap in more ways than one,"Originally this monitor seemed like a great buy, but it's proven to be nearly impossible to correctly calibrate. Quality as compared to my 19"" Viewsonic is fairly poor; text doesn't render as well, the color temperature varies dramatically across the face of the monitor (blueish on the left and definitely pink on the right!), and text is a bit harder to read. There was also a stripe down the monitor which went away when I adjusted the angle - after turning bright blue! I'd keep looking and pay more for a better quality monitor. It's the thing you stare at all day, after all. For movies it might be OK as long as you don't mind a huge color shift from side to side."
4,Great monitor for the price,"I was looking for a monitor to serve as my home base for my laptop(s) -- both a Sony Vaio and a MacBook Pro. I found the picture quality better for the Vaio, but alas, the screen on the MacBook Pro has spoiled me. The width and setup/controls are awesome, but the colors aren't thousand-dollar rich -- of course, since the monitor only cost two fifty, I pretty much got what I paid for!In a fair world, I'd give this 5 stars... because it is amazing for the price. Maybe 4.5 would be more indicative of how I feel.If you're looking for a HUGE low-budget monitor with strong performance, you can buy this and you will definitely not be disappointed."
2,text rendering issues,"much of the text has a pink and some a greenish stain behind it, like a stain,some characters even appear to be purple. I have done all I know to correct the issue with no success so I'm returning it as defective. was not an issue with my old viewsonic. I have tried reinstalling video drivers, reinstalling cleartype, and all the montor settings with no luck in getting rid of the problem. this monitor is probably defective because I have a friend who has the acer and loves it. Just bad luck I hope since the reviews are excellent. I'm returning this one and not taking another chance and getting the samsung syncmaster with much better results I hope."
1,One year progress report. Display has dim/brown-out area. Indian support has asked me opening questions 5 times now.,"I was very happy at first with my new Acer display. After just one year, it has developed a dim/brownish-yellow area about 5"" x 5"" in the upper right area of the display. I contacted Acer ""Tech Support"" and have been answering the same broken English questions over and over about if I have dropped it, or will I please re-boot the system...over and over to different people (never the same person twice, even though each one says they will take care of my problem). My question was immediately placed in the ""Solved"" status on their follow-up expert system, and each new person treats my plead for help as a brand new event. Sick display, and lame support."
5,"Acer AL2216Wbd 22"" LCD Monitor - Black","The monitor got shipped in perfect condition, there are no dead pixels, everything looks great. Definitely worth the price: $225 - $50 MIR."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this monitor 9 months ago. Decent picture, brigthness , response time. Worked fine for 6 months then suddenly started displaying lots of striped lines. I sent it back for warranty, and Acer fixed it pretty fast. But packaging/shipping cost me $50. Low price => low quality. I wouldn't buy acer again in near future."
3,Defective upon arrival!,"I had to return the monitor to amazon, because of a dead pixel, the first time i turned it on. Still waiting on a refund to my card! Was told to wait another 2-3 weeks.... Very dissapointed with how everything has been handled by amazon! Product itself is decent, contrast isnt that great, but is good for the price."
2,3rd ones a charm?,"I am on my 2nd one of these. The first one had two bad pixels and six gray spots. The Pixels show on dark screens and the spots showed on light colors. I did a return and the 2nd one has a bad pixel right in the center of the screen. I tried to deal with it but it just glares at me and mocks me every time I look at it on a dark background. Two defective ones in a row. I don't know if I should try a third or just try a different brand. Bad pixels and light bleed seems common on these. Good luck. Follow up. I return to Amazon and they informed me they would not ship a 2nd replacement as the problem may be more widespread and may need some review. I was told to return for a refund. I ordered a 22"" Samsung Syncmaster 2253LW from another site which came out to be the same price after rebate. Kind of glad it happened now as the new monitor is amazing in comparison ... lol. Guess things work out like that sometimes."
5,Fantastic Monitor,Loved this monitor so much I bought another one a week later and now have 2. The resolution is fantastic and I have no trouble with the viewing angle. These both come highly recommended for a great product at a good price.
3,Decent monitor,"Have had this monitor for about a week now. It is hands down better than my orginal Dell LCD. Now, on the other hand, the software that came with it is impossible, it will not load onto my windows xp. The website for company is useless. I cannot get the driver that is supposedly on the disc to download. Luckily my windows driver can handle the monitor, though at a bit lower setting than recommended. Be prepared, if you want support from the manufacturers website, you have to sign in. Since I am a new customer I had no sign in. Went to another page on their website and registered as a new customer (this was on their ""online store"" and then tried to use that login to get into support, did not work. Have tried and tried to access support on their homepage to no avail. Monitor is good, access to service is HORRIBLE. Though I guess that is better than Dell's service, they always try to sell you crap when you call them for service."
5,"Acer 22"" LCD Monitor","I did a lot of reading and reviews of this monitor including an extensive and informative comparison of it with a Westinghouse monitor of the same type and size. Then I came across a friend who had one and saw and used it on their computer. I based my purchase on what I read and saw. I have been very, very pleased with the sharpness, color and clarity of the Acer AL2216Wbd 22"" monitor. I was also pleased with how easy it was to set up. It centered and sized itself automatically with no manual adjustment necessary. The only thing better, I guess, would be a bigger one of the same quality."
5,wow,"Great monitor, shipped fast...no dead pixels....no problems with installation even on my dinosaur system. I did have to update to the newest video drivers to get the full resolution, but I do not consider that a problem with the monitor...just a fact of computer life."
5,Acer Monitor Purchase,This was one of the fastest deliveries after purchase that I've ever had. Wish they all could be that fast and efficient. Great Monitor!
4,Great monitor for the money,"I purchased this monitor when I started a new job and was issued a laptop. The laptop screen was nice enough (1280x800 resolution), but it was only 15"" and I was used to a dual-monitor setup. I picked one of these up and was very pleased with both the price and the performance. The screen is quite bright, and the images are very crisp. My only complaint is that it takes the monitor a few seconds to ""wake up"" after it goes into power-save mode. The computer wakes up quickly, but then it's 3-4 seconds later that I get an image on the monitor."
5,I;m delighted !!!,"I'm delighted with this monitor. It exceeds my expectations. I researched retail prices here in Southern California and actually looked at this monitor at various stores who quoted ""out the door"" prices from $50.00 to $95.00 higher than Amazon !! I received my Acer 22"" monitor promptly and found it very easy to install on my computer. I'm 81 years old with the beginning of macular degeneration and enjoy the LARGER, SHARPER resolution. I also enjoy having ""BLING !"" Buy one - You'll love it !!!"
3,pixel problems,"My goal is to get as much screen as possible, unfortunatly, acer's screen does not actually give you 22"" of screen. Basically, you are losing 1.5 inches of width due to the low max pixel resolution of this screen.By comparison, I have my 17 inch screen set to its max resolution is 1280 pixels wide, accross 13.25 inches or 96.6 pixels per inch. The 22inch acer is set to its max of 1680 pixels wide, accross 18.5 inches, or 90.8 pixels per inch. For the Acer to be comparable to every other screen out there it would need to have max resolution of 1790 pixels wide.If you are trying to get as much screen as possible, not just a bigger screen, be sure to check the max pixel resolution before you buy."
2,Pink & Blue Screen of Death,"This Monitor was great, at first. Unfortunately, after about a month and a half, the screen turned blue & pink. It was a weird effect, everything that displayed had a strange mesh of pink & blue pixels washing over it. Before that, nothing, it was a great monitor for basic use. Unfortunately I couldn't fix it, and returned it to Amazon for a full refund, which I was happy at how easy that was. I am going to get another monitor from amazon, just not sure what to get yet. Perhaps a samsung, But I can't see getting another acer, the quality is sub par. Also, when it was working, it had severe ghosting with any movies, or videos."
3,"Nice monitor, but doesn't quite cut it.","This is a good all around monitor for people that aren't into graphics, multimonitor, or color management. It doesn't show true colors very well. Perhaps this is an issue because it's one of their lower end models.. I'm not sure. But the blacks are blueish, the white is a little pink, everything is just dulled down.. Even after adjusting the settings on the monitor.It also has a stupid ACER Splash screen when you first turn it on. My LG monitor doesn't do that, and it shows colors true."
2,great price - crappy product,No wonder the price seems so wonderful on this monitor. In less than 4 months I already have 2 burned out pixels (or whatever they are). I had my original monitor for 5 years and 3 moves later it was working fine - just upgraded for size. What a mistake! This is junk - find another one!
3,Will do the job,"I'm not a monitor guru. This monitor does the job. I'd say it's a middle of the road monitor.I use it for coding, and it isn't bad."
1,No signal,"My only, but very serious, complaint about this monitor is that about once every few weeks when I turn it on, it displays ""No signal"" and is unresponsive. The only solution I've found at this point is to blindly put my computer into stand by and the start it back up again.If anyone has a solution to this, I've be very appreciative if you left a comment."
3,Monitor good but 3rd party Ritz and Amazon bad,I recently bought this monitor from amazon through 3rd party vendor Ritz. But i got the better price from the monitor in local store so i ask for price match but that did not work out and i tried to return the monitor without opening it within 3 days. But amazon and Ritz keep pointing to each other and finally Ritz told me that once bought LCD monitor can not be return. While they did not mention that while ordering. This was a very bad experience which i never expected when ordering on amazon.
3,Cheap and Big...Featureless but Problemless,"The swap between analog input and digital input is PAINFUL, I use this feature as a monitor swap between two PC's.if EITHER pc is off, i can NOT swap from analog to digital to get to the other one....this *(simply put) sucks.other then that...well... it's a monitor either it works and looks good or it doesn't. I would give it 4stars on color, but the analog/digital connection aggrevation caused me to bump it down. it is cheap...so I consider it the same way I consider a disposible contact lens...useful for now."
2,"Too Bright, not uniform: Acer 2216Wbd 22"" LCD Monitor","The monitor was too bright and gave me eye strain. I could not turn down the brightness enough. Even at zero brightness, the monitor is glaringly bright. Then I turned down the contrast but it makes the upper part of the screen too dark. I also tried reducing the RGB levels and then turned down the brightness, but the picture quality decreased. I was disappointed with the product and returned it. No problems with the refund at Amazon, they refunded the shipping charges also."
3,A few problems...,"""You get what you pay for"" is a line that many have applied to this monitor and I agree completely. One problem previously discussed is (are?) the light bands on the screen when viewing a letterbox movie. The second, more annoying, problem is the appearances of ""smudges"" scattered throughout text. The screen is clean and the smudges tend to move, so there's something wrong with the monitor. Since I can't afford a more expensive 22"" monitor, I'll keep this one; I'm only moderately disappointed and can live with the smudges."
4,A very good widescreen monitor for the price,"I had been using two 17"" Samsung monitors on my Vista machine, but after replacing one with the Acer AL2216Wbd and upgrading the graphics card to one with a digital output, I am very happy. I use the 22"" monitor as the primary and drag windows over to the 17"" for reference while working on the primary. Works quite nicely for me."
2,Poor backlight uniformity,"Bought this for a friend of mine. Both of us noticed poor off-axis backlighting. Sitting directly in front of it, the image is nice and solid, but viewing from even a few inches to either side and especially moving up/down, the picture dims noticeably. Don't know if this was defective unit or just poor design, but it's going back."
2,acerng,"When I view a file that includes color,eg. prices in a portfolio of stocks, the colors red snd green are so washed out that they are difficult to read. I regret the purchase."
1,Worked for a year and then...,"it turned green. I tried to fix it. Nothing. E-mailed Acer. Nothing. Called customer service, my favorite - outsourced to India, and I went through everything I had done already. Nothing. I was told I need to mail the monitor to Texas by way of Fed-Ex or UPS. This is no small feat, and believe me it's not cheap, given I live in rural Alaska. So I asked myself, is it worth not only the expense, but the fact that I will be out of a computer for weeks? Months? (No one could give me a time estimate.) So I will chalked it up to a really bad purchase, buy a new monitor and never buy another Acer product again."
3,There are better monitors,"I suppose time has now passed this 22 inch monitor by. I bought it as an inexpensive (it was for me when I bought it in November 2007) second monitor. My first monitor is the much pricier Gateway 22 inch monitor, the FPD2275W. I really should have ponied up the money for a second Gateway. The colors on the acer are dull, the stand is REALLY wobbly (I have to be very careful when I clean it). It has no features. On the other hand, what features do I really need in a monitor. Maybe I'm being harsh because I'm comparing it to the fantastic Gateway. Still, I'd look elsewhere."
4,Great Monitor For The Price,"Understand this first: at this price-point, you're not going to get a professional-quality monitor. So if you need a very high level of color quality, or extreme contrast ratios, you might do better to look elsewhere. For almost everyone else, though, this monitor can't be beat for the price. The image quality is excellent (especially with the DVI connection), the response time is good, and the dot pitch and screen area combine for a very sharp image. Color representation is good: blacks are just a bit washed out, but otherwise the whole palette is very vibrant. I like the widescreen monitor format, but it may bother some people who prefer the standard 4:3 format vs the 16X9.This monitor comes with both VGA and DVI inputs, but *does not* include any built-in USB ports or speakers. I don't consider this a drawback, but it may be a concern for other buyers, so be aware of this before ordering.If you are on a budget (even if you're not), I recommend this monitor very highly."
4,Very nice monitor for the price,"I bought the Acer 2216 to go with five other monitors that I use to trade stocks. My needs are pretty basic. I run streaming chars so there can't be any shadowing or image distortion.The monitor has a great image and the acceptable resolutions native resolution native to the monitor make it easy to fit a lot of material on the screen without distorting the image. This is important in order to match the monitors adjacent to this one. (I have one desktop spread out over the five monitors.Performance, color, image quality and the viewing angle are all great - what I wish was better was the adjustability of the height. Since this is a wide screen, the screen is a bit narrower than my 20"" adjacent to this it. I need to raise the monitor and there is not a way to do that.Overall - great monitor. If you are a gamer, trader or anyone who will be matching this with another monitor, consider two of these or a monitor with the same height as your other monitors."
2,Very dissapointed,"My monitor came with 2 big fat dead pixels right in the middle of the screen.Besides that, the stand is a cheap piece of plastic that can't be adjusted at all. I can't tilt my monitor forward or backward, nor can I move it up or down to suit my needs. I had to get a phone book to prop it up more than an inch off my desk.It's a nice big screen for a good price, but everything else about this purchase was a disappointment. I strongly recommend that you spend a little more to get a better quality monitor."
5,Great Monitor,Excellent product especially for the money. Has met or exceeded my expectations. Would purchase again.
2,Stuck Pixels and uneven backlighting,"I know that for the price paid for the item, that I shouldn't expect miracles, but seriously... 2 stuck pixels and the uneven backlighting on this monitor are completely crappy. It doesn't even produce that great an image over DVI. I have yet to get fed up and switch it to see if it works any better on an analog connection, so if I ever do it, I'll update my review.I have a viewsonic Q20wb which I use at work and it's flawless...beautiful backlighting for great black-level performance, no stuck pixels, and great color calibration.The Acer just doesn't live up to the hype... Spend 20-30 bucks more for something better."
5,Great deal!,"No dead pixels, crisp display, there is no reason to pay three times as much this is the real thing.Two Negatives:- The base doesn't offer much adjustment, only tilt, and then it seems like I might break it if I am not careful.- Switching between multiple inputs isn't as easy as it should be- if you jump between machines often and don't want to unhook each time you will be better off getting a monitor-switch even though this monitor has two inputs.I only wish my employer had monitors this nice, and I know they paid triple what I did for 19"" flat panels!"
2,Mixes suspense with disappointing plot,"Two stars for the fact the book kept me reading, kept me interested in what would happen to Jerry and his brother, kept me curious about Buck (Redclaw) and his motivations, about Win and Woody and TJ. But only two stars because so many questions are left unanswered. What becomes of Jerry and Peter after their summer? How does it change them? After all, this is written as a sort of memoir, with repetitive foreshadowing that bad things are going to happen because the narrator has already lived through them. Thus, little suspense in the conclusion--the adult narrator obviously survived the confrontation! Why is Buck doing as he does? Some clues are hinted at, but not satisfactorily explained. Like Jerry in his physical encounters with TJ, this book teases, but never really reaches a satisfactory climax."
3,Not In My Top Ten,"Like other reviewers, I also read this book because it was listed in Stephen King's Top Ten of 2005. The story does a good job of keeping you interested and wondering what's going to happen next. The ending, however, comes to such an abrupt halt that it made me mad that I couldn't put the book down for 2 days."
2,I Want My Money Back!,"This is not the worst book I've ever read but it's close...I think the thing that disappointed me the most is that it drew me in but didn't take me anywhere...lots of potential...but it just didn't pay off and the ending was ridiculous...like I said...not the worst...but there are lots of good books out there, so be careful of wasting your time or money on this one."
1,"Disappointing, annoying, wooden, stupid......","I gave it a star because I did read the whole thing. The characters were not well written, Jerry, our hero was ridiculous. Actions were outre and unexplained, and yet the ending was predictable and unsurprising. And they killed off the dog. I hate feeling I've wasted my time when a story is over."
4,Full menu of leadership tips,"If you've read many leadership books, you may find that this compendium of common wisdom is more of a survey course than an in-depth revelation. Dr. Karen Otazo offers a year's worth of three-or-four page essays featuring leadership ""truths."" Her appendix to these 52 entries suggests further reading on each topic. Otazo's advice ranges from known verities to practical guidance to the occasional gem. If you want useful reminders or a handy rundown for a new leader, getAbstract thinks these tips will do the job nicely."
5,52-Nugget Pick-Up,"The Truth About Being a Leader is a super-practical read which gives the reader 52 very grounded and practical tips on what makes a good leader a great leader. Karen hits the tough issues head on in truths such as ""You Can't Microwave Leadership Relationships"", ""Your Team Is Key To Your Success, So Vet Them Well"", and ""Delegation Is A Confidence Game"". If you want warmed-over leadership theory, pass on this book. However, if you want in-your-face, hard-hitting, leadership advice then this book is for you."
5,Holy Chihuahua!,"Actually, I'm not sure what kind of pooch Poncho is but he is without a doubt the greatest cartoon character since Calvin.This book is loaded with great writing, unique art and the funniest punchlines since Larson.Grab this collection -- it's a winner!"
5,Perfect Source for the Perfect Interview,"I used Winning the Interview Game extensively during my recent (and successful) job search. Its key points about preparation, practice, and 'day of interview' routine all are spot on. The book brings out a lot of intuitive and common sense points, but arranges them in a coherent and logical fashion that will resonate with almost anyone interviewing for a job or promotion. Bravo !!!"
4,Edmond is Brilliant,"Because of the sheer power of one of the plays contained within this book, I have given this collection 4 out of 5 possible stars.Edmond is amazingly stark and real, and offers a complete reversal in character, and the last scene seems like an epiphony. This play is easily my favorite, and I have seen it performed in London by Kenneth Branag, it was most astonishing and brilliant. I have not read or seen either of the two other plays contained within theis volume, but I will say that Edmond is definitely a great reason to buy this book."
5,Excellent Biblical Resource for Everyday Issues!,"The Handbook of Bible Application is an excellent resource for anyone looking for a biblical perspective on various issues including from abortion to zeal and everything in-between.The typical format for each issue consists of: 1)listing and definition of the issue, 2) a question concerning the issue (i.e. - how should Christians respond to laziness?), 3) key Bible verses concerning the issue, 4) a few key points for thought concerning the issue, and 5) a listing of related topics.The handbook is decidedly more of a life-application instead of a scholarly approach. However, the pastor preparing a sermon, the teacher preparing a lesson, or the believer or unbeliever searching for biblical answers can greatly benefit from the title!All in all, a highly recommended supplement to the Bible!"
4,WONDERFUL DOUBLE BIBLE,"THIS BIBLE IS PERFECT FOR THOSE WHO LIKE READING THE KING JAMES VERSION BUT ALSO WITH A MODERNVERSION, A SIDE BY SIDE APPLICATION.THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH MORE YOU CAN SAY ABOUT A BIBLE. THEY ALL HAVE ONE PURPOSE AND THIS ONESURELY HELPS AN INDIVIDUAL BECOME CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH OUR HERITAGE AND WITH THE MEANING OF LIFE.THE PRINTING COULD BE JUST A LITTLE BIT LARGER FOR ""LARGE PRINT"""
4,Good resource,"This is a nice and quick biblical resource for everyday subject matter. It wasn't quite as extensive as I had anticipated or hoped, but easier to tote around than an extensive concordance. I would recommend it."
1,Side effects,"After 7-10 days, I suffered an adverse side effect, which abated after I discontinued use."
5,Outstanding reference work,This is an outstanding reference for this period of the Pacific air war. It is not likely to be surpassed in the future as most of the veterans who were interviewed for it are now dead.
3,East Of Angel Town,"East Of Angel Town is a disapointment. I have been a fan of Peter Cincottis light jazz style for quite some time, but the tracks on this album all sound as if he is trying to appeal to a ""pop"" fan, rather than a jazz one. I always enjoy listening to Cincotti anytime, and this album is not an exception, but the material selected here is bland and not my cup of tea."
2,nothing special,In this CD Peter Cincotti starts to steer away from what he was noticed for - Jazz vocals. This CD is trying appeal to broader audience - nothing special.
2,East of Nowhereville,"Just dreadful! It was bound to happen. Every once and a while a really talented musician and performer makes the mistake of thinking that he is also a great composer. Harry Connick even went so far to produce a Broadway show based his ghastly original score and lyrics. Peter Cincotti has not erred quite so badly but his new album East of Angel Town is awful, so much so that his stellar piano playing and singing can't redeem it. It's the sort of nondescript, Euro-trash fusion jazz/pop music you'd expect to hear on an off-night at Birdland. Every song sounds like the last and surprisingly there are few opportunities for Cincotti to display his virtuoso command of the keyboard. Skip this one entirely and hope that Cincotti returns to standards next time out."
1,Wrong item shipped,"Not a big deal...but i ordered this CD and received a book ""Reveaving the Family tapestry"" addressed to another name with my mailing address.Stuff happens. For the $5 I paid it is just not worth resending the book."
1,I will never read this Author again!!!,"This would have been a good story if someone else had written it. I enjoyed Pottinger's first book, The Fourth Procedure. I did not like his second book, A Slow Burn, as much. His third book, The Last Nazi, I did not like at all. It seems that the Author is trying to cover popular issues and is running out of ideas. I struggled to finish it so that I could write this review. The general story line was sufficient, but that is all. Everything else just happens to fit together in a convenient manner. After reading this book, I now question if I really read and enjoyed the first book. It seems to me that he is a one hit wonder!"
5,Phenomenal,"Just started a new job with an hour commute distance. There were times, listening to this book, that I just wanted to keep driving, so I could find out what happened. It's the audio equivalent of a page turner. Pottinger keeps you guessing till the very end. There were even times when I said the same words the characters were saying because I was so into the story. The version I listened to was read by Jonathan Marosz and was unabridged. Marosz is a fantastic reader and I find myself listening to new authors just because the books are being read by him. If you like a twisting, turning, roller coaster intrigue that takes your guts with the story from start to finish, then The Last Nazi is for you."
2,Innacurate,"I started reading the first chapter to the book and couldn't get beyond the first few pages. I love suspense thrillers, but can't stand it when an author ""makes up"" tacticts as this author obviously did with the SWAT team entrance."
4,Stayed up all night,"Stayed up all night to finish this quick reading, fast-paced, suspense thriller. Enjoyed the story line, the characters and the scary plausability of its reality.Give it a try."
2,"Interesting plot, boring characters, blah.","The plot is quite intriguing, and kept me reading. But a good thriller has more than a good plot. It has interesting characters and great writing. This was just plot. The characters were not fleshed out. The writing was bland with no humor, no spark.A great thriller or mystery is more than plot. It teaches you something about a place, profession, time period... This author had lots of opportunity to give details about fertility treatments, about nazi hunting, about genetic engineering, about viruses, about the genetic makeup (homegeneity) of the Jewish people, about the nazi medical ""experiments"" in concentration camp. But all these topics were treated in a superficial way.Overall a disappointing read."
5,Great entertainment,"See synopsis above.I liked the storyline. I liked the premise. I liked the pace and the intensity. Pottinger has put together an intense thriller that will grab you by the gut and won't let loose until you get to the very satisfying end.The idea of biological/genetic terrorism comes to light, especially when it's written by Stan Pottinger.Nicely done.""There are rules for everyone else, and then there are rules for monsters""Highly recommended."
2,A Disappointment,"Stan Pottinger has all the right credentials to make up a good writer. With his legal background and fertile imagination, you might expect a great book in the making. But a page turner or fast read does not guarentee that a book will be good. In this case, I found the premise far-fetched and somewhat insulting to describe Jews as a race. Perhaps Mr. Pottengier needs some help with science and/or genetics here too."
4,hold on to your hats!,"and enjoy this book! not for the faint of heart!a quick paced thriller filled with deception and brutality.overall, a very fine book!i'm looking forward to reading more of S.P. books."
2,Disappointing,"The Last Nazi is a sometimes silly, often melodramatic, and not remotely believable tale of a hunt for an old Nazi. Adalwolf, who once assisted Dr. Mengele, is now in his seventies, and is attempting to create a doomsday virus. I'm not sure how this person would have been able to keep up with scientific development and have been able to get the resources to pull of such a thing, but why sweat the details since this author hasn't. There was not a whole lot to like about this novel, other than some suspense and plot turns, but it would not be enough to recommend reading this. I would stay away from the last Nazi.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
1,Disappointing,"This is the second book on Slavemaster John Robinson and pretty much an also ran after John Glatt's far Superior Internet Slavemaster. Ms. Wiltz appears to rely on Glatt's book for much of her information without giving any acknowledgements.I found her book tedious and unfocused, jumping around through the story and losing direction at the end. I would have expected Maurice Godwin to play a far more important role instead of being relegated to just a couple of pages of summing up Robinson at the end....This is definitely not the definitive book on one of the most fascinating serial killers in American crime history and I would advise reading Glatt's book for the real story."
1,not pleased,"The book was well described, but the shipping time was insane, it took forever. I will never buy another book this way."
2,Too much of too little,"I genuinely wanted to like this book, but I found the author attempted to cover too many topics in too little detail. Texts on general construction materials and methods contain greater depth and detail than this book, and yet are written for the same audience (builders and 2 yr. degreed designers). Especially thin is the discussion and illustration of reinforcement, and this to me is the most complicated and important aspect of concrete next to quality control. I found the chapters on concrete in my old construction technology text to be much more useful."
5,Yet another concept from the fertile mind of Michael Janich,"I've read a lot of Michael Janich's books, magazine articles, and watched a few of his videos over the past few years and I have to say he is really into the basic scientific principles of whatever he's talking about.I really appreciate his ability to break these principles of his subjects (CQB knife use and pistol shooting, throwing things...) down to the lowest common denominator. Anything you wish to throw has a balance point and his explanation of the simple physics involved as well as the slow-motion photography makes it look so easy a child could do it.Now that I've watched this video it's very easy for me to wrap my mind around the concept of throwing things for fun or for self-defense. Now all I've got to do is perfect my technique.If you are into this kind of thing you won't regret purchasing ""Making It Stick""."
3,Great tool in the 70s,"Hello,From the text, ""This book contains diurnal proportional logarithms and tables of diurnal planetary motion.""It is a handy set of tables if you are doing astrological charts manually. Does anyone still do charts by hand?I did just one printing of 2,000 copies back in 1975 and sold them at $1.00 list.This whole booklet was actually material for a larger project that I had abandoned when I got derailed with making astrological calendars (Celestial Influences, Pocket Astrologer, Celestial Guide, Astrologer's Datebook, and now iAstroDaily for iPhones).Actually, I'm amazed to see that vendors still list this (I didn't list it).Sincerely,Jim Maynard"
4,Good toy but overpriced,"Pretty decent toy! I don't think it's worth 25 bucks but priced at $6.50 on the clearence shelf at T****t, how could I resist? My son really enjoys the Sigma 6 collection. Again, for the quality, it is--as most toys are nowadays--quite overpriced. But on sale for a fraction it's a pretty good deal."
3,shipping too costly,Shipping more costly than the product. Returned. No refund from the company. Would not purchase again.
2,Not Impressed,"Skips too much with slightest of bump.Are you kidding me with that remote control, it's way too large.Controls are not very user friendly."
5,Work great!,"As described, delivered on time. No complaints. Will purchase from this retailer again. These cole jaws work great. The only negative is the set up time every time you want to switch jaws. If you can afford it buy a seperate chuck just for these jaws. Mine came with grey rubber bumpers and they seem to work fine although I would hesitate to turn the speed up too high.Update: I agree with others; the grey bumper split when tightened. The optional bumpers are the cure."
2,Not strong enough,"Every bowl I try to make on this ends up smashing on the floor, no matter how much I tighten it, and how careful I turn."
1,Not helpful practice for the MCAT CBT,"After taking the MCAT CBT, these practice tests were not reflective of the real test. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. It is more useful to buy the AAMC online practice exams."
3,use examkrackers,"I used kaplan for content review purposes, which was adequate. I didnt discover examkrackers until i was in the question drilling phase (or the ""gap-filling phase"" a few months prior to taking the real test). I would highly recomend sticking to examkracers for this type of practice as far as quality goes."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"I bought many prep books while studying for the MCAT. I found myself using this book the least. If you compare the practice tests with the real ones from past MCATs, you'll notice that they are completely different. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Get Examkrackers and well as old MCAT tests from the AAMC."
1,outdated,"The description and tactics of each race/class was just repeated. There is no detailed information on the individual mission beyond the basic. The list of MOBs are outdated. The description of items do not include any skills. They gave some excuse of not revealing too much information in the map section. The game has a interface that gives you all the nav points for every system. The game provides more information than the book. The reason I buy a game guide is so that I would have this type of information which it fails to deliver. There are a lot of web sites out there that do a better job of providing information for this game. If you still want to get it, I'll sell you mine. A waste of money."
1,Waste of a tree,"This book has dozens of incomplete and incorrect lists of the items found in the game. There isn't even a list for devices!!! There are no locations given for any of the MOBS, and the star maps are useless due to their incompleteness.This is a waste of a tree and shelf space. Don't make the mistake of buying this. There are dozens of web-sites with more complete lists and up-to-date information."
4,Good Product,"This phone works like a charm. Once you figure out which settings you need to set on it based on your VOIP provider, it works great. Just make sure you have a solid connection to your wifi source. Broadvoice provides good support of how to program the phone. I've had it for about a month now and I'm so glad I do have it. I'm thinking of dropping Verizon and not getting a cell phone. Granted there are no common programs on the phone, such as an alarm, calculator, etc, but it is so much cheaper in the long run to own this than pay for cell phone service. Love it!"
1,It really is that bad.,"It really is as bad as all those negative reviews. Standby time is about 20 hours. It can't seem to connect to some access points. If I set it to send inband DTMF, the 9 key doesn't work, but all the other keys work (I am using ulaw). http://m.yahoo.com doesn't work with the browser at all. Many web pages crash the phone. Very few web pages are usable--it isn't likely I'll be able to navigate the page to activate a hot spot's wireless. The phone has a mystery button on the side that isn't mentioned in the instruction manual--I don't care enough to investigate what it does. Amazon calls it a ""Speaker Phone"". It isn't a speaker phone. When calling the WIP330, it only rings about 50% of the time, even though it claims to be connected to the access point and registered with my PBX."
1,poor performances,"I bought this WIP330 phone because it was a Linksys... terrible mistake.- upgrading the firmware is a difficult operation (far from being a one click operation)- the phone battery is really poor- the microphone is very bad and people always ask me to repeat what I say unless you shout in the microphone- the phone regularly disconnect from the router, who knows why?- linksys support is not up to the standard (I got a replacement and it just is exactly the same, they told me that no quality issue was reported on this device so far).But : it looks nice, for sure !"
1,No support,"I JUST BOUGHT THE PHONE, AND SOME OPTIONS ARE MISSING IN IT. TRY TO CONTACT LINKSYS SUPPORT IS IMPOSSIBLE. AFTER DAYS WAITING I GOT THE EMAIL FROM THEN TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO RETURN THE PHONE TO THE SELLER.I SELECTED THIS PHONE BECAUSE IS LINKSYS...BIG MISTAKE"
3,Wrong Author?,"I think the author listed for this textbook is wrong. I hope I'm getting the one by Anderson, like it says on the item image, and not some random irrelevant one by Mikkelson."
1,poor quality,"Pictcher looks lovely but starts falling apart in about a month, all by itself, as it's mainly used as a decoration on my dinner table."
1,Where is Bette Midler's beautiful song?,"I would have bought the cd if the song Bette Midler sang had been on it. ""My One True Friend"" is a beautiful song."
5,The One True Thing Soundtrack Deserves 5 Stars,"I have listened to and bought this soundtrack and I love hearing all the ""music"" instead of all the other stuff you hear on other soundtracks. I am a big fan of classical music and this soundtrack has helped me realize why."
3,A pleasing sound track album,"I wanted to come to the defence of the Bette Midler song ""My One True Friend"". I think it is a beautiful song and it certainly brings out the chill bumps for me! The writers have a first class pedigree being Carole King, Carole Bayer Sager (who has written smashes with Burt Bacharach) and David Foster. This song definitely should have been on the soundtrack album."
3,Allie Cardoza,"Playing for Keeps!! I think playing for keeps was a good story but is wasnt my style at all.There is a girl her name Rose Ann she sixteen years old. Her gradmother Golry calls her and asks her if she can go on a caribbean cruise.She doesnt want to hurt her grandmothers feeling she she says that she will go with her.Then her grandmother tells her that they are going to play poker tornament.Then she see's a boy his name is Ricky Deiago he was also sixteen. Well they were hanging out for awhile.then they seen people following them around the boat .Grandmother Glory was following them around like a hawk. Then one day her grandmother approached then and said "" I hate to say this but we are playing them in 10 mins im sorry Rose"" well i cant tell you the end you will have to read it and FIND OUT!!Thid book is good but not for me!!!!"
3,Earlier Alwyn Crawshaw--good for marine painters,"This is an earlier book by British artist Alwyn Crawshaw. Mr. Crawshaw has the ability to take complex subjects and simplify them. In the case of boats and harbors, he shows how to do barges, boats, harbor details and water. Both watercolor and acrylic techniques are covered, though not in detail. As ever, Mr. Crawshaw is not a colorist--he is, rather, better at value and shape and perspective, as well as composition. If you want to learn what to see--what to draw, when you are painting a marine scene, this is a somewhat useful reference, but it's not one of Crawshaw's best books. As his career as a teacher and author progressed, his books improved greatly. This one is probably best if you are already a Crawshaw fan."
1,How the Earth Works-do not waste your money on,"I would not recommend buying this book. I purchased it to use for home schooling because it was recommended in The Well Trained Mind book. While visually appealing and fairly informative, the experiments and demonstrations are nothing but frustrating and usually do not work. I invested a lot of time and some money into the experiments and they simply did not work. I am educated and have no problem following directions, so I have to admit I do not think that was the problem. I can't get rid of my book fast enough. Good luck to you if you decide to use this book!"
1,Lack of Support for Failed Drives,"Lack of Support for Failed DrivesWestern Digital will not support your hard drive WHEN it fails. On November 16, 2004, I bought a 250GB hard drive. Three months later in February, 2005, I had to return it for a replacement due to a hard failure. Now, this replacement drive too has failed as well after only eight months.I went through two Western Digital drives in a year due to no fault of my own and the hard drive failed just six days after the warranty expiration. I requested a replacement from Western Digital and they completely ignored me.Buy at your own risk."
2,Lasted about 3 years,"Bought this drive back in 2003 because of a great rebate deal and the preformance of my old WD hard drive. Three years later after a couple power outages(note pc is plugged into surge protector)drive failed(read\write errors and 80% of data losted) was able to recover and move most of data drive lost with a seperate software. wrote zeros to drive and reformatted,drive worked for two more weeks before completely failing, now it is totally useless. Overall a decent drive with a short life span. make sure you have at least a 3 year warranty if purchasing this drive."
1,Staying away from this drive,"After all the bad reports from these reviews and the many customer reviews on the circuit city website http://www.circuitcity.com/rpsm/oid/71459/rpem/ccd/productDetailReview.do Many of which involve quotations like ""The drive started to spark"" or ""It simply caught on fire"" I think I'll just stay away from this drive."
1,Not for XP Systems!,"The side of the box stated it works for XP, however, it totally messed up my system and I had to restore my system."
1,written in and highlights throughout text,"For the amount that I paid for this book, I was disapointed as it is written in and has high light marks all through the book. Thsi should have been written in the sellers discription of the book. Not Happy."
4,A Much Anticipated Sequel,"I've read a lot of children's literature, being a fourth grade teacher. I read and enjoyed THE SECRET OF THE MEZUZAH a couple years ago, so I was very glad to learn that Mary Ann Bell's book was part of a trilogy. This second book features the same confident, adventurous Con, but this time in an American setting. The central plot and themes were not, to me, as meaningful as the first book, but I really enjoyed learning more about the adventures of Con and his interactions with his family in Wyoming. This book will be very appealing to kids who enjoy books about kids who are ""on their own"" (like the ever popular Box Car Children books) because Con and his cousins are staying on the ranch without their parents, with only the occasional supervision of their grandparents. The cousins have many adventures taking care of the cattle on the ranch, as well as trying to solve mysteries in town. I'm looking forward to the third book!"
1,This author is a liar,"I am really hurt by amazon.com for this book. If amazon doesn't apologize for its selling this book, I reserve the right to attack amazon.com with any means.This author, a cheating liar who receives money from the Japanese organizations, makes big money from his Japanese sponser for his anti-Chinese books."
1,every culture has its foundation.,"I really disagree with the conclusion reached by the author. The formation of a culture needs its proper foundation. When the media sometimes can accelerate this formation, it can not make it without any foundation.The hatred of the Chinese people to Japanese especially during the Japanese invasion of China was because they really suffered, not because of the propagenda. When you really had the experiences of running off the street in order to hide from the bombing of the Japanese planes, when you saw your neighbor, a family with 7 persons all gone over one night of the bombing, when your older sisters had to be dressed like boys to avoid the rape by the Japanese sodiers, there was really no need to let the media telling you that the Japanese were your enemies.Same with the success of the communist revolution."
1,"Jap animals will never regret, and forgiven","Japs, whatever you say, prepare you own propaganda, we will revenge for your criminal and aminal behaviors."
1,I don't know what kind of people Japanese are,"I just read a book written by a Japanese soldierwho participated in Nanking Massacre. He said hekilled many people and raped many girls and womenso that there were no virgins anymore from Shanghaito Nanking along the rail way. Japanese killedthose women after they raped them to erase evidence.Now, children of those killers are out denying theirancestors' crimes. I guess Japanese are heartless peoplewho cannot be saved. Only one day another country does the same to them then they will realize how cruel and barbaric are their crimes."
1,I cannot agree with the former comments,"It is really a disappointing review writen by a Japanese who cannot face the reality. I don't know what mean ""alleged atrocities of the Japanese Army"". That is a war on the land of China. It is so clear that the Japanese invasion cause the war. Compared with German, Japanese are so silly because they don't want to admit their atrocities and do something to change the views of Asian people."
2,A shameless nation called Japan,"Germans and Japanese both did horrible things, Germanssincerely apologized to Jewish people and made an anti-fascismlaw, and their premier even kelt down for forgiveness. Germans are still gentle men, they dare to face their atrocities.Surprisingly, Japanese killed so many civilians across Asia brutally during WWII, especially in China and Korea, their horrible crimes cannot be described by words. Yet they have kept denying using whatever excuses. Now this ""Hiromi"" even talk about who started the war to avoid what were perpetuated by Japanese army. I guess she will also say US started war in Pearl Habor because Japanese was forced to attack.If a nation cannot face its own horrible crimes, they are reduced to worms, why? because they do not have consciences and memory like worms.Yes, worms, you can keep bury your heads in sand, while Asian people's anger is exploding."
1,"History is written by people, not by some yahoos","It is the fact that Janpanese invaded China and murduered millions of Chinese people. China didn't start/want the war, but the Japs did. This is the fact. This is HISTORY. History is written by people, and it will not be altered by some yahoos who try to make a living in this country.Just because you say the Earth is square-shaped doesn't mean it is the truth. It is a shame of this book being published."
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There isn't a single bad track on this cd. If I had one bad thing to say about, its that there's not enough songs. I want more songs by Billy. Seriously, he's done a fantastic job with this CD and you won't be disappointed."
5,WOW! Highly Recommended CD!,"OK, Billy had me after the first song! I purchased this CD as a CDN Idol sentimentalist, but am now in complete awe at how amazing the entire CD is and how much I am enjoying it!Billy Klippert shows this incredible talent on every song of this CD. This is REAL, an amazing voice and incredible song writing skills throughout!Don't delay in buying this CD! You won't regret it!A+++++++++++++++"
5,Timmins Youth Singers.Com Reviews The Klippert!,"Canadian Idol Top 3 Finalist Billy Klippert is such a passionate and intelligent young man - bursting with creative energy and enthusiasm for the music he loves to sing -rock, rock and more rock. His debut CD, Billy Klippert, has been released to the Canadian market; however, international fans can readily purchase this fine recording right here on Amazon's Canadian site.I would strongly suggest that you purchase Billy's CD, if only to hear his wonderful rendition of Elton John's ""Levon."" However, the entire CD is excellent and is receiving enormous raves from critics and fans across the country and on numerous Internet message boards. Good work Billy and a special note of congratulations to Universal's Orange Record Label for having the vision and the foresight to recognize Billy's star power. Good call, guys!"
5,Where's Mom now that I need her?,My son just moved away from home the first time and he said when he got it he sat down and read it from cover to cover for 2 hours. It was a great help to him
2,Great book,"The book itself is great. I bought it for a friend because mine has been so helpful for me, but couldn't give it to him because when the book arrived it was nasty. There was dried food debris (I guess that's what it was) all over the book."
1,Don't Assume,"This book, although it contains the occasional helpful hint, makes the dangerous assumption that the College ""Mom"" only has an interest in her child's nutrition, laundry, and other areas of the ""female domain.""I am apalled that this book, and its companion, was written in the 21st century! In our household, it's Mom who has the tool kit, not dad. Furthermore, it is an outrage to assume that the financial planning is not something that should be jointly managed by both parents.Don't waste your money. It's trash."
3,"a GREAT BOOK, but I got a bad used copy","Bought this book as a gift for a young co-worker in her first apartment. For some reason the first aid section was missing, and replaced with a duplicated section of pages. Looks like a manufacturer's mistake. Living with it, as the rest of the book was more important to her."
4,Cooking at College,"My daughter went off to college thinking that she knew everything. She soon realized she did not and found that this book, a gift from her loving parents, went a long way to answering questions that she had about a lot of things. She has used it a lot and is now finishing her sophomore year."
4,Surviving away from Mom,"I bought this book for my grown daughter, she loves that it is ring bound & is thrilled to have it. She had one that got loaned & never returned."
2,not accurate,"So my girlfriend's mom gave her this book when she moved out. My girlfriend and I have found so many errors. Like no listing for certain ingredients, off cook times, and many, so many more. I did enjoy the extras, but anything to do with cooking we just don't believe."
5,I'm the Mom,"I ordered this book for my daughter for Christmas. She calls me for everything from 'how to' to 'what is'. I've looked through it briefly and it looks like a great item. She is living miles away for the first time. I think she's going to like it very much. There are pages to add comments, etc. I'm impressed."
2,A bit dated but has the right idea,"Easy recipes, stain removal, and first aid are certainly three areas of importance to a lot of people, not just those who recently left home, so the title does itself a disservice by limiting the audience unnecessarily. The book was initially published in 1983 and the recipes show it. They do not represent popular food choices of the 21st century, and an update is needed. For example, there is a Vienna Macaroni Delight recipe that actually uses Vienna sausages - they come in a can! (I often wonder who buys those things when I see them in the store.) There are also casseroles made with mushroom soup, and a Tangy Spam Loaf recipe. Like I said, the book needs a serious update.That said, if you like comfort food you may find these recipes helpful. And the stain removal hints and first aid guide could prove handy for those who are new to doing their own laundry and nursing themselves back to good health. 50 Ways to Leave Your Mother"
3,Ehh,It is an okay cook book. I was expecting more out of this purchase. Has a few good tips and recipes.
3,not that great..,"i was expecting a lot more from this book, however after skimming through it, i believe you can find most of the information online when you need. It's more of a summary, and therefore it's useful."
5,what a wonderful tool,"Get this book together with WHERE'S DAD NOW THAT I NEED HIM and your kid moving away from home will be all set - also a great gift for a young couple!A MUST HAVE in my opinion and the hints on substitutes when cooking as well as measurements are the best ever. I have used this book many many times. The recipes are easy to use and have clear instructions, the cleaning tips come in handy many times and there is so much more info in this book, it would be hard to tell you. I also like the ringbinder version much better than the paperback version. It lays flat and makes it much easier to use."
2,Big deficiencies,"The PC version of this programs tops out at 65100 names. If you use the detail field to record you citations from your sources you will lose them, and some other data from the sources when you create a GEDCOM."
5,Like She Knows Single,This book gave me a better look at what some single woman goes through to fit into society. I think that the characters displayed the true personality of everyday people. Knowing that everything does not happen in life the way that we sat out for it to be. Sometime there are problem in life that make us feel as though we are put on earth for peopple to make markery of. But realizing in the end that there is some one out here that love us the way that we are. God loves you no matter how great or small we are.Hope to see more book like this in the future from Ms. Hampton
5,Rupert Bear Annual 1955,My boyfriend flipped over this book. As a very young boy he was alsways sent Rupert books from his Aunt in England and always spoke about how he loved them. He was thrilled to get this one as a Christmas present now that he's 61 years old! It was received in perfect condition and he absolutely loved it.
5,Rupert Bear,"Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. Gave it to my 43 year old son in his Christmas stocking - he was almost brought to tears. So glad I found this on Amazon."
4,A Great Read,"I found this book to be great and a really enjoyable story. I actually had an audio version of the book. The writer did a very good job. The story is about The Captain's Daughters, Josie and Flora Walton though there are a lot of other interesting characters in the book as well. I love happy endings and I was not disappointed with this one."
1,Almost unlistenable.,"Like a lot of the other reviewers, I too am a huge Anita O'Day fan. She is a true original and, in her prime, jazz singing didn't get much better than Anita. This recording, however, is to be avoided. The arrangements are strong, and she is clearly trying her best, but she has no voice left and her timing is quite poor. Avoid this title (and, for that matter, ""Rules of the Road"" from 1993). Buy everything else, especially the Verve stuff. This one is for completists only."
2,A Bit Past Her Prime...,"This hurts to write. I LOVE Anita. She's got it all, or had it all. Though she's still got style her voice is pretty far gone. Its too bad there are no sound samples here because if you are familiar with Anita's vast body of excellent work, you might want to listen a bit before buying. (Visit http://www.anitaoday.com/homepage.html if you want to hear some sound samples from ""Indestructible"" and while you're there check out some of her amazing legacy as one of the greatest performers jazz has even known. )"
1,Oh Dear God - Why Did They Allow Her To Do This?,"Beyond the wonderful band and arrangements, this is one sick little recording of an artist WAY past her prime. It reminded me of a couple of boozed up singers on stage I've seen over the years in obscure jazz clubs around the country who are still trying to eek out a living any way they can. One of the few CD's I've ever bought where I actually prefer the vocalist remain quiet. She is SO off SO often that it's bizarre that it ever got released. She deserved better, bless her heart. Yet, for a brief moment during a couple numbers, I started to believe...."
5,Amazing!,"She's back! Every Anita O'Day fan must have this CD! It may be somewhat of a surprise for someone who hasn't heard much of Anita, or, those who have not heard her lately. As with all of Anita's tunes, the more you listen the better it becomes. She gives so much of herself.Most popular, and many so-called jazz singers, may have a good voice, however no style. When the voice changes with age there is nothing left. This is not true with Anita.This 86 year old genius really ""swings"", and is indeed Indestructible! It's priceless from a living legend! Oh, yes...the musicians backing her are superb!"
2,Euro Pro Model EP480,"Unfortunately I didn't have good results. I had a Black & Decker electric iron for more than 8 years. I saw the Euro Pro Model EP480 and I decided to buy it because my ""old"" iron was very old. My Euro Pro only lasted 1 1/2 years. For about two months I was having trouble with the automatic on/off switch, I had to move the iron many times in order to turn ""on"". Yesterday, while ironing, it started smelling like burn, it shot off and never turned ""on"" again. In order to finish ironing, I had to go back to the ""old"" Black & Decker. I feel that I wasted $60.49 (cost of the Euro-Pro Model EP480)."
3,Euro-Pro Shark customer service stinks,I bought this iron at Target and after a few months I am having problems with the iron. It leaks water and the water stains my clothes. I went to their website the only place to get some information to see how I can correct this problem or to contact this manufacturer and the site does not reconize the model number EP480. They don't a phone number where to call and now I don't where to get service since it's been a few months the store can't do nothing. I wasted $54.
2,ok but leaked at times and stopped working after 2yrs,the iron does a good job when it works properly. Leaks a bit at times.It suddenly stopped working after two years
1,Euro-Pro X Iron,"Total waste of money. Iron leaked water from the first time I tried to use it. Left stains on my clean clothes and had to re-wash what I had tried to iron. Followed directions the company gave to the letter and it still dumps!!!water no matter how long I let it warm up or how much water is in the tank or what water I use. Company stated if having a problem with leaking, use several tanks of tap water...I did and it still dumps staining water. The company will be happy to repair of course if, I pay the postage both ways, any needed parts, and, of course, the labor charge. Total all this and it will be more than what I initially invested in the iron. Obviously, I am not the only dissatisfied customer by the reviews on this site alone. What happened to standing behind your product, making and keeping a satisfied customer."
2,Euro-Pro Shark Professional Iron,"I liked the weight of this iron (too many are too light and do not get wrinkles out or iron a sharp crease) and I liked the padded handle. Especially I like the very long cord.However, the heat dial is under the handle and extremely difficult to see, and because the window for water level is blue, it too is difficult to see."
2,Nope,"Not wild about this iron. Bought it as an alternative to the Rowenta irons - didn't like how this one performed. I need a really good iron, no dripping, plenty of horizontal steam, and smoothly gliding soleplate for my sewing business. After going through this one and another Rowenta, that leaked like a sieve and left spots on my items, I went with a Hamilton Beach Stainless Steel iron for $26 from Walmart. Great iron."
5,NOW THAT'S AN IRON!!!,What an iron! I had a Black and Decker for years that broke and I replaced it with this one. It has been worth every penny. The wrinkles fall out of my clothes. The heat is distributed very evenly and moister is really easy to adjust as needed. The cord is extra long so I don't feel attached to the wall. It might look bulky but it is not. It is really light. Would recommend it to my mother.
1,Hot Towel Cabi,"Its been over a month now and i have still not received my product.I have asked for a tracking number to trace the parcel, but am told that there is no tracking number.I have paid for something which i have not received.Either i should get my product or get my money back."
4,"Great CD, for a soundtrack","I don't usually appreciate movie scores because they seldom contain the creativity put into other great instrumental compiliations, however this one ranks among the best I've heard. BTW, I don't know what it is you played when you were 19, but the song she is skating to near the end is Rachmaninoff's ""Rhapsody on a theme by Paganini."" The Tchaikovsky apears elsewhere in the movie."
3,mnfowler@hotmail.com,"There is also an instrumental during a skating sequence which I cannot identify except to guess it is Russian--Rachmaninoff, perhaps. Very sentimental in the best sense."
3,not bad as sondtracks go,"the song some people are looking for,the part with Katrina Witt skating is ""time to say goodbye"" by Sarah Brightman.you can find the song on her cd."
3,HELP MEEE!!,"Do you know the name of the song that is played before Katharina skates, when there are two clowns, or something like that on the ice????It's like a circus song...but I don't know its name or from where it is.. can you help me??thanks"
4,Russian Skating Melody,The music she is skating to near the end is part of Tchaikovsky's 'The Sleeping Beauty.' I played it when I was 19 at the Young Musician's Fesitval at the Hollywood bowl.
4,"It is good, I really like it",I really like the soundtrack and want to buy it. But I want to also want to know the opera or classical music that was played when as Katarina Witt skated in the rink. I want to know the artist and the song title. Can somebody help me out?
4,Russian Skating Melody,"If you want the exact song during the initial skating scene, it was sung by Andrea Bocelli from his ""Romanza"" album. First track titled ""Con Te Partiro"". I don't know who was the original composer but this is the exact song which Katarina Witt skated to. Wonderful song.....enjoy."
3,"Songs in the movie, not on the soundtrack","It drives me crazy when you hear a song in a movie, and expect the soundtrack to offer that song, but it isn't there! This CD is missing the duet between Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli that plays in the movie when Katarina Witt is skating. It can be found on Andrea Bocelli's CD, Sogno."
4,"Listen up, chuckleheads! The soundtrack by Elia Cmiral.","""Bocelli!"" ""Brightman!"" ""Bocelli!"" ""Brightman!"" It looks like the usual cohort of rocket scientists has failed to notice the presence of Elia Cmiral's *score* to the movie instead of the non-presence of a piece of *source* music that wasn't in any way germane to the plot of the movie. The song may have been meant to aspire to irony but may have been merely distracting.Cmiral's score, on the other hand, was concise, evocative and interesting. Why don't you give that a listen instead of seeking out the same old pablum?"
5,Really good!,"I looove the Replica books! This one, the second in its series, is just as good as all of the others that I've read. Amy, a clone, can't tell anyone what she is. This book clears up some mysteries from her past. Be sure to read the rest of the Replica books! (I've read 1-10, and all of them are great!)"
1,Hunk-a-Junk,"As my title suggests, this thing is a hunk of junk. After about five minutes of use, the shuttle hook became misaligned and the whole things stopped working. Unfortunately, it appears that there is no replacement for a real machine."
4,Suits my purpose,"I don't know what these people expected this tiny machine to do, keyword it's T-I-N-Y. Although, I had no problem with it what so ever. I just purchased it and have made completed 6 projects on it so far. My big machine died and I needed a replacement quickly. Of the projects I have made, all of different materials, not one problem arose. I have been sewing for a long time and would recommend this machine to anyone who wanted to start sewing. Of course it won't be useful for bigger projects, it's a mini machine. Taken for what it's worth I think this is a great product."
2,a book spielberg will love.,"there are actually 2 books here : Time Traders from 58and Galactic Derelict from 59 (sequal). both books are kind of infantile SF books, representing the clasic age of the ganre. it has a very entertaing plot with aleans back to the past, and the back to the feuture plot, and then flying in rockets to sidtant planet, meeting bad russians, and aleans, and monsters. in short a full plot of 5 spielberg movies in one cover -because the story is so plane, the figures are one dimentional, the americans are always the best and humane, while the russian and the aliens are always bad or stupied. and the writing style is not something to cover on it.andre norton won the SWFA grand master aword in 83. i think this was to show gratitude for his persistance, but judging from this books, i don't think he truely deserved it."
1,"Bad design, Deceptive concept","First of all this is not a REAL computer. It has a tiny screen and is very hard to read with all the loud colors around it. Its frustrating for younger kids, my three year old, as they to TYPE in a Game code and hit ENTER evertime they need to use it. Our older kid finds it too obselete, as it doesn't do stuff the ""real"" computer does. The error message is relentless and constantly tell your kid has made a mistake a thousand times. Its also a nightmare for parents as it requires parents to intervene often. Moreover the display is black and white and small. Reminds me of UNIX command line programming I used to do eons ago.Please stay away from this obselete design."
5,"Buy the best, Forget the rest","I've read a couple of the credit repair guides out there, but none come close to the level of detail and research which Dana Neal exposes in his book. His methods are tried and true and garnered from experience gained through repairing his own credit and working in the collection industry. This is a self-help book that has a plan you can follow. Get your hilighters, file folders, and credit reports ready for a battle with the corporate dead-heads that are trying to keep you paying high interest rates for the rest of your life!"
1,Not so great,"Entirely about how to contest things on your credit report.Not useful for a lot of people who just want, as the title suggests, the best credit."
2,Fantasy Land (Does not work),"I read this book and it is well written as well as fully understandable, however its not reality. I didnt owe alot but did have a credit impaired score. Not a single one of his tactics worked. I gave it a year. Haggled yelled followed up the chain to get things done the way he described but no dice. Haggled with one collector for 4 months with no result wound up paying most of it off with no removal from my credit, just paid. The only thing I can walk away with this book is to start paying your bills on time and get the suckers payed off wait the 7 years until you can forceably remove the blemishes."
2,Need better letters.,"The book left me not really knowing what to do overall. I have tried writing dispute letters myself and gotten denied repeatedly. [...] is a site ran by volunteer credit repair experts that offers credit dispute letters for credit inquires, late comments, collections, charge-offs, etc. They have examples on the website that show their letters work."
1,"No suspense, Little action. Not worth watching.","I like Miles O'Keeffe, but I know he's been in lots of bad films, but they're usually entertaining enough. This one also has Chris Mitchum and Timothy Bottoms in the cast list, and the story sounds good (a militia group tries to sabotage a space shuttle). Unfortfunately, the good premise is wasted in a boring script with absolutely no suspense and very - and I mean VERY - little action. The film has not one but two of the worst car chases I've seen (I admit the second one was shot in a great location; it's too bad they didn't use their location for something good). Also, none of the three mentioned ""name actors"" on the DVD cover is the actual star of the movie.Despite a nice cast list and a potentially good premise, ""Diamondbacks"" has nothing going for it. It's just boring. Not recommended."
1,Piece O Junk,This is the worst toy I have ever seen. I wish I read the reviews before I bought it. There should be either a recall or a class action lawsuit for putting this junk on the market. At first I was ticked that they advertised it could shoot 7 wheels and it only comes with 2 . The junk won't even shoot 2 let alone 7. I already threw out the box and the receipt. I'm sure the toy will be next.
3,Practice makes perfect,"My husband, son and I also had the same frustration over this toy as the previous 4 people who wrote the review the day after Christmas. But after giving the toy 2 days of practice it works and it works every time. It is sensitive to a few key things. Your child has to be sure that the loading clip is fully locked in. The hub has to be placed on the wheel so that when you pull on it it doesn't come off. There is a specific groove in the wheel that is has to go into. You have to consistently take the hubs out of the toy after they have been released from the wheel. After 5 launches the hubs have to be removed from the toy or else they will get in the way of the next wheel being launched. I think this toy is rated for kids ages 8 and up because you do have to be very precise in some of the steps. After much practice it is a fun toy and my son is enjoying it."
3,Entertains for a while,"After over a year of ownership, this product, like most toys, sits in a toy box ready for the next yard sale. 2 boys, ages 7 and 10 played with it for a couple of days and lost interest. Guess neither one wanted to be the one chasing after the wheel."
1,Worst product for 2005,"My son was so excited to get the rapid launcher for Christmas, however the poor design makes it impossible to launch one wheel much less 5 in rapid order. It looks great but a major flop on the fun scale"
1,Simply Sucks,Wheels wont load or launch. How did this thing make QA? Only thing son wanted from Santa and what a colosal POS!!!!!
1,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this toy. A lot of hype on TV which draws the kids in, but it does not deliver. The wheels only launch 50% of the time. The adults find it very hard to use also. I am going to work on the toy and fine tune it so my 4 year old can work it. We bought it on sale on with free shipping, so I don't feel as bad. Beware of this toy becasue it will disappoint your kids."
1,DO NOT BUY- piece of crap.,I think my son has managed to shoot just 2 wheels out of this thing in about two dozen tries. It jams and most of the time the wheels do not go down the shoot.This was a gift and of course we threw away the box. I will wait a couple of months till he forgets about it and throw it away too.
3,Launcher???,"I have to agree, this toy is very frustrating. We can get 3 out of 10 wheels to launch. If you pull the launcher too fast the wheel spins out of control and gets stuck. If you don't get the ""gear"" on the wheel correctly when you engage the wheel it will fall off. Santa brought this as well as the ramp for the wheels to jump. When it does work, it's pretty cool, but then again it doesn't work very often."
1,Dont buy!!!!,I used this tape to videograph a wedding and the quality of these dv tapes were very unreliable. I ended up with lines running across half of my video. Don't buy this these tapes if what you are taping is at all important!
2,very forgetable performance,"I gave this CD 2 stars and thats because i'm in a good mood. i gave it 1 star elsewhere. its a very forgettable performance, save for Thomas Stewart and Bohm who are both fine. Gywneth Jones is an appalling Senta with frank pitch problems which are very obvious to even a half trained music ear. Hermin Esser as Erik is no better.Trust me, there are far superior recordings of this fine introduction to Wagner. See me comments on the first reviewer for a list of good recordings for this opera."
2,POOR QUALITY VIDEO TAPING,QUALITY OF INFORMATION ALTOUGH QUITE INTERESTING AND USEFULL IT IS VERY LIMITED. ALMOST 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES ARE SHOWN. TOO MUCH REPETITION OF THE SAME TECHNIQUE IS SHOWN FROM THE SAME ANGLE OF SIGHT. PRESSURE POINTS ARE NOT SHOWN IN DETAIL. IT IS A POOR QUALITY VIDEO TAPING OF A SEMINAR HELD IN BELGIUM POLICE ACADEMY.
5,iron snake,Very cool tape shows real karate I would highly recommend this tape every serious martial artist should own this tape
5,more than satisfied,"This is the type of pan you'd expect to find in an expensive catalogue or a pricey home party. It is heavy weight, finished well, and generous lips for a better grasp with pot holders. I wish norpro made all the sizes of cookware and bakeware that I'm trying to replace to get rid of the teflon and aluminium pans from my kitchen as I wouldn't think twice about purchasing them."
1,pie pan not cake pan,I asked for this as a christmas gift and was very disapointed when i discovered the sides were slanted for pie making rather than cake baking! The description did not convey this information and returning it would have been a waste of time and money so now i am stuck with it. I guess i will have to find some use for it now and be a lot more cautious when making this type of purchase.
3,hard to get cake out in one piece,"Trying to avoid Teflon, I bought two of these to make sandwich cakes. They're fine...when you can get the cake out in one piece. But it's not easy. I've greased them thoroughly...sometimes give them time to cool, sometimes not...etc...often, it's impossible to get the cake out whole. And I don't want my tot's birthday cake to come out in bits, so now I""m going to have to find an alternative..."
4,very good purchase for the price,The cake pans are a good weight and size for the price paid. I have baked with them a few times and cakes turned out great! Stainless Steel is the only baking pans that I like to use.
3,"--= Heavy, melodic hardcore/punk =--","The reason these guys sound so good is because they are able to please fans of both melodic punk and heavy hardcore. The vocals are gruff, yet sung with precise harmony. And the music isn't too extreme; keeping a nice mid-pace. ""Never Never"" and ""Where Are We Now"" are terrific sing-along songs and will get stuck in your head for hours. A few tracks sound like they're gonna be live and start off with words for the crowd at the show, but then they transfer to a studio track. BTW Heaven forbid these guys take a right-wing stand ! I mean shouldn't every band out there be left-wing ?? Anyway, their political stance is hardly a point of concern here. If you want to firm up your underground music collection, add this piece and enjoy. - Jay in Texas"
5,Awesome video,I bought this video after I bought the Encyclopedia of Dim Mak and I thought it was great. It shows actual applications and the application of remmedies for a few(an important few I might add)Dim Mak points.one-word description-AWESOME!!!
5,secrets of dim mak,I purchased an NTSC copy of this video from Erle Montaigue in the mid ninties obviously to use it in australia i had to convert it to pal which i did. the quality was what you would expect from a vhs compact camera or 8 mm which was the standard of the time{not everyone could afford betacam sp} on an academic level erle certainly knows what he is talking about. his ability to explain in both a scientific and spiritual way the art and application of dim mak is excellent. i also have his encyclopedias and other books . if you are genuinly interested in dim mak this is a must video for your collection . learn more about erle at ... congratulations ERLE MONTAIGUE
2,"TOO BIG, TOO HEAVY","This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky. If you have a place to set it up and leave it, fine, but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the TV', as described. Performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment, but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use. I'm disappointed."
2,May be great for hardwood floors but ---,"When I read all the wonderful reviews for the Sh-Mop, I decided to give it a try. Well it may be the greatest thing since sliced bread for hardwood floors, but when it comes to mopping a large kitchen in a country home with men and pets, give me an old-fashioned bucket and mop any day. I really don't see how constantly wetting cloth covers, wringing them out and applying cleaner saves time. Plus you have to wash the terrycloth covers, SEPARATELY, since you would never want to wash the filthy things with anything else. I will admit the product is great for washing walls though, so I will keep the Sh-Mop, but to be honest, I don't think this product is any kind of a time-saver when it comes to kitchen floors."
4,As advertised,"This has been working well for us since we got it for our laminate floor. I love the name. I did not read carefully when I bought this item as I was wanting to get something with microfiber, but that is my fault. No problems with the handle."
5,I Love This!!,"As someone with a dog and 2 kids who just put their house on the market, this has been a life saver. Mopping floors is easy and quick, no longer a chore. My floors always look great and it is so simple. Highly recommend!"
3,ok sub,i have a set of these in a smaller sealed box in my 04 grand prix and they are being powered by a 1200w sony amp they hit hard but thing is i was bumping them the other day and happen to blow the surround away from the cone working on a band aid fix for it right now will see how it goes
2,"Last night CD, but not the dance mixe! :(","I order this CD single thinking it had the Last Night dance mix, but it only had the Tell Me dance mix which I already had a better mix of Tell Me. This CD only came with the original version of Last Night and I have P. Diddy CD ""Press Play"". Not very happy about that...."
5,none better.,I saw this group in concert...my ears bled. Not really but close to it. They put on an awesome show and their music is a pure adrenalin rush.
5,Beautiful,"This book and its companion, published by Chess Stars and available at gmchess.com, present the entire collection of Lasker's games, over a period of 43 years. No player ever has maintained such a high level oif play over such a long period, except perhaps Korchnoi, but it is unlikely that he ever reached Lasker's level, at least when compared to his peers. Lasker's games are endlessly fascinating. You can see him play Steinitz, Alekhine, and Botvinnik; the King's Gambit and the King's Indian. He was there for a lot of history. He was a tenacious fighter, at every stage of the game. These books are amazing games collections to have. All fo the games are annotaed, some heavily, in Informator style. I am very gald that I have these books."
5,"Made In Sheffield, indeed!","Beautiful collection of gems from this essential, but nearly overlooked post-punk outfit. Highly recommended for fans of seminal noise from this period."
2,Pearl is a brat.,"My four-year-old daughter received this book as a gift. The illustrations are nice and the stories are all right, but Pearl's behaviour and attitude are everything I'm trying to teach my daughter not to do/say: taunting her younger brother, calling things ""boring"" or ""junk"", crying because your friends choose to do something other than play with you....is this supposed to be cute?We'll stick with books that don't glorify bratty behaviour."
3,ufff sarit learn how to sing!!!,"Sarit Hadad is probably one of the best known israeli exports right now. she has a huge following in israel and abroad. granted, some of her songs are very catchy. but she ruins everything with that terrible voice of hers and all the off-tune singing. from lyrics and musical perspective most of the songs on this album are ok. it's her presentation that sucks. she just doesn't know how to sing."
4,excellent!,"Having just readPersonal Best - How Ordinary People Achieve Extraordinary Success and How You Can Too,I was keen to read this book to keep the momentum going . I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by John P. Kotter is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed this book If you don't know how to lead change, then reading all of the other management books won't do you any good. This should be the first book you commit to memory prior to launching into any new initiative, re-engineering, balanced scorecard process, or even the smallest changes to your organization.I highly recommend this book."
4,Great step by step plan,"The steps the author outlines, listed by another review so I won't go into them here in detail, are simple yet necessary. It's incredible that as I read through just the first one that details how management needs to be honest with employees regarding what needs to change and why I saw how a former employer failed to follow that first step and ended up always asking why no one would get behind change initiatives. The author seems to work a little hard at putting out examples of how each principle applies, and I don't think there needs to be so much evidence given, but overall a good reference."
4,Knowledge is Power - Change is Constant,"Since time stands still for no one the relevance of the information in this book will likely continue to decline. That does not mean that it has little to offer. All history is of value no matter how dated. The value of what this author has assembled is how companies react to change. It is the process that we learn from not the fact that they moved from one technology to the next. Since high school I saw the move from slide rules to calculators to embedded math within various devices (PC's, tablets, smart phones) which shifted my effort from knowing how to manipulate to knowing how to apply. I recommend this as a starting point for someone interested in understanding change or wanting to work within the Change Management or Project Management profession."
2,Naive,"Primitive cartoon type characters participate in outdated and hardly realistic scenarios.If you set all that within florid, but tiresome language environment you get the feel.One thing is pointed right, however: managers are seldom leaders;correction facilities do not inspire creativity.If you consider this review subjective - it is. Feel free to develop your own opinion.Thank you for your time."
2,too dry,"ALthough I was highly motivated to listen to the text for a graduate course while driving -a multi task attempt-it was hypnotic and almost put me to sleep. It was sooooo boring, it required herculean effort to focus and listen to it."
4,Very Helpful,I would recommend this book to any manager who is currently leading an organizational change effort. It's very practical. Kotter's Eight Steps are easy to follow.
5,A Key Resource for Any Change Leader,"The author opens this book with a discussion of the common errors people make in trying to implement organizational change. He then goes on to counteract those errors with his eight-stage process for implementing effective and sustainable change: 1) Establishing a sense of urgency; 2) Creating the guiding coalition; 3) Developing a vision and strategy; 4) Communicating the change vision; 5) Empowering a broad base of people to take action; 6) Generating short-term wins; 7) Consolidating gains and producing even more change; and 8) Institutionalizing new approaches into the culture. The first four stages are intended to defrost a hardened status quo, the next three introduce many new practices, and the final stage grounds the changes into the corporate culture and helps them stick. This book is a comprehensive approach to change management and highly recommended for anyone undertaking a major change effort within an organization."
2,Long day's journey into boredom,"If you enjoy reading laundry lists, this is for you. I bought the audio version to listen to while communting, finally gave up in self-defense -- I was falling asleep at the wheel. Problems with this are: lack of real-life examples; pedantic, didactic style.For better and more readable/listenable advice on implementing change, check out: ""Good to Great"" by Jim Collins; ""Execution"" by Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan; ""Who Says Elephants Can't Dance"" by Lou Gerstner; ""Winning"" by Jack Welch."
4,Good Read,It has good advise on the subject.Recommended reading for those whom want to be great managers.A must read.
4,Real nice book,Real nice book with good analysis about leading change in an organization. Brought in the differences between managing and leading change.
4,Progress is Leading Change,Have not finished reading but is very interesting. Keeps you focused. A book you do not want to put down. This was for a religious class at Purpose Institute.
2,"Different book, same story","I own almost all of Kotter's books, and for the most part agree with his business philosophy. I was required to purchase this book for a class, and was pretty disappointed to find out that it is almost identical to ""A sense of urgency"" and ""The heart of change"". If you already own these books, save yourself the money and don't purchase ""Leading Change""."
5,Leading Change by John P. Kotter,The book is terrific if you really intend to move your organization forward through change. The insights proferred by the author are exceptionally pertinent to today's global changes. Provided in the book are step-by-step processes to achieve success as well as pitfalls to avoid. The eight primary mistakes of leading changes are clearly identified and relevant discussions are presented in a clear and concise manner. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to accompish change with the least amount of pain to their employees and with the most guarantee of success. Outstanding.
4,Excellent common sense approaches to change.,Kotter's book on leading change is elegant in the use of language and examples that demonstrate the techniques he uses to insure success with change in organizations. He identifies why change strategies often fail. Some of his examples may seem trite to seasoned managers but overall the advice is solid.
5,A must book for anyone leading organizational change,I would rearely take the time to complete one of these on-line reviews -- but Kotter's book demands it. Anyone in a leadership position today should have this book and continually work through it until the pages are dogeared and worn. Must read for strong leaders.
3,Hmmm...,"This is a great book if your leadership style involves beatings until morale improves. Really tired of pompous executives who think like this author. Funny thing is, if anything happened to them like they think should be done to other people they'd probably implode. Kotter has some parts right in the book in terms of getting the right people in the right jobs, but the method of doing so leaves something to be desired."
4,Leading Change,Great book with a different twist on change. I've been involved with change efforts in the past and these principles make sense to me.
2,Leading a Procedural Guide,"Although this book does have pertinent and decent information, the author has no charisma, and I found myself wanting to stop the booking only two chapters in. Yes, the information is useful, but it is presented in a manner which makes it as painful as pulling teeth."
1,not long lasting,"I bought this iron and am not very happy with it. It worked fine for a few months, and then nothing. I thought it might be the plug, but I tried everywich way to plug it in various outlets. No power. It was only 7 months old.I also bought a euro pro sewing machine and it only lasted for 10 months. I will never buy euro pro products again, thank you."
3,So far so good...,"... I have only owned the iron for 2 months, so I haven't had the problem the other reviewers had... yet. So far, the iron works well. Nice and solid, not too heavy, but substantial enought to give a nice crease to anything. It's a little clunky when you're trying to put it back into its warming base, if you are using it as a cordless iron. If you don't care about the cordless aspect of this iron, however (which was the reason I bought it), look elsewhere. It's a little less streamlined than other irons, when you use it as a corded iron. However, if all you do is a little light ironing and you want the ease of a cordless iron, then you'll be pretty happy with this one."
1,Don't buy...,"The first week was great, all down hill from there. The iron leaks uncontrollable, it's not sturdy, w/o steam it's impossible to get of wrinkles out of anything except polyester clothing. Cotton items, forget it. I recommend to NOT buy this item. Target should remove this from its inventory."
3,OH NO Birdhouse opening to small for birds ?,I have yet to see any birds go into this condo....it is very decorative and well made though.Perhaps the holes can be enlarged a little and birds would enter.It was diffcult to attach and ended up having to tie it around a tree branch on its pole.
3,It's not a birdhouse,"My daughter found this and bought it with her allowance because she wanted a bird house to watch birds. But it isn't a birdhouse. It is country kitsch. The holes are no where near large enough for birds to get in and there is no place to open it up and clean. It looks exactly as pictured, but decorative only.I have one disappointed little girl."
3,Cute but not very functional.,"This shoe is cute, but I found it a bit stiff and clunky. Not for prolonged walking or standing."
2,"Japanese Wood Dolls, Kokeshi","I was expecting much more information on these Japanese kokeshi than was offered in this book. It offered lots of white space. It did not cover the many different styles made in northern Japan, it did not cover the Masters, the National Treasures, it did not mention where and in what region or town the kokeshi were made. It did not picture the many different designs and shapes through the years, nor the classic art on the very expensive dolls. I have bought over 100 kokeshi of various designs and shapes, and found the artists making these in their homes, which made collecting them so worth while. I was disappointed that this book could have been so much more, but cheated the reader on what the kokeshi really means to Japan and what a joy it is to discover what is available."
2,Save your money!,I found this video just short of worthless. It gives you a basic idea of some of the moves in Pentjak Silat but nothing more.
2,one major flaw,"At first this looked like a great purchase. The retractable cord saved on clutter in the car and I could easily remove the cord from the charger and connect it to my computer at work. Seemed like a very innovative design.However... after about one week of casual use the cord started pulling out of the base where it connects to the ipod. The sound/power hasn't started cutting out yet, but I can already see exposed wires. I guess the retractable mechanism pulls a little too hard on the cord. Perhaps I got a bum unit, but I'm going to return mine for another type of charger which can stand up to more than a week's worth of use."
1,Introduces Noise,"I like the compact size and dual role for the chargers cord, but when the Ipod's battery is not fully charged while playing via the I-Tunes module, a very noticable whine or wissle is generated by the charger. It works well when the charging current is not required during play (it's just keeping the battery topped off), or if you are just charging and not listening to your Ipod, but if you want to do both at the same time forget about it with this charger."
1,Too noisy to be usable,When connected to my truck's power outlet a high pitched whine that is very loud makes my mini iPod unusable. I know I can install filtering to correct this but I have used car power adapters with other audio equipment in my truck without any noise at all.
1,be careful with this one,"I don't know if mine was defective or if I missed something in the packaging, but When I plugged my iPod Mini into this adapter, it fried it.The screen turned brown, and it would not power up.I returned it to Amazon for a refund.According to the packaging, the unit is supposed to contain a safety fuse that would prevent this from happening.Mine did not contain a fuse, either installed in the plug, or in the package.If yours does NOT have a fuse, return it."
1,"Didn't work, need to return it. too hot to touch in charger","This appears to be a great item. I like the retractable cord very much, but it did not work and heated up so it was too hot to touch. We will see how the next one works."
4,Charges the Ipod...With tolerable static...Nice roll-up wires,"I can say that this item gets its job done - it charges the Ipod while you're in your car...but with a tolerable static sound if you're charging while playing some music. (which I think all car chargers for Ipod has this static present) What I just do is to minimize the volume of the Ipod to around 40-50% and adjust the radio's volume to lessen the static sound. Its roll-up wires are quite nice and strong...considering some said they break easily...probably because they pulled wrongly - only from one side of the roller, when the proper manner is to pull from both sides of the roller, so it will also retract from both sides. I can say I'm satisfied with the charger considering its usefullness and price. Peace!"
4,"Good product, not a bad price...","Almost right after receiver my Kensington Auto Charger for my iPod Mini, I took an across state car trip. I used the Auto Charger on the way down and back. NO sound interference and works great at charging. It seems that it doesnt even take as long to fully charge my iPod as it does with the wall charger that came with it. The only reason that this product didnt receive five stars from me is because i dont believe that there was enough effort put into developing the retractable cord. Both ends must be retracted at the same time, you cant just retract the end that the iPod's on, you must retract both. Another problem with that cord is that because you cant retract one side at a time, the chances that it will tangle are improvement. Other than that...great product!"
4,ipod auto,it works well due to it being easy to install and play the ipod I would recommed it for people on the go and who don't have cd players in their car
2,JUNK!,"This worked reasonably well for 5 1/2 months and broke. Like another reviewer stated, my charger has the indicator light on, but NOTHING is happening. What a rip off. BEWARE!"
1,not the best choice,"'retractable' cord doesn't work, so you are left with a long flimsy cord with a big useless hunk of plastic in the center of it. The device creates a high pitched buzzing noise whenever you try to charge the ipod and play music at the same time. There are other models of iPod car chargers, I imagine *any* of them will function better than this one does."
1,"Fine, just too small.","I wasn't sure if these would be too small for breakfast juice glasses, but they were. I gave them to my niece for votive candles for her upcoming wedding."
3,Women's Timex Indiglo Expandible Band Watch,"I ordered this item over a year ago after needing a new dress watch. The crystals are beautiful with my wedding ring; however, one fell out. I'll attempt to send it back to get a replacement. My wrist is petite so it was very hard finding a band that fits. While this watch swings around my wrist, it is a beutiful style. The Indiglo works well but goes out from time to time."
1,Arrived broken,Couldn't tell you if anything about this product is good since I never got a chance to use it as it arrived not functioning. The lcd panel just lit up a bunch of symbols that made no sense and could not be fixed after reading all the instructions numerous times. Would not order again after reading all the other reviews.
2,Less than what was hoped for,I am disappointed in this product probably because I had expected more. I find it limited for my needs and a bit more complicated than what my simple mind wants to deal with while I'm in the process of preparing and cooking.
4,Food Scale Review,Almost everthing is good about the product. I sometime think that the display could have been more clearer.
4,Great food scale,"This is a great scale! The only problem is getting it to clear so I can put another food on it. sometimes I just have to turn it off then back on. Otherwise, I love it!"
3,It's fine if you eat the typical American diet,"I bought this for my daughter, who is trying to lose weight. It's hard to see the scale under your plate, unless you use a very small one.If portion control is high on your list of priorities then this is the scale for you. It works well for a typical American diet but if you eat ethnic foods, you are bound to be stumped when entering a code for a food that's not there. I decided to keep the scale and use it for measuring exact amounts for baking since my daughter won't use it. For this it works GREAT."
5,Good Doggie (book),"Information packed book for the younger reader that really teaches something about dogs. For example the page on puppies says, ""A female dog usually has between two and ten puppies in a litter. Puppies are born with their eyes and ears shut."" The book layout is clean, fun, and colorful. Has an extensive glossary and index. Words in the glossary are in bold font. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
4,Consider the Source,"It's completely unfair to judge this CD by listening to a couple of samples or by comparing it to a live show. This is a studio album and should be judged as such. True it is not quite up to the standard set by Return of a Legend but never the less it has some fine moments and is a worthy follow up. Forget the two negative reviews or take them with a large grain of salt. Every one that I have played this CD for has really enjoyed it, in fact it is one of the more popular CDs that I play on my web radio station. In my opinion its well worth the money!"
3,Could'a been a 'five':,"""Too many cooks..."" I've seen this guy live, and he's got a hard-driving, hard-swinging band! Why are they reduced to an after-thought among a bunch of lead-foot supposed ""session"" players?....Amateur writers are truthful writers; the blues press live in fear of losing advertising dollars; try and find a bad review in a blues magazine: 4 stars is big criticism! Check the credits, there is simply no reason to substitute band members with guys who don't know the material."
2,Bad Guys Die,"I liked some technical aspect of this book, but as for stroy it is very contrived, it is like author constantly asking himself what else can go wrong so I put it in this book. The most disappionting part of this book it is its ending, where all the good guys live another day but the bad guys die no matter what they do to redeem themself. John did you really have to kill the doctor ?"
1,BE WARNED! This is a Motion Comic,"Word or warning, this is a motion comic, not an animated movie. It collects issues 7-12 of some Street FIghter comic series (in tiny print on the back cover bottom). This should be marked better or in books, not as an anime film.On the plus, the comics have great artwork. Just was excited for a new SF anime and got this instead at an overpriced $15 no less."
1,EMI Copy Controlled!,"Buyer Beaware! This is an EMI Copy Controlled CD. You can not copy it for legitimate use; Backup, Use in a hot car, etc. In addition, forget about ripping MP3 files or MP4 files for use in your iPods. Send A Message to EMI. I unfortunately purchased the CD since there was no indication that this was a Copy Controlled CD on this page. I hope EMI and SONY understand that there was music before there was an emi or a sony and there will be music long after they fold."
3,Too Many Issues Even for Burke,"CADILLAC JUKEBOX by James Lee Burke is the 9th in the Dave Robicheaux series and the various threads of the story are confusing to say the least. His use of language is as always of the finest literary quality which will keep you reading to the last page. But you might be advised to keep a list of what is happening to whom when to keep the story thread in mind.Aaron Crown goes to prison for an old crime he may not have committed. Dave is offered advancements to keep him from looking into the old murder of a Civil Rights leader.Best advice with this series is read them in order to keep track of personal developments in Dave's life.As always Burke is an excellent crime fiction read.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
3,Another disappointment,"For the third straight time, Burke ruins a pretty decent book by miraculously and quickly tying up all the loose story ends in the last 30 pages and not very well. This is the third straight book he's done this. Most of the book wasn't bad but it appears Burke is getting into a very lazy habit of building an overly complex story with too many characters and just throwing crap together at the end to finish. Time to take a break from Burke I think."
5,"HE'S A MAGIC MAN, MAMA!","I am madly, deeply in lust/love with Dave Robicheaux AND James Lee Burke. I've lived in the enchanting state of Louisiana my entire life and Burke makes me fall in love with it all over again each time I read one of his novels set here. He's a word magician and that's putting it mildly. For instance:""Each morning after the sun rose out of the swamp and burned the fog away, the sky would harden to such a deep heart-wrenching blue that you felt you could reach up and fill your hand with it like bolls of stained cotton. The air was dry and cool, too, and the dust along the dirt road by the bayou seemed to rise into golden columns of smoke and light through the canopy of oaks overhead. .""Hell, that's almost poetry! And he ain't just all purty words either! The plots are intriguing and compelling. I've read all of his books and feel totally lost when I've finished the latest Dave Robicheaux adventure. Keep 'em coming Mr. Burke!"
2,"Half-Way Through, He Just Lost Me","I've heard such good things about Burke, so I was pretty enthusiastic about reading Cadillac Jukebox. But for all my enthusiasm, this book just didn't do it for me.Burke's natural writing talent is obvious, and he grabbed my attention right away. The characters are all very human and real, it's a great setting, and things click along at a brisk pace. I found myself zipping my way through this book eagerly awaiting the next surprise.And then, about halfway through the book I just got lost. A thousand different things had happened to Dave Robicheaux, his cohorts, and his enemies, and though each scene was written well, it just wasn't coming together as a whole. I realized that I either didn't know enough because I hadn't read any of the previous books, or Burke was just all over the place.Over all a disappointment, but since this is my first Burke book, I plan to give him another chance by reading the first of the Dave Robicheaux series."
3,Jargon Jungle,"Interesting book, but there was SO much jargon -- cop talk, drug slang, and cajun words, that some of the time I didn't even know what they were talking about. The book should provide the reader with a glossary of terms."
4,Pirates fun!,"My boys love Timmy Time because it is a different show than the typical animated cartoons they watch. Timmy and his friends are also mischievous and fun! In this DVD Timmy and the gang pretend to be pirates and my boys couldn't have been happier! It is a cute show with lessons of friendship, working together, and using your imagination!"
3,Wrong color,"I can't believe that they would make something that is going to be mounted on top of the dash, and have a pollished aluminum finish. It reflects on to the windshield. It should have been flat black. That is exactly what I did, painted it flat black. Also I would like to mention that the 8 point compass is useless. It takes so long to pick up headings that by the time it does you are already on a new heading. So far it seems to pick up radar ok. I have not run into laser yet."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"I was so sure I found the Jellies of my childhood, but I was so disappointed the taste was off. I ended up tossing them after family members thought the fruit slices has an off flavor."
4,A Greenday Copy............With Style!,"When my mate first told me about this album i was very anxious to get a closr look at it,so after seeing a few reviews in various magazines,i decided to buy it.Once i got home i ran to my room and switched it on.As 'Catching On' Started i decided the tune was definitley the ska/punk i like,but when the vocals came in i thought i had picked up a Greenday CD by accident!.Dont get me wrong,i love greenday and Billy Joe's voice is superb,but i was looking for a newer,more punker kinda voice.But after listening to this whole record,i was very pleased with my buy.Dynamite Boy may be a Greenday copy,But they dont half do it well."
3,Love my iron,"I loved my iron and used it for about 6 months, using it mostly in my sewing room for pressing my quilt pieces. Then one day when I went to use it, it would no heat or turn on. I did not save my box and can not find my manual. So from loving it, I now have an iron that I can not use. Wish I knew where I could get it fixed."
1,What a hype!,"I bought this machine with great expectations,but was sadly deceived. First, it needed distilled water faster than my steam iron did, second, after using it for about 2 months, the handle that you hold kept getting hotter and hotter, until you couldn't hold on to it anymore.I sent the unit back to the company, which is not an easy thing to do because they have no phone listed for this company(I googled to no avail) and have not heard one word from them in over 2 months. I'm going back to my steam iron with a spray bottle for better results. hope this makes you trhink twice."
1,Great until it died!,I loved this iron for the first six months. More than enough steam to iron the most wrinkled cotton shirt with no effort. Until that is it simply stopped working after six months - everything works except it no longer heats.
1,Europe Pro Steam Station - a Rip-off,"We bought this iron twice !! Our first one worked great - till 6 months later. Coulnd't mail it off for warranty repair - because we didn't have a receipt. So...we bought another one. Well, the second one didn't even last 6 months. It was great steamwise till one day it just stopped heating. Send it in for repair - never heard back from the company. So, we kept calling, finally were told - iron was unrepairable. They couldn't replace it because they had none !! Sounds like a scam !! Customer rep was impolite and had an attitude. I would advise potential buyers to stay away from EUROPRO. Invest your money elsewhere !"
4,Good review for New York State Court Officer exam,"Bought for NYS Court Officer Exam, too expensive, but it is a good study guide. Gives hundreds of pages of practice questions and good tips for the test. About 10-15% of the questions put in the study guide are filler questions (looked like they got them from a SAT or ACT test) that are irrelevant for court exam, but most of the questions are similiar to NYS Court officer exam, and the guide appears designed for that purpose. there are also some good tips for the interview process as well."
2,"Mostly, a disappointment","_The Theatre and Cinema of Buster Keaton_ makes some interesting points -- in particular, the ways in which Keaton was able to take what he learned on the Vaudeville stage and integrate it to astonishing effect in his films. There's also a fairly interesting discussion of his affinities with the Surrealists -- an example given is the underwater scene in ""The Navigator,"" where Buster is shown using lobster claws to cut a wire, and then getting into a sword fight with a swordfish using another swordfish as his weapon.But overall, the writing was ponderous, and the book seemed more like the citation-filled musings of an undergraduate than a mature, cutting-edge scholarly discussion. The book might be more bearable if the author didn't beat us over the head with the same arguments."
4,Get some insoles!,"I purchased these off snaz75 (buyer beware of this site, the have a low price guarantee that I had to contact my cc company.) amazon doesn't seem to carry my size in many shoes. I'm only a size 5. I do love these shoes, if you are use to wearing high heals, make sure you get good insoles, not the foot petals, it isn't enough cushion for the height of the heels, but I have worn them out and they are wearable for about 3 hours without sitting, after that, good luck."
4,Super cute,"these are so cute that i don't want to take it off. it is tricky to try to get it on but once you do the shoes fits like a glove. walking is extremely hard because the heel is very high. the ankle strap is very loose so i had to add some holes to it. after few hours my feet hurts like crazy, so don't plan on long trip with it. or have some other shoes as backup. make sure you stretch your feet and legs before and after wearing or you can get cramps. and yes, get insoles!"
1,JUNK,Box was open and bolt on idler was Bent. RETURNED it. Timing belt looked like some one tried to install it and returned it.
4,"FAIRLY WIDE SPECTRUM FOR THE ""FEEL GOOD"" SPARKLES","Before I saw this ""feel good"" masala SK starrer, the vibrant title song was pretty much the only number on this album that left a mark. With perhaps the disco kawwali thrown in for its contemporary thumps. But after you've seen the movie, the music fits and makes sense. It's a neat flick overall, with no pretentions of mega-meaningful moments. Nothing you'll spend your days and nights listening to, but a fairly worthy purchase for its pacy numbers (usable for clubs and parties) as well as for its romantic ballads (e.g., Gori Gori)."
4,The Firm edited for the States,"I watched the firm in this collection last night, and I also own the English release. Some of the scenes were cut for the American audience. When the black kid gets his face slashed with a Stanley knife, its not the violence that gets cut but the Hospital scene were he tells the copper his name is Michel Jackson and the copper says ""you will be needing some more plastic surgery Michel"""
2,Maybe a lemon..?,"I bought a senior before and it worked great until I dropped it and had to buy another one. I bought this one from this company and it was bad! It didn't work well! Its been awhile since I returned it, so I forgotten why I did, but I'm hoping this company doesn't re sell old used returned items to new customers!"
5,Clipping all the way,"I got these for my daughter for her birthday. She loved them. I was the first victim, I mean customer, & the haircut turned out excellent. It is a quality product, great price, & prompt delivery. All 10's!!"
2,"Great Motor, Poor Hair Clipper Guide Combs","The motor is so powerful. its so strong that makes the attachment(guide combs) came off when i was using it so i end up having an uneven hair. I tried contacting the seller but ""somehow"" their voicemail box is full so i did not have a chance to ask for a new set of attachment. I was gonna return the product but i need an RMA(required for returning products) but how i am i going to get it if i can get hold of the seller. VERY BAD!!"
1,Go back to the songs you used to sing in the 70's.,None of the songs click except knowing when to leave. This record is terrible.
5,"It's wonderful to have you back, Helen!","This is a wonderful CD filled with lesser-known show tunes sung by a certifiable pop legend, Helen Reddy. Her rich, articulte and unmistakably distinct voice, with that legendary perfect-pitch, is well-suited to these songs, and the orchestrations are first class. Helen Reddy dropped out of the music scene in the 80's and has been deeply missed by her legions of fans. This CD is a most welcome comeback that will bring endless pleasure and joy to lovers of Helen's voice and of broadway music. Bravo Helen. You've still got"
4,a real recording star,"Helen's voice is a great instrument. I had forgotten that she must have had something special about her voice to have had so many fans and radio hits in the seventies. The song selection is inspired and it sounds like a lot of money and talent was put into this album. There's a warmth and simplicity and intimacy that you don't get with the usual Broadway or cabaret singer who puts out an album. I'm a fan of the Betty Buckleys and Mary Cleere Harans but Helen Reddy has something extra in the recording studio, not to say anything about who's a better singer than whom overall."
4,The Confessor,"Well written, fast paced twists and turns.I would recommend this book to any mystery fan young or old.Jeffrey"
3,"Anti Catholicism - ""zzzzzzz""","The author's research on Pius XII is very much weighted towardthe ""Hitler's Pope"" view of things. He claims to have interviewedRonald Rychlak, but shows little of that point of view. The latestresearch on Pius counters much of the negative perspective. Ithardly makes for a courageous book these days to beat up onthe Vatican. Big deal. A really interesting read would be to presentthe subject honestly. The fact remains that Pius XII was probablyresponsible for saving more Jewish lives during World War II thanany other single person in the world. Rome's leading Rabbiconverted to Catholicism as a result of Pius XII's efforts. Basicallythe novel is interesting in its plot, but the implicit anti-Catholicismis, well, just a little bit predictable, boring, and tedious. (Note: Iam not a Catholic)."
3,"Good, But Not One of His Best","Silva has one of the best series of books in the spy/thriller genre. He writes well, has interesting plots, and the invariable twists and turns. Although I enjoyed ""The Confessor"", this is the first of Silva's books that I wasn't fully satisfied with. Partially, I was just turned off by the Da Vinci Code-esque Catholic Church conspiracy plotline that has gotten so overused. In his defense, at least Silva presents his plotline in a more balanced approach--its not a purely church-bashing story. Even with the flaws, this is still a fun and interesting book. We listened to the abridged version on audiobook and enjoyed it. 3 1/2 stars."
2,Disappointing and insubstantial story,"I found this to be a very disappointing novel -- cardboard characters, predictable and well-worn plot (secret Vatican societies infiltrating very powerful institutions everywhere), not well written, inconsistencies and contradictions within the story that the author or editors seemed oblivious to. This is only the second novel by Silva that I've read. I may try one more before giving up. I started with ""The Unlikely Spy,"" which, while flawed, had the same sort of pulse-pounding and smart story line as more well-known books like ""The Eagle Has Landed."" But ""The Confessor"" is inferior spy fiction, even by the standards of a such a heavily trod genre."
4,A good start.,"Having read several Silva books, out of order, it was good to fit this piece into the mosaic. That said, it was simpler than the others but as satisfying."
5,The Confessor,"""The Confessor"" was my introduction to Daniel Silva....What a Treat.Characters different from the usual being Intelligent, talented and lethal . The link to the Vatican is fascinating. The political goings on behind the scenes are to be believed. The Restorer part of the hero is presented with knowledge and love of the Old Masters.I highly recommend Daniel Silva's writing and look forward to enjoying my next adventure.Lantzville B.C."
4,Bless the Father,A strongly written novel. Fiction but as always somewhat based on fact. There was colusion with the church and the Nazi's during WW2 and that is the kernel for this story which makes it a winner. Mr. Silva always gives us good reads. his ability is up there with the best. I found this story to be very enjoyable and would highly recommend it.
3,not bad,"This is the first book by Daniel Silva that I have read. On the one hand, The Confessor has an interesting premise and plot, and is written in a competent manner. On the other hand, it suffers from being populated by a cast of supermen. That is, almost everyone in the book is some sort of high-ranking official, powerful banker, or expert assassin, etc. These characters glide over the real world, and consequently the action is almost devoid of the sort of gritty details that make a truly great book so captivating. Other reviewers have commented that this is not Silva's best work. I will probably try another Silva book such as Mark of the Assassin the next time I am looking for some light reading."
2,"if Gabriel is the best israelian spy, i'm God",So many flaws in the chain of thinking for an expert spy. It looks more like the main character survives this far is by pure luck. I have a feeling that a lot of spy out there are pulling their hairs out of fustration. I know I am and I am not a spy.
4,Very good book!,"My 1st time to read Daniel Silva's book. I wasn't disappointed. I thought I'm seeing a movie here while reading it's story. It may be only a fiction, but boy, what IF it was true? Hmmm. Good Job, Mr. Silva... I'll be reading his previous books, now that I'm hook with Gabriel Allon's character."
4,Very enjoyable story,"This was my first read of a Silva book, although I have read a number of the recent religious thriller-type books (is this the new hot storyline?) I found the action well-paced and exciting, the story believable (incredible as it was), and the research very detailed. The only criticism I have is that Allon is just not a character you can get into. He is just so stunted emotionally, or perhaps Silva doesn't want us in his head. He was a bit of an automaton in that he just acted, or reacted, throughout the book. If he is meant to be a pure action hero, that's one thing. But he is far too old and experienced as portrayed to go that route, in my opinion. Maybe there is more on him, his psyche, and his motivations in earlier books. Other than that, and the somewhat flatness of most of the characters, it was a fine read."
4,A Real Page Turner,"Silva, again entertains us with the overtly dramatic, subdued, almost passionless protagonist, Gabriel Allon; a man who for these very reasons seems to have captured 'us' as readers.Per usual, the plot is layer and complex, but never difficult to follow though this journey weaves though the politics of the Vatican, more sinister secrets from the Nazi's and (of course) hidden documents...of the earth shattering kind.My only quibble is for an agent of the Israeli Intelligence, Allon seems to fumble a bit more than usual in The Confessor...is our hero's age catching up with him?Nonetheless, still, Silva is a must read who know his stuff and how to present it, making the impossible almost seem plausible!"
3,Good Summer Pageturner,"Master Israeli spy Gabriel Allon is called in to investigate the death of a professor friend. He was killed because of a book he was writing, but what was in it that would cause his death? This book has the usual formulaic spy necessities - secret societies, double crossing, high speed chases, beautiful women and plenty of violence. The novel revolves around the Vatican and it's role during the Holcaust.The new Pope wants to release secret documents. Been there, done that in many novels before. Still the characters are fun and the novel keeps one turning pages."
5,A Solid Story,"Daniel Silva continues his tightly written style and produces another ""can't put it down"" book. Based on thorough research and recognizing diverse viewpoints, ""The Confessor"" presents a believable story of intrigue. ..."
4,A fast and engrossing read,"Daniel Silva is a skilled writer who for this book has done an admirable amount of research. The result is a well-presented intrigue yarn that further supports its author's position among the top thriller writers. The plot is speculative but based on sufficient fact to make it plausible. This author lays this out in a separate chapter. The characters are a bit abstract, and the plot is more interesting than the people, but this is a minor quibble in such a well-written novel."
5,As Close To Perfection for the Price!!!,"This machine is as close to perfection as you can get for the money. I have another EuroPro which is a piece of absolute crap that I can't even give away, but this one has outsewn everything, even my Heavy Duty machine by WHITE.It does all of the basics you need - such as straight and zig zag stitches and buttonholes. It comes with the essential accessories you need. It is lightweight and compact and doesn't hog space. At the time I got mine, it was available in royal blue, which makes quite the fashion statement.I recommend this to the beginner and the expert. I sew several layers of fleece in the making of teddy bears. It handles thick denim and silk with the same ease."
1,HORRIBLE,"I was looking for something basic to do hems and repairs. The thread in the bottom bobbin bunches every single time. I have tried adjusting tensions, changing thread type. It is always the same. And the instruction booklet leaves much to the imagination.I would not recommend this machine."
4,Great machine for all jobs,"This machine has worked great for all projects I have undertaken. It's a whiz at hemming anything, including denim. Projects from scratch are quick and easy sewing jobs. I chose 4 stars because the machine does not come with a case, which I think should be included with any machine. The machine itself is great!"
4,WAGNER LUG NUTS,I CHOOSE THESE LUG NUTS BECAUSE THE HUB CAPS FELL OFF WHEN WE WERE ON VACATION AND WHEN I WENT TO DO A BRAKE JOB EVERY LUG NUT SNAPPED OFF SO NOW I DID WHEEL BEARINGS AND BRAKES AND NEW HUB CAP FITS ON LUGNUTS NO PROBLEM
5,manhattan transfer of the 20th century,"This is the second pro recording for this Boston-based vocal group, and the production is fantastic. Vocal arrangements by Abe are intricate without being burdensome,and the vocal execution is superb. Especially like the ""jazzified"" turnouts of nontraditional jazz charts. Can't wait to hear some of the new recordings on their new USA label."
5,Very Satisfied,This sandle is exactly what he wanted. We could not be happier about this product or the price. Thanks Amazon!!!
5,My new favourite shoe,"I love Birkenstocks, and have always gone for the leather, but I thought I'd give the Birkibuc a try. Love it! It still conforms to my foot like leather does, but it doesn't stretch as much as leather so I don't have to cut new holes."
3,1st pair of Birks,"After years of speculating, I purchased this 1st pair of Birks not knowing what to expect. The cradle your foot is in, is at first difficult to get used to with the ridges but soon becomes comfortable.They may be good for walking anywhere that doesn't have pebbles, because once a pebble finds it way onto the footbed, you have to take off the shoe to shake it out.Otherwise the comfort level is definitely outstanding.I've been advised to not get them wet, that for me at least, is a new concept when wearing sandals.At this price, they are definitely worth a try."
4,great for foot problems,"These shoes are comfortable, after you break them in, and provide great support if you have issues with your feet. They are not stylish but are great if you have foot problems. I mostly wear these around the house or when running a quick errand."
5,Time to wake up,"Clearly a modern masterpiece that may be the only spiritual book you will ever need. If you are a truth seeker, buy this book. If you want to challenge your beliefs or should I say see them as the fiction they are, Jed can help. My life will never be the same."
1,Implausible Fiction,"""Spiritual Enlightenment The Damnedest Thing"" applies to the book more than it does spiritual enlightenment. Why it ever got published in the first place, why anyone gave it glowing reviews, or, even more mind boggling, why anyone actually read it, completely escapes me."
1,"This book is ""Not that, not that"" (hind. neti-neti)","Again a book with great aspiration that fails in conveying what was already said thousand times before. (Like for example Good News that, incidentally, never got out... - sigh-).This book is an instruction how not to slip on the banana peel by advising to lie down on the floor. At the same time ""I am enlightened and you don't"" seems reverberating all the time. If the author was really enlightened he want be running in circles in his narration but just tell us his point on 2-3 pages.Pros: there are words ""cool"" used several times (rejoice teens!) and nice story about skydiving. This is why it earns 1 star. Remarkable is that at this point author is so entranced by prospective death - finally something breaking boredom of the one that ""arrived"" prematurely. Do not waste your time for this book. If you want nutritious reading get ""Awareness"" by A. de Mello!"
1,No eckart Tolle here!,"I do not know what brand of enlightenment this man has, but he has a huge ego, no peace,love towards others. Just because you are antisocial and full of anger does not make you enlightened."
2,Boring,"I picked up a few good tips here and there from this book, but overall, I couldn't tell you what the book was about, and I read the book three times.The message is there for those who need to hear it I suppose."
1,Stay Away from this,"Self opinionated, self enlightened, load of clap trap, who at the best shows you how to tear away really basic veils, this person is stuck somewhere and will leave anyone who takes this childish outlook also stuck, the blind leading the blind, Sorry Jed but i'm where you are and moved on in many ways many years ago, as many others are and none of us are giving information because like you everything is based around you and your own self indulgences, i.e animal flesh, great intent, (oh but your minds beyond that illusion), this attitude is one bhudda that needs killing on the road, he intent is very ungrounded in this illusion and is not in a suitable place to share anything.Okay, Do yourself a favour, stay away from another made up false prophet, just do your course of miracles and when thats over sling that in the bin as well."
5,Wow! What a wonderful alarm clock!,"This is the best wake-up book I have ever read. And believe me, I have read a lot. Jed McKenna made me laugh about my own spriitual antics, take a good look at what I thought I wanted (but really didn't) and helped me realize that what I was seeking isn't really something that can be sought. You might say he just helped me get clear and ""lighten"" up! I think this book is the stick coming down on the head and he is the Zen Master delivering the blow. If your ready to have your beliefs stripped bare, this is for you."
5,Found a Jem,I had most of the recordings on single records back in the forty and fifties and lost them when overseasin the sixties. I found a CD with some of songs but not as many on the Kenton- Christie disc. It's like having an old friend back. She and Kenton were my favorite orchestra and singer.
4,A Well Made Walker,This is a very sturdy and well made walker. I don't need it all the time but it is a great help. It's a bit heavy but I think that makes it feel more secure and balanced. The price was great. Others I have seen at drug and department stores cost much more and seem a little flimsy.
1,NKOTB fans will only buy.,"Unless you like cheesy lyrics and you were a New Kids on the Block fan you will probably buy this album. I recommend save you money or make your choice on another cd. Joe McIntyre makes another weak comeback as a struggling musicians. The album as it's perks. The melody and beats of Never Gonna Give you up, Supergirl, and Fallen have potential of edging their way into radio air waves. Songs like Someday, Endlessly are sweet songs people can relate too but they are what you expect from an artist of this nature. The peppy upbeat songs are typical of McIntyre and burn your ears of scratchey singing. I heard the cd once and that was enough. You wonder why he considered 8:09 as the title. Was it the time he got married or the time he got his bride in the sack? However, Joe is taking little steps forward to finding his niche in writing music. This is better than any other music he has created but still weak."
1,sorry joey this album sucks,"Hi, I am a big joey Mcintyre fan(was a big fan),I have all 3 of his solo albums his first one was great his second one was even better not a bad song on the whole album,,,, but this 3rd album 8:09 sucks im sorry but it does the songs are boarinng and not catchy the album is horrable I cant believe i SPENT $17.99 on it,if your future cds will be this bad dont release any more.The first single off it is mediocre at best.MAYBE GET A NEW PRODUCER FOR THE NEXT ALBUM?"
1,Are You People On Drugs?,"This sucks. Maurice Starr please bring this kid back to the playground where you found him. And someone tell him that he can't sing, can't write and can't act."
5,can i say anymore!!!,"joey! joey! joey! you rock!! This album was simply fantastic!! Alot of people don""t get california! we""ll me and my sister get it. It was so so funny yo!! when ever you smile you make the world a better place. keep doing music like this. It makes me and everyone happy! your voice is beautiful! I know everyone is proud of you. I think back to when I was younger you simply changed the world. you changed my life forever! I thank GOD for you!! LOVE FOREVER!! christy."
4,8:09 gets an 8 out of 10 in my book,"With the hype of 8:09 that seemed to get built up by the horse's mouth section of Joey's site I was excited about this album. I'm not disappointed by 8:09 but I'm not excited about it either. I bought it the day it came out and it is better than ""Stay The Same"" and possibly on the same level as ""Meet Joe Mac"". I would say it is a good album, but not great. I haven't gotten sucked into it like I have with George Michael's Patience or JC Chasez's Schizophrenic. 8:09 is good if you are a fan of Joey, but I don't think his audience will get bigger with this release. My only real complaint is the version of Falling thats on this album. Just the mood of it isn't as good as the version on One Too many. Also musically it is really cheesy at times wich kills this great song."
4,Amazing Song Writing-Excellent Lyrics-GREAT ALBUM,"I am a major music fan of any genre, and i have followed Joey Mcintyre for a long time. THis is hands down his BEST album yet. Stay the same was an album mostly writen by Sony Records and pushed by them. Joey never got to write music the way he wanted to. Meet Joe Mac was an in between album, i think it helped him find his grove. The very RARE Endlessly live in New York album was an amazing album that really showcased Joey's talent.Hands down when you get this album, never stop listening, its amazinly well writen, great lyrics and amazing beats and aweseom vocals. Joey really did it with this album, i hope he does another just as good. Great work Joe, the album is AWESOME."
5,His best CD yet!,This CD has some songs of Joe singing about his new wife. They are great songs and more mellow than his usual pop music. I would recommend this CD to anyone who has found their future wife or is searching for one. Supergirl is one of my favorites.
3,Long time Joe fan disappointed,"I'm 25 years old and have loved Joe since I was in the 4th grade. It's really hard for me to say anything critical of my favorite singer, but I think this album is a step back for someone who has a world of talent. There are a few good songs, but the overly bad songs overshadow the album and make it difficult to listen to the whole thing all the way through. The new version of Eman's ""Falling"" is horrible--it sounds like a circus tune in parts. Songs like ""California,"" ""I'd Never Get Over You,"" and ""Love Me That Way"" just don't cut it. I would have liked it if Joe would have carried over the more-grown up, less-pop vibe from the One Too Many album. For the next album, let's hope Joe takes a different turn and tries some Sinatra-sounding tunes. In the meantime, I'll hope Joe does come tour to a city near me:-)"
3,"""L. A. BLUE"" the only memorable song on this CD.",The title of this review says it all. McIntyre has a pleasant vocal quality but the musical production surrounding this project plays out as demos for the Backstreet Boys. McIntyre should spread his artistic wings and attempt to dabble in a more complex and mature musical sound. It would better suit his age and may win over much needed new fans. Unfortunately this CD is not repulsive nor is it a work of art. It may leave you lukewarm. You won't hate it but I do not think that it will win you over. I doubt this CD will make any serious impact on the top 40 charts.
1,Can Joe tell time?,Another weak attempt for Joe McIntyre. This album was such a let down. His Meet Joe Mac is better than this one. At least that one has original and fresh new material. 8:09 has been heard by everyone but 3 songs. Joe you can at least put out new material on this cd besides swiping it from another cd and from your live stuff. Save your pennies people this album is not worth buying.
1,No hope!,This album has know hope of going near fake gold plated rims. The entire album sucks!!! Joe's vocals are horrid! Give it up Joseph and try another profession.
4,GOOD,Love Me That Way shows Joe's vocal range-very well doneCalifornia is a song I would pass though it should be listened to at least once.Falling was funny to hear in concert though on the cd I like the instruments- It sounds Greek probably because it is Eman's song off his CD.Tracks 1-8 show where Joe McIntyre is in life now. There is so much feeling and devotion given to each song.
4,Meet Joe Mac was better...,"His second release ""Meet Joe Mac"" was better IMO, but this is still a good pick up."
2,Definitely not his best work AT ALL.,"It's cheesy as heck, but so is Joe. While promoting it, Joe tooted this album as his most ""emotionally open"". Which it is...for a 9th grader passing a note to a girl he likes in study hall. L.A. Blue is reminiscent of Billy Joel's earlier works. Joe needs to stay away from the dance music and concentrate on the accoustic rock style that he was getting at in Meet Joe Mac and that kind of come across in Endlessly (A song written by Joe and Eman while driving from Washington State back to NYC in the days right after Sept. 11th 2001), Falling (written and originally performed solo by Eman), and L.A. Blue.Lose the songs like California. They are lame and a waste of space."
5,Excellent Resource...,"I'm not sure what the previous reviewer was talking about (perhaps he read another book). This book is extremely useful, and it is an excellent resource for career changers!"
1,Euro Pro Garment Steamer,"Don't buy this item. The first time I tried to use it ,it did't work . The steamer went on for about 20 seconds. Repeated attempts had the same results. Have tried to reach the company for over a month many times a day. All I get is busy signals.Prior to this I bought Euro Pro's hand steamer , It also did'nt work. I would never buy another one of this company's products."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!,"Brand new out of the box, this steamer doesn't work and never has produced any steam.The company does not respond to repeated requests to honor the warranty or to repair the item. The item was thrown out with the trash."
2,It was fine until it began leaking,"I've had this steamer for about 6 months and was pleased with it (in spite of its hose which is too short to reach the top of my drapes) until a few days ago when it suddenly began leaking hot water all over the floor. Fortunately, I purchased it from a store with a great return policy. It is going back to the store today."
1,So Disappointed :(,"If the darn thing didn't always stop working, I would love it. I bought one about 2 1/2 years ago, loved it, then about a year and a half in, it just stopped working. I immediately went out and bought another one, thinking it was a fluke (wish I had seen these reviews) and that one just stopped working this week. So the first one lasted about a year and a half and the second one lasted about a year. The rest of the ""problems"" never bothered me. It heated up fast, worked fantastically and mine didn't leak. Yes, its rickety, but it also didn't cost that much. However, now that two have broken, obviously I will not buy a third. I am concerned, though, that I will buy one that may last longer but won't work as well, so I am torn in that respect."
1,Totally Bummed,I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought the steamer. After two months of great use (I love steaming instead of ironing) I now have the mysterious won't turn on problem. I have emailed technical assistance but from what I read here I don't think I'll be hearing from them. If I do hear from them I'll let you know the results...in the meantime DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
1,You couldn't do worse,"When I first took the unit out of the box, I knew I had made a mistake. Not only does the unit itself fell cheaply constructed, but all of the attachments are held together by primitive, easy-to-break levers. When turned on, the unit is loud and hemorrhages scalding water all over your clothes. I would have returned it, but attachments had arrived broken already. We tried using it on the set of an independent film - we were surprisingly relieved when the product burned itself out after a few hours of operation.Don't buy it."
1,"Was a 5-star, Now a 1-star","I loved this product!!!! It worked great and I was a devout ""steamer convert."" After about two months though, the motor burned out on it and the smell was horrific. I called customer service who told me to clean it with fresh water. Obviously that did not fix it. I have now been tasked with boxing it up and paying for shipping both ways for EuroPro to fix it. Now it just one steaming pile of youknowwhat. The cost for shipping and the painintheassness of it all will lead me to buy a different brand of steamer (can't live without it now) and never buy a EuroPro item again."
1,This is a piece of junk!,"Struggled with this item for a year now. It works sporadically, doesn't steam that well, and the on off switch continually malfunctions. It is cheaply made of plastic and some of the paint has melted off. It is tippy and the water reservoir has a poorly fitting plastic cap that leaks if you can ever get it on to begin with. DON'T BUY."
4,So far so good...,"I've had this steamer for about a month now without problems. It takes ~1-2 minutes to heat up and puts out enough steam to do the job well and quickly. I kept my iron handy for any tough jobs I didn't think the steamer could handle, but have yet to need the thing. Works well on shirts, pants, and coats. The steam is hot and will hurt if you get too close to the vent but it's not scalding and will not burn. So far the only fault I can find is that after ~4-5 min. of continuous use the steam will stop coming out for ~30 seconds...but it's always comes back on.I was surprised to read so many negative reviews, if I have any problems I will re-post. So far, its been an excellent value for the money and I love the thing!!!!"
2,powdered look,"I ordered this item for touch ups throughout the day for my Vincen Longo foundation. The foundation looks great on my skin. Unfortunately, the pressed powder does not come on silky like-it gives way too much of a powdered look. I would not order this product again."
4,Purolator Air filter,"Filter was as listed, except it had to have the rubber seal trimmed in order to fit in the air filter housing properly. Apparently not quite to factory spec for the vehicle listed."
3,Worst quality sound of any Tallis Scholars CD I've heard,"I gave this CD three stars because the performance seems to be about a 4.5. However the sound, to my ears, is simply terrible: very tinny, very unnatural sounding. Possibly this a result of it also having been released as a SACD, which I believe the Tallis Scholars have only done twice, both times in 2006 and never since, which may be an indication they weren't happy with the results. (Perhaps the SACD sounds just fine, I am only reviewing the CD.)Where is the midrange? Where is the low end? Certainly this is not the first of their CDs to sound too bright to my ears (marring somewhat one of their very best performances: their Josquin masses ""Malheur me bat""/""Fortuna desperata""). But this is MUCH worse, many times worse. I cannot listen to this CD. I never wish to hear it again."
4,"Lots of Fun, Lots of Stellar Playing","OK, I have to admit from the outset that the album has a little bit of an identity problem. It ranges across musical styles so widely that a listener does not know where he or she will end up next.BUT that's also the fun of it. Some pieces (e.g., McDermott's cartoon-like rendition of ""The Stars and Stripes Forever"")are laugh-out-loud funny. Others have a more subtle light-heartedness. Still others have an intensity that reminds one of great blues piano masters. Parts of the album could have been done by a New Orleans Jazz version of Frank Zappa (perhaps under the title ""Crawfish Rip My Flesh""). Others sound more like Otis Spann. Some seem post-modern in their flippant irony. Others are like a nostalgic look back to the days of the li'l rascals.McDermott, as always, is technically excellent. His Nightcrawlers Brass Band is in great form, and the other featured musicians (e.g., clarinetist Evan Christopher) are outstanding."
4,"Metals, and nothing but the metals","This book is a history of men's use of metals. The book begins with metals and ores used during the Neolithic, and proceeds down to a chapter on modern metalworking. In general, the author's focus is on the composition of the metals (i.e. other metals purposely or accidentally alloyed in), and on the techniques of smelting, etc. As such, this book discusses the metals themselves in depth, but contains very little information on the societies' development and use of them."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made.,"I was awestruck at how TERRIBLE this film was. It was worse than ""Bug"" and that's saying something! I gave it to a friend just to get it out of my collection."
1,Worst movie,This movie was so bad I could not even get into the first 15 minutes. That was pretty hard considering it was one of the shortest movies I ever bought. It was a complete waste of my money. Please don't even consider throwing your money away.
1,A Warning,"Warning: the clothes that come with the dolls in this collection are nearly impossible to get on the dolls. between my wife and I, we spent over 20 minutes trying to get a skirt on without ripping it. Very frustrating for my daughter, as she cannot change the clothes herself."
4,Beautiful Book of Historic British Buildings,"Beautiful coffee table or general reading book. Stunning photographs. Good description of the history of each area in the begininng of each chapter. I would have made some different inclusions, left out are Oxford, Westminster Abbey, Leeds Castle, Canaervon Castle & Fowey. But inc. are Warwick Castle, Arundle Castle, The Tower of London, Bath, Cambridge and a varied assortment of choices across the ages."
1,Absolutely disgraceful price,"Yes, I know this review has nothing to do with the product. I am just trying to save some poor soul from spending an absolutely outrageous price on an item you should be able to find for between $32-$45. Don't buy this item at this price!"
3,For weight trainers,Just got this because i wanted better muscle definition. I will revise the video after a few more weeks to see if there is any results. I am a gym rat.
1,This is junk,"This doesnt do anything. Stick to the treadmill and a sweatshirt (and good diet). This crap is for the birds man. No one needs this trust me. For the price, you can get your essential fatty acids from cheap fish oil capsules or flax seeds and get 2-3x more product."
4,So far so good...,"Received my order of CLA Fuel and started taking the daily recommended dose (1 pill 3 times daily). I purchased this particular brand of CLA because of the 3x5 star positive reviews. The only thing I wish I'd done before ordering was to do a bit more research with CLA, as I've found that the original scientific studies on CLA were a special form of it called, ""tonalin."" I think I'll have to try this and follow-up with another review based on its effectiveness. I will also be sure to continue exercising and eating healthy to ensure I give it a fair shot. Note: these gel caps are HUGE, but easy to swallow."
5,Mom's favorite,This is my mom's favorite candy. She loved it as a kid and has trouble finding it these days. So glad I could buy her an entire tin for her birthday!
1,candy,you pay for the can because the bag of candy is so small you can eat it in one setting and not gain 1 pound
1,Sure not Good n Plenty,Sorry to you folks that like this stuff. We had never had Snaps before and certainly never will again. Nasty tasting stuff. Yuk!
3,A STEP DOWN,Swallowed in Black and A Vision of Misery were definitely thier best. They took time off befor releasing this one and it lacks the intensitiy and raw power of the first two. Its stil good but once youve heard Vision its just not the same.
3,Bjorling fans will relish this,"I did not know that he sang the Masked Ball, let alone that anyone recorded it until a couple of months ago. This recording is a real treat. True, it has flaws. There are 4 1/2 minutes of static and the other singers are not so hot although they are adequate. But Bjorling comes through clear and silvery and lovely as ever and those who love the great voice will delight in this new and unexpected treat. Imagine a whole new opera with Bjorling after 50 years! Especially such a great tenor opera."
2,not as good as the older style,The top clean out is sealed with a rubber o-ring and a twist. Very hard to close while off. almost impossible when in place. actually broke one when trying to install the cap. bought an ABS version with the older screw in type cap and worked well. buy the old style and skip this one.
5,Very Good Read,The story is well written. I began to care about the characters and missed them when the story ended. I would like to read more from this author.
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!!,"I would recommend this book to anyone. This is an amazing, well written, gripping story. Delores Phillips may just be the new Toni Morrison."
4,the darkest child,this book was rich with southern flavor and I can not wait to see the movie.......
1,A string of random nothingness,"This was one of the worse books I have ever read. It was a string of unrelated events, far too many uninteresting character s, and no purpose or storyline."
3,Well written but disturbing...,"I couldn't seem to put the book down but I was constantly baffled by some of the evil. For one thing, the book was most certainly not predictable."
5,Absolutely a mouth dropper....,I HAD to rated this a five. With every chapter I was stunted. If you have not read this book GET it. The mother in this book is suffering from some type of bipolar craziness & the children are living with every emotion she has. I have already told several people about this book hope they get it.Tye Cooper
2,"So so book, probably not worth the effort","Ruthlessly depressing, relentlessly bleak, and not written well. It was also filled with many inaccuracies about life for blacks in the 1960s south. The book had potential but could've been tighter and more cohesive."
5,Unforgetable,This is the best book I have read in some time. I couldn't put it down. I felt like I personally knew these people and was living in the house with them. I didn't want the book to end. Ms. Phillips made me stop reading every now and then to take a deep breath. She made it so real. I am looking forward to her next novel.
5,My Life,"I thought I was all alone in the world until I read your book Ms. Phillips.I had a life as such and only in reverse, the ten children, we were 7 boys and 3 girls. I never knew why my mother treated me the way she did, and as for color she was the Darkest one.I was getting beaten for existing I guess. When I left home at sixteen, I never return. I didn't even go too her funeral when she died. I didn't have to worry about her coming for me at anytime , all she cared about was Men and Money. Some of the things she made Tangy Mae do, well I'd be dead today. My Mother was a lot worst than Rozelle, one my little brother was playing with eyes on the kitchen stove, she came up too him and put his hand in the fire and then put them on his face, he died with those scars on his face. I'm the oldest child.This is a GREAT GREAT BOOK."
5,Touching,"I finished this book with tears in my eyes! Just trying to imagine a mother treating her children the way Rozella did was very disturbing. This has to be one of the best books that I have read in a long time!This is not a book to ignore. You will enjoy it, and hate the mother at the same time."
5,It's about time!,"I'd stopped reading black authors quite a while ago because I'm not into chic love and urban romance novels. I want to read something of substance and Phillips does a bang up job of providing literary sustenance to readers such as me.""The Darkest Child"" is one of the most incredible stories I've ever read! Rarely are readers treated to such well-developed, multi-faceted characters in a book. Phillips duplicates life by demonstrating that no matter who we are or what we do, each of us shifts the paradigm of life.Kudos to Phillips and her proud family, and I look forward to reading the next novel(s)."
5,Astounding!!!!!!,"The darkest child is simply an astounding book. I can't believe that I took so long to get to it. The story is gripping and will command the readers' attention. If you want to know what it was like to live in a world of segregation and mental deterioration, then I highly recommend this book."
4,Exceptional Read! Cover????,I agree with the original poster. this book is FANTASTIC ..one of the best I have read in a VERY long time ..however the original cover was definitely better. This new one shows a child who looks NOTHING like what the original protogonist (Tangy Mae)is described as. Bring back the original!
5,Awesome!,This novel was outstanding. Every part of the story had me clinging to my kindle for more. I recommend this story to anyone's
2,Disappointment,Purchased based on b and n online rating. Generally enjoy historical fiction / period novel especially those set in the south but I really had to push to get through this. Too many characters that came in and out of the story line. No real full character development of any likable character. The one character I wanted more about disappeared in to the drawn out plot line.
5,A very interesting book,"Told from the perspective of Tangy Mae - the darkest child - this story is about a woman Rozelle Quinn who has ten children with ten different men. The abuse - physical and other - that she showers upon them is deeply disturbing. Even though the society in which they lived was brually racist and unjust, yet at the Quinn home where daughters were forced by their mother into prostitution and two of them were even murdered, injustice was more palpably felt.There were three sons, whom Rozelle treated much better than her daughters. How the children refrained from ganging up against their mother was remarkable.To me the book ended on a somewhat unfulfilling note. I would have liked to see Rozelle getting what she deserved."
5,Wow Moving!,This book was very good. It is moving and sad. You have to think how in the world could anyone endure all this from a mother and the world around them. I found my self going to bed early or waking up in the middle of the night to read this book.
5,Got To Read,This book was excellent. Well written and very captivating. I recommend everyone read it. Can't wait to read more from this author.
5,Phenomenal,"This book rang so true that I cried through half of it. I felt so ashamed of the hatefulness in people's heart. Racism is not only stupid, but black people who think like this girl's evil mother are even worse. I loved Tangy's story and I hated for it to end. At the same time, I got sick of her mother getting away with sickness and her brothers and sisters suffering. I will never get over the little baby sister and what happened to her. It is so sad. You should buy this and ""Flesh and the Devil"" by Kola Boof if you want to read the best writing. Both books deserve a 10 +"
4,Great Read,"Overall a great read. It felt a little unfinished and there were some grammatical errors throughout that should have been caught before publication, but the storyline kept me engaged so it didn't matter as much. I would recommend this book to a friend."
5,"One you will never forget, but you may have to put it down for a while and clear your mind",This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It makes you love and appreciate your mother. The mother in PRECIOUS has absolutely nothing on this mother.
4,The Darkest Child,"This book was a quick read. The book touch on a very real issue on how blacks discriminate with in the race and the depression that was not diagnoised during that time period. The mother was ridiculous crazy, and her children were TOO loyal. It shows that children despite all want to be love by their parents and want to be apart of a family."
4,Good Read,"Good book to read. The story line was a little drawn out, and dramatic. I was able to finish the book though. I loved Tangy Mae character,shows that you can overcome most situations in life."
3,Crazy story,This was a crazy book. Some of the things the mom did to her kids was crazy and unbelievable. This book was an okay read.
3,Good Read,"I bought this book almost everyone gave it a 5/5, but sorry, I can't...good read, but was hoping for so much more..."
5,Best book on the subject,"I knew very little about this incident in recent history before I picked this book up. It is incredibly informative, powerful, and gripping. This is journalism at its best. He's also a great artist. I'm currently on a mission to read everything this guy has done. I'm about 75% of the way there, but this one is still my favorite."
1,Safe Area Gorazde,"This is a comic book, entirely. There is no text (other than that in the text bubbles), no bibliography, no substantiation of the material presented, no analysis. The historical accuracy of the events presented has nothing to provide verification. If you're looking for a book to provide information regarding the war in Bosnia, this isn't it. If you use comic books as your basis for knowledge and understanding, this is probably a good book. If you can read above a 2nd grade level, this book is below you. Unfortunately, there were but two pages scanned to preview before purchase. Also unfortunately, it appears that the literary world is devoid of quality books regarding the war. If you're desparate for a deeper understanding of the war, this book will be a great disappointment."
5,The highest form of art,"War reporter and master artist, Joe Sacco, paints for us some of the devastated lives in war-torn Bosnia. We are here shown the self-perceived ""retaliatory"" punishments meted out to the Bosnians by the Serbs. As Sacco bears witness to these events, one is reminded of Tolstoy's notion that ""every punishment is based not on logic or on the feeling of justice, but on the desire to wish evil on those who have done evil to you or another person."""
3,Dead Beat,"Keeps you interested but not enthralling enough, you can leave and come but later . A quick light read but a lacks substance."
4,dead beat,I'm a big fan of Mc Dermid as usual I wasn't disappointed .It was one of my new experiences on kindle & I enjoyed it as much as a hard paperbackanother must read from one of my favorite author of this genre
3,A competent tough-chick PI story,"Val McDermid writes really well, though she's constrained here by the standard female PI formula. Kate Brannigan is smart and sassy, can't cook, does martial arts, understands computers, and all that required stuff. In fact, Kate's just a little bit too modern-girl to be true - she lets her boyfriend move next door, but to keep her own space, won't give him her key... that kind of thing, I am also so over the whole Rock Star lifestyle behind the scenes stuff, and end was very Agatha Christie - Kate revealing the killer's identity to the suspects assembled in the living room. But if you like female PI stories and want a change from VI Warshawski, then you could do a lot worse. And if you're into serial murder books, The Mermaids Singing, by the same author, is about the best one I've ever read."
4,"Interesting geology, but not a field guide","This book was written by a middle-school science teacher with a doctorate in education. As a lifelong South Carolina resident, I found it interesting and challenging enough for adult readers such as myself, but there are only a moderate number of photos and drawings, and only 5 color plates, plus the front and back covers. The book's strengths, for my purposes, are the lists of the rocks and minerals likely to be found in each region of the state, plus the detailed explanations of how they came to be here; and the fascinating history of the gold rush in South Carolina, which I was unaware had taken place. Other people with other interests might enjoy the chapter on the mysterious ""Carolina Bays"" or the one about fossils, which is particularly long and detailed."
5,Perla Batalla Rocks,If you haven't heard this great singer you have to check out her Discoteca Batalla. I love Cucurucucu the best but all her CD's are great!!! Check out her music on perla.com
5,BBS is SKA,East Bay SKA for NorCal. East Bay Hooligans know that this is the shiznit for SKA in California. They need to re-form and make another album.
5,"Stark, beautiful Brazilian sambas from Bahia","A delicious folkloric set of Brazilian ""sambas de roda"" (circle sambas), featuring an elderly, 87-year old Bahian singer with a remarkably robust voice. This sounds very similar to records by Clementina De Jesus or Ivonne Lara; fans of folkloric groups such as Cuba's Los Munequitos de Matanzas might like this as well...Dona Edith has attracted some heavy-hitting ""youngsters"" to her side, including superstars Maria Bethania and Caetano Veloso, who each contribute sweetly restrained duet vocals, and Mariene De Castro, who sings on several songs. As the head of the Quintanda label, Bethania is the album's executive producer; I believe Dona Edith and her Vozes Da Purificacao ensemble have also been featured on some of Bethania's recent albums. Nice record... highly recommended!"
5,"parting words, parting ways",This book is a beautiful tribute to pets that have gone over to the rainsbow bridge to wait for us. It's a comfort to know that others have gone through the same grieving process as I have with the loss of a pet as one would with a friend or family member. The understanding of kindred spirits is a consolation.
4,Saying Goodbye,Reading the letters people from all over the world had written to their pets made clear the universal love we feel for animals. A great book for someone who has recently lost a beloved pet.
4,Everything else she has done is a 5+,"I am a big Lori McKenna fan. If I had to pick 3 artists' work to take to a desert island, hers would be among them. If you read all the reviews here, you will see that many of her ""old"" fans are less than enamored with Unglamorous, while those new to her work are wowed. This would not be my first choice of a McKenna CD because of the reasons cited elsewhere. I am used to her unadorned raw talent. My favorite cd is the Kitchen Tapes, which is just what it says: a recording made by McKenna at her kitchen table. That said, this one is still way, way better than most of the schlock coming out of Nashville. Not only that, but it is growing on me the more I listen to it. Give McKenna a try. This one will do just fine. You will end up with all of her cds before you are finished. I cannot think of a single song on any of her cds (and I have them all) that I reach for the ""skip"" button on."
2,Same songs...Less Soul...and OVERLY glamourous,"Very few songwritters do I ever consider artistically unique. But in Lori's previous albums, she was able to show a vulnerable, human soul that not everyone is brave enough to bare...not only in her lyrics but in her voice and sound, which leaves the listener able to connect with and fall in love with her old music. Unfortunately, her new CD has none of that vulnerability or heart that she had in her previous albums. With the new producers, I have thought of an analogy of what they did with her original sound; Imagine the some art producers took an original Van Gogh painting, but before they sold it, thought they would sell more by smearing rainbow and gold glitter and all over it. One word: KITSCH."
4,Lori in Nashville,"This is a good album, but while listening to it I can't help thinking that there are too many mainstream Nashville fingerprints all over it. I saw Lori live recently with her regular band and felt that the arrangements when they played were more well-suited to Lori's songs. Perhaps knowing how this album was produced had an influence on me, but in any case, I much rather go back and listen to Lori's excellent and more genuine previous album, Bittertown. Good stuff, though I'd love it if Lori could muster up a few songs with lyrics that are a bit upbeat once in a while."
5,Lori is AMAZING,"I first heard of Lori from OPRAH. I am not a fan of hers, but Lori is an absolute darling in country music. Her songs tell a story. You feel the emotion. I love this Cd from beginning to end. I think the best song is either ""I Know You"" or ""Confetti."" The only problem is really country radio. They will not play any artist that is not Kenny or Toby or RF. When I first listened to the Cd I imagined other artists signing her songs. She is a GREAT writer and that may be the only way she is known to the world. Buy this CD and get her name and music out to the world. She deserves it."
3,Unglamorous Lives Up to Its Title,"I've listened to Lori's music since I caught her at an open mic night way back in the day. I've seen her in rooms that have a 50 person capacity - it was at one of those shows that I bought ""The Kitchen Tapes."" From the first time I heard her play, I knew there was something special. She gives me goosebumps - in the best way.It happened when I saw her live on a Boston Harbor Cruise the night Unglamorous came out. It happened the first time that I listened to ""Leaving This Life"" on Unglamorous. I was disappointed when it didn't happen more: on past albums, nearly every song gave me chills.I don't begrudge Lori for her dreams come true. I don't believe that she sold out, or that she doesn't deserve major label success: she does.I'll continue to support her, continue to buy her work: she's an amazing talent. But if I could only own one Lori McKenna album, Unglamorour surely would not be my choice."
2,Nashville Pop,"Well this is what happens when a brilliant independent artist is produced by a factory-made country star. Just as formulated and generic as one can get. That's country music Nashville style.Keep in mind that this is Lori's first outing with co-writers (as if she ever needed one). I have a feeling that Faith Hill threw Lori into the whole Nashville scene (considering she covered some of Lori's best work and ruined it) or maybe it's Lori's manager. Either way Nashville doesn't fit Lori and Lori doesn't fit in.These songs are a bit too catchy, a bit too overproduced. I will say there are a couple of standouts; 'Your Next Lover' and 'Witness To Your Life' that remind me of Lori before she attempted to go pop-country. Back when she was playing coffee shops and writing all of her own music and lyrics.I am happy this will bring to fans to Lori. I just hope they purchase her better work, namely 'The Kitchen Tapes'. Lets hope Lori doesn't fall too far down the major-label hole."
2,welcome to NashVegas,"As a long time fan, I was pleased and happy for Lori when Faith Hill picked up a few tunes for one of her projects. Money in the pocket for a straight forward and honest artist. When I heard Tim McGraw was going to produce her next CD I knew where it was headed. No doubt she will enjoy greater commercial success, but her tunes suffer on this CD from the typical over production it takes to bring in a broad audience. Perhaps she will make her money and do a Patty Loveless and return to ""dance with them that brung her""."
4,"unglamorous, no way!",Lori is certainly underated. A pretty lady writes and always produces great songs. A classy woman we all love. Thanks again lori. Amazon is always good for providing hidden treasures like lori mckenna.
1,Invasion of the Talent Snatchers,"Tim McGraw and Faith Hill left a pod under Lori McKenna's bed. And said pod, just like in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" converted Lori to ""one of them."" The Kitchen Tapes...Paper Wings & Halo...Pieces of Me...and Bittertown. All brilliant. Each one better than the last. Now Unglamorous. The pod people have helped Lori make an album of country glop. I guess once you make Oprah cry and have a feature done on you for Nightline, the uniqueness kind of goes away. I wish Buddy Miller would've produced Lori's new album. He's one of the best guitarists/producers in roots music today. If you liked Lori's previous albums, I suggest you pass on this one. You'll be disappointed. Go buy a Patty Griffin or Kathleen Edwards album instead."
1,All the capacity is for batteries -,"I was hoping the image was wrong and that the clear area where the pepper and salt shows was not the only capacity for these devices. Also, was looking forward to one-handed use while cooking, instead of using my two excellent sets of William Bounds hand-grinding salt & pepper mills. Sad to say, all the capacity is for the 6 required AA batteries, and the way we go through sea salt and pepper here, I'd be filling these once a week at least. Sending these back with nothing to lose but the return shipping."
5,"Wonderful item, and unique gift","My family has enjoyed the MIU France stainless-steel battery-operated salt and pepper mill set. I have given several sets for wedding gifts. You have fresh pepper fast and easy, and just enough salt. The set takes several batteries, but they last a long time."
3,Salt and Pepper,"These both work fine but don't match up to the battery operated pepper mill I had previously. My mother liked them when she came to visit so I ordered her a set also. They do the job, I just with that the pepper would grind a little finer. These are also good for grinding herb and spice mixtures, it makes it convenient when you consisently use the same blend of spices you don't have to pull out all the different bottles."
4,MIU Salt and Peppermill set,Very good value for the money. I gave them as gifts. It is very nice to have the light to assess the amt of salt and peeper you are adding.
2,More of a pepper SPLITTER than a pepper grinder.,"A disappointing product overall.The look/appearance of these grinders is nice, smooth contemporary design. I also enjoyed how they have a light that illuminates your food as you grind.The quality of the grind left much to be desired. These mills have two settings, coarse and more coarse. As you see in the title, I think it's inappropriate to characterize these tools as ""grinders""; ""splitters"" would be more accurate. Although some small specs of pepper do come out, most of the chunks were large enough to crunch when you ate them. This occurred on both ""fine"" and ""coarse"" settings.If you don't mind coarse, rocky pepper, this is the perfect set for your home. If you prefer nice, evenly ground pepper, you should look elsewhere."
3,Nice but not spectacular,"For some reason, this watch is not as nice as what I expected. It is somewhat klunky for my small wrist and the face is pretty, but it is not spectacular in any way. I guess I am spoiled, but I wish it was thinner and lighter weight. There is certainly nothing wrong with it and it keeps great time. I will keep it but will look for something a little more dressy and a little less heavy looking."
1,Spiritually Misguided,"I was very disappointed in this book. Although it contained extensive background and historic info on each ""Bad Girl"", I felt that it was spiritually weak and not biblically correct in its opinions. Jezebel was one of the most wicked women ever explored in the Bible, yet the author describes her as ""religiously committed, politically savy, determined, self-assured, bodacious, and clever. She was dedicated to her family and a zealous missionary for Baal. And she died as she lived--royally!"" From this desription, you would have thought she was Mother Teresa instead of a violet woman who had many prophets killed just because they were men of God. The author also comes across as anti-male. I was disappointed and felt I had wasted my money."
1,biblical study of women of the Bible,"Thank you for the prompt, responsible service, but the purchased book was worthless and I cannot recommend it,due to no fault of yours. The author of this particular book exploited the study by twisting ideology to meet agenda of the the feminist movement, rather than God's agenda. Fortunately, another author has taken the same concept, and studied these 'undesirable 'women in a biblically, scholarly way. Thanks ! Barbara"
1,Not a Christian book,This author gives a person her false ideas. By the time I read to page 3 I knew it was blasphemy.
3,Nancee Swartz,"It is important to know the difference between indoor and outdoor cooking techniques. This book is recommended for novices to outdoor grilling recipes, techniques and the tools you would need to barbeque, grill, deep-frying and using rotissere supplies. This book starts from the basics and can be used as an resource for broiled, grilled and deep-fryed meals for your family."
5,Best book ever...,"This is by far, the best cookbook we own. It is huge, and contains every recipe you could ever want or need for rubs, marinades, sauces, every kind of meat, great sides, and even cocktails...this book is like a textbook for grilling because it teaches you so much about every which way to use your grill. We have given it as gifts and everybody has loved it and even bought it for their friends and family as gifts! Buy this book and you can throw away any other grilling books you own."
3,Worthwhile,"This book contains useful information. I don't think it is profound, but it is worth the price and worth reading. If you think you could benefit by improving your thinking, you'll get your money's worth."
3,Get Past the PC/Agenda to the Good Parts,I was excited when I began reading this book as it contained a great list of ideas and seemed to be on track with other critical thinking books I have read. It gave solid ideas on how to look and evaluate your thinking. THEN.... it went off the cliff for me. Interjecting strong and often ultra liberal politically correct perspectives on world/state/government issues that really were a turn off. It is too bad because there are some great ideas in the book. I almost stopped reading it because of the jamming of an agenda into it-- but I carried on and found more useful information.
2,merp,"it was pointless to read.. thank goodness it was free, because if I paid for this I would have been very upset"
4,Fun reading,"Genny is a genie.She lives in a bottle called Throttle,and it is very plush inside that bottle.When escaping from an angry wizard,Genny had little choice but to be zapped into a genie,and now she has been alive,granting wishes for about 300 years.But the twist is that she can't actually use magic to do this.She pretty much has to plan things out,and wishers don't always get exactly what they want.But they always end up happy,that's Genny's own breed of magic!!This time she's helping Nadia,a girl who wants to be noticed.Plenty of fun to read."
2,Unrealistic and Slightly Annoying,"I borrowed this book from the library, expecting it to be a fun story. But after reading the first few chapters, I found that I was rolling my eyes at the unrealistic storyline, unlikable and self-centered Genny, and the goofy stories she had to tell. I didn't finish the book, and took it back to the library without an ounce of regret. I guess I'll never know if the book gets any better, but I didn't want to keep wasting my time finding out. I found myself to be uninterested, and practically forcing myself to turn the next page.If you like magic stories about a teen girl, I recommend Zenda. It's a fun, detailed series that is better then you might think. And if you really want to try the Genny In A Bottle series, get it from the library first before purchasing."
1,You win some and loose some ..,The fact that James Jennings has his name on this book is about the ONLY good thing. It's another in the old victorian letter series books with Miss Cootes letters ... If I see any more of her serialized letters .. honestly Im gonna vomit ..Save your money and your time my friends ...
2,"Too wordy, insufficient examples, and too little application.","This is not the worst math book out there. Nagle's ""Differential Equations"" is far worse!1. The examples are disconnected from the exercises. After studying the examples you still can't do the exercises.2. There are too few examples. I think most US math books suffer from this problem. Once I studied a book from Singapore. In that book each section has 20-40 examples that gradually build up your skills. They cover all the exercises, too.3. Sometimes an equation is better than 1000 words. This book can get too wordy and confusing at times.For example, section 2.5 is about LU factorisation. LU factorisation is actually pretty easy, but the book makes it very confusing and complicated!Fortunately my linear algebra class was not very hard. I mostly watched videos from Khan Academy and occasionally studied this textbook."
2,Pretty bad,"This book starts out well, but eventually the chapters are too short and don't go far enough in depth on the more advanced topics. This book isn't ideal for any sort of self-study, as it does not contain enough information to thoroughly educate the reader on many of the subjects without some supplementary instruction. Also does not go into any detail on using Mat Lab or any other form of programming to solve linear algebra, which is somewhat essential nowadays. Wouldn't recommend."
4,Good Choice,"When I take a class, I don't have a choice in what book the instructor chooses. If the book is readable, illustrates concepts clearly and helps me study (via useful reference lists, intelligent problems and helpful study guides), then I'm happy. If it does that concisely, like this book did, then I'm stoked. Is this book AMAZING? No. There could have been more and more challenging problems, better pacing, and more or less coverage in several sections. But since any book should be supplemented by a professor's problems and lectures, that should not be necessary. I got everything I needed from the class in which I used Lay's Linear Algebra, and the book carried its weight. I now use it as a handy reference. Very good course book choice."
4,An outstanding introduction to Linear Algebra,"This book provides a good companion for an introductory course in Linear Algebra. Mr. Lay's style is very clear, readable, and each concept logically builds on the last. My only concern is that, like another reviewer said there is the occasional gap between the exercises and the examples presented, which may require the assistance of the instructor. 4/5 Stars"
1,Not especially helpful,"I am an aerospace engineer and used this book during school. I had a very poor professor. Generally if I have trouble learning from a professor the book will get me through it. Unfortuanately this book was very hard to follow and had very few helpful example problems. I ended up dropping the class before it would affect my GPA. I then retook the class over the summer at a local community college, which actually had a much better book that covered all of the same material. I got an A, so it was't just he subject material."
2,NOT A GREAT BOOK,"I got this book because I'm taking linear algebra and it is a required textbook. The book does not explain the material clear, and some of the true or false exercises are very ambiguous, it is not base on the general concepts of linear algebra. for example, true or false: A linear transformation is a special type of function, the superposition principle is a physical description of a linear transformation, etc. if you want to learn the basic theory of linear algebra, choose other books."
5,Great book!!,"David Lay actually has done a wonderful job in writing the book! His style is not quite entertaining but for a ""modern"" book on the subject, it is hot enough to surpass those written by many other math professors. I learned Linear Algebra from his book; but I benefited more from Harold Edwards' Linear Algebra--more straightforward and clear presentation of the subject. Although Edwards' book maybe considered to be a standard on the subject, its not dry--in fact, if you use linear algebra as a tool, you may find it more helpful. Especially if you are studying on your own, you may want to check out Edwards'--complete answers to every problem in the back!! But if you want to understand the subject from a more abstract point of view, Lay's is certainly better. But Gilbert Strang's is the all time applied linear algebra standard."
3,It's the most confusing text I've ever read!,"I try to read the book by myself before the class starts. Yes I do understand what Lay tries to explain at the beginning of the book, but after that (second chapter) he just skipped steps that you are supposed to know by previous chapters and you have to figure out by yourself. In case you dont remember how to do it, you are DONE... Well, average students would have difficult time to understand this textbook..."
3,Ver little help on tough concepts,"This book is an overview of Linear Algebra rather than a comprehensive study. The problems that really dwell deep into the concepts are left unanswered even when the problem is odd. You go to the back of the book and the answer isn't there; instead, it tells you to go to the STUDY GUIDE for the answer. Here's the clincher. You buy a $30 study guide, and then you flip to the correct section and the ANSWER ISN'T THERE. This is a BAD SALES SCHEME. The author claims that giving students answers inhibits critical thinking, but it's clear that he really intends for unwary students to buy his study guide so he can get money without exerting minimum mental effort. I strongly discourage people from buying this book. You'd be better off asking for help on the internet blogs."
2,"Covers all material, terrible terrible exercises, often brief explainations","I've used this book for two university classes. The book covers the material conceptually well, but the exercises are written as though you've masted the material before doing any exercises: basic theorems introduced in the book are not covered in simple exercises, and a high understanding is required to answer even some of the early exercises.The study guide/answers solution guide is not terribly helpful, often giving answers without showing the needed work to get there (often the only reason you're reaching for the study guide in the first place).If you have a choice between two classes, one which uses this book and another which doesn't, take the other class: avoid this book. If you just want to learn linear algebra, there's much better books out there. Avoid this book. Go with another book that doesn't have majorly negative reviews."
1,"Book doesn't teach well, study guide is worse","I picked up this book because I wanted to review linear algebra that I studied years ago. This book has so many holes in the instruction that I could not recall what I learned years ago. The answers in the back of the text were of no help. The study guide was even worse. It would warn me to be careful but not tell me more. It would tell me to re-read a certain paragraph instead of giving me a solution. But the worst part, it does not even have the all the answers. If the author felt you should be able to figure out the answer on your own, he did not put the solution in. A solution manual with only selected odd problems is worthless. The author seems deceitful (bordering on dishonest) to sell the solution manual as such; it doesn't cover anything over and above the text book. If you have a choice, choose a different author for your text book."
1,Apparently not a self-study book,"For those of you who plan to find a self-study material, do not count on this book. I'm a PhD in computer science department and I'm looking for some books to brush my understanding about the linear algebra. I'm looking for ""notions"" instead of ""derivations"". The author does a good job in the first few chapters but I quickly lost after the vector space. I believe that I have some background, though not solid, in linear algebra, but the writing is so dry that I cannot easily follow the flow. I do believe that the author is very knowledgeable. However, as a self-study material, it would be too tough in my opinion.If you are looking for a self-study book that is easy to follow (especially for deep topics). Be prepare that understanding the intuition behind the formula is not well addressed in this book. I won't say it's a 1 star book in the view points of quality. But apparently, you learn nothing if you cannot follow it, right?"
1,One of the worst textbooks I've had the pleasure of using,"This book is awful. Without a teacher this textbook is nonsensical, and even with a teacher the book is so careful not to tell you anything important (because it wants you to do the problems yourself) that you end up not actually understanding the material. The examples are weak and they skip vital steps and explanations so that it is difficult to piece anything together. Found myself looking to other sources to figure stuff out."
1,"illegal sale, not happy",i just tore a sticker off the front of my book and underneath was a notice in red saying that it is illegal to sell this book in any countries other than the ones listed. The US.... was not listed. I was illegally sold this book and now I don't know if I can resell it at the end of the semester.
1,This is not Christmas!,Jane Paulson has no clue of the real meaning of Christmas! This is a load of hogwash. A better name forthe book would be The Commercial Side of Christmas!DO NOT BUY!
1,Cheap & Fragile,Get something else. Falls apart with press fit for the two plastic supports. If you move it or try to remove the bag it's in pieces.
4,With a little engineering product is great!,"The first reviewer was correct. It fell apart. We glued it. It fell apart. We reinforced it top an bottom with string tied around it. This worked a little better, but it still fell apart.We then put sheet metal screws on each leg of all joints. The basket has now worked perfectly for over ten years of tough use.I am now looking for one that is a little taller and narrower to replace the other type I purchased at the same time for a different location.Great laundry basket for the space I needed it, after a little ingenuity!"
4,SMG still has the ideas,"I haven't read anything by Sally Miller Gearhart for literally decades, since the Wanderground , in fact. In The Magister and its preceding volume The Kanshou she has the same literary strengths and weaknesses as The Wanderground- dizzying and utterly engaging philosophical ideas, an extraordinary future vision, deep and wide ethical and spiritual principles and a vision of hope for women and men that is unlike any other I have read. On the not-so-fabulous side? It reads a little like notes for a much bigger book. The characters never quite come to life and the plotting and story cohesion are a bit ragged.Read it for the ideas and the passionate commitment to the most taxing and intelligent ethical beliefs and because after waiting decades for the follow on to Wanderground, why wouldn't you? I can't find any info about volume 3 of this trilogy- anyone know if its been written or published?"
5,"Youth can return, in your mind!","I purchased my first record (a 45) in 1955. I was 8 years old. It was Bill Haley and the Comets playing ""See you later Alligator"". Since that date I have acquired a lot of music on vinyl albums, CDs, DVDs, and a real small collection of audio tapes.I've been in the Data Processing/computer industry since 1965. I find putting music from the Limeliters, 4 Preps, and so many others on my iPod and listening to it at work, keeps me relaxed.All of the 30s, 40, 50, 60s, music is where I'm at. There have been a few artists in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and into the new century that I also like. My iPod has quite a range with it's 1200 songs. I didn't get a larger one because I also listen to the music while riding my Honda Valkyrie motorcycle cruiser. I did a 3600 mile trip in July 2006. The music made the trip even more spacial, special, and feeling, I am a Free Spirit!"
4,Brings back the memories,"The folk songs and singers of the 50s and 60s, what an excellent audio trip back in time. The Limeliters' humor and musical skills are as fresh in this album as they were when I first heard them. Time has, indeed, stood still for their unique presentation."
4,geezer's old loves,"In filling a new I-Pod, I looked for favorite music from happy times. This really fills the bill."
5,Limeliters:Slightly Fabulous Limeliters and Sing Out!,"The quality of the CD was great, better sounds than the original records. I have bought several of these double albums and will buy more. They are a great value."
5,Wonderful,I enjoyed this record as a child growing up during the Sixties. I feel that the Limeliters were on of the greatest folk groups of the era.
3,For kids only!,"""Birth of a Legend/Tale of an Egg"" - maybe the title should have warned me. This is probably a terrific video and very educational if you are between 4 & 8. I personally do not prefer to watch Walter K. cavorting with a classroom full of children (shudder) while reciting appropriate dina-info for this age group. No doubt baby dinosaurs were very cute, but I really didn't feel a need to go on about it - or to watch cute little critter graphics dance about.Warn a person next time about the age level of a video. Luckily I have 8 grandsons, seven of whom are under 6, so I won't have a probelm disposing of it.This video is probably really a 4 or 5, if you are buying it for children. I only gave it a three out of pique.Kemscm"
2,Not Bad,The author referenced the information as advertised but not as completely as I would have liked. Worth the look.
3,"Good book, but began to drag","I am a die-hard basketball fan and read almost anything that has to do with basketball. I have read NBA biographies before this one, and this one wasn't the best. The book started off great. The description of his playing, his injuries, his coaching, all great. But near the end of the book, it began to drag. I remember a lot of that book, but I do not particularly recall much of the ending. The team trainer story was interesting, but other than that, he seemed to be filling pages. This book was way too long. The Grant Hill book (""Change the Game"") was a good book that was short but got to the point. I can recall a decent amount of that book, but it's been awhile since I read it. The Tomjanvich book might be a nice title to pick up, but don't expect too much from it."
2,Not worth the money...,"So, I have had Depression for over 15 years, and on medication for all of it except for 2 pregnancies. I though maybe this would supplement my Wellbutrin...not even close. It did nothing for me. SOMETHING THEY DON'T MENTION: the recommended dosage is 2-4 capsules twice a day. So, since I was not going to take 8 of those a day at that price, that could by why it did not work. If you are having mild to moderate depression problems, I recommend ChromaxChromax 500 Mcg With Ultra Strength Chromium Picolinate - 60 Capsulesat 1 a day for 7.99...way better value and so totally worked for me; I am more relaxed-things don't upset me as much as always, my 9 year old says it has really helped. So, unless you have money to burn, you might want to try something else first."
1,"Absolute Garbage, Don't waste your Money","I have been on prescribed depression meds and I really wanted to stop them, I chose to wean myself off but I needed some help, I looked all over the net and came across Deprex. I was leary because the internet is full of SNAKE OIL SALESMEN, well, this one was no different. It does not work, the claims of this product are ludicrous. Do Not Waste Your Money. Someone is getting rich off of others, don't help them out."
3,Not quite as good as their other album,"I had the ""East Village Opera Company"" album, and loved it and wanted more from these artists. I guess this was an earlier release. It's them all right, and good, it's just that I feel their instrumental arrangements got better in the later album. So, I'm glad I got it, for ""completeness"" of my collection, but if you just wanted a little of this genre in your collection, I'd have to recommend the other album as being the better investment."
3,What if the B-52's...,"...wore bunny suits? Well, that'd be Gram Rabbit. In fact, if you like the B-52's (and who doesn't?) then you're sure to find this group appealing.When I first heard of them--and the whole bunny cult ""joke""--I assumed it'd wear thin pretty quickly, however it was just the opposite. True, the whole bunny suit thing is admittedly silly, but this band really delivers some astonishingly diverse and well-crafted music. Sometimes dancey, sometimes spookey. Spookey Dancey even.This, their second album, is more spacey and atmospheric than their first. I like them both, but this one took me awhile to get into (except for the immediately catchy ""Bloody Bunnies"", which is the most B-52's-ish song I've ever heard that was not by the B-52's.)Great music for that road trip you always wanted to take to Area 51."
4,Rabbits go a-playing,Gram Rabbits second CD is just as original as the first and continues to expand your musical horizons!
3,Unfortunate Letdown,"After the little slice of awesome that was their first album (Music to Start a Cult To), Gram Rabbit's sophmore effort seems somewhat disappointing. If I were to express what's wrong with this album as succinctly as possible, I'd go with ""over-produced."" Instead of further refining their unique sound (southwestern burlesque rock?), they've traded it off for too much synth, strings, and sound effects. That's not to say the album's an entire loss; there are still some bright spots. You can check out one of my favorite tracks, ""Bloody Bunnies,"" on their MySpace page. Ultimately, I'd classify this one as ""recommended with reservations."""
4,Compared to not having recordings...,"IMHO...The dialogues are re-produced verbatim, they allow you to read the dialogues as you listen, immensely helpful in learning to read Chinese script.There are lots of books out there with no sound files available or where the sound files don't match the text.These are quite good in that respect.The other criticisms may be accurate but the book is greatly enhanced by this cd.this is a good investment for a beginning student, without it I would have been lost in the class I took."
2,difficult to find tracks,"This produci i am not very found of, a lot of english words everywhere like telling chapters and stuff and there is no software helping to find the right tracks. very oldfashion."
4,Great Bandsaw for the Money,"This bandsaw will do everything you want and more. The main thing that could make it better is add a 3 hp motor for serious resaw work. The quality of the resaw work that I have done using cedar so far is perfect tracking with very little drift and plenty of power. However, I suspect if I resawed oak the saw may lack the power to saw a an economical pace. ( I'll edit this after I actually resaw some oak.)The reason I only voted 4 stars is because the plastic insert at the rail opposite the locking cam on the fence fell out after a few uses. That could be fixed if they used an alternate method to attach it instead of the self adhesive."
4,Wicked loving lies,"Again, Rosemary Rogers writes a book that will not allow you to put it down easily once started. This book, as usual, combines several different mysteries that all tie together in the end,"
3,Interesting!,"I borrowed this book from a friend and never gave it back (mainly because she moved away) I was about thirteen and just beginning my foray into adult literature.I've read some of the other reviews and more than one person mentioned being disturbed by the ""rape"" segments in the book.If you've read the book you must try and remember that in this time period women were still pretty much considered property and had little or no rights. As a modern woman I too find it distasteful but I feel it was a necessary part of the story as it helped set the tone of that era.The plot meandered quite a bit at times but it did have its reedeming points.Marissa despite her travails was a very courageous young woman who dared to break rules and found a strength she didn't know she had.The hero is not lovable and perhaps he's not meant to be but it was an engaging story that effectively took me to that magical place where the written word comes alive."
2,Just like a soap opera,"I have to admit this novel has a different ryhthm than any other romance novels I have read. It changes settings constantly and reminds me of a soap opera. It surprises me how Domenic and Marisa can't defend their acts and keep hating each other but at the same time having very intense love scenes. For me that is not logical. Also I was wondering by the end of the novel how the author was going to redeem Dominc in Marisa's eyes and it happened very fast and poorly convincing at the end of the book. If you like to read romance novels, I recommend that you try it as an example of a style that was revolutionary in the '70s."
1,This book was a chore to read.,"I forced myself to finish this book thinking the ending would be redeeming. I cannot bring myself to like either the ""hero"" or ""heroine"". I love historical romance, but severely disliked this book. If you are looking for a good historical love story, check out Stormfire by Christine Monson."
1,Frightening in Depiction of Rape as Love,"This book was incredibly disturbing to me...it consisted of aseries of events during which the ""heroine"" was raped,sodomized, branded, whipped, and enslaved, before realizing she was ""in love"" with the man who raped her first, last, and most often. I can't tell you how much it frightens me that this series of events is published under the name of ""romance""."
2,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a sequel to the book Sweet Savage Love, and there are 3 more books that follow this one.I have read them all but the last one about their kids, and I still don't know why I did it. These are probably the most STRESSFUL and disturbing books I have ever read. I absolutely HATED the main characters. Steve is the worst hero of any book ever, and Ginny is the biggest (...)of any character or any person I have ever read or met in my life. The list of misfortune of these people is insurmountable, and highly unlikely. Rape was a main staple in these books, and not my idea of erotica or fun. It was distasteful. I guess I just kept reading the sequels hoping they would get better, but they did not. Ginny and Steve are by far the worst parents on earth, and the most unlikeable people, IMO."
2,Just too much,"As a young adult, I enjoyed Rosemary Rogers books, and when I saw this book in the library, I realized I had never read it. I was very disappointed and no longer understand what I enjoyed in her books. As mentioned in other reviews, rape was just too common a theme in this story. I don't find that to be an escapist theme, I find it distasteful. By the time I got to the part where Marisa becomes a slave, I had to put the book down and just shake my head. It was like reading a soap opera...something I've never enjoyed. I did finish the book, but I think from now on, I will stick to authors I currently enjoy, such as Julia Quinn and Nicole Jordan."
1,Why was this Published???,"I can honestly say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. it was incredibly offensive, the characters were completely unlikeable, and the story simply rambled on for pages and pages. The heroine ( I use the term loosely ) is repeatedly raped and abused by the hero ( again, used loosely), and you never get the sense that this is anything but a very abusive, unhealthy relationship. I would absolutely not want this book around where a young, impressionable teenage girl could get her hands on it and think that this is what romance and sex are supposed to be. These two characters should be transported forward in time so that they could be guests on the Jerry Springer show. I can't believe that Rosemary Rogers or her publisher would consider this to be a romance novel! I'm so glad that this was not my first Rosemary Rogers novel, because it defintely would have been my last!"
5,A must for every Deep Purple fan,A very interesting review of what the life behind the scenes was during the MK IV era. Very impressive interviews with Jon Lord and Glenn Hughes and incredible stories revealed. For all Tommy Bolin's fan nice live takes of him playing.I'm personally very impressed.
5,I could feel the suspense,"Rich Ryall has done a marvelous job recounting the experience of a true baseball fan through a Season, Penant Race, and World Series. I could feel the anxieties, the frustrations, and the elations that such a fan experiences, but more importantly, Ryall has the ability to make every reader understand a fan's love of the game. He has a charming and intelligent wit that all will enjoy, baseball fan or not."
1,Read something else by Hal Clement,"The style in ""Fossil"" is totally different to other books by Hal Clement. Much too wordy, repetitive and boring. I got the impression that he might be trying to imitate Asimov's style -- which I'm not fond of, but of course opinions may differ on that. For a good book by Hal Clement, try his excellent ""Mission of Gravity"", or ""Close to critical"" instead."
1,go to a professional!,"all tattooing ,whether it be makeup or an actual tattoo should be done in a clean sterile environment..not your bathroom!!"
4,Fun education game about animals,"My children (7 and 5) have a good time playing this game. The DVD shows footage of animals (including many obscure ones), and then asks a question. The questions are scaled to the age of the player. They learn interesting bits of trivia, and find the animal lore so interesting that they don't even mind losing.The game requires using the DVD remote to answer and advance the game, so at this age an adult is required."
4,Satisfied,"Pan is great, well made cooks things evenly and well. My only complaint about the product is the label - it's stuck right in the middle of the cooking surface and the glue took FOREVER to remove. I can't use a pan when it's got a big smear of glue right in the middle. I had to soak it in hot water and soap, scrub it, soak some more, scrub again. Other than the glue issue, great pan. Just very poor label application and placement."
5,Great baking pan,"Stainless steel is the true non-stick. This baking pan is heavy gauge and perfect for those square items, such as brownies. We will pick up a few more."
5,Great!,"It bakes well, and still looks new everytime I pull it from the dishwasher. I like the heaviness of it compared to aluminum."
4,I Love This Pan,Clean up is a snap--comes sparkling clean with just soap and water. I love this pan and the only thing negative I can say is that I wish it were a bit deeper--it's a little on the shallow side.
2,SS cake pan,Even tho it says 8 inches.... My revereware pan is 8 inches and larger. I got it for my son and was disappointed in the skimpy size and felt it was really thin. It does not compare well with my Revere ware pan which I could not find one like anywhere so settled for this one!
3,Tough but tiny,"This is a tough little pan. I love the thickness and rigidness of the stainless, but it's a tad tiny. Where it says it is 8 inch, that is from the outside of the pan, lip-to-lip. The interrior is more like 6.5 inches,and very shallow. I wanted this to make Lazagnia in my countertop oven, but all I'll get is Lazagnia for two with as tiny as this is. Fortunately there's only two of us here to eat Lazagnia but I do love leftovers too, and that's not going to happen it seems. It might fit like 4 biscuits or two pieces of chicken. It is a GREAT personal bake pan, but don't believe that it's really 8 inches."
3,Too small,"The pan itself is nice and heavy, but I was expecting it to be 8 inches insideof the pan, instead it is slightly over 7 1/2 at top of pan and it tapers offto about 7 inches at bottom. Very disappointed that the company that sells thisproduct does not include this detail in the measurement of the pan.Don't think I will order from Norpro again because of this."
5,Norpro is quality bakeware.,Perfect size for many recipies. It's great! I love being able to put it in the dishwasher to clean it too.
2,"SUPER small - not even close to 8""","This is actually a very nice pan, but the size is completely off. More like 7"" of usable space. Hence, I'm returning it."
4,"Working at the Car Wash!,","Enjoy your very own hair follicles and sputum within the confines of your own home. Tired of using other spas which have grease marks and strange substances floating within them? Well then, try this portable spa! Fits right inside your living room and all it needs is 900 gallons of water. Be careful with needles and sharp objects and do not use around electrical appliances or battery operated hand-saws."
3,Alvino Rey and his Orchestra,"Alvino Rey had a very good band,and had some very fine instrumentalists,as well as singers:however he played an electric guitar,which was a featured instrument,because he was the leader and could do what he wanted to do.Personally, I didn't care for the guitar solos,which interrupted the general flow of the music.You might like them,I didn't."
4,Awsome LCD display to share photos with friends,"When you buy a digital camera one of the great things is to be able to judge and share your result immediately. This is the best camera I have seen to do this so far. With more than 200,000 pixels on the display, and a size of 2.5"" it is far above any other camera I have seen. Movie shooting is also a very nice feature."
5,Chaos theory for the rest of us,"As an applied social scientist with an interest in dynamical systems theory, this book was a revelation to me--technically accurate without being overwhelmingly technical. One of the two best introductions to dynamical systems for those of us who are involved in this area of research but forgot to major in math as undergrads. (The other one that I recommed, by the way, is Kaplan and Glass's work Understanding Nonlinear Dynamics.)"
5,The best!,This is the most understandable book in chaos theory I have read. It clearly explains the theory and the tools to understand it. I have read several books and papers but this is the one I like the most. If you are interested in Chaos theory try this book first and then read other technical stuff.
4,Good general overview.,"This book appeals to a quite broad audience, since deep technical matters are kept to a minimum. In general is well written. However, I would prefer to see more illustrations. I couldn't find any major errors except at page 312 and 313, where Mr. Williams claims that ""...a ruler of length zero doesn't exist. Even if it did, the measured coastline then would be infinitely long"". The statement is regarding the measurement of the length of a certain coastline using a ruler of diminishing length, the outcome must of course, be expressed in terms of a limit. As the length of the ruler goes toward zero, the total length will not go to infinity, since for higher and higher resolution, the line connecting two points becomes straight, and the measured distance will converge toward the true length of the coastline, whatever that finite number is."
1,Requires detailed understanding of mathematics,Do not order this book unless you have a strong mathematics background. The entire book hinges upon mathematical argument.
2,"Get in print, not Kindle","This is an excellent book in print. As a Kindle book, no. The conversion process has converted all subscripts and superscripts to regular type, and all Greek and math symbols to english text. Inserted formulas are so small they are only legible when magnified. Buy the paper edition."
3,The design its not as good as it should be,When you start sweating it lets your sweat filter through the sponge and it boders when you are doing any sport
3,nose guard,Great product and served a great purpose. Very durable and actually protected my sons broken nose when he go hit in the face with the ball.....little hard to see out of and causes him to have difficulty seeing and his depth perception is off.
2,Mueller Nose Guard,Not very useful for basketball due to the blocked vision. Bounce passes and scrambles for ball on court was very difficult. Would not recommend this product.
4,Good Service,"I bought this item for my teenage son who recently broke his nose. The Company was great. Shipped fast. Unfortunately, my son was unable to use the product and I had to return it. The refund took a bit longer than I anticipated, but it did happen. Again, good service."
3,good product for the price,My son broke his nose last month during a soccer game. We had it reset and he was allowed to go back to play as long as he wore a nosegaurd. We purchased the Mueller nose guard and he has been wearing it for the past month. It has worked quite well. This nose gaurd is a good product for the price. The only negative is some sight limitations while wearing it.
2,"Gripping plot, but...","...the writing is not the best. The author is a Washington lawyer, and has not yet mastered fiction writing. But it's a pretty good read anyway."
4,Book review,"Fast service from book store. So thank you for that!However, the book itself was a let down. It was reviewed favorably by publisher, but i thought the book - a collection of essays about my favorite subject (botany)- was a bit boring. It could have been a show stopper of essays written in vivid prose, but instead it just left me flat and uninspired."
2,Disappointed by this collection,"This seemed like a book that was hastily done for the sake of being a gift book. I think many people who know Jamaica Kincaid's work (and love of horticulture) would be interested in reading this collection. I felt that the collection was uneven, repetitive, and really did not uncover anything new or special. It seemed like a forced set of writings from a melange of different authors."
4,The culmination of the hottest angle of the summer,"It was the PPV where all the things had to be settled: which champion between CM Punk and John Cena can be called legitimate ? Well, you would get really amazed by the surprising outcome of this war"
4,What a show!,"The Pay Per View was one of the best of the year. It was also in my opinion one of the greatest Summerslam's of all time. The only complaint as usual are the lack of Extras on the DVD. If you like WWE and did not buy the Pay Per View, I'd buy the DVD."
3,Good Primer,"Only contains excerpts of major works by Sigrid UndsetKristin Lavransdatter: (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition), for instance. Halfway through the excerpt they presented, an entire page is bereft of text! and the story picks up a page later, leaving you hanging about what just happened. So it is a good set for introducing you to who won what and when, but you have to seek out the complete works somewhere else if you like what you read in these compendiums."
5,"Highly recommended, very rewarding.","Building A Life Of Value was definately a great addition to my collection of life inspiring works. In recent times, I had been faced with some difficult challanges to my belief system. In taking a few personal improvement days, I reviewed Merchey's guide to values, and Steven Covey's work on maintaining Focus, and slowly but effectively developed a clear understanding of the values that where guiding me. I am back on track now and owe much to this body of inspiration. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking at their life's journey and taking ownership of it's direction."
1,"Women's Magna 26"" West Coast Cruiser","Bike frame seemed small. Bike fenders got bent inside box during shipping and decals appeared to be cheaply applied and were peeling off. Overall, I was very dissatisfied with the bike."
3,Expecting More,"Sal Sr. was a wiseguy who wanted to have things both ways. He wanted to be the tough talking wiseguy who made good on a life of crime and the father standing on the sidelines getting credit for his kid's accomplishments. I'm not one for the witness protection program for thugs but this story makes the reader see why the program is important. When there's a family behind the criminal and that family needs protection, it's not such a bad thing. If anything, the author accomplished a true vision of what families entering the WPP face.In Sins of the Father, the average person sees what the children of such 'mob guys' go through and that aspect was captured and relayed well. The writing often ran together and I don't recommend placing this book on the bedside table. It's far too complicated to follow when you're reading yourself to sleep. The only thing you might accomplish is trying to follow the sudden and abrupt POV shifts."
4,"Incisive, fascinating",Prof Herman does a wonderful job tying the disparate threads of various ethnic riots. He does not pander or oversimplify. Highly recommended for students of the field.
5,Hidden History!!,"The first reviewer obviously is not interested in the truth, just the usual ad-hominem attacks, name-calling, and distractions. He offers no facts or data to back up his claims about Jews ""sneaking out the back door"" or the reason for them being brought to the camps.Science and historical revisionism have torn the myth of the Holocaust apart. The ""eyewitness accounts"" and wild made-up stories just don't jive with the scientific facts and data. If these authors and scientists are so full of hot air, why does Germany deport, harass, and arrest people who just have questions about the holocaust??!!!"
4,Surprised,"I've heard a lot of both negative and positive views on this band. Wasn't really sure what to think, so I decided to just take the risk and purchase it. I was quite surprised when i began listening. There is not anything extremely different or special about these guys compared to the other million metalcore acts out today... BUT for some reason, i really like them. I don't know what it is. If your looking for something totally out of the ordinary, then i recommend you skip this band and go buy something like Psyopus (which are also very good). Yet if your looking for catchy songs with decent guitar/drum work and good lyrics, I'd go and buy it."
1,This is not the TRUE Esoteric,"This band is a joke, and obviously knows nothing of extreme music; for if they did they'd know this band name was already taken. This band is unaware of Esoteric from the U.K.; who play an ominous brand of abstract Doom. Don't be fooled by these morons who are undeserving of the name from which they stole from a greater act. If you're a fan of this band, I wouldn't recommend checking out the real Esoteric. Lest you would be driven insane by sounds that emanate from the alternate shadowy plane of existence."
2,"Looks good, but not easy on your feet","Good looking mules, but leaves blisters on your feet. I have owned better quality shoes from Clarks"
2,Its average,"""No Mercy"" for the N64 is the best wrestling game ever made and this one isn't half the game ""No Mercy"" is. This new ""Showdown: Legends of Wrestling"" is way overrated. After reading so many positive reviews about it, I thought they finally got it right. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Its worth renting for the sake of having King Kong Bundy do a body splash onto Bobby Heenan from the top of a steel cage in Madison Square Garden, but I wouldn't buy it."
1,Lame,They don't tell you that you need some kind of an older version of XBox in order for this game to work. Total waste!
3,Mocha Mugs,"These mugs are fine. The finish isn't fabulous, the seam from the molding process produces a ridge that makes them look a little cheap."
1,"heavy, awkward","These mugs are so heavy due to thick bottom, and the handle only fits two fingers, so difficult to hold with one hand when full. Also, inside of handle has a rough edge and is very annoying. There was no effort to smooth the seams; how hard could that be? Sad to see such poor quality from an American manufacturer"
1,worst cups I ever saw,"these cups are defective.There are seams in the handle of these cups that make it very uncomfortable to hold them, both in the loop & underneath, they dig into my fingers, the last thing I want to do is return breakable glass items but I can't use these so I have returned them. I am sorry I didn't listen to the reviews on these."
1,Nice but....It's a miss...,"Very nice simple design, packed well, good value however there are seams on the handles that cause great discomfort when holding the mug. Too bad, would have been nice. We already tossed the packaging. Not a great loss. We will donate and buy another on Amazon."
3,Unwieldy and a bit crude,"Remarkably heavy, with a small, poorly shaped handle. Looks crudely made. We gave them to our cleaning lady, who seemed pleased."
4,Sturdy and Attractive,These are very sturdy and attractive mugs at a decent price. My only complaint is the size and shape of the handle which is smaller than a normal coffee mug handle and doesn't allow you to get your fingers in properly for a good grip.
3,Nice Looking Mug,I had two glass mugs and wanted a set. These looked pretty much the same. I will say that the ridge of glass where the two pieces are put together on several of the mugs is prominent and can be uncomfortable and this is the reason that I took off two stars. They are nice looking mugs and when you make a latte or special coffee it does look nice. I don't know if the ridge will eventually wear down or if it is just a matter of holding it in a different way. I didn't send them back but probably wouldn't buy them again.
3,poor packaging,"Item arrive in a used box without protection with one cup smashed, totally amateur, not worth time and money to return"
2,Great possiblities overshadowed by excessive use of language,"Shale Aaron starts out with a great storyline, but it gets buryied in an odd attempt to set a trend in his writing style. Some scenes are painted with too powerful of words making the book a confusing and laborous read. If you want a unique read... this book is for you."
2,"Hmmmm,gills?","Not a bad start. It was ok when Capt. Fuller escaped an incredible assasination attempt, but when the guy with the gills showed up....This bookshould be under science fiction."
3,"Not bad, not spectacular","This is one book of a series using the same basic individuals. The action is good and well written however in my opinion it is overdone and therefore not realistic. A lot of repetitive actions become boreing after a while. If you read the whole series, to me, it becomes a bit too much."
2,Sorry to See Rudimentary Mistakes!,"Although I am new to Access 97, I was horrified to see the number of mistakes the author made in terms of correct database design. I found that most of his sample dbs often violated the first normal form. Is this what a new user should learn?"
5,Not for Beginners,"If your looking for a way to begin using Microsoft Access 97 this book is not for you. A better route would be Microsoft's Access 97 Step-by-Step. The step-by-step series is a good place to start learning the fundamentals of Access 97. Even though Running Microsoft Access 97 begins with some of the basics, this book is taylored for the individual with more experience. I am a database management major and understand that this book can be a little dry and drag a bit for those who are just beginning. I've been there."
1,Very difficult to read,"The first feeling after reading it is that the layout, fonts of the contents are very poor.Also, the examples are not useful enough and it makes the readers hard to understand the concepts. Most of the graphics do not help the readers know what the author is explaining.It has too many concepts but do not contain steps for the readers to follow. If you want a book which is user-friendly, look for other books. The publisher should illustrate the steps in points-form, not in big blocks of paragraph. Learning Access should have clear steps to follow, even the advanced skills like the Form, Report or Macro programming.Don't trust the ad 'Who know more than Microsoft'!"
2,There must be a better Access book out there,"He doesn't really explain how things *really* work, just a lot of step-by-step examples, which lack explanations of what's going on. A lot of the basic information is here, but there is so much text and so many words that it's a lot of work to dig it out.I was reading it while commuting back and forth to work on the train and always felt confused at the end of my commute.No doubt a reasonable book for people who don't feel guilty saying, ""Hey, at least it works."""
2,For beginners only...,"Well... If you are looking for real answers and usefull examples, if you are looking for code examples on how to solve real, problems concearning MS Jet database engine or, on other words, if you're a programmer... RUN! Don't buy this book unless you want to buy an expensive doorstop. On the other hand, if you're an absolute beginner who wants to learn the basic steps of making a simple database application to solve some domestic problem you may consider to buy it. My 2 stars are for those."
5,A Remarkable Resource,"Helen Sloan Daniels, born 1899, was an amateur archeologist with loads of practical experience, a philanthropist, and a local expert in all things Anasazi. This 52 page pamphlet, with over 25 illustrations uses primary and secondary sources to capture the Falls Creek Anasazi site and the history of excavations there.Daniels provides details of archeological explorations from the late 19th century up to 1975, with a particular emphasis on some of the important mummy finds and petroglyphs. She brings all sorts of interesting sources to the table, ranging from notes made by individual archeologists, newspaper articles, magazine articles, and even a couple of paragraphs from Ernie Pyle.Stapled wraps, 28 short chapters, index, and 2 page Bibliography."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful Christmas CD!!","My dad would always play Walter Brennan's Christmas album at Christmas time when I was a youngster. I actually enjoyed it then because I could see on my dad's face how much he felt and relived life as he listened. I've looked for it for years and haven't been able to find it till now. Listening to it again after all these years brought a coupla tears and many smiles to my face as Mr Brennan tells us about a simpler, happier time in the world where being a family is the most important thing at Christmas time."
5,Better for me,"Old Rivers is much better on this CD than the 78 I was listening to before. I enjoy the way Mr. Brennan talks about an older time. My father was a dirt farmer and used horses to plow the twenty acres on their farm in Minnesota. I gave the CD to my aunt she is 75 now and still farming. She said she got weepy eyed when she listened to it. She still lives on the old farm and said she could almost see her dad out there in the field. To me this CD is more than just a few songs / words, its a lot of wonderful memories. Thank you Walter Brennen for making this."
2,Shelby Collectables GT-500 Flaws in this Color,"This is a ok diecast but it has a huge flaw. The red color is multicolored. Some shades of red on the car are diffrent colors of red. The body is darker than the doors, hood, and trunk. In short buy the Auto Art version of this car it will save you alot of eye ache and wallet ache as well. Given the Auto Art cost more but in the end it is worth it."
3,"Keep your wallet open, you'll need it!","I don't have a problem with the way Zonealarm functions. It seems to work fine after some minor configuring. I won't access the internet without it. But a month after I bought Zonealarm 2 (download from their web site), they started bugging me to upgrade to version 3. I was annoyed that they didn't sell me version 3 to begin with but finally agreed. About a year later, my ""subscription"" to updates expired and now I get occasional pop-up windows, asking me to renew. My advice is to use the shareware version. They still bug you for money but at least you aren't paying them to bug you."
3,Arguably not for high-end XP/Win2K domain environments,"I've never found a version of ZoneAlarm which worked with my XP/Win2K domain environment. I use IPSec/Kerberos, two factor authentication, & various other msft goodies. ZoneAlarm probably works well with some vanilla systems (it used to work for me under Win95 back in the old days), but assuredly does not work with my systems today. One of those 'set your expectations accordingly for a $30 product' issues. Download it for free & try it before buying it. If you feel you have something of value to protect & can afford it, buy a real hardware firewall (i.e., the Cisco PIX 501)."
3,Customer Service stinks,"I purchased ZAPro in April of 02 and for some reason my 12 months subscription has expired. I don't know why this happened. I have emailed the ZA people four times about this problem, but I don't get any response.Program seems to work great! But, you are more than likely not going to get much help for the service techs at Broderbund.I will change to another program in a few months if I don't hear soon from ZAPro."
1,NO! DO NOT USE ZONE ALARM!,"It used to be a good program but starting with 6.0.667 something went terribly wrong. View reviews at download.com and on the Zone Alarm sites Forums page, where hundreds of mad users are begging for help. I complained and ZA ERASED my comments!I loaded the most recent upgrade and ended up with my business closed for over a week, and $1,000 in tech service bills."
1,"Zone Alarm, what a pain","This damned programme infiltrates your system, creates endless log files and is a total bitch to get rid of. It sticks in msconfig and can you hell as like uncheck the box, even when you have supposedly uninstalled it. It is there, lurking, causing endless conflicts. Use Sygate personal firewall, it works. Be ashamed Zone Labs, fax you, pay you premium rates for a techy with my VISA, the hell I will. Just tell the general folks how to delete the thing."
5,Every one needs a firewall!,"This was the easiest to install in my system. It alerts you of everything that is ""tapping"" your system. You can set the variances of ""alerts"". I first got this a free download,orginally called Innocolate Firewall. It has a very good sitefor questions or to reach a tech. Have you ever had a hardtime reaching or asking a question on a site?? Well, no more""ask Sammy"" Everything is nice self explanatory. Rememberthere are people, even as I write this article, that are viewingme,STOP THE HACKER!!!!This was about 29.95 ,and well worth it.Dont worry ,if your are asking if you can update this,you can its easy!"
3,Do you really need this version?,"ZoneAlarm is one of the best firewall programs on the market. Compared to Norton it was unbelievable how many intrusions were caught. It works seamlessly and rarely messes up new installs or access to web sites.Of course it depends on how you are going to set up ZoneAlarm.As for the Pro version I agree with other reviewers, you do not get a lot more for the money and although I want to see these developers do well I can't see the need to purchase to more expansive package. Also, several of my friends warned me to pass on this version as they had problems with unexplained shut downs and difficulty disabling ZoneAlarm Pro 3. In fact, both went back to the free version.Between ZoneAlarm and the (free) AVG anti-virus software except for automation there is no need for the commercial versions other than business licenses and more control. For home and casual users it's not worth the possible intrusions."
5,It's the Best,So they say. How would I know? I installed it and it has never caused a problem using Win 98se. It is supposed to be the best firewall software going.
1,"Sounded good, BUT...","I'd heard a LOT of good things about ZoneAlarm, especial on Tech TV. So when it came time to renew my Norton Personal Firewall, I decided to purchase the latest ZoneAlarm instead. BIG MISTAKE. I found it VERY dificult to set up and use, And I found the manual and help files to be of NO help.I advise anyone looking for a software Firewall to look into Norton Personal Firewall. It's MUCH easier to set up and use, with MUCH better customer support."
4,Here Come the Indy's,"Well, I am changing my review because the sad news is that Name Taken has retired to go do other things. That's too bad, but after reading their announcement, I can understand that they were tired of living out of a van and wanting to go be successful in more traditional ways. Best of luck to them. In the meantime, they left us a really good CD."
5,Amazingly Frantastic,If you have not picked up this cd you are definatly missing out. This is the best cd I've bought in a while. This is definatly up there with all the great pop punk/emo or whatever you wanna call it. Definatly pick up this cd you will not regret it!
2,Jigs without the Plans,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. It does have a lot of information and pictures and does describe how to use the jigs. However, there are very few actual detail drawings of the jigs. There is usually a general drawing, but that is about it. I suppose if you are an experienced wood worker, then that may be all you need. But for the beginner, there is not enough detail information to build many of the jigs or accessories. If you are looking for router jigs and tools, I highly recommend ""Router Magic"" by Bill Hylton. Router Magic is an excellent book with lots of detail drawings and bill of materials."
2,"No plans, no dimensional drawings",Nice photos and descriptions. The book is lacking any detailed information on building any of the devices in the book. There are no material lists or detailed drawings.
2,Not top pick,"Although interesting, my advice is to get Sandor's book instead. I have both, and I use Sandor's more often...not just for his jigs, but for ideas on designing my own."
1,A total Ripoff!!,I paid for a whole year's subscription but was luck to get 1/2 the magazines. I even contacted the publisher and no one could ever get the mess cleaned up.
3,more than I need,The scale is very nice I just didn't realize that it is a dietary scale and most of the preprogramed food is from another country. All I really needed was a scale for baking. I got that and more.
5,Two of Tom Hanks` best comedies,"If The Burbs doesn`t become a comedy classic there is no justice in the world.The best comedy is real life exaggerated. And while this is VERY exaggerated anyone who has ever experienced suburban or small townliving will see just a little of theirselves and their neighbors in this film. From the wild rumors, to the neighbor`s nutty ideas,to the urban legends, to neighbors spying on each other. It`s all here with comic results.By the same token, The Money Pit is the nightmare of anyone who has ever undertaken a major home improvement, or hired a contractorfor a major job. While the Money Pit isn`t as good as The Burbs, it is a very funny comedy in its own right and very under rated.Tom Hanks is an excellent actor. And his performances in both of these films are excellent."
3,Great collection BUT get The Tom Hanks Comedy Favorites Collection instead!,"Okay these ARE two great films BUT you can get The Tom Hanks Comedy Favorites Collection instaed for less green AND it comes these two films PLUS Dragnet as well,so save money and get Universal's The Tom Hanks Comedy Favorites Collection instead! You get 3 great films for LESS than you would have paid for this one with only two films!!!"
2,Stay away!,"Movie quality was horrible, it was fuzzy, it skipped and the sound was all over the place. I wish I would have watched it sooner so I could have returned it"
4,Written by a Nick Fan,"I'm going to make this short. A: I'm a big fan of Nick Bantock... I love the artwork - it's captivating. These are books I can look at again and again.This being said, I loved the first three books with all my heart. I liked the fourth and fifth... I was sorely disappointed with the end - I feel Nick didn't wrap up the characters very neatly, and kind of threw away a very compelling tale.Are the books worth reading? Yes. Are they beautiful? Yes. Will I recommend all six to my friends? Seriously - I'll probably give them the first three... If they demand it, I'll give the second three with the stipulation that they prepare for a letdown in book six..."
1,"a tad PRICEY, perhaps...?","I like the Far Side, but I refuse to pay 417 dollars for it. What IS this?!?"
5,Trip Around the World,I lost my copy of the pattern. I was happy to find a mint condition copy for a reasonable price.
4,Trip Around the World,Eleanor Burns clearly describes how to make this quilt. She is good and I like the way it is quick to make.
3,A Review for Married Men,"If I sound sexist I apologise in advance. This is the third Tejada novel in the series but the second one I've read.I found this to be an excellent historical mystery, with great atmosphere and narrative. However: Did you enjoy ""The Constant Gardener""? If you found that book/movie a little irritating you are going to get a little frustrated with his wife Elena.She nags and nags!!!! I mean gimme a break! We're talking about the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and Tejada is a Guardia officer! Cut the guy some slack. Plus Tejada seems to have gone a little soft. Nothing like the tough man of his times as in ""Death of a Nationalist"". I found that a little disappointing.That said I'll stick with this series."
4,good info on generations in the workplace,"This is probably your best bet for a book on generations in the workplace. It's not long on data, but it does apply knowledge about generations in a very useful way. It's not a deep treatment, but it gets the job done. A fairly quick read, and good if you just want to understand people of different ages in the workplace.If you are interested in learning more about generations overall, and applying the knowledge yourself (easy to do), there's the classic (_Generations_ by Strauss & Howe, strong on theory and the overall picture, though outdated with its 1991 pub date) or the more recent _Generation Me_, with data on how the generations differ psychologically."
1,Has the potential...but not quite there,"There are currently 4 generations in the workplace and this book almost completely ignores the 4th and newest on of all - Millenials. It mentions them at the start, but that's about it. Many organizations are currently trying to figure out the newest generation and I thought this book would give insight to that and help us figure out how to have ALL 4 generations work with each other, not just 3. Another thing...it uses the series drama ER as a reference point...I'd prefer some real life work examples rather than use a show I never saw as a reference point. This is not worth the purchase. You can get all their information by just looking it all up on the wiki."
1,How in the world,If I ever saw this Starbird I would shoot him down. This book was nothing but half-baked ideas thrown together to make 481 pages of garbage. How was this book ever published? My advice is to stop writting and join the circus.
2,It's okay,"Probably not as hi tech as the newer digital cameras. This one does an okay job for the megapixels it has to work with. The problem is because it has only two buttons on top, you have to toggle through the button to get to delete photos, etc. IT's a little too complicated for my 5 year old (the age group who likes barbies). It's built well though and comes with the instructions and cables. SO, if you can explain how to use it to your child and they understand, it's a good product."
1,Save your money,This camera is a major rip-off. There's no viewer so my granddaughter couldn't see what she was taking the photo of. We sent it back and just bought her a cheap little digital camera. She's happy as a lark now.
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This is a waste of money. your basically buying a piece of plastic shaped as a camera. The software won't work. my daughter loved it until she found out she won't ever be able to see the pictures she took.
3,kids digital camera,We bought this camera since it was less expensive than other digital cameras that have a theme like Tinkerbell or Hannah Montana. Its nice and not too small and our daughter likes to take pictures. The only drawback is that there is no lcd preview screen on the back so she is not sure whether or not its a toy or real. We haven't downloaded her pics yet but I am sure that won't be a problem. I would opt for the slightly more expensive version that has the lcd display.
5,Awesome Series!,"This is such a great series! This is the third book in the amazing Replica series about Amy, a twelve-year-old girl who finds out she is a clone. This book continues with Amy on the path to self discovery, finding out what she is and how to deal with it. A must read for Replica fans and a great series to get into!"
5,Another One.................................,"Ever Since Amy saw one of her clones at a ballet she has been dying to actually meet one...One day when she was going to meet Erik at shcool she sees a fyler in the office about a film being made at parkside middle school!Well,when she tells Tasha about it,Tasha becomes determind to interview some of the Stars...So,Amy decides to go with her,just for fun...But in one of the traillers They find something they never expected - Another Amy..........Amy expects that they will have identical personalities,but she's wrong - the other Amy wants to grab the Spotlight,and she does NOT want a look-alike.And she will do almost anything to get Amy out of the way....She's Evil!Amy must stop her,before the organization does.............This is another great Replica book!I loved this book,its one of my favorites!This is a must-buy for Replica fans!Hope this was Helpful to you!"
4,This book was great!,"I really liked this book, but it would definitely have been better if the author had put in some humor. When I saw the add for the ""Replica"" series, I read the summary and thought ""Hey, this sounds great!"" Well they were but I found myself noticing that I was not laughing at all when I read them. I can see why they are put on the shelf labled ""Young adult thriller"". They may not be funny, but they sure are suspenseful, and to me ""funny"" and ""suspenseful"" balance on the scale of a good book. I would highly recomend reading this book."
2,A little flimsy and arrived bent.,"The item arrived with the head badly bent. I was able to straighten it out--not perfect, but sufficient. The fact that it was so easily bent during shipment and so easily straightened by me indicates that the metal used for this product's spiral blade and head-ring is too flimsy and weak. A mixer this size should be more robust in construction. An additional aggravation is that the shipping and handling cost more than the tool--way too high."
4,Installation a bit of a pain,"This is my 2nd attempt working with this.ProsDoes seem to helpNo adhesivescan be reusedeasy to cut.ConsWrinkles easily if not handled carefullygenerally the larger an area is a the harder it is trying to get the bubbles out.Hintsroll the film in reverse to help it straighten out but carefullyyou can put little permanent wrinkles in there, the film actually appears to be 2 layers.This film works pretty well for smaller areas. but try and keep the cutting to a minimum. In my opinion you do not have to to cover window exactly depends how picky you are. One end of the film actually has a small lip 3/16"" which only has 1 layer don't forget to cut that off if you are using that end.Use plenty of water both sides helps with squeezing out bubbles.Make sure the area you are applying to is absolutely spotless even the smallest speck will cause a bubble( distorts vision like a drop of water)."
1,This window film easily comes off. It is worthless.,"I used this film on my garage windows, and it easily falls off. I would not recommend this film to anyone."
2,"Complete pain to install, UV protection questionable","It's impossible to install without any bubbles. While it does clearly filter the light minimally, the temperature difference is non existent."
5,Excellent culimination to an exciting series!,"This is one of my kids' all time favorite series. Con and Hannah are great kids in a real world, and their friendship and adventures make for excellent story-telling. This is my favorite of the three because of the poignant ending. My only disappointment is that Mary Reeves Bell has not written more books. This is top-notch high-quality YA fiction with a Christian worldview, and I wish she'd write more!"
3,Interesting and inviting,"I heard them on a german TV last day. I thought that I had to know more about this group. This song is only a piece of the hole cake. I really enjoyed this song, the rithm reminds me Weezer, but sweeter and more melancholic, and melodic; between pop- techno and electric guitars, with and invinting voice (Daniel Belqvist). I think I've got to listen the hole album to get a really opinion from it (they have 2 albums! and are very apreciated in Germany). Anyway, it's interesting. Another song from Eskobar that you may listen to, is ""Someone New"", one duet with Heather Nova, it's really wonderful!!"
4,Swaying Urban Sambas,"Moacyr Luz is composer, guitarist, and singer of samba, and this album showcases his talents. A traditional samba sound with fine supporting musicians (cavaquinho; surdo, pandeiro, and other percussion; trombone, flute, and clarinet; and vocals), the tunes are diverse, romantic and bright. Luz's co-composers include, depending on track, Wilson Moreira, Nei Lopes, Martinho da Vila, Palbo César Pinheiro, Wilson Das Neves, and especially, with five songs, Aldir Blanc. Among his many albums, this one concentrates on core popular acoustic and sensual samba. This is feel-good gentle music, very similar to but tamer than the exuberant music of Jorge Arago. The spirit of Brazil is evoked and the listener will soon sway with the rhythm. This strong, sweet album will delight the dancer and fan of Brazilian music."
2,Didn't achieve results,"The deflector shipped quickly and installed easily. However, it did not achieve the desired results. I expected less wind noise but after installation there was no change. Possible benefit is the roof could be left open a couple of inches when it is raining without getting wet."
5,When It Happens to You,"This book offers lots of helpful information for recently diagnosed cancer patients, family and friends. As a friend of a breast cancer patient, this book helped me understand what she was going through by reading the journal writing of both authors who are breast cancer survivors. Besides the medical information there were many checklists, i.e. shopping lists, what friends can do to help, ways to relax, etc. that were invaluable."
5,spiked choker,is a great accessory to my cat costume i got from 7th avenue. got it for a great price and got it 2 days after i ordered it.
3,Hits and Misses in History Writing,"If history writing is facts, dates, figures, this book is a winner. It contains a sufficient number of insights to make it a useful history. But it is more pedestrian in analysis, surprisingly self-referential in its style (and perhaps the style of thinking,)and turgid in organization, jumping backwards and forwards in time and topic. Its writing style is tedious, plodding, unimaginative, clumsy, almost as if Lieven were writing in a language other than his own. That begins on page vii of the Preface when the author says about himself, ""the historian found little difficulty orientating (sic) himself."" Where was his editor? Where were John Murray or Yale University Press? Where was his English teacher? I'd be glad to compare editing notes in gruesome detail."
1,Nothing but problems with this machine.,"The parts that come with the machine don't seem to be fitted properly. I have had to take it in twice already to be repaired, and I have been looking for a replacement bulb for months now & can't find one anywhere. It's very important when buying a machine to check the availability of parts. I've now learned my lesson. Wish I had never bought this machine :(."
1,"This is not a good buy, and here is why.","My father purchased my first Euro pro from HSN and it jammed during the first use. I was sewing 3 layers of cotton folded, sewing a straight line- very uncomplicated. I tried everything to get the machine working but ended up sending it back. I decided it must be bad luck and rather than initiating a refund, I replaced it with the present machine which too has jammed and will no longer work. This time I was sewing something even less complicated. I am very dissappointed. I have called Euro Pro over and over and cannot get through. I have emailed them twice and have heard nothing. it is two weeks passed my 30 day warranty and fear I will be stuck with this very expensiive mistake."
4,Ranks up there with Toot Toot!,"My newly three year old still asks for the Wiggles for in the car listening. We have several, but I picked up this one for variety. I like that they are introducing concepts that kids should be learning - There's a song for going to the dentist and going to the doctor's. There's also one that talks about a clock - time awareness. There's also several occupational type songs - fireman, bricklayer, fruit vendor, botanist, etc. Each song has an intro, so you just double the number to get to the CD track you want. You also get to walk on the moon and fly through the sky. A little more mature than the basic Romp Bomp a Chomp. So if you are looking for more Wags,Captain Feathersword, Dorothy or Hot Potato, you may want to wait. If your kid is ready for some new material - Go for it!"
2,Good Story CRAPPY EDITING AND PROOFING,For $15 I expect Harper Collins could at least proof the text!!! I found over 60 typos in the first 150 pages. This makes reading this book difficult when they are talking about the different U-boats and I see something like V-(23 or U-)!3 never mind the other misspellings.I will NEVER buy another Harper Collins published e-book.Now to the story. As others said it is good. A little slow at first but it drew me in and pulled me down to the depths with the crew. To me that's a good story. Go to the library and check it out rather than giving HC and $$. Wonder if the author is aware of the butchery of his text by his publisher?
2,"Mostly about Hardegan's U-123, kind of clunky","This book makes a promising start by delving deep into the early career of Hardegan, Capitan of the famous U-123 that had two exciting tours off the US east coast in WWII. But then the author bogs down in lots of he said/she said about who was responsible for the woeful lack of preparation by the part of US Navy that was supposed to be defending the east coast. So the book clunks back and forth between U-123 and the US Naval Command. How about a book about one or the other? He probably should have just stuck to the story of the U-123."
4,Excellent and realistic.,"I have read parts of this book, and that which I have read has been really fun. There are handy, practical suggestions for making life at home interesting for both you and your children. It is definitely written from a Christian perspective, however one that many denominations would be more or less compatible with. If you are curious/positive about Christianity but don't consider yourself a formal believer, it will also probably work OK for you."
3,Ok book.,"This book has some good ideas, but it is wordy in spots and doesn't lay out the ideas quite as nicely as the Toddler Busy book that I purchased. Ok book, but not my favorite one."
2,All You Need is Duct Tape,"This book is filled with more stories, advertisements, quotes, and pictures. Who knew Duct Tape was so versatile? This book is a great gift for all those guys who use duct tape for everything."
4,"buy this cd- great music, fun, bluesy and well done","I bought this cd without knowing Mr. Gaines and was very pleasantly surprised. It's very nice soul/blues done with superb musicianship and fine vocals and a sense of humor- not boring or ""by the numbers"" like so much modern blues. You can't not like it!!"
5,Good solid ideas,"Amanda Welshe's book provides a good discussion of the challenges we face in today's high-tech, information-hungry world. Her book provides food for thought about the way we operate in the marketplace, as well as some very good concrete advice for how to minize your risk of identity theft. She provides advice on how to obtain a credit report, recognize the sources of information gathering, how to deal with surveillance, and how to look out for your children when they are online. The most useful section for me was how to deal with driectmarketers, since my mailboxes, both paper and electronic, are continally stuffed with offers that hold no interest for me. Welsh sheds light on the kinds of infomration the voernment collects about us, why and how it is used. This is a great book, and should be on every adult's bookshelf."
5,Brilliance,A Joe Chindamo comes along once or twice in several scores of years.Peterson was great as was Garner and of course there's Peter Nero. But Joe has innovations and technique beyond anything that can be expected. His bass notes 'runs' are as good as his fantastic 'right hand.' This disc was worth the price and then some.
2,"Not x rated, just a mature audience type film.",This is just a camcorder quality look at New Orleans mardi gras. I always thought I would like to go there and participate but after watching this tape I'm having second thoughts. About 90% of the show is just overweight intoxicated and inarticulate men trying to get the women who occasionally wander by to expose their breasts. Most of the women are far too old to be making a spectacle of themselves. And far too flabby. But the men are so intoxicated they don't seem to mind. There's no narration nor any point to this video.
4,Wow!,"A great ski flick. If you're into back-country shots, this is the video for you (though it also has some great terrain park shots as well). If you want a movie mostly of terrain park shots, don't get this, as this is mostly back country heli-skiing and powder shots.Incredible HD camera-work, high-mountain descents, powder shots, and pillow jumping. A lot of fun."
2,Requires studying too much irrelevant information,"I found this book disappointing. I like books that are succint and to the point, like Ilona Bray's book [[ASIN:1413305245 Becoming a U.S. Citizen: A Guide to the Law, Exam & Interview]-- better yet, get the 4th edition]. Kaplan takes you deep into US history and civics, which isn't bad, of course, but irrelevant in the preparation for the interview. It also leads to fears that you will be asked questions outside those posted on the uscis.gov website. Perhaps this book is of greater value to those who need to expand their English or learn even the fundamentals about US history, but if not, don't bother."
2,Maybe I got a lemon?,"When it worked it did well. I was very happy with how light the machine is, and small, easy to handle, compared with all my previous ones. Also the bunch of special feet were very nice too.Unfortunately I don't know if mine was a lemon, but every so often the thread would either get stuck or pushing too much thread and making loops without me making any changes in the settings. What seemed to make things worse was pressing the reverse function.Didn't try the advanced features. Just returned it."
2,Item received was not item ordered/advertised,"I ordered the Euro-Pro 7500XH Craft N' Sew and received a machine that ""looked"" like it had all of the features of the advertised item, but was labeled ""Deluxe Denim Machine"" rather than Craft N' Sew. After several e-mails to Amazon returns and several automated responses from Amazon, I decided to return the unit, fearing it was a refurbished, knock-off or imperfect unit that may not qualify for the 25 year warranty. The box stated it was a 7500XH, but the unit enclosed begged to differ - model and unit numbers on the machine did not match up to the advertised model numbers. Make sure you check your machine carefully upon delivery to ensure it is the item you actually ordered. I returned the unit and decided to order a Singer, I have a history with this brand and know it will perform."
5,Beautiful voice,My mother listened to Claudine Longet when I was a child and so I have very fond memories of this music. I love her voice...soft and feminine. I very much enjoy this CD and I highly recommend it to any Longet fan.
3,good harmony,"The somewhat talented and entertaining team of mother and daughter rate a 3 star by me, I had hoped for better with this cd, but there is just too much yodeling on these cd's, even though there are 50 songs.If you are into yodeling you may really enjoy these but I'm not that much into that."
2,Major Pain to Clean!,"I don't just find this thing annoying to clean, it's a major pain. After only a couple of uses, it will mildew so you definitely HAVE to hang it up after each and every use. I can throw it in the washer (on hot) with okay results, but since it's see-through, I spend a lot of time cleaning it so I can't see the mildew which drives me nuts (we have a white tub so it really shows up). Also, at least in our tub, it doesn't stick that well. It definitely bunches up and since I remove it after each use, I am constantly trying to get it to stick, to no avail...In my opinion, this is a major drawback, hence the 2 stars."
5,great bath mat,terrific bath mat for use in an old style tub as it nearly fits the space perfectly given it is oversized. i use this for my 16 month old daughter and it has been really good at keeping her from slipping although i still dont let her stand up
3,"If you're using it for kids, buy the other white kind.","This mat works just fine, but the opaque, white mats that suction cup have some texture/friction in the material itself so it keeps my kid from slipping around better than this mat did."
2,Floating bath mat,"I chose this product because it was clear (aesthetics), had moderate reviews and looked like it would provide some cushion and slip protection for my baby.What I got was a large floating piece of plastic. The bath mat won't stick to the bottom of the tub and keeps floating up. My daughter kept trying to lift it up over her head and crawl underneath. Needless to say, it's no longer in our tub."
4,Almost perfect watch,"I've had this watch for nearly a year now, and it's still the one with more wrist time. Since june 2007, it is only about 50 seconds ahead of time compared to the GPS clock at work, so it is really accurate.Perpetual calendar and eco-drive are the reasons I bought this watch and I'm relly pleased with it.The minor cons I have are:- The leather band is not that great, the leather is good quality, but unless you put a butterfly clasp (18mm), you'll ruin it.- The Lumibrite does not last enough for my taste.- The alarm is not loud enough.On a side note, if like me, you like better this one because of the black ION bezel than the version with the S/S band, you can buy the S/S band, it's a perfect fit (Citizen Part #59-S02275). It's on my wrist now, and I would give it 5 stars with the new S/S band. Very satisfied."
1,This product is a FRAUD!!!!!,"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T GET HOODWINKED BY THIS DVD!!!!!!!! The product's manufacturer, ""MAKE IT OR BREAK IT"", committed fraud. The DVD includes 14 Janet Jackson videos, when there is NO MENTION of JANET JACKSON ANYWHERE in the title or packaging of the DVD. Because of this fraudulent advertising, I only discovered this problem when I played the DVD. If I wanted a Janet Jackson product, I would have bought a Janet Jackson product. They should have just been upfront and AT LEAST warned that there would be another artist included on the DVD with Mary J. (who only gets 12 videos on the DVD by the way). I would have been fine with that. Instead, when you play the DVD (after you have spent your money and bought the thing), they put on a disclamer saying they do not guarantee product satsifaction and if you are dissatisfied, go to their website to complain where they can probably sell other stuff to you. Scam."
5,"Small, fast, and secure",The Crucial Gizmo! is a good looking small form factor. Smaller than a pack of Juicy Fruit! It does a great job of quickly transferring data to and from my computer. It has security software that lets you partition your drive into private and public sections and will only let you access the private partition with a password. Pretty cool! I carry it on my key chain where ever I go. It comes with a lanyard and key ring. I cut the neck part off of the lanyard and used the bottom part to put on my key chain. It allows you to easily detach it from your key chain.
3,philosophical,"This book is a very cerebral work consisting of lectures. The fictional elements, such as plot, are minimal. It's worth reading, especially if you care about animals."
2,Plants?,"Ladies and Gentleman- What about plants? They participate in respiration, reproduction, growth, death, and energy production and consumption. How can one step on an ant and also play baseball? The answer--one can't, both kill living organisms. We kill magnificent trees for windows, so we can separate ourselves from the outdoors with a clear slate of glass. We kill winter wheat for our own selfish desires. We manage to chop off the faces of sunflowers for salty indulgences. Where will it end? We should be ashamed of ourselves. Perception=Ability to Engage=Possibility=Creativity=Living. AMEN! Free both the circus elephant and the blade of grass! FREEDOM!"
5,Super COOL ! For all ages !,"Ok.. So who cares about cards? they go in the trash anyway... WRONG... These cards were such a big hit last year I look forward to sending them out again this year. While you won't be able to write a novel, you can elevate having to write the ususal mumbo-jumbo because there's not much space. (I'm seeing the glass 1/2 full) The cards are special and interesting works of art. If you are tired of the same old boring cards, give these a try. I am now a loyal fan."
3,"less than expected, but maybe I'm just spoiled :-)","I somehow felt that the product was a little less than I expected: maybe it's because few cards were actuallly dirty, or because I found the design to be more simple than I grow to expect from mr Sabuda.But maybe I am just spoiled :-)"
5,Unique Christmas Cards,"I received the Christmas Alphabet Cards today. They surpassed my expectations! I know my family and friends will be pleasantly surprised when they open their cards. In the past, I have purchased one of Robert Sabuda's pop-up books. He is such an unique artist! The beautiful snowflake design tin is a plus. You can fill it with Christmas ""goodies"" and give it to someone special."
5,Each Card Is A Gift!,"It is so much fun to send Robert Sabuda cards! People love them. I liked this series so much that I bought one set to keep for my family.Each card is different, and unique. I love imagining how happy my friends will be when they open their cards.You can't help but smile filling out each card. You will have as much fun sending these cards as your friends will have receiving them!Happy Holidays!"
2,GOOD TABLE IF NOT FOLDED,"I BOUGHT TABLE FROM COSTCO AND REALLY LIKE IT AS IT IS VERY STABLE. PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO FOLD TO MOVE IT, THE BRACKETS BEND AND THE SCREWS FELL OUT. IT HAS HAPPENED BOTH TIMES I FOLDED IT, THE FIRST TIME I FIXED IT AND NOW I WANT TO RETURN IT TO COSTCO. ALSO THE PIN MECHANISM IS NOT WORKING TO LOCK THE TABLE IN RAISED POSITION."
5,Helped a lot.,You really don't need an expensive accountant or attorney to get tax forgiveness...the rules are the rules know them and your on your way!
4,"generally good, but uncomfortable strap....","It's good, generally.protective, fit into my 12"" laptop, good design...but its strap isn't that comfortable.However, I recommend it because nothing is perfect."
3,"Another Beautiful Remaster, Mixed Batch Of Material.","Another great remaster by RPM.The CD launches with Come Into My Music Box. This is a great psych tune with a brilliant spring reverb vocal by Paul Jones. It sounds like a fab 60s Bowie song. Committee, Homburg and I'm Here To Nudge Your Mind are beautifully produced cabaret psych.The bonus tracks feature some surprise Manfred-esque mono rockers and odd cabaret songs.Most of the material is marginal. The covers of Wheels On Fire (Trinity), Baby, Now That I've Found You (The Foundations) and It's Getting Better (Mama Cass) are especially weak.I love the sound and production. If you've got an odd 10 bucks and you're looking for some big production 60s pop, this is an interesting dip into those waters."
3,"A good book, but not for beginners.","if you want an introduction to complex analysis, I advise you to pass on this book, and read Churchill and Brown's introductory book. Having said this, part I of Lang's book will seem mostly review if you follow my advice. Part II, on Geometric Function Theory, is more advance material that is presented reasonably well."
1,Very Uncomfortable,"This mask is so snug and uncomfortable and is impossible to wear with eye glasses. I have a small head, so I can't imagine anyone with a normal size head using this. And if you wear eye glasses, the top of the mask presses into your eye glasses."
5,Awesome story,"This was such an awesome book! I got it because it was on Sonlight's 3rd Grade reading list, and am SO glad I did.My 8 & 4 year old daughters were absolutely enthralled at this story of a young girl, lost in the woods of New England, whileher family held on tightly to their faith in God, to bring her home.The ending was so powerful, we read the whole book in about an hour-I cried through most of the last chapter while I read.Cannot say enough good things about this story. Definitely one we will keep, and we just ordered a book that goes along with it ""The bear who heard crying""Can't wait to get it!"
3,Erm.....good but not great,"On it's own, this was a good movie. Unfortunately, though, it was the third part to an excellant series. The quality wasn't as high as the previous American Tail movies. The animation was, well, bad. Fortunately the few songs were good (especially ""Anywhere in our Dreams""). The story was also OK. It deals a little with racism (the Americans don't like the other mice because they are Natives) and how the Europeans took over the Natives' land. This is perhaps something that children should watch. They'd enjoy it for sure. Like I said. It's good on it's own, but only on it's own. Worth the money anyways...."
2,This movie,Okay. Alright I thought it was lame. The political correctness . I thought kids movies were a safe haven from that. The acting [was no good]. The animation oh lord. The animation it was done by the crew that created animanics. I hate warner bros animation. The good points were Cholina and Fievel. They were true to themselves. Fievel he's more annoying in this movie. He was cute and spirited in the first movie. I'll give an account of the films' good points. The movie isn't some lame recap of the first. Two stars for a good effort. minus three stars for political correctness.
2,An unoriginal American Tail!,Plain & Simple- An American Tail & Fieval Goes West (1 & 2)...are two of the greatest cartoon movies to date...Why? Because of Director Don Bluth. i.e. (The Land Before Time.The Original 1st Bluth movie surpasses all of the others.)Stick with the originals - Only try'n to Help!
3,My View On American Tail of Manthattan Island,Fun and exciting adventure of Feviel and the Gang ! Fun for any age or fans of the oringinal American Tail from 1986 !Short but excellent adventure of American Tail and worth checking out for the kids and anybody else !
3,Garmin Foretrex 101 - Afghanistan,Great product. it was able to pick up wherever i was in theater but the only drawback for me was the fragile watch pins holding it onto the watchband style strap. it broke off on the first day out. i had to have a local national sewing shop make a special holster for it out of canvas then i had to restrap it to the watchband to be functional. it works perfectly out on patrol. everything locationwise was right on. great piece of kit but poor support element.
5,Pretty Good,"This movie was great. Really good acting. I'm a fan of indie movies also, but even for an indie film it was really good. Not an original story, but told well. The ending was shocking! Gets my stamp of approval."
3,City is Mine,"I checked this flick out because it was filmed near my hometown and as a former film student myself I like to check out the Indie circuit and film making. City is Mine had it's strong points and it's not so strong points. The lack of a Hollywood budget is apparent but I thought the director did well with a ""less is more"" approach for the on screen violence.l Characters were entertaining. I especially liked Becky T Bordo and Keven Interdonato in this film. Both of them have star potential. Some of the editing and pacing could have been. It was refreshing to see an urban drama that didn't star hip-hops flavor of the month. Worth a watch and if you are into this genre you might want to toss it into the collection. IMO."
1,I NEVER ARRIVE Flexfit Team Logo Cap,I DID MY I DEMAND The DAY THAT I ARRIVE MY PACKAGE And The GORRE THIS IN THIS PACKAGE of day 31 of August of 2006
4,Helpful tips,"This has helpful information in a nice small, concise form. Would be a great gift to a recent college graduate. However, I didn't care for the many references to the show ""Sex and the City"". I don't find the characters on that show to be good examples of elegance."
2,"Looks pretty, but empty of content","I bought all 3 books in the Pink Books series and I am disappointed with each and every one of them, they're each small, cute and portable (think about keeping it in your mini purse to read while waiting in line), but the content is more than just lacking, it's like reading the headlines of the news without actually reading the story. Wouldn't buy again. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the design and portable size."
5,Great book...,This is a great book for helping a young woman become more classy and elegant. Book was received in good condition and in a timely manner.
1,Burn your money. Don't buy this book,A complete waste of time and energy ... Whoever published this should be ashamed... And I am the fool who bought it
3,Not bad....not great,"This book was okay; not too bad and not too good. There were some cute things in here that I really liked. You might enjoy this book. It's small, cute, and very nice to read. Overall, I liked it and glad I purchased it."
1,Don't waste your time,"Another reviewer said you have to view this film properly. How can you properly view this film? There's no point or plot. I suppose this movie had a deep meaning? I can't even rate this as being the worst film I've ever seen because it doesn't even have the so bad it's good quality, just bad. I can't believe this is going to be a trilogy? It would have to have some kind of point first. Now please excuse me while I go throw up onto a severed hand. Duuuuuhhhhhh"
4,"Great Tape, not for Beginners",We really enjoyed this tape but it is NOT for beginners. It moves quickly and assumes you already know the positions. A great tape for intermediate use that focuses on stretching commonly used sport muscles.
3,Won't condition a serious athlete,"I have a number of other yoga tapes that I use and thought that this would be a good one since I am a runner and triathlete. I am not even a very competitive athlete, and I still found this tape to be not very challenging. I was expecting a tape geared at athletes to be more challenging than standard yoga tapes, and it was not. It is far easier than the other tapes I have. If you are a beginner, this would be a good tape because it does not use more advanced poses, however there are times that it seems Rodney Yee assumes you should know the position names already, so be alert for that."
3,Good for athletes new to yoga,"This is a good entry level video for the athlete who is feeling too tight and out of sync. The multiple variations are an excellant addition. Unquestionably, they will aid in balancing flexibility with strength which will aid in athletic performance. Rodney Yee is an excellent instructor. Proper attention is placed on the breath as is essential for true yoga. In as far as the conditioning workout that it promises, it falls short. One is better off with Brian Quest or similar videos.None the less this video has it's place and is a good starting place."
4,Nice stretching.,"I like this tape for opening up hips and stretching. You can feel the pain in days after of good run. I only gave the tape 4 stars because it's not really satisfying enough for a complete hour yoga workout. While for daily 20-min stretching, I find that the third tape in Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Beginners: Flexibility has much of the same stretching goodness in a smaller package, so I can also have time for other workouts."
5,A workout for everybody,"I practice yoga 4+ times a week with classes or videos. Rodney Yee leads a very well explained and demonstrated hour of yoga. I have fibromyalgia, chronic bilateral hip bursitis, and vertigo, yet was able to do and enjoy this tape (naturally, my poses don't reach the level of Yee's). An excellent all over workout. pt"
4,Untitled,"Product is great, the price is reasonable, and the delivery is made in time. Nothing to complain."
3,"interesting book, for young adults","This book is a biographical account of famous Cleopatra VII, the last Macedonian ruler of Egypt. It provides descriptive details about her family, her lovers and her importance in Egyptian history. Illustrated with 12 black and white pictures and 3 maps, it is a highly readable work, accessible to the general public, yet most valuable for young adults."
1,Major Disapointment !!,"I was so upset when I received this book !! I was looking for a comprehensive biography of Cleapatra and all I got here was a few pages of dribble. It didn't touch at all on what I was looking for which was her children and her daily life. It was scetchy and iratic. Not much to read in fact the words are in a large font and its all double spaced. A major waste of book. If you are looking to research this mysterious lady, do not look here."
2,Important stuff but hard slogging,"This is an encyclopedia, and reading such things is not what most people, even when deeply interested in the subject are likely to do. It does provide a fair reference for specific topics, but this is not a subject one can really pick and choose.VAR is the ususal starting point, and its famous authors (one of whom I hired for his skill in these matters) cover most of the bases in an interesting way."
3,"Great Book, but Poor quality...","Some of the pages of this book were stuck together at the top, and had to be separated with a knife...However, the book is excellent in content with a nice size text for reading.... I will keep it and try to get the pages cut apart so the book will open.....I want to read it soon..!"
1,NOT SO STICKY,For a self-seal solution don't buy this product. Had 2 reach the destination empty because the seal did not hold. I am talking about an item inside that was less than an ounce. It just did not bond when pressed together. Now I have to tape each envelope to make sure my item is still inside when it arrives.
1,Dogswell Duck Strip poisoned and killed 1 Std. Poodle and sickened 4 others. They are made in CHINA. Beware and be very careful.,"Always trying to give holistic, natural healthy treats to our dogs, but this product has the words ""Made in China"" in tiny letters. Our dog became ill. Vet suspected poisoning, tested for and found that the liver was failing. At autopsy, poisoning was verified. 4 other dogs were also sickened by this product. Be very careful. Trust treats made in China and you are taking a huge risk that no one wants to take with their beloved pet."
5,Siberian Huskies Favorite Treat!,"Have 3 rescued Siberians and this is their favorite treat. They want to know if they could buy duck flavor in bulk to save money, or if Dogswell could make a treat in possum flavor? (Just kidding.)"
2,"Um, It's Been Recorded Better Elsewhere","This 20 song collection of Bee Gees hits and perennial favorites is an odd mix. Arranged in a hodge-podge, non-sequential order, the songs run from 1967 to 1976. Quite a variety in range, but better available on any of their ""Best Of"" CD's. The remastering is better elsewhere as well."
1,Historical Inaccuracies,"Although it is a great traveller's guide, this book is full of historical inaccuracies. It approaches the history of the region with a cunning, not so obvious effort to avoid the Hellenic origins of the ancient inhabitants of Ionia, Anatolia, Kappadokia, Pontos and Eastern Thrace. Leaving out the Hellenic history of these areas, renders all relevant historical references of this book invalid. Furthermore, judging by the extent of the author's education, this seems to be deliberate. One should stick to the travelling information only. If you're interested in history, buy another book."
4,Turkish Odyssey,"This is a good source for anyone planning to travel to Turkey or who just wants to know more about the country and its culture. We're planning a trip to Turkey later this year, and this book nicely supplements another travel book I had already purchased, especially with regard to history and culture."
5,Loved it!,"I loved this book! Remembrance gives us a glimpse into the everyday lives of families just a few generations ago. As I read, I grew to care about the characters and what happened to them, hating to let them go at the end. I was particularly drawn to the the women in the novel--the hardships they endured and the strength they displayed is surely deserving of our admiration."
5,A Loving Window Into The Past,A compelling presentation of a family autobiography in novel form which has universal messages to share with its readers. I was moved by the characters and enjoyed being transported back in time through the detailed descriptions of life in Georgia and Florida as my great grandparents and grandparents would have known it. I'd recommend it for sure. How this family sticks together through a number of tough milestones is inspiring.
1,so cute but unwearable in my case,This shoe is just as cute as it looks. I ordered it in black with the red aka diablo zipper. It's very cute and flattering. I've seen other women wearing them and they look great. Does anyone else have a problem with the shoe needing to be gripped with your feet?
3,Ok for the money,"I bought the NEW not refurb. of this TV and was thrilled with it for about a year. Ive had it for about a year and a half and it has started ghosting alot. It is only in extreme color differences (ie. black and white) and dosen't affect general use, but it can get anoying. I paid $260 for mine and feel I got a little cheated, but all in all, not a bad TV."
1,"Flat in the front, huge back","Maybe I did not read it well but this ""flat screen"" has a huge backing, Have to keep it, I cannot return it."
3,"Okay, but not up to specs","We recently bout a bunch of these for use at our farm, but while they work better than the $20 radios we've been using they are not capable of getting all the way across the 40 acre plot when any obstruction is in the way. They'll have to go back, sorry to say. We need something that deals with steel sided barns better."
1,Who knows how to solve the C:13:01 error ?,"I bought the Sony 128 MB Memory Stick (MSH-128) a few months ago, but I only used it once. When I was in my 20th picture, an error appeared in the screen of my Sony P100 camera:Error C:13:01, Memory Stick failedFirst, I went to Sony Service Center, but they didn't know what was happening. Then, I went to different Sony Stores, but the only answer they gave me was that my Memory Stick is failed, that it's impossible to fix or format it and, the worst, there is no way to save the pictures !!!!Finally, I tried to solved it by myself, and I ""google"" the C:13:01 error. If you do it, you will find hundreds of people with the same problem, looking for a solution.That's why I don't recommend this product. If all of us have the same problem, you can be the next."
2,"""Memory Stick Error""","My newly purchased item seems to be malfunctioning. After only taking a dozen pictures, my sony camera is showing a ""memory stick error"" message. Don't know how to progress."
3,Sony Media = Expensive,Sony has a monopoly when it comes to media to be used with their cameras because they do not accept other card formats. It usually costs at least 25% more per megabyte than other more universal formats - like SD cards.
3,I ordered two of the same but...,"I had no idea when I order this and the same item, Amazon would split my order to two different companies and charge me two different prices + shipping!"
1,INADEQUATE CAPACITY,"I HAVE A SONY DCS F707 CAMERA THAT RECEIVES ONLY THE 128 MB MEMORY STICK AND IM CHANGING IT TO A USED DSC F717 CAMERA THAT RECEIVES 2GB MEMORY STICK, 'ALMOST' FOR THE SAME PRICE OF THE 128 MB MEMORY STICK"
1,NEVER RECEIVED,Do not trust this distributor. The product was ordered in August and has yet to be delivered.
1,Air Conditioning and Refrigeration,"This book smacks of being done by researchers, not experts in the field. It is very outdated. It does not feature modern refrigerants, tools, or service techniques. While some of the information will always be applicable to the field, the information is researched, borrowed...not from the authors' experience in the field. My father was teaching me in the late 1960's. Had he given me this book I would have thought it useful but a bit old fashioned. You can tell the authors do not practice in the field or the shop or they would have realized their information was from the refrigeration dinasaur age!"
2,Not good for me,I would not recommend this product. It works great at first but as time goes on your face gets a orange tint to it.
1,Horrid Smell!!,"I got this and used it today and had to take a shower... it smells terrible! It says Green tea smell but it is SO strong that it is horrible! It was like a watery substance,too, and I saw no benefits. No thanks to this!"
3,Good Reference Book,"I thought the book was well laid out and readable -- given the atrocious documentation that came with PFC 5, it is a good companion.Oh the minus side, it is written for PFC 5 (all code examples, etc.) PFC 6 is an add-on chapter and is not integrated.The other difficulty I found was that it was not critical of the PFC -- pointing out its better services and ones that are frankly weak.Hopefully the authors will produce a book for PFC 6.5!"
3,Don't expect too much,"This is the book that Powersoft should have provided with the libraries. And nothing more. It is absurd that a library like PFC should be sold with just a list of function and objects. The authors of this book are very good at organizing the original list and presenting it in a more friendly way. I still would like to know why the release of the book was held back 6 months. Was it because of the chapter on PFC 6.0 that never made it into print but is included in the CD?On the bright side, the authors are household names for the PB/PFC community and it is like having a friend's book on the shelve."
3,Good PFC 5.0 reference only.,"I rate this book only average as it suffers from the all too common computer book problem of not being up to date with the current version of the technology subject matter. At least there is a chapter 21 on the CD that reviews PFC 6.0 material. But unfortunately, the supplied sample application only demonstrates PFC 5.0 code. Finally, I found much of the material in the book merely a rehash of other material spread throughout PB documentation."
2,Very Specialized,"I am a technical person who thought the word ""Foundation"" in the title would be a good starting point. Howver, ""Foundation Class Librry"" is a very specific thing for programmers who already know the software. Makes a good doorstop."
3,just ok !,"The book describes a few things about PFC. Interestingly half the time, to know about any detailed services of a particular type it says ""More information about 'xyz' can be found in Powerbuilder Online Books and PFC online help.""Then why do you need to buy this book ?????"
5,This book saved my life!,"I am surprised at some of the past reviewers of this book. They sound like armchair secret agents that want a book like this to tell them all the secrets of 9/11, Roswell and the Kennedy assassination, all for under a dollar!The truth is, however, that this book is a how-to manual for people who need to lay low for a while, because of financial problems, stalkers, vengeful ex-spouses, or what have you.Do the techniques it describes work? YES. Using them I was able to disappear for several months during a time when a vengeful and psychotic ex-boyfriend wanted very much to put a bullet in me. He is now sitting in prison, and I am safe for at least 20 years. But if I hadn't found this book then I would likely be dead at this point.I strongly recommend this book for anyone who needs to get away from things for a while - without anyone being able to track them down."
2,"Quick-reading, underwhelming book/advertisement.","If you read this book and find yourself saying, ""wow, I never would have thought of that!"" you may have more important issues to deal with than ones your looking to run away from. The suggestions offered are very basic and common-sense which was a little disappointing; more annoying is that the author continually points you to other books, most of which are published by... you guessed it, the same publisher that put this one out. It comes across as a thinly veiled advertisement more than a manual."
3,few good ideas,"this book is more like a large pamphlet. The book is mainly a lot of ideas that are somewhat common sense (at least to me). In order to make most of this book work for you, you might want to also get a book on how to extremely lower your standards. The author suggests most of his ideas to become homeless and hitchhike as opposed to actually setting up a new identity although there are a few ideas about that. All in all for the length of the read i didnt expect to much, but got a few ideas."
1,Awful,"First, before you waste your money, head to a Barnes N Nobles and check the book out. If you have an hour to kill, you'll finish the book, that's how short it is.Second, if you know anything about public transportation, motels, shelters, and relatives that would gladly let you crash with them, then you know 90% of this book. If you know how to open a P.O. Box or a private mail box at a facility like the U.P.S. store, then you know the remaining 10% of this book.If this book cost $1, then perhaps it would be worth it. Could always use a fire-starter."
2,It's all common sense,"I am really disappointed in this book. There is nothing written that cannot be figured out by an average adult. The suggestions given do not go into enough detail to be useful. Instead, try a book like Bulletproof Privacy, by Boston T. Party, if you really want to cover your tracks."
3,A Very Small Book with a Few Good Tidbits and Stories,"I felt cheated and reading this book. It seems the author loves to send you to other books to get to the meat of how to disappear without going into a lot of detail. To be fair, his stories are cute, but this book lacks meat and delivers whip cream in its place. Look elsewhere."
1,Read if you are a fugitive,"Yeah, you can disappear if you lose everything and hitchhike around and live in cardboard boxes and the occasional flophouse. No good ideas in this book if you want to maintain some semblance of a lifestyle."
3,Euro-pro 534DX -- expensive parts,"Overall I have been happy with the performance of this machine. However, just recently my daughter broke the plate under the foot. There's a small, very thin piece of metal on the plate on which the thread rides. She tried to sew some heavy material, blue jean fabric, and the combination of the material and (probably) her pulling, bent the metal piece. I called for a replacement part -- the part was $49.95 plus $10.00 shipping!! I'm going to keep watching ebay for a used machine to buy to use for replacement parts."
2,This is my 1st Serger----Oh My,It has taken me 1 week to see the in & outs of serging. Now to replace the needles.I have been working on this all morning. If I get one in the other want go. If I take one out the other will go in. These are the ones that came with the serger.Now I have lost 2 i/2 hrs on this. I am wondering if the needles are bad. Not a good thing for a new kid on the block. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day. Lady De
3,Tuner not bad for a beginner,Hard to get it right from my experience. Since purchasing I found programs that you can download to tune a guitar that may work as good or better.
2,Without a clue,"I have now, twice ordered this book described as a ""hard-Back"" book.The first from a recommended vendor, and the second a vendor ""fulfilled"" by Amazon.Both books are paperbacks (Not Hard-Back). The first book was totally dog-eared and quite dirty. The second book is well less than what I would describe as ""Good"" but will meet my needs.Whoever ""screens"" this material and provides the descriptions needs glasses."
1,A Terrible Choice,"For some reason, NatGeo decided to put the key to their map right over the Palermo neighborhood, which is one of the main visitor destinations. You can't see any of the main Palermo roads and intersections, making much of the map useless. It would be like covering up the Manhattan section of a New York City map.It's a shame because otherwise this would be a great map. Whoever designed it must not have asked anyone who lived or visited Buenos Aires what they think of it. Find another option."
4,Great Brush Markers,"I had a very old set of Uchida 1500-12A brush markers that I finally used up & had to replace. I tried different types of brush markers for stamping, & so far, none have met my approval. While the ink's more durable than the other markers I've tried, the newer Uchida 1500-12A markers aren't as ""permanent"" as my original set; hence only 4 stars. If you use the markers to stamp children's hands, they will wash off--some colours quicker than others. However, if you use the stamps on paper, the colours are great & more vibrant than many other brands."
3,Does have interesting perspectives and information,"Well, I must say that I was a bit surprised by the author's tone in the first few chapters. Although the book is about (and is even titled) ""the answer for the dangerously overweight"", the author seemed a bit harsh against the obese and, although showing this option, also is able to chastize many readers.Although I am only half done with it right now, I feel it is worthwhile to read, if only because negative views can be just as important to know as the positive views."
4,INTERESTING HISTORY OF AN IMPORTANT COUNTRY,"These two volumes are a copy of an History written about 170 years ago . So , we have to consider two points - first , there is no influence of the last years , when the parts are completly splitten ; second , the last one and half century is not included . The work is mainly a polical description from early times , and does not give importance to other matters , such as development of art , commercial activity , etc . But , what is done is well done ."
5,"""...serves the dual purpose of educating the general public.","""...serves the dual purpose of educating the general public..and of helping the epilepsy sufferer and family members cope."""
4,A Helpful Book,"While the author has no medical credentials, she simply shares what she has learned through living with epilepsy. One has to remember that all results will not be like those of the author. There is not a lot of information here, but it is a good place to start to investigate alternative therapies."
4,great information,This book really helped with alot of information and practical advice to better understand the condition and options with it.
5,Great history and great read,"Once again Charles Dickens pulls off another great story. I actually haven't read the first part of the book: ""Master Humphreys Clock"" but loved ""A Child's History of England"". Rather like Howard Zinn's ""Peoples History of the United States"", Dickens is brutally honest (if that word could be used when there didn't seem to be any references) about the Kings and Queens of England. A great way to learn history with some memorable tales told along the way."
5,Good scale,"This is a nice scale that is very easy to use. I mainly use it for baking, but it also works for determining serving sizes (pasta) and other uses around the house (postage). The 11 lb. limit is enough that I've never had any problems. It is easy to switch between grams and oz. (unlike some of the other Soehnle scales). The scale can also be hung on the wall for storage.My only gripe is that the scale doesn't have a removeable platform. But I usually put a plate on it, so the scale stays clean."
4,Recommend this scale after several months use,"Being avid home cooks, my husband and I use this scale for practically all meal preparations. It replaced a kitchen scale that was 10 years old that had a lower weight limit of 4 lbs. I like that this scale has an 11 lb limit. This scale is light weight and compact. It fits nicely in a vertical position in a cabinet above my main work service. I can grab it one handed. I have not experience the scale shutting down too soon. My only complaint is that when you press the tare function or the off function, it takes a tad long to respond. Thinking that I haven't pushed it hard enough, I'll press it again thereby reversing the function I had intended. Now I know to wait for it to respond a few more seconds. I recommend this scale."
3,"OK, so it's not the sexiest model out there","Cons: The knob to switch between kilo and imperial measure was poorly designed. It's stiff to move, and there is no real way to grip the knob in order to turn it.Pros: It does what it is supposed to do. The base is large enough to accommodate any container that I would typically use to measure with. I especially like the hanger which allows me to hang it on the wall under the cabinet, keeping it within handy reach.Updated 3/2008 -- I updated this review because I've had this scale for a couple years now, and it has never let me down. I would give it a 4 star if I could change the rating. I use this scale a lot, and it's never given me a whit of trouble, other than the part I've listed under the cons. It isn't the sleekest looking design, but it's accurate and simple to use. Press a button to turn it on, press the button again to zero out for tare weight. Every now and then I check the accuracy, and it hasn't been off yet."
1,"Well, it doesn't hold up well.","Purchased this because of reviews and you can hang it. Right off the bat the thin plastic over the display fell off.Seems to be just lightly glued with something sticky. The grams/ounce knob was always very difficult to move.This knob has stopped working. It is stuck on grams. Gave up with the plastic over display staying on. My guess is the gram/ounce knob could be fixed, but, like most products, no screws. Waste of money and I will not buy this brand again. Can you give a product zero stars?"
4,Easy to read scale,This scale is easy to read and also accurate. It is larger than I had anticipated but is light weight.
2,good for a few years,"we got these a few years back, and i loved the way it looked. however, after a year or two, they started breaking. if you used your fork to cut into somthing, the round meTal part that holds the fork/spoon/knife head, cracked and one by one all our forks broke. we have had it for 4 years and all our forks are broken, the round metal cap at the bottom of the handles have come off, and the round metal part that holds the utensil heads have all rusted and turned brownits good for a short while, but not for daily use. i regret buying these and will now only buy all metal utensils that can't break"
2,Pretty but bend!,"This flatware set looks great, but when you use the fork the top part bends, so you have to push it back straight. I am sure it won't take long for them to break. For the price I guess it is expected, but I have similar ones that don't bend so was somewhat surprised!"
4,Nice book,"Very easy to read, looks a little dated but has good information, helpful for Pomeranian owners. Gives some real life experiences on certain topics such Pomeranians in dog shows, agility training, therapy dogs, etc."
3,okay book,a pretty good book but i didnt get the dvd that was soppose to come with it thats why it got a low rating
1,Poor engineering,"Having severe arthritis and fibro, I though this would be an easy way to my my family's favorite spritz cookies.....The plunger comes off the threaded track about every third cookie, so you have to empty the barrel, re-thread the plunger and start over. Wasn't fast, wasn't easy and definitly did not live up to its promise of ""hundreds of cookies per charge....finally threw it away and purchased a manual cookie press! Made six dozen cookies in less time than it took to do one dozen with the VillaWare press."
1,awful,you have to fiddle around with this thing a ton. I've had it for two years and only used it at christmas. this year the tube split during a batch. I can't find a replacement. don't buy it.
1,worked less than once,"doesn't hold charge, slow, motor conked out with the very first batch of cookies. Piece of junk!"
1,Buy the warranty!,"As others have said, the plastic dough tube is junk and won't last. The manufacturer is completely uninterested in making good on what is clearly a substandard part. It also needs a very soft dough, as I discovered the hard way. I'm going back to a manual press. I wish I could find a corded electric press like the one I used to have. If you're going to get this one, you should probably spend another $10 on the product insurance."
1,PowerLESS Cookie Press,"If I could have rated this zero stars, I would have. This press would not handle the dough of my wife's butter cookies. She ended up rolling them out by hand and using manual cookie cutters. And lest you think her dough is too thick, for 20+ years she used an old Cookie Shooter brand press to make those same cookies. I guess they just don't make them like they used to..."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I am an avid cook and baker. I used this unit twice and it broke after the 2nd useage. I found it to be very slow; the charge didn't last long so I had to keep it plugged in. The dough had to be very very soft in order for the press to produce the cookies. I am very disappointed that such an expensive item would operate so poorly.
3,cookie press,Works for me because I have arthritis in my hands and couldn't use my manual one anymore. However it is a lot slower and more time consuming.
2,VillaWare cookie press-a disappointment,"I purchased this cookie press after my Wearever Super Shooter quit after 22 years. I wanted a cookie press with a plug. I did not want to deal with batteries. This cookie press can be battery operated or it has the option to use the plug. I was highly disappointed with the power in the press. It took me more than 3 hours to do what I did with my old press in one hour. I do use this with a thicher dough, but my old cookie press had no trouble at all with the thickness. I packed the VillaWare Cookie Press up and mailed it back. I bought a used Wearever Super Shooter on E-Bay. I would not recommend this cookie press unless you are working with a very pliable cookie dough."
1,"Do Not BUY!!! Horrible, coil failed after 2 hours of driving.","My car has 150,000 miles, so I did some major tune-up work on it, which included changing out the ignition coils. After doing so I drove for about two hours without incident and then the next time I went to start my car I had a misfire in 2 of my cylinders. After some troubleshooting, determined that one of the coils was bad, changed it out with a Duralast coil and problem fixed. I then swapped out the other coil, so I would not have anymore problems with these Standard Motor Products Coils. Bottom line, horrible product and I will never purchase another product from Standard Motor Products."
2,Terrible,"E.A. Poe is justly admired for his wonderful stories, but I have to tell you he wrote a lot of penny a word trash too. Robert Louis Stevenson was by far his master, and he wrote per word too. He just wrote a lot less garbage. Don't get me wrong here, Poe was brilliant too, but fortunately, until I read volumes 1 through 3, I never knew the depths Poe had to sink to in order to make a living. Poor Poe. I'm sure he knew when he was writing drivel, but a man has to eat."
4,"Hard to mess up a classic, and you didn't !",Very nicely formatted for the Kindle. Got me back into reading the classic novles I rememberedf rom High school and Junior High.
3,Not for complete beginners!,"This is not a good book for those without any woodworking experience. There is too much jargon that is unexplained, and no real starting projects. I'm certain that there is excellent info for beginners who are looking to expand their knowledge and skills, but for people with no background who are looking for the most basic advice, I would look elsewhere."
3,"Watch out, newbies!","I didn't want to give this book a star rating, but they made me. I'm sure it's fine and very informative, but I caution readers, if you are looking for a real starter's guide, a sort of Woodworking for Dummies, don't get this book. The jargon starts on page one and never lets up. I hope in a few years I'll have learned enough to know what the hell they're talking about, and then I'm sure it will be useful. But right now? Very intimidating for newbies like me."
1,Never arrived,"Lost in shipment, had to get refund. 3rd party retail was good to offer other product as they were out of this."
3,Let Down,"Hey, I'm a big fan of the Big Bamboozler going back to his days as a Bad Seed. And while he has always been too self-concious to be the next Miles Davis, he has always been cool in his own way. Unfortunately, he seems to have lost his edge on King of Nothing Hill. It is still kind of cool, but no more cool than the occassional jazz songs Sesame Steet did in the 1970s (you know, like: 12345678...910). Only slightly more legit than the Shuffle Demons (a reference only Canadians will understand).Perhaps it's a self-parody?"
4,The Best Friend,"The Best Friend The setting in this book is many places like school, and at the main character's house. Those are the main two. The main character is Honey Perkins. She says that she is Becka Norwoods best friend. Becka says that she has never even meet Honey. The Plot of the story starts when Becka first meets Honey. When that happend Honey starts to follow Becka around. Honey also starts to dressing like Becka and even copying Becka's hair. Then honey starts appearing in Beckas room. I think that honey is stacking Becka,so that honey can embarrass Becka and steel all of Becka's friends. I recommend this book because it's scary and if you like scary this is the book for you. I give this book 4 stars."
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read!!!,"I loved this book. It was kind of boring near the beginning, but once I got into it, I really enjoyed it. I have read about 35 R.L. Stine books in the past 5 months and I've enjoyed every one of them. If you want to read a horror story, R.L. Stine is the one to read. I really enjoyed reading this and others by Stine and I think others will too, even if you haven't read much horror before, he will get you hooked."
3,I Don't Understand Why People Don't Like the Ending!!,"This book could have been a lot better. Although I first picked up the book and thought it had a good premise to it, it turned out to be pretty uneventful. UNTIL THE END!! It's been one of Stine's best endings. It's good to do something different and leave you hanging, because you can make up the ending you want! In almost every book you read, you know at the end the bad guy's gonna get caught and everyone lives happily ever after. You don't know, though, if everyone lives in peace at the end of this book. That way you can make up your own ending. Those are the kind of endings I like. My advice: Don't stop halfway through the book if you think it's boring; you may enjoy the ending!!"
1,I hated the ending!!!!!!,"it was good, with suspense and all that, but when I got to the end, I was shocked that the author just left me hanging. I really wanted to know what happened. I don't care if anyone dies, I just want to know what happens to Becka. I was relieved to see that a sequel was going to be put out, and also relieved when other people thought the same way about the ending."
2,THIS IS R.L. STINES WORST BOOK IN MY OPINION.,I LIKED HOW THE BOOK STARTED OFF BUT IT STARTED GETTING BORING IN THE END. I ALSO HATED THE ENDING. I HOPE THE SECOND IS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE FIRST.
2,lousy,"Ok this book was truly amazing , it gave me chills and it made me anxious to get to the end but that very ending disapointed me so much that well I don't thgink it's amazing anymaore. It's obvbious R.l was trying to be unique but he ended upbeing dumb. The ending was so horrid that R.L was forced to write a sequel."
4,To help you decide wether you should read it or not...,"The Best Friend is a creepy book about a girl named Becka whose new neighbor claims she and Becka are and always have been best friends. Slowly, Honey starts to drive Becka mad. She steals Becka's things and claims Becka gave them to her, wears Becka's clothes, even cuts her hair exactly like Becka's, and more horrible things! Then, when Becka lashes out at Honey and tries to cut her out of her life, th gruesome accidents begin. One by one, th epeople closest to Becka are being murdered. Is it Honey being jealous? Someone else? In the book it's obvious but the real shocker is the last page. I personally didn't like the ending, but that's why there's a sequel! It's worth reading, to answer your question."
3,Superbly written young adult thriller,"First R.L. Stine book I ever read. I'm way older than the target audience, which is probably why I didn't give it four or five stars. Stine is a master of plotting and suspense. Tells a great story, full of surprising twists and genuinely gripping plot points. Nothing weighty or brainy here. Just a great, entertaining light read."
5,AMAZING,This is a chilling book that leaves you wanting more. The climax is thru out the entire book. You need to buy this book. Also try goosebumps.
3,kinda ok....,"This book wuz ok... Even tho it wuz da kind of books that u HAFTA keep readin an' juss can't put down, it wuz still annoying!!! well not da book, but Honey!!! Holy man!!! If I wuz Becka, I would seriously KILL Honey!! Wut a weirdo!!! An' da endin wuz ok, I guess... but da most dissapointin thing in this book wuz that Stine didn't even tell us y Honey wuz after Becka an' thought that thay were best frends.... Overall... it wuz OK... but I think it wuz da worst FEAR STREET book I've ever read... da rest of da books r KEWL!!!"
2,Not one of his best.,"I love fear street books, but this one was not one of my favourites. It was very strange and just left you hanging there. I think that this book was very un-beleivable. I wouldn't recomend it over most of RL Stines books."
1,Pass on this one.,"Zero stars. This product does not live up to any level of dependability. I took this out of the box and tested it with with basic items (lb of butter, lb bag of rice) and it never once was accurate. I would just pass on this item."
4,"It may not be Railroad Tycoon 4, but it is still fun!","People are knocking this game down because it isn't as complex of a game as Railroad Tycoon. Last time I checked this game was not part of the Railroad tycoon series. This is a much simpler game to start and get into, as someone said earlier, more for the casual crowed. It is not bad for a game to be aimed for the casual crowd. I have played many hours with this game because it is a great time waster and if you're not looking for a hardcore sim, you might have some fun too."
3,Sid Meier's Railroads,"Everything as advertised. It is a fun and addictive game. Not an easy sim, but not too hard that it isn't enjoyable."
2,"You've disappointed me, Sid.","The rail system in this game stinks. Nothing like RailRoad Tycoon 1,2,or 3. Please make a patch were you can add/remove signals. Please make a patch where you can control signals.Oh yea... make a patch where the game doesn't crash.I've been a Sid Meier fan for years, but this has really disappointed me. I guess they were in a rush to come out before the PlayStation 3."
1,"Sid Meier, released this? THE Sid Meier of Civilization? Ok jokes over who really made this fluff?","IT IS SID??? Aha, aha, there is no God, ahahahahahahahaa aaaaahahahahah.{arriving men in white coats with nets force postponement of review for 48 hours or after sanity hearing.)"
4,So Awesome!,"I lean towards strategy and simulation/RTS rather than those shoot-em-up games or multiplayer worlds. I loooove this game! I think I'm addicted to it. It's fairly easy to learn but hard to master. There are various options you can choose to make the gameplay very easy to very difficult. If you're into the sim/tycoon-type games, I think you'll like this one!The downside: Before I played, I installed the latest patch (1.1). My PC is 2 to 4 times above the recommended specifications. Still, the game tends to crash a lot and at other points (usually when there's a lot of track laid by the end of a scenerio) there is a lot of lag. I do not have any problems of any sort with any other software- I have to blame this game for its own crashes. I would have chucked the CD out the window, but the game does have a very good auto-save (about once a minute or two) so it's tollerable."
2,An Old Railroad Tycoon player - disappointed,"Very disappointed that the entire emphasis seems to be on ""Great Graphics"", the orginal game was easier to actually manage and modify the simulation. This version seems to be lacking in top view management and ability to easily modify, the simulation. I also hate having to have to put the CD in every time I want to play it. I thought that type of thing went out in the 90's."
2,disappointing,I brought this game because I love sid meier's game but this has to be his worst game by far. Even the demo is confusing and boring. Game play is below par.
2,Coming from RR Tycoon 3,"This is nothing like Rail Road Tycoon 3. The graphics are GREAT, however, just a fraction of the game play and scenarios of the previous version. There are not that many locomotives (and no modern day ones), very disappointing. I wish they had put in more effort, seems like they quickly lost interest in the software, pushed it into the market, made one semi-patch and let her die. No official Windows 7 patch for a software with this release date it just wrong.I was able to play it with Windows 7, locating a .exe hack from the internet. Has been very stable."
4,Enjoyable Entertainment.,"I'm a big Sid fan and have always wanted to play this game since I played all of his others. I found it to be fun and enjoyable. It's not near as deep as the Civ series but offers some detail. The animations and graphics are great and sounds are pleasing enough. Overall, I find it to be great, light entertainment."
2,"Enjoyable, but buggy and SecuRom DRM ruins it (again)","Enjoyed the game - graphics are nice, and basic game play can be picked up very quickly. Unfortunately the DRM requires the disc and apparently an internet connection every time you play. What is worse is that the DRM occasionally decides the disc is a copy instead of the original and wont let you play. The game crashes from time to time for no apparent reason (I have installed the patch and have a PC *far* beyond requirements) and I suspect the DRM may be responsible.This is yet another game that I would probably play over and over if it weren't for SecuRom DRM restrictions (SecuRom version 7.30.0012). As a result, after a few days of play, I am about to uninstall the game and will probably never install it again, and will be far less likely to buy another Sid Meiers title again."
2,Keeps Crashing to Desktop,The Game is good until it crashes because there is too much going on. Each and everytime I get 25-30 years into the game it Crashes and sends me back to the desktop. Even after downloading and installing the patch that was supposed to fix this problem it still occurs.
4,Cool,"This is a good game. I will list some pros and cons:Pros: Many maps to choose from, lots of trains, train table mode (thats when there is no money or competitors, it's just like playing on a train table.)Cons: Well.... I can't think of any thing.Happy gaming!"
2,Sid Meier's Railroads,"I could really get into the game, but it keeps crashing. I don't know if its because my computer is using Windows Vista or other reasons. I have downloaded the only patch and it didn' help much. IF these problems could be fixed then this would be one of my favorite game."
1,Don't waste your money,Some cool features but not worth the frustration with all the glitches. Nothing a competent programmer could iron out
2,Sid runs one off the rails,"Sid Meier's Railroads is a frustrating experience, in part due to how great it is. While smaller in scope than the other railroad tycoon games in its genre, it is accessible yet deep enough to become one of those ""just one more hour"" games, even as the clock ticks past two in the morning.The problem is, the game has been plagued with crash-to-desktop errors that make playing the game difficult if not impossible. Generally, you can get about 20 minutes to half and hour before you're unceremoniously dumped to your desktop, which understandably dampers the play value of this title.Across 2 major patches, they have not been able to correct this, so unfortunately they seem unable to fix it. Therefore, I'm forced to pan this otherwise fun game."
3,"Fun, but limited... and a few gotcha's","A fun game, once you get it to work a little. (Beware, this game uses a very new version of SecuROM, and if you have a DVD/CD drive attached to a SATA line, it will not play.) The game gets a bit old after a short while, it is not as in depth as previous Railroad Tycoon titles. Seems almost ""dumbed down"", which is a shame since I loved the original and I was hoping this one would recapture some of that original flavor. All in all, wait for it to hit the bargain bin."
2,Disapointed,"Very much. Railroad Tycoon gamers, beware! This game is very different from the original RT games!!!"
2,The wait was not worth it,"I waited months for this game to come out. I can't add anymore than what has been said by others. I wonder how ""hands on"" Sid was with it. Could be a long time before a great train game will be coming out, if ever."
2,"It's fun for kids, lacking for adults.","The game has a good look and is very easy to play. I bought it when it first came out and realized that the 49.99 price tag was way over priced. My daughter who was 6 at the time got a real kick out of the game. It's just too bad there weren't free content updates to the game. It is like a little train set in your home without taking up all the space. As was said in another review, ""we expected more from Sid."" He doesn't care though, he has the money to not care."
3,Railroads!,"Was a fan of the original back in the day. This latest version is great as far as graphics although I think there is still much to improve on. For instance, most play seemed very guided as to what you had to accomplish with very little ""free"" play to do your own thing. This is the main thing I loved about the original. All in all, it's a good game, learning curve is easy for newbies or old timers like me that remember the original."
3,Railroads by Sid meyer,This is a fun program. It is extremely complex and the only challenge is that it crashes at times in the midle of a very complex railroad construction. It is keeping me up late at night as I beat those Robber barons from competing railroads!
4,Great Game,I have played all the RRT games and this has been the most enjoyable by far. The game may not be perfect but it is addictive with outstanding graphics and animation. I bought mine when it first came out and I have to admit that those $36.00 have given me a ton of entertainment throughout the years. What I fear is that this might be the last of this genre as most game players these days seem to prefer the shoot out and sci-fi games rather than the smart strategy games such as SMR.
3,"And oldie but a goodie, but still too old","This is a great game to take you back to the golden age of Sid Meier's work, but the game lacks several key advances that could've made it a five star game.For one, the maps are entirely too small. The cities are very, very close and most of the time, the train is in both cities at the same time! You can't enjoy long-hauls between cities except from one end of the map to the other and even that is far too short.The game's zoom level is also inhibiting. You can't zoom out to see the entire map and watch all the action. You can only zoom out enough to see maybe three cities at the most.Good game, but needs far, far larger maps.Check out ""Trainz 2006"" for a more life-like railroading/modeling experience complete with an entire community to swap layouts, buildings, people, cars, locos, frieght, and so much more."
3,Great Start - Could've Been Much Better,"The game is fairly addicting. The graphics are very nice, the sound is nice. But the game is too simple for adults. In about 10 hours of game play you know just about everything. This game needs more dimensions.Where is the campaign mode? How come I can buy and industry but can't sell it? Why do tracks get built instantly? They should take some amount of time to be built. How about sabotaging other people's tracks? Need a little bit more dimension to this game.Finally, the game is WAY too buggy. I'm using 1.01 and it crashes regularly. Examining task manager shows that its eating 500MB of RAM!"
2,Waste of Time and Money...,"Just in time for Christmas!Several significant steps backward with this game, as compared to RRT3...The economic engine is simpler and less entertaining than RRT3.Having to install and operate signals is a real throwback, eliminated in RRT3.The graphics start out fun and cute, but quickly get old.It is not as challenging as RRT3 from a business sim perspective.As someone here says, it's NOT RRT4..."
2,What a let down!,I loved Railroad Tycoon and all the other various railroad games. But this one... it's just awful. It lacks the depth of the prior games and fails to behave like a simulation. Best best description of it is that it is a poor arcade game.Go play the Railroad Tycoon series and skip this one.
3,BounceBack Express Software,"External drive seems to work fine using it with Windows XP. However, when I try and load the BounceBack Express software, it begins to load and then when searching for the drives it ""freezes up"" and becomes ""non-responding"". I have it hooked up through the Firewire with the drive as a FAT32. Seems like if it works without the software, it isn't a hardware issue yet CMS tells me to hook it up through USB (which I haven't tried yet). Anyone have any solutions?"
1,Stopped working after 6 months,My Seagate drive just stopped working after 6 months. I found their technical support useless - they didn't even bother to read my symptoms - and their return process was a wreck.
1,Failed After 4 Days !,"I took approximaly 5 hours to back up ~ 20 G of hard drive information using the fire wire interface. The software was easy to use, Although none of this really matters since the hard drive was no longer recognized by any of my 3 computers after 4 days! Not wanting to give away 20 G of hard drive data (i.e. by sending it back for repairs) it was a complete waste of $190 not to mention my time."
1,Bricked after 2 months,Doesn't come with decent back up software (would often say the drive was full when i had 100GB left.) And then to top it off -- the drive just stopped after less than 2 months! I've plugged and replugged it to no avail. Thank god i didn't have a crash as my backup would be gone.
1,Buggy drive not ready for market,"Unfortunately I didn't heed the various negative reviews on this drive. Formatted it to NTFS as soon as it arrived. In just a few days, Delayed Write Errors started showing up, caused by the drive randomly disconnecting itself from Windows XP. Called Seagate on the problem, only to have the technician admit they have had rampant problems with this drive. Their Engineering Dept is still trying to figure out what is wrong -- they promised to call me back on the issue, but have not done so. I have returned the drive to Amazon for credit. Stick with the 160GB or 200GB Seagate USB 2.0/Firewire external drives -- I have three of those and never had a problem with them!"
1,Do not buy these drives!,"Our organization ordered 2 of these drives and 2 of the 400 GB variety of these drives. All 4 of them experienced write problems as indicated in the previous reviews.The drive would be just humming along fine, and then suddenly write errors would start popping up in the system log.We experienced these problems with both linux using the 2.4 kernel and Mac OS X. Based on the previous reviews here, and my own experience with 4 of the drives under two different operating systems/machine architectures I can only conclude that these drives have some serious design/engineering problems and should definitely be avoided."
