1,automatic omron blood pressure monitor,"MY MONITOR SEEMS TO BE CALIBRATED TO READ TOO LOW. I AM A REGISTERED NURSE, SO I KNOW HOWTO TAKE A BLOOD PRESSURE, BUT WHEN I TAKE MY BLOOD PRESSURE WITH THE AUTOMATIC MONITORIT IS CONSISTANTLY APP. 20 POINTS LOWER THAN WHEN I TAKE MY BLOOD PRESSURE WITH MY MANUALBLOOD PRESSURE CUFF. I HAVE TRIED CALLING THE PHONE NUMBER ON THE INSTRUCTION SHEET FOUNDIN THE BOX MY MONITOR CAME IN. I EVEN WENT ON-LINE, BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO TALK TO ANYONE.ALL I WAS ABLE TO GET WAS A RECORDING. I HAVE JUST GONE BACK TO USING MY MANUAL CUFF ANDSTETHOSCOPE."
5,Professional Quality,"this sphygmomanometer is a quality item. The cuff is preformed to curve around your arm comfortably. The air hose is sturdy with a large and easy to handle connector button that makes it easy to remove it from and insert it into the pump mechanism. In operation, the pump mechanism is whisper quiet and the digital readout displays large, crisp, easy to read, numerals and icons.The Start/Stop button is large and easy to manipulate, but positioned to prevent accidental starting of the machine. The adhesive backed cover sheet that is included and is intended as a mask for the readout, was so unintuitive and would have covered so much of the display that I just left it off (all of the pictures of the device show it being used without the use of that cover sheet). instructions for proper use are prominently displayed on the Arm cuff and are easy to read and understand.This is a very well thought-out and ergonomically designed piece of equipment."
1,NOT RECOMMEND THIS MODEL,"This model of BP machine by Omron has a flaw. I ordered it, had to return it for a replacement of the same style. It did not work. The same style form a local drug store did not work either. I ended up purchsing a different model from Omron that works fine. It seems to be the ones with the blue round connector plug that do not allow the pressure to build up enough in the monitor to get a reading at all. I would not recommend this model. Omron, otherwise, has a great line of products."
5,How exciting can a BP cuff be,The BP monitor came as advertised. Very easy to read and the averaging feature is great.
4,Staying Healthy,"I have recently been diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure). I researched the issue of buying a blood pressure monitor for about three days. I settled on the Omron HEM-780 N3. It has served me well so far.This unit will do three tests, average them and display the results. I like this feature. Over all you get more accurate results.The price I paid was very reasonable. I am pleased with my purchase. I recommend this unit to all who want and need a top notch blood pressure monitor."
1,Inconsistent readings,I do not recommend. Cuff is clumsy and awkward to use compared to other Omron cuffs. Readings are inconsistent.
5,Excellent,"I can't imagine any improvements to this product. It is consistent, repeatable, and generally quite in line with my doctor's readings and my wife's as well. Easy to use. Comfortable. What a bargain."
5,Blood Pressure Monitor,"There is a degree of simplicity, when combined with accuracy and efficiency, which makes this device a pleasure to use. I could not be any more pleased relative to both quality and pricing. Highest recommendation."
3,Sensitive to height but consistent,"What it is: Automated BP measuring device with 2 sets of memories for 2 users. Can perform statistical analysis of retained readings. Includes ability to sense arrhythmia.This BP monitor can do a good job. But you have to be careful. I've got one that gives consistent readings. It usually says I have high BP; 15 to 20 points higher than the doc's office.How you sit with the machine makes a huge difference. Sitting upright in a chair I will get readings 20 points higher than if I sit such that my arm is resting on a table even with or a little above my heart. The lower readings are actually only a tiny bit lower than what is usually seen at the doc's office, sitting up. This doesn't mean it's bad, it just means I have to keep in mind it reads high."
4,Accurate and intuitive,"Just received, put it together and checked BP without even readng the instructions. Compared to a manual reading, accurate with in 6mm hg. Even comes with batteries. Over all a great monitor and one I would recommend for my patients.(Only 4 stars as it is a little bit expensive...I think keeping my blood pressure under control requires accurate measurements and thus is worth the price)"
3,Too big for travel,"I travel frequently and need to bring a bpm with me. The wrist ones are too unreliable. I tried this unit...seems accurate but it is the biggest unit I've seen. Also, the cuff will not lay flat like traditional units.Even if I didn't travel, I would have returned this. I get an error message on about 40% of my tries...presumably due to cuff placement. Frustrating."
1,Not as expected,"I do not like the cuff. It is not easy to use and does not seem to fit my arm correctly. It is supposed to be my size. If I were you, I would not buy this product. I am very disapointed!"
1,Defective,"I ordered this monitor because of ratings in Consumer Reports and my Dr.'s advice. With the batteries only my pressure was showing very strange numbers so I took it with me to my Dr. She plugged it in rather than rely on batteries, and it was better but subsequent readings were all over the place and it also indicated peculiar heart rates. I took it in again because I had recently changed medication and wanted a correct reading and again it was all over the place so I'm returning it on her advice. She put the cuff on me herself more than once. I hadn't saved the receipt nor the box but Amazon is great about returns."
3,Blood Pressure Monitor,"Overall, the monitor seems to do what it is designed to do. It has several nice features, ie: averaging readings, memory function, and keeping track of readings from two people. However, the unit is fairly large and the pre-formed cuff design is advertised as a big positive, but instead is very user-unfriendly and is the reason I rated it 3 stars instead of 5."
3,works half the time,"Have owned this uuit for about a year had to send the first one back because it quit working, the new one will inflate and then say error about 40% of the time. It's very annoying and at this price makes this unit a waste of time for someone who has to use it daily."
1,The unit I bought was defective,"I have been keeping check of my blood pressure with an old fashioned mannual unit for years, so when my systolic and diastolic readings were consistantly 10 points lower with the new unit than with my old unit, and with my doctor's readings, I was suspicious. I then went to a drug store and purchased a new manual unit, and it's readings were consistant with my old manual unit. I returned the Omron unit to Amazon and requested a refund."
5,Excellent Item,"I've purchased several of these units after using them as loaner devices for my medical practice. Easy to use, large display, built in memory device in case one forgot to log reading. Had to purchase one replacement cuff as a result of it reporting an air leak (office unit) but for home usage I highly recommend it. Cuff has firm, molded section that ""snaps"" onto your arm and you then use your other arm to wrap remainder of cuff into place. Plug hose from cuff into side of unit, plug into wall plug or add batteries, press ""start"" and you're taking a blood pressure. Just make sure you align the cuff correctly to take an accurate reading."
4,omron HEM-780 B.P. monitorThis product,"this product works well, however i had difficulty getting the memory feature to work for me"
3,The jury is still out on this one....,"While this monitor is extremely easy to use, we continue to be confused by the great variation in readings we get. Often, if we take my husband's blood pressure on the same arm several times, we get widely varying results. At this point we are satisfied if one of those readings is not really out of line but I would like to see more consistent readings."
1,Inaccurate reading,I bought this product from amazon.com. The only way to know the unit is giving an accurate reading it to take it to a doctor and campare the reading with the doctor's blood pressure monitor every few month! Both for me and my wife we found our blood pressue reading is not matching with our doctor's reading. You might think your blood pressure is okay and you are healthy according to this machine but in reality you are suffering from high blood pressure or low blood presuure. So due to this machine you may end up with a serious untreated heart problem. Never rely on this blood pressure monitor.
1,Inconsistant readings.,"It's readings were all over the board. It showed lower than average blood pressure readings when in fact, when checked at the fire department my blood pressure was very high."
1,Not all that good,"I bought this item because of it's Great reviews of easy use and accuracy. I am not sure of its accuracy, yet. But it is certainly not easy to use. Both my wife and I use it and we have to help each outer put it on. They say it has a ""Comfit Cuff"" It is anything but comfortable or easy to use. I will continue to try to use it, but if I had it to do over, I would not buy this BP Monitor."
3,inaccurate,"it reads too low, when the manual pump type reads 100 this reads 88, it was measured by a rn and a doctoe and it always read too low, by 10 points very inaccurate, and the start stop button is touchy, have to press the exact spot, waste of money"
1,very inaccurate performance of the Emron Premium HEM-780,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit CuffI have had this unit for less than a month and have yet to get an accurate reading. I used it in the guest mode.I continually get readings in the range of 144/76 to 149/79 20% above my normal range. I belong to the cardiac rehab. unit at Northwest Hosp. in Arlington Hts. IL. and frequently have live BP tests. They range from 127/62 to 132/64. One live BP check of 120/60 was followed by your Omron check of 145/78.I've given up using the Omron unit and have gone back to my Lumiscope BP unit which is over 15 years old but much more accurate than the Omron which I find totally useless.I appreciate your asking my opinion. Can you advise me how to return the Omron?
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!,I have had this paper weight for 5 months now. I can not get it to read me more than once or twice a month.For the first few weeks I literally tried 25-30 times a night because I was assured it was a good one.I searched the internet for clues. I emailed the company with no replies.I reposition the cuff over and over and over to no avail. I still try an average of ten times a night now because I am supposed to monitor morning afternoon and evening. Most days I get nothing but errors.The pharmacy won't take it back but they couldn't get it to read me either. We opened three other boxes there with the same results.
5,value of Omron monitor,I am completel;y satisfied with my purchase of the Omron 780 blood presure monitor. It works perfectly and is very easy to use.
5,Omron HEM-789 BP Monitor,Accurate and very easy to use. It has a memory feature which is beneficial if one needs to keep a record.
5,Something that could save your life!,"A great product to have in the home for daily use. After being diagnosed with higher than normal blood pressure (which was brought down to acceptable levels by a little more exercise) I bought an earlier model and monitored my BP and pulse on a daily basis. By doing this I caught a heart problem that suddenly developed over the Christmas period that resulted in a high pulse rate and low BP. There were really no noticeable indications of the condition apart from what was indicated by the monitor, but if left untreated could have resulted in serious heart damage. I bought a second one to use when I'm traveling. I'm a believer."
1,Slow shipping on repairs,"I sent in my unit for recalibration for the second time in three years last week and the unit came back with a good bill of health, but the cuff was shot. (The first time the unit was out of calibration a little).You need to replace the cuff every 12 months if you use it twice a day, and every 18 months if you use it less (about $30 w/shipping).When I send the unit in for calibration, I send it 2-day express with the required five dollars, but they only send it back on ground transportation. What good is that? - way too slow. They need need to have an extra-cost option to send it back 2-day express for an extra fee.I have to go to the drug store day and night now due to this inconvenience. Their Customer Service wants me to buy another one of their units as a backup while the first one is in the mail. What a way to sell more product!It's a very good unit, but it needs to be downgraded because of the slow return shipping."
2,very disappointed,"I've found this unit difficult to use. Flashes E about 2 out of 5 times. Cuff is difficult to place in the proper position on either arm. It consistently registers 14 - 20 difference from Dr.'s office monitor. Comparisons were made in the Dr.s office and under her supervision. Even though Consumer Reports has it highly rated I did not find it accurate or easy to use. Would that it were not so. However, it is what it is."
1,Blood Pressure Monitor,"Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit CuffI was very disappointed with thia item, which did not perform as expected.The cuff was difficult to apply by one person, without assistance.When it was correctly applied, following instructions, it either failed to inflate properly and gave an error reading or it over-inflated (very painfully) and gave very high incorrect readings. I had these readings checke for comparison by a professional.Professionals must have their monitors checked and corrected frequently foraccuracy. As a casual user, I had no facilites to perform this function.I have returned the monitor for refund.Margaret Corder3271 Samuel RoadAkron, Ohio, 44312"
4,Review of Omron HEM-780 Blood Pressure Cuff,"It is what I was looking for and it does the job. However, the memory mode for maintaining the ""over-time"" data is not intuitively obvious. Still, it get's the job done."
5,Omron HEM-780 is easy to use and accurate!,"I wish I had this product BEFORE being diagnosed with level 5 kidney failure. Taking my blood pressure several times a day is now a part of my daily routine. Using the HEM-780 is really simple, and it keeps track of your usage too. Don't forget your blood pressure. They don't call it the silent killer for nothing!Mark MacLeodWaukegan, Illinois."
5,"Tested, Recommended","As a physician, I've using myself many BP monitors. And others, that my patients bring to the office to check. So far this is just the best.Accurate, long batteries life, not too big to get mobile, easy to master.Big cuff, for heavier patients where others BP fail. This one stays steady.Great choice"
5,Easy to use.,Ordered for my wife and I. Product came in just a few days. Works just as discribed and am very satisfied. Much better than the old one we had. Definitely would recommend.
5,BP Monitor,"Good Value,Easy to use, large easy to read #s, records data for two. Works great on batteries or 110V adapter (both included)."
4,Pleased with BP Monitor,I am very satisfied with this monitor. It's easier than having someone else do it. I like that it keeps up with two people also.
5,Great product,"This is a great product - easy to use and reliable. Great that you can save a history of readings, as well."
5,Omron HEM-780 Blood Pressure Review,"Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit CuffI focused on Omron per a physician's suggestion. From a price and option point of view, the HEM-780 seemed to be a good deal for less than $60. I actually purchased the monitor because my spouse thought she had high blood pressure, whereas I did not. The good news is that the HEM-780 performed like a charm and my spouse's blood pressure was normal except when she had an anxiety attack. The bad news is that my blood pressure was a little too high. I'd recommend the product to anyone looking for a good quality meter."
4,Omron HEM 780 Automatic BP Monitor,"The HEM 780 is as advertised. It's primary use as a BP monitor is easy and the screen's large presentation is easily read. However, some other functions such as changing the date, require the instructions so don't lose them. There is nothing intuitive about changing the date. All and all, this seems to be a very good monitor."
4,Omron HEM-780,"Unit works very well, although it consistently reads slightly high. Well worth the purchase price."
5,Good Product - User Friendly,"I was amazed I could buy a blood pressure monitor at such a good price. Now that I have used it, I am equally amazed with the quality of the product and how easy it is to use."
5,"Cathy, New Orleans",This bp cuff is very easy to use. Setup was also very easy. I chose this one because it stores info that I can bring to my next Dr.'s appointment. [...].
4,Omron HEM Blood Pressure Cuff,As a recent cardiac patient I wanted to be able to monitor my blood pressure at home. My wife wanted to monitor hers as well. We have found the Omron easy to use and convenient. It operates well on the batteries which helps in certain settings where it is not feasible to locate near a plug. At the cardiac rehabilitation center where I am being treated I compared the Omron reading with the equipment at the facility. It compared favorably. It is easy to store in the storage case which comes with the unit.
3,B P Cuff,"The machine itself seems to be fairly accurate however, its the its the most difficult & frustrating B P Monitor i've ever used (I've owned several). It sometimes takes 3 0r 4 attempts before you can get past the ""E for error"" mode. This is due to the bad design of the Cuff. You need a second person to help get the cuff snug enough to work. Another problem is the length of the hose between the machine and the cuff. Its verys short!J.E.Dodd"
5,Omron HEM-780,"My blood pressure has been slowly climing over the past 3 years. I went and saw my Doctor, and he gave me the name of a few differant blood pressure monitor manufactures. I went with the Omron HEM-780 on reviews that I read on line on all the ones that my Doctor suggested. I didn't need the 2 person monitering, because my wifes blood pressure is good. I bought it because it can be used by 2 persons and it is so easy to use. I measure my pressure in the morning and in the early evening. I take it to the Doctors office when I go so he can see the results. I would recommend this monitor to anyone needing one. It's easy to use, easy to read, and accurate! Again highly recommended!!!!!"
2,Not Accurate,This blood pressure monitor didn't work for me. The measurements I get are much higher than those I get in my doctor's office so I have to believe that it's not accurate.
4,Good Product,"This is a really easy to use and accurate blood pressure monitor. The only negative (and it is not insignificant) is the unit's memory. Unfortunately, only one person can use the unit if you plan on doing any type of historical tracking. The problem lies in the fact there is not a way to store tests for multiple users. Every test is automatically added to the memory and you cannot delete a specific test, only all tests."
2,Not very calibrated to dr's,I bought this based on all the great reviews here and I just wouldn't buy it again. I'm not getting readings even close to that of the dr. I've brought mine in to the internist as well as the cardiologist and it's typically higher for both systolic and diastolic than the dr readings. I gave it 2 stars because it's better than nothing and I can't return it now.
2,OMRON COMFIT CUFF,"THE COMFIT CUFF DOES NOT FIT PEOPLE WITH A SMALLER ARM. I HAVE TO HOLD THE CUFF WITH MY FINGER WHILE IT INFLATES OR IT STOPS AND SAYS THE CUFF IS TO LOOSE. THEY SHOULD OFFER DIFFERENT SIZE CUFFS, AS ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. I SENT AN E-MAIL TO THE COMPANY A FEW DAYS AGO, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN ANSWER TO MY REQUEST. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT."
4,very good value,this blood pressure machine is a very good value. Only 1 problem with it is that it is hard to manuever with 1 hand to close the velco cuff. reveived many error readings but have since worked around it by tightning up between readings.. excellent item for the price
2,Completely inaccurate,"I was using this casually and was happy with the features and apparent high quality. It showed my pressure a bit high, which is what I expected. Sometimes it would provide a wildly wrong reading. Then I took it to my doctor to compare to his ""live"" measurements. Well, the monitor was way off. Doctor was telling me 122/82 and the monitor was 130/95. We tried it several times and each time it was wildly different. So now I am very disappointed because I can't rely on it. What use is it? My advice: As soon as you get your monitor, take it to a doctor or nurse and confirm that it's accurate. If it's not, return it right away."
1,Very Inaccurate,"This unit was compared to a routine manual unit in a physician's office. The Omron unit consistently recorded the systolic BP about 40 mm BELOW actual level and recorded diastolic BP about 15 mm below the actual level.I would not recommend this unit and will not purchase again.RVCHilton Head Island, SC"
1,totally inaccurate,This blood pressure meter is totally inaccurate. I am a physician.I checked my own blood pressure and the readings were completely inaccurate and were fluctuating wildly. Mostly the readings were way too low. I checked the blood pressure of a few other people with similar bad results. I went to the hospital to double-check with a calibrated blood pressure meter. The reading of the Omron HEM-780 were completely off. I has chosen this blood pressure meter based on good reviews including a few from physicians but was very disappointed to see that this meter does not work correctly.I am returning it.
3,Cuff Doesn't Fit,The cuff that came with the machine does not fit as it is too large and gives a false reading. My trainer is trying to get me a smaller cuff but it is a little disappointing as I don't remember being offerred an option on cuff size. Any help you can give me would be appreciated. As of yet I cannot use the blood pressure machine. I think you should address this issue. Thanks for your interest. Ruth Wilkerson
4,Omron HEM-780 blood pressure monitor,The Omron HEM-780 blood pressure monitor provides accurate and consistent readings. The cuff is spring loaded to position it on your arm quickly and easily and it accomodates a wide range of upper arm size.
2,OMRON REPLACEMENT POLICY,"I had to return this product because it was giving wrong readings, both systolic and dystolic reading were off by +20 mHg. This was verified by two doctors office visits. I called OMRON to JUST REPLACE IT but they gave me hard time and asked me to do several steps to reverify the readings. I was fortunate to have this unit bought thru AMAZON. It was very easy prepaid return process if returned within a specified time. I bought OMRON because doctors recommendations. I think OMRON should have replaced it without questions as long as it was under warranty and specially only 3 weeks old unit."
1,Readings are not accurate.,"I am highly disappointed with this product. I tried several times, but the readings are different every time I check. I feel like I wasted my money. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
3,Results Vary from Dr.'s Office,I purchased this for my husband but have been using and comparing to my own readings at my dr.'s office. It's somewhat close but not exact according to the readings that I have been getting at the dr.'s office. It seems to be more accurate on the left arm than the right. It is easy to use and has a lot of nice features but I don't trust it 100%
5,Our purchase through Amazon,"The item works well, as expected, and was delivered in a reasonable time. We are pleased with our purchase."
1,Inaccurate readings,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit CuffThe readings were inaccurate - much higher than in actuality. We compared to 2 different doctors who used a sphygomometer. There is no point in buying this if you can not depend on the readings.
2,Incorrect Readings,The Monitor is easy to use but does not read correctly. I have checked the readings several times with different doctors because the readings are high enough to alarm me. The readings by the doctors say that my blood pressure is in the normal range.I am going to return this cuff as it of no use.
1,Not the unit shown in picture,The actual unit received is not the unit shown in the picture but an older model. The unit looks nicely made and seems to work well at a good price.But I find the practice of shipping a unit different from the one shown both deceptive and unethical.
1,"Good ""2 person"" machine",This is an excellent machine IF you have someone else to help you put the cuff on. Machine will not work unless the cuff is tight. With the very stiff cuff; the more you pull to tighten it the more it just slips around your arm. You MUST have someone hold it still while you pull it tight. Lots of whistles and bells but no good if your trying to take your own blood pressure.
2,Review of Blood Pressure Monitor,"The monitor provided more than I expected, particularly with the storing of, I believe a 100 readings, and also the averaging of the last three readings. The latter enables me to take three readings at one sitting and then obtain the average of the three readings. The only negative is the cuff that has some sharp edges."
4,OVER PRICED,A FAMILY MEMBER RECOMMENDED IT AS THE TOP SELECTION OF CONSUMER REPORTS. ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON.COM WITHOUT ANY FURTHER INVESTIGATION FALSELY THINKING YOU CAN'T GO WRONG ON PRICING AND SERVICE WITH SUCH A DEPENDABLE VENDOR - A BIG MISTAKE. ITEM WAS DELIVERED WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX SCOTCH TAPED SHUT (AFTER BEING OPENED?) WHICH DIMINISHES CONFIDENCE IN IT BEING BRAND NEW AND UNTAMPERED WITH. I REGISTERED THE PRODUCT WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY WERE SELLING IT ON-LINE FOR OVER $40 DOLLARS LESS. THE VENDOR FROM AMAZON WAS MED-ICAL AND SURGICAL SUPPLIES WHO EMAILED ME AFTER SUBMITTING A SIMILAR REVIEW THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NEW AND TAPED WHEN THEY STACK THEM??? AND THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CHARGE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. I'M VERY VERY SURPRISED AMAZON DEALS WITH THIS TYPE OF VENDOR. I GIVE THE PRODUCT 4 STARS AND AMAZON AND MED-ICAL AND SURGICAL SUPPLIES ABSOLUTELY NO STARS.
2,OMROM &*) BP METER,IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THIS CUFF ON THIS BP METER YOU ALMOST NEED TWO PEOPLE TO USE IT.
2,Omron Blood pressure monitor,Haven't had any experience with this sort of device before but went by Consumer Reports recommendations. Easy to use and hope its accurate!
1,This thing is garbage.,"Barely seven months after I bought this machine, it died. I'll never buy one again."
4,User-friendly & useful features,"Features I like that my old machine didn't have: Will automatically run through 3 consecutive readings. You set the time delay interval between them. Then it displays the average of the three and stores it in memory. Will record and keep separate the morning readings (4am to 10am) and/or the evening readings (7pm to 10pm). Not sure about afternoon readings. The gap is from 10am to 7pm, a common period for us retired folks to be taking our B/P. Seems curious. Nonetheless, a great gadget!"
3,Ouch!,I found the Comfit Cuff to be anything but comfortable. It is hard to put on my upper arm. Many times it will not read because I didn't have it on the right way. Taking your blood pressure it never that great but this leaves my arm aching and sore afterwards.
5,OMRON HEM-780 Blood Pressure Monitoring Made Easy!,"This is an excellant product! We looked at other monitors that were certified for accuracy had some of its features, but the OMRON HEM-780 was the only one that had everything we wanted and the certified accuracy.The large readout is great! The intellisense inflation makes measuring simple and easy. My husband and I can each store our own readings, but we can accomodate a guest, too. The ComFit cuff is easy to use and eliminates the need for a small cuff for me and a larger cuff for my husband. We highly recommend this unit."
5,Good Product Great Price,Got this BPM for about $40 after all the specials. Works good consitant readings. Shipped quickly......................... good stuff.
1,It doesn't work,"I bought this a few weeks ago. I love the readout but it is very inaccurate. I took my blood pressure 3 times on the same day and the bp will read 135 the first time, 124 the second time, and 115 the third time. CRAZY!!! I tried it on all my family members and the same story. What a HUGE waste of money."
2,Too tight for my mother's arm,"I got this for my mother who is in her 70's. It was too tight when expanded for the length of time this unit takes to measure BP. She is 150 pounds, although she is not skinny her arm's circumference is 11 inches, of average adult width. Their wrist one was easier to use, more comfortable, and very accurate."
5,Ease of operation and Superior accuracy in measurement,The Omron product is really nice to handle. The manual instructions are simple. The readings shown in the display are large and accurate. The comfit technology is really great as it inflates and deflates as needed.It is highly recommended for Home Blood Pressure measurement.
1,too hard to position,"I bought this several months ago and should have sent it back immediateky, but didn't do so. I had a great deal of trouble positioning the cuff properly. It would start taking the reading and then stop in the middle. After a short time I just stopped using it. I was just taken off blood pressure medication, told to monitor my pressure, and I took the Hem-780 out of retirement. I still can't use it easily. I have to try 6 or 7 times before it completes the whole process and by then, I don't think the reading is accurate."
4,More than a monitor,I thought I was ordering a simplistic B/P monitor but it has the heplful feature of keeping an average of the readings that is easy to access and it does this for a second person!! A real plus!
4,Easy check for health,I have used the Omron Blood Pressure machine for a few weeks and find it to be very efficient. It will give pressure and pulse accuratly and is easy to use The results come fast and easy to read. I recommend it for any one desiring frequent recordings.
4,a sound investment,"So glad I finally purchased a blood pressure monitor. Have had several heart and BP issues and concerns over past few years and now I can keep track of how things are going. In past have had to rely upon machines in pharmacy or other places. I now can keep regular track of heart. In addition, or perhaps more importantly, now I have a regular routine of checking and taking the medicine I am supposed to take. Only takes a few minutes.When I compared my readings to doctors office, I found Omron to be about 6 points higher that doctors device on BP. Wish it were better, but not enough of a problem that I am worried.As always, dealing with Amazon is rock solid experience for me."
2,High Readings on Large Arm,"Very high readings using ComFit CUFF on large arm. Compared readings @ Doctors office and found Omron HEM-780 readings much higher. Readings on smaller arm appears to be ok. The BP monitor itself works well and is easy to use. Would not recommend product for use on larger arms (13""-17"")."
4,does the job.,"I have big arms, and this almost does not fit to well, and will get an error code. And I need to do it several times.But from what I hear is that the wrist ones work just as well, and a little bit cheaper. If I had to get another one it would be the smaller wrist monitor."
3,I am confuse,I do know if I have lower blood pressure. when I try this one for myself its display is 118/75. So I just give 3 stars. Should I bring this to see the family doctor?
5,great product,"This is extremely easy to use, and it is great that you can store your own readings, yet still have others in the household use it to check their blood pressure too.The case is nice, and the band is comfortable"
3,What do you want,Cuff is stiff and it really needs to be tight or it will not work. Sometimes difficult for one person to get it tight
4,This is GREAT!,"Easiest-to-use blood-pressure/pulse cuff I've ever seen. Right out of the box, without looking at the directions, I was able to assemble and use with no problems."
2,Omron HEM-780N3 - 8 to 12 higher reading,"This BPM is convenient to use, does quick measurements and provides comfortable pressure while during the measurement. However, compared to a manual reading with a sphygmanometer, the HEM-780N3 is around 8 to 12 mercury higher. I called technical support to inquire if they can tell me how to calibrate the reading but they gave me a scripted answer of how their manufacturing uses advanced calibration and that their machine is accurate. Well, the one I received was not accurate. I have compared it with another Omron and CVS BPMs and with a sphygmanometer. If not for the accuracy, this would have been a very good BPM."
3,lasted less than 3 years,We purchased the HEM-780 blood pressure monitor in May/ 2009 and it failed in Feb /2012; the pump could not generate pressures above 80 mm Hg. It was highly rated and seemed to be reasonably accurate until it failed.
2,Unreliable,"I used this device intermittently over the past year. About 6 months ago I discovered that it was failing to inflate the cuff properly (got an error after about 6-7 seconds), so I contacted Omron and they sent a new cuff. Didn't work. Since then, repeated problems despite being VERY careful about cuff placement, checking for no cuff leaks, etc. I am also a bioengineer with 40 years of experience - 15 of which were spent in developing blood pressure instrumentation.Troubleshooting myself, I discovered that if I artificially squeeze the cuff to allow the pressure to go over about 14 mm Hg during inflation before 6-7 seconds elapses, I can get it to inflate. However, I now cannot even get the device DESPITE THE CUFF BEING TIGHT AROUND MY ARM to inflate properly - or to not ""time out"".Overall comment - unreliable device. Never should fail so shortly, Omron's Quality Assurance is likely faulty."
1,Inferior product and non responsive company,"I found product to be unreliable after 5 months use and when LCD screen malfunctioned, I returned the the product to Omron for repair. It was returned in the same condition, with the LCD screen unreadable. The report stated that after a complete check on unit, no adjustments were needed. Unit working per specifications. I spent $9.00 to send the unit back, and sent a check for $8.00 for the return. I called Omron and was told there was no manufacturing defect and the fact that the LCD screen was unreadable was not something that they could correct. This is not the way to stand behind your product and I would recommend not to buy a product from Omron."
2,Lots of error readings,I get a lot of error readings indicating incorrect cuff pressure. I've learned to not bother making any cuff adjustments; just turn it off and then on again until it gives you a reading. What should be a simple deal becomes a time consuming ordeal; every once in a while it will give a reading on the first try. In the multiple reading averaging mode it consumed much more time than I had to devote to getting a decent BP reading.
3,blood pressure monitor,"For me the product was more than I needed: it figures the average BP for two separate persons in addition to a single reading for a ""guest,"" among other features. Perhaps a less sophisticated version would suffice.My main objection is the cuff. Directions say to: ""Wrap the cuff firmly in place around your arm using the cloth strip."" Though I judge myself of normal size and ability, I am unable to do this with one hand with any consistency. Error readings and widely different readings result. With time and practice, I trust this will work itself out. In the meantime, I check the Omron readings with my old Black and Decker monitor."
3,not for skinny people,"I bought this for my grandmother ... the arm pad has a tight band around it (to keep it in shape I guess) and is not good if you are a skinny person. As far as the accuracy is concerned, it's ok in that department. No digital checker is better than the manual one.If the blood pressure was ever concerning, i always checked it with a manual checker (with a stethoscope), before relying on the digital version,"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this because of all the good reviews; however, when I took my BP, it seemed VERY high. I had it checked when I went to the doctor. Compared to his reading, the bottom number was off by 12 points. (The top number was off also). I called Omron Customer Service and we tried resetting it over the phone. She told me to check the readings that evening and if they were still high, send it in FOR REPAIR. Repair?? It's brand new. Sent it back. I'm through with these. Nothing like the old-fashioned kind."
4,"Blood pressure machine with cool ""Comfit"" cuff.","My doctor recommended this brand. It's accurate, affordable, and easy to use. Be sure to get the model with the Comfit cuff. Recently, when hospitalized, all my nurses raved about it, wishing they had them on their BP machines."
4,it works,"would have given it a 5 star, were it not for the bulkiness. price is good and it is a no brainer to use. would recommend this product"
4,Very convenient,I've been using the ohmron automatic blood pressure monitor for a few weeks now at it works. For me it's much more convenient to use than those units that you have to manually pump. Good price.
5,Good BP monitor,Good blood pressure monitor I have seen. Big display and accurate reading. The only negative I felt is the size of the product. The ComFit cuff is comfortable.
3,Too many error messages.,"My only concern with this unit is the number of error messagesI get while trying to use it. The main error is in getting it tostart. After disconnecting and reconnecting a few times it willwork. I've tried following all of the instructions, but still getto many error messages to be able to rate it higher."
4,Easy to Use BP Cuff,"The Blood Pressure Cuff arrived quickly and well packaged. I was pleased with the storage bag for the unit making it easy to put away after each use. It was easy to put the cuff on, the instructions were easy to understand, and my doctor is pleased with the memory capabilities to record my history. I highly recommend this unit."
1,Not reliable,"It seldom EVER completes taking the blood pressure. The machine is constantly stopping after a few seconds no matter what I do with my arm to change it. It's frustrating, it's not reliable and it probably makes my BP go up each time I hit start.It's great all of you are getting such good results. I am not. It was a complete waste of money. It completes its cyle about 10% of the times I attempt to use it."
2,Didn't like the ComFit band,"I am returning this model for a different OMRON unit. I purchased this for my mother, but I'd use it as well as my dad. All three of us felt that the readings were not accurate. My husband tried it as well and thought the same. My bp is usually low-normal, but the readouts I would get with this one made me wonder how I was still standing! Also never got used to the arm band and the slightest movement seemed to make it error out. My mother is the one with the bp issue and I don't want to take a chance with a unit that reads too low."
5,Omron HEM-780N2 Auto Inflate Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,I'm very pleased with my new Omron Blood Pressure Monitor. The price was about 40% lower than in my local Walgreen's. Good value for a fine product!
2,Good machine with a bad cord.,"Having used Omron monitors for about twenty years and needing a new one after ten, I purchased the 780, and I think it would probably be a good monitor if the cord didn't twist up like a hose or a telephone cord and refuse to give a reading even sometimes when I'm holding it straight in my left hand, which is awkward. It does this even though I keep the monitor on a table and the cuff on a chair so that the cord is stretched out between uses. This is so inconvenient thatI'm thinking of returning it.Adelia"
1,"faulty monitor, HWM-780N2 blood pressure monitor",> I purchased the item aug 16. Today was my doctors appointment and the> doctor checked the Heart Monitor and stated that is not accurate and> giving incorrect reading.. I want to return this Item as it is faulty.
3,Arm Cuff,The arm cuff (?) supposedly fits all arms but this is NOT the case. I have had numerous times when it would not work due to the arm being too large.
1,Bogus,Bought this unit in December 2008 and have never gotten an accurate reading. It is always 15-20 pts higher on both systolic and diastolic. I was alarmed with the high reading and took it to my doctor's office for calibration. Her readings (6) confirmed the poor accuracy of this device. No more Omron products for me or anyone I know.
5,Everything I needed,"A great product! It's very easy to use and records all of my BP and pulse readings so I can give my doctor a history. The cuff is comfortable, and the reading process is smooth and quick; I've had no problems whatsoever. I lucked out and got an instant $10 off, so I paid $55 with free shipping and it was worth every penny. Highly recommended."
4,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor,"Actually, I bought this superb product for my grandfather who is a patient of hyper-tension. He is also using Inderal-10 to suppress high blood pressure, So it will be of great use for him to track his blood pressure, and even for other family members. The device is easy to use and full of productive features. In addition, the readings are very clear to observe. Moreover, I would like to recommend this device to all."
4,My Review,Easy to operate. Single mode operation gives the desired reading fast. Purchased at an affordable price. Easy to read.
5,Positive Outcome,"After using for many years the manual models of Blood Pressure Monitors, those sold for the general public were all of terrible quality, in a couple of years they wereinaccurate and difficult to use. I read about the new automatic machines and the easiness to use them, so I decided to buy one of the top Monitors recommended by Consumers Report. The Omron HEM-780 proved to be an easy thing to use, the information given is comprehensive & accurate.I would recommend it for personal use."
1,great features poor quality,"This is a really great machine with a large cuff and memory and time features which help keep track of your readings. However after only 3 months of use it has stopped working. We've replaced batteries and tried everything and it only inflates for a couple of seconds and then stops.So don't get caught up in all the bells and whistles and end up with a nonfunctioning unit, because they only count if they work."
1,Omron Hem-780,"When this thing works, I assume it is accurate. But, it very seldom works!! It stops working and indicates an ""E"". It is so frustrating.I really hate it and think I will just throw it out. I fought with it too long for returning it. But now what to buy?"
1,omron blood pressure kit,It does not fit my arm....my arm is under 9 inches....its worthless to me and I suppose its my fault but I didnt ask what size arm you needed. Didnt think I needed to....other kits I have bought have come with 2 arm sizes included. This one cost more then the others also.
2,Omron HEM 780 Auto Blood Press Monitor,The monitor keeps giving me error message. I had to turn it off and re-start again. Sometimes I had to re-start (stop/start) twice to avoid the error message.
1,Readings May Be Inaccurate,"The monitor is well constructed and user friendly. I got Serial No. 5Y31917LF which turned out to be inaccurate when measuring blood pressure. Readings are much lower than reality. Before you rely on this monitor, compare readings with an instrument known to be accurate. Since it failed at its intended job, I give it one star."
3,ok,"the readings are ok, i.e. they show if a person has low or high bp, but there is a lot of variation among the consequtive reading of same person at same time. i would not recommend if you are inversting more than 35 for it."
3,Works as Advertised,Accurate -- important and useful to me. Cross checked several times with the family Doctor. Glad I got it. Highly recommend.
1,disappointed Ñ_Ñ,"easy to use but after 3 weeks the measurements become very inaccurate. everytime my dad uses, it gives him totally off numbers like 90 or 100, which he has high blood pressure problem. he can't rely on this machine to check blood preasure daily. contacting omron is pain, long wait time(15mins) to connect to rep. and all they said ""did you follow the direction? try tomorrow and if it dose it again try couple more days then call back........"" after 5th calls i gave up and bought cvs brand one. new one works great....and after 9 months it broken down. i brought it back to cvs and no question asked they just exchange to new one.... CVS rock!"
1,don't waste your money,"Out of the box, this did not work. All I get are error messages. Its going back. Very disappointed ;("
3,Accuracy?,"This unit seems to function well, however, I am not sure how accurate the results are. Readings seem to run lower than actual blood pressure."
3,blood pressure machine,"Sometimes will give ""error"" and must take reading again. My wife has a lot of difficulty getting the cuff tight enough""we think this is the problem"" and many times will get the error message. She has better luck with a wrist cuff.Our Dr. prefers an arm cuff but we find the both get similar results."
4,Worth the money,Very good one. Bought for two months for everyday usage. Works like a charm. Better than my previous 20-dollars one. Would recommend to buy this.
1,Inaccurate/unreliable product,I recently bought this item but found it to be unreliable and consistently shows a rating of 10 to 12 points above the actual BP numbers. Not recommended.
2,displeased,At least it's consistent! It consistently runs 20 points below the BP reading my physician gets.
5,Omron Blood Pressure Monitor,The Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff was a very good investment. Took the unit to the Doctors office at my last appointment and had them check it out. The reading was very comparable to the doctors equipment. Very satisfied with the Omron HEM-780 and would recommend this unit.
4,blood pressure cuff,"This blood pressure moniter appears to be more accurate than my old one. I think the cuff is a bit to stiff and it is a bit more time consuming to use as it will not fit over long sleeved clothing. They recommend taking the pressure on bare skin, which is probably more accurate than through clothing."
1,Omron Blood Pressure Monitor,"I purchased this blood pressure monitor because I was told it was the best, but, it was wacked out. I even took it to some friends house (3 friends) who had monitors & it was way to high. I also took it to my doctors office and it was also way to high there.I was not to happy about this, so I sent it back & asked for a refund on my credit card, I got a gift card from Amazon (not what I wanted)."
2,What's the deal with these things...,"This item is very convenient to use compared to the ones where you have to pump and watch the Mercury. However, it does not take accurate readings. By comparison, this one will give a reading of 10 points lower on average. That's not good if you have high blood pressure and you need to have reliable equipment for survival. I'm going to exchange this one and give it another try. Maybe this one is just defective."
4,Omron HEM-780N3 Automatic blood Pressure Monitor,"This is one of the Best Item on the Market. Actually I was looking for some other brand I had earlier which I gave to some one. This one has two people memory A and B so you can keep track or your blood pressure. Also pulse, Date and Time.Very good Item for the price around $60.00"
1,Omron HEM-780 not very accurate,"I have the Omron HEM-780 unit for 1 1/2 years now and I find it to be inaccurate at times. The device has other problems with it like not giving me a reading at all, it just cuts out. This cut out problem has happened over 100 times. It inflates the cuff to a certain point, but then cuts off completely. I then have to remove the cuff and put it back on and redo the reading again.I personally do not care about the other features if it can not do the primary job and I find myself constantly using my backup manual cuff and stethoscope."
1,Grossly inacurate,"Unit was brand new and was grossly inacurate. Had to return it, but amazon does make it easy to return. Customer service suggested that it possibly was damaged during shipment. It was well pacakaged."
5,BP cuff review,This machine is easy to use and accurate. I like the memory system and multiple readings
5,great product - easy to use,It is easy to use and is very helpful determining blood pressure. I have been trying out various blood pressure medications and am easily able to determine which ones work. The ComFit cuff is very helpful.
1,DEAD OUT OF THE BOX!,"Ordered unit from Amazon because they had best price. Paid for 2 day shipping to get unit faster. Ordered on Jan. 13, came Jan. 15 started using Jan. 16 . Worked until Jan. 27. when unit kept giving error readings. Called Omron customer service , on phone over an hour , they could not figure why unit didn't work. Have to pay for return shipping and insurance. Am still without meter which my doctor says I need. Omron considered the best meter only when it works. Wanted better meter than I had and now have nothing. Thought Omron should send new meter after only 12 days rather then try to fix this one which I still don't have. I'm not happy, this is not a toy! Remember to always save the boxes things come in, easier to send back."
2,pressure reading,"I CANNOT GET THE CUFF TO SNUG UP PROPERLY. NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO PULL IT TIGHT IT SEEMS TOO LOOSE. THE RESULT IS PRESSURE READING VARIES EACH TIME WITHOUT CUFF ADJUSTMENT. ie I TRIED IT THREE TIMES IN A ROW AND GOT A READING OF 168/93, 154/91, 145/87 IN A MATTER OF JUST MINUTES."
3,Good blood pressure monitor,"It works well, but sometimes it gives inconsistent results even within a span of a couple of minutes."
2,Omron HEM-780/HEM-780N3 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,"I measured myself a few times, but always got numbers too low. Pretty disappointed."
2,Omron Hem 780,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit CuffI don't like the comFit cuff. Hard to put on and have to reset cuff couple times to get the monitor to work. Can't get a accurate reading.
5,OMRON HEM-780 N3 BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR,"THIS IS THE LATEST MODEL, SIGNIFIED BY THE N3 IN THE MODEL ID. IT HAS A NEW FEATURE THAT OMRON CALLS THE ""TRUE READ"" MODE. IT CAN AUTOMATICALLY TAKE 3 CONSECUTIVE READINGS, ONE EVERY 15, 30, 60 OR 120 SECONDS, AS SET THE THE USER, AND THEN GIVES THE AVERAGE OF THE 3 READINGS. MY DOCTOR AGREED THIS IS A MORE ACCURATE WAY TO DETERMINE BLOOD PRESSURE.I HAVE IT SET ON 60 SECONDS SO IN APPROX 3 MINUTES I HAVE MY BLOOD PRESSURE, AND PULSE RATE, BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF 3 SEPARATE READINGS.WHEN I PURCHASED IT ON AMAZON, THERE WAS A $[...] DISCOUNT CODE FROM OMRON, SO I PAID JUST $[...] WITH FREE SHIPPING. I'VE SEEN IT IN CHAIN DRUG STORES LIKE DUANE READE AND WALGREENS FOR ABOUT [...] BUCKS SO IT'S STILL A GOOD DEAL."
5,It's perfect,"Don't be misled by negative reviews. Believe it or not, there are always people who can't follow the simplest of instructions. This monitor is certainly very easy to use. Anyone who couldn't get something this simple to work must have put it on upside-down or put it on their head instead of their arm, or something bizarre like that. This monitor works perfectly, and is well-made."
1,Bad experience.,You need help to get a snug fit using this cuff. Do not dispose of the box and packing materials before trying this machine out for a few days. Makes it much easier to return. Liked my old Omron so much. Sad.
3,its ok,"well there are better ones than these, should provide more info. doesn't seem accurate. my parents hardly used it since we bought it"
2,only worked for less than a year,"I thought it was great at first, but it quit on me after about 7 months. I didn't use it all that often either. The cuff was easier to use than the standard ones while it lasted."
3,accuracy issues?,"I'm not quite sure how to rate this project just yet. I received it on time and in good condition. It is easy to use and has the features (easy to read screen and a/c adapter cord) that I wanted. But, it doesn't seem to be very accurate. I took it to my last doctor's appointment and checked the accuracy against the doc's BP monitor and the Omron was 10 points off on the systolic (top number). The diastolic number was right on though. This may be a result of my lack of experience positioning the cuff and my arm, but I think the Omron is a little off."
1,Not a comfort fit,"My arm is within the cuffs advertised measurements, and it still does not fit good. I keep getting error readings. I don`t know how accurate it is when I`am able to get a reading, because I get so upset over having to keep trying it. It just does not work well on my short arms."
3,Iffy,While the Omron is comfortable and easy to use I'm not so sure about it's accuracy. I test myself 3 times in a row every morning about 5 minutes apart. I always remove the cuff between measurments. The 1st test seems to read the highest (but not always). The machine seems to lack consistency. The averaged results of 5 weeks of testing seemed to indicate that my efforts to reduce my blood pressure were working however when I visited the doctors office my pressure was the same (high) as my previous visit 6 weeks earlier. Guess I'll continue to look for a better monitor.
4,Great Product/Features.......but,The BPM was delivered way on time. The Features were awesome....sooooo many I couldn't believe it!! Returned for a more user friendly one (which is???)CONS - Too complicated for an elderly person. Excessive features made it not so user friendly.System/carrying case the size of a portable DVD player making it kind of cumbersome for travel.
3,Omron 780,"I do not like the cuff. It doesn't always wrap around the arm tight enough. Would send it back for different type, but too much trouble. Everything else is fine"
1,Never got this item in the mail - never got a response when I informed the seller,"I ordered this item, paid for it and never received it. I sent an email, but never got a response. I'm sure it's a great product because I read the other reviews. Please either send the item or refund my money. Thank you!"
3,Okay for the price,I found this to be difficult to get the cuff secure on my arm which gave poor readings and at times no result. Could use a better cuff. The read out and recall feature are great but would be improved with a cuff that fit properly and was easier to put on and take off.
1,Did not last long,"Only lasted a few months. Then it started giving an Error after inflating for 17 seconds, and the inflation stops. Piece of junk. Would not recommend at all."
4,Good value for a good product,"Lots of features, I love the 200 reading memory and the 2 user files so I can keep one reading a day just for me, and the other for family members or friends.Only negative is the one size fits all arm cuff is hard to put on by myself."
4,good product!,"Basically, it performs satisfied. SinceI just use it for several times, I can't give too many details. But it worths the price."
1,After three days - only errors,"I am returning the product as it only worked for three days. After that, every time I tried to take a reading, I got the big ""E"". Also, it seemed to read extrememly high. My husband has normal blood pressure and when we tried it on him, it came back 178/121. Uh, no way! That surely doesn't help when I am trying to monitor mine to be sure it doesn't go too low or too high. The doc just started me on medication three weeks ago. I found that to get a three reading average, by the time I was able to get all three readings I was so frustrated, my pressure was going through the roof! Of course that could have to do with the artificially high readings it was returning anyway. lol It was very easy to use, but ease isn't going to be much good if it isn't accurate. I'm looking for another brand even if it costs me a little more."
5,perfect bp for you,"I liked it ,very easy to read and easy to use,sometimes an error appears informing you that the system needs to be check. e.g. loose cups that you need to put in place. I recomend this pruduct 100%."
2,Armcuff too dificult to use on both arms.,"The armcuff is too difficult to use for either arm, but much worse for the right arm. It takes 2 people to get the armcuff tight enough to get a reading. I would not buy another 780. I prefer my old 737 without the prefab cuff.Lou DeGruy III"
2,Harder to use than it should be,"I guess this monitor gives reliable readings, but I have found that at least half the time I apparently can't get the cuff closed sufficiently for it to register -- it gives an ""EE"" response and I have to start over. My husband has no trouble with it, so I guess it is at least partly my fault, but I had an older model from about 15 years ago that was a lot easier to use.Another flaw I find is that the traveling case is soft, so if you put pressure on it inadvertently, it does not keep the monitor from turning on. Memory features etc. are good. I have not yet had the chance to compare the monitor's readings with those from my doctor, but have no reason to believe they are inaccurate."
3,Omron HEM-780 Review,"The product is easy to set up and use, which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, it tends to be rather inconsistent and also was way off (higher than) the nicer one at my Dr's office when I brought it in to calibrate it. So, I tend not to trust it very much."
1,"Measures something, just not sure what","I think it's the cuff. It's junk. I have another Omron for home (older HEM-739) works great and has been validated by my Dr. for accuracy. The new HEM-780 is all over the place. It shifts wildly depending on how tight the cuff is, and the fun part is the cuff doesn't like to be adjusted. I will try to find another cuff but I wish I hadn't simply gone with the brand name when buying a second unit."
2,Omron HEM-780,"I purchased this product based on features and reviews. I don't know if I received a faulty unit, but it's worthless. I receive an error message eight times out of 10 times I try to use it. It doesn't matter where I put it or how tight the cuff. Whyen it does work, I try to get another reading immediately after, and get an error message. I've had a ReliOn for years which is very reliable...never any error messages. The only reason I switched was because of the features. Big mistake.I've had this two months but I'm sending it back."
1,Constant error message,"I had read very positive reviews about this product but found it to be very disappointing and frustrating. The monitor kept giving me an error message. To use the cuff, I had to actually hold the cuff down on my left arm with my right hand. I also took it to my doctor's office to see if I was not using it correctly. My doctor was getting the same error message. He advised me to return this unit which I did."
3,My unit constantly reads systolic 15 units too high..,"I took my HEM-780N2 to the doctors office after they questioned the readings that I was getting and we compared reading done by my docter and a nurse in the office... After several readings on both arms, the Omron averaged 15 units too high..."
1,BP Monitor not up to par,"After using this product for about a month and a half, I began to get very high blood pressure readings (157/106). My doctor took my BP on the same day and got 130/80, which I also got with my manual cuff. I find that this machine tends to show a rapid pulse as well.The only good thing about it is that you don't have to record your readings manually. If they calibrate the machine properly, it would be a great thing, but I wasted my money."
2,I guess I got a lemon,"I bought this particular monitor for the additional pulse monitor feature. It seemed to be accurate the first few times--just long enough to put some trust into it--then my ""pulse"" kept increasing and increasing. A manual pulse assessment on the wrist confirmed that I was okay; the monitor was not(an average of 20 points higher than my real pulse). I really liked all the features, including the AC adaptor and traveling kit, thus the 2 star rating, but inaccuracy in a medical device such as this is disconcerting."
3,Ill fitting cuff,"The machine itself works great. I love the fact that it stores your readings and for the most part, it's easy to use. However, the cuff is difficult for me to get tight enough to take a reading. By the time I do, I suspect my bp has gone up from having to fiddle w/ the stupid thing. The idea is good, but I'm dissatisfied w/ the engineering."
3,Not happy with the cuff,The monitor seems to work very well. I am not happy with the cuff. It is very difficult to get it tight to start. Several time I got an error message that the cuff is under inflated.
3,Omron HEM-780,"I received the Blood Pressure Monitor and found it to be very easy to use. I was a little worried about my blood pressure and took it with me to my annual physical (two week later). I was not surprised to find that the doctors office had a similar Omron Monitor. I was a little disappointed when we compared the Automatic Blood Pressure Monitors to three separate nurses taking my blood pressure the old fashion way. Both monitors indicated a higher BP. Approximately 7- 10 points higher. They said that while the monitors are good, they are not as accurate as they would like for the office and always take the BP's both ways to be sure."
5,Easy to use,I really like the Omron HEM-780. Good Features and easy to use!Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff
4,good bp monitor,easy to use works quietly only neg thing the cord from cuf to unit is a little short.
5,This is the kind my doctor recommended,"Last year, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. My family doctor wanted me to track my blood pressure over a period of time to see if my medication was what was necessary. I had tried to track my blood pressure using the mechanized machine at a local pharmacy, but the doctor said it might not be sufficiently accurate. The doctor recommended the kind of cuff that fits snugly over the upper arm. He said the kind of cuff that fits over the wrist was not sufficiently accurate.I have been pleased with the ability to both track my blood pressure on a daily basis, as well as the memory feature which records blood pressure on the monitor itself."
4,Great value,This is a great product that reallys works.Plus it is priced very well for all the features it has
2,Reliable while it lasted,"Unlike other commenters I found my unit to take accurate blood pressure readings. I was getting consistent numbers weekly, plus numbers that were very close to my doctor's numbers.Today my 2 year old unit began to malfunction, with lots of error readings regarding the cuff. This while trying to use the single reading feature. If I switch it to the 3 times feature, the machine might actually function one of the three times.This machine was too expensive for it to fail this quickly. I'd investigate another brand before I would purchase this one."
3,"Nice monitor, with inconsistancy","I bought this as a gift for my mother who has hypertension since giving birth to me. I tested it myself first. The instruction is clear for easy setup. It is also convenient in battery mode which keeps record of your measurement. The only concern is that the reading is inconsistent. I accept variation between morning reading and night reading. But the variation is a bittle huge (>10mmHg) even within 10 mins. Otherwise this monitor is pretty nice a functional unit that provides convenience to the people like my mother.Other thoughts: this one came with a 10$ manufactory MIR. But I did not get it from Omron even I sent the bar code and receipts. Omron said I didn't send the UPC, so no way I can check for that. Based on this I removed 1 star in rating for unsatisfactory service.I would recommend this unit to people who are huntering for an economical and convenient blood pressure monitor."
5,"Yes, It's an N3","I just received mine so it's too early for me to review it. But responding to an earlier post, the box has 780 as the model number but the machine has a sticker on the back that has N3."
2,Very Disappointed,"They should have a quick guide, two-page booklet summarizing how to set the unit. I had to read the brochure twice before being able to use it. At first I was using the single test mode and for some reason it reset by itself to the Tru-Test mode which takes 3 readings within 3 minutes span and gives you an average. I had to go back to the booklet to reset it to the single test mode. I used to have a manual inflate bp monitor and I never had trouble with it. This one gives too many error messages related to the cuff. I don't like the fact the cuff doesn't lie flat. Next time I buy something from Amazon, I am going to read the one and two star reviews instead of the 4 and 5 star ones."
5,Easy to use; pretty accurate; quality product.,I have used this BP monitor for a while and feel it was a good purchase. I did a lot of review reading before choosing one as I was worried about it being grossly inaccurate. I just had a follow-up doctor's visit and he checked it against his steth readings....accurate to within 1-2 points on three separate readings. Thats good enough for me! Be careful when choosing models as some of them have smaller cuffs which may not fit your arm properly.
5,Easy to use,Very easy to use and accurate. We checked with my husbands MD's BP cuff and was totally accurate. We love it.
4,104/68,"The blood pressure monitor is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate. The cuff is easy to place, and will accommodate a fairly big arm."
4,"Simple, quick.","I had the opportunity to use a friend's Omron HEM-780 and was impressed. I bought one for myself and remain impressed. The lone (possible) drawback is the variability of results. I will often take 5 consecutive readings varying the position of the cuff on my arm, and I get 15% variability. Don't know if that's typical of any blood pressure measurement device, or just an artifact of the cuff used on this machine. Bottom line: I like it and recommend it."
5,Great product......Great price.,"My husband and I have been very happy with our Omron HEM-780 automatic blood pressure monitor. It is soooo quick and easy to use. One feature we really like is that it has an adapter you plug in, so you don't have to wonder if you are getting an accurate reading because of the posibilty of batteries getting weak. It isn't bulky so we can leave it out, as he uses it 3 times a day. We would highly recommend this product. It sure beats the old one that we had to use with a stethoscope."
4,Nice item to have,"If you need a simple to use home blood pressure monitor this is the one to get. I've been very pleased with this item, but there is one word of warning. All blood pressure monitors are sensitive to cuff size and if you need a larger cuff or you get the cuff too tight you may get an inaccurately high reading."
5,WOW! The Best BP Monitor on the market!,"I spend a great deal of time researching BP Monitors prior to purchasing this Omron HEM-780. I have large arms and the Comfit Cuff worked very well for me. My wife is a little Lady. The Comfit Cuff worked well for her also. I chose the HEM-780 for the features, customer feedback from Amazon purchasers, and feedback from other web sites. This is a quality item and perfect for my household. Take charge of your health with this reliable, and accurate BP monitor. You will not be sorry."
5,Puts your mind at ease................,"The Omron HEM-780 BP Monitor is the best thing since sliced bread! My husband has high BP and needs to watch it very closely.....This monitor is so simple and easy for him to use -- and he uses it daily. Keeping records and looking back, he can track his progress to lower his bp.... I have already recommended this tool to others watching their high bp. Value for the money is HIGH! Very useful tool in anyone's health care. Highly recommend."
5,Excellent Product,This is a great Blood Pressure monitor. Readings perfectly matched with my doctor's blood pressure monitor. Highly recommend this product.
3,"Overly sensitive to cell phones, etc.",Per the manuel - BP readings are distorted when cell phones are near by; probably should be aware of Wifi routers and other devices which transmit a signal too. This can be frustrating when trying to locate a stationary location for the BP monitor.
1,Much too difficult for the non-professional user,"Three people have attempted to get this unit to work correctly. Each of us have been over and over the instruction manual. The unit simply does not work. First the reading is very high, then very low... .then an error message. When I called the company, their customer service advised me to have the user call for more detailed instruction on how to use the cuff, so if you don't mind seeking detailed tutorials with the company, you might not be as aggravated as I am. I definitely would not call this unit easy to use. I would have expected to be able to use it with reference to the instruction manual, not with advanced telephone tutorials. Three of us have attempted to use it without success. My impression is that it is very sensitive and requires a high degree of skill and instruction to use correctly, if you can get it to work at all. That is not what we were looking for in a home unit."
3,Sometimes It Works,"The cuff has to be set just exactly right or I get an error. So now, I hold the thing down against my arm when it first starts to inflate so it will keep going. Of course, I have no idea whether there is any accuracy in the readings I get, but this is the second unsatisfactory monitor I have tried and I'm not ready to go another round. Next time, I'll go to the pharmacy that carries the equipment and try out the monitors before I buy - some things are not successfully purchased sight-unseen."
1,It is a bad product,"I bought the HEM-780 for my personal use. However, its quality is poor. When the blood pressure is normal, it is accurate; When the blood pressure is not normal, it is inaccurate. My wife often measured my blood pressure for me becasue she is a nurse and I also have a panasonic EW 3152A blood pressure monitor. I often compared the measurements at the same time and found that the panasonic is best one; However,Omron HEM-780 is bad. I called Omron Company serveral times and they said that my Comfit cuff is old, But it is not true.Blood pressure monitor is a important tool to pretect you and you need to choose a right one."
2,JUST OK,"DOES NOT FIT IF ARM IS VERY BIG. CAN NOT USE ON LARGE ARMED PERSON,WILL NOT GIVE TRUE READING"
3,blood pressure monitor,"The Omron monitor is easy to put together but I found it difficult to follow the directions as they are not clear. Too complicated! It took a long time but I think I have figured it out. Because it it so complicated, I don't use the monitor every day as I should. Someone should redo the booklet."
5,BP Monitor,"Simple to use, results display immediately on screen. My physician uses this model is his office."
2,I have seen worse,Let me start by saying the Samuel Jackson is one of my favorite actors and he is about the only bright spot in this movie. The picture and sound are very good but this movie is so unbelievable that it takes away from the acting. I love action movies but I also like them to be somewhat realistic and this one isn't.This could have been a good movie...
1,Should get an oscar for best screenplay,"What an interesting film. Imagine, the CIA as villain! Sorry. Didn't mean to give the plot away."
5,Where's the sequel?,"After watching dozens of action movies with completely interchangeable leads, it is refreshing to see one that actually attempts to mix things up a bit. Though as unblievable as any other action flick (come on, name one high-budget movie that convinces you the main character could actually do this stuff), this movie comes through with fun action and great humor between Davis and Jackson. If Die Hard or Mission Impossible are your thing you should at least check this one out."
5,Great action flick,"One of my favorites in a long line of amnesiac secret agents/assassins (Bourne identity, Jackie Chan's Who Am I?...) Geena Davis pulls off this slick and tough persona and makes it work! Samuel Jackson, of course, is fabulous. The reason why I enjoy these ""amnesia"" movies so much is because they are symbolic of our own amnesia regarding our true nature. Wonderful spiritual movies, after all!"
4,Action-Packed Movie with a Decent Plot,"Okay, so the plot has been done before - CIA operative with amnesia suddenly discovers (in this case) she has some abilities that she didn't know she had and struggles with making her disturbing past work with her present identity. Then, throw in the private eye (Samuel L. Jackson) to pair up with Geena Davis as they bounce one-liners off one another while the action takes place. Sure, it's been done before, but this one is expertly done. The plot is simple enough to follow, but intriguing enough to keep you interested. The one-liners should keep you chuckling and the mixture of Geena Davis as CIA operative/school teacher works in this movie. If you like action, drama and a bit of humor, this one isn't a waste of your time."
5,"love this movie, had to make it part of our collection.","we just love this movie, single mom turns terminator with lots of humor, we look forward to watching it every christmas season, but this year it wasn't on so we finally added it to our DVD collection."
4,Finally out in blu-ray,"Been waiting for blu-ray for over a year. Saved a few bucks on the used ""new"" option. In fact, I've bought several this way through Amazon and this enables me to buy more without feeling guilty."
4,Long Kiss Goodnight,"Like the fellow from Egypt...I just heard about this film....and it is now Nov 2002...the part to which he refers is the scene in which Samuel Jackson is told that ""it would be hard to fake the death of 4000"" and so they will have to die in order for the US to get funding for the military...and the last line....""To blame it on the Muslims""....I found this 1996 film astounding and horrifying..What is even worse I suppose is now believing that the govt is capable/willing to do anything on behalf of their goals...namely seizing oil....anything is now possible....shameful...."
3,"Great movie, horrible quality DVD","I love this movie, it's one of my all time favorites but would NOT recommend buying from here. The quality is horrible, the sound is in and out, altogether a sub-par quality DVD. You will regret buying it."
4,The Long Kiss Goodnight,I love this movie. A lot of action and Geena Davis is great as an action star.
1,One of the dumbest movies i've ever seen,"First off Gina Davis is not an actress,she's eye candy and thats about it.Much like Kelly La Brock from back in the 80's.Also why in the world would you cast a great Actor like Samuel L Jackson in such a lame blow up,beat em up make no sense action picture,he's way to genuine for such a goofy flick.Gina is super spy woman who hits a deer with a car,gets mad then breaks its neck,single handedly takes down loads of villians with machine guns,and also breaks THERE necks as well.Cheese Cheese Cheese.And although a lot of the action scenes were well executed it doesnt save this from being a major flop that you'll find for 5.99 in your DVD discount bin at Wal-Mart:)"
1,It's bad on so many levels,"Do not buy this movie. If it's on Showtime, change the channel. You will do yourself a favor. You will save brain cells too. I don't want to waste your time repeating the above paragraph over and over just because I have the space. Choose a noose over this movie, it's over faster and you'll feel the same afterwards."
4,The Long Kiss Goodnight,"I Have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and not only avoid Triggers, But happy endings are good therepy. On a scale of one to ten I rate this a strong nine."
4,What happened to Jules in Pulp Fiction?,"This film is simply fun action that does not require thinking about reality; i.e. the characters can out run explosions. It has some really great one-liners that made the movie for me. Samuel Jackson, with most of the one-liners, saves the day. Samuel Jackson plays a shady detective/con-artist. He plays the part just like his character in ""Pulp Fiction"", Jules. In fact you can imagine this is what happens to Jules after he retires as a hit man. Some of Jackson's lines seem just like what Jules in ""Pulp Fiction"" would say. Geena Davis is mostly a prop in this movie, but does play well, at times, as person tortured by a dual personality. This movie is much like Lethal Weapon 1 and 2, which is not surprising as they all have the same writer. A DVD with not a lot of extras that a keep in my collection when I feel like watching some fun brainless action."
4,"Geena Davis & Samuel Jackson,....,PERFECT","I,m not a critic, or do I over analyze a movie. If there good there good,This one is exceptionally good. It has it all,action,pace and surprise. For my money its a perfect action flick,Geena Davis $ Samual Jackson,.....,PERFECT"
5,It's my favorite!,"I never get tired of re-watching this movie - it has so much to offer! Both Geena Davis and Samuel L Jackson give rich, multi-textured performances in this story of an amnesiac who discovers that she used to be an killer for the government! And that they are after her! If you like ""la Femme Nikita"", you'll love ""Long Kiss Goodnight""!"
4,Chilling WTC reference,"I had purchased this DVD a while back, but hadn't watched it until recently. The chilling part is the references to the conspiracy that the CIA & FBI were behind the WTC basement bomb in the 90's to generate more funding for their respective organizations."
3,Some of the cheesiest lines in movie history,"With the plot an obvious stretch of the imagination they did the only thing they could wih this movie, give it really cheesy lines. Has some great action scenes no doubt about it but the dialogue made it for me.Geena Davis certainly did well, but Samuel L Jackson saves the day again."
4,A non-stop thriller with a great sense of humor.,"I don't care what the critics (including Leonard) say, we really enjoyed this film. It is spunky, witty, funny and both Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson are fantastic. I give it four stars only because of the annoying and, in some ways, unnecessary child. Maybe if they made her less whiny and just as spunky as Davis I would give it five stars. Everyone I've told about this movie likes it at least as much as I do."
5,Awesome. Extra spicy. SO MUCH BETTER THAN LEONARD MALTIN!!!!,"The best movie ever made. Very very funny funny movie. Sammy Jackson is as good as a goose in time for a morning snack in the summer, with a little bit of salt and peppa added to make it SUPER COOL. There is a certain critic out there who is a stinker, leonard maltin. BOOOOOOOO! to him. He said this was a bad movie, and he is about as wrong as eating a pretzel with Susan B Anthony in the middle of August when it's raining. Very good movie and funny+ good= better than Leonard Maltin."
5,Great action!! Strong female role!!! Terrific acting!!,"The first time I saw this movie, I knew it was going to be added to my favorites collection! This is a movie you'll love watching over and over again, therefore it's a perfect fit for DVD. I thouroughly enjoyed the character of Geena Davis as she's a woman who can take care of herself. But that isn't the focus of the movie. It's just refreshing to see for once. I love the role that S. L. Jackson plays! Love the one liners!! If you like non stop action, you'll love this one! The music track is a plus also! A great mix that keeps up the pace of the story!!"
4,A keeper in my collection,"Like the other reviewer said, ""Give it a rest."" The combination of Geena Davis & Samuel L. Jackson is great, the supporting cast is so darn competent and good that it makes the whole movie even easier to watch, the special effects and stunts are top-drawer, and just because the ""hero"" is a girl who is tough as they come is no reason not to give this movie high marks. I think it was under-rated when it came out (Cutthroat Island really wasn't very good), but this one is a different matter. Put it in with the Lethal Weapons and the Die Hards and enjoy it."
4,Ahead of its time,"When this movie came out in 1996, it was mostly ignored by the public. The problem was that it just happened to be several years ahead of its time. Before ""Lara Croft"", ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Kill Bill"", Geena Davis played one-woman-army Charlie Baltimore. She was really the first major actress to play this kind of role - a female superhero - and she did a damn fine job. Davis, who usually plays kooky or offbeat characters, is convincing and compelling at playing a woman trying to reconcile her past as a ruthless assassin with her present as a mother and schoolteacher. This movie is a fun, thrilling action film that also happens to star Oscar-calibar actors. I'd recommend checking it out and seeing what everybody missed out on 7 years ago."
4,Geena Davis looks great,"I think this is a great movie, very entertaining. I think Geena Davis is a talented actor, I admire a woman, who does at least some of the stunts herself. I just loved the part where she changes her looks, from a house wife, with long brown curly hair, to a sexy spy, with short blond hair. There is lots of great action sceenes, I don't think Samantha Caine would survive any of it in real life, but that's not the point in a movie is it? She jumps out of a building, survives car crashes, explosions and lots of other stuff. If you like this movie, I also recomend: ""Face/Off"" ""Con Air"" ""The Rock"" and ""Bad Boys"""
4,A Holiday Classic? You bet!,"Well, kind of. In my twisted household anyway. This is one non-stop, action-packed thriller from beginning to end. Completely over-the-top - some of the torture scenes make you think of the real oldies with Little Nell and the railroad track, but boy is it fun. Davis is truly cool here: funny and wide-eyed one minute, sleek and vicious the next. Jackson is great as her somewhat unwilling cohort and the two have a great chemistry. Bierko is SO evil he should have a mustache to twist. Fun, very fun. All played out against a Christmas backdrop mind you. A good triple feature with Die Hard and The Bells of St. Mary's. (LOL) A must have for action freaks! WAY TOO MUCH FUN!!!!!!"
3,A good read with reservations,"It is a high compliment to Keith Douglass that I went enjoyed Carrier 10 despite a number of what I saw as unrealistic scenarios. For example, with what knowledge I have of the permissible action links for nuclear release, I have a real problem believing a senator and a couple of admirals could manage to launch a nuclear weapon at Cuba (using a remote piloted vehicle, no less) and more importantly that they could believe that they would get away with it.Douglass is at his best when describing individual flying. He's less so when dealing with strategic issues or land warfare (The ad hoc exfiltration plans of the SEAL team when they knew they'd be burdened with a civilian were downright embarrassing)Still, he is a yarn teller of the first order. It isn't easy to keep up the suspension of disbelief in the face of even minor errors, but he manages. If he would either broaden his research or narrow his scope, Douglass would be great."
4,"Very Good, But not Clancy","Book was better than previous books by Douglass that I have read. Being a life member of the United States Naval Institute I have some knowledge of the proposed ""Arsenal Ship"" that the author used. He also used a plot ploy of ""Micro-management"" & ""target selection"" from the White House, which being a ARMY Special Forces Veteran from the Viet Nam War I am very familiar with (Johnson & then Nixon chose individual targets & ""managed"" the war themselves. All and all, a great entertaining adventure, but different from Clancy, which it is inevitably compared with. Definitly worth the price of ""admission"""
5,"FORTY YEAR OLDS, THIS BOOK IS A MUST","Those of us who are forty or so should read this wonderful accounting of a man who discovers one of his sexual encounters as a teen resulted in a wonderful daughter whom he just meets. This along with a storyline that is humorous which sometimes brings me to deep ponderings about my own situation in relationships, makes this book a quick read and a wonderful one. pick it up now or wait til summer, you'll enjoy this book a lot."
4,Quality handbag,"This is a very nice purse only downfalls is that the drawstring doesn't stay tight when you pull it to close the purse which is underneath the snap and also my snap came apart, but I still like the quality and style of the purse."
3,Slightly tall,"I bought this purse some couple of weeks back, only things which was not to my expectations is it is made of hard leather so It always stands straight) which also makes it looks tall. I found it slightly tall in height than normal backpack purse, but in all its a good purse.Have one common pocket & one in front & there is a mobile holder pocket. I found it to be an average purse may be I was expecting more for the money I paid."
5,The Girls Who Went Away is Excellent!,"This book is a must read for anyone that has been touched by adoption! It will help women who have surrendered to realize that they aren't alone, adoptees will gain understanding of what their birthmother's went through. Children and spouses of birthmother's and even parents should read this book to gain insight to their loved one!"
5,A True and Honest Portral of Birthmothers,"I ordered this book before it was in print and I am glad I did. Since I am a birthmother, I was reassured that there were other women who went through what I went through, 40 years ago. It brought alot of tears that were held for 40 years, knowing others had the same pain that I had. The book can bring back forgotten memories and tears to birthmothers. Every birthmother from those decades should read this book and understand we were not alone and that the present birthmothers should not go through that pain. I recomend this book to anyone interested in the rights of women."
5,A must read!,"This book opened up so much for me. It really showcases what being pregnant and young/unwed meant in my mothers generation. In my generation I saw pregnant girls by the dozen walk through the halls of my high school, thinking why would they keep there babies they are 16 and 17 years old. I recongize now just how huge it is that are allowed to stay in school. Now I am so thankful that sex was talked about in my health class, and while contraception wasn't a big point in the syllabus, it was there. I think this book showcases just what we can improve on as a society.This book is really a must read for all poeple."
5,A Girl who came back,"Being one of ""The Girls Who Went Away"", I really did not know what to expect when I started reading this book. I certainly did not expect to get such shocking and enlightening look at the sociopolitical atmosphere that was in place when I was experiencing one of the most heartbreaking times of my life. The book brought back many painful memories and called forth an anger I had not been able to get in touch with before. Thankfully, the book also provided me with information tools I needed to process that anger and come to a clearer understanding of the damage done to my psyche through the forced surrender of my child. Ann Fessler gave me a window through which I could see, with adult eyes, the world and events I could not understand with my then ""child"" mind. I am ever grateful to Ms. Fessler for having the courage, tenacity, compassion and vision to write this book which helped bring, at least this girl, out of the shadows and home again to her own heart."
3,The girls who went away,"Ann Fessler is an accomplished author in the area of adoption, abandonment, and recovery from the destructive forces of court systems who hide their secrets. She approaches the ignorance in sexuality that exists worldwide. She also addresses the gender differences and what they do to women. She is enlightening every step of the way in her journey. Amazon accomplishes its intent in marketing excellent literary subjects like this."
3,Question...,QUESTION: This book only talks about what happened to unwed mothers after World War II. What happened to unwed mothers BEFORE World War II?
4,adoption issues,"Good resource for ""girls who went away"" or know someone who did or someone who is doing a report or paper on the subject of adoptions"
4,Recommended,I have been wanting to read this book for some time. I will recommend it for many reasons. It is well written and I must encourage you to read the entire book as the author does a good job of wrapping up the book after all of the interviews and history. What a compelling piece of women's lifes. Although the title includes that this is pre Roe v. Wade please don't think that abortion is the issue here. I think the author included that in the title to shape the time period as abortion was not a choice.I will be thinking about these women as they are portrayed so realistically to me.
5,A Must Read,"This book is a must read, for all touched by adoption; adoptees, adoptive parents, firstparents, and all extended family members. This should be a REQUIRED read for all expectant mothers considering adoption. Even more important, this is a must read to understand the history of domestic adoption which falls in line with the history of our country.Read it."
2,Dry reading boring but informative,"I had to get this book for one of my classes and I didn't really care for this. It's very dry reading although I can not deny the fact that it is very interesting regarding adoption. No one know what goes on in the adoption world, it follows adoption though out the years where it was very taboo. I thought that the chapters read like a textbook running off statistics, and stories but no real substance. I wouldn't read this book again for recreational purposes."
1,A MUST READ!,"I heard about this book on NPR and it stuck such a cord with me as I had given a daughter up for adoption in 1966. The stories of these women are my story, with slight variations. After 40 years I have a sense of closure that I never had. For anyone who was adopted, or gave a child up for adoption, or who knew someone who ""went away"" this book will help understand what the climate towards unmarried mothers was like. Society today is SO different. But there are thousands of us out here and this book tells our story"
2,Something is missing.,"I would be interested in knowing if any other reviewers felt like this book was missing something--not giving the full picture. It just left me kind of empty. Very critical and unsympathetic of the young fathers, basically classifying them all as deadbeats, yet very empathetic and non-judgmental towards the unwed mothers. I know I am in for criticism, but sorry, but I was hoping for a much more unbiased, objective book."
2,Overstated and inaccurate,"An interesting but limited account of mother's from a small geographic region. Assusmes a revisionist/deconstructionalist version of history. The tales range from sad to tragic, but never takes on the issue of individuals personal responsibility and accountability for actions and hence the whine, woe, victim status. Complete with the common anti-male slant. As an adoptee reunited with my mother, we both agree, this is the trite Hollywood version trumped for a Lifetime Channel audience that paints these mothers as helpless controlled victims forced to be dimwitted- not on this side of the Mississippi. My birth mother made a tough choice for her own interests, own's up to that choice and like actual women from the era would have kicked the teeth in of anyone who challenged that decision."
5,Excellent-as an adoptee it was very helpful,"As an adoptee, of a mother with a very similar story to the women in Ann's book, my eyes were opened. It has always been hard for me to truly understand what unmarried women went through back in the 60's. Growing up (I am 38 now) girls were still scorned for getting pregnant while in HS or if they were unmarried, but I was shocked by the treatment of the women in this book. And the sad thing is, this treatment was widespread and there are similar threads that weave through all these mothers stories. I thank Ann for helping me to understand the pain and struggle of these women. This book is a must read!"
4,Great idea-but could have been better,"The story idea was very good and much of the story flows well. Sarah Chalke, and most of the rest of the cast did well. Cavanaugh, who is normally a very good actor, tried hard but simply had no clue as to what his character is all about. And that is a shame, but understandable as the scientific/computer nerd type is a very interesting and even fascinating kind of man - but very little understood by most of the people who write screen plays (the exception that proves the rule is the writers behind the successful TV comedy ""The Big Bang Theory""- who very readily admit that they too would be lost were it not for having had an actual past association with this personality type). It is this lack of understanding that leads to the defects that other reviwers have reacted to. That being said, I do own a copy and found it entertaining even with its flaws."
1,Can't Make 'em any Worse than This,Very very very very bad.I can only imagine the actors/actresses/crew involved in this uninspired bit of trash must have each thrown up between takes.It's honestly that bad.
1,Skip it,"Not worth the money. Not really a book for scrapbooking. Just, skip it and buy something else with your money."
5,YES!!!!,"When you hear this wonderful recording, so fully, sensitively and emotively played, you'll hear how much Schumann in this piece influenced Rachmaninoff decades later. I love this recording, and highly recommend it to lovers of artists who show love in their playing. A great teaming of soloist and conductor, which is essential."
2,Amusing but ultimately pointless,"This is a funny book. To deny that would be less than intelligent to put it mildly. However, its humor can't save it from being ultimately pointless and something of a time-waster.When you begin it, it seems very funny and accessible. The jokes about Vinnie and Gepetto, the constant usage of the phrase ""passing lesbian"" and the cat jokes are all funny. Truthfully, they never cease to be amusing, as do not the Jewish jokes. This book is amusing.However, what little plot there is soon becomes tiresome. You don't care. And you can't care. Funny as it is, it's really a waste of time."
3,Gamier when ressurected?,"The Kinkster is indeed back. Reading about Kinky and the village irregulars is like hanging out with a bunch of old familiar mates, ( I'm English so I address everyone as 'Mate' just like Mick Brennan). The trouble is that these mates, after ten or eleven visits, are getting a little bit too familiar and their characters revealed as just a little sketchy and one-dimensional. My suggestion to Kinky would be to make Ratso the central character of the next adventure or somehow mix up the format a little bit. Otherwise things may go totaly Thatcher, (English for Nixon)."
3,Let down; not as good,"Again Friedman writes in a strange and unique voice. Again, as with Parker's Spenser, the plot is subordinate to the characters' interactions and, more importantly here, the voice of the narrator. The plot is slight: Kinky decides to harass the lesbian dance instructor upstairs and, simultaneously, tries to find out about a woman whose life he once saved ~ and wouldn't you know it, she's right upstairs. Curiously, i found this less satisfying than the previous Friedman i've read. I began to find the characters blurring before mine eyes until, at one point, i couldn't tell McGovern from Brennan ~ and discovered i didn't really care. Not a disaster; not even a waste of time; but i no longer have that wonderful feeling that i *will* read the next Friedman i come across."
4,"hey, kinky, can i hang out and smoke a ceegar with ya?","i laughed, i hooted, i drank some brandy, and i smoked cigars. kinkstah is back and damn!, is this book great. i liked so much more than BLAST FROM THE PAST this has soul to it, and its a hell of a good read! so kinkstah if yer out there, keep em comin, i'll keep reading them, and maybe someday we can smoke a ceegar, you, me, the cat, and the negro puppet head.in case your wondering, yeah i dug the book!"
5,Going that extra mile,"A fantastic story of a mother's struggle to understand and meet the needs of her autistic son. I wish there was another follow-up book as I would love to know how Sam is doing now. Bronwyn Hocking seems to have realised that the relative influences of nurture/nature in her son's condition are finally irrelevant. What matters is that she has now done everything in her power to get Sam's needs met, whether or not it goes against current orthodoxy. Her personal journey is inspiring, Sam's even more so."
1,very basic and overpriced,"This map is very basic. It has a large blow up of Jamaica, which is not one of Southern islands(and not even on the big map) while omitting Trinidad, Tobago, Aruba and Curacao. . Almost no detail of the islands."
4,A fine continuation. . .,". . .of an outstanding series.In ""Advise and Consent"", Allen Drury brought us into the inner workings of the US Senate. In ""A Shade of Difference"" he brought us into the inner workings of the United Nations. He continued his excellent ""Advise and Consent"" series with a book that touched upon the overwhelming power of the media to form and force public opinion, and did so in a context (that of a violently divided Presidential nominating convention) which resonates true today.When Mr. Drury was writing, his main fear was the communist threat. His books need to be read and understood in that context. However, don't think for a moment that his books are not timely today. Take a look at the political and journalistic situation surrounding the 2000 Presidential election, and one can easily see how insightful Mr. Drury was. (20 years in the newspaper business did him some good!)I'm sorry that we have lost Mr. Drury -- I would have enjoyed his take on recent events in the US."
3,Entertainingly Disappointing,"A good premise that fails to deliver on its ideas. Lots of lovely details and fun moments unfortunately add up to a less than a satisfying whole.There is a too-conscious effort to be hip here, and maybe I'm too old, but somehow the whole thing felt as if it were put together by a couple of smart, if smarmy, high school kids. Clever, sharp, witty, but missing the big picture, not offering me more than what was on the surface. And while the surface was entertaining, it was not entertaining enough. I want more, especially when a film is offering some notions about creating and altering reality, and it just did not deliver. What does it mean that these two characters cannot create but only destroy? That they can only subtract from the world? Well, that is a provocative thought, but it goes nowhere here.So, while it was amusing, it was not much more. Aim high and you are held to a higher standard."
1,Nothing is worse,"This movie was terrible. It couldve been something, but went nowhere. It seems like a children's made for PBS movie. I love all kinds of weird B movies and quirky indie flicks, but this was absolute trash. The characters are completely unlikeable and excruciatingly painful to watch. If you like to watch two guys bouncing around a white background for an hour and a half whilst crying about it, then rent it. The scenery probably resembles your mind."
1,Whatever.,"It wasn't even funny. Just a pure waste of film. An idiotic movie which left me feeling like a complete fool.When they call it Nothing, it's really about nothing.Folks please don't waste your money. You don't even get an hour's worth here. This movie will do nothing but insult your intelligence.Yikes, and I thought that that Anne Hathaway movie 'Havoc' was bad... This one definitely takes the cake."
1,TERRIBLE! I would give this 0 stars if I could,"The movie starts off with a semi-interesting twist. The two main characters, Andrew and Dave, encounter some slight troubles with the law. Andrew gets accused of kissing a pre-teen girl scout and Dave's ex-girlfriend steals over $27,000 from his workplace. The angry parent of the girlscout shows up to their house, as well as the police. Then NOTHING comes and 'NOTHING' hits the wall.Aside from Andrew being annoying as possible throughout the entire movie, the film has taken many good ideas and done absolutely NOTHING with them. You find yourself waiting for something to happen, which is the only reason I continued to watch the movie. Everything they hate disappears and soon they begin to hate eachother, which you see coming the entire time. Poor acting and a weak plot destroy what could have been a good movie."
1,Nothing worth seeing here,"Typically,I like these odd movies,but this one was horrible.Its about two losers who cant function well in society,and end up getting their wish to live in a world where none of the things that bother them exist.I thought that this is where the comedy would begin.However,I cant even remember laughing even once.Rather than this being a ""be careful what you wish for,"" Twilight zone type movie,the two losers actually seem to enjoy living in a world with nothing and settling disputes by challenging each other in their favorite videogame!Theres no moment where these two suddenly realize that,yes,people and all the aggravating nonsense in life may get to you,but it is considerably better than the alternative,and that maybe ,in some strange way,we do live in the best of all possible worlds.The ending is totally ridiculous and stupid as well.I rarely ever watch a film and regret even renting it.This one ISN""T better than nothing."
5,"Oh, you crazy Canadians","Yeah for Nothing! Two friends with more than the common amount of neurosis hate the outside world away. They're left with half a house, Stan the turtle, each other, and, of course, Nothing. The strange visual texture of the city of Toronto provides a great contrast for the expansive Nothing that dominates the screen for most of the movie. The animation sequences during the opening/closing credits are fun; the acting is fantastic and the script is funny as all get out. It makes you wonder how the director of a D Horror movie like Cube could produce an engaging romp like Nothing. Chalk it up to personal growth, I guess.I highly, highly, highly recommend this move. Sadly, not everyone is cool enough to enjoy it. And to those people I say, Sucks to be you."
3,could have been much better,"The idea of a movie about nothingness is original and the first half of the movie is promissing. To the end however it gets too childish for what it seemed to be a more like ""The cube"" type of a movie. The acting is good and there is a plot that makes sense spiced by a nice slightly dark humor . It's just that I expected a more deep and controversial meaning of the story.The movie still provides for those of you who want something different than the well known Hollywood consumer garbage."
2,not sure what i just seen,"well the title speaks for its self. this film is cheaply made and it is not all that funny but,the weirdness of the film kept me watching. this film pretty much bombs but ill give it 2 stars for the begining,when everything made sence"
5,"Not for those spoiled by ""Poltergeist"" and Stephen King","It is clear that some folks who have read this book and have been disappointed by it came of age in the current era of slasher movies and hide-nothing horror. The subtle terror of Jackson's book will escape those of you who grow impatient quickly and want to see the blood and guts right away. However, if you savor slow-mounting suspense and subtle, psychological horror, you will love this one -- as I did."
4,Great novel dealing with psycological meanings and symbolism,This was a well written horror novel. In the Haunting of Hill House the old mansion has many symbolic meanings. It serves as Eleanor's lover and rescuer at the end of the tale. Jackson is the master of suspence and this book will definately send chills down your spine.
5,It's incredible!,"The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson is an incredibly written story. I watched the movie after reading the book--- the movie is NOTHING compared to the well-worded, suspenseful novel. This is a spellbinding read for anyone who dares to try it... but you might want to sleep with the light on... I know I did. I kept imagining statues coming to life or hands coming out of the walls to grab me. It's terrifying!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring",Our book club at work just completed reading this book and for the life of us no one could figure out what all the fuss was about. Nobody found this book remotely scary and the only mysterious things about it was trying to figure out what personality would be inhabiting the main characters from page to page. The only thing that kept one member reading was the hope that the simmering lesbian relationship between Eleanor and Theodora would blossom.
2,This book is stupid.,"One of the few case's when the book is a great deal worse than the movie. It lacks action and genuine scare tactics, and isn't worth the time it takes to read it."
4,A Good Read,"This book wasn't as creepy as I wanted it to be, but the psychological thrill was great.It's not very long so it is a good choice when you don't have much time."
3,The book was a disappointment after seeing the 1963 movie.,"I saw the 1963 movie version of this book when I was about 10. I am now 44 and still haven't recovered. I have just finished reading the book and was totally disappointed. I did realize that it isn't so much a haunted house book as it is a psychological thriller. Still, I thought the horror part wasn't very horrible and the psychological part was not very well explored. If you want to be scared, see the 1963 movie. I know it changed me for life."
2,Not very Engrossing or Scary,"I found the book to be rather slow moving and not very suspenseful. The ending was of no surprise. Perhaps this ""classic"" has not aged well. By today's standards it is downright tepid."
3,Didn't live up to hype,"I am a hard-core fan of horror stories. I've read tons. But after reading review after review of how this was the scariest book people have ever read, I must say I was quite disappointed at how unscary it was. It takes about 70 of the 182 pages before the group arrives at the house, taking up valuable time. As for the whole story, I would say it's maybe 70% character development, and 30% action/suspense/horror. It had its scary parts, but there just weren't enough, or the book wasn't long enough. I did, however like the unexpected ending twist. I recommend this book as a good quality book to read, but if you're looking for quite a scare, there is better out there."
3,"HO HUM...Tiring to read, not much punch.","Maybe I'm too tied up in the mainstream horror genre, but this book did nothing for me. Reading it was a chore, and it didn't scare me at all. I kept waiting for something scary to happen, but it never did. After reading the ending, I was glad it was over."
3,Overpraised,"This is a potent, subtle, and menacing novel, but it has a glaring flaw for me: the dialogue.The characters are all absurdly eloquent; it's a non-stop barrage of fanciful banter - so unbelievable it undermines the story. It's especially unlikely that Eleanor, described as a bleak mousey woman who for many years has known no society but her invalid mother, would suddenly be quipping as effortlessly and whimsically as Zelda Fitzgerald at a cocktail party.This sort of dialogue is especially grating when it persists past the initial scares: these people would be on edge, babbling perhaps, but not in witty, perfectly structured sentences.Personally, I couldn't get past this problem."
2,Slow moving-not at all as scary as the original black/white,"I am a big fan of the original black/white film. After seeing the remake, I decided to read the book to find out which was closest to the book. I was extremely disappointed. The book was slow moving and the scary segments were few and far between. Nell was unrealistically naive, for a woman who supposedly took care of her mother for so long. It was painfully long. I know the book was written in the 50's, but there is no comparison to the black/white film, which far surpasses even the remake with all its special effects! This book was not only a waste of money, but also a huge waste of time."
2,Disappointing,"If you see the movie, don't read the book. I read this book in two days because it was very suspenseful, but nothing like the movie. The ending, I felt, was an easy way to finish a novel that had so much potential. This started out to be one of the scariest books I had ever read then turned into a story not about a haunted house by a woman with an overactive imagination. See the movie if you want a scare. However, I was disappointed by the ending of the movie too."
3,Interesting novel study; not scary at all,"I was disappointed in this book. I expected it to rival ""The Turn of the Screw"" but I found myself rushing to finish it just to see if there actually was ""a scary part."" The characters and point of view are interesting; Jackson creates unique characters and voice. The images and relationships among characters and the best part of the book, but I must admit it's boring when it comes to creating fear. I wish I could have loved it as much as many readers do, but I'm giving it away because it's so disappointing to keep looking at it on my bookshelf."
3,"Jackson, The Haunting of Hill House","The Haunting of Hill House was pretty much what I expected it to be. I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. I didn't think it was something incredible or memorable. It had some very creepy moments in it and an abrupt ending fitting for a classic horror novel, but, in my opinion, not much really happened. I understand that the novel was about building tention and unreality but, for this story, it didn't work as well for me as books like Rosemary's Baby. That is the only book I can compare this one to. Hill House also has that erie dream-like feel to it which makes it difficult to know what is real and what isn't. Again, this seems to be what Shirley Jackson was attempting to do. I definitely want to read more of her books, especially We Have Always Lived In the Castle, but this was just another book for me with my interest mainly being held in the middle rather than the beginning or end."
3,Didn't fulfill my (perhaps inflated) expectations,"Based on numerous reviews of this purportedly classic haunted house story, I anticipated a delightful descent into spine-tingling terror. Alas, I fear I've sampled themes of fictional horror too often in my life. I'm apparently inured to their effects, a condition made evident as I yawned my way to the story's deflating conclusion."
3,"Not as scary as I'd hoped, but interesting","This one won't keep you up at night, but it might keep you thinking for a few days. There is a creepy spookiness, an uneasy strangeness that pervades the story, but nothing dramatically terrifying or shocking. In fact, even when the paranormal events start to become more and more overt, there is still a lazy disinterested nature to the narrative.This is one of those books that makes for a good rainy day read, but it isn't the dramatic, gripping horror story the title suggests."
4,The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson,"In this Story of mystery and terror, author, Shirley Jackson,tells a wonderfuls story of a group of people who are put into the ultimate haunted house. The Haunting of Hill House, A good read for all ages, is a timeless classic catching the very essence of human nature, when it comes to being scared. It's up to the main character Ealeanor to solve a family mystery as old as Hill House itself. If she can survive the encounter.~Mary @ DHS"
3,A nice old tale,"I actually liked the black and white movie version better. There just wasn't enough of a ""ghost story"" there for my liking."
2,still waiting......,"I read this book for a book club pick. (The only reason I kept reading!) I kept waiting to get into this book. It never happened! What a disappointment. I wanted to like it, be scared, etc.---never happened."
3,Difficult to Review,"Shirley Jackson has some great stories, but this book is difficult. The characters are very stereotypical, the dialogue not very good, and the by page 70, we finally hear Dr. Montague's experiences about the house and why they are all there. Why is it difficult to review, you may ask. Mostly because, for it's time, and the amount of horror stories out during this time period, it's good. It's a slow build story, and it is mostly a good one simply because of Shirley Jackson's writing. Not necessarily because of what happens in the story."
2,It was slow moving and built up to absolutely nothing.,"The novel had a good premise. However, it was not the best horror novel I have ever read. It could have been better if we had known for certain whether Nell's deamons were mental or actual. The author never really clarifies."
1,Did I miss something?,"I was so excited to read this book. I love the haunted house genre- movies, books, etc. I was extremely bored throughout this entire book, and hung in there thinking..""it must be about to get really good."" There are so many good reviews of this book here on Amazon. I'm still scratching my head.Uninteresting characters, unsubtle spooky events (that weren't scary in the slightest). I'm glad it wasn't any longer.."
2,A scary book??,"I heard so much hype about how scary this classic book was, that I quickly bought it, looking forward to enjoying a fright. I found this book to be nothing special, the dialogue among the characters was comical and, at times, ridiculous. Any book by Stephen King is superior to this simple novel."
3,Rare,"As awful as this sounds, I enjoyed the movie version of ""The Haunting"" much better than the book...and that is a rare thing for me to admit! Worth reading, for the sake of the author, who is brilliant...but not my favorite Shirley Jackson work."
2,Maybe I got the wrong book...,"that's exactly what I thought when I started reading The Haunting of Hill House because of the glowing reviews that I had read. Well, it was the correct book and I just couldn't get into it. The characters were fairly interesting, but the story was slow and can I ask all the 5 star reviewers - what part exactly was scary? I wanted to like this book, I wanted to be scared, but it just didn't happen. I gave it 2 stars because I liked the story line. And no, I haven't seen the movie. Maybe I'll try The Turn of the Screw, is there a good scary book out there that isn't blood and guts and foul language????"
5,One of the best American writers of this century,"Who is better at finding the chill at the edge of ""normality""? Certainly not Stephen King (who is now writing 50 pages worth reading out of 732 in ""Bag of Bones"" for example). ""The Haunting of Hill House"" concerns itself with loneliness, madness and MAYBE the supernatural. Shirley Jackson found evil and menace in the every day: the small New England town, the picnic by the river. If you need rotting corpses popping up out the cellar to disquiet you, by all means try other ""horror"" writers."
2,Dated ... was this ever scary?,"The classic status and claims of it being the origin of the archetypal American horror story - and my love of scary books - got me to buy this. The first 80% of the book is the cheery 1950s style setup, and the last part is the slightly tongue in cheek, seen from a distance style horror scene. You may have to read a few scenes twice to realise something mildly supernatural was happening that the characters found mildly frightening. At least they got a mild thrill, but this is one big YAWN!"
5,Great horror novel!,"This is an excellent horror novel. Very suspenseful. Most of the action is in the readers imagination, which always makes for a terrifying experience."
4,a book about one person's disappearance from humanity,"This book was very good, in my opinion. Eleanor was probably never quite ""normal"" and being in this house around whatever being it was inhabiting it, she just went over the edge. By the end of the book, she no longer identified with humans, but with the house. As I suspected, Shirley Jackson wrote a great book that is disturbing at a deep, personal level--like ""The Lottery."""
4,Stays with you.,"I read this book when I was about 12 years old, and, although it gave me nightmares, that didn't stop me from rereading it in my teens. I read many books, and often forget the plots within weeks. Not with this one. Even 25 years after my last reading, I still think about it on occasion, especially on a windy night when the house makes all those creaky sounds..."
5,scariest book I've ever read,"Like many other reviewers here, I read The Haunting of Hill House years ago and it haunted me for weeks. I still reread it occasionally and it STILL SCARES ME! What I love best about this book is that so much goes unsaid. We are given all the necessary information to piece the plot together but it is the unanswered questions that keep the book alive in our minds after we finish it.If I were not such a scaredy-cat, this book would make me want to read more about haunted houses (cold spots, poltergeists, etc.)The movie, of course, was just silly. Part of the problem was that it tried to answer all the unanswered questions in Jackson's book (and answered them very very badly. The idea of Eleanor being the great great grand-daughter or whatever....oh never mind. I can't go on, it was just too silly.)"
4,Truly Terrifying,"A book with class, which is also a classic book.A horror novel for the thinking man? Perhaps.I dont write long reviews - in this forum, anyway - so in a nutshell, i strongly recommend anyone who likes literature, and who enjoys a good scare, that you read this book, and once you have, try not to think about it too much because the more you think about it, the scarier it becomes.LR"
3,"Great writing, but not too spooky","The writing style used by Jackson keeps the book going at a reasonable pace. This book gives you the creeps on several occasions, but to use the word ""horrifying"", is a huge overstatement. Not that it wasn't interesting, somewhat suspenseful, and generally a good book, but anyone who consideres this horrifying needs to get out more often. I wanted a little more actual haunting and a little less banter. Still a very smooth reading and enjoyable book though."
3,A classic every horror fan should read,"Shirley Jackson wrote this tale with talent. Jackson weaves an intriguing tale that goes slowly but smoothly through the motions. The book isn't filled with creepy scenarios, but when they do happen, they're big. Mainly The Haunting of Hill Houseis a character driven story, focusing on the internal issues of each character, mainly Eleanors.The ending was a surprise, leaving me feel a hollow feeling in my chest. Although it's not filled with action, The Haunting of hill house is disturbing and will keep the reader enthralled. Check it out."
2,Too much,There's too much detail in the small things to get really hooked in... I don't know if I'm goin to finish it
5,Superb,I can't even begin to describe how much I love this book. Shirley Jackson manages to create a magnificent canvas of horror using only her words. Her character development is flawless and the chills she gives the reader are uncountable.
1,Not scary at all,"Very disappointing, I bought it for a scary read before Halloween and what a sham-not in the least bit scary."
3,The Movie is Better Than the Book,"Numbering the the 1963 film adaptation (The Haunting) of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" among my favorites, I finally read the book. Although a short novel at 246 pages, the book is tedious and slow, weighed down by dialogue and one character's interior reflections, instead of even a modicum of action.The movie was a faithful adaptation of the book. Reading the novel did not add anything for me. I think women are more likely to like this novel; men need a little more action. If you want to read an absolutely great horror story, try Peter Straub's, Ghost Story. I have met with no success in finding a horror story better than Ghost Story."
3,The haunting of hill house,"This book was a very quick read for me and the characters were VERY well written. A very basic ""ghost"" story. I must add that I am a huge Stephen King fan so it would be difficult for me to call this book HORRIFYING, it was written during a different time. Still worth reading but not a CLASSIC in my opinion."
2,A not-so-classic classic!,"This book has very little going for it. It was not exciting, not interesting, and definitly not haunting in any way. I was left wondering if some of the pages of my edition were missing. I felt that the story just plodded along with very little action. The book was like an outline for a really neat story. Maybe the film that is coming out this summer will have a lot of the substance that this one lacked."
1,Overrated,"This book does not deserve all the accolades it has been given. The author provides a good outline to what could be an excellent story but unfortunately does not deliver the goods. Too many things in the book are left unexplained - and that's just unacceptable (and lazy) - and the ending of the book is a prime example of that. The book is also very light on action to the point that the story becomes a bore to read (I.e. There's nothing that makes you want to turn the page and keep reading). There are no surprises, plot twists or rewards for the reader in this story whatsoever.I don't know what genre this book belongs in but it is certainly not horror (sorry). It probably belongs in the romance section because that seemed to be one of the major themes in the book (that unfortunately the author doesn't deliver on either).If you are looking for a scary read (or even a creepy one)- look elsewhere."
2,Not as good as claimed,"I watched the movie ""The Haunting"", which is based on this book, and thought it was horrible. Afterwards, I decided to check the book out to see if it was better than the movie. The first part of the book drags on for so long! There aren't even that many scary parts in this book! I reccommend this book only for those who are patient enough to work their way through the dull parts."
2,"This was supposed to, 'scare' me?","You have got to be kidding me. I found myself glancing at how many pages were left, thinking the suspense would get better.Nothing. It was very mediocre. I still haven't found a book to scare me just yet."
1,It wasn't all it was cracked up to be,"People kept telling me that it was like 10 time scarier than the movie. Well, that was entirely inaccurate. The movie was much better. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have even bought the book. It wasn't even scary. I was severly disappointed."
2,Horrible,I just finished reading this book and all I can say is its the biggest piece of trash I've ever read. The suspense in it was great but Shirly Jackson could have gave it a better ending. Nell crashed her car into a tree which in my opinion made no sense.
1,What a load of rubbish!!!!,"I googled a list of the most scary books ever written, and this book came up as number 1. Much to my joy I managed to get myself a copy. I was bitterly disappointed!!! The only thing that is scary about this book is the fact that people actually like it. NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS!! My daughter has told me more scary stories and she is 4 years old. People are saying that this book is a masterpiece. What a joke. Don't waste your time picking up this book unless you feel like being bored to death."
4,Chilling,Reading The Haunting of Hill House was so addicting. I seriously could not put it down. the whole house fascinated me. WHen i read this book i just went into the house. IT was such a thrilling book. NOw that i saw the movie i think i want to move in!
4,My view is don't watch the film before you read this!,"Yes I know I made the basic error, but I couldn't really avoid it. I was very young when I saw the excellent original black and white film. So I only learned then that it was based on a book.Somewhat later I got around to reading the book. For one thing it is remarkably similar to the original film screenplay, lines are identical on page as they are on the film, in certain areas. The quality of the book is not in question, it is a remarkable read, full of suspense and drama, but it all depends on whether you prefer your chills and frights from the page or the screen. Only then, to get the full impact of the storyline, can you decide whether to read this book first then watch the film or vice versa. It's upto you.My own personal choice would be to read this first, then watch the film, but like me, many of you who have already seen the film and not read this book will be left in a quandary. Don't be, this book is a great read, buy it either way."
1,Hideous.,"The point of a Shirley Jackson story is, ""Look how _evil_ I can be! Isn't it _fun!""_No. Actually, it isn't."
1,I guess I just don't get it.......,I saw the original movie version of this story when I was about 10 years old and still remember that it scared the daylights out of me. I guess I was expecting the book to be as scary but I saw nothing scary or even interesting about this book. It had little substance and was too short to be a good read. Frankly not worth the money I paid for the paperback.
1,Big disappointment,"This book was a waste of time. I expected a ghost story, a scary narrative. This was written as a 1940's british story, something you really have to be in the mood to read, and then, nothing happens! The synopsis stated that this is a subtle, psychological horror story, but it is so subtle, you don't know what is going on. Unless you are really into symbolism and looking for the 'deeper' meaning, save your money for a King or Koontz or Clark book."
1,These other reviewers must have read somethig else,"This is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. I was hoping for something that would be genuinely disturbing, and this book just put me to sleep. Don't waste your money."
1,Nothing thrilling about this thriller.,"""The Haunting of Hill House"" is not a horror, mystery, or psychological thriller. It is a complete bore. I could not understand Eleanor at all. One minute she was confident about herself, the next minute self-conscious. She liked Theo and Luke, and then despised them; I don't understand why she felt so close to the house. There were no super natural experiences, aside from thumping on the door. I felt this story was a total waste of time, and petty. The movie ""The Haunted"" is very loosely based on this book (same character names, different circumstances, but much more interesting), and I suggest you see it instead. This book is nowhere near a classic. I do not recommend."
4,nice & creepy,"It starts out slow, but it builds & builds, & by the time the house gets ahold of dear Eleanor, it's too late to go back! I was chilled upon finishing the novel.Don't expect skeletons popping out of closets, and ghosties running rampant from page one- if you do, it will only lead you into dissappointment.Jackson's writing is literary & quite concerned with character development & it has an old-fashioned horror story appeal.The ending makes this short novel, retrospectively, all the more thrilling.Recommended!"
5,Quite simply the greatest thing since sliced bread,"I've read it a few times. But just because it happens to be the best longfic ever written doesn't necessarily mean that I'm gonna read it yet again. Because the fate of a certain pathetic character is just too damn depressing.Here's my favorite bit: ""In either corner of the hall, over the nursery doorway, two grinning heads were set; meant, apparently, as gay decorations for the nursery entrance, they were no more jolly or carefree than the animals inside. Their separate stares, captured forever in distorted laughter, met and locked at the point of the hall where the vicious cold centered. 'When you stand where they can look at you', Luke explained, 'they freeze you.'"""
3,Poor Eleanor!,"Jackson's classic of the horror genre fell a little short of the mark for me; my feeling while reading the novel was that it was essentially a short story extended to novel form. It did have my skin crawling a couple of time, but not as much as I was expecting.I wonder if the horror classification has done the book a disservice; had I been looking for something different, like the human element in Eleanor's story, would I have read this differently? Or is this how the horror genre works?If you have the time, give it a read; it's not bad."
4,exc ellent psychological study,"again shirley jackson sees the world clearly, the meek imposed on by the strong, witness eleanors bullying older sister, the small town creeps and bullies, their sensibilites dulled by day to day life, witness the waitress in the cafe, throw in greed, jealousy and meaness and you have it, a jackson novel. seriously, elaenor is no more deranged than any other put upon dogsbody, she is simply unable to come to terms with herself and her life and stand up to the every day small atrocities she and everyone else has to cope with, and her way of breaking free is, well you can read it for yourself. She would have been better off selling the sisters car and using the money to move to france, isnt it true?"
2,"Disappointing, and left me with too many questions...","Perhaps I am the type of reader who likes things spelled out for me. When I finished reading this book, there were too many questions left unanswered. What did Theodora see in the woods that made her scream? It never said (or I missed it). Why did Theodora and Luke act strangely towards Eleanor during their outing to the brook? Why was everyone in the house somewhat cruel and uncaring towards Eleanor, and how was she being foolish? And from chapter 9 on, I was completely lost. The very end was completely absurd. Maybe I just didn't get it. I certainly didn't get SOMETHING. On top of all of that, the book wasn't even remotely scary. Anyone who read this book and can answer some of these questions for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Please email me your responses."
3,"3 1/2 stars Love the story, not the writing","Shy, depressed Eleanor is pulled out of her ho-hum life by an invitation to spend her summer at a spooky house partaking in ghostly investigations. Joining her in the experiment is lead researcher Dr. Montague, pretty boy and homeowner Luke, and flamboyant and beautiful Theodora. Mysterious happenings and an unreliable narrator leave the reader questioning long after the last page has been turned.This is my second Shirley Jackson novel and, as with We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Jackson spins a haunting and vividly realized tale that I both love and hate. I find her writing style irritating and her characters unsympathetic and unappealing, but her ability to craft truly terrifying, even if a little predictable, tales is unquestionable. If a reader is like me and really dislikes Jackson's writing style, I recommend pushing through to the end. The writing style may be torturous, but the books are short and the stories worth experiencing at least once."
1,The Let Down of Hill House's Haunting,"Never in all my love affair with books have I admitted that a movie was better than the book. However, I was terribly disappointed with the Haunting of Hill House. Just when the story began to get interesting, it was all over. All the reviews I read say how Shirley Jackson is a master of her craft. However, I felt like the book was very tame and unimaginative compared to the movie. I realize that movie watchers and book lovers are usually worlds apart, but I was disappointed in the many avenues which could have been explored in this story and were left uninvestigated. Overall, I was left with the impression that I had read a book that was written for pre-teens or early adolescents. What a let down. I still can't believe that I actually prefer the movie version of this story. AAAAUUUUGGGGHHHH!"
2,Very disappointing,"I read the book before I saw the movie and I must say that even before I saw the movie I thought this book sucked. It's not scary and even when it did start to get a little bit ""creepy"", it wasn't enough to make anybody really care. I do believe that the movie is great, but over all this book is not as great as everybody makes it out to be. Don't buy this book, borrow it from the library."
2,Ho Hum Hill House,"I've been waiting to get this book on Kindle for ages, and now that I've finished it, I'm returning it. **SPOILER ALERT** The story starts off well enough , but the main character, Eleanor, is such a head case with her constant annoying babbling and whining , that by the end of the story, I'm rooting for Hill House to do her in! I do, however, strongly recommend the 1962 Robert Wise film of this book, which took a mediocre story and turned it into one of the scariest films ever made!"
1,Overrated,"The front cover of this book says, "" Makes your blood chill and your scalp prickle....... Well, I must have read a different book. There was nothing scary about it. For a while I thought I was reading a comedy. The dialogue was simple and silly. The back cover of the book says that one of the characters (Theodora) is "" a lovely and lighthearted assistant"". Assistant? I must have missed something. As far as I'm concerned this was a waste of time."
1,I am amazed at the classic status and all the raves because I think it's trash!,The writing is sloppy; the characters stereotypes (tho' I will grant that Jackson may have created the stereotypes); the motivations weak; the story totally implausible; the internal logic non-existant. Is there some kind of mass hypnosis going on that accounts for the feelings of horror and pleasure among the readers?
1,"Movies are usually worse, Not in this case....","Obviosly after reading the book, you must realize that the author had no Idea how to write. The climax of the book was nothing compared to modern novelists. Having all discriptions lead up to nothing. It was worthless to read. It discribed every little detail. The detail ended in nothing."
5,Hail to Queen Shirley!,"Lyrical, poetic....void of blood and gore, but yet, terrifying. Shirley Jackson understood the human psyche the way few people do. She knew what it was like to be on the outside looking in....and through the character of Nell, she let us all know. Such a thin line between the sensible and the absurd....the things that go bump in the night, and the comfort and security the daylight hours bring...the desire to belong and to leave your mark on the this world, and perhaps the next. Shirley Jackson did just that in this superbly crafted thriller. It should be used as a textbook for all would-be writers who wish to excel at their craft."
4,Haunting of Hill House book,"This was a good book. I read it in one day. ""The Haunting"" (1999) is based on this book. I wasn't thrilled with the ending in the book but couldn't put it down. It's definitely a keeper."
4,What I think of this book,THIS book is what Stephen King based his Rose Red TV movie on.I found this book a BIT frightening but more suspenseful. I really liked it and feel it is a book all Sci Fi and Horror loving people should read.IF I find any faults in it at all it is only that the movie was better as the movie had an ending and the book just seemed to close without putting a finishing touch on itself!
1,The most overrated book imaginable,"Like many others, the new release of ""The Haunting"" prompted me to buy the book. I found the book to be so boring that I haven't made an effort to see the movie. The book was a complete waste of time. None of the characters are sympathetic, so as a reader, I didn't care what happened to any of them (which was basically nothing). The female characters have such a loose grip on reality to begin with that I didn't find the protagonist's mental breakdown to be surprising or frightening in any way. I recommend reading something else."
3,"STAY AWAY if you're a ""shallow"" reader","As a highschool student, it was quite difficult to understand. I found it very confusing and I was unsure what was going on much of the time. This book requires a deep understanding that much of the younger audiences probably would not have."
3,"Beautiful prose, Creepy, Atmospheric","NO spoilers here! I loved the author's writing. However much of the dialog did not make sense in conjunction with events occuring in the story. Maybe it was the time/culture of when it was written but I found myself thinking ""was it she/he talking about?"". I guess for me it was abit confusing. Nonetheless, it was still an interesting story with a few very creepy moments. The descriptions were so good that I could picture the scenery in my mind quite easily. If your looking for modern-day ""horror"" this may not be the story for you. If you love a creepy, atmospheric tale, you may find this very enjoyable."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with the reader from San Jose, CA. Where did Jackson come up with that dialogue? I found it to be totally unbelievable. If the characters had been real and honest with each other instead of conjuring up false realities about themselves, and had actually connected in some way, the book would have been far more frightening. The scary scenes in the book were scary, yes, but the poor dialogue and character development hindered my enjoyment of the book as a whole."
5,Wonderful,"The best haunted house story ever written. I read it at work, in the day time and I found myself looking around to make sure I was still there. There is a reason this book is a classic."
2,"Decent book, but definately see the 1963 Movie....","I for one saw the 1963 movie far before I read the book. While its rarely the case, I felt the movie edged the book in terror and character developement. I havn't seen it mentioned, but does anyone else see a similarity between this book (and movie) and Richard Matheson's Legend of Hell House? Its obvious Mr. Matheson heavily copied the style and scenario of this book (and later the movie Legend of Hell House which was decent in its day as well). I will say that if you enjoyed this book, Read Matheson's as he did it much better despite the obvious similarities."
2,"It was many things, but scary, it wasn't.","I will give it 2 starts just because it obviously interested enough people to make not one, but two movie versions. I am not surprised at all, however, that especially the second movie is very different from the story told in this book. This book certianly is not scary and is not really even about a haunted house. It seems to be more of a psychological thriller, but not even a very good one. THe last couple of chapters are completely disjointed from the rest and they make no sense whatsowever, and the end is a tru disappointment, as many questions are left unanswered. I think the book tried to make Hill House one of the characters, but it miserably failed. I really feel like I wasted time on this book. I can't believe how it can be considered a haunted-house classic, when the house itself does not do much at all."
3,"Uh, um. . .","Yes, I'm fumbling for words. Maybe my mind is too shallow for this deeply and subtley horrifying book, but the only thing reacting on my body was my skin. It was crawling with impatience. Silly dialogue, boring descriptions and a slow-moving plot line. Yawwwn. I'd rather read TV Guide.I expected a lot more from the writer of The Lottery. Maybe too much."
5,Brilliant prose,"Shirley Jackson's elegant, balanced prose does one heck of a job at creating the most spooky atmosphere I have ever encountered. A masterpiece of the English language. Jackson has created a terrifying malevolent presence in Hill House, a character whose gleeful evil still makes my skin crawl. At one point in the novel, the house starts making noise, and only some occupants of the house hear it. Insidious! Make the group turn on itself! Brilliant! I can do this book no justice. Please read it. Stephen King finds Eleanor's primary trait to be narcissism; while she is narcissistic, look for alienation and a profound yearning for acceptance. Eleanor doesn't necessarily know what she wants, but she doesn't have it. Jackson's account of Eleanor's journey to Hill House firmly establishes that character, and is, I think, even more effective than the oft-quoted and incredibly promising first paragraph of the book."
5,"Great,driving blues","If you are fan of electric Blues or Blues/Rock, you shoud get to know John. This album is GREAT all of theway through. John's solo style is really stand-out. Great Tracks on theis are the title, Self Made Man, where the whole bandgets into the act vocally at the end . . . listen and you will see what I mean. ""All that I know"" is probably one of the most pumping, great electric Blues tunes that you can run in to. Ride, Ride, Ride is also a Studebaker great that gets airtime on most Blues stations.In short, if you like the Blues and a really driving guitar, check this out! Turn it up to 11, put the hood down and FLY."
3,For the big fans only,"Her voice is still here! Packaging is delightfully and graphically provocative.Songs seem little bit ""silent"" compared to album versions, but you will enjoy Avril's voice for sure."
5,Clear PVC Tubing,I wanted this for a blowoff tube. The tubing is very flexible and works great for me. The sidewall is a little thicker than I am used to but I have made it work.
4,Some Things are Meant to Be,A charming fable about two guardian angles whose mission is to unite a pair of humans who are soul mates but apparently have forgotten it. This is the angels' third ( and final ? ) try. Can angels get exasperated ? Read and see. Romance readers will enjoy.
2,A film that deserves to be redone,This movie is based on the breakdown of Andrew and Sarah's marriagei would have like to have seen more about the friend ship between the princess and the Duchess. The most irriatating thing about this film was that it had a palace insider narrating the the film.The costumes were aweful and the charatcer they had for Dianawas laughable
4,helpful,I'm actually an immigrant to Northern Ireland. I live half an hour from Omagh and I found the film helpful in understanding a bit of the areas history. Most of the local people recount the story just like it goes down in the movie. I have friends here who lost relatives in the bombing and they testify to the intensity of the tragety which is well portrayed in the movie.
5,Perfect!,"I have the old version, which they don't sell on amazon, and it works perfectly. My kitten's teeth are whiter than mine! She loves her teeth brushed so much, I do it twice a day! The best thing ever!"
2,Brush too large for cats,"I really wanted to try this toothbrush for my cats. My cats let me cut their nails without much fuss, so I figured I had a decent chance with brushing their teeth. No such luck. The brush itself is huge in comparison to their tiny little mouths. I will probably throw this away."
4,Useful,"Even though my cat does not like it, this is a great product to keep his teeth clean. He had very smelly breath before. The toothpaste does not smell bad."
3,cats don't like their teeth brushed-start when they are kittens,"Well, good luck with this one! My cats are of a breed that has problems with ginivitis. I have 2 4 month old kittens, hoping to get them used to it so I can avoid anesthesia and vet bills for dental problems.First, the toothbrush finger cover is too big for a kitten's mouth. Second , felines don't like foreign bodies like toothpaste and brushes in their mouths. The actual toothbrush is too big for their mouths too. If I have to wait until they are bigger, I will likely lose an eye! Just didn't work out for me!"
5,"HEAR PAUL WARREN FIDDLIN ""ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL""!","WOWZER! PAUL WARREN'S FABULOUS ""ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL"" IS HERE ON DISC ONE, THE BEST RENDITION OF THIS GREAT BLUEGRASS PIECE EVER RECORDED. WARREN WAS THE LEAD FIDDLER WITH FLATT AND SCRUGGS' FOGGY MOUNTAIN BOYS FROM 1954-1969. ALSO, THE FIRST TWO DISCS CONTAIN THE ORIGINAL 20 TRACKS OF THE BEAUTIFUL 1972 DOUBLE LP ALBUM ""THE WORLD OF FLATT & SCRUGGS"". GREAT SONY REMASTERING, CLEAR BRILLIANT SOUND, WHAT A GREAT FLATT & SCRUGGS COLLECTION!"
1,just don't,This thing is over priced crap. Don't buy it. Look for a better product. Just don't buy it. It was warped right out the box.
5,GEOX ROCKS,Bought these shoes for my older son and he wore them all year and now my other son is wearing them and they still look good. Have had several pair of Geox shoes and they hold up good especially to active boys. Have had them in leather and canvas it doesn't matter and usually I get 2 kids worth out of them....you can't beat that.
1,I hate them.,"I have never had problems with any supplements except for this one. They are positively horrible. From the minute I swallow them (with a full glass of water!) they ""burp back"" over and over and over again. They must be the worst tasting supplement I've ever endured. I can't take them, and believe me I've tried. I finally am throwing out a very large bottle unusued."
2,Upset with product,"This item was shipped over 2 weeks after i ordered... When i received it, there were chips in a few of the shelves and one was cracked along the seem.... It was NOT the shipping, because the box it came in was in perfect condition... I cant believe they would see the awful chips and cracks on the shelves yet still wrap it up and send it out! For the $ I paid, was very upset... WAY too heavy to try to ship back.. so i am going to try and use some black paint to cover up the ugly mess.... Also, some weird marks on it.. As if the paint has already started to fade and you can see light spots to the wood... Other wise, the shelf fits perfect in my living room corner and doesn't seem to tip at all. Very sturdy.."
3,40 years on...,"Forty Years On has been such an important song in my life thatReggie Goff doing it adds to the fun.I never did understand what the ""Follow-up, follow-up..."" inthe lyrics meant. Unless that refers to a hymn.Please consider this for purchase. Other performers, add this toyour repertoire, especially on vinyl or CD.I am so tired of ""artists"" filling up their albums with unsatisfatory(even to their ""artists"" selves) tunes for the moolah, instead ofsongs that truly influenced them...some of those writers need themoney...they are not all Lennon-McCartney or even Carter-Lewis."
4,mi 4,The series lost a bit without the Landaus but Nimoy still did a good job and there was still good missions.
5,Great,"Mission Impossible is one of the greatest TV-Series ever shown. It was even better this year as one of my favorite actors, Nimoy, was one of the featured core group,"
5,Mission Impossible Season 4,"I was a fan of Mission Impossible when it originally aired.The Season four set is great, with Leonard Nimoy from ""StarTrek"" taking the place of the departing Martin Landau as themagician and master of disguise. The dvds play wonderfully,the transfer to dvd of such a dated series is superb. Bravo!!"
5,Excellent!,I watched this show when I was a teenager. This show still holds up! It was worth the money! Thank you Amazon!
3,Not as good as the previous three,"First off, I really miss Cinamon and Rollin. Paris doesn't seem comfortable in his role.I am also finding familiar plots. Compare The Numbers Game with The Submarine. In both, the IMF is trying to obtain a bank account number. Compare Fools Gold with other counterfeiter episodes. Even some of the guest actors reappear from earlier episodes.I am also tired of seeing studio buildings (The Submarine) and the same obvious locations in the suburbs, being used over and over again -- same buildings, different country, LOL. I should have stopped watching with the first three seasons. The fourth season just doesn't cut it with me."
5,Mission Imp Seas IV,"As with the other 3 seasons, this DVD set arrived in perfect condition and played every episode with out a glitch. One thing I wish -- a commentary on a few of the episodes, I realize it has been nearly 40 years, but most of the crew is still alive. Unlike Hogan's Heroes, where only Helga and LeBeau are able to discuss their memories of making the show. Even without, it is a great series to watch and watch again."
4,Not bad at all,Quality season...I think the first that has Leonard Nimoy (Dr. Spok from the old Star Treks) therein.
1,Unhappy customer,"I was very disappointed with the fourth TV season.The second disk of original purchase and replacement had color lines in the middle of the show, stops and then got frosen.I had to retern both of these sets.Until this problem exist I will skip this season"
2,The stories and writing take a nose dive,"The loss of Barabara Bain and the character ""Cinnamon"" are devastating. While Leonard Nimoy is a good addition, the stories and scripts are horrible compared to the first three seasons. The plot devices are even less plausible. Quit while you're ahead."
4,The wunderkind has grown up!,"Twenty two years have elapsed since the entire world stirred with the emergence on stage of this lavish teenager, but this fact by itself may become the razor's edge, because having reached the absolute maturity you are subjected to an unsuspected performance levels in order to justify the wrought legend by the same artist.Fortunately, he has known to deal about it with gratifying results."
3,Not as good as I hoped...,"I bought this CD before it was even available in the States. I was really excited about it because I'm a fan of Russell Crowe. Sadly, I was a little disappointed. There a few ok songs on here, but its mostly unforgettable. It's a good thing Russell is an amazing actor because his music career isn't the most impressive...at least not yet..."
1,Sour Grapes,"""Facing Athens"" has the feel of sour grapes: much to do with the author's experiences and interpretations and little to do with the modern city. Certainly no major metropolis is without its share of problems, but the thoughtful reader requires something beyond anecdotal evidence in support of a pre-determined agenda. I, for one, got the impression that the book was an angry ""letter"" to the author's estranged father. All well and good for a diary, but not for a book that purports to be an expose of a major European city. It is telling that not one footnote or authoritative source may found in its pages. For those among us seeking poetry or lyrical writing, I recommend Pablo Neruda for the former (five stars) and Nikos Kazantzakis for the latter (five stars)."
1,A Greek tragedy in writing...,"As someone who visits Athens regularly and sees the problems the city faces, I was shocked at how little the author did to try and understand why the city is as it is and found it amusing that the authour was happy to criticise but never attaempted to give a better way of doing things. I was even more amazed that it pointed to none of the city's virtues. It seems as if the sorry authour had determined what he was going to write on the flight over and then went actively looking for it while there. As some of the other reviewers rightly said, it seems like a bitter man's attempt at getting back at his father or fighting his inner demons. A truly awful attempt at journalistic writing."
2,A critical look at modern-day Athens,"Perhaps better named Confronting Athens, this is the author's highly personal exploration of his native city 20 years after his emigration to the US. The book is charged with subdued emotions which find their outlet in a critical look at the many less-than-rosy aspects of Greece's capitol city: corruption, unchecked development, pollution, discrimination... all of which are interspersed with short remembrances from the author's modest childhood. If you want a glossy description of Athens' amazing historical legacy and tourist destinations, look elsewhere."
4,flawed charm,"An exile returns home and these are his musings. Being Greek, he is under no obligation to invoke the ancients at every turn and he provides an unvarnished look at a city that is dysfunctional and charming at all once. He'll speak of Greek racism (the Albanians are blamed for nearly everything, the Gypsies for the rest), the total disaster of traffic through the city center, and the pull of the old neighborhoods now destroyed by callous development that is turning everything into concrete block apartment buildings.I've been to Athens and seem most of what he is talking about. The magic of Athens is not that it is perfect, but that in its great imperfections it still tugs at something inside you."
5,Vamos Dar a Volta no Guetho,"Timbalada is energy. Although there is no substitute for seeing them perform live, this is an excellent alternative. If you want to learn about Bahia and especially Timbalada, this is a good starting point. 'Perdido de Amor' is phenomenal along with 'Beija-Flor' and 'Meia-Hora.' If you're running out of energy on the stairmaster 'Canto Pro Mar/Ae,Ae' and 'A Latinha' will revitalize you (a timbalada revitaliza). If you've gotten this far and are reading this review, you will not regret buying this CD. Para pular sem parar."
5,Uma das melhores obras de qualquier artista,"Este CD ha que ser a melhor que eu ja escute- a partir da primeira cancao, me sinto levado pela muscia, pelo ""toque de timbaleiro,"" pela voz de Denny, pelo ritmo franetico do tambouro, ate que eu volte ao pais dos meus pais, o Brasil. Se for preciso descrever esta musica por apenas uma palavra, deve ser SAUDADES. Prove este CD, e vai cumprindo seus sonhos de ser levado embora, ate o Carnaval eternal. (Eu sei que meu portugues precisa um pouqinho de trabalho, mas assim e o preco que se paga por ser criado aqui nos Estados Unidos.) Talvez ao ler as letras dentro da caixa do CD, eu va aprender mais uma palavras !!"
2,Very Average,I'm a Big time Public Enemy Fan.but this disc really doesn't hit the spot.The Lyrics and Music really never hit.His Voice is still forceful but the material isn't happening.
3,Interesting...but still a little ridiculous,"This was an interesting book. I am, by no means, saying that I believe this conspiracy theory. However, it is very interesting. I am not old enough to remember any part of the actual death rumors, but I read the book because I was interested in anything I could get my hands on that involved the Beatles. While it is a little ludicrous to think that this death hoax was believable to people, it is interesting to see how the theorists found SO many clues that they felt supported the idea that McCartney had died and was replaced by some random wannabe. I also thought it was very humorous. The book discusses some of the ""clues"" that the Beatles planted and encouraged for their own entertainment....and I would expect nothing less from them. In all, I think most fans of the band would be interested in reading this as long as they take it with a grain of salt. It is a pretty short and easy read but still very interesting"
4,Great Nostaligic Read,"I loved reading this book, matter of fact I don't think I put it down til I was finished. For people unfamiliar with Beatle hysteria, it might seem a little odd, but I remember my friend and I going through those ""clues"" and some things were truly bizarre. We wore out records playing them backwards. We searched through photos with magnifying glasses. I only gave it 4 stars, perhaps unfairly, because I remember some ""clues"" that aren't in the book. Maybe every area of the country had it's own ""clues?"" If you know what people mean by ""Turn Me On Dead Man"" you'll love this!"
4,the walrus was paul,"the first thing anyone can say when reading a book like this is ....what in the world is up with this world. the book provides a real tuff look at the hoax and conspiracy around the ""death"" of paul in 1966 (he was supposedly decapitated in a car crash on november 9)and that an imposter posed as paul all this time. one thing i noticed while reading the book, was that it didnt just talk about the hoax, it taught you alot of facts of the beatles in general. this book is geared to beatle fans. but even a non-beatle fan will dig this book. i would have given five stars but i felt that the book could have used alittle more. it reads fast and nice and is easy to take in. overall a must read for anybody."
3,Minutia unlimited,"If you were around in the mid-60's and/or are a student of the Beatles, then you'll find this book ""interesting"". The author may or not be diagnosable with a mental disorder, but he sure does get into the minutia of the event of Paul's supposed death. I can't tell if the guy is doing this tongue-in-cheek or if he's serious, but you'll uncover more than you'll ever want to know. Though I enjoyed it, I had to give up about 3/4 of the way through. Enough, already!"
1,A paycheck for R. Gary Patterson - nothing more.,"I would never waste my own money on such mindless blather. I received it is as a gift from a well meaning friend who knows I am a Beatles officianado and thoutht I might enjoy it. First, it is just a useless rehash of an urban-legend / supposed conspiracy that's long since been accepted to be total rubish. So, who cares? I suppose there may be some who still do but I am certainly not among them. Secondly, it is fraught with inaccuracies - many of which are detailed in other reviews on this site. The logic throughout the book follows the original disinformational logic used during the initial ""revelations"". ie: A cat has 4 legs and a tail. A horse has 4 legs and a tail. Therefore, a cat is a horse. DUH! A recommended read only for the most addicted Beatle historians or those who have absolutely no life and all the time in the world to live it. I can only justtify my own time spent reading as Taking One for the Team. Please learn from my mistake."
1,You can read all these clues for free online.,"Don't waste your money on this poorly written book. Doing a quick search online for ""Paul Is Dead clues"" will unearth everything that's in this book and then some. R. Gary Patterson goes way beyond the beyond to provide ""newer"" clues that don't even make sense in the context of the originals. Be prepared to read this book once and then let it collect dust, or give it away to someone who needs to kill an hour. There are much better resources to give you a Paul Is Dead fix than this book."
3,Cute little book,"This is a cute little book for any Beatles fan, assuming you don't take the whole ""paul is dead"" thing seriously. There is some intresting Beatles history, and the book even talks a little about Charles Manson, which is on the subject of hidden messages.As far as rating the book goes, I gave it 3 stars for two reasons. First of all, like I said, it's a cute little book. To rate more than 3 stars (for me anyway) a book needs to more than ""cute"" and more than 208 pages (which includes the bibliography). Second, I feel there should have been a few more pictures in the book. If you are going to talk about pictures on the cover of the Yellow Submarine, show what it is you are talking about.Other than those two things, it's a good read for an airplane, a long afternoon, or something like that."
5,Great home copier!,"If you aren't looking for a volume printer, just one to make those misc copies at home, this printer fits the bill. I previously owned a Xerox personal copier that I had for many years and it died, and I figured that it would cost more to fix it than to just purchase a new one. Once you have a copier at home you can't do without, so I did quite an extensive search on the internet, and this was the cheapest that I found. The nicest feature is that you can turn it on and instantly make copies, because you don't have to wait for it to warmup....that's great for those single copies you want to quickly make on the run. I also like being able to make copies from books, which you can't make from your fax machine. The kids copy their chapters for homework and use those copies to travel with on weekends instead of dragging their entire load of books along. For ..., this printer is worth it. I have not had any problems with it so far."
2,"Parochial ""inside baseball"" backgrounder","This memoir, marketed as a Cold War sub history, will be of interest to insiders and afficionados of the details of the bureaucratic infighting and ancient (declassified) technical issues.For those not intrigued by name dropping and self-congratulatory engineering discussions, I suspect there are far better overviews of this amazing and central chapter of our nation's history."
1,"aka How I, Dr. Craven, singlehandly won the cold war","If this book was a song it would only have one note, me,me,me,me,me,me! It may be of some use to cold war history buffs but it will put off the average reader. Craven's main theme is how great, resourceful, brillant Craven is - especially when compared to everyone else in the Navy and the government. He settles every old score he ever had in his career. All of what he states in this book may be true. But it will leave you with a sour taste in you mouth and make you pity is poor wife and co-workers. Dr. Craven would have been much better advised to have employed a ghostwriter to redo his original script."
5,So That's What Pop Was Doing,"My Pop, who served on a Nuclear Submarine in the early 70's gave me Blind Man's Bluff last year, and this book last month... Now I understand him a bit better... and although I still regret the fact that he wasn't around much... I respect him more...I liked this book a little better than Blind Mans Bluff, it had lots of cool stories and was well written. It was fun to read."
2,"Somewhat interesting, but dull.","I bought the book after reading ""Blind Man's Bluff"". In the reviews, I perceived the book to be a sequel with even a little more detail. I was disappointed.Granted, I'm more action oriented than people oriented, but this seemed to be a book about the people ""behind the scene"". If you were involved, I'm sure it would be fascinating to discover the personalities and decision process behind the cold war submarine activity. I was looking for more detail on the activity. What the author told me was what he could not tell me and his political agenda. Unfortunately, that was not what I had hoped for.While interesting, I found the ""Silent War"" to be a slow read."
1,The Silent War ... The Story of J.P. Craven,"I was looking forward to reading this book. Made it almost through Chapter 2 and decided I was done. This book is more about J.P. Craven than it is about the Cold War and the courageous and commendable service that was provided by the Navy's Silent Service. If you want to know about how Craven saved the world, this is the book for you otherwise it is a great disappointment. Recommend reading (or re-reading) Blind Man's Bluff before opening this autobiography."
3,"interesting, but at times tedius","I picked up this book to gain an incite into the world of the submarine. I found myself far afield from what I wanted from this book. Hence I found myself pushing to finish the book. Mostly, I guess, this is my fault. But I did find myself struggling and dissapointed."
5,A true and facinating glimpse from inside the skunk works,"I confess that I know and admire the author. I had the privilege to be a part of several of the major projects he managed and talks about. Taken together with ""Blind Man's Bluff"" , a tip-of-the-iceberg recounting of the submarine force in action, this ""tell as much as I am allowed"" tale of the technical and leadership story behind the operational triumphs fills in many of the blank spots in the story of how the Cold War was won without firing a shot! Like many of the participants in this saga, I am not free to speak openly about what was done in those programs during the Cold War. Suffice it to say that, just as I gave my wife and each of my sons a copy of ""Blind Man's Bluff"", I am giving them copies of ""The Silent War""."
2,very disappointing,"This is a dreadful book. Besides being a dull read the author seems to be on a big ego trip and spends more time telling us how important he is than explaining interesting events and technical matters. Over and over again, I wanted to learn more about incidents and capabilities that the author mentions. Instead, we get a steady stream of pathetic excuses about not being able to reveal national security matters and partial explanations about things which could have made the book a much more interesting one. It's all about Craven, so if you like books which are about events and details go pick up Blind Man's Bluff instead."
2,There's better stuff out there...,"OK, so it's a biography, not a history book or novel. However, that's not an excuse for shameless self-congratulation. The ""good stuff"" in this book is due to the subject material itself, not how its presented. There are better works on this subject. And to top it all off, the numerous grammatical errors point to the less than professional nature of this book. I expected better."
3,An Interesting Perspective on the Cold Ware Beneath the sea,"The book has is uneven but still interesting. The most interesting parts deal with the performance of missions - most of which have been disclosed at one time or another individually but this book brings them all together in one fabric and shows how they were inter-related which is nice. Some tedious sections containing auto-biographical information, personal reminisces, and ""I knew/know a lot but I still can't tell you"" kinds of things but, overall, worth reading."
3,The Silent War: The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea,"Not nearly as ""riveting"" as the book cover description claims. Due to the confidentiality of the subject matter, there is not much meat to any of the submarine stories. Those of us who served in the fleet of ""41 for freedom"" salute Dr. Craven and his accomplishments but much of this book is B-O-R-I-N-G. Too much a ""who's who"" of what committee he was on and not much more. It does provide some interesting descriptions of some of the Deep Submergence programs in the U.S. and is a good accomplice to several other submarine books on the market. As long as you recognize the context of what the book is, you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for some kind of ""riveting submarine thriller"", you may be disappointed."
2,Badly Made,"There is a reason why there is no ""inspected by"" slip in the packages of Reed & Barton's Impression flatware, it is clear that nothing has been inspected. Both sets bought in a local store, and one bought on line from Silver Spoon, were filled with flaws. There were pieces with spots missing stainless coating, a knife with a chunk out of its blade, pieces with wavy coatings, rough, poorly finished handle ends, black spots, and some pieces with a brown, gooey, tar-like substance that took Goo Gone to remove.The weight and design are nice but the quality? Non existent. I am surprised that an old-line company like Reed & Barton would trash its reputation with this level of incompetence"
3,"A great gizmo, a substandard camera","I really wish I had read some of the reviews before buying this camera. It is small, has tons of features, and is really fast, not to mention makes everybody around you, strangers or not, stop to look at it and ask questions. But the pictures it takes are just not a high enough quality to make it worth it. You could buy a cell phone that can play mp3's and take pictures as good as this camera, and thats a phone too. The zoom was terrible and lost all focus when used, and the mp3 player would be cool if there weren't so many restrictions on how to get music on there. All in all, I was really excited to receive, and really disappointed as soon as I tried to print my pictures, so I returned the product."
4,Versatility is the word to describe it,"If you're all about media quality this is not your best choice, this gadget do some of recording and playing media (jpg, mpg4/asf, voice and mp3) but it won't do the best recording or playing of one type of media. If you're all about getting snaps of everyday moments without warning everybody around with a bulky device, maybe it is one of your choices. The mp3 part is not for ripping anything that sounds, it is designed to avoid piracy and you have to own the source media. Excellent battery performance and accesories kit. Good manufacturer software including USB driver. Regular design of lens location, anyone who is not the owner will put their greasy finger on it."
5,I Wish I Could Give It 10 Stars!,"Mrs. Santa Claus is the best Christmas movie I've seen yet... I loved Angela as Jessica in Murder, She Wrote... And I think it is obvious that she is only getting better. Mrs. Santa Claus is a great movie, for anyone, any time, any where. END"
3,"Quite predictable, often cheesy, but very congenial","Although the plot could use some work as far as creativity, this is still an enjoyable family film. The high points for me included ""We Don't Go Together At All"", a sweet love song between two of the younger generation, and the consumate performance of Terrence Mann, who portrays Augustus P. Tavish. He is hilariously funny with all his facial and verbal expressions, and gives such a delightfully malicious rendition to his song, ""Tavish Toys"". He is the ultimate villain and has a rich baritone voice. No wonder he is a star on broadway. While Angela Landsbury, who plays the title role, is also enjoyable, I feel her talents were somehow misused here--her character should have had a lot more spunk. The rest of the cast plays adequately, with their own epithets. Enjoyable, if not Oscar material."
3,movie being censored by tyrants,"Why is this movie only in PAL format on DVD, hard to get and so overpriced? Could it be because it has women's rights philosophy in it and our whole country is being controlled by male supremacist Christians? Catholic Italian mob runs Hollywood and they do NOT believe in freedom for women. The Catholic church believe women should be ""Subject in all things"" and obedient to their male supremacist masters. We are in deep trouble. Our liberties stolen and eventually we will once again be enslaved completely. Fight for your rights. hopefully get this movie available soon. Angela Landsbury is a popular figure in these sweet movies, it makes me wonder why this particular one.Other than that - movie great. Old time women's rights, picketing in public and a revolutionary brave spirit."
3,A bit disapointed,"Entertained, though not too much inspired, Christmas story. The music and Jerry Herman's songs and Angela Lansbury's habitual captivation justify the vision of this history, a little bit foolish."
3,Regions,"I am uncertain how to 'rate' this one. I love it in one way. I had recorded it and was glad to find I could get it in dvd. My concern was I had never had a problem ordering something and being able to play it. I had no idea of ""regions"" and while I have been able to watch it on the computer that is Not where I wanted to watch it. I think you should do more in pointing out about these regions for those, like me, who know nothing about them. I sure hope I will be more careful when ordering again but if someone orders something from a different region I think it should be pointed out to them they may not be able to watch it without a computer. You know, some people do not have one so their money is wasted!"
1,Hated it!,Had to send it back because the it wouldn't play in my DVD player or my mother's for whom it was bought. Had to return it and ask for a full refund. Own this movie myself and love it and was looking to get a copy for my mother.
2,Mrs. Santa Claus DVD,"I can't play the DVD because it was giving me a message like this: ""Pleae eject the disc. Playbak is not authorized in your region. Region Code of this disc: * 2 **** So, if possible can your company give me a ""replacement DVD"" and I will send this one back, when your compnay gives me a ""Return Envelope"" Thanks!Dave LaneMerry Christmas and Happy New Year!!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Angela Lansbury is perfect as Mrs. Santa Claus. This is a very entertaining movie with fun musical numbers. Great choreography, songs, costumes and performances. Excellent family movie!"
1,Techniques of Crime Scene Investigation Interactive Training CD-ROM,"[[ASIN:0849321042 Techniques of Crime Scene Investigation Interactive Training CD-ROMI recently purchased this CD to help me study for an upcoming detectives test. prior to purchasing I read the one and only review on the item. The review was very negative, but I didn't listen and purchased it anyway. This study CD is WORTHLESS!!! The CD takes the parts of the book that are in bold font on puts it on a CD. I threw my $ away, but you don't have too. There was not one test question on my test that was on the CD. Save your $86 and buy something that you'll get some use out of."
2,Not The Original Hits,"Don't buy this CD if you want the original hit Stax recordings of the great Sam and Dave.These are all later re-recordings.I did give it 2 stars,but,only because ANY Sam and Dave recording is worth more than 1 star,even inferior re-recorded versions of their songs."
3,"Rich in techniques, hard to pick out the ideas","I was inspired by this book to focus on the future more in general, and in particular to deliberately imagine the future as a spectrum of possible scenarios, which I could watch emerge and either became more likely or fall away as possibilities.The book was very dense reading, really an MBA text, and had some good case studies and methodology description.Lot's of comment about the author's reputation and consulting gigs.I was surprised to learn that the French had made so many very, highly, significant, and important contributions to strategic thinking."
4,Creative for creating future,"Always disappointed with the stereo-typed future forecasting methods too popular, I have been finding a new way of thinking.Scenario planning seemed to be a very fresh tool . Rich real cases were much interesting, so, very useful for my job in the forecasting.But, follow-up informations for the scenario planning application would be better one for many practitioners and scholars.Inspite of that, it seemed superior to any other books ever before, because it included much new sight and experiences."
4,solid entry in series,"This is no better or worse than volumes 1, 3, & 4. A bit off from volume 2 so no 5 star from me. The fellow that gives it 2 stars seems to have been dissapointed because of his somewhat odd expectations, not because this is a clunker."
2,Be Careful! Not the full tracks!,"I bought this cd for the moonraker track by formeost poets and when I got it found that it only had 5 seconds of the song! Many of the tracks listed above are less than a minute long. The one good thing was it was shipped to me in less than a week, which is impressive considering it came from England."
2,Historical,"This book had lovely pictures and the text on African American History was interesting, but what it lacked was information on how to actually plan a ceremony. When and how do you jump the broom, what words can you use, what are your guest doing while you jump the broom. It left me still searching for information. Hopefully the follow up is better."
3,Afrocentric wedding book.,"This book calls itself a wedding planner, but I don't recall too many sections that actually required the reader to ponder what they wanted, or for actually getting organized within certain sections.What this book suceeded at is suggested by it's title: I really wanted to use a broom in our wedding ceremony by the time I'd finished this book.Sadly, not much else in the book suited me. It assumes a wedding where everyone involved is black, where there's a close community full of older friend and relatives, and where Afrocentric items are readily available or where you're willing to do mail-order and thus not get to bargain-hunt.For me, this book was only good for inspiration which, while nice, is less than what the title prepared me for."
1,Not at all what I expected,This book was not at all what I expected. I really wanted more information on the ceremony inclusion of jumping the broom itself. This book gives a history of African-American weddings. It really does not give any usable planning advice. It really shouldn't be titled a wedding planner at all.
3,This review is about the 2003 revision.,"The book was ok. I really didn't read it in it entirety, but from what I read I really would not rely on this book. I would take bits and pieces."
3,edit edit edit,Not as good as the first. The book could have had 100 or so pages shaved off and been a much tighter and more interesting book. I battled my way through this book on the strength of the second. The premise is original and the characters remain original. But much of this book doesn't use that originality to captivate the reader.
2,Much too predictable,"The best fantasy novels--George R. R. Martin's series, for example--contain scenes and plot twists that are so unexpected and clever that the author's talent and imagination amaze the reader. The first book in this series--The Bone Doll's Twin--was full of promise, especially regarding the stresses and potential conflicts to a woman who learns (but does not easily accept) that she is temporarily living inside the skin of a man. Unfortunately, the second volume just has nothing interesting or surprizing to offer. All the main characters think, act, and do precisely what you'd expect (except for Korin, the one character on whom the reader cannot get a solid fix). It's as if the author, although she writes well enough, does not have the skill to develop the interesting plot potentials she created. Maybe a co-author would be helpful for volume three."
3,hidden warrior seemed to skim the surface,This second book seemed more like a memoir that skimmed the events and places Tobin encountered. It didn't really deepen the characters of Ki or Tobin and often seemed forced. HW wasn't as creepy or moving as TBDT but HW did advance the story and I'm looking forward to the third book.
2,I wanted to like this trilogy,"I loved the Nightrunner books by Flewelling and I wanted to like this new trilogy as well but after reading Bone Doll's Twin and Hidden Warrior I've got to come to the conclusion that you just can't like all of an author's work.While Flewelling still brings her signature style and storytelling ability to these books, compared to the Nightrunner characters I find the characters in the Tamir trilogy unoriginal and stereotypical. The plot seems to be loosing it's center and rambling and it just doesn't hold my attention the way the Nightrunner books did.I really hope that Flewelling will finish up this trilogy and go back to the characters she drew me into her world with in the first place. Somebody let me know when the Nightrunners are back."
1,BORRRRRRING,"I didn't read the first book in the series and after the first chapter of Hidden Warrior felt I didn't need to.The book just went on and on and on and on and on as if she knew she didn't have enough material to do a trilogy but had agreed to so she dragged in everything she could think of and then some. Every fantasy cliche one could think of is in the book. Her one original idea--the basic premise of a girl living in a boy's body--after a while didn't ring true.I have read and liked Lynn Flewelling for years. Was sorely disappointed in this book. What a waste of talent. I noticed in one of the reviews the suggestion that she get a co-author; according to Amazon's listing, she had one."
2,Funny Gore,"I really liked the film Flower of Flesh and Blood it has the best special effects on a gore movie, also the snuff vision version on the dvd is an experience. The other movies are interesting, Mermaid in a Manhole is good, but he others are funnier than I expected them to be. The box set is pricey and hard to find, great extras, but try to watch them first before purchasing the set."
2,Not as heavy-duty as the last pair. Rather light weight and seem to have a lack of quality.,Not very heavy-duty as the last pair. Rather light weight and seem to have a lack of quality.
4,Why not me?,"I am a 17 years old girl/woman.My parents prevented me from reading this book.Untill I finally got their Ok to do it.I found it very interesting, taught me things from a couple I had never seen in other places (maybe because I hadn't read many books about it)I found the concept of why we motivate very interesting, and also help me to discuss it with my parent.After that I also read the other book of Seeker, Tales for still growing up persons, and I found it very interesting too (see my comments on that book there)"
5,don't miss it,"I really liked it a lot. It moved me to think and ""heart"", as the author says, all the issues.I liked specially the chapter about how much time it takes us to realize our ""personal issues"".A book to be read more than once."
1,Be Very Careful,"I have never given anything a one rating. I feel bad doing it, but in this case feel I must. I am a nurse and taking blood pressures is a part of my everday life. I bought this with the idea that I would make it a little easier on my patients, without them having to feel that tight grip around their arm. Well, there is a reason for that tight grip,you get an accurate reading that way. I had all the best intentions in buying this product. But it's readings are just plain inaccurate. If you suffer from hypertension(high blood pressure) this product could be dangerous, as it may not be truelly letting you know that your blood pressure has elevated. It runs way below what a true blood pressure runs. Omron makes great products, I would recommend one of their arm cuff blood pressure machines, you will get a much more accurate reading. Hope it is helpful."
3,very easy to use,This stuff is very easy to use. I bought it to my mother as gift last month. My monther like it very much but she mentioned to me that the measurent is kind of lower compared with measurement in clinic. I am not sure which one is more accurate. that's why I gave it 3 stars.
2,Not accurate,The readings are not true.....I made comparison at my doctors office.The wrist cuff does not capture my elavated blood presure. My doctorsuggested that I continue to use a blood presure cuff.
2,Not accurate,"Got the machine after my doctor put me on medication and asked me to monitor my blood pressure. On paper the machine should be easy to use and accurate. In reality I keep on getting error messages, and each reading is different than the next one I take right after, so I am not confident that the machine is accurate. I will send it back."
5,The man who started Western Movies,Watch these movies by WS Hart and you will know where every Western Movie artist learned to act. He was the cowboy of the movies.Probably still is.
4,Humid handles,By its had interior it is precise to dry the rackets to anter to put them because the handles remain humid and can take scent badly
3,Just OK,After I bought this item it was not as good as it sounds on the radio and the computer I do not use it and would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Enchanted by the characters,"The Brewer's Star is a period novel about a family of the late 1800s, when women are supposed to follow their men and dedicate themselves to their families. The heroine in this novel is trying to fulfill her vocation but faces a society that does not accept her. A gifted voice living in the times of Wagner and the great Opera composers of the time, she wants a career, she wants a family, she wants everything. She is a modern woman facing the same problems that all women do. Weber is a master of dialogue and uses it to convey the characters personality, their opinions, desires and fears. The reader is transported to the times of early immigrants in the town of San Antonio and Weber describes a way of life, success and hardships with flair. I could not put it down this novel one minute."
2,Too pricey,All of this stuff is way to expensive and just common stuff we can make on our own with things we have in the cupboard.
4,Nice gadget. Too bad it doesn't have a backlight.,"Nice and small gadget.Although the screen has an excellent contrast, the backlight is still needed at night (not a big problem though). The remote sensor is great."
3,No humidity tracking as advertised!!!,I just opened the box and was VERY disappointed to find out that this does NOT track humidity as stated in the listing. I wanted to know the humidity too. Now I've wasted money and time. Nice...
5,Our Family Loves It!,"We have four of these in the family now. Along with ours, our daughter and son-in-law have one, as do my parents and in-laws. Being retired out here in the Arizona desert, it just takes a quick look at the thermometer to know if I want to get out to do some yard work, or just lay back in my favorite chair and watch an old movie."
5,Nice and simple,"This is a nice basic indoor/outdoor thermometer, easy to setup, accurate, inexpensive. The only thing I'd wish for is probably a backlit display, but that would drain the battery more quickly. Overall, excellent."
4,Glorious,"For fans of Portishead and Massive Attack this will fit well in your collection. A beautiful, and underrated debut."
5,"Hard, but good","You have to take your time to listen to this one. It's not Britney Spears or Ricky Martin or Cher, it's no easy music. But it's really quality music. ""Merge"" is really uplifting and strange. ""Gorecki"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It takes U up to the sky, and makes U ride the clouds until you can't breath anymore. ""Cotton Wool"" and ""Trans Fatty Acid"" are really nice, ""Zero"" gives me tears. Love U, Lamb, waiting for the third album."
3,Not all that impressed.,"I will admit, however, that the man behind the beats really knows what he's doing. The music on this album is absolutely amazing. The woman's voice does not really appeal to me. The words are occasionally foolish and I just get bored with it sometimes. Believe it or not, I can't stand ""Cotton Wool."" I find it to be barely listenable. Songs like ""Lusty,"" ""Gorecki,"" and ESPECIALLY ""Zero"" are still very good and stand out on this otherwise bland album.Not exactly trip-hop's best. Look into both Portishead albums, ""Maxinquaye"" by Tricky, all Massive Attack albums and some Hooverphonic and Red Snapper on the side. You won't be disappointed with them - TRUST ME."
5,Musically different amongst other drum & bass bands,"Great album...Have to admit, didn't like it at first, too different for me at the time. Found it a year later, LOVED it, I have recommended it to at least 10 of my friends. Other break-beat/drum & bass bands rely only on loops and samples, but if you saw these guys live, you'd eat your shorts! I saw them support their more recent ""Fear of Fours"" album, and they rock! Andy does double-duty with keyboards/sound modules and turntables, while Louise has a great voice and stage presence. Melodically and structurally, their music is not common, which is nice. Several of their songs constantly change meter, and they don't seem to be stuck in the same rut that other bands are: the same damned rhythm/melody for every single one of their songs! I can't wait for Lamb to come back to the SF Bay Area in February, and it seemed like they loved Bimbo's 365 Club as well."
4,This is a good CD,"This is a good CD. A lot of reviews say the lyrics are not very good. Well they are not as bad as people say, any way this kind of music is More about moods and sounds, and Lamb really deliver in those departments. I am still glad I bought this CD! ""Lusty"" and ""Zero"" are both great songs, and so is the rest of the album, This cd is full of compelling vocals and great beats. Lamb seems to get compared to everyone from ""Olive"" to ""Baxter"" to ""Spicehouse"" to ""Hooverphonic"". I think Lamb are totally unique and have no connection to Anyone but themselves. Overall this album is a great mix of drum n bass with a bit of jazz, some trip hop and a beautiful voice. A great addition to any modern music collection."
3,Two gorgeous songs!,"Lamb sounds like Portishead gone jungle. There are two or three standout tracks in this album. Particularly good is Gorecki, with incredibly emotional lyrics and a sample from the composer's Third Symphony. Also look for the hidden track at the end of the album: it's a jazzy version of cottonwool, wich is way better than the original. Some of the songs are weak, but it is worth it for those two songs alone. They are gorgeous."
3,Average with a beautiful ending,"Lamb's debut album is a pretty good album. Musically It has an average sound of the genre, It's Trip Hop with Drum 'N' Bass beats. Musically they remind me of Goldie with vocals that are like Bjork. I admit the vocals can be annoying at times but once you get use to them their alright. The disc is all average but heart of the album is the last two songs. They are nice piano soft touchy songs that are worth the whole album just for them."
3,smoky walk,"this record has surely it's ups and downs but on the whole it lacks a musical balance and rigidity (is that correctly spelled :)?. i liked: gorecki and merge... verrrrrrry (stress on ""r""-letter) much. for sure it is a material that can be mixed endlessly."
5,This album has taken my soul,"This album has sunken into my soul, like so many late night coffee and nictotine trips, wallowing in the cold wrap of an autumn night. I thought Portishead had me licked but Lamb's CD is abruptively chaotic and consistently tight. Not like I am some super clubber know it all but if you like Portishead, Massive Attack, and DJ Shadow for a tight mix lamb should right up your alley."
5,shivers down my spine,"Do you know the feeling when you listen a CD in a store and you're instantly taken by it? You don't want to put it down, and you think you've found the best music ever. It was like that with Lamb's debut album. The wonderful thing is, it just gets better and better the more you listen to it. This is intelligent complex highly emotional music. The Lamb musicians know each other well and they know how to get the best out of each other's talents. This is a CD made with love."
2,jumps on the bandwagon and doesn't suceed,"Lamb basically jumps on the trip hop band wagon, their niche being the use of drum and bass.Basically it's a weak drum and bass excusion with a poor mans Bjork on vocals. Tunes lack melody and range from the dull to the boring. I'm sure it's fashionable to like this band, but don't belive the hype -save your money for a massive attack or a morecheeba album."
2,MIXED,This CD has a couple tracks that are totally amazing. The rest are so bad that it almost ruins the experience.
2,"Has it's moments, but is missing the magic.","There are lots of good things about this disc: nice groves, hipster vocals reminiscent of Bjork, cool sounds, some deep bass. Despite all it has going for it, at the end of the day Lamb just doesn't deliver the goods. The sound ideas and solid execution need some sizzle to seal the deal. It just isn't there. In this genre, I'll stick with Portishead and Bjork. (Really rates 2.5 stars, but I'm forced to choose between 2 and 3.)"
3,Great music vs Awful lyrics,"The music is excellent. No arguement there. But for me the experience of listening to this is totally soured by the risable, adolescent lyrics. It appears that only one other reviewer (so far) has noticed this, or is bothered by it. But, even the (almost constant) stream of lyrical cliches would have been forgivable, had it not been for the utter preposterousness of the singers delivery. She sings her lyrics with all the delusional conviction of a tiresome 14 year old, utterly convinced she has 'had these, like, amazing mysterious thoughts' and it is her compelling destiny to bestow new truths on us all. Oh dear."
2,Massive Disappointment,"After hearing a Lamb song on a Cafe del Mar compilation, I logged right on and bought the self titled CD. Ouch! Impulse buying strikes out again. There is nothing on this CD to set it apart from anything. It is a mediocre blend of many popular styles without bowing to any. The best word I have is- MUNDANE. Absoutely safe and devoid of talent or adventure. ... It turns out that the song I had heard was a remix."
2,It isn't good,"This music isn't good. I'm not saying that beacuse it's strange; I dig stuff a lot stranger. I'm not saying it because I don't like the genre; I like Portishead and Goldfrapp. I'm just saying it because this music has nothing too it. There are good moments, but the songs here lack direction. Some genres can get away with that. This one can't."
2,These guys are /so/ overrated.,"Lou is an OK singer, for a pop music group, I suppose, but her voice is nowhere even close to the standard that the hype makes out. Sheesh, guys, the way people fawn over Lamb, you'd think that she was the next Yvonne Kenny or something.I reckon if it wasn't for their track ""Gorecki"", then these guys would never have ever been noticed, and rightly so, IMNSHO. And the only reason they were able to make that track is by hitching a ride on the name and work of a real musician, i.e. the real Henryk Gorecki."
1,One lamb that needed to be sacrificed,The first 17 seconds of the first track impressed me beyond any expectations. Subsequently a vocal track somehere between a drunken transvestite Liza Minelli impersonator and Madonna ruins whatever wonderful ideas placed on the track. A great disk for highly selective mixing or sampling.
5,"Exceptional, Brilliant, and Unique!!!","alhtough this cd isn't like mediocere generica, is still has the leftover crack feel to it. I'd say that they didn't sell out at all. They merely perfected their music. This CD is a MUST BUY, has awesome riffs, nice slow orchestra bridges, and tight hard fast everything else. BUY THIS CD."
1,Moronic; at best.,"Leftover Crack is embarassing to listen to if you have a brain.Let me make it clear:Yes. Leftover Crack is anti-racist (so they say).Yes. Leftover Crack is anti-homophobic (so they say).Yes. Leftover Crack spews out most of the standard ""punk"" ideals.And yeah, that's all great and nice. But they also talk about killings cops... all the time. Since when do any sensible, ""liberal"" people condone killing??? Of anyone?I had the displeasure of seeing this horribly stupid band in concert. The drunken, mullet-headed singer mentioned in his high-pitched wicked-witch like voice that each song was basically about the same thing: cop-killing.If you have a brain, do YOURSELF the favor by avoiding this mindless garbage."
1,...what,"i dont understand, regardless of how ""punk"" you are, how you should be happy about 9/11. all that did was create a vehicle for people to go and launch a war and take away our as well as other's freedoms! random listenings/probings...dead people the world over...the draft bill thats in the process of being passed (which will almost definitely make it thru cuz we're in a ""time of war"") so we can go invade iranand this is a good thing? bullshit"
4,RAW EMOTION TAKES YOU ON A RIDE THROUGH REAL LIFE!,"THIS IS REAL LIFE STUFF. IT'S INNOCENT,AND THEN IT'S JOLTING WITH LYRICAL CONTENT THAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU RIGHT THERE EXPERIENCING THESE THINGS. FROM SCHOOL DAY BOYISH CHARM TO A YOUNG MAN IN TROUBLE,THROUGH LIES & DECEPTION,FINDING HONEST LOVE,THEN.... LOSING IT AGAIN. IT'S NOT FLUFFY FAKE MUSIC IT'S THE TRUE SOUNDS OF THE GUITAR THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE.AND VOCALLY UNIQUE. IF YOU CAN'T TELL BY NOW ,I LOVE IT!!!!!"
5,The Real Thing...,this guy has a new kind of country talent..it's not the same old thing. There's a lot of emotion and truth coming thru...
4,Good Work Pants,"My boyfriend really liked these pants, especially the color. The only thing I think could be a little better is that they are very hard and stiff. I understand they need to be but I still think they could be a little more flexible."
3,Not Carhartt's usual quality,"When I received these pants, they were much more green than the picture shows. Also, on the very first wash, the color completely faded in the crease areas, so there is discoloration throughout the pants. Still ok for work pants, but the black ones I bought at the same time did not do that and are up to Carhartt's reputation."
5,Heavy Duty & Good Quality,"The pants were very heavy duty and of good quality. I purchased for my son who is 6'1"" and approx 155 pounds. The length and waist were good but unfortunately they were too large in the hips and thighs. Part of my rating for this product is the the company we purchased them from shipped them very quickly and they were packaged very well. They also accepted the return with no questions."
5,durable,"I ordered these pants for my dad who needed new ones. His last pair lasted almost 2 years and he wore them almost everyday for work or outside/woods work. The double front is key. By the time he decided (I begged him) to throw them away, they were covered in paint, bondo, torn knees, missing belt loops and a whole lot more!! They are extremely durable. They are worth the money."
1,Carhart less than what I expect out of them. Guess it's time to switch to Duluth trading for quality.,I purchased these because of the extensive history I have with wearing carhart clothing. Currently I am furious that I have to contact carhart because on the three pairs I purchased all three pairs have stitching errors so badly that they are falling apart at the seams literally. i am severely irritated not only because of this problem but then I find out this product is made over seas and not here in the USA. Shame on you carhart.
4,"Great pants, but kind of stiff...",I bought these pants for my live-in boyfriend and regardless of how much we washed these pants or how much he had wore them they were always wicked stiff.
4,Extremely Stiff,Just a little note to say these jeans are extremely stiff. I washed them and used extra fabric softener but they still are stiff. I am hoping once my husband starts to use them they will break in.
5,Yeah!,Great fit and feels like they will last a long time. I hope so cause they cost a lot but they are better then jeans for carpentry
4,"Good pants, long.","Good sturdy pants.I bought these in 32"" length since that is what I have always got most my life. These are really long though. I have to roll then up about 2 inches for them to look decent."
2,WRONG SIZE!!,In my first attempt I thought I ordered wrong. After reordering I ordered a 34w x 31L and my confirmation email said I ordered a 31x34 which is what happened the first time! I am not sure what is going on but I they are shipping right away and the first time I was only allowed a refund and not an exchange:( 80 bucks in limbo :(
1,Don't buy your Carharts here!,"Carhartt makes the best, most durable work gear I have ever used but PLEASE, pay a few more bucks and buy them somewhere else, I ordered two pairs from here on May 13, 2009. It is now June 3. In fact, it's almost June 4 and they just shipped them today. They have had my money for almost a month but I still don't have their product. If I had known it would take them a month to get the product to me I would have happily gone down the street and paid a few dollars more to actually have the product in hand. Do yourself a favor and don't lend these people your money, interest free for a month.Carhartt Double-Front Work Dungaree Pant - Men's"
2,Don't buy!!!,"Don't spend your hardened money on this. I bought this pair for hunting trips, but after to machine wash it start folling a part like a piece of the paper. There quality going down to the gator."
3,Too long,"Nice pair of pants but when compared to a pair of 30 x 30 carhartts that I currently own this new pair was 3"" longer."
2,Looks nice but does Not hold extra large mugs,I bought this because a review stating this mug tree holds large mugs nicely. I was very dissapointed to find that all the mugs clank against each other every time you place one on or take one off. My family uses mugs for everything from ice cream floats to coffee to cereal. I never thought these mugs were overly large. They are from Disney World and might hold 16 ounces. I was not pleased with this tree. I gave it to my sister for here smaller mugs. I will continue looking for a bigger tree.
1,Missing piece,"I recieved this item with a missing hook in the middle. I wouldn't have minded much if the piece had broke off during shipment, I probably would have tried to glue it together but the item was completely missing the piece."
1,"Arrived broken, tag not attached","It arrived with one of the metal ball ""feet"" broken off. The paper sleeve/tag that came with the product was ripped off and loose in the bag, leading me to believe it was previously returned."
1,"Despite the cover photo, it's Ashley-lite","Wow -- what happened between 'Hi, How Are You Today' and this CD? What a big change! From fast, rocking instrumentals (on the former CD) to songs where any instruments take a back seat to singing (on the latter). The first song on the CD starts off well, but then Ashley (?) starts singing...it's not that his voice is particularly bad, but the vocal tune just doesn't seem to go with the music the instruments are playing. As for the rest of the songs...well, I guess he did say he wanted to make a pop album. The vocals are the main focus -- vocals aren't what drew me to Ashley MacIsaac's music, and with this CD as an example, they won't keep me listening, either, unfortunately. They're not terrible, just...uninspired, I guess is the word."
4,"Presidor Wafer Rolls, Chocolate, 3,5-ounce Boxes pack of 24",these wafer rolls were very good if you like a very sweet taste.they would have gotten a rating of 5 if they were not so sweet.
5,This thing totally sucks...,"...and I mean that in a positive way. This item was purchased for use in servicing commercial electronic equipment. Works fine so far. Excellent quality hose, the best I've seen. Only question: What's with the photo of clog-like foot apparel? These 'accessories' were not included with my vac, which was, by the way, mercifully simply and economically packaged."
1,Stay away from Kaytee Foods,"I have owned two ferrets for 5 years now, only feeding them Zupreem, 8 in 1, and one other random food. I have always ensured that they only receive the best care and food and they have been very healthy. During one food refill, I picked up a 2.5lb bag of Kaytee, figuring that it looked tasty and any nutrition deficiencies in the food would have a minimal effect since it was mixed with over 10lbs of other food. Unfortunately, shortly after switching foods, both of my ferrets have been showing significant health problems. The vet was completely stumped and only after looking into the ingredients in the Kaytee food have we concluded that this is the cause of our woes. Please, for the health of your ferret, please stay away from Kaytee at all costs."
1,You'd be an idiot to believe all this crap.,"Eddie Mac is using this book to ""get back"" at people he doesn't like. He accuses people of rape...yet he has 2 rape arrests himself. He accuses people of being a pediphile and blames the ""system"" for his evil nature. The fact is, this guy is a pervert and a thug. He claims to get sexual gratification from breaking people's bones and even goes so far as to say he had a ""semi"" erection from breaking some guys knees. For starters, if you believe this crap he is selling, your a fool, secondly, Eddie Mac is a cowardly thug, typically talking trash about all these people he supposedly messed up and cowed, then talks about how he is now a ""cleaned up"" college grad who wants to help the neighborhood kids, the same ones he used to watch undress I guess. People this guy is a liar, the material is the same as watching a drunk bully in a bar tell stories about his old ""glory days"". Simply not worth the time or money."
4,Better then a book about LA gang members,After reading this you get a sence that these guys have more brains then LA gang memebers.Who are basically just playing the roll.Street soilder is exactly what he says he is.Solider in a street of reality.Ups and Downs from childhood to grownup.Much better then anything you can pick up on California gang culture.
1,MACKENZIE'S ACCOUNT DISMISSED AS SPURIOUS,"The author, a small-time criminal, is putting one over on the public as well a the writers who put together this spurious accont of the Bulger Era in Boston.If anyone is interested in this story, they should read BLACK MASS by two respected Boston reporters, ONEILL & LEHR who lived though period from 1965 to 1995 when four federal informants (Barbosa, Bulger, Martorano & Flemmi) murdered as many as 100 men & women in MA, FL, CA & OK.Also watch for forthcoming novelization by KEVIN DOYLE entitled THE INFORMANT - LIFE & TIMES OF WHITEY BULGER"
1,A self-serving book,"This lowlife legbreaker writes about the sexual pleasure he gets from breaking peoples legs, rats out other crooks to save his own criminal behind, and then tells us about how touched he is after going to college and finding out he's a good guy who loves his daughters. I felt disgusted with this guy who seemed top think the OTHER crooks were bad and he was good, after all he went to college. (so did Ted Bundy)I had read BLACK MASS earlier and liked it. Still curious about Whitey Bulger, I tried this book. It stunk. I could write about my disgust with this book (and I LOVE mob books) for days, but instead just send me your address and you can have my copy. This fool should not take anyone else's money."
4,Gritty read,"Eddie Mackenzie provides his readers with an enlightning look into the inner workings of the Boston Irish mob.His recounting of his experiences as muscle for mob leader Whitey Bulger make it difficult to put this book down.Reading about his life, I felt both sympathy and revulsion towards Mackenzie. When you see how messed up his childhood was, it's easy to understand why he became a criminal. But lots of people have had to contend with the miserable experiences he had and didn't become ""predators"" like him.Reading his story, I got a real vivid picture of the hopelessness and violence that plague Southie.I've never been there but feel like I have. Upon completing the book, I found myself admiring Mackenzie. He's clearly not proud of his days as a street thug but he's following a better path now."
3,Right in the middle on this one,"I'm right in the middle on this one and I'll tell you why; Well written and I'm interested in the subject matter. My problem with this one; it's a memoir, and in a memoir the narrative voice belongs to the keeper of the memories, so you can get a ghost writer to help you with the prose but the voice is going to be your own. I didn't like the guy with the voice.[...]J.R. Locke Author of Possible Twenty, a Gangster Tale"
2,Hard to believe.,"The writer seemed high on himself. I did not believe a lot of the things he said in the book. Some parts seemed to be based on fiction instead of reality. I didn't live this guys life so who knows, I could be wrong. For me I did not enjoy it. I am considering reading Kevin Weeks's story to see if they match up and if his is even mentioned in it."
4,ok but is it true,"the book will keep you interested,but is it true after reading Brutal and brother bulger and rat [...] you don't hear much about this guy so I can say this guys thinks he's bigger than who he is."
5,"INSIDER'S VIEW OF SOUTH BOSTON MOBSTER, WHITEY BULGER","Not asking for sympathy or forgiveness, Edward Mackenzie, a self acclaimed scumbag, tells everyone what it was like to work for Whitey Bulger. He uses graphic, bone crushing detail to portray the days when Whitey and his gang terrorized the streets of Boston. This book moves along quickly and offers a view unlike any I've read on the subject. It is not a researched, outsider's view - it's the real deal!"
2,Not Impressed,"Normally, I have been a huge proponent of Lego products, including their Software. Lego Loco, Lego Racers, Lego Stunt Rally, and Lego Alpha Team are all superb products. Lego Island 2 is slow to load, finiky in dealing with hardware and device drivers, and does not always make the controls obvious to the user. For something aimed at children and parents without time to debug and installation, this is not a good choice. I feel Lego should be more careful about licensing their name, as this is not up to their usually very high standards."
1,Resource Hog,"I have a P3 866MHz with 256MB Ram and this game choked the machine, nearly 800MB of disk space is required and the delay between levels is about 2 to 3 minutes. Several blue screen errors also resulting in a hard reboot. This game should be rated ""frustration for the entire family"". Also no on-line help but it does include a manual."
2,Stalled in setup,"My kids don't really play with it any more and it was a pain to get it to work on my 2 year old Pentium 300 computer, since it would stall out and the kids got frustrated so now it sits on the shelf while they play other computer games."
4,"OK Game, but...","This game has much better graphics and you have more freedom of movement than the original, but as for the gameplay, it is not something you want to play over and over again. While in the game, you have an objective at any given time, and whenever you talk to someone, they tell you your objective and point towards it. In other words, you really have to complete the objective unless you just want to go swimming or something. The freedoms and graphics may have not been that great in the original LEGO Island, but the gameplay is much better, and you can choose what missions you want to do when you feel like doing them. If you can, rent it or something and beat it in the 2 days it took me and then give it back, since I dont think it was worth the $... i paid for it."
1,To robelaine From South East Michigan,"I purchased Lego Island 2 for my daughter for Christmas, my computer didn't support the game either, so I attempted to return the game to Toys R Us and of course that was pointless, however I did call Lego Media myself and they told me to send them the game back to them with a note stating that the game was not compatible with my computer and the receipt, and they would send me a refund. The consumer affairs information is on their website, check it out!! You don't have to be stuck with a product you can't use."
1,Be careful!,"This CD-ROM CRASHED MY COMPUTER. (Permanently, I might add. Nobody has been able to find out why.) Be very careful when you install/run this program. You must have a super-fast highly able system. (My computer was only 18 months old, top of the line Dell.)When I called Lego Media to complain they tried to blame it on my computer, but admitted that the CD may be too complicated for most computers. This is deceiving since the system requirements on the label don't give any warnings that it not only might not work, but may damage your computer!"
2,What happened to Lego media?,"Lego has done better. Their newest releases seem to have abandoned the combination of fun and learning. This is a simple fun game with different arcade type activities no usefully skills involved, no puzzles, no long-term planning or management skills. If you can get hold of one for half price or less it might be worth it. My son chooses to play this maybe twice a month and otherwise it's collecting dust. I should not forget to mention that set up and getting starting involved plenty of tears, so do set it up yourself before getting the children excited about a new game."
3,"Works fine, but will it last?","Bought mine during the summer. Set up was easy and could not tell the difference between speed of my computers when hooked directly to the DSL modem or to the router. About 4 months after purchase the USB port went out. 2 hours on customer service and they still were not thinking it was the router so they sent an email to the next level of service. I was supposed to get an email from advanced support. 2 days later the error light came on and could not be cleared and all the ports stopped working. Emailed support and got a return authorization. Turn around time was about 3 weeks, was shipped back to me overnight UPS which surprised me."
2,Not Very Reliable,"My first Linksys BEFSRU31 DSL router failed in less than a year and I was able to get a replacement under warranty. The second one failed in about a year and a half. I'm now shopping for a router made by a company other than Linksys. I give it two stars instead of one because it realy is an easy-to-use router. But, if the darn thing keeps breaking down, who needs it?"
2,Great product!!!...while warranty lasts that is :(,"The product was working just great...until my warranty ran out that is. I bought the item back in August of the year 2001.. it didn't start malfunctioning 'til shortly before xmas of 2002. First the USB port went out and now I can't even communicate with the router and I can't even log on to the internet through the WAN port, I have to use the uplink port, but there is nothing I can do about it cuz...Warranty...expired!! I talked to Linksys and they said that I was pretty much on my own if I have no warranty and that they couldn't fix it if the warranty expired. There goes my money!... People.. don't waste your money on anything over $... I think I'm gonna purchase a cheap hub and link up that way rather than spend anymore money waiting for the warranty to expire before the thing goes out again!!"
3,Good Product - poor customer support,I had 2 of these go bad on me within a year. STILL waiting after 1 week to get the RMA to return the second one. It took me 2 phone calls and 5 e-mails to get that far! I'm starting to look at competitors products!
2,Lacking Important Tracks,"I bought this CD for one song. It was that long, beautiful song that played when Uma was examining the swords just after she arrives in Japan. Well, as you can guess, the song wasn't on the CD, and neither were a lot of other good ones. Don't bother with this."
5,Awesome!!!,"After watching vol.1, I got into an obsession ^__^;; I immediately bought this soundtrack and am in looooove with it! all the songs in the movie were perfect for the scenes and the songs themselves are really impressive! I've watched vol.2 but am still trying to find enough money to buy it U__U...for the question of where the flower of carnage is played...it's towards the end. right after The Bride kills O-ren (she goes and sits on that bench)."
5,song not on soundtrack,"anyone know where i can downlaod this song its not on the soundtrack i tried using kazaa but couldnt find itSeven Notes in BlackWritten by: Franco Bixie, Fabio Frizzi & Vince TemperaPerformed by: Vince Tempera & OrchestraThe scene with Buckif you know where to fing it could you please email me at massiveattack_187@yahoo.com thanx"
2,lots of filler.,"I expected full songs when I bought this, but found most the tracks are just excerpts. Instead of the full versions you get the same mini slices as on the movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie, and I enjoyed the sound track during the movie, but on its own its not worth it."
5,tarantino is insane,"basically tarantino is insane good sound track not even close to the movie itself this guy is out of his mind and it really amused me when some director comes with something like this, way to go tarantino too bad you want to retired from the movie industry you're one of a kind."
3,Looking for a certain song before I buy...,I really loved the background music from the scene where Uma is in the attic with the swords....is this song on the CD?
1,Buy Kill Bill Vol 2. Instead -empty except Song 1,"I am an avid music buyer and bought this cd as I already owned Kill Bill Vol 2 (excellent) and Pulp Fiction (good).Vol .1 was a super disappointment. Except Song 1 'Bang, Bang' by Nancy Sinatra the other songs are not even passable.Vol 2 on the other hand has excellent filler songs in addition to 3 or 4 top songs.KB Vol 1 is Completely Avoidable"
3,Eclectic,"The song selection here is icredibly vaired, from classic rock, to country/western--even Zamfir's flute makes an appearance. Having such a mized bag makes the CD a hit and miss prospect. I find myself skipping through most of the middle tracks--not a good sign. My favorite tracks are currently 1,2, and 9 (an odd bunch, if you've listened to the CD.)I always enjoy trarntino's choice of music to place in his movies. He has a knack for putting the right song in the right spot. If you enjoyed Kill Bill (and I did) you'll like the soundtrack. I voted in so-so, manly because i was hoping for a soundtrack playable all the way through with no filler, like the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. 'Tis my own high expectations that doom this CD."
4,Tarantino Serves Up Another Eclectic Mix,"I must say, if you got the soundtrack for all 4 of Tarantino films you would be quite happy. Another excellent soundtrack to surprise and blow away your friends with. I mean even the Zamfir (master of the pan flutes) song is cool! Enhanced Stuff - You will see some very brief scenes from vol 2 in trailer 3. Highly Recommended."
4,Missing Ennio Morricone!!!,"The soundtrack is great, but for one glaring ommission of the musical works of Ennio Morricone from the Spaghetti Westerns. For example, from the movie Death Rides a Horse... The track called ""Man to Man"" is missing... Oh well, perhaps they couldn't get Ennio's estate to allow its use on the soundtrack..."
3,"Great choice of music, but...","I rated this CD down because of the order of songs. I like to visualize the movie as the songs play. Many of the songs are in a different order than in the film. It makes for a very disjointed listening experience. Vol. 2 is even worse. The variety of music was awe inspiring; not my first choice for the scene, but it worked...always! But, by putting songs out of order,, it interrupted the flow of the images of the film. Please stop doing that."
5,Tarantino's best film AND soundtrack to date !!!,"Tarantino is a master filmmaker and his soundtracks are dead on target with the plot of the films they accompany.Just as Pulp Fiction had the exact right selections on the soundtrack to match the mood of the storyline and characters, so does Kill Bill Vol. 1. With selections like ""Bang Bang"" from Nancy Sinatra and ""The Lonely Shepherd"" by pan flute master Gheorghe Zamfir all in the same score, Tarantino makes every piece of the puzzle of his films fit together with perfect harmony to deliver a powerful experience.Only for those who have seen the film and enjoyed both it and the music, this soundtrack does not disappoint."
4,Love it!,"This soundtrack is everything I hoped it to be. If you love Kill Bill, you have to own the soundtrack as well."
3,Marketed chic,"3 1/2Even if this is perhaps the most diverse ranging soundtrack put together from a Tarantino film yet, there is simply too much effort going into track selections, feeling less inspired and more calculated then previous compilations despite length and worldliness working in favor of the theme."
4,Where's that song?,"I enjoyed this soundtrack, except for the fact that it was missing the music played in the scene from the movie just before The Bride cuts off the arm of Sophie Fatal. Other than that, pretty cool."
4,Exelently Done,"One of the best things about the movie was the soundtrack Overall its pretty solid and is a great blend of diffrent types of music, but the one song im looking for in particular is the song they played just as uma and lucy lu where begining to go at it, at the end of the movie,if you know the name of this song and if its on the soundtrack please respond thank you"
3,"Many decnet tracks, but some are lacking","This soundtrack has a few good songs on it, I got it just for the whistle one (so I can learn the whistle) and ""Woo Hoo"", the one the japanses chicks sing in the club. Some of the older songs that are on the Cd are good (I love the Issac hayes one), but a few just plain suck (especially the one with RZA talking over it). Good to buy if you really like some of the songs from the moive, but dont be looking for anything more than that."
5,Excellent Song Selection,"The person that wrote the review above was incorrect. The song that plays when Uma picks the sword IS on the cd, and it's ""The lonely shephard"" by Gheorghe Zamfir - Romanian folk music (Zamfir is very famous for playing the panflute). Some of the other songs are very energetic. Very good ensemble."
4,movie soundtrack,The music is a good mix of stuff from the film. The rap stuff was lame. I skip over the parts that are annnoying.
3,"Good CD, lots omitted.","This soundtrack is both really amazing and really disappointing. There are enough songs on it to make it worthwhile, however:1. There are probably about 20 minutes (3-6 songs) that are left off that are in the movie. They're all really cool songs too.2. Instead you get a bunch of little shorts and sound effects. okay, maybe thats cool, but does it belong on a soundtrack??? (eg. a 10-second track of ""axe throw"")3. So all in all, you get about 30 minutes of good music. So buy the CD cheap."
5,One MotherF$$$in-Tastic Soundtrack..ask that Vlad,"This soundtrack blows any other previous Tarantino based soundtrack out of the water.Just the quality and variances in the types of music chosen is phenomenal.I'm opened up to new explorations into my musical atmosphere.The 5/6/7/8's are one of these groups, I must now explore based on their addage to this soundtrack.I was sitting in that darkened movie theatre out in Farmingdale watching, what has to be the best Tarantino send-up since Pulp Fiction.I was glued to my seat and could of actually spent the rest of the evening watching the last half of the Kill Bill.The choice of old Ironside music was also another plus."
3,"Can't play on PC, even though you own it...","Great content, but you can't play it on your PC. Copy protection prevents this from being played on anything but plain old CD player. Seems pretty lame... It'd be nice to have that on the label.Don't buy it unless your OK with the CP...Regards"
2,Best song is missing,"I loved the song played when the bride cuts off sophie's arm. This song is not on the cd ,however. And nobody seems to know what its name is. So if you do please post. As for the others on the CD - they are pretty good, give the general feel of the movie. Its an eclectic collection."
4,super,"for some reason on this disk there is no song, which sounds after battle from Oren, and song, with which concludes the film. They the best, but for some reason here there are not."
2,"The movie is great, but this is poor...","After watching the two movies and buying them on DVD, i figured i'll get the soundtrack from the movie. However, many of the songs on the album are not the ones in the film, and some are not songs at all, just sound effects from the fighting scenes! The fantastic track at the end of the film which plays during the fight between The Bride and Oren isn't even on the Cd, that was a real mistake. Don't bother forking out your bucks for this, theres no point!"
5,Cool,This is a supercool soundtrack. Quinton Tarantino is so good at choosing the right music to enhance his films. One of his best so far. It almost tops Pulp Fiction. I wonder if Kill Bill II can live up to this one?
5,Uncredited Song,"I don't have to say much, as everyone else has already said, this is a great album. Tarentino has always had a great ear for soundtracks.I wanted to mention a great song though that is used in the movie but not on the soundtrack or listed in previous reviews.""I need more love"" by Robert Randolph and the Family Band.Part of this song plays in the scene when the Bride faces Oren Ishi for their final battle, very upbeat, disco like with wailing guitar and syncopated clapping. It makes for a great scene and it's a great song."
4,"Worth the $$$, Tarantino soundtrack as expected","I knew what I was getting into when I bought this. I knew some of the music may not exactly fit into the genres I like...but I've got an open mind. The ""whistle"" tune is here, and several others you'll recognize, plus some soundbites from the movie.It's a good cd, but it's even better once you go to www.killbill2.net and download the songs that aren't on the album, then you will be complete."
2,Not Disney's Scarecrow,"I was a fan of the Disney series as a child, and in preparation for a business trip to the southern coast of Britain, I read the Kindle edition of the book. (Which was complete, unlike, evidently, some of the paper versions reviewed here.) It is darker than the Disney version, and Syn is often quite violent here. That's fine, and I'm not surprised that Disney cleaned up the character a bit. But the prose is rather weak, and instead of exploring the smuggling, the author often went off on several unimportant tangents and curious subplots.I made the mistake of reading reviews before I had finished the novel. No thanks to reviewer Thomas Moody for giving away the ending!"
3,A Good Smuggler Always Has A Plan B,"Doctor Syn -- quite a name for the unassuming, fatherly, and mild-mannered vicar in the quiet English village of Dymchurch. But of course there's more than meets the eye to the vicar, and the name ""Syn"" gives the readers a clue that maybe the vicar has had something of a checkered past ...Russell Thorndyke's book is filled with an amusing cast of characters, especially Mipps, the irrepressible sexton; Jerry Jerk, the clever young man with a taste for the macabre; and of course, Dr Syn himself, the man who always keeps an ace up his sleeve, and knows where the hidden exits are. It was a pleasure to read about a man still crafty enough in his waning years to match wits with the authorities sent to stamp out smuggling, and I recommend this book for anyone who enjoyed Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" or DuMaurier's ""Jamaica Inn."""
3,Not very tender,"I'm a real fan of most Jack Link's products. I especially like their peppered steak nuggets. These, unfortunately, are not that great. Maybe I just got an older batch, but when the title is 'tender' I expect them to be at least as tender as the nuggets I love so much. Sadly, these were pretty hard, maybe even harder than the nugget variety. I'll stick to nuggets in the future."
2,Too salty!,I bought the beef jerky based on the reviews that I read but I don't think I saw anyone mention how salty the beef strip is. It tastes great and all but I felt like I was eating spoons full of salt! I wouldn't recommend this unless they have one that has at least 50% less salt content.
1,Salt and MSG sticks,"If you love meat-like chewable salt sticks, then this is the choice for you. Salt should be listed as the first ingredient, MSG second, spices third, then beef.Sometimes you have to wonder why the execs don't eat their own (dog) food. This particular product should have never made it to market without a fair-warning stamp on the bag saying: ""Now Loaded with Salt!"" What kind of Prime Rib has ever been prepared with this amount of overpowering saltiness?"
3,Small Serving,They're good - but there's only a handful of sticks per 3.5 oz. bag. Would be great if Amazon offered larger size or bulk option. There's a lot of excess packaging for the actual product you receive.
2,GOOD PRODUCT\POOR DELIVERY PERFORMANCE,"PRODUCT NO LONGER AVAILABLE IN LOCAL WALMART IS DAY TIME SNACK OF CHOICE BY WIFE. THE ORDER OPTIONS WERE PACKAGES OF 6, SO WE ORDERED X2 OR ONE DOZEN. RECEIVED 2 ORDERS SHIPPED INDEPENDENTLY IN BOXES BIG ENOUGH FOR 30 PACKAGES EACH AND PAID SHIPPING X2. PACKAGES ARRIVED TOGETHER."
3,Pink Motel,"A collection of short stories that take place in a sleazy, roadside no tell motel, run by Phyllis Diller and Slim Pickens who are great. It reminds us of those colorful motels that lined our streets once upon a time, but are now being replaced with high rises, etc. Spicey but would probably get a PG-13 rating at most by today's standards. Not necessarily a classic but would not take up space on a cult film collector's shelf either."
4,"Proved its usefulness in the field, summer 2002",".If we had relied solely on our standby Scotland Blue Guide this August, we would have had a very difficult time. IN retrospect, we could have dispensed with the Blue Guide, and soloed with the Rough Guide. Rough Guide's Highland volume provided us with a basic reality check early on: we would not be able to see as much as we wanted, and would have to make trade offs. Rough Guide made those trade offs far easier. In each geographically based section, they provided a list of the area's key points to hit. (Blue Guide has a hierarchy also, but it's not nearly so easy to tap into.) And while some of Rough Guide's advice on accommodations and restaurants may go out of date, it was nice to have that information (Blue Guide chooses not to cover these aspects).We knew little or nothing about the Highlands a few weeks ago... Rough Guide helped us have a very good time."
2,How to get there?,"This book was thorough, but strangely unhelpful. Many regions/towns are listed, but with no depth. Each entry tells geography, and interesting things to see, but no idea of how to get there, where to stay. The main advice for each town: call the travel office. There are no recommendations for the ""must see"" vs. not that interesting. If I had a teleporter and knew I wanted to see Loch Ness, this would be useful book. Otherwise, it is not helpful for planning a trip to the Highlands. And I can't imagine taking it with me when I go."
5,Very Useful,I used an earlier edition of this guide three years ago on a trip to the Orkneys and found it very useful then. Now I am using it to plan a trip to the Outer Hebrides next summer.
3,Twenty fourth in the St. Germain series.,"Or ninteenth, if you don't count the spinoff series featuring Olivia and Madeline, two vampiric ""offspring"" of St. Germaine.The character of St. Germaine is as delightful as ever, but in this book the plot was a little slow. There was very little actual action, and an unfortunate amount of political manuvering. In that regard, it was somewhat reminiscent of the ""Olivia"" spinoffs; we see very little of the vampiric powers of St. Germain. Still, the book was not unenjoyable, and if there was somewhat less eroticism than there has been in other St. Germain books, what there was was very well done. And of course, the historical setting, in the late Roman period, was very well-researched."
2,Not the best historial fiction,"I bought this book because I love historical fiction and love to read about ancient Rome. This was just not a good read. The conversations the characters have with each other take five to six paragraphs to get to the point (one even went on for two pages before the one character asked the question he had to ask). There are several letters, pretty much one every chapter, which gets alittle annoying as they are from different people but all have the same tone. No one does correspondence better than Colleen McCullough; when she writes for Pompey you can practically hear him talking. I'm not much into the vampire thing, but I thought this would be interesting because the main character has been un-dead for I believe two thousand years, and finding him in Roman times seemed like it would be entertaining. But the author never tells about him ""feeding"", and other vampire-like things. Guess I'll stick to straight historical fiction from now on."
4,delivery,"loved the chest, better than I thought. problem was with delvery. was charged an unbelievable fee, delivery man left it in the doorway in the box, my husband and I are not young, very difficult to get out of box, I still have to wait for my children to visit to put the legs on."
3,A little chip on marble top,"It is a seriously heavy chest, or foyer console. Wood area is nicely crafted, the box protection is not very good.The wave shaped front of the marble chip off a bit, I didn't border to report to Amazon as it is hard to argue who did it.Packaging is typical ""China"", too much useles styroform which is of course completely mashed. Unpacking is a horrible mess if any lady should be handling that. If anyone don't want to spend an hour cleaning up this is not the chest to buy.Instructions are not good at all. Just a few printer-copy pages.Without the legs, the chest seems more balanced. After mounting the legs, it is not balanced at all. And one would seriously doubt how strong the legs can withstand the weight, if no one sttempt to sit on the chest or lean on it, it may be ok."
1,Poor usability - stay with 2000,"I was looking for a helpful upgrade and instead got perhaps the most user unfriendly software I have used in a long, long time. I am a software tester by profession and would have failed this product on poor usability. Stay with the previous version."
5,MS Publisher 2002,"This product was very price-worthy, was easy to install, and has performed perfectly since I bought it. It is doing exactly what I hoped, and more. The product itself was in excellent condition."
5,What A Upgrade,"I always thought that Publisher 2000 was easy to use. This upgrade is even easier. Even someone who has never used Publisher before can make outstanding postcards, flyers,newsletters, and publications. What a EXCELLENT Product!"
1,Don't do it.,"I use Publisher for little family web sites on geocities. Pub 97 was really good. When 2000 came out I bought it and it was GREAT! The best program I've ever used in fact! So naturally when MS Publisher 2002 came out I bought it and my heart is broken. It has ruined all my work and will not upload to my host. It is a land-mine of bad news. It even crashes my cable access to the net. But to give you and example. When you finish you website and go to save it, it says to go to file and Save as a Web Page (97 and 2000 does this too) BUT GUESS WHAT?::: There is nothing there about saving to web page. HELP which used to be really ""helpful"" dances around it with NO INFO. I am convinced that Microsoft does not want this program used for web work anymore because of lagging sales of Front Page, and set it up to fail. I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING. I HAVE BEEN BUILDING WEB PAGES FOR 6 YEARS WITH EASE, BUT THIS PROGRAM HAS RUINED EVERYTHING AND MADE IT A LIVING HELL."
3,"GOOD, BUT NO MAJOR IMPROVEMENT OVER THE 2000 VERSION","One of the biggest sins Microsoft committed with her Office XP Application Suite is removing the Publisher from its Professional edition without lowering the price. (The Professional edition of Office 2000 has Publisher, in addition to all other Applications present in XP Professional). But that apart, I must say that this Publisher 2002 works fine. It is fast, very easy to customize, and yields high quality Desktop Publishing outputs. Still, a close scrutiny revealed that its 'improvements' over the 2000 edition is only marginal. The difference between the two is mainly on the interface. Hence, I regard this 2002 edition as a great value for anyone upgrading a 9X version; but not for the 2000 one."
3,Amazon does not support its customers' purchases,"This Microsoft product may be fine. But I do not recommend buying it through Amazon.com. The seller, softmall.com, is totally unresponsive to e-mail queries. When I asked to have my order cancelled, I got no reponse from them. And Amazon.com was unwilling to help resolve the issue. It has been 6 week, and I have not received the product, nor have I received a refund."
2,Very limited,"My goodness, you would think a $10 billion company could do better than this.They talk about double sided printing...You CANNOT even ""print even"" or ""print odd"" pages. You have to sit in front of your computer and print EACH and EVERY page manually.You cannot print to an image file (well, yes you can, but the low resolution makes the file unusable)You cannot print to a PDFPrinting to a post script file cut off half the image on one of the projects!This product assumes your printing service uses Publisher.Guess what... most don'tDavid"
4,Not my favorite of David Benoit,It is tough to find which CDs of David Benoit that I want to use with massage. Some have too fast of a paceand this as I recall was not suitable as background music. It is still good easy listening music.
3,Who's the target audience?,"This book is decent, but there doesn't seem to be a target audience that allows the book to be more cohesive. I generally found that the author went far into depth about things that I (a personal linux user as opposed to a network admin) did not care about, and only skimmed the surface of items that I found truely interesting and relevant. Moreover, the audience seems to range from someone who has never touched a keyboard (I read an explination of what he backspace key does, last night), to budding admins."
2,Get the 4th ed.,So in this edition they decided to take out all the helpful info that was in the fourth and replace it with advertisements for linux features. I think most people who have a book like this want detailed descriptions of underlying components in linux. Not ads for applications that will be outdated in a few months.
5,Great movie,Love a great movie. Heart warming. Why does a review have to be so long? Someone needs to change that:)
3,Reminds us what we owe the military,This shows a young man who is able to give his family what they need to survive by God's grace.
5,Christmas Visitor,"The Christmas Visitor is emotionally and spiritually packed, if you believe in miracles. Great film."
5,A Christmas Visitor,"This DVD was recommended to me by a friend of mine and I just loved it!! It is a real tear jerker and a definite film for the holidays and all year round!! It is how families are torn apart by a tragedy and then pulled together with the ""spirit"" of the crisis!! A truly must have DVD!"
4,A Christmas Visitor,This movie is a classic. Such an inspiration for me. I ordered it for a couple of friends to inspire them also.
3,Ending lacked,"I thought that the movie had a lot of potential, but lacked a lot at the end. There was so much build up in the film about their son, and then it sort of fades away and...well, lets just say that it was quite disapointing near and at the end of the film. I think it could have been something very special, but having only the father understanding who the visitor really is, really takes away from the whole story."
2,"Not ""The Christmas Card"" by a long shot.","I bought this after ""A Christmas Card"" thinking from the reviews it would be in the same vein, but that was not the case. I am not too fond of the actor & actress anyway,so started with a lowered opinion. I also am not into the super-naturial so the film just fell apart for me at about the middle. IT could have been salvaged at the end by having the soldier be one of the wounded from the sons unit, but didn't happen so ruined it for me. I know this is out of step with most reviews, but we all have different likes & dislikes."
5,Great movie,I would recommend this movie to every one. A very family oriented movie. And a great holiday movie to spend with family.
4,Great show,Great show a little slow in areas but a joy to watch. What a touching story and cast. It puts you in the christmas spirit.
5,love it,"we loved the christmas visitor, a fantastic movie, very moving, excellent, every family should see this movie, especially around christmas. guaranteed to enjoy it!"
5,A Christmas favorite of mine.,"This story is rebroadcast every Christmas time on Hallmark. But I liked it enough to buy, so I can watch it at my convenience each year. I won't give away the story; it just makes you feel good, and you'll probably have a few tears clouding the TV screen at the ending. Good acting, good message. If you love Christmas, this story will make it even better. William Devane does a great job, as usual."
4,A Christmas Visitor,Wonderful family inspirational movie. Very touching especially for families with someone in the service. I really enjoyed it and watched it three times already.
1,"Love the movie but this one was defective, waiting to see replacement","Will change the rating if the exchange is better but this DVD was defective. It would only play, not go back or forward in the movie. It just froze."
2,not great,"I thought it was kind of a weird storyline. I watched it with my daughter and she felt the same way. Some of the characters were just unlikeable to me and it wasn't as upbeat as you would hope a Christmas movie would be. It definitely left us with an unsettled feeling. I'm sure others may enjoy this kind of movie, it just wasn't for us."
5,An Inspirational Movie,"This film which combines love of family, love of country, love of neighbor, and love of God is very comforting and inspirational. The stranger picked up at the side of the road lends an air of mystery and wonder to the film. Most enjoyable!"
3,Mostly bizarre,"This is the author's reportedly largely fictional autobiography as an urban black South African musician and ""criminal"" living up in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. It's chaotic but colorful, detailed but also unreliable in any particular point of fact about the actual life of the writer. So it's a sort of fantasy, for better or worse, about the lives of urban black South Africans of the time. For what was really true about those times, I think authentic autobiographies are actually more moving.As a work of art, well, it's not quite up to that, either."
2,Misleading Title!,"As the only other reviewer stated, if you are looking for informaiton on Chassis and Suspenion (what different set-ups there are, how to set-up or design a chassis and suspension, how to ANYTHING) this book is not for you. It is a rehash of Four Wheeler Magazine Articles. The articles themselves are interesting, but I'm sure you could find them all online. Little to no practical knowledge is provided. And the 10 tips they do provide are useful, but they are simple dos and don't, no background information, no don't do this, but if you do, make sure you also do this and this. Overall, I'm glad I got this book for cheap."
2,"No theory, just how to install after marked lift kits.","If you are looking for some basic input about 4x4 suspension, this is the wrong book for you. On the other hand, if you got an american buildt truck and want to make it look better, you can probably get some nice info from this book. Self builders, stay clear!"
2,SANJULIAN DESERVES BETTER,"I'm a long time fan of Sanjulian's work from back in the seventies when he was doing covers for Warren Publishing. I thought I would never see his work again until I learned about the existance of his art book. Excited, I ordered it right away. Imagine my disappointment when I received a seventy page book with only eight pages of color! The luminosity of his color is part of what makes his work incredible. All of it wasted on page after page of black and white reproductions. Sanjulian deserves better, and so do his admirers."
1,Not that James Clary,"You refer to me in your book as a sports author who wrote a book on the Minnesota Twins, etc. I am not that James G. Clary. I did, however, write The Last True Story of Titanic, which is 99% fact with known superstitious anecdotes. I would appreciate your making these corrections."
2,Just an okay album.,"I have all Faith Hill's albums and would rate this as okay. If you are a casual listener, don't buy this album - buy Cry instead. Fireflies is rather soft and mushy. It's like a bunch of Mommy songs. I'm sure Faith loves it since she's at that point in her life but it didn't appeal to me at all. The songs don't grab you. It's still a country/pop sound which I like but I was disappointed overall (especially since Cry and Breathe were so much better and stronger). The best song on Fireflies is ""Dearly Beloved"" which is a funny, twangy song ala Brad Paisley but the rest of the songs are forgettable."
2,Not Very Good,"Sorry just not very good for me. I like faith hill, but this isnt her best. All songs are very bland."
3,If you like Fireflies?,Faith Hill does a pretty good job of covering Lori McKenna's Fireflies and Steeling Kisses. But to hear the original from Lori gives you goosebumps. She has so much emotion in her music.
2,"Blah. Dull. Uneventful. Retreads of everything she's done before, except worse","From yet another duet with Tim about how in love they are, to attempts to re-countrify herself back to Wild Ones, this album is a stinker.I resisted when she moved towards pop, however, each of her more poppy albums, had at least one or two songs that were innovative, if nothing else - ""Cry,"" ""Breathe.""This album has no standouts, for me. Already listed back on amazon!"
2,Smart for Faith to pick Lori McKenna,"By far the best songs on this albumn are the ones written by Lori McKenna. Faith Hill has definitely chosen amazing songs to cover, particularly the title track Fireflies. However, I'm underwhelmed by some of the other songs. I might just listen to Ms. McKenna's albums Bittertown and Pieces of Me from now on - she has amazing grit and soul."
4,Fireflies Review,I have listened to Faith for a good number and years and have heard a great quantity of her music. Fireflies is a great album which displaies Faith's outstanding vocal talent! It has amazing songs written by Lori McKenna which Faith sings beautifully. Fireflies contains a wide range of song styles (slower love songs all the way to fun summer songs). I definately recommend Fireflies to anyone who has a passion for music.
1,ONE OF THE WORST SITES TO ORDER CD's (HiFreMusic),"AWFUL SERVICE! People this site has a 4.9 out of 5 star rating which it doesn't deserve. ALWAYS read the feedback because they should'nt have a 5 star rating! GOOD GRIEF! READ MY FIRST REVIEW BEFORE BUYING CD""S FROM THIS SITE!"
1,"I have lost my ""Faith""","Boring, trite, and just because you throw in some dobro..its still not country...Faith is an annoying, overrated artist whose best work was her early work, pre-""Breathe""..."
4,Great New Album,"I ordered the special Autographed edition, and this cd is great. I have been a fan for a long time, and Faith seems to be on an every other cd is amazing. I just love ""Like We Never Loved Before"" which she sings with hubby Tim. (I am a tim fan too) I think that this album is very country - almost feels a little bit of the Yea-Haw country that we are seeing now. I am a little sad with the brown hair hippie look, it just seems like she is trying to be something doesn't need to be. But, it is a great album. You will be happy you bought it!What concerned me ... why did she lower the price so much? Some of her older albums still cost more. Just seemed weird to me."
4,"A little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll","I've been a Faith Hill fan for years, so I always look forward to a new release. Fireflies has some of the country-twang staples that have endeared us to her for so long, but being the crossover star she is this album also heads into some light rock territory. Not my favorite Faith effort, but a good solid album overall."
5,My first Faith Hil CD and very impressive it is...,"The Amazon review says this CD is ""schizophrenic""... that is balderdash. Ms. Hill appears to me to be showing an expansive range; from the funny and so true ""Dearly Beloved"", to the outstanding Lori McKenna songs, to the beautiful and complex ""Paris"".... this CD is one of the few I have bought that had me playing it three times in a row as soon as I got it.Congratulations, Ms. Hill... you have a new fan.- A classical music lover"
2,Fireflies,"I have to admit that I am pretty disappointed in this CD. I waited for three years and multiple delays. When I saw Faith in Vegas in August 2004 she said the CD would be out Fall of 2004. Anyway, I could not believe the first track Sunshine &Summertime it was just fluff along with Fireflies, We've got nothing to prove and the Lucky One. These should have never made it on the CD, Faith is so much better then this lame material. I also felt there was not even one song that really struck me like in her previous Cd's, like Breathe, This Kiss and most of Cry. This CD is a very poor attempt at getting on country radio and this hurts me to say as I really like Faith Hill but save your money, Fireflies is not worth it."
4,A good but confused effort for Faith,"Being a die hard fan of Faith, I could never be disappointed in any of her cds but Fireflies jumps around so much it lacks a true focus. She tries too hard to please her country fans on the silly ""Dearly Beloved"" and her sincerity sounds forced on ""Mississippi Girl."" She shines when she stops trying to please others on tracks like the beautiful ""Stealing Kisses"" or ""I Want You."" Other tracks like ""Paris"" and ""Wish for You"" are fantastic but they are painfully out of place on this disc. My approach to this disc would be to try to appreciate each song individually because they sound awkward together. Overall, I recommend the cd and most of her previous fans will enjoy it."
1,Cross-over diva?,"Maybe I'm a little crazy but her songs just aren't like they used to be. I think her new hit single, what really bugs me is that Mississippi Girl is about her and she grew up in Mississippi and yet she films the video in CA! I have every other CD of hers but after listening to this one I will not buy, I think she is a sell out and I am deeply disappointed with this latest album."
1,"Screams, ""Country Audience, Please Take Me Back""","Faith Hill has a great voice, that we can not deny. However, your preference at just how she uses her voice is a matter of opinion, OBVIOUSLY! I prefer the main stream Faith, OBVIOUSLY! On her last effort, ""Cry"" her talent is spotlighted where as this new CD ""Fireflies"" screams of a country girl who's asking to be forgiven from a country audience that scorned her (and her husband) for the cross-over steps she made that made Faith a sex symbol and household name. This entire CD is pure country. Whiny, cheesy, simple-minded and light-hearted which is exactly what most country music prides itself on. The best song on this CD is the last one, ""Paris"", which is a beautiful ballad that presents Faith as she should truly be. She has an amazing voice, beauty and presence . . . why waste it on this music. Most of your reviews read ""Faith's back!"", well if this is what she's putting out there from here on out, you can have her back. Good riddance!"
3,Not Her Best,"I am a fan of Faiths & love her voice, have a few of her CD's.Her albums have been outstanding to very good but I was disapointed with this new one, In fact bored to the point of falling a sleep in the car. This work has a couple good songs but that it. Wish it was better."
2,Blah...Blah...Blah,"I have been a Faith Hill fan for quite some time. Honestly, I felt cheated by this album. All the hype has been that ""Faith is returning to her country roots"" with this album. Especially, by releasing ""Mississippi Girl"" as the first single, I really believed that it was the sign of good things to come for Faith again. However, I was sadly disappointed by this album.The first three songs are actually quite good and really have that country feel to it. I especially liked ""Dearly Beloved"". It has a nice fun sound to it and is truly different. However, from that point on, the album just fizzles and seems to get worse and worse. The last four or five songs all sound the same. The chorus on ""we've got nothing but love to prove"" is the most god awful chorus I've ever heard and really just laughable. And ""Paris"" was just awful! So boring...Please don't fall into the trap (that I did) of wasting your money on this album. It's just not worth it!!"
1,Returning to Her Roots? HAHA!,"I found the claim that this album is Faith Hill's way of returning to her country roots laughable. She's not country by a long shot (but, honestly... who in Nashville is?). Commercial country's trends are beginning to gravitate more towards country than pop (even still, almost all popular country music nowdays sucks), so she's just following the trends. No surprise there. What's sad is that no matter what, I'm sure this CD will probably go at least platinum because crap sells and real music doesn't."
1,Awful CD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Being a die hard Faith Hill fan I am extremly dissappointed in this cd. Except for Faith and Tim's duet I think all the rest of the songs on the album, well.............suck. I have listened to this cd over and over and the more I hear it the worse it gets. This would be one of the first time's I would like a refund.Shane"
2,What happend?,"Returning from her unsuccessful pop album Cry, Faith returns to her country roots with Fireflies. What a disappointment. I waited 3 years for this album and all I get are slow and sappy ballads. Sunshine and Summertime, Mississippi Girl, and Dearly Beloved serve as a strong start to the album. They are fun, upbeat, and have a catch rhythm. After that, the album progresses slowly. Besides The Lucky One, all of the songs are slow and drawn out. The only thing good about these songs are that they display Faith's powerful and pliable voice. Like We Never Loved At All is the only song with meaning and emotion. Owning all of her albums, I would have to say this is her worst effort. I recommend this album for die-hard Faith fans. If you're not, save your money."
2,Don't waste your money,There's not one original theme or memorable tune on this whole album. The music is uniformly bland and the lyrics unimaginative and unoriginal. Overall a very disappointing endeavor; I hoped for so much more and I know she's capable of it.
1,Fireflies Disappoints,Apart from the 1st 3 tracks this is a very poor album. To wait 3 years to put this out is a disgrace.It is full of one paced dull ballads which if you want to be put to sleep is fine.Take my advice and save you cash
4,Faith is Back!,"If you love Faith Hill you will like this cd. With fun upbeat tunes like ""Mississippi Girl"" and ""sunshine and summertime"" and also ballads like ""ain't gonna take it anymore"" and ""Like we never loved at all"" this cd has a little bit of everything. Faith sounds a little more country on this album than she did on her last and its a welcome return."
3,Fireflies,"Starting with the first track Faith lets the listener know that she is coming home to her country roots. She isn't going to please everyone every time, yet she is trying to do what she does best, pick the music that reflects her life at the time of the CD recording. After being accused of ""going Hollywood"" with her last release ""Cry"" and appearing in ""The Stepford Wives"", it appears Faith Hill decided to come back to the genre that has made her famous and given her a home. With songs written by The Warren Brothers, John Rich and Lori McKenna, Faith gives it her all and hopes to satisfy at least some of her critics."
2,"A Few Decent Hits, But An Overall Disappointment","Critics applaud Faith for singing country songs on this release, rather than screaming Adult-Contemporary pop tunes of the past two albums. I agree that Faith is headed in the right direction, but the material here is weak. She had two years to come up with better songs than these. ""Mississippi Girl"" is catchy, and the obligatory duet with her husband is destined to be overplayed on the radio, but the rest of the album has very few uptempo tunes, which I think are Faith's strenghs. I'm glad I only paid $9.99 for this one."
3,Not my favorite but good to hear her again,I have listened to Faith Hill since the very first album years ago.This is my least favorite.I still think she has a great voice but I am a bit disappointed.Regardless-she continues to try and give us what we want to hear.
5,Awesome!,"I have always loved Faith Hill this is another great CD. I especially love the song ""Fireflies""."
3,"Getting there, but still a ways to go!","I LOVE Faith Hill. I have loved her from the beginning and was really disappointed in her last album ""Cry"". She has such a beautiful, soulful voice, and usually picks good songs to showcase this. I think she only got it about half right this time.Like several other reviewers, I think the song with Tim McGraw ""Like We Never Loved At All"" is fantastic. Not because of the hype of her and Tim, just because it's a good song and they both sang it very well.There are a few songs on this CD that sound like a bad easy listening radio station, not just because they're slow in tempo but because they are simple and repetitive. Several of them sound the same. Also, the title track ""Fireflies"" and ""Wish For You"" are too much of a lullaby to hold my attention.Overall, I think Faith is on the right track with this CD, but she still has a little way to go to truly get back to her highly successful career. I'm glad to see her headed the right direction though!"
4,Faith is Back!,"I've been a Faith fan for years; she introduced me to Country Music. While the big talk with this album is that she is back to her country side, she is, and always will be Faith. She sings what she wants to sing, and sounds beautiful no matter what. A true Faith fan will love this album and all it has to offer, and she also will gain new fans by her return to country, and wonderful ballads. Just listen to a track, and you will be caught in the magic of ""Fireflies."" ~cindi09"
5,Awesome album!!!! Her best yet!!!!!!,"What can I say? This is the best album Faith has put out!! I have been a fan since ""Take Me As I Am"" and I think Faith has outdone herself this time!!!!!!! There is not a song on this album I dislike. To be honest, the first time I heard the live version of ""Paris"" I was not sold on it, but the album version is just beautiful. I love the rawness in Faith's voice. ""Dearly Beloved"" is one of the funniest songs I have ever heard. ""Wish For You"" gives me chills. Its just a great and relaxing song!! I really love ""Like We Never Loved At All."" Its emotional, and such a great song. Tim does a great job on the background vocals. I am such a fan of Faith's that I joined her i-squad as a way to support her. My username on there is FaithNTimRock. Originally, isn't it?"
5,Faith,Love this CD..I am glad Faith is back. Amazon is the best ...great products and fabulous service and selection.
4,Very Good Album,"""Fireflies"" is really Faith Hill's return to country music. The first four tracks are more country than the rest of the album, but each one is catchy and makes you tap your foot.The title track ""Fireflies"" and ""Wish For You"" are the two stand outs on ths CD. Both are very well sung by Ms. Hill and have me pressing repeat everytime I hear them.We also get to hear her husband in ""Like We Never Loved At All."" Still waiting on that duet CD.....Overall, FIREFLIES is a much better effort than CRY. Still not as good as ""Take Me As I Am"" or ""It Matters to Me,"" but worth the money."
1,Fireflies,"I was extremely disappointed by this new album. The only song, in my opinion that was any worth, was the one sung with her husband - Like We Never Loved Before. I felt as if she were trying to apologize to folks for doing ""cross-over"" music that became popular with a larger audience than just country. She has an amazing voice and I just don't think she put any effort into this album."
2,Gets old really fast,"The verdict is finally out on this album. It's been swallowed, and the aftertaste is not very good. I agree with most that the album starts off strong, and the first three songs are cute, but cute is not going to make me listen to this album for years to come, like all of her previous albums. I recently read a review in the Washington Post that said that Shania tries too hard, and that Faith does it just right. I couldn't disagree more. Coming out and trying to be a Mississippi girl after all she's been through is a joke, and nobody is going to buy that. Bottom line, wait for the video. Whoops, there is no video! The radio will suffice. Or, do what I do, and subscribe to Rhapsody music. Cheers. P.S. If you didn't find my review helpful, you can suck my big one. (...)"
1,Faith- You Bombed,"I too was a HUGE Faith Hill fan and loved her to death. I have every one of her albums and have to say this is the most disappointing album I have ever bought. Faith took country to the big city and made it mainstream. She became a cover girl, movie star, a high class chic. Trying to sell me on Mississippi Girl is a laugh. Her dancing in torn jeans, a shirt trying to say she's still the same old girl and trying to imitate every Gretchen Wilson move is embarrassing. I might be convinced if she were not living in her California mansion, jet setting around the world and flaunting huge diamonds, but sorry - no sell. It doesn't wash. You are not the same old country girl. Everything is NOT AOK in the USA because this album stinks the place up. Sorry Faith - try again - give us another Breathe and we'll forgive you."
1,"Faith, You can find better songs than these..","I have been a fan of Faith's ever since she came out with, ""Take Me As I Am,"" and I have enjoyed listening and watching her grow into the artist she is now. I like the country songs and the ""pop"" crossover music that she has done in the past. ""Fireflies"" is really bad. ""Mississipi Girl"" is the only decent song and that isn't even that great. I kept on waiting for a song to jump out at me, but the song choice is just bad. Bad lyrics, monotone melodies. I gave this CD away. She shouldn't have released this.I will still stand by her when her next CD comes out, but I wouldn't rush out to buy ""Fireflies.""Check out the import ""greatest hits"" cd instead and her earlier country CD's to keep you tied over until the next one comes out."
2,A Foxy Lady that makes so-so music,"Faith Hill has always bordered on Middle of the Road,but now She is not only riding there but also sorta trying to pull off what Leann Rimes attempted with a even more Pop cross-Over sound&vibe. the results are predictably just average at best. Vocally she sounds good,but Musically alot of Gloss with little Substance.not one song really stands out.Faith Hill is a Foxy Chick,but Musically leaves very little the Imagination.comes off to Pre-Packaged.I give Her Props for hanging around&being very Successful,but this Album is following the exact path&Foundation that got Shania,Garth&The Dixie chicks Over.it has it's place,but never shows any Artistic Growth."
2,This was her worst CD yet.,I have all of her CD's and this was her worst yet. Stupid lyrics. I started to get used to the songs and a few have worn off on me but overall it's not a good CD. I hardly ever listen to it.
5,Faith is FINALLY back with Fireflies!,Faith has released a great cd that brings back memories of some of her past hits and also shows a little taste of something new for her. I love it! It has fun catchy tunes and heart wrenching ballads. It is so good to have her back!
2,Bad CDs/protected,"I ordered this book and paid approx. $75.00. When I got it I tried to burn it into my computer so I could put it on my MP3 player and it wouldn't rip. It ripped half the tracks and not the other half it would only come up as error. So if you want to buy this book don't buy the New Millennium Audio version, it SUCKS!!!"
1,"only heats a 15 gal tank, not a good price",I orderd this tank heater for my rv's holding tank. I looked everywear for the max tank size it heated because my tank was a 30 gal tank . I couldnt find this info in the decription anywear. When the heater came in only then did I find out the heating spcs . I returned the heater unused . You can find a brand name heater for $20 or so more elesewear if you need one for a larger tank than a 15 Gal one
4,Somebody please help!!,"Somebody help me on this. I love Roine Stolt's guitar playing, singing and writing. For me, he helped push Transatlantic into one of the greatest rock bands of all time, if you ask me. I'm also a huge Neal Morse and Mike Portnoy fan.As much as I love Roine's vocals, I'm not that big of the other Flower Kings singer's voice. I know that might upset people. I don't want to do that. I just want to know how much does Roine sing on this CD? Is it 50 percent of the songs? 75 percent? No offense to the other vocalist, it's just that Roine's vocals are much more interesting and unique.Peace"
2,To ride a carousel is fun for a while !!,"Listening to this music is like riding a carousel; its great fun, but in the end you're back where you started and then it all starts over again.I mean I loved Genesis and the art rock scene when I first heard their tunes in the middle of the 70:s. But this , whats the point? It's flawless in it's execution but its like those popular Fantasy Books that never ends you like reading them in the beginning but in book 15 of 37 you start becoming a bit bored of the swords and sorcery and the same goes for the guitar solos and synthesizer soundwalls and the quasi poetry.I'm from sweden and I'm rather proud of what our little country creates in form of popular music, but this is just to much!Sorry boys Steve hacket did this 25 years ago, and better at that without digital guitar processors I'm sorry to say.Per-ke"
3,I hate the vocals !,"They need a new singer , the vocals are pretty bad, musicaly it is definatly fine its just I hate the vocals!I prefer early FK there is a big differance from their vintage prog sonic dreamscape sound they had once to this jazz prog style they seem determind to stick with, even if it doesn`t do much for the vocals."
4,Some great songs; some not so great duds,"Overall, this is a very good FK release, but all of their releases have been good. So, what are the good and bad points? Love Supreme is simply an amazing FKs song: sweeping, grandiose, moving, and thoroughly enjoyable. Other standout tracks include 'Driver's Seat' and 'Timeline'. 'Starlight Man' is also very FKish and reminds me of 'Chicken Farmer' or 'Stupid Girl.' These songs alone make this a worthwhile CD and worthy of the 4 stars.Now, the duds. 'Adam and Eve' is just not a good song....its hard to listen to and not very melodic. The lyrics are pretty bad. The vampire song, no matter how many times I listen to it, just doesn't work. The bridge/chorus is actually good, but I can't get past the brooding/talking versus.I can't complain too much about a band that tries new and different things in their music. The flower Kings remain one of the best bands out there and put out better and more music than 98% of the other stuff on Amazon."
3,No real surprises,"Not a big fan of the cover or title for this, but who cares.FK's single disc albums tend to be more coherent and focused but also tend to be less adventurous. No surprise there, and not too many surprises here (for a FK fan that is). ""Unfold the future"" was for mine a bit too directionless and had too much filler.This album doesn't really have a bad note on it, but it does lack that certain something that keeps me coming back for repeated listens. It's close to their best for vocal harmonies & probably their best sound production to date.Where this album disappoints slightly is in the lack of 'cut loose' technical jam sections, urgency/aggression and experimentation. The emphasis is more on songs, which may mean it is a good point to discover the band, but not if you're a Dream Theater fan.The only minor gripe I ever have with FK is their tendency to sound a bit 'adult contemporary' or 'christian rock' at times, but hey, I can live with it.All in all, a good album (again)."
4,Repeated listening required!,"The first time I listened to Adam & Eve I was mightily disappointed. How could one of my favorite bands put out something so ""different"" from what they had been doing? I must admit it was a bit more of the departure begun on Unfold the Future. So I put it to the side for a week.....I picked up the disc again and listened to it again. Somehow it began sounding much better. The music began to come together and started to make sense. Another listen and it was really becoming quite good!. I now consider this one of their best discs. Repeated listens definately required to appreciate all the complexities going on in this disc.While fans of Stardust We Are and Space Revolver my find this much more complex, it is an outstanding disc if you allow yourself the time to get to know the music. Sometimes the greatest music that offers the best repeat listening is the music that makes the least sense upon initial hearing."
1,fast but not the original parfum,"It arrived earlier than i expected, but the parfurm doesn't smell as strong as the parfurm i used to buy in a normal shop. It's just the same fragance but weaker, as if it was mixed with water, so 5 minutes after spraying the fragance is gone. Definetely not buying from them again!!!"
5,Good small handbook,"Colourful illustrations, a good degree of information offered. I found a lot of material in the book that was very interesting"
2,Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one,I found this book very confusing and the sections just don't match together. There are better books out there for sure.
3,Partly boring - partly exciting,"This collection of stories has it both: it can be utterly boring, and this is true for most of the stories. But there are also very good stories in it. It is significant, though, that the best piece of writing is not fictitious. It is the report of a Little League baseball season, when the author accompanies his 12-year-old son and his team in the local championships. King shows a great feeling for baseball here, and the story is a must for every genuine fan. On the whole the anthology could be a little bit slimmer."
3,An okay horror collection by King,"I liked this book for some of the stories King wrote. But, some of them were just boring and downright stupid. I've read King before, but man, he can do way better than that! But if you're looking for a good and scary story, read ""The Ten O'Clock People"" or ""Crouch End."" Another thing I don't like about some of his stories is that they don't get into the good parts until the story is almost over. I liked ""You Know They've Got a Hell of a Band!"" But, it needed to get more suspense and horror into it at least in the middle of the story. An alright book though!"
5,A true collection of well-written terror.,"i havent read the entire book yet, i read a story or two between the novels i'm reading, but i'll tell waht i think so far.Each story i've read have either shilled or scared me in a way that when the story ends so soon, being short stories and all!, your left to think about it even more. Not to say that they end too quickly or incompletely though. King gives all his short stories as much attention as his novels, and novellas.Popsy, Nightflier, Sorry Right Number, Suffer the little Children, and Chattery Teeth are among the ones i've read. All ranging from monster stories to vampires, Things!! and zombies, muders and mystery etc. A great book in which you can take a story from every night...if u dare that is! ;-)"
3,Nightmares & Dreamscapes,"Good effort by Stephen but interest level varies widely per story.As these are several stories -> good volume of material for the price -> their is also a re-occurring theme in several -> bats, rats, etcPrefer his complete novels although this is good for travelling when reading time is sliced into short periods -> don't have to worry about remembering what you read a week ago."
4,Lots of great stories,"This is the third of King's short story books I've read (""Night Shift"" and ""Everything's Eventual"" being the 1st two). Though I'm only half through the book, I would recommend it to anyone based on the stories I've read so far. King's writing style is documented well enough elsewhere, so I'll spare the reader my armchair interpretations, except to say that I find myself often laughing hysterically at King's descriptions of things and events that shouldn't be funny at all. This is the stuff that makes me want to turn the page to see what happens next."
4,Great stories,"""Dolan's Cadillac"" was my favorite. Good Stephen King book. Stories played back and forth across a wide range of disturbing to frightening with spots of casual or nervous laughs. His stories are nearly always interesting, although a few do go a little far around the corner."
4,Old school King fans rejoice,"I'm a huge fan of King's older works and was finding the newer stuff disappointing in comparison (Insomnia, Gerald's Game, etc etc). This collection is chock full of good old scary stories that would fit right in the pages of Skeleton Crew.Good stuff!"
2,"hit or miss, mostly the latter","I'm not a huge huge King fan. I really loved the Stand as a child and was looking for brain candy for a vacation when I dug this up.The big issue is I don't think King really wrote these aiming to publish them. They read more like self-inflicted writing experiments. I know many novelists will whip out a short story or two just to clear their head. That's what this seems like. Many of the stories are clearly more experimental: let's write a Sherlock Holmes story, let's be even more excessively HP Lovecraft-y, Ohwouldn'tthisideabecrazy.I'm not knocking it, but I didn't find *any* of the stories exceptionally entertaining, and many of them I skipped past without finishing."
4,Good Short Stories,"I enjoyed all the stories in the book, except one so I cannot give the book 5 stars. I found My Pretty Pony to be difficult to ""get into"". My favorite was Dolan's Cadillac, great suspense short story."
3,There are a few pearls here,"This book is another welcome addition to SK's short story library.Most of the storiesare OK.Some are terrible(Dedication,The Ten O;Clock People), some are quite good(Dolan's Cadillac,The Fifth Quarter),and one truly frightening classic, on par with his or any other's best. Read CROUCH END,and see how YOU dream after that!!!!!!!"
3,If all else fails,"Short stories can be one of the best forms of fiction. For one they are short and to the point, no need to build characters or find a structural backbone for the plot. And the best thing is that they usually deliever the plot within a few pages and there is not a lot of time and wasted energy boring your way through a four-hundred-plus page book that consists of no plot impact. Much like Edgar Allen Poe, Stephen King presents a terrific collection of stories that develop a sense of intrigue and awe. I give his other short story works a plus rating as well."
3,Scary??,"Ouch! I thought this was a fair book. Some stories much better than others! I loved dedication, chattery teeth, dolan's cadilac, and the moving finger the most! I dislike the sherlock homes story and the essay."
3,A bit disappointing,"This is the first Stephen King book I actually had a hard time not putting down. This book is a mix of good and bad, but the good doesn't seem strong enough to carry the burgeoning weight of the bad stories. Get this one if you like SK's short stories (frankly, I'm not wild about them, I think King excels at the longer tales)."
3,"Stephen King as a ""junkyard dog""","As the prolific Mr. King mentions in his notes, he wishes to keep us uneasy and wary. He is a junkyard dog in that we should not fall into routine and expect the same horror story over and over.Pieces like ""Umney's Last Case"" and ""My Pretty Pony"" seem more like exercises in different styles than the reader is used to. There is also the non-fiction piece ""Head Down"" which is about a Little League baseball championship from many years back.Don't get me wrong, if you a fan of Stephen King's writing (not just of horror), this is a good book. There are also notes in the back which explain where he go the idea for most of the stories. For aspiring writers, this is probably not a detailed as you'd like, but is good nonetheless.For diehard horror fans, there are a few stories that will chill you as only Stephen King can, but quite a bit of this book may feel unnecessary. I would recommend borrowing the book."
5,so good i'd read it again (maybe),"This book is one of the best pieces of Stephen King writing I have ever read. After you've read something like Night Shift you need something to cool yourself down with. This book does just that and it comes with a lot of non-stop reading excitement. Some of my fav stories were ""chattery teeth"" ""the end of the whole mess"" and ""you know they got a hell of a band."""
2,A waste of money,"I've always loved short stories, particularly horror fiction, so as you can imagine how much I looked forward to reading Stephen King's 'Nightmares and Dreamscapes'. The only reservation I had was that I had already read much of the book in other anthologies - and in no case had I been overly impressed - but surely there would be something new to make the book worth buying? Boy was I disappointed! Most of the stories (e.g. Popsy, My Little Pony) are so weak that I doubt they would have been published at all without the Stephen King name. My guess is that they were rejects he had been hanging on to for years, until he could use them as filler when he was short of original ideas. There is NOTHING here that comes near the standard set by 'Skeleton Crew' or 'Night Shift' or even 'Four Past Midnight'. Nightmares indeed ..."
2,Hard to believe he actually got this published,"After I read this book I found it hard to believe that Stephen King, the once master of suspense, actually wrote it. It lacked depth, imagination, and creativity, and left no impression on the memory. What was his point? If King could go back and erase just one of his works I'm sure this would be it."
2,Skip It,"I am a fan of King's work but aside from the first story, Doran's Cadillac, I was disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone. To be fair, I will try to start where I abandoned this book one more time. Stick to Different Seasons if you want a collection of King's."
3,Somewhat out of the ordinary,"This book was so diffrent from all the other king books I read. It is a brighter book than sceleton crew, and some of it's stories seem like they were put there simply to take up room."
3,IT IS OK BUT NOT THAT GREAT,There are a few good stories but not many. It takes a while in each of the stories to get to the good part. But it was well written.
4,Consisten in giving me chills,A great collection of short stories by one of the greatest authors ever. This book shines on some of kings strongest writing abilities and is a great book for quick reading - Most of the stories are able to be read in one brief sitting. If there is one thing that the stories in this book have in common it is that they were all consisten in giving me chills.
4,Oooo.... creepy book!,"I REALLY liked this book! (this among other Stephen King books) I liked how it was a collection and not just one... it was new for me, and it's a collection of different tastes. My favorite so far was the one about the frogs.. the ones that always came during rainy season and the couple who got stuck in a basement when the frogs decided thier fate (how sad)... =). That was definitely my fav. I also liked the one about the guy who buried that one other guy in the desert in his cadillac.... some of these were really CREEPY, but they were good nevertheless. now the one story about the finger coming back to life... now that was wacky..."
3,King writes good short stories,"Most of Stephen King's novels are mere tripe, but he is great in short forms and the epic. A self described bad explainer, he does best when restrained or let free. My favorites in this collection were ""The Ten O'Clock People,"" ""Sorry, Right Number,"" ""Chattery Teeth,"" ""The Moving Finger,"" and ""You Know They Got One Hell of a Band."" Since several reviewers have compared ""Crouch End"" to H.P. Lovecraft, I plan to read his work. Overall, a good collection of short stories, some scary, some funny, and most were interesting."
4,Crouch End - A Classic,"This book was pretty decent, I'm surprised nobody has talked about what I think is the scariest story in the book and one of the best he has written, Crouch End. Even though you know what will happen because it is written in flashbacks, I found that the nightmarish imagery of the London town as the couple gets more and more lost was very frightening and actually made my skin scrawl, something that none of his works had done since Pet Sematary. As you keep reading, the headline ""Sixty Lost in Underground Horror"" starts to get your imagination going.Rainy Season was also pretty good, it will make you squeamish about frogs for a long time."
5,Bone chilling,"The stories just take my breath away. I don't know how else to explain them...they're just FANTASTIC!!!! The first story I ever read of Mr. King's was ""Dolan's Cadillac"" and I was hooked. This book is a must for all Stephen King fans."
2,Halfway through & not even half-scared,"I had every intention of finishing this 800+ page short story collection, but by the time I was halfway through, I hadn't been frightened once and was worn out from getting my hopes up and then having them dashed. I will stick to King's novels from now on."
1,How about an honest review,"I already purchased this book and was curious before starting it what the overall evaluation of this book was. It's obvious that some people (publisher perhaps?) has taken it upon themselves to stack 5 star ratings rather than provide honest reviews. Come on, 11/11 positive feedbacks for a 3 line review??"
1,Great premise -- terrible execution,"The whole idea of miracles, saints, and how to ""prove"" such things, is fascinating. Unfortunately, in the hands of the author, the scenario becomes a cartoonish exercise with stereotypical and poorly drawn characters. Some of the scenes actually made me cringe, they were so crudely written and unbelievable. The dialogue is clumsy and at times downright laughable; I wondered where the editor was when the manuscript was being prepared. I stuck with it because I thought the premise was a good one, but it was a total waste of time. I can only hope that in the proposed movie version that they hire a scriptwriter who knows how to write dialogue and create a plot that works. Mr. Vetere certainly doesn't."
5,Bonsai landscape,I was amazed at what this guy does. the hours he puts into itshows. wish I knew where I could find some rocks similar tothese. I will be useing his ideas in my next work.
5,magnificent,"This is so very beautiful. It is actually Chinese Penjing, or Japanese Bonkei. This book is very well done, the kind of coffee table book you'll enjoy for a long time- if you like this art form. I have to keep from drooling on it. I do this art form, though in much smaller forms. It is magnificently beautiful."
1,THIS IS A REAL STINKER,THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD MICKY ROONEY IN THIS FLOP I CANT GET OVER WELL IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND YOU WANT TO BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE DONT PAY OVER 2DOLLARS FOR IT.................
3,Not bad...,"I would buy it solely for the killer toys. This movie has it's moments, but it is mostly dry and devoid of any actual horror. The twist ending is stupid but SOMEHOW makes sense. I would wait until they got this out on DVD along with the other three or four they're still missing."
1,Why was this made?,"Silent Night, Deadly Night was a brilliant masterpiece of holiday horror. Once it hit number two, it went down the proverbial toilet. So you can imagine what unbelievable excrement the fifth one must be. This one is filthy excrement. Graphic violence, horrible (and I do mean horrible) acting and a plot that was doomed from the beginning.Do not buy this movie. Do not see this movie. It is not worth anybody's time."
2,ILHM Reviews Silent Night Deadly Night 5,"Mickey Rooney plays a demented toymaker, Joe Petto, whose hand-made toys are to die for! SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 5 may not be a great film. It may not even be a good film for that matter. But it is at least better than the previous sequels by comparison. It actually centers around the holiday for starters, but it is also very mean-spirited and unique. The problem, as always with these films, is that the interesting premise is quickly destroyed by the drab acting and storyline. Who are we to side with here? The neglectful mother and her mute child? The obsessive Santa stalker? The crazed toymaker? Or maybe the guy who can't seem to keep the boom mic out of the shot? Thankfully, the film packs enough mild gore and Mickey Rooney 'splotation to keep things moving, if only at a crawl. The creative effects that come out of the final scene are worth the wait, so sit back and enjoy as the killer toys take over Christmas!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
4,Complete overview to J2EE development with WebSphere,"This is a comprehensive book which covers every topic from installation, to application design and performance tuning with WebSphere. Their is very little code, a surprising number of screenshots. The text is uniformly architectural, ranging from somewhat in-depth (e.g. the coverage of EJBs), to very in-depth (e.g. the chapter on security).If you are new to J2EE development and you are looking for an overall field guide to the topic at the architectural level, then this may be the book for you. If you are looking for in-depth coverage of specific topics, like EJBs, deployment, or performance tuning, then you should look for other books that are more in-depth."
2,Couldn't install the trial version,"I preffer to try it in a real life invironment - couldn't install the trial version from the disk to XP, Windows Server 2003 - some eerors; how can I try it? Gave up at some point. CDs provided are not good"
4,Almost Complete Verve Master Takes,"Don't get me wrong -- the music is fantastic and the sound is terrific. I am happy to have purchased it in this form.BUT, this assuredly is NOT the complete studio master takes of Parker's Verve/Clef material:Missing are:(1) Repetition, from the same day as ""The Bird""(2) A few Latin-flavored sides from late 1948 and early 1949: No Noise; Mango Mangue; Okiedoke(3) Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite(4) Two songs from a 1950 session with Coleman Hawkins -- Celebrity (Celerity) and Ballade.Items (2) and (4) are on Parker's ""South of the Border: Verve Latin Jazz Sides"".I guess they must have REALLY wanted to squeeze it on three CDs."
3,Carbonated wine,"Under-appreciated British eighties pop act were known for their classy production work and hooky, emotional melodies and to that end, succeeded easily with TCOS, though the brief disc of nocturnal electronic rhythms lacks a unifying consistency, keeping it inside the ""classy head-bobbing"" category."
3,Words From Wich Myth?,I think that this is an o.k. book about words it's almost like a dictionary of words used in myths but they are not in alphabetical order. It doesn't say wich myth this word comes from or anything. It could be a little better but at least it gave part of a story. Whoever wrote it had a good idea about it but I don't think they knew how to start. It mostly had the names of the gods and goddesses. If it is called words from myths it should have explanations of the places too.
2,Not worth the Parabens,"First thing that happened: the top broke off and was terribly hard to pop back on before half this extremely expensive product spilling all over the shower. Then I realized that it contains parabens like Methylparaben, a preservative found in cancerous tumors and suspected toxin many people and cosmetics companies are avoiding. Not worth the risk."
3,Please Be Quiet...,"Kool and the gang are/were at their best playing instrumentals. they would set a groove early and play it out until the end of the song - no interruptions. Music is the message is fat with vocals. while this isn't altogether a bad thing, it does seem to throw the groove off at times. i can't help but wonder what a smoker ""funky granny"" would be if they didn't feel the need to throw in the silly granny voices. i don't even flip over the screams and shouts on tunes like soul vibrations and love the life you live. they're fine, but they don't seem necessary to me. i suppose they do give the tunes a sense of energy though. fortunately, music is the message still has that head noddin' appeal to it. the instrumentation is great and the solos are raw and soulful. plus, electric frog parts 1 and 2 are top notch instrumental funk."
4,Overall a great book with a few disappointments,"I loved Tori's album ""Scarlet's Walk"" and could not wait to get the book. Personally, I like to be able to play the songs as much like they sound on the album as possible, so I was happy with this book overall. I know she never arranges every song on the album for accompaniment. A few always have the melody built in to it. The songs that are arranged to sound like the album version are Amber Waves, A Sorta Fairytale, Wednesday, Strange, Carbon, Sweet Sangria, Your Cloud, Pancake, New York, Mrs. Jesus, Scarlet's Walk, Virginia and Gold Dust.Then Crazy, Vegas, Taxi Ride, and Paradise all have the built in melody and obviously Wampum Prayer is just the vocal line. All in all the arrangements are very good but I was slightly disappointed with how simple Fairytale was, even though it's arranged to sound pretty much just like the album. I was still very happy with the book and definetly recommend it."
4,Tori -- Laid Back,"I could listen to this album whenever I need to relax. It's one of those albums that you can listen to the entire thing & not skip through any songs. It doesn't have the &quot;sing-ability&quot; of some of her others (Under The Pink, etc...), but Tori is forever experimenting with new mediums & integrating them into her amazing fluid style. I keep this in my car & just enjoy the drive as this angel's voice lilts about me..."
5,Awesome with an amazing twist,"This movie is a thrill ride that I never want to get off! It's like Natural Born Killers meets TheTexas Chainsaw Massacre. Please release it on DVD. I kept my VCR to play it. If you love this one also check out one of the director's other flicks "" The Convent."" It is hard to find on DVD, but it was released in that format because I have it.Break out your VCR, find a horror nut friend like me who still has one for gem's like this and give this a watch. Get some popcorn and rock out to the beginning ""In-Gada-Da-Vida"" massacre. If you don't love this movie and make it your lives mission to find it on dvd, there's something seriously wrong with you."
4,MIKE MENDEZ`S REAL KILLERS,"I WISH THIS WAS ON DVD,THIS WAS CRAZY ASS MOVIE.LIKE IT ALOT 4/5.COULD BE A CLASSIC"
3,"Surprise to have on CD, likely mastered from vinyl","I was so excited to see this Mary album on CD, as none of her other albums (besides ""Mary"") have made it to the digital age yet. Upon listening to it today, it's obvious to me this was a transfer made by someone with a vinyl copy of the album, using software to clean it up. No pops or clicks, but also no tape hiss regardless of how high you turn it up (which means the high end has been altered). When Mary starts belting you can hear the distortion typical of an old vinyl record in the vocals. I appreciate having this on CD nonetheless, just wish it was a legit release from the label that owned the masters."
3,"Nice camera, but weak battery door is a design flaw","I've had this camera for about a year and really like its performance. It's great on batteries (2-AA) and the features are extensive. Unfortunately, it suffers from Weak Battery Door Design syndrome, depending on a small plastic catch to retain both the batteries and the media card. My camera finally bit the dust on a trip to Sweden, when it fell from a car seat about two feet to the ground. The battery door catch broke and now it can't be used unless you hold the door closed with a clamp or really strong tape. If they had only designed the door as well as the rest of the camera-- in metal --I'm sure it would still be working fine.This is a common flaw with many electronic products. How many dozens of cameras, radios, CD players, etc. have we all seen with broken battery doors over the years? Unfortunately with this item, it's basically unusable if it breaks and impossible to repair."
2,poor quality,This DVD was produced very poorly with no shown titles at the beginning of each song and with no subtitles for the songs. Few people could understand foreign languages especially during the songs being played.
2,Disappointed,"This dvd is essentially an low-quality production of her performance at a regional fair. The video style and audio quality are marginal. Her performance, while pleasing, had none of the dynamic range I had come to expect. I'll wait for a more competent production from London. The dvd is disappointing, because she has so much talent and it's simply not present here."
5,A definite buy,"Katherine Jenkins voice and style make her an amazing classical crossover performer. She's become a perfect replacement for Sarah Brightman, since Sarah has gone off the deep end. No, this concert isn't opera, but Katherine's mezzo-soprano voice is better than many mezzos that you will hear at The Met.It's not recorded at the Royal Albert Hall with the London Symphony. It's just a great crossover classic performance, done in a relaxed setting. The video quality is OK and the audio track is OK, not great, but OK. If you like classical crossover music, you will definitely enjoy this DVD!"
3,Live at LLangollen,"Enjoyed the music, singing and scenary. Also gave this as a gift to a Welsh friend because we enjoyed it so much."

5,Buy it from the musician on Amazon,This is a wonderful CD available from Patty Greer on Amazon. This particular listing has NO inventory and NO way to download MP3s. Find it for only $9.99 from the artist and enjoy the music! It is stellar!
3,Last Decent Jerky Boys CD,"While it's not quite quite up to par with the original, they do a good job of inventing some new characters and keep things relatively fresh. This is probably the last good album they released...they really strained themselves trying to cook up the sequel, Jerky Boys 4, and it shows. After that they broke up and the last two albums are just bland attempts at trying to keep the name alive. So this might be a good place to complete your collection if you already have the first two albums (but if your desperate for more, get the bootlegs that have been floating around that catch the duo in their prime. In fact the only reason those recordings weren't officially released is because they were sooo good at pissing people off many wouldn't sign the release form to let them put the calls on an album.)"
5,Great album!,"This album is on par with Jerky Boys 2.""Angry Camper's Dad"" is riotous. You'll probably fall down from laughing when you hear that clip. Frank calls up a camp to complain that other kids have been picking on his son. He's says the other kids have been taking dumps in Mikey's (Frank's son's) laundry bag and have been ""jagging"" Mikey with a baseball bat. It's absolutely hilarious.""1-800-How's My Driving"" is quite possibly the funniest Jerky Boys clip ever. Frank Rizzo calls up one of those 1-800 numbers listed on the back of trucks. He wants to complain about a truck driver that backed up over his legs several times. Although Frank can't remember the name of the business, he does recall that some swill was dripping out of the back of the truck. It's so funny!!!""TV Repair"" is also great. Kissel calls up a department store to complain about a TV he just bought there. Anyway, while he's on the phone Pico is trying to fix the set. Pico almost gets electrocuted. You'll love it!!!"
5,They never Fail,What can I say it's the Jerky Boys and they always leave me laughing. Some of them are not as funny as others but that is the same with anything. I like em and will always buy their stuff!
2,Motor mount kit,"Returned this item two times, not because it was defective, but because it did not fit my 73 mustang I even got my friend the mechanic to help me put them in the second time , I mean the product look great but I was not able to try it out for that, I only give it two stars"
1,HATE IT! Used twice and the spring broke!!,I bought this for my son and was very disappointed when it broke the second time it was used...end of story.
4,A little more please,"The title is as it says Stickley and Ellis. I was still hoping to find some Greene and Greene or Maybeck work though.Robert has put many many hour into reproducing the details, well done.It would be great to find the artwork in electronic format for CNC cutting.The hardware examples all from Stickley and limited to pulls and a few hinges.I found the text in the first part of the book informative reading."
5,Tight and Sturdy,"No surprises here. These are study 8.5 x 12"" mailers which is the perfect size for shipping books, dvds, and similar media. As of yet, I haven't encountered any issues where the mailer alone failed to protect the shipped product."
5,Great flatware for the price!,"First, I did not purchase this flatware from Amazon. I purchased it from our local Kohl's. It was on sale (clearance) for $15. I bought two sets. I have young children and realize that every once and a while place settings find their way to the trash or outdoors!We absolutely love the flatware. It is sturdy and doesn't bend like many lesser quality flatware. The only complaint that I have is that in my dishwasher it the individual pieces (spoons with spoons, forks with forks) tend to attach to each other and not get clean. I try and keep the pieces separated and this tends to resolve the problem. The only other issue is that the flatware does have a tendency to spot, but this may also be my dishwasher.If you can find this flatware, buy it!!! You won't be disappointed."
4,Big and simple,"My wife and I both dislike the curlicues that adorn a lot of silverware. We wanted something clean-looking and inexpensive, and this set is definitely it.One could question the proportioning of the dinner forks and knives; they're truly massive. But they feel very good in the hand because of the weight.One of the knives got a small discoloration, but everything else has cleaned up perfectly after several runs through the dishwasher. The satin finish shows detergent spots more than a glossier finish might, so make sure your dishwasher's got enough Jet-Dry.UPDATE: A few months in, I have to say that the spotting issue has become a genuine irritant. It's worse with some detergents than others."
3,"Great weight, odd sizes",This flatware has a wonderful weight and balance. I give it only three stars because the forks are enormous - I mean BIG - and the soup spoons are on the small side. I don't know what happened to the human factors engineer on this set - perhaps she/he was on vacation.
1,leaves grey markings on all of my dinnerware!,"this product is beautiful and heavy, yet it is ruining my dinnerware! each time a piece makes contact with my nautica arctic white dinnerware, a permanent grey marking is left upon my plate/bowl! i have tried everything and nothing will remove these marks. i have had my dishes for 5+ years with not even one mark...i've had this flatware for 2 months and it has ruined my entire collection of dinnerware! i am so at a loss for the poor quality of this flatware. i would not recommend this set to anyone...keep shopping."
3,Just okay,"It's a lot smaller than I expected, about 5"" and about 1/2"" in diameter. I originally didn't care for this vibe, but I find that it's best if used with a partner. I'm still not crazy about the bumps, they can cause irritation if you're not careful."
2,too much fluff,Easy to read - but anyone bright enough to be successful in business would find much of the material obvious.
2,It's too hard to say,The pictures are very nice and the captions are cute but the names are too hard to say and there is no pronunciation hints. That defeats the purpose of the exercise.
2,T should stand for T-Rex,"My 4 year old son did not like this book because all of the Dinosaurs that Mr. Pallotta wrote about were obscure - for example T does not stand for Tyrannasaurus Rex. He was so disappointed when we got to the letter T. I also think that since dinosaur names are so complex, this is not a great format for teaching ABC's."
5,The dinosaur book,"Both my Grandchildren are in to Dinosaurs, when my Granddaughter was sudding in them in school for a little, she took her book in and shared it with the class."
5,Raymond at Ashley River El.,I gave this book five stars because I think the illustrations are interesting.My favorite letter is F which stands for Fabrosauraus. I like it because it is well illustrated even though Ralph does not know what dinosaurs looked like.I like learning the dinosaur's names.Jerry Pallotta did a good job getting facts. The only bad part is having to pronounce the names. I also think T should be for T-rex so all the T-rex fans out there.
4,Daniel at Ashley River El.,"I liked the Dinosaur Alphebet book because the names were challenging and I learned different dinosaur names, also because it has hidden messages."
1,primitive harmony,"I live on a diet of interesting rhythm and harmony, though my music theory is not that advanced. I love bebopp and this music is so un-complex as to boor me to the point of turning it off after a few songs. i have never made it through the album and that is rare for me. The fidelity is good but cannot redeem it."
3,"""Good, but not a classic"".","These guys had a ill debut, but their sophomore is luke-warm, to say the least. I'm not saying it's wack, there's a few good songs here, but nothing classic. Two dope MC's with a mediocre second release. It's still a good CD, it's just not the ""BOMB""!"
1,Works but does not last,"The 8500 works great but it does not last. 20 min on then 20 min off to cool down. I have one with the problem, I know 3 others with the problem and there are many more on the web with the same problem. Escort can fix it for $85 but it is with same junk parts that caused the problem. DUH! What Escort should do is a recall the 8500 and fix it for free. I will never buy another Escort product."
5,This book is great,"I think it is good that Rilo appointed Morgan the head of the group. Morgan is really aware of this stuff that's going on. He really cares about what happens to Fairfield and his friends. I would like to see if later he becomes like Skinny Joe and Darren. David should now look up to Morgan as a leader and respect him I'm not saying he doesn't already, I'm just saying that he should start respecting him more. David should look at Morgan as an example."
4,Good snack!,Good eats! Jack Link's products are less greasy than the competitors. I travel often and do not like sugary snacks. These sticks hit the spot better than a candy bar.
2,SO-SO Beef sticks.,I think their regular 3.6 oz. beefsteak jerkey's are about the best there is. These are just O.K. Nothing special.
2,Joins aren't repairable,This is a great thing and a lot simpler than soldering. I loved using until... We had a joint that leaked on us.If your joint leaks you can't repair it. You have to cut it out and try again. Soldering is a bit more of a pain but if it leaks you can fix it without resorting to cutting the joint out again.After a second leaky joint out of the 15 we needed to do we finished the project with solder.
4,It could be better !,"Its a fast read and it lead me to lala land. Since I read pretty fast I finished it quick. It wasn't too short or anything like that its just I like how everything is compiled together for an easier read and characters that you can only wonder about. Like the green witch Allegra meeting Kate the vet and how they fell in love on the spot. But my favorite character has to be Gigi (Kate's friend), she just made me laugh on her antics when she knows she was gay at age 6. All in all its weird but good."
2,could not get into it.,didnt like I couldn't get into the story line. But its been a while sice i purchased it so maybe Ill give it another try.
2,Why?,I received a 30 day trial of this software from Microsoft. I used it to update my website that is hosted by Yahoo. I had to load the FrontPage extensions to the server then convert my current pages to FrontPage. This made me go through the process of reformatting nearly everything. The simple on-line tools that yahoo provides did a better job and quicker than this software. I suppose if you really are an office expert and want the look and feel of the office interface then you might like it. Otherwise I think you can do better elsewhere. This software takes the cookie cutter approach to building a web presence. Microsoft was offering a 30 day CD trial but have stopped that. I wonder why they don't want you to try it out any more before you buy it? Why indeed!
1,This software does not work,"Quite simply this software does not work, and I've been using other versions of FrontPage since it first came out--check out the Microsoft web site--they have loads of 'fixes' for this software. None of the web component functions work, and neither does shared borders. I can't imagine that they would continue to sell this."
2,Easy but useless,"I took an web page design class and we used this program, and its very easy to use, but if you want to make a website that actually MAKES a difference, I suggest using Marcomedia and teaching yourself how to do flash. I wouldn`t waste my money on some program that you can`t do much with."
2,AGHHHH!!!!,"I used the FP 2000 free trial package to create a simple site and loved so I ordered FP2002 and HATE it. IT doesn't help that I can't find a manual that actually helps. It is truly not for the novice unless you plan to create a VERY simple site with limited ""cool stuff"" like graphics that aren't rectangles and you don't require the buttons to actually look good. I'd hire a professional to create the site and then learn just enough of FP to update it yourself. It's worth the money to avoid the headaches."
3,Not like its hyped up to be...,"First of all I'm going to say its very good for novices. BUT BE WARNED: The server extenshions dont work well. I had my entire site relying on them (big mistake) and then to make a long story short I looked at it one day and it had fried. I was so mad. By the way though if your a student (K-12) try and get the education version of Studio MX, its better and costs about fifty dollars more. But if you dont fit the requierments and your on a budget I'd go with FrontPage. (Also if you can afford Dreamweaver too buy them both, they work really good together.)"
4,Greate Software for the non-Professional,"I have used Frontpage for years, and I must admit it is a great website design program for the non-professional. A couple years ago I started my own website design business and turned to Macromedia Dreamweaver. Although the learning curve is quite harder than Frontpage, Dreamweaver is much more powerful. I would recomend Frontpage to non-Professionals, but if you happen to be a professional, then choose Dreamweaver. Although it's more expensive, its worth the money. I have to say that they are both excelent products."
1,Don't buy this program.,This program is the industry standard of what NOT TO DO. If you are not a web designer and just want to make a website there are better free programs out there than FrontPage and if you are planning on making websites for money I recomend Dreamweaver or the Dreamweaver Studio that comes with Fireworks also. FrontPage is to limiting and gave me nothing but trouble setting up sites. Run as far away from this product as you can and tell all your friends to do the same.
1,Just plain bad,"Frontpage is notorious for changing standard HTML into a ""special"" version that does not work with other editors and does not conform with international standards of HTML (any version). It is the opinion of every webmaster I have spoken to, since looking at this product, that FrontPage is an attempt by Microsoft to sell their wares because only Microsoft servers have no problem serving up webpages made with this product. Do yourself a favor and skip this software for anything else. The Adobe GoLive is still better than this or Dreamweaver."
1,Front Page 2002 makes your PC unusable,"I was using Front Page 2000, together with Win 98 and Office 97, without much trouble and got my things going, but once I decided to install the new ""upgrade"" for Front Page 2002, my whole system drove crazy.Now the system constantly crash when using Outlook and Internet Explorer - almost make my PC unusable.This problems are not mentioned in any known information source I have looked into. I'm almost decided to dump the new Front Page in my garbage can and go back where I was - when I was able to use my PC without restarting it 5 or 6 times a day."
1,Flabby non-standards compliant code,If you want to produce standards compliant code that will work with multile servers and browsers then stare clear of FrontPage. Try Homesite or if you have the money DreamWeaver.
2,Multiple Web Sites,"The Upload function works nicely enough, but it is impossible to control which files get uploaded. You need to select each file individually, then send them to your site. There seems to be no way to have seperate accounts set up on Front Page. I have two websites, and must constantly go back and delete files I did not want uploaded. I've tried setting up two Front Page Files, but it is not easily done. I would look for a cheaper program, Front Page is not worth the money."
1,Ugly and difficult to use,"Perhaps later versions are better (but I doubt it). The software is not intuitive, the resulting Web pages are unattractive, and the manual is worthless.Either spend more money on better software, or else accept the other alternative which is using free site building software (more available these days anyway)."
1,Never again...,"I have been a committed user of FrontPage since the days of FP 98, but this product is so full of bugs it makes me wonder why MS had the audacity to release it.It still produces the most cumbersome code. Have a look at the html after you have imported a word document! Each import takes about 20 minutes to clean up.FP 2002 is most definately a step backwards, if you are using FP 2000, don't upgrade, stick to what you have got and in your spare time learn dreamweaver.The greatest irritation, its inability to cope with publishing big sites, has still not been fixed.Sorry - I have had enough.."
1,More feature creep and locking,"While one must admire Microsoft's constant addition of functionality to already-satisfactory programs, this is a bit of an extreme. FP2002 is fairly easy to use, but seems a little buggy in terms of the ""finished"" page staying as saved. Importing chunks of data from various Office programs is easy enough, but not really any more facile than with other web editors.More serious, for some users, may be incompatibility with other authoring programs. If you just wanted Word or Excel to write docs/spreadsheets and print them at home, great. But if you'd like your web files to be portable to other programs, this one isn't so good - lost of unnecessary code and other incompatibilities. I recommend DreamWeaver for most people; if you stay in this game, you'll eventually wind up there anyway. Start with a better program, save time and money in the not-too-long run, and ensure that your files can be ported to another program and platform."
2,Atrocious product,"I purchased FrontPage to create our company webpage. I am a novice at web page design, so I thought this product would be a good buy. Not so. (1) The package does not come with a manual! Instead, you get a booklet with a very general overview. If you need more detail you have to go out and purchase another book. I didn't like this. I looked into the book from which the booklet was culled and it read like an astrophysics text: Too much information, wholly irrelevant to my goal. Not user-friendly at all. I discovered some other books that were more readable, but then: (2) I was able to produce only very crude pages with this program. I thought this was my fault, until I got Dreamweaver and cranked out some beautiful pages with relatively little effort."
4,Not Just Some Good.....,"The latest upgrade to Microsoft's FrontPage web authoring tool is...Well, pretty darn good. I know that there are FP detractors out there who say, ""I don't like FP it messes with my code!"". This latest version messes with it less although quite frankly Frontpage is not aimed at whining code junkies. It does a great job of allowing entry level to intermediate web designers to get their sites up and running in a minimum of time. Those people who already hate this utility will not like it any better after using '02. Dreamweaver would probably be a better (although much more expensive) choice for them. But if you want extreme ease of use and a very shallow learning curve this is for you."
3,NEEDS INSTRUCTIONS,When trying to enact front page I read through the directions. They are woefully inadequate. There are no pictorials showing you precisely what the scanty information they have are referring to.
3,Frontpage 2002 would have been great only if it were,"priced lower. Take a look at namo webeditor which costs only 99 bucks and comes with everything that fronpage offers plus alot more. you should only consider getting frontpage only if you are purchasing a complete set of MS office which includes ms frontpage. Otherwise, stick with namo. namo.com is where you get the price. amazon should work harder to get a better price though."
3,Great application with major defect - buyers beware!,"I really like the ease of use and have used FP2002 to build two comprehensive websites. Up until last month I was happy - but there is a major defect that could spoil your opinion. Until they fix the problem, it has soured my opinion of FP2002.The problem - due to an unknown (at this time) bug that some believe is a result of an early June 2002 Microsoft security download, your FP2002 may lose its ability to view the WYSIWYG webpage when you click the ""Preview"" tab. Others are also reporting this problem on newsgroup sites. Essentially, Preview loses its ability to recognize your website's CSS and will not load the proper formatting. Your workaround is to view the web page in your browser. No word (that I'm aware of) from Microsoft on when they will address a fix for this defect. Better hold off your purchase until they can fix it. Why pay for 75% functionality?"
1,Avoid it like the plague.,"If you're at all acquainted with web design, then you probably know everything you need to about FrontPage: it writes non-compliant code; it has a horrible interface; and is generally unintuitive and non-industry standard. In short, it's ugly and doesn't play well with others.If you are new to web design, read the above and then avoid FrontPage like the plague.Want to get started building web pages with little knowledge of HTML? Use what the pros use -- buy Macromedia's ""DreamWeaver"" or Adobe's ""GoLive"". You'll be SOOOOO glad you did."
3,Good starting point for doing your own small website.,"This will get you up and running a web site quickly, plus alot of hosting companies support Frontpage. If you are into MS products; like publisher or word, then Frontpage is probably a good way for you to build your first simple website. You better buy a book on Frontpage however or you'll be lost, the user guide you get with the software is useless. In my opinion the templates [...] not very sophisticated. [...] Otherwise Frontpage is a good [inexpensive]way to get started in web design."
4,Go Solar!,"If you can grab a copy of this book, it is well worth it. A good mix of science, economics, and policy. Very qualitative information on how solar cells work and their potential, won't bore you with tons of equations. For the scientist and nonscientist, although a little background will make it more interesting. Not too outdated, would be nice to see an updated edition to include progress in the 90's."
1,"Fake, illegal, and complete garbage","Amazon should stop sellers from so blatantly ripping off artists. Jero is now infamous for cobbling together nonsense, homemade, hack job and last but not least illegal bootleg recordings of suspect quality and origin."
1,How?,"The project sounds very interested but how am I going to place an order if I don't have any information of songs. I only hope those are not crappy remixes. Can't anybody come out with something as creative as ""Love"" by The Beatles?"
5,Great Album,"Wow! I have been a kimya fan since the moldy peaches and her first solo album ""I'm sorry that sometimes i'm mean"" but this is even better. Kimya acheives using a naieve, down to earth method of bringing across subjects that are very deep. Unlike her other albums which were recorded in her bedroom on her 4 track, she recorded at a friends house, and altogether brings across a more group effort. I say that because she has her friends sing on some of the tracks, in fact there is a whole chorus on ""I will never forget"" and it is stunning. this is a great album! I luv u kimya."
2,book/verse search,"I have an original Kindle Fire. I bought this book, (cheap enough at less than $2), and after reading the description on how to search thought it would be easy to find verses.Terrible is all I have to say. This may work on a newer version than the older style search (that shows the little magnifying glass).I followed the instructions for searching: ge.3.15 (genesis 3: verse 15) but the search said ""no results found"" It took forever to just to find the book of Matthew! Not only that, the book only shows chapters and verses on each page without the name of which book it is; Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.No table of contents page with highlighted book names or chapters for shortcuts like other books (novels) either.Like I said; this may work on a newer version of Kindle, but definetly NOT on the older ones!-"
5,Great resource!,"This is a great resource for parents, grandparents, teachers, or anyone dealing with children! Deals with many topics such as:anger, faith, discernment,greed, integrity, honesty,money, laziness, self-respect, obedience, and habits, just to name a few. Each title lists numerous Bible verses, discussion questions, steps for action and parenting tips. Excellent book. The author has basically done the work for you!!"
5,Incredible resource for Parents!,This book has been an incredible resource for us! We use it to preteach character traits. We discuss the topic and then go over some of the corresponding verses. It is also very useful to turn to when your children are encountering specific issues. You can quickly turn to a topic and find Scriptures to help. Our children are small so we summarize some of the discussion but I can easily see this being a book we use their entire childhood. I have already bought two extras to give as gifts to friends. Can't say enough about this one! You need it!!
4,Great reference for Christian parents!,"I have been using this book for almost 10 years now to refer to biblical scripture. I have found it to be an excellent resource for teachable moments when it helps to have a scripture back-up to explain what God says about a topic. We all have to pick our battles, especially as our kids get older. This has eliminated many battles because my kids understand the power in hearing it from God's word. I also like the activities that are included with many of the topics. Having a tangible way for my kids to learn about a topic helps reinforce the real meaning of the scripture for them. EVERY parent should own a copy."
5,Incredibly useful!!!,"Fantastic! This has been so helpful in the life of my family. We use it very often. It is so easy to look things up and use the icons from the key to instruct you how to put these thoughts into actions. Great Bible refrences! There is a Bible verse for every topic! It's just a great reference to have. It keeps you out of sticky situations when you do not know how to explain things to your children, and even yourself! I often give this to my girl friends at baby showers. So great!"
4,Love Travels,"This has good solid songs and one really good one called ""The End of the Line"". Kathy Mattea has such a strong interesting voice she makes every song worth listening to."
2,Someone needs a copy editor,"The number of typos in this book is astronomical. It's a fine guide/translation, but the number of times things are misspelled is disgusting and fairly distracting."
3,Inexpensive and very okay,"Roche's Signet Classic ""Four Plays by Aristophanes"" provides good contemporary translations of Lysistrata, The Frogs, A Parliament of Women, and Plutus. On the negative side, the renderings are not terrifically inspired. The paper is too pulpy for a ""classic,"" but that's a drawback of most (though not all) inexpensive classics nowadays. My printing of Roche, however, is not thick or blotchy, though I've noticed the Signet Classics sometimes tend in that direction.Gone are the days, evidently, when the pages of a Signet Classic always looked crisp and stayed bright for decades. I've got some from the '60s that still look good.Roche's introduction and notes to these four plays are brief but solid."
1,"boring, not at all what I expected",This was extremely dry and boring reading. I thought it would be enlightening and provide some sort of useful information but instead I found it to contain statistics and reading felt disjointed. I found this to be completely useless in helping me understand and tap into my students.
3,It arrived without an earing.,"One of the earring was missing when it arrived. It looked like it was glued on poorly. The accessories look pretty flimsy, but the rest of the doll (actual body) looks pretty nice."
2,porcelin doll,"beautiful costume ,however her head is turned sideways and she looks goofy on display...disappointing to say the least. hard to tell in picture..."
2,Great idea but...,"I am a huge breastfeeding activist and was very excited to receive this picture book- but like another reviewer I was left feeling extremely underwhelmed.The rhymes are forced- the writing is just sloppy. I really would have believed it was written by a 6th or 7th grader.Yes it is cute and yes it contains lots of pictures of breastfeeding and yes I still have it out on display in my midwifery practice so that the kids can flip through it- still I find myself cringing a little bit in embarrassment when the child asks their parent to read it aloud. This line in particular is the one that gets me every time:""Sometimes it is fun to let- the milky make my face all wet.""Hmmmm..."
4,Recognizes breastfeeding as normal,"I bought this for my breastfed daughter's first Christmas. It's great to have a children's book that recognizes breastfeeding as normal. I'm sick of having to skip over books that show babies with bottles! I'm glad this book is here. The illustrations aren't top notch, but they're fine. Some of the prose is a bit forced, but again it's all worth it to have something so positive."
5,My toddler loves this book!,"This is the best children's book out there regarding breastfeeding. The pictures are great and really show the truth and beauty of the breastfeeding couple. The pictures illustrate how natural nursing is and that it is really done in just about any place, at anytime, by mothers around the world.My toddler loves this kid-sized book as it fits right into his little hands and he can easily carry it around with him. My older boy also enjoys looking at the pictures and remembering his nursing days. The other day I overheard him saying ""milk makes my tummy yummy, but mommy's milk is better"" as he poured himself a glass of cow's milk.A gem of a book for all!!"
4,A great recording; a good progression,"I really enjoyed this recording. It just seemed like a logical progression for the band. From their first album, ""Between Something and Nothing"", to their subsequent albums, they have grown and matured as musicians and songwriters. It was not what I expected from The Ocean Blue but that is what blows me away with each new recording of theirs. You can hear the old stuff/songs underneath each new song but the new ones definitely strike out on their own and make a name for themselves. I would recommend this to anyone who loves music."
5,Don't compare it to the others!,"I've been a fan of the Ocean Blue since I first heard the self-titled album. I was a fan of many different genres when I first heard them so I was very happy when See was released since it shows a different faze of their musical existence.I think you'd have to see them play this material live to understand that the band was playing something different as their lives evolve. This album reflects some of the ambience the show produced and I'm happy to hear David writing some diverse material.Don't compare See to earlier or later albums; listen to it as it's own identity and soak in the emotion on such tracks as Bitter, Behind and the soulful SLIDE! This album goes through a roller-coaster of dynamic sounds that should be listened to a few times in the summer. Drive and enjoy."
3,I didn't think it was that great,"Some people seem to be pretty excited by this album, but I wasn't, really. A few good songs, but to me the harder-edged sound and more sardonic mood isn't quite becoming to The Ocean Blue. I didn't even bother keeping this one; maybe it had something to do with the fact that I got rejected the same week I bought this, and didn't particularly want a memento!"
2,"Interesting, but save a few standout tracks, not enjoyable","Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work. The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound). And what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun? Just because Steve Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether. So, anyway, what does this album offer instead? Harder sounding guitar, angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you've had the CD for a couple weeks. Exceptions: ""Whenever You're Around"", and ""Slide"" are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production."
4,Cool comedy thriller,"I really liked this movie. Justin Berfield is always great and Robert Carridine was a likeable Dad. My favorite was the humorous villain, Mr X played by the British star Martin Jarvis. I loved him in Titanic and Buster and here he was different again - keen to dominate the world, just like a James Bond bad guy. Great fun - all our family loved it."
3,Typical kiddie fodder,"Were it not for Justin Berfield starring, I probably would have passed on this one. He is one of my favorite young actors though, so I gave it a view. The story was good and there was plenty of action; but the rest of the actors were only so-so. (Especially the girl who played the lifeguard; she seemed bored.) If you're a fan of Justin's work---check out the TV show ""Unhappily Ever After"". Justin is way funnier than his older brother on the show."
3,You Will Need a Stong Stomach and a Sense of Humor!,"I couldn't resist watching this movie. As a mermaid performer, I'm always interested in others' depictions of mermaids. If you can get past the gory bits,(and there are a lot of gory bits!) you may even discover a simple story line that is quite interesting. The special effects of the mermaid tail upon first encounter are actually quite lovely. Intriguing ending~ however, if you have a weak stomach- this may not be the movie for you.As for 'He never Dies', I actually found it to be quite amusing, once I had become a bit gore-numbed by the 'Mermaid' film."
5,Lost Souls of the Witches' Castle,"I absolutely loved the book. I read it in one seating. It ""fed"" the romantic part of my soul. It was written clearly so you could actually ""see"" the characters and places. I am from Massachusetts and I particularly enjoyed the mention of places I have visited. My only complaint is it wasn't long enough."
1,Author has a theory to sell,"It really seems that the author has a theory on soul mates and reincarnation and has chosen to use a novel to push it. The story was fine, but the writing was clunky and proselytizing. I finished the book because I wanted to know how it ended (though you didn't really have to guess), but skipped a lot of the dialogue.Also, the Kindle edition is poorly formatted, no ToC, blank pages and other idiosyncrasies, it's as though the transfer to digital didn't take into account that the text size might change."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,"I bought this book from an Amazon used book seller. I have been for several years an interested reader of anything that has to do with the Danvers Insane Asylum. Sorry, folks, this has nothing to do with Danvers. This has everything to do with a man and woman who meet at Danvers during a photo shoot of the photographer protganist, the man, who meets the woman, who happens to be a psychiatric nurse. Big deal.If you are an alcoholic, you will love this book. In almost all scenes of the so called ""love birds"" they have glasses of wine in their hands. They constantly ask each other in each scene, ""would you like a glass of wine?"" In every scene in this book, they are either drinking wine or toasting wine to each other. It's like, wine is the center of this book!A total waste of time reading this book. Danvers Insane Asylum deserves more than this total tripe!"
5,Chicken - Book,"Very insightful, it certainly has a deeper meaning than just the average ""For Rent"" Book. When I read the book, it was as if I was walking the streets, walking up the stairs or talking to certain people. It is written in a very catching and truthful way, nothing was made up, and the intimacy of it, for me it was an honor to read it and to relate.Thank you very much, dear Author!"
5,A treasure--mesmerizing,"Not since I read The Catcher in the Rye 20 years ago have I been so glued to a book. I bought this book on a Friday afternoon and couldn't put it down til I finished it Saturday afternoon. But this compelling coming-of-age story gripped me squarely in the vise of ""gunna""--I had to know what was ""gunna"" happen next. David Henry Sterry's sculpted language creates a visceral intensity, a three-dimensional roller coaster ride through the shocking, sad, and sometimes funny world of teenage prostitution. His childhood flashbacks add a richness to the story, capturing the family backstory in Super-8 sprocketed vignettes. The book was in equal parts gritty, enlightening, and engrossing. Sterry has exploded onto the literary landscape and may well be the voice of a generation of disenfranchised youth. Don't miss it."
3,easy read told with good humor,"I thought this book was very easy read because of the tongue-in-cheek style of the author and the brashness of the telling. My only complaint is that this book is not longer. I felt like I read a long story in a magazine.I thought his ""tricks"" were very interesting stories and I wanted to hear more of them.It's funny he thanks his parents at the end. By the end of the book we hate them. (or is it at the beginning?)If you liked this book Permanent Midnight by Jerry Stahl and Dry by Augusten Burroughs are even better.I hope this author writes more books and longer ones."
4,Chicken?!,Recently bought this book after reading a journal review about it. Found this book extremely interesting and poignant at the same time. The author approaches the subject matter with frank honesty which has to be commended. Would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in reading it.
3,OK,Quick reading. I glossed over the every other part about his childhood. could have been left out. The parts of his hustling weren't that graphic and he sure was an angry person. I've always known there are a lot of weird and kinky people out there.
1,Badly Done,"I thought this was going to be a biography first of all on Axl Rose, but everything I heard on here I already heard before on the internet or VH1's behind the music. Plus, there was no music or singing or talking footage at all of Axl. It was boring without any of that! This was very deceiving. On the DVD it says unauthorized by Axl and no original music included. It did not say that when I went to buy the DVD!!! If it had, I wouldn't have bought it. It sucks!"
1,Axl Rose?,"There is hardly any footage of Axl Rose himself, no Guns N Roses music, all in all sorry to say this DVD sucks."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I thought this would be more of a documentary of Axl and the band, especially, doing performances, which is what I really hoped for because they were my all-time favorite '80's rock band, and Axl was the BOMB!....but the movie was just about several peripheral people, managers etc, in interviews giving their accounts and opinions of Axl, etc. Only 1 very short, poorly shot scene of Axl on stage, and 1 short clip of him on the plane with Stephanie, but otherwise, really NO SHOTS OF AXL or the band ANYWHERE! This was a terrible disappointment. Really deserved NO stars!"
2,"Not firm, very loud, not very comfy.","When these arrived they were pancake flat, and while I shook and poofed and fluffed they never really filled out. When you lay on them your head just sinks to the bottom like in most cheap feather pillows. Ok so I thought now that I've opened the package and these things are mine I'll at least be able to use them as scrunch pillows and wad them up to make something somewhat supportive, but the feathers in the pillow make a loud crunching sound whenever bunching and shaping. BTW the packaging for the king pillow says 44oz of filling, not 45 like in the description. I certainly wouldn't buy these again if I had the chance."
1,Disappointed,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for family and as soon as we opened the box, we were disappointed. There they lay, these two SUPER FLAT, thin, inexpensive looking ""pillows""... Ok, so we tried fluffing them up. We wanted to give them a chance... They were just as flat, no matter what we did, and thin as you can imagine. The quality was average, but they were just too flat and thin. We felt that a down filled pillow should have some weight, some substance. We would have been embarrassed to give these as gifts. And we certainly would not use or enjoy them ourselves. I returned them immediately and went to a local retail store where I could feel the pillows. Hard to buy pillows online was our lesson. However, if you want a flat, thin down pillow, then perhaps you might rate them higher and enjoy them moreso."
3,SO SO,"THESE PILLOWS ARE NOT FIRM AND ARE QUITE HEAVY FOR A PILLOW. IF I USE BOTH OF THEM, THEY ARE THICK ENOUGH AND FIRM ENOUGH. GOOD PILLOWS, JUST WAS HOPING FOR A FIRMER SET."
1,Nothing like the picture AT ALL!,The picture is completely deceiving. The pillows are NOTHING like that at all. We are so disappointed and sorry we purchased them!
3,Jasper Premium Pillows,The order was received on time as for the fluffy medium firm pillow no.I would suggest ordering a firm pillow
1,jasper pillows,"I was very disappointed.They were not firm at all.Would not recommend to anyone looking for a firm pillow.I felt cheated when they arrived.Gave them to my daughter,she put them together to make one pillow."
1,BEWARE!,"Jasper Premium Two White Goose Down Pillow with Pillow in Pillow Design Med-Firm Pillows, King, Set of 2Jasper Premium Two White Goose Down Pillow with Pillow in Pillow Design-Set of 2 Med-Firm Pillows, king-20""x36""These are the flatest pillows I have ever seen! They look nothing like the picture and have very little stuffing in them! I had to return mine and would like to warn every one not to buy these!"
2,Too flat,"These pillows are not what I expected. The minute I looked at them, I knew I had been oversold by the product description. If you're thinking hotel pillows, these are not it!"
2,doesn't work with all it's compatibles,"the battery stuck out the back, the cover didn't fit. this is a disaster.but they shipped it ontime...2 stars"
2,This battery is erratic and unpredictable.,"This battery is erratic and unpredictable. It charges, but the resulting charge reads with an X, not bars, and charge often fades quickly."
4,great product great price,thanks to amazon for making it very affordable to purchase the things you need at competative prices.
2,Didn't charge as I wanted,"I didn't like this battery. After charging a long time it showed a big red ""X"" on the phone, which seemed to imply that there was a error (according to the phone's hardware). The battery did last longer than my previous one (which had lost capactiy due to memory, I think), but I'll buy the manufacturer's battery in the future to eliminate risk."
4,MotoQ Charger,The product arrived on time and works as mentioned. It really improved my battery life and having used it for 3 weeks I have not had to charge the phone as much. HIghly recommend the product and the seller.
4,good deal -,"good deal and value for offer on moto q - verizon store wanted 5 times the amount for battery alone.the only problem i have now is the phone never shows ""full charge"" when it is fully charged (I hope) and the phone battery icon doesn't show full charge (batery symbol and a x) until i turn off and turn on again."
4,Good Deal For The Money.,"This battery has much better life than the battery that come with the Q.I would say you can do twice as much talking, surfing, texting, etc. while charging it about as often.There are higher Mah batteries available for the Q, but they cost $49-$59, so for $13 or so this is a pretty good deal.The only downside (and maybe I just didn't read description well enough) is that the battery door is silver, which looks dorky on my black Q."
4,It's a terrific book.,"Avatars is about the connection between the history of the written word and the upcoming of the increase in Internet technology and cyberspace. The book explains how the written word is being challenged by cyberspace and what cyberspace may look like in the future. O'Donnell is a very witty writer, who keeps the attention of the reader. Writing about the Internet can get tedious, but O'Donnell keeps an interesting style of writing for the reader."
1,"all messed up, missing so many other songs","Well music and rock fans - need help on this one. Where is the rest of the rock groups songs that performed? This internet rock show was as big as Live 8 back in 2005, maybe even bigger. Some bands had played several songs, not one or two. Will there be a part 2,3 or 4 to this Live Earth concert? This is why it gets a single star. So much is left out - plus it does not even say if it is unrated, do not want cut songs. The music on this is wonderful - however so much is left out. For example, Linkin Park had maybe up to ten songs or close to that number. Unhappy and unclear about this, where do we look and go from here to locate missing concert music?"
1,Too Much Talking - Too Little Music,So much of the music was left off this DVD it staggers the mind. This DVD seems to be 60% talk and 40% music. Many of the performances were cut short leaving me irritated beyond belief. Live 8 is a superior offering.
1,YAY SNOW PATROL!!,Who's bright idea was it to include one song from almost each popular artist on this? This should be called Live 8 my wallet
3,madonna fan,"i agree with most reviewers, 1 song from every performer and many left out? HEY YOU on cd but not on dvd? u would think that HEY YOU, being a specially written song and performance 4 the event, wouldve at least made the dvd 1 song live perfomance cut, instead of the bordello version of LA ISLA BONITA! really!"
1,annoying,"This dvd is like a tribute to Al Gore with alot of talk about saving the earth (now since Live 8 has stamped out poverty).Very annoying political statements about how to save energy etc at menu sites on dvd. Most of the songs sucked also. There are some good groups on dvd but bad songs and irritating comments, like so and so is a great American? This dvd certainly will not heat up the enviornment save money and buy an air conditioner instead"
3,Not much fun for my daughter,"I know every child is different so to be fair, I won't say this is a bad toy. I'll just say that this toy held my daughter's interest from the opening of the box until about 5 minutes later and no matter how many times I have tried to engage her with it, she may play with a part of it for a few minutes but always always moves on. This is one of those toys again where for such a big toy (it's not huge but it is reasonably sized), I feel it should do a heck of a lot more than it does and I guess my daughter agrees. There are random 'flowers' etc that exist that have no point but to wobble. Really? The other parts that are educational are okay but it's just really not engaging. I found the singing heads that sing ""pa pa pa"" or ""ba ba ba"" strange sounding.I'm sorry I bought this only since it has never done much for us!"
2,What's the big deal ?,"After reading the other reviews, I thought this would be a great battery operated toy for my 11 month old. But, she has displayed little more than a passing interest in it and quite frankly it seems boring as far as toys go. The other two salient parent points are that 1)the ""sounds/songs"" it makes are not pleasing,( compared to the learn and grove table which sounds nice), but rather sounds like an annoying video game ( I think I'll get my fill of those sounds when she older, why subject myself to it now?) and 2) as mentioned in other reviews the balls just roll away, so you ( the parent) have to go search under the sofa for them...like I need more work to do!"
4,Strange toy...but my son loves it!,"We received this toy as a hand-me-down. I would not agree with the box and say the age range is 6-36 months. A 3 year old would definitely be bored with this toy. I think an appropriate range would be 9-18 months.When we received this toy, my first thought was, ""What the heck is this?"" It is really strange looking. However, my son just LOVES it. The songs are annoying, but I will put up with them if they make my son happy, which they do. He has figured out, though, that he can get the toy to count without dropping the Brightlings balls down the chute...he sits there happily with his hand at the bottom of the chute, pushing down the landing pad so the toy will count. He figured that out at 10 months, so there is no way this toy will keep his attention too much longer. Great toy, but I wouldn't spend the amount of money on it that Amazon wants!"
3,What exactly is it's purpose?,"I bought this toy based on all of the attention and good reviews it was receiving last Christmas. It was predicted to be one of the hottest toys for toddlers! I knew virtually nothing about it, but I was expecting to be impressed.Out of the box, the toy looks unique and very interesting. However, upon sampling its capabilities, I'm not quite sure what the point is. Maybe the one we received was defective, but the slider for the ABC's does nothing but sing the ABC song, regardless of which letter it is on. My daughter has gotten a little enjoyment out of the toy--mostly from the strange sounds that the little creatures make. But, overall, it is largely ignored.This toy simply doesn't seem to do much and offers very few educational benefits. However, it is very durable. My daughter has thrown it from the toy box on several occasions to get to a toy of greater interest, and it still works and looks like new."
5,My Brightlings Exploration Station Review,"My niece needs help on her motor skills and I wanted to get her a toy that when she pushed something, or moved something there would by some type of reaction...ie a sound, or light, or something moving. I found all of that with this toy. It really is perfect for her and keeps her occupied for hours! Not only that, my 3 year old nephew, who doesn't have special needs, loves it just as much. Thank you and keep up the good work!!"
1,not age appropriate,"this toy has small parts and states clearly ""for children over 3yrs old"". however, it is clearly marketed toward babies 9months and up! the picture on the advertisement is of a little toddler clearly not 3 or even 2 years old! not to mention that most of the reviews are from parents getting this toy for their pre-3yr old child. i wouldn't be surprised if this toy was recalled soon."
5,Tales from the Mom Front,"This is an outstanding book. Unpretentious, hillarious stories, from a mom who is brave enough to tell the truth!!!"
5,"Knee Slappin', Log Splittin' Hilarity","After hearin' this CD a record 450 times in Avalon, I still drip in my pants every time I hear the one about the lawnmower...It's great when your bowlin' with Herb or just drinkin' JB with Philly slobs...Josty does a great imitation of the big hick in the lawnmower skit...It's so funny...This CD is for you! Gimme two smacks across the mouth and I'll give you mine..."
3,no compulsory...,"This is hard bop as hundreds we've heard (the sidewinder by Lee Morgan, Art Blakey's Blue Notes, etc. Very good stuff indeed, but sometimes a bit aging...). As for ""consequence"", I bought the disc on account of the review below, thinking that the session would be as unforgettable as ""Let Freedom Ring"", ""Destination Out"" or ""It's Time !"". But, sorry, ""Consequence"" is no compulsory and you won't suffer any consequences if you don't purchase it. The musicians play great, but I still don't understand why Jackie recorded that stuff back then in 1965. I might be wrong, but to me, it's a mere commercial record he'd made to increase the sales of Blue Notes. I know that bop and hard bop are very famous these days, but it's high time people listened to other stuff too."
5,love it,I just love gundam wing its my altime fave anime. i have almost the hole searys i only need 3 more movies. I think you should buy this if your a gundam wing fan.Because i thought this one was a very good one.
3,"WORTHY UPGRADE FOR THE 9X EDITIONS, BUT NOT FOR THE 2000 ED.","""Microsoft FrontPage"" is a full-featured Web design software. The highlights of this 2002 Upgrade include: being easy to use (with the help of additional Wizards and Templates); being able to integrate and correlate with compatible applications; and having a reliable usage-analysis-report. Also, both the 'Auto Web Content' and the 'b-Central Commerce Manager' live up to their respective billings. But despite these facts, Microsoft still has some catching-up to do. This latest 'FrontPage' lack most of the features that make Macromedia's 'Dreamweaver' tick. Again, ardent frontpagers will notice that only a thin line separates this 2002 version from the 2000 version. As a result, I don't regard it as a worthy Upgrade for FrontPage 2000. It is better reserved for FrontPage 9X edition users."
3,marginally better than Publisher 2002 but still no upgrade,"After creating a fairly nice OS called Windows XP, Microsoftthen messed up the relatively decent applications Publisher andFront Page. I will grant FrontPage2002 is less messed up thanMSPub. The registration scheme is a joke. When you crash yourdrive after using BOTH installs for your desktop and laptopsyou will see what I mean because you have had your installs andthey feel you should pay again. Still the editor is WYSIWYG andI use this esp when I am working to produce lots of pagesquickly."
3,good and bad,"This is a good program to get a website up and running. If you use a previous version, it is definitely worth your money to upgrade to 2002. Too bad they didn't fix the most annoying thing about frontpage. Under many options in their menus, there are still no modules to choose from. Just blank windows. Why bother putting these unfilled choices in there? Examples: DHTML Effects...none, Macros...none, Addins...none. Do they really expect me to create these first? Everything at my website that is awesome has nothing to do with frontpage."
2,Is upgrading to FP 2002 worth the money,"FP 98, by far, is the best, and fastest HTML editor - although, it doesn't have all the whistles and bells of FP 2000 or FP 2002.FP 2000 very sluggish. Using it is like typing in the ""hunt & peck"" method.Using Dreamweaver eliminates the needs for the .htm extensions in web addresses.Which way to go? My humble opinion is to stay with FP98 and learn HTML & XML for editing the code."
2,No Support and Instructions Incorrect,"I am very dissatisfied with FrontPage 2002 support, its contained Help option and the ""manual"" that came with it. I e-mailed a question to Microsoft and a very polite rep responed promptly. He wrote a full page telling me that support was not provided beyond installation. He wrote a fulll page to tell me this, and my question, that he did not answer, could have been answered in four sentences. Further, the information provided in the poorly written very small manual and the Help in the program have been flat incorrect on at least two occasions. Instructions to perform a couple of routine functions are incorrect and will not work. You're on your own when you buy this."
4,"FP 2002 - Best yet, but with bugs.","I've used every version of Front Page since 97 in my web development business. Miscrosoft keeps adding nice bells and whistles to the tool, and I keep using it more than I used to. Normally, I use it in conjunction with Dreamweaver. Both can do things the other can't do, and Dreamweaver has stopped ruining my Front Page code. The big surprise for me was that MS totally blew some of the DHTML functions in 2002, so I am forced to use 2000, which I keep on another computer, for those functions. The work-arounds are a pain. Not bad overall tho."
1,"Very Hard to Use, Unlike Earlier Versions","This is the classic example of software sprawl. This program is a space hog, taking up more and more of your hard drive, and more and more of your RAM. In return, you get sales pitches for, and links to, other Microsoft products. If you like Front Page, which I do, stick with the old version. The new version will slow you down, and waste your time."
4,Well,"The problems I see other people having are because they don't know other ways of doing things (like using the keyboard for copying and pasting and who knows why they aren't logging directly into the site and making real-time changes for just one page). The other programs mentioned are not always compatible with other browsers. FrontPage had this problem but as website publishers ourselves, we haven't had a single problem with the HTML compatibility that FP provides. As far as FP competing with other programs...if you don't think that it competes you don't know how to use it.I agree with the long wait times and the server extensions seem to go corrupt more than usual once you do get them installed. The forms could have more functions and the themes are so problem forming that we do not even use them. FP is also no longer available for MACs; this could lead to HTML compatibility problems in the future just like there were in the past."
3,Amazingly disappointing!,"As usual, Microsoft's fanfare at this product's release does not live up to it's reality. There are similar products priced less that do at least as much with less difficulty. If you do upgrade to this product, don't let it overwrite your previous versions ..you might find that your webpage no longer functions like it did."
2,Buyer beware--NO support from MS,"While Frontpage 2002 is a fine upgrade, buyer beware! When I tried to use no-fee web based e-mail support to ask a simple question about FP 2002's functionality, I was met with the message, ""You do not qualify for free support."" MS tells me they have changed their policy. Only in American can you buy a product for nearly... and NOT get support. Argh!"
3,"Oh, come on you guys, it's not that bad . . . .","So many of the reviews for this product have been whining and complaining basically because Frontpage does not directly interface with your brain. Common guys, for the price, this one's pretty good. Granted, I am not a ""pro"", but I have been stuck using FP 98 until recently! I was still having problems with my system locking up and having to run two or three programs just to create a page. This version has not yet locked up my system and I have been able, with a small amount of effort, how to use tables and links, etc. For me, this version is easier and quicker to use. I have noticed only one really quirky issue: When replacing a graphic after altering it in Image Composer, I find I must shut FP down and reopen the page in order to get the program to refresh the image from the newly saved location. A short cut around this problem is to never save the graphics with the exact same name, I suppose. Minor glitch for an otherwise easy to use program."
3,more stable maybe?,"well, it looks a little better, seems a bit more stable, but for the most part, not reall worth the upgrade from fp2000. use that money and get a real frontpage enabled host. that you can control (not the freebe sites)"
2,Not worth the upgrade if you aren't using IIS,"I bought this thinking it would allow me better user management, but discovered that most of the upgraded features from FP 2000 are for IIS users only. If you're using Apache, don't bother with this upgrade."
4,A necessary upgrade to the second best web design tool.,"I have used FrontPage since it first came out and have a love/hate relation with it. It made design easy but writes bad, incompatible code. FP2000 fixed a lot of this but the user interface was redesigned and is now terrible. FP2002 fixes the things they got wrong in the earlier versions and is now what is should have been already. I will definately upgrade, since the site management capabilities are great and there are new features definitely worth having. But as far as what is best, I give Dreamweaver top ratings. The suite of tools from Macromedia (Dreamweaver, UltraDev, Fireworks, Flash, and Freehand) is superb and can't be beat."
1,EULA,"Read the End User License Agreement before you even think of using this software. I couldn't believe my eyes. MS has placed limits in the End User License Agreement on the type of information that you can publish using their software.

5,This is a MUST HAVE!! SOTT movie and cd...,"Top of the line...a must have for sure for any Prince fan. And any music enthusiast must see it also. The coverage of the live perfomances is excellent. Prince really delivers an excellent job and makes me think of how AWESOME a live US tour would have been to promote his Sign O The Times ablum. From Sign O The Times to Hot Thing, this vhs rocks! The VHS quality is reminiscent of the vhs quality, but very clear to watch and alot of fun. Will keep you dancing!!!"
4,An essential title for the Prince fan,"This is a great title! Prince is absolutely at the top of his form in this concert film, a chronical of his Sign O' The Times European tour in 1987. Essential for Prince fans, and enjoyable for all (Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs up!)."
1,Horrible,The dvd didn't work at all and it would have been too much hassle for me to send it back then wait to get my money back since I'm in a war zone. Never again
1,WARNING! Not an official version of the film,"This is a Brazilian DVD that is a lame copy of the original film on VHS tape. This is not an official release. Scenes are missing, the picture quality is dark and it's not even in stereo. You're better off buying the VHS tape - at least that's the real deal and better quality. That said, this movie rocks! Just don't buy this DVD..."
2,THIS IS NOT A BOOTLEG,"I have read several reviews that talk about just how poor the quality is of this dvd and how bad the packaging is. To clear up a few misunderstandings, number one: This is not a bootleg. This DVD is an import from Brazil. In Brazil, they have different copyright laws and the packaging is the sole responsibility of the manufacturer (which I don't believe is Wanner Bros. or MCA). If you're a well seasoned Prince fan, then I'm sure you've seen countless promotional posters for concerts in years such as 1995, with 1985 pictures on them. This is very common outside of the United States. As far as owning this DVD as a ""Must Have,"" buy it at your own risk; but don't blame Amazon. Amazon is actually doing die hard fans a favor by making this DVD available. Left in the hands of Wanner Brothers, we probably wont see another Prince DVD until long after he's gone."
2,Sign O' the Times-the DVD,"Let me start off by saying that I gave this disk 2 stars because it is Prince. beyond that, i highly recommend that you pass this one up.After waiting since early February, I finally got it today(April 10th). I expected problems when all the packaging was in spanish with a different cover picture. i put it into my player, and that's where the real dissapointment came in. The picture is awful. The sound is awful. the so-called dolby digital sound came mostly from my center channel speaker. I had to actually walk over to my other speakers to see if anything at all was coming out of them(very little). The quality of the sound is also awful(muffled). I pulled out my old VHS copy that i was hoping to retire, and it is far superior even after 15 or mor years of heavy use. Do not buy this disk unless you are just looking for disappointment."
2,subpar import from brazil,"I wont spend too much time on a review of this dvd version. I will say that if you have this on vhs, stick with it and wait. This import edition is far inferior to the vhs in both video and audio quality. If you must have this on dvd, then buy at your own risk. I'll just watch my vhs version until Warner wakes up"
1,Don't be fooled - this is NOT the genuine article,"I excitedly ordered this from the UK because I have longed for this to come out on DVD for years. Frankly, you'd be far better off ordering the existing VHS edition from the US, which i already have. This DVD was not recorded in the US (I think Brazil) and whoever has committed it to DVD has basically just lifted the VHS tape onto a disc. The sound and visual quality is therefore even poorer than the VHS edition and to say I am very disappointed is an extreme understatement. I will be sending my copy back tomorrow and I can't believe that an organisation of such usual high quality as Amazon is stocking this without explanatory notes. When is someone finally going to recognise that this film deserves proper re-mastering treatment and re-release? It is, after all, Prince's finest hour and the best live performance film I have ever seen. Very upset indeed."
3,confused.....song list on this release????,"I absolutely love this concert film, and have not purchased this dvd yet. I am puzzled that in all of the previous reviews there was no mention of the songlist difference from the original film. Unless the packaging is incorrect, the set list is different from the film I saw in the theatre and later on VHS. That version began with the title cut, and also included ""The Cross"". Neither of these titles appear on the DVD's songlist.Any thoughts, anyone???Thanks"
5,How ... can you get!!!,"Prince never fails to give a fantastic performance! It was perfect. I loved the roleplay to each song, very sexy and well planned. The sets were also fantastic. and, i've got to say that the show also gave out a dominating note from the ladies in performance. Sheila E was fantastic on drums or as Prince would say, "" Not bad, for a girl!"" A must buy!"
4,Leave Subtitles OFF!!...,"I have been a die-hard Prince fan ever since Controversy. This DVD is decent quality but it seems as if it was ripped from VHS. A few skips... but the Subtitles were done by an individual that is obviously not a Prince fan. The words are so way off base on many instances. The quality of the DVD does give it a ""Concert Feel"" though. Most of this was shot in Paisley Park <or so I have heard> but the fact the quality is not exaclty DVD kind of gives it an ""authentic"" feel. But the subtitles are sooo far off base on many instances. I know this because I know every word 2 every Prince song,, B sides and all. But being that u can not get this released by WB yet,,, it is good. Die hard fans go 4 it,, novices that like him during Purple Rain years u may be let down. But Die-harders,, go 4 it. The guy is STILL phenomenal and I still feel no one can hold a candle 2 him."
3,"""an under rated concert masterpiece""",An overlooked concert movie that exemplifies the craftmanship Prince possesses as a musician and a performer. The Hendrix-like guitar riffs combined with the funky bass lines makes this a treasure to anyone who remembers or wants to know what the true prince of rock and funk was about.
4,Decent for those just learning about AD/HD,"I bought this book but ended up returning it as it did not present me with much information that I didn't already know, and that which I didn't I could find on the internet. This is coming from someone who's read other books, researched academic studies, and had many conversations with AD/HD friends and specialists.However, I do think it would be a decent book for someone new to the subject. I especially like how it covers the neurology of the disorder, and that it has an up-to-date section on drugs used to help treat ADHD. I also very much appreciated that the book doesn't insult my dignity with cutesy cartoons and ""you're OK!"" fluff the way books on these kinds of disorders tend to do. The section dealing with self-diagnosis - what ADHD is and isn't - is great too. Would make a good read for those living and dealing with us!All in all this is a concise little book with up-to-date information on the basics of AD/HD."
5,Scattered Minds.,Who would have thought an adult diagnosis of ADHD.Read it for yourself or to understand the possible struggles that others may be experiencing. It opened my eyes to my personal concerns and offered insight into the potential reasons for the confusing behavior's of others; in all social enviroments and relationships.
5,A Resource for Hope in a Dark Time,"The book jacket warns you to keep your tissues handy, but this is much more than a teary rendition of a personal struggle with cancer. Heather Jose challenges the reader to question everything from your initial diagnosis to your involvement in treatment to your personal strength and faith. Her letters to her daughter of less than one year are the vehicle that shape a much more detailed recipe for any cancer patient. Read this if you don't know what to do ... give this book to anyone you know facing cancer. It is a source of hope AND a guide to what to do."
4,Interesting and fun,"This little book contains ten colorful temporary tattoos depicting a wide array of swampland animals. There's a giant American alligator, a mud snake on a branch, a spotted turtle, and a spotted alligator. There are two birds, a purple heron and a flying wood duck, and two fish, a bluegill sunfish and a redfin shiner. There are even a couple of insects, a dragonfly and a tiger swallowtail butterfly. There is a conspicuous absence of frogs and mammals, but the animals here are well drawn and realistic in style. These little books make great treats for young friends or for yourself."
4,good read,"This book was well written, good dialogue, the good characterization...I'd recommend it over a lot of other books that are out there--its also very compact, you don't feel that there is a lot of extraneous info, and the pace is well set..."
3,What do you get,"when you cross a Confederate Soldier, three college students, and a retiring professor? Mr. Sweeney who recently purchased an old house and lost his mother is adjusting to life by himself. When two strangers approach his doorstep and wonder where the Doucet's have gone, a complicated arcane mystery starts to unfold."
2,Extremely slow start,"This book follows three different stories at three different points in time. I realize it takes a while to get the historical lay of the land and plot set, but I was about done with the book before the points converged enough for the plot to get interesting. I received a free copy of the book for review purposes and, frankly, if I hadn't been required to finish it, I would have stopped reading before it got good.I normally like this genre and the plot lines were good, just very slow to develop."
3,"AUDIO SUPERCEDED BY 2006 ""COLLECTED"" IMPORT","This 1997, 2CD set offered the first remastering of the Cale catalog.While the mastering on this set is excellent, the 2006 release of the 3CD, 60-track, importCollectedone-ups Anthology in both the amount of material and audio departments.If you're a true Cale fan, you will probably be stunned at the mastering on the Collected set, it's that good.16 of the 50 Anthology tracks do not appear on Collected, so this set may be worth hanging on to. However, owning Collected is an absolute must."
4,This is the source. Start here.,"This is the man that makes it look easy. You could do a lot worse than to cover a J.J. Cale song. Clapton has.Mark Knopfler learned every lick, every trick of phrase he knows from Mr. Cale.Here's the real deal, where it all comes from. If you're just starting, this is the set to get."
4,I like it more with each listening,The reviews turned out to be true! I felt the same as another reviewer who couldn't believe he had gone so long without getting acquainted with J. J. Cale. The very definition of laid-back music.
2,"Buy ""Okie"" instead","First off let's dispense with the packaging. The writing is inane, the photos look like a bad tv ad from the 90s. (an abandoned gas station, all rust and tumbleweed, Cale posed as ever-so-""americana"" scruff. Please.) Cale IS a terrific musician, and an essential listen, but you'll be better served by ""Okie"" or any of his albums. This anthology misses Cale's genius entirely, choosing an endless series of same tempo shuffles. A listen to Okie reveals a very varied set of songs that flow easily and present an entire world of textures and rythmns. Cale is a studio wizard, related more to Brian Eno than to the lesser talents (like Clapton) who imitate his innovations. He arranges his recordings very carefully, as engineers are wont to do, and it is all about the sequencing and layering of sounds and meaning. Taken out of context, Cale's songs can seem slight and repetitious. So skip this ill-advised collection and buy any of the albums instead."
2,Not very good,"My exercise group agreed with me that it wasn't much fun to listen to. It had the beat ok, but that's about it."
5,Just Awsome,"This tape is the just the best!Episode 1: Sakura opens the Clow Book and sets the Cards free, now she must beome a Card Captor and Captor the Fly card!Episode 2: Sakura's friend Tomoyo finds out about Sakura being a Cardcaptor and decides to tape and give costumes for all of her missions. After school, they go back to find out that the Shadw card is trying to detroy them!Episode 3: Sakura goes to the aquariuim and finds out that the Watery card is there. Kero says none of her cards can defeat it. But whatt if people's lives are on the line?Episode 4: Sakura has to do the chores whenshe is attacked by the Wood and Rain cards. Can she seal them both in one episode?This is great, but do not buy the dub, it's terrible."
2,A Real Disappointment for the Japanese Fans of CC Sakura,"Sure this video shows the first episodes, but its not the same Cardcaptor Sakura that they edited and cut up over a million times! The voices are okay, i'd have to admit that, but they've changed the character personalities, and to boot it all up, they've also changed how a few of the episodes go. The episodes are shown OUT OF ORDER!Still, I'd have to say that if you're just starting out, this is recommended (considering that you may or may not understand Japanese^_^) , but remember, this is not the same Cardcaptor Sakura that is it supposed to be...Cherry Fields--My own Cardcaptors site. Get some more information on the series here if you're starting."
2,Come on People!,"This is what I hate about the video and what I like about the video.What I like about it:Doesnt Have Cut ScenesWhat I hate about it:Its In JapaneseNot Great StorylineYou can get it if you want, but I like the english version."
5,Very Appealing Anime,I'm a avid anime viewer but I prefer Shoujo anime. This is pretty cute even though it's not Sailor Moon. But I'd give it 5 stars and all my support! Many good shows are disappearing from TV better purchase DVDs while in stock!
4,Much more entertaining than cardcaptors.,I recommend this show for shoujo anime fans. This show isn't as dirty as most anime. Quite cute and a nice alternative to Shonen. Tired of more nudity than girl issues. Watch this. I thought Shoujo was for Chicks not guys. I'm tired of seeing naked chicks. This is pretty good for the fans of the North American version of Sailor Moon.
5,I love Cardcaptor Sakura Not Cardcaptors,There are a few things i like about it and dislike about itIts not available in EnglishI like to Watch it in both langugesMy Favorite thing about it isNo cuts and its Rated 13+ Not the kiddy version shown on tv
4,Cute..,"I bought this DVD for my niece who saw the American series and really fell in love with it. As she went on-line to learn more about the series, she saw that there were some edits and was dying to see the real series. As I sat down to watch with her, I became a little intrigued as well.Sakura is a cute series without going overboard. I expected something along the lines of ""Sailor Moon"" and was pleasantly surprised to find a good storyline, with refreshing and funny characters. The only part that was a little frustrating was the art itself, being a little on the basic side compared to some of the other series that I've seen. Other than that, this is a great series, and is a must for any child who enjoys Cardcaptor.P.S. - Don't let the purists drive you away from the American series, both are enjoyable in their own respects."
5,Great video,"This video starts the Card Captors saga, and it does it very well. The characters are well-drawn, and interesting. There are a few very funny moments, and a lot of jokes that might just get a smile. It is in Japanese, with English subtitles, which might discourage some people who don't want to read their movies, but at least the lips match. :P Besides, maybe a younger child will be able to practice reading while watching a great video."
5,The original is the best.,"Previous reviews have mentioned how badly edited the americanversion""CardCaptors"" is.It's all true.The first 7 episodes have been left out and the editing may as well have been done with a chainsaw.Admittedly,some content had to be left out(Sakura's friend Tomoyo(Madison)has a crush on her,and one of Sakura's classmates,Rika(Rita)has a crush on their homeroom teacher MrTerada.).Regardless,the original is worth the price to see the series in it's unadultered form."
1,yuck,"Sorry, but I'm a dub fan. This DVD only has the japanese language track, and let me tell ya, it gave me a headache. All the characters sounded the same. Their voices were uber annoying. I don't understand why people watch subs only."
4,Almost the best,"From what I can see Acustico MTV is not the best album ever performed by Titas, but, almost the best.... Anyway it's a good begining for those who want to listen or to know the true titas, with all power of the 80's band that I have saw. Better, there is the Arnaldo Antunes presence, the great....Arnaldo...."
3,Entertaining but Inconsistent,"I pulled out my Bible while watching Samson & Delilah. There were several inconsistencies and the order of some events were completely wrong. Samson seemed very weak. He was straining to lift things that he shouldn't have had a problem with and even though they didn't show him lifting the city gates, it would seem ironic that he could do that by himself, but strain to lift up an average sized man.I found this film a bit dissappointing, especially after watching Joseph. I began to collect the entire Bible Collection set and Samson & Delilah was my second.If you are looking for a video to rely on completely to display Bible truth, this is probably not the video for you."
1,Brother!!,"Am I the only one that thinks Samson's life would have been at least slightly dramatic? This movie slacks off on everything so much that the scene where he supposedly kills a thousand guys I think he probably kills five. And he struggls against the woosy prince of Philistia. The movie doesn't even show him taking the gate of gaza; but it sure does show the prostitutes in his life. I said the movie slacks off on everything maybe I shouldn't have said that. It doesn't seem to slack off much on his sex. For crying out loud this is supposed to be Christian. Oh and also it definitely isn't biblical the story is so messed up the only real similarity between it and the Bible is the names. Oh and I'm sorry, but this move doesn't need the part on Samson's circumcision either."
2,The Weakest of the Bible Collection,"I was gravely disappointed with Samson & Delilah. I found the story lagging (one tape would have sufficed) with many biblical inaccuracies including odd characters of no biblical origin. Additionally, I thought Dennis Hopper was horribly miscast. His dry way of speaking seemed too distracting.Although Eric Thal protrays a pensive Samson, the war between Samson's lust and his passion for God was not at all believable. His period of serving as a judge seemed more like a trist. Admittedly, I enjoyed Elizabeth Hurley as Delilah (I think this is some of her best work anywhere). In my opinion, you'd do best to pass on this video."
4,Mostly Accurate,"Samson killed infinitely more Philistines with the jawbone and columns and carried their city gate miles, but I guess they just didn't have the budget to visualize it. The acting is what's important and they succeed here. Samson was a guy who just didn't fit in with the guys and became too much the ladies man. Things would have gone so much better if he had only stayed with Israelite women."
3,Sexualy graphic,"The movie was ok and kind of followed the Bible but too much sexually graphic scenes that did not need to be there to get the message across,,,not a movie for younger children to watch..."
2,Bad movie..sent me 1 copy too many.,The movie sucked..long boring..tv movie and I got (and paid for )1 copy too many.
2,Terrible,"Of all the movies I have seen from the Bible collection, this is by far the worst in my opinion. Horrible, horrible acting, pretty bad casting (I will blame the director more than the actors), bad battle scenes, not completely accurate, and poor production. I almost stopped watching it, but I was hoping it would get better, but unfortunately, it didn't. Luckily, I watched Abraham right afterwards, and I was thoroughly impressed with that. Like night and day."
3,It's OK,"This movie is the story of Samson and Delilah. Samson was born to a barren couple of Israel and destined to help free his people from the hand of the Philistines who had overrun their country. But Samson had a weakness and this was women. He also had another, and this was his temper. The Philistines figured this out and used his weaknesses against him. First with his first wife and then again with Delilah.The movie, for me, moved a bit slow. I felt they spent time on aspects that they didn't need to and this bogged the movie down. The acting was ok here. I felt the direction was lacking also. I expected this movie, even for a made for TV movie, to have a lot more life and spark and it just didn't. I was a bit disappointed.I will say, and this came as a surprise, this movie had a young Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a young Samson and that was interesting to see."
2,Inaccurate,"I am a big fan of the Bible Series, Moses, Jacob and David are great movies, a little inaccurate at times but nothing mayor, however Samson and Delilah it's very inaccurate, for instance it completely forgot the part in which Samson offers honey to his parents (to show disobedience) or when Samson asks permission to his parents to marry a Philistian woman. This movie in relation to all others doesn't contain a message but rather its an attempt to make a biblical story a commercial one."
2,Overdrawn and innacurate,"A big mistake to make this movie three hours long. There is certainly not enough details in scripture to warrant such a decision. Therefore there were many made up scenes and long, painful conversations that have no scriptural basis. Had it been shorter and stuck to the point this might have been saved but otherwise its just too much of a narrative to be considered seriously."
3,Andrew Lloyd Webber on Broadway,I have found this CD to be somewhat disappointing. The songs sung by the various artists does not appearto live up to the standards of an Andrew Lloyd Webber production. The one song I like was sung by BarbraStreisand. The lyrics sung by other vocalists is just Ok.I ordered the CD because it was Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.
2,CD review,"This is a collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs, sung by a variety of lesser talents. They are credible performers, but the renditions do not do justice to his work, except in one or two instances when the performers are the ones who made the work famous, like Streisand. Not very good or very interesting."
4,splended,This is one of the greatest c.d.'s of all time! I'm almost fifteen and love Broadway musicals. I've found this one extravagant and I'm sure you will to!!!!!!!!!
1,"Not the original artists,pretty bad. Don't repeat my mistake","I wasn't paying enough attention that Amazon gave me an 'alternate recommendation' when I was searching for the real album of these tracks: ""The Premier Collection, Andrew Lloyd Webber"" And now I can't send it back. Don't repeat my error. Get the original ! Scott"
5,like,My wife likes this music and she listens to this in the car when she is driving around and out of town.
3,"The sale was fine, The content is outstanding, Cd scratched","All went well with the sale but I was dissapointed that the CD has a scratch on it and garggels and skips through my favorite song. I actually bought the CD for this one song. But I bought it ead cheap and used so I understand you get what you get.The content is wonderful. I love Weber and the song choices are great. Happy humming/whistling music for Bway fans, that's for sure."
4,"Some GREAT TUNES, plus some real JUNK!","Thankfully, this has the definitive version of Sarah B. singing DONT CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA, surely among the finest recordings of all time! Truly Inspirational! On the junk side, the first song SUPERSTAR must be among the trashiest ever recorded! In between, mostly reasonably good, with a nice sample from about every Webber musical! History will show that the Lloyd Webber songs surely do not rank among the all time great musical tunes, but the introduction of SARAH BRIGHTMAN more than makes up for this very uneven song catalogue."
5,Exploring the deeper meaning of katas to gain insights,"Written by a martial artist of 25 years' experience who has studied and practiced Isshin Ryu, Bando, Judo, and Boxing, Kata And The Transmission Of Knowledge teaches the reader about the deeper meaning behind ritual forms and pre-arranged fighting techniques known as katas. Chapters foster a better understanding of katas as means to transmit successful techniques from one generation to the next; the author scrutinizes katas that have been used in Greek, Egyptian, Asian, African and European societies since ancient times. Exploring the deeper meaning of katas to gain insights into the views and ethics of societies from which they originated, Kata And The Transmission Of Knowledge is especially recommended for martial artists seeking to better understand the nuances, purpose, history, and applications of the skills they pursue."
2,"Interesting ideas, not much else","The book was ok, it had a few interesting ideas on development of martial arts and martial culture, but not particularly well written."
5,Best One Yet!,"Mr. Rosenbaum,I have enjoyed all your books but this is the Best One Yet. You keep getting better as a writer and the addition of the drawings adds another dimension.I am hoping there is another one in the works.-An Avid Reader"
3,Bland,"I am enrolled in a masters level quantitative finance program and we use this text for an intro class. I found the portfolio management sections to be pretty good and the bonds and derivatives sections to be pretty weak. Furthermore, the important information in the book does not seem to clearly presented; you really have to dig through the text to get the relevant points. I guess all the important stuff is in the book, it's just hard to find. The book is big on theory and small on practical application. True, there are problems at the end of each chapter, but the chapters often don't provide clear enough explanation of the concepts to solve them adequately.Overall, it wasn't bad. It just wasn't great either."
3,Good for the price.,"Pretty simple & easy to work with. I had problems with lighting for a while, pictures turned out VERY DARK. Finally, I found the setting that fixed this problem... now pictures are way better. It really doesn't take good pictures in the dark, but you can make the picture out if you're on the right setting. Camera is nice overall, and very light weight, which is a pretty good thing. This is a good priced camera, but you are getting what you pay for. If you're not too serious about your pictures, and just need something at a good price; this camera is for you! (:"
1,It's not like I expected it to be good,"All I wanted was a cheap digital camera. I understood that for the price, I would have to sacrifice quality. But, really, when the box says ""16MB of internal memory"" I expect it to take pictures without paying for a memory card. When the box comes with a USB cable, I expect my computer to detect it... at all... ever.I had a digital camera ten years ago that eventually broke. The camera, back then, cost $50. It wasn't very good, even by ten years ago's standards... but guess what? I had fond, nostalgic memories of how good the picture quality was, how good the display was, and how great it was to use my old, cheap, obsolete camera."
1,Bluegrass Karaoke,"The music sound good but poor lyrics, cannot even see the words. Basically you have to memorize the words. I think they should redo the lyrics, make it bigger. Some part is not even highlighted."
3,Don't pay too much for office productivity,"MS Office is great, but it's way too much money.I'm currently migrating to OpenOffice.org 1.0. I've been using the Writer word processing program for several weeks now, and it works fine. I use it to write papers and other documents. I even used OpenOffice.org Writer to write up a summary of our reading for a class study group, converted it to Word, and sent it to about 20 people. No one wrote back to complain. When it comes to office productivity, the best, most affordable choice is OpenOffice.org 1.0. It has the same functionality as StarOffice and has all the core features of Microsoft Office, plus you can covert documents back and forth from Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. It's a fraction of the cost to boot! You can even buy it on CD from Amazon.com through zShops or get this: download it from the Internet if you have the time and understand how to work with zip files. Search for OpenOffice.org on the main Amazon.com site."
1,Why doesn't Microsoft give you a book anymore?,"How come you spend so much money on a Microsoft Office suite and not get a real big thick 'How to use it"" and ""reference book"" with the software?I hate to read anything longer than a few pages online. I like to read a book and be able to mark up the pages with my notes. Is it too much to ask for a big book with an expensive piece of software you buy? Online is great for searching for a quick answer, but I don't know ANYONE who loves to read books online.Of course, I guess they do this so you can buy their $$$ books seperate from the software.At least Star Office gives you a 460 page book and a 70 page setup guide."
3,Microsoft Office XP,"The product was exactly what it claimed to be; obviously an older version and used. However, after some initial rejection of the product key, I was able to install the software successfully."
1,Padding Bill Gates' pocket!!!,"This is just a hyped up, embellished version of their previous software. And to charge that price and not let me install it at work and home!!!! Guess that will stop me from taking my work home with me, won't it! They will let you install on a desktop and laptop under one license, but not two desktops!!! What a farce! I have to use the little money I make doing extra work at home to purchase another program!!!!!!! ANGRY - VERY!!!!"
3,Not that much more functional...,"Not a really huge upgrade over Office 2000. Does add some great annoyances like Smart Tags. Sure, there are some nice new features but I don't think it is worth this hefty price tag, even if you were buying the upgrade. Some of the applications seem to have taken a step backwards, as Outlook has lost the ability to send your schedule, tasks, and contacts to another user (I did this since I was sharing between two computers). Unless you are stuck back in the stone ages with Office 97, I wouldn't really spend the money on upgrading to this. If you are buying new, check prices on Office 2000, because it's not that much different."
3,An annoying hassler,"I have Office XP Professional 2002. The bad thing about it now is it keeps annoying me with a Windows Installer every time I executean Office application or anything with Internet Explorer that popsup trying to install FrontPage, and I have FrontPage on my computer. It's trying to configure it / thinks I don't have it and that's why I gave up on Internet Explorer and switched to Mozilla Firefox."
5,MicroSoft Office XP,I was very pleased with the program I received. It was everything I had hoped it would be even though it did not have the original case. Everything worked fine. I would definitely order from this vendor again.
2,Good,"That is very good software, but i would like in the dictionary include pronunciation of the words searched...The Outlook doesn't convince me, is so slow and make a mess on my other e-mail accounts. On the whole Out look is very good idea but it needs its improvements. I tried to send mails with pictures and the receivers never got it,they just received the terrible red ""X"", I just hope went i uninstalled from my computer I can re-install on other one, because it needs on line registration for continue installing..."
5,Works great.,I like this product because it works great with my XP SP2. Don't go to SP3 if you don't have to.
2,Word is worse....,"MS Word's biggest weakness has been style management. In XP, it became even weaker. Word 2000 allowed a user to modify a style after opening a series of dialog boxes. In Word XP, you must first open a side panel that takes almost one third of your screen. Then if you know where to click, you can eventually find the same series of dialog boxes that were in Word 2000.If you created a document in Word 2000, don't expect it to look the same in Word XP. In Microsoft's infinite wisdom, the fonts that are provided with XP are different than Word 2000. XP has some new fonts, but deleted some of the old fonts. It can become frustrating.Unfortunately, MS Office has become the defacto standard with no challengers in sight. So, stick with MS Office 2000. As a general rule, avoid MS products that have revisions as letters, such as ""ME"" or ""XP."" Stick to updates that are named after the numbered year (e.g. 98 or 2000) ;)"
2,Way overpriced,"MS Office has certainly become the sort of standard for office suite software, but, it is just too darn expensive! Almost [$$] for the pro edition? No wonder why Microsoft had to start the required key registrations (requires contacting MS with a specific key generated during install and then they provide you with another key to ""unlock"" their software) - barely any home user can afford it anymore. But we need it because our workplaces use Office. I don't like the way they are sticking it to us. I'm switching to Sun's StarOffice [less$$] which is supposed to be compatible with Word, Excel, and Powerpoint and just as good."
2,Good for very simple tasks,"Simple editing, spreadsheet tasks are easy in MS Office. Tasks at and above college levels are very hard to impossible to do."
1,not compatable with Windows 2000 Professional,"When I installed Windows office, it crashed my Windows 2000 Professional. Also, Sblive is not compatible with WIndows 2000. It seems to be like they are not compatible to each other. BE CAREFUL when you upgrade!!!!!"
3,Unclear details,"I received my CDs yeaterday. There was nothing wrong with them, except I thought it was to have a manual included with it. I am not sure if my memory was correct or if I am becoming dilusional.Vicki"
4,Out of Print title located!,Principles of Corporate Finance met all our expectations. The book is out of print and we were happy to be able to obtain a copy.
4,A great way to get introduced to corporate finance!,"The book covers the basics and it does this with elan. For people who already know the basics, this readable work generates enough interest in the topics to keep them glued. However, to go into the depths of any specific topic, one has to go elsewhere as is expected. I found their last chapter exceptionally well written and thought provoking. This chapter lists the most important areas in finance with short paras (""What we know"") and then goes on to list the areas in which more (research) work is required (""What we don't know"").(I have read about 30 % of their work and find it very interesting!)"
1,Waste of time!,"The whole book is one giant mistake. This starts with the unlogic structure, poor visualization, non-related exercises and ends with lecturers' material (Powerpoint presentation) that is loaded with mistakes.This book puzzles more than it helps.One huge catastroph that should be forbidden for any serious student of Corporate Finance. Scandal!"
5,Still the best corporate finance intro book,"The new edition of Brealey & Myers's classic introductory text on corporate finance is still the best. This is the book used by top universities and business schools for a first course on capital markets and corporate finance. The strengths of the book are: breadth (see the table of contents for the large number of topics covered), practicality (you learn the theory and also how to apply theory in practice), and clarity (very easy to follow). The student does not need prior knowledge to understand the materials.When I worked on Wall Street all my colleagues had a copy of Brealey and Myers. The new edition updates the text (I have not found any major changes). A must-have for those interested in the basics of corporate finance. Also a good refresher for seasoned professionals (but you already knew that!)."
4,npv,"I had to read a few chapters from this book for one of my finance classes. At first I was very skeptical of the text because of the authors' obsession with CAPM, beta, and modern portfolio theory. These concepts make no sense at all. They only serve to illustrate that even the most elegant mathematical models of the world have little practical value if the underlying assumptions are wrong. Very soon, however, my initial prejudice towards the book began to disappear. Eventually, I read the entire textbook, which wasn't required by my instructor. I still believe that CAPM and modern portfolio theory are all wrong but I was fascinated by authors' extensive discussion of NPV and Capital Structure. NPV, indeed, is the only proper way to value any business venture and no compromise can be made in this respect. Brealey & Myers got that one right.The book is well written and most of the examples and explanations are easy to comprehend..."
4,Reasonable...,"Though I have appreciated and enjoyed the product, the price seems a little steep for just one pair of these things. I imagine the cost of production is just pennies... With all due respect, I imagine a similar product could be made with the right kind of packing material cut to the same size."
3,Fits great just a little thin for the price,I am overweight and must have knee pads when I get down or up. These fit the knee pockets well. They are thinner than I would like. I would like them to be at least 50% thicker if not double. I have looked all over for these as stores seem to sell out before I could buy them. Amazon had them and I got mine and glad to pay the price this time.
1,bad,"Just for your info, the seller Do It Sports did not send me this bag but the other model which I would never even consider buying. It created just hassle for me because I needed to resend the item back and bag the Amazon and seller to bear the shipping costs."
5,product product,Have used for years and love them .great product would recommend this product for everyone that owns a car ...
4,It's an air filter.,It's an air filter. It works fine in my 2006 Jeep Commander. I like that the oil change shop down the street will clean it for me for free when I get my oil changed.
1,Grand Cherokee overland air filter,"I ordered this filter for my vehicle, confirmed the correct fit on the order,when I received the filter it would not fit. I had to pay for the mistake that K&N made by saying the filter would fit my 2002 Jeep Grand cherokee Overland. I bought this vehicle new, no changes has ever been made. It would be nice to have the measurements for these filters, especially since the mfg has nothing to lose by selling it to you then not refunding the complete sales price."
3,The very best of Brazilian's guitar music roots!,"Tio Carreiro and Pardinho are one of the most popular singers in the Brazilian's guitar music roots. They play the popular ""viola caipira"", a type of brazilian guitar. See also ""Almir Sater"" and ""Sergio Reis""."
3,Wrong Title,"I've been searching for a fun journal book. I didn't want a book that was too serious. I guess I was fooled by the title. If your looking for a fun loving book on journals that doesn't take itself so seriously take a look at ""How to Make a Journal of Your Life"" by D. Price"
5,Journaling for Joy,This is a lovely book. I journal all the time and this is a place for special memories. I would recommend this journaling book for anyone who likes to write memories.
4,Great '70's sounding rock!!,"great album, with 3 stand-out tracks!1- A simple Question3- eternity awaits4- tie you upgreat rock that draws from the classics from the 70's!!!"
2,Not worth it,"If you are trying to learn probability, don't use this book. The examples presented in each section are pretty simple and then you get to the problems at the end of the section and they're totally out of left field. You need a second reference just to do the problems in the book. I didn't care much for prob/stats before and this book does not improve my opinion."
2,A Book for a Freshmen Level College Course?,"We are currently two chapter into the book and I have found the text to be nearly useless. There are solid proofs of the basic computations and examples are given. Unfortunately the formulas are extremely abstract while at the same time using mathematical jargon someone who has not taken statistics before would have little to no experience with. Some of the examples are great at helping you out on the first part of problems, but on parts c,d,e,f and g there isn't a whole lot to go off of. But as always universities never choose books based on how well it teaches a student, but normally by the number of editions the publisher puts out and the price of the book. If possible I would have a solutions manual on hand for homework."
1,I had to get a second textbook for this class...,"I'm only on chapter 3, to be fair, but so far I've hated this book. I dumped $120 into it and the example problems are way too simple, and nothing like the actual exercises I'm being graded on. The sections and explanations are short, variables aren't explained well, a lot of assumptions are made. I just finished calculus 1/2/3 with the excellent Stewart book, to then go to this one is a real nightmare. Luckily for me, I've got another book on statistics and probability from a past class, and between the two of them, I can puzzle out much of it. NOT recommended."
1,This book is a no no,"I'm an engineering student using this book now and i find it is useless. The examples dont flow smoothly for people who have never seen this stuff before, and the reading is unbelievably dry and confusing."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"We used this book for my Math 250 class, which is still considered ""introductory statistics"". And because this book is for engineering majors, most of the problems have to do with mechanical things-my college doesn't even have an engineering major! If you miss a day of class, don't expect to be able to teach yourself from the book. The examples are horrible and the practice problems are even worse. I would not recommend this book to ANYONE. If this is the book your school uses, good luck!"
1,Not worth the money,"This book is nowhere near as rigorous as most college statistics classes will be, and serves little purpose. It has many problems (a plus), but the subjects are not treated as in-depth as they should be. This is fine, I suppose, for a basic understanding of probability and statistics, but for readers who want to go beyond that, this is not worth the money. Buy DeGroot instead, it's much better."
2,Ordered new condition US edition...,and i got a used condition (some damage to the binding of the book) that was an International Edition. Book still works for what i need but not what i ordered
4,Good Info On ID Making,"I liked what this book had to say about making id's. If you have a computer, this book will tell you everything you can do to make your own id. But, new id's are coming out, which will make it impossible to duplicate those on computers of today."
1,Misleading title. Beware.,"The book is sparse on substance. There's nothing in it that I already hadn't learned on the various internet sites that discuss this topic.The ""and other ID"" part of the title is very misleading as there are about 150 words dedicated to this. Basically the author says, ""You can make other ID, too, using these techniques."" (I paraphrase here).The best part of this book was the picture of the author's cat, which I thought was pretty cool."
1,you gotta be kidding,"Sure, make an outdated license.. get busted and goto jail. Try drinking at a place that doesn'task for ID. Duh?"
4,Excellent literature,"I thought A Break With Charity was one of Ann Rinaldi's best works. This novel was filled with much detail. It explained what happened during the Salem Witch Trials, and what it was like for the people who accused others. This book wasn't filled just with facts about the Salem Witch Trials, it told a story about a young, fictional character, whoose family was accused of being witches. In my personal Opinion this was a excellent piece of literature..."
3,Based on some truth from God and unfortunately some man's views,"This documentary started out right on track with bible truth. Unfortunately, when Bro. Branham turned a corner to start his teaching ministry (Just as Jesus Christ had done) the mass of peoples left him. The people seemed to only want the healings and discernments - not the truth of the word.Outside fringe religous leaders made it very hard for Bro Branham to hold meetings and get God's truth out. The DVD - God's General - Bro. William Marion Branham has many sound biblical ideas behind it until the teaching ministry, which then the author/director leaves the truth and starts believing mortal men who obviously had an agenda against Bro. Branham getting God's message to the people."
4,I Never Realized How Bad My Water Was!,"Everyone should watch this video,I knew that the quality of my drinking water was not the best that's why we bring in bottled water for drinking and cooking. However I never realized that bathing in all that chlorine could be irritating my psoriasis. Because of this video I'm taking immediate action to eliminate another hazard to my health....."
4,A Message More People Need to Hear,"Overall, this is a good presentation. I like the fact that it addresses the problem of contaminants in water (including chlorine), and the shortcomings of purification systems like reverse osmosis. Even though I've read a lot about water pollution, I still learned a few new things.The only criticisms I have are that 1) some of the narrator's lines are repeated, and 2) there are a number of still shots in the video instead of live action video. These are minor issues though -- the message is solid and more people need to be aware of the dangers lurking in their tap water."
5,The Filter I Have Isn't Enough,"I've had a shower filter for 4 years now, but after watching this DVD, I now realize that I need to take additional protective measures. You've heard the saying that ""knowledge is power."" Knowledge is also ""good health."" In today's day and age, you really do not know what's in a box or a can you buy at the store and you don't know what's in the water that comes out of the faucet in your home. You really do need to seek out and acquire the knowledge that is necessary to protect and enhance your health. You can begin today to procure that knowledge by watching the hidden danger in your water DVD."
5,best water resource I have ever found,"I was really surprised by the content and the production quality. I was not expecting much. This is a very well produced DVD and the content is terrific. If you want to be sure you and your family are drinking healthy water (the lifeblood of our bodies) you should check this out. It is technical enough so you understand the science, but presented in such a way it is easy to follow and comprehend.I have tested our tap water in our home and it is dangerous as can be. I highly recommend this resource. It should be must viewing for anyone that cares about their health or the health of their family. Great job."
4,"Truly ""Edwoodian."" So Bad it's good","Folks, leave your brains at the door. This is good old Edwoodian schlock about a bad boy who gets mixed up with the wrong crowd. Laugh out loud at the outragous stupidity and unintentioned humor of horrible dialougue, bad acting , and sheer senselessness. Who the heck would insist that a doctor under pressure of gunpoint operate on him? (That's just for starters). The surprise ending (which I won't reveal here) is pretty good. But the Blackface minstrel performance as an abomination not only for modern P.C. reasons (as an African-American myself, I've seen far worse in old movies), but it is not funny at all (the guy in Blackface whines and strains his voice in a gross effort to sound ""Black"" and the gags consist of very bad puns). In true Edwoodian style, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the story. But if you and your friends are filled with beers and pizza and want a good howl for over an hour, then this is for you."
1,Ed Wood Meets Film Noir,"Sandwiched between the infamous ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Bride of the Monster,"" director Ed Wood's ""Jail Bait"" (1954) combines fatalistic crime drama with his trademark ineptitude. Once in a while, Wood effectively captures the nighttime sleaze of Los Angeles and its environs. For the most part, however, the Master of Bad Cinema lives up to his moniker. There's plenty of Woodian nonacting and mind-numbing dialogue, with a ""twist"" ending that generates more laughter than shock. Bela Lugosi somehow managed to avoid this turkey, but veterans Lyle Talbot and Herbert Rawlinson were not so lucky. Always economical, Wood utilized the irritating flamenco-guitar score from ""Mesa of Lost Women"" (1953) - a no-budget monstrosity that surpasses ""Jail Bait"" in sheer awfulness."
3,flawed but enjoyable,"Although flawed with poor acting etc. I feel the story could have been a first rate crime drama in competent hands. It would have been more convincing had the killer and the brother resembled each other more. Talbot`s line, ""she`s an awfully pretty girl"" was repeated twice. Who was he trying to convince, the audience or the character in the scene with him? Pretty? Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One of the most blatant flaws was near the end when Talbot was able to change his suit and grow a mustashe as he ran out the door to chase the murderer. Still, I found the movie enjoyable for what it is."
5,A Fun Favorite!,"The set was given to us as a gift a few years ago and our kids have enjoyed it so much that we have worn out a couple of the pages! With favorite recipes like M&M cookies included in this book, be sure to keep it on hand for easy access. The mouse cookie cutter is cute but even cuter is the little story done in pictures throughout the book and it's recipes. Kids will revisit the mouse and the boy from the original ""If you give a mouse a cookie"" book, in another story about baking cookies. This will grow to be a favorite book, not just a recipe book...we ""read"" it for our bedtime story tons of times!"
4,90 Dodge 250 PU installation,"This hitch was a joy to install. It clearsthe tire carrier hook, fits perfect, and looksgood. I highly recommend it."
2,NOT a self-setting clock,"This is not a self-setting clock, unless they mean that you have to set the clock yourSELF. Thermometer features work fine, though."
4,LINKIN PARK like rocks.....,"This single is one of my better ones. It has the radio released, Meteora track ""Numb"". Even though I have seen better videos from LP. But it still is very good. Oh yeah and you can't forget about LP's live explosive perfomance in track 2, ""From The Inside"". And if you enjoyed it you'll enjoy even more the other ""Numb"" single featuring the even better , creative ""Faint"" video. ""LINKIN PARK like rocks."""
5,Great weight B-ball,"This product is very good for my 11 year son. I coach 11U county basketball and purchase two balls for training drills. This heavyweight training basketball is great for youth kids, really enforce kids to make layups and shooting jumper 10' end."
4,Price is Right,Bought 2 to work on strength and ball handling skills. Exactly what I was anticipating. Well worth the small investment.
5,quality product,I've purchased 6 of these now for my youth teams. All have been good quality and have met my expectations.
2,Okay but not great,Purchased this product about 6 months ago and only issue with product is that I have to continue to pump the ball up for each practice. It doesn't hold air very well at all.
2,It's ok,"This move is just ok.My husband is a Police Officer so I was hoping to find a dvd with lots of police cars for my 2 year old. This movie is definitely informative, but it is SO outdated neither my husband nor I could stand to watch it!I'm sure it would be great for older kids, but still I can't get past how outdated it is.I have bought other ""All About"" DVDs (trains, airplanes, trucks.) I was looking for a section of each dvd with non-stop police cars/trains/trucks/airplanes moving around as a constant stimulus for my toddler. These dvds have a lot of talking--not nearly enough action to keep my toddler or me watching."
2,Disappointing first effort,"This is the first Arthur C. Clarke book I've read, and I was disappointed. Clarke writes traditional ""hard"" science fiction and, sadly, the science aspects of his work outweighed the narrative and emotional aspects. I just did not find these stories very imaginative (""Second Dawn"" would have been very good except for the melodramatic warning against atomic bombs at the end).Even when viewed in historical perspective, this collection of stories does not compare with Clarke's contemporaries, such as Asimov or Niven. The only real gem was ""The Sentinel"", which served as the inspriration for the movie (and novel) 2001: A Space Odyssey."
5,Wicked awesome clock,"This clock has the fasted atomic set time of any clock I have ever owned (normal set times are about 4-8 minutes, and this was under 2). Also, temperature and humidity are accurate and quick setting. The external sensor is pretty nice in its own right if you want a portable temp/humidity gauge. All-in-all a great buy.Also, what wasn't mentioned is that the clock unit has its own temperature and humidity gauge built in to the main unit."
3,Please note: Atomic Clock wont work on The East Coast...,"You have to be within 932 miles of Boulder, CO for the atomic clock feature to work. For instance, Richmond,VA is over 1700 miles from there.The stores here had fantastic clearance sales on this item. You found out why when you read the instructions, calculated the distance to boulder, CO, or contacted customer service.The .pdf file of the manual is available on the Oregon Scientific site.Their ""Weather in Motion"" model (Amazon calls it a ""Near Far Weather Station"") says in it's literature that it can receive from 2000 miles away. This would be a better choice if you live on the East Coast."
2,Taped In Extended Play Mode,"Instead of taping in standard play, Republic Pictures Home Video has taped this VHS in lower quality extended play mode. Black & White approx. 54 minutes. Exactly as pictured."
5,"Great Condition, timely receipt",I received my book in better condition that listed in and also received it in a timely manner. Very happy with this transaction.
4,Mother's Little Helper,"Bought this for me Mum to go with her birthday laptop. Her emails and photo attachments seem to be getting thru OK, so I guess the books works."
4,Excelent Office Suite Building on The Microsoft Tradition,"Office XP is a great upgrade to Office 2000, I have a preview of it now. I am not impressed with the speech recognition but I like typing better anyway. Other speech recognition pacakages are better. Overall it is excelent and worth the upgrade."
2,something missing,"Did anyone notice that Office 2000 Professional used to include FrontPage, Publisher and PhotoDraw but the Office XP Professional Upgrade only includes the basic applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Access)? I have a problem with that. I like MS products in general, but I expect their product lines to be consistent. The Prefessional Upgrade should upgrade all the applications. If the other applications were discontinued, that would be one thing, but the ""Special Edition"" includes the full suite. Is there a ""Special Edition"" upgrade to fully upgrade the original Professional Suite?"
4,"The need for a new office, not a new look.","This upgrade is particulary useless if you have an Office 2000 product. The design has been updated and 'smoothed' over. The only draw-back to this product is the fact that Word still auto-formats like usual, without the writers consent. If you are in the market for an upgrade over a pre-2000 office product this is for you. Would a 2000 Office owner get his/her's money worth in buying this, no."
3,Where is PhotoDraw??,"Having invested in Office 2000 Premium with PhotoDraw and numerous Microsoft and other reference materials, I find little reason to justify a purchase of Office XP without PhotoDraw and to start the repurchase of reference materials again."
2,Bend Ovah!,.... This has to be the most unnecessary software upgrade to date from Microsoft. There are virtually no significant enhancements over Office 2000. Those bells and whistles that are included in this product seem to do more to diminish performance than add functional value. And forget about trying to upgrade from any Office version older than Office 97 - they are not considered qualifying products and the upgrade WILL NOT INSTALL! Even Amazon's very competitive prices of [price] for the upgrade and [price] for the full version border on obscene. .... My recommendation is if you can live without it do so!
1,"Same stuff, with a new look","I tested the beta version of Office XP (Last candidate release) and the interface is cool but the functionality is almost the same. Only some XML stuff and many Windows crashes..If you have previous Office versions, don't waste your money.."
2,Don't Want or Need OFFICE XP,"After reading reviews I will keep my Office 2000. I really loved Wordperfect but due to big brother I have been forced to use MS Office. How rude to have to buy several copies, one fo r each computer, I have like 3 computers, I dont have that much money. I will be glad when someone invents a affordable and accepted wordprocessor speadsheet...."
2,A product to think about before you buy,"I bought this product expecting tons of enhancements from the 2000 office suite, there were little except for the special xp emblem. Furthermore, under the guise of a product activation(which must be activated in order to use the full version, otherwise you get the full version for a little bit before it reverts back to a demo), Microsoft limits the amount of computers you can install it on. I was only able to install it on two computers before it would not allow me to activate the product any longer, stating the product was already activated on another machine and to contact customer service. Overall, I would have to say that this product is grossly overpriced, and anyone looking for an office suite that is comparable, but much cheaper should check into Sun's Star Office(It works with Microsoft documents so it's worth it)."
3,Industry standard but over featured and too buggy,"Chocked full of features. More features than anybody will ever need, such as the dreadful team-cooperation feature set (probably copied from IBMs horribly buggy Lotus SmartSuite, which crashed all the time). Office too is still buggy after all these years. Ironically, this version seems more buggy than the previous version, Office 97, which was pretty stable in the end. Office is still not particularly user friendly either -- the excess of fluff-features complicates navigation. The horrible paper-clip ""office assistant"" is still around, despite what the press say. So, disappointing -- but the competition is much worse so you might as well succumb and buy it."
2,This is Not what you think!!,"Be careful when ordering this release. If you have the original release, then that is really all you need. I was under the impression that the 8 bonus tracks were part of this concert?? If they are, the crowd noise has been edited away so it takes away the flavor of the ""concert"" sound and causes one to question their legitimacy. Those 8 bonus tracks also lack the energy of the show at hand? The last track on disc 2 is an obnoxious and goofy, different version of Johnny Q which I have heard somewhere else before and so is not part of the show. I will have to investigate on which of my 8's albums that track comes from. If your curious, do not pay full price for this one. Thank goodness I got mine used!"
5,Great book,Love this book. This is the 6th copy I have purchased. I find it helpful to give to friends who have lost a loved one. Should be of the LDS persuasion.
1,Waste of Money,"This is one of the worst things I have ever purchased. It did NOTHING for my hair - no brightness, no color change, no nothing. My hair was dull and lifeless and I had to wash it again to get rid of the residue. I would NOT recommend this to anybody."
4,Good product,It gives me the color I want since I am not using temporary coloring I would like to receive the item ordered
4,101 Dalmatians,Well i think that this book was GREAT it takes me back to 4th grade were this would have been my favorite book becaues it as exitment and love.It just was a wounderful story and i see why they make more of theses not alone dose it show right from wronge but it tell you about how the family love the doge weather there where 13 dogs or 101 dogs it was great!
3,Motive from the past?,"When the body of former secret service agent, Major Eric Thoseby, is found in a rather seedy hotel in London, the blame immediately falls on his ex lover, French wartime resistance member, Victoria Lamartine, who is discovered standing over the body. In the ensuiung trial, the prosecution plays up the supposition that Thoseby was the father of Victoria,s child, who is now deceased. Victoria vehemently denies this, claiming that the child's father was actually a British agent, Lieutenant Julian Wells, a very young and inexperienced agent who was sent to France in 1943, captured by the Gestapo and listed as missing ever since. During Victoria's trial, the prosecution keeps hinting at Gestapo involvement but, despite the innuendo, the solution is amazingly simple with little mystery at all, so, despite the adulations of the critics on the back of the book, I didn't find this to be a terribly fascinating read."
5,great,"love this, i have a few in my home. i used one for my bathroom and its perfect to hand stuff on"
2,"Cheap, ineffective hardware",The hardware to hang the rack was so terrible that I had to remove it and fashion my own in order to secure the rack to the wall. If I had known how bad the hardware was I would never have bought it. A big drawback to buying online.
4,Works for me!,"Nothing fancy, just an expandable rack, exactly like the description. I am using it to hang my 8-month-old's hoodie collection. The one thing I would like to have added, if it were my way, is pre-drilled holes, so this can be attached to the wall without digging out my drill bits."
1,poor quality,"This rack is barely usable to hang mugs on. The pegs are wobbly and loose and the whole frame is flimsy. As I tried to hang it, the hanging loop bent and fell off. I would not trust any mugs to this rack! I also tried to hammer small brads into the end of the pegs to prevent the mugs from falling off (as I have done with other mug racks) and the pegs splintered and broke. Unless you want broken mugs, do not buy this rack!"
5,Great Product,This is a beefy cup holder. I am really impressed by it's sturdiness. Really fast shipping.
4,"Overall, Good Quality",Overall this unit is as advertised. I would have liked hanging tabs that were a bit more robust but its not a deal breaker. The pegs are fairly large so be sure the cup handle is large too.
4,Good for small spaces,"I live in a tiny house with limited counter and cabinet space, so a mug holder saves a lot of space for me.IT works pretty nice and does a good job at holding mugs. At first I was concerned that it would be flimsy, but once I put it on the wall it felt much sturdier. I am still debating if I should put a couple of nails right through it and literally nail it to my wall, just in case. But I don't think it is necessary."
5,"either way, it works....","i purchased this to allow the people in my office a place to hang mugs....given as a gift for the holiday! we mounted it vertically and its great. not only do we save on using styrofoam cups, but its attractive, efficient and allows more cabinet space in the small office kitchen. win, win!"
3,flimsy but manageable,The two loops on the back to hook onto something were small. Not sure if I would load this up full of coffee mugs on those alone. I ended up drilling through one of the slats and driving a screw into a wall anchor in addition to the two hooks. Looks to hold up fine now and have loaded it full of mugs. The screws at joints were loose and i had to tighten them. I also had to replace one screw with a larger one since the peg was falling off.
4,There is a light at the end of the tunnel.,I really enjoyed this book. It made me realize that everything I have been going through for the past 8 years is not unique to my situation. It comforted me to know that I was not alone. That other stepmothers had gone through the same things & felt the same way I have. It was a relief to know the emotional turmoil I have gone through is normal and that there is hope in sight. I can now look at the future with hope instead of despair.
3,Pretty,Border is very pretty and exactly what we wanted but the back does not peel off as easy which made the border rip.
4,Great adventure in the shadows of Neraka,"The DL series was a huge leap forward for TSR - these modules featured a new emphasis on drama and storytelling that made the gaming MUCH more fun and involved for the PCs and the DM. Of course, at heart, being TSR modules from the 80s, they're still dungeon crawls! In this chapter, the heroes (levels 10-13) must delve into the City of Neraka, and end the evil that plagues Krynn, by facing the Queen of Darkness herself..."
4,solid,this cd was a great intro to shortbus. they remind me a lot of SI SENORITA which most people don't know about but you can find them on my space. its a mix of ska and reggae blended with rock. e wilson kills it and the sublime name lives on with shortbus.
5,Highly Recommended a resource not to be missed.,Very thorough and readible as well. A resource that can't be missed when going to this legendary birding spot.
5,Great tasting and nutritious,"This is a wonderful snack bar. I find it filling and satifying. It doesn't hurt to get all those vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber, either."
3,Whipcord,This movie has a special English style . The ruial country side of England and a Family gone mad.Discipline Taken in their own hands of those they find guilty.Not enough female nudity or punishment to make the movieintersesting. It is disppointing to say the least.
1,Fast forward review,"OK, most sex sleaze fans already have the 30 seconds or so from this that are worthwhile, so I'll cut right to it; an entering prison strip scene, a naked whipped back and bottom lying on bed while hag prison guard almost runs her hands over it, and a naked whipped back while trying to escape scene. All with the same cute blonde. That's it.What you don't get is anything the title promises. There's one whipping scene, but it shows nothing, nada, except for a mom and perverted son getting mentally excited outside in the hall listening to the sound effects. I'll ignore the plot, it's basically just a women's prison movie without enough women and no shower scenes. Two stars for the good 30 seconds, less one star for the total tease of the title."
1,Buy popcorn,Maybe I didn't suffer through the same movie the others did? Is that possible? This movie doesn't even deserve a shooting star. It's poorly directed (the beginning rain scene is louder than the actors. And they distant. Guess a boom mic wasn't in the budget) This movie doesn't deserve any more of my time. Going for popcorn. They made me put a star in it.
3,Punished for their Transgressions,"This film seems to have reached cult status in some circles. A Young woman is lured to a mysterious rundown estate and undergoes an ordeal of physical and mental suffering for her worldly ways. Hidden from the outside world, females are stripped naked and punished under the lash for their transgressions. That is only the beginning of their nightmare existence of imprisonment where the viewer witnesses punishments doled out by a mock jury of eccentric characters. This film is an interesting entry into the mystery-horror genre but its true intentions remain elusive."
1,Fast forward review,"First, any additional sleaze scenes on the DVD? Nope.So, what we got here is one scene with a previously-whipped back of a pretty blonde being admired by the sadistic guard, and then a full back nude scene of the blonde as she tries to escape. Two brief bottom shots, that's it. They're pretty good though, very realistic whip damage, one of the best ever.There's some other minor nudity (the undressing scene at the start of course), and I might give it one more star if it wasn't for the absolutely gutless cop out of showing zero actual whipping scenes in a movie titled like this. Shameful.I suppose it has to be in the collection for the cell scene mentioned above."
2,Hung Jury,There is the sound of stinging leather being applied to quivering flesh. This is followed by the terrifying resonance of a female victim. This whole film is nothing but a collection of ridiculous would be horrifying sounds. There is really nothing visual to this film that would even make it slightly interesting. Our female victims get put on mock trial with unimaginative results. That's about it! The best thing about this DVD is its titillating and enticing cover.
3,Proverbial Van Down by the River,"Despite the gracious full frontal male nudity which is shocking now days, this film is boring! Even though D'Allesandro (the random hung naked guy of many Morissey / Warhol films) is every inch (literally) gorgeous (despite crawling around looking like a homeless man), nothing prevents the crawling creeping restless boredom of this film. (If that was the intent of this film, well then-well done.) If nothing else it serves as a prompting for a liberal's worst nightmare awakening: that hippies and alt. culture are hated for some good reasons. It serves well too as a proverbial ""van down by the river"": it will deeply motivate you to do something with your life and never end up like this. Nancy Reagan should've thought of this film when she was telling kids to just say no."
2,"TRASH,TRASH,TRASH!!","The movie is really trash. The movie starts out showing Joe Dallesandro's [rear] and Geri Miller go-go dancing naked. Later on in the movie we meet Holly Woodlawn a trash collector who is a transvestite and a former prostitute. More graphic nudity and sex come up when Jane Forth and her husband come in the story. An all right beginning,middle, and end but the story is terrible."
3,Good Information but Wanted More,"I enjoyed the information that was in this book. I was hoping for more information that would help me access my own deeper intelligence and was a little disappointed there. However, there were some great points to learn, and I've certainly been listening more carefully to the hidden communications of my family and friends. I recommend it for those who are curious about the ""more"" that is going on within themselves and others."
5,Christian wisdom,"For over 20 years I have worked with the Communicative Approach which is the basis of the Deeper Intelligence. Not once, has the material contradicted the Bible. In some cases I have treated it has helped remove obstacles that blocked people from accepting Christ as their saviour. It has also helped some people of faith have a more loving relationship with God. Well worth the time to learn about the language that the Deeper Intelligence uses to talk to us.Harold S. Schaus, Jr., M.S., DAPATwo time president of the International Society for Communicative Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy"
1,Disappointed!!,You are showing it with a handle and there is none. It is made good but it is not like in the picture.
5,just what i asked for,i need replacement filters for my humidifier. i received them quickly and they work great. And because my humidifier keeps running no flu or cold yet!
5,Excellent - Great,One of the better books that I have read on this subject. It's a must for anybody wanting to know anything about what the Jews have and are going through today. I'm glad that I have it in my library.Jim
3,Pogroms,"This is a 192-page, small size (4.5""x7"") paperback containing about 400 instances since the death of Jesus whereby some Christian mob has molested, maimed, tortured, killed and looted the property of Jews (for being collectively condemned as `Christ killers') - primarily in Europe. Each incident is described in a brief paragraph: the number assaulted, which city, when and what caused to pogrom to occur. Besides noting locations, anti-Semitic utterances or publications by specific authors are listed (St. Augustine, various popes, Martin Luther, etc.) Specific anti-Jew sentences in the New Testament are listed, too. After reading this, one realizes that the 1930s German Nazi movement was not an aberration. Few WWII massacres are noted, simply too many for this small booklet. Not in chronological order. Just enough info here to entice a reader to begin searching for more scholarly books. While each instance is not specifically referenced, a 3-page bibliography is included."

1,Totally UNoriginal,"I think this book is very translucent. There really seems to be no depth or originality. It seems as though the author needs to focus more on herself to discover herself. Let the real personality shine through these works. It seems as though the words at times may ""sound"" pretty but really seem to be quite superficial."
4,Roux Fanci Full Mousse #56 Bashful Blonde 6 oz,"In summer when the sun bleaches out your gold-blond color this is a perfect product to put some ""ash"" in your hair. You'll enjoy that you're not yellow any longer. Use this since at least 20 years. (It doesn't cover grey hair fyi.)"
4,Good product,"This product gives your hair a nice color tone. It's not a huge difference, but enough to make the purchase worthwhile. Also, it's works well as a styling mousse."
1,Your rabbit is not a hamster,"Any rabbit food with seeds should be avoided at all costs. Rabbits have very specialized gi tracts that have more similarities to a horse than say a hamster or gerbil. The most important element of a rabbit's diet is unlimited hay, preferablly timothy for older bunnies. This is also vital to a bunny's health since, unlike cats, they are unable to cough up any furballs that may form from hair swallowed during grooming. The hay helps to push the hair and other obstructions along the gi tract. Pellets shouldn't be the bun's only source of hay and should never have seeds or corn."
2,Waste!!!!!!,"I bought this for my 1 yr 3 m Mini Rex, Thumper, and my 1 yr 3 m Netherland Dwarf, Princess. It is a waste of money. My rabbits only ate the treats, and they left the pellets alone. This is not technically the manufactionurs' fault, but still. Stick with plain pellets. It's cheaper and healthier."
5,It is a good rabbit food!!,"I bought several brands of rabbit food at stores in my town but all of them caused my rabbit to lose his fur due to the soy, but not this one! He really seems to enjoy all the different goodies in this food. Thank you amazon for stocking this food!!"
4,Aint Nothin' But The Blues,"This debut recording by the Allman Brothers is pure blues and little else. However, it features some top notch guitar playing by Duane Allman and Dickey Betts not to mention Greg Allman passionate vocals.The best song on this collection is clearly the last track, Whipping Post. What a searing bass line. Then followed by dueling guitars and bluesy vocals telling a tale of sorrow and woe. A true classic tune.Blackhearted Woman and It Aint My Cross To Bear are probably the best of the rest. The other tunes are OK but a bit limited in style. Dreams is a slight diversion but the song just is a bit too long even with the pretty solo work by Duane.The Allman Brothers would do better on follow up work particularly on Idlewide South and Brothers And Sisters. None the less, any fan of the band would still appreciate this recording."
3,Saber tocar y hacer buen blues no siempre es lo mismo,"Los Allman Bothers son una de las formaciones más sólidas de blues rock americano de fines de los 60's, y aunque eso no es poco su nivel no está a la altura de sus competidores ingleses. No hay nada que decir respecto a su capacidad para asimilar y ejecutar el blues, contando con dos competentes guitarristas y una buena sección de apoyo, pero su ortodoxa aproximación a este estilo los hace ser una buena banda pero no más que eso.Cuando en esa época ya han pasado muchas cosas dentro del rock americano se podría esperar algo un poco más aventurado por parte de los Allman, justamente algo como Dreams o Whipping Post, por mucho los temas más interesantes y donde se abren a nuevas cosas, el primero 7 minutos de electrizante blues sicodélico y el segundo un denso blues con un toque propio. Los 5 temas restantes son correctos pero fácilmente olvidables, dejando la impresión que sería mejor recurrir a otros discos para quedar conforme."
5,dreams rocks yet its soft in the same way,this album is truly awsome i love dreams although all of it is very good. i do recomend beginings because you get both the first two albums instead of having to buy both of them
3,Questionable release,"Stick with 'The Fillmore Concerts'. This from the vaults release is interesting but hardly a must-have. It's raw, gritty and sloppy in places and Gregg's vocals are way too loud. But Duane is on it and that's always reason to listen. The venue is odd and the mix even odder as explained in the liner notes. 7.5 IPS STEREO MASTER, yikes! One half soundboard the other half ambience mike, sheesh. It sounds exactly what is was: the band recorded in a gymnasium. Of course the disc has been 'normalised' and the high end is sorely lacking and the vocals may blow you out of the room they are so loud. The digital restoration must have been a nightmare. The songs are good choices but sound like practice runs for the Fillmore shows, some guitar solos sound distant thanks to the mix. I suppose the hard-core fan will want this but for serious fans, they may want to pass. 7 tracks/60.26."
4,"Want to hear Duane, get this cd","1st, The Allman Brothers at Fillmore East release is probably the greatest rock live release ever so it is not to be compared against. That cd is extraordinary. It was great back in 1971 and is still great today. The sound quality of American University is good. But, the sound quality should not detract from what is going on with the music. We are able to listen to the Allman Brothers with Duane Allman.We are lucky to have a release like this with Duane Allman. I hope we get more from the Bros.I am listening to the cd for the 3rd time and let me tell you, it is the Allman Brothers. Don't Keep Me Wondering. Trouble no More. It is all there. Greg might be a little loud but he sounds great. Duane is screamin along with Dickey. The drums are banging and the blues a playin. Get this cd if you like the Allman Brothers."
5,anonymous,"if you like bluesy rock and roll, this is an awesome album by a truly unique band. the musicianship alone is enough reason to get ""the allman brothers band"" cd. buy it! buy it! BUY IT!"
2,returned,"Very informative and nice for a collector, but extremely hard to read.Copies of the reports and newspapers, and letters from ripper in original style and prose."
3,There are better books out there.,"This was fairly interesting and well written, but for a good, thorough biography of Princess Vicky, ""An Uncommon Woman"" is a far better choice. On the other hand, if you are looking for a fairly brief overview of her life and loves, this book will spare you the extreme detail found in ""Uncommon Woman."""
4,An unusually happy marriage,"Throughout history, it was rare for a royal marriage to be a loving one, this is the story of Vicky and Fritz, a prince and princess so in love, but perhaps with and ending that wasn't as happy as it began.The story goes into immense detail about a time and place I didn't know as much about beforehand. I love it when a book like this, even a short one, can work as a little mini classroom in which I immerge more enlightened. I found the author immerses you into the setting and brings his subjects to life. Vicky and Fritz, though so devoted to one another, unfortunately, did not have the fairy-tail ending that should have begun on the day of their wedding. You'll have to read the book for all the details on what could have been. Perhaps WWI may not have happened, if one man had been a little more cordial with his parents. Great biography!"
2,cute,This is a nice looking gadget. Very poor picture quality. Can not get the software to work for music recording. Having problems with the camera shutting down . Thought it was a defective battery so bought another and the same problem. Camera shuts down before i can even get to menue. All i can say is that is is cute. I bought another tiny camera for my purse that takes video and stills and that camera [didn't] cost [that much] and i get excellent 8 by 10 prints.
3,Improving the SD Jukebox,"I got this camera and I cannot get the JukeBox to work!The sftwr is awful, how do you convert your WMA music files to MP3 on that software, do you need the CD to send it to the SDcard?Why dont they allow you to use other software?Come on Panasonic... you can do better..."
2,Don't expect too much,"1.) 2X zoom doesn't work while capturing video. 2.) At ""Super Fine"" setting you get only 19 minutes on a 128MB SD card 3.) Captured video pauses quite often 4.) It takes video & pix SIDEWAYS! You need software like Micro$oft MovieMaker 2 to rotate the video to the correct orientation 5.) Uses DRM so you can't just copy your mp3 to the device except through the included software, which is AWFUL 5.) You can't delete music files from the device; you must use the software 6.) No graphic equalizer"
4,love it,"this bleach is pure, no additives, which is good. I used to use to wash clothes with it but found over time, it tears up/wears down the clothes. I use 7th generation oxy bleach now and its much gentler on the clothes."
1,Worst customer service ever.,i sent my camera to repair for years. never got information from the casio service. i have no got my camera back so far. You need to call them thousand times and always say they will call back. NEVER!!!
2,No help from manufacturer!,"I spent over $50.00 for a 512MB SD card for this camera, and it doesn't work! Tried several SD cards, and the camera will not work with them. It WILL work with an MMC card, however. Have emailed Casio 4 times and have not received a reply. I'm sending the camera back to them, and I'll go find a camera that actually works like they say it's supposed to!"
1,Jake Burns fails to produce a good album...again,"Here is a prime example of a band who should've just called it quits after their first few albums. Well, actually, they did, but then of course, Mr. Burns has to go a get a few people who were never in the band and, instead of calling it something in the vein of The Jake Burns Experience, he slaps his old band's moniker on it. Classic cash in attempt. Perhaps over these past ten years of touring like mad (since he's apparently broke or something) ""SLF"" have gotten more serious about their music, they just don't sound like it, that's all. Skip this album and pick up Inflammable Material or Nobodys Heroes instead and don't get ripped off like I did. If you want good, current pop punk, get the Presidents of the United States of America's new album, which, unlike this chum, is still fresh and interesting."
5,pleasant plucking,"As a new harper, I wanted to listen to varying techniques, and that is exactly what I got with Highland Heart. I listen to it often, for technique, for relaxation, for pleasure. The celtic cover is great too!!"
5,When you don't know how to pray for your husband...,"Stormie comes through! When I first read her book, The Power of a Praying Wife, I was immediately convinced of the ideas she presented, but didn't know exactly how to go about doing it. With the cards, I can have a starting place to pray for my husband on various different topics and it's amazing the way that those cards open up the spirit to receiving other insights to pray for! I definitly recommend these cards to anyone trying to follow the principles of Power of A Praying Wife."

1,Self-extinguishing!,"It looks nice and is dishwasher safe, but this thing is worthless! The candle would only stay lit for about 2 minutes before dying out. The base is too short, so there is not enough room between the candle flame and the bottom of the teapot. I tried an assortment of teapots and several different types of tealight candles with the same results everytime. I think the flame must die from lack of oxygen. I returned mine and received a refund."
4,Good Deal,These were a great choice considering I really don't give much thought to these things. My husband was shocked at the quality of sound coming out of something I spent so little on. These were a really great deal.
4,great sound for the money,"Good sound system, lots of bass. Better than many systems that cost twice as much."
3,It works well,"Only problem I have with this is the fact that the little trim plate around the radio is loose. It doesn't snap into the clips inside the mounting as it should, and thus, it keeps falling out. This is only a problem because the face of my stereo slides itself outward in order to be removed every time the car is turned off. After three or four times of this, the trim pops off in the midst of driving down the road, or while the stereo face is attempting to slide outward."
3,They're adequate,"They don't screw onto the lens smoothly at all, I always worry that I'm damaging the threads. In general they're fine, especially for the cheap price."

3,Honest Review,"Here's my honest, non-brown nosing the Mars Volta opinion. This album is so and so. Nothing on here screams out 'amazing' and this would not appeal to you just because you love At the Drive-In and/or the Mars Volta. I understand loyalty and all because I love the two above mentioned bands but this solo debut just doesn't live up to it.Omar is responsible for the sound of any band he's been in, writing all of the music in his unique style. I think Omar should have actually held this soundtrack off until his movie came out.Overproduced, alot of the usual Mars Volta-synth and mellow, floaty intros and break downs, reverse guitar and hispanic music influence.. with a big dose of Pink Floyd.... borrow this album. Don't kill your 18$ on it unless you are sure you will want to listen to this over and over. My copy has been made use of maybe 6 times since I got it.. as opposed to ""De-Loused"" which gets listened to once a week."
4,OMAR,"Omar is a musical genious. Soundtrack 1 sounds good, can't wait for #2 perhaps to blow me away, i hope. IMO omar is a very very very talented muscian. i like the way he puts the snipets of spanish voices and AMAZING GUITAR Playing and sound scratch efects, mixed all up together is kinda cool."
3,Meh,"I am a huge Volta fan, and there are a few snippets of classic Omar in this, but a lot of it is simply noise. However, the snippets that are coherent are great. That's really about it."
