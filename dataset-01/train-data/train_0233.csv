1,Viewers should take care ...,"Hankey's film fails to have any credibility as a documentary. His efforts are to influence the viewer with emotional rhetoric and symbols (i.e. glorifying, almost deifying, Kennedy, labeling the Bushes and associates as Nazis, including G. W. Bush, who has nothing to do with the subject, because G.H.W. Bush's grandfather was and alleged Nazi sympathizer, labeling people devils, extensive use of super imposed swastikas and skull and cross bones, etc), and logic that is repeatedly based on chains of supposition. This use of emotional rhetoric, symbols, and supposition are propaganda tactics, not tools of analysis and reason. The un-careful, or unaware viewer could easily be swept up in Hankey's propaganda film.People interested in this CIA-Kennedy assassination theory should also investigate the Mary Pinchot Meyer and the Mary Pinchot Meyer-JFK link. There is far more provocative evidence there than anything Hankey asserts."
1,High School Film Project Gone Wrong.,This is what happens when wacko ultra left winger buy cameras and editing equipment for their naive teenage sons.Glad we live in a country where so many weirdos are able to live so freely.
1,Is this part of the conspiracy?,"Of all the videos, books and other pieces of information that I have had the chance to view, this has by far been the strangest. I have purchased this video from two different outlets on Amazon. Both times, the outer case has been the Dark Legacy, the D.V.D itself had the ""Dark Legacy"" design on it but the video itself was ""The Other Side of A.I.D.S"". Could this be someone connected to H.W trying to stop the word from getting out? I just find it strange that this would happen on a video with this content."
4,sisterhood vs. family,Easy and interesting book to read as I read in an evening setting as my interest had questions I wanted answered. Since I was not a part of a sorority setting I wanted to know what was so special about these groups but that was not really the storyline as much as it was about a family bonding together before they seek to go out and help the world that may seem to be less fortunate.
4,Secrets really kill the soul,This book was alright with me. Usually I have a problem with the characters when it comes to this author but not with this book. This book was an example of how secrets can really kill the soul. How secrets can affect three or more generations of a family. The only big problem I had was that the author act like you can't find good friends outside of a sorority. Not everyone who joins a sorority is about sisterhood and volunteering. This author loves happy ending and if that her writing style I guess I will have to deal with it if I am going to keep reading her books.
3,The Delta Sisters,"I thought I had it figured out, but Perrin got me with the ending. Pretty good read about not-so-perfect mother-daughter relationships. Sylvia, the snobby meddling mother, Olivia the love-struck daughter turned alcoholic, and Rachelle, the daughter/granddaughter who wants her independence but craves her mother's love. What is the secret that Sylvia Grayson has hidden all of these years and how will the revelation affect those she loves? Some of the story is rather easy to figure out with the clues Perrin throws in, but I definitely didn't see the ending coming. Perrin has created a story that, while not a page turner, is worth a read. 3 stars."
4,Suspenseful,"Well written, the novel is set in New Orleans and even dabbles in voodoo. This multi-generational novel allows us to see the effects of generational curses and also the effect on mother daughter relationships."
5,long time lichtenberg fan.,I've long loved Jacqueline Lichtenberg's Sime Gen series. Ithink her novels are well thought out and appeal on many levels. What I want to know is When can we get the rest of the Luren series on kindle?
1,Put me out of my misery.....,"You know how some books create characters and a world you love so much, you try to read slower because you don't want the book to end? This is not one of those books. I'm a fairly fast reader so I always finish any book I start. I have never regretted this policy more than now. I am three quarters of the way through this book and the end can't some soon enough for me. The best part of the book was the lengthy ""Acknowledgement"". The author seems to be a nice person and I feel bad panning her book but if I can save anyone the misery I'm in, I have to do it. If you want vampire/romance, read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton."
1,BORING,"Maybe the non-purists will enjoy this CD, but I found it more boring than I could tolerate. Could barely get through listening to the whole thing. I'm a jazz fan and a Miles fan, but this CD is enough to put one to sleep."
1,"Miles is great, but he wouldn't have wanted this.","God. The (dead) angriest genius in jazz is being posthumously sold to yuppies for Valentine's Day as some sort of Casanova of the trumpet, complete with slick nineties packaging. I don't care if the music on here is great, and I'm sure it is, since Miles was totally brilliant-- it doesn't matter, since this music is being marketed toward people who are going to get romantic to it rather than actually listen. So not only is it a cash-in compilation, but it's one that Miles would be embarrased by. God bless Miles; curse his record company for selling him out like this when he can't do anything about it. Get a real Miles Davis album instead."
1,Ben Mann 2,"I fully agree with Ben Mann. Even to see a name like ""LOVE SONGS"" associated with Miles Davis makes me sick. This name humiliates the contents of his music."
4,"This CD is great for ""lounging""",Listening to the wafting sounds of Miles Davis is sure to please any Fan or soon to be Fan.
4,good,"I am not a fan of compilation cds, but this set from Miles' is a nice one, showcasing his softer, more melodic side of this playing. While he certainly revolutionized jazz many times, it's easy to forget that Miles continued to play standards at live shows (granted, in an increasingly radical way as time went on) well into the late 60's, and again towards the end of his life, he would throw ""Stella By Starlight"" into his live sets.This is a very nice collection of Miles' love songs, and for the casual fan may very well be worth looking into."
3,Not Enough,"I like jazz very much and Miles Davis is an important person for me. Especially, his music in cool jazz era is unique and he is the most dominant person in cool jazz. All the songs, except last two are about his cool jazz performances. Last two songs are about his fusion times. His cool performances are good, especially I fall in love too easily and I thought about you are the best songs in this complation. However, the songs are not complete each other and there is a discontinuty among the songs which makes this complation not a very good one."
4,animated,"Lewis lived from 1898 to 1963. He completed an extended metamorphosis from confirmed atheist to theist to Christian in 1933, and then plunged into writing and lecturing, subtly as well as overtly, to push for a u-turn back to old-time, literal Christianity. Lewis, in fact, found a lot to like in the medieval mindset. He wrote in numnerous genres as well as apologetics. Some writers have credited him for leading them toward, or more seriously into, Christianity.Professor Marcos's lectures concentrate heavily on explaining and summarizing (sometimnes in substantial detail) Lewis's writings, rather than providing much biographical background information. Marcos's presentation has the sense of a very animated sermon. I get a strong impression he reveres Lewis."
3,Pressed Fower Pictures and Citrus Skin Decorations,"Practical guide to making petal-point pictures, tray decorations, paperweights, calendars, memory pictures, samplers, citrus skin decorations and seed mosaics. Covers framing, backgrounds, mounting, designing, and more. 8 color illustrations, 51 black and white photographs and 15 how-to drawings. 228 pages hardcover"
5,Love every track,"I received this as a gift in casette format. Now I want to get the CD. It's lively, fun, excellent. Good dancing music."
3,Una Imagen en el Espejo,"La historia de unas gemelas con diferentes personalidades, una muy indepeniente y extrovertida, la otra seria y muy apegada a su padre.Una de las gemelas es obligada a casarse con un hombre al que no ama, pero la otra gemela usurpara el lugar ella."
5,A Great Read!,"This book of profiles is well written and very engrossing. Through a quick and lively prose, the author brings each of her subjects to vivid life right there on the page. I've long been curious about many of the people behind the voices on public radio and this book scratches that itch. I feel like I know them all so much better now when I tune into their programs. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and recomend it highly to all fans of public radio."
3,Don't buy this album..,"An early run of some of their best material, Blues for Allah marked a continuing step up in the Dead's evolution at the time. The opening trio ""Help -> Franklin's Tower"" is a smooth flowing progression you can sit back and drift with over and over. ""Solomon's Marbles"" and future staple ""The Music Never Stopped"" can leave anyone floating with a smile on their face. And finally there was ""Blues for Allah"" itself, which was like a further step in the experimentation of ""The Other One."" Weird, spooky, and oddly beautiful.However: don't buy this album. I'll just repeat what's been stated a couple times already: One From the Vault presents the entire album, along with several other songs, and it's full of the life and passion the Dead brought to the stage. The studio material sounds like a rusty first rehearsal in comparison."
3,"""Franlin's Tower"" and ""The Music Never Stopped"" are great.","""Franlin's Tower"" and ""The Music Never Stopped"" are great, but the rest is kinda lame. The last song has this dark part in it that is weird and scary. It gets 3 strars because of those 2 great songs."
1,Blues? Allah?,"It has to be their worst recording ever. There is no Blues to speak about, but a bunch of amateurish free jazz folk pop nonsense that goes nowhere. And if they for some reason where muslims, allah itself would have taken his name from these recordings. Just affle."
5,Bonus Track Instrumentals!,"Of all the bonus tracks appearing on this remaster, all but one areinstrumentals; and all these instrumentals are far better than very good; so if you (as I do) like to collect Grateful Dead instrumentals, the remaster of Blues for Allah has a generous selection."
4,That lp cover is The Bomb,I am not a really great GD fan but the have a kind of American folk rock style music and it makes you want to get an old moonshine jug and toot along with them. I really would like to say they got this good old fashion bluegrass rock an roll started
4,Blues for Allah,I was disappointed when I loaded the CD onto my Ipod it was distorted yet played fine on my CD player.
5,My favorite Grateful Dead studio album,"Recorded during the band's break from live performing(mostly)this album captures some of the bands best in studio performances, The perfect ballance between studio slickness, overdubs and jamming. The songs certainly became more jammed out in later live versions but what is here will keep you going."
3,Blues for the Almighty,"This album has a weird name.It is a nice album but slow paced. The opening title is very sweet. It has 2 parts coming one after another. I have listened to that song live and believe me you can not distinguish between the two. These guys are great when it comes to live jamming. The second song is good but not their best. I particularly like The Music Never Stopped. King Solomon's Marbles, Pts. 1 & 2 is another good song."
4,not too shabby,"this is a pretty decent grateful dead album. it has a great beginning, starting off with help on the way/slipknot! a great jam song with a good rhythm. Next is Franklin's Tower, a song that feels the same as Sugar Magnolia from American Beauty but is better. the next three songs are alright, and are highlighted by The Music never Stopped. From here the album only goes downhill. The title song, ""Blues for Allah"" is really weird. Its just strange, and has no beat or instrumentals. All it does is have really bad and strange vocals. Blues for Allah doesnt deserve to be the title song, and the first two songs (maybe the first 6) are better. Overall this is still a pretty good Grateful Dead cd and worth buying."
3,"Get ""One from the Vault""","The music from this album is great, but the performances are weak. If you like these songs, check out ""One from the Vault,"" it has every song from this album and then some (including a great and powerful performance of ""Sugaree""), all live with plenty of improv, and played with all the fire and conviction that the Dead somehow never managed to bring to the studio. . ."
4,Very Nice,"I have had silver Scorpio items in the past. I know how easy it is to bend a claw or a leg. When I got these the back post's were slightly bent, and the one big claw on the one earring was slightly bent out more than the other earring. After a few little light tweeks and little bend I got them to look the same and to sit flat on my ear lobes. I really do like them, they are not too huge, just right. (from past experience I know you cant bend the silver too much, or it will snap, just a heads up.)"
2,too bad,Great design. A bit cheap on drawer backing. Big problem is the red dye powders off in the drawer and gets on everything. Actually had to line the inside of it with contact paper. Would not put anything of value in it. Glad I have it because could find no other with this design but really not worth the price if you can find anything else.
5,Love this set,"The extras on this set are great, as usual the commentaries give you an chance to find out what might be involved/behind the makinga show such as this."
1,Doesn't fit X!!!!!,"When I was buying it from Amazon, I specify 2004 Infinity G35X. X stands for ""all wheel drive"" I was very exited a week later to receive this Borla exhaust. O boy, I was very POff to find out with my mechanics, after we removed my old original exhaust that this one fits only regular g35 not g35x... Amazon shame on you. Lets see how many hoops I need to jump through to return this product."
5,Great Product - Bad Price,"I ordered Kiehl's Facial Fuel after it was featured in GQ (11/08 issue, Jimmy Kimmel on the cover). It's a great product and my skin always feels fresh for hours after applying it.After writing the above review, I realized that I bought the 4.2 oz version through Apothia for a considerably lower price (29.50). Unfortunately, it is no longer available. BatheandBeauty needs to adjust their price."
1,"Product is awesome, this item is a rip-off","I love Facial Fuel, it's an excellent moisturizer and I've been using it for years: I rate it on a par with Biotherm's, which is almost impossible to find in the USA.So, the product itself, gets a 5-star.However, the pricing here is a complete scam: on Kiehl's own site [...] you can get a 4.8oz for the price of this 2.5oz, and they even offer free shipping above $50 (the shipping charges on this item are also a real rip-off).The 2.5oz is around $20Avoid."
4,Great Pick Up!!,"This face lotion is great for that fresh feeling. Ideal for that out of the shower freshness!! Clean, fresh and not grease!! not a matte finish but a nice, healthy glow....for me this a great finish to being clean! 4 stars because I wish it had even more of a cool feeling!!"
1,DO NOT BUY! This is a trick,"This lotion is fantastic, but if you buy it you're getting ripped off.Why?It is the identical lotion as L'Oreal Men's Expert Hydra-Energetic Anti-Stress & Fatigue All-In-One Moisturizer, which costs a fraction of the price.LOREAL Mens Expert SPF-15 Hydra-Energetic,Anti-Stress & Fatigue All-in-one Moisturizer - 1.6 OzL'Oreal owns Keihls.I have both products in front of me, and they are chemically identical, and look and smell exactly the same in my hand."
2,A little too greasy for me,"I tried this and the MenScience Advanced Face Lotion. This one has a nice scent, but it's got a much greasier feel than the MenScience. I'd recommend that brand over this one."
1,Bad,Read this advertisement well. It's very expensive to purchase and is cheaper on Nordstroms website for a larger quantity. Also not as advertised. I received the UV SPF cream. Not what I wanted.
2,Some errors in the book,"While the historical content is acceptable, the author makes some blatant mistakes mostly in the photos. In one photo he shows the site of the Wilcox train robbery near a present day railroad sign dispaying the ""Wilcox"" whistle stop. However, the actual train robbery happened about 12 miles northeast of this location. The train tracks were moved 2 years after the train robbery and the actual site is along a raised abandoned railroad grade. Another errors is the photo of the jail cell where Butch was held in the Wyoming Territorial Prison (now a state park). While the building walls are original, almost nothing inside is. The whole place was gutted at one time and used as a barn. A reconstruction of the prison was done, so the ""prison cell"" shown is not the actual cell, but a reconstructed one."
2,More travel diary than biography,"This book is less about Butch and Sundance and more about the travels of the Irish author. I got most of my history questions answered but I wasn't that into his anecdotes, which account for over 50% of the book. Well done, if this is the kind of thing you're looking for."
1,Didn't work,"The first time I turned it on, it started smoking and it burned up. I never got to use it. Total waste of money. I have had this brand before and they have been fine but not this one."
1,Didn't Last Long,"Used this hot air brush for four months and it died! That wasn't even using it every day--maybe once a week. I've had others like this that have worked very well, but this particular product did not last!"
1,Disappointed....,"This product is just okay. I had hoped to get one like my hair dresser with the firm bristles, this one does not have the firm bristles like I expected; the bristles are too soft so they don't really hold the hair when you are styling, you have to wrap and hold yourself. I was disappointed and would not recommend it.Update: I have now had this product roughly a month, it does not shut off, have to click the yellow switch on the plug to cut it off and even in the off position when I press the red switch, it comes back on.Further update - Jan 31, 2013 Do not buy this item, I have thick hair so I would dry it almost completely with a hair dryer then use the brush to add body and curl under ends, did not use enough for the problem I have had. I finally got it to turn off and it would come back on, worked fine for one or two uses then the burning smell started right after I turned it on yesterday and smoke was coming from. I believe this model is more of a risk than anything else..."
2,Loved it for 5 weeks,"My daughter has this product and it has worked well for her. I loved it until it died. I read the other reviews and still bought it thinking the purchasers did something to cause the machine to fail. I wish I knew what that was, because it happened to me too and now I must go through the aggravation of returning it."
2,Burned Out,"Ordered my hot air bush in August and it burned out last night. Really bummed because it worked so well and seemed well made, bummer."
3,Amazing! But...,"I absolutely loved this brush. I have stick straight super fine hair and it dried my hair quickly, gave me much needed volume, and even let me give my hair some shape and curls! UNFORTUNATELY I bought this brush just 3 weeks ago and after regular use the motor burned out this morning. It was extremely hot and stunk up my bathroom. Definitely a fire hazard. Hopefully I can find something similar that's a little more reliable."
2,Dang,"I was hoping this would work well and last a long time. It did work great for about 2 months - then the unit started getting hotter and hotter and started scorching my hair. I still used it but had to run it on low, and let it cool down every few minutes. Within another month or so it stopped working - overheated and ""fryed"". (No fire but Extremely HOT. Good thing I was in the room or I'm sure there would have been flames eventually.) I believe this device is poorly made and Dangerous!"
4,love it,I'm a hairstylist and I love this thing. It works on dry hair and gives great volume and finishes the ends nicely. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because they tend to overheat and die. I've gone through 4 in 3 years. Keep in mind I do use it several times a day. I have gotten many a client atticted to it.
1,Do not buy from this seller! Brush was USED!,"I love this hair dryer. I had one that lasted for 4 years and when it broke I decided to go with the same dryer.I was eager to receive my hot air brush in the mail. However, I received the Hot Air Brush not in it's original box. It was in a plastic sleeve instead. I pulled the brush out of the sleeve to find it had hair in the brush. This product had obviously been used. This is absolutely disgusting and I do not recommend buying from this seller."
4,hot tools blower brush,Works great I wish this tool came with interchangeable brush sizes so you can change it for different lengths of hair. It just comes with one brush that comes off and you can use just the blower part. I find I would need smaller brush barrel on top of my head and bigger brush barrel in the back.
4,this hot brush has make my life a bit easier,"i bought this brush because i had trouble dryin and braiding my dauhter hair, every time i wash it, it was always hard when i finish blowing it, and she would be crying everytime i begin to braid it, so i decide to try something different, and brought the hot brush, and when i it use it on her hair, her hair dry quickly and is was soft, i braid her and she didn't even notice, all she was asking me mom u soon finish."
2,low quality,"It has good heat, but the whole thing seems like any moment its going to stop working. I think my hair is to long for it and I have shoulder length, maybe shorter hair would work better. overall just disappointed in the quality would not buy this item again."
1,What a shame it didn't work,"Like TeaKayPea, I found this brush to be great on my hair, but faulty overall. It handled my thick, wavy hair without a single snag. And I was thrilled -- for all of three minutes. Then it burnt out and despite my best efforts to revive it (letting it cool, reseting the plug, etc.) it never worked again. Don't waste your money.UPDATE: While waiting for a shipping label to return the brush, I tried it one more time. It had ""rested"" for a day, and this time when I plugged it in it worked! I'm holding on to the brush, but not my breath. We'll see how it behaves going forward..."
2,Great while it lasted,"I purchased this item in September, only to have it burn up in less than 4 months. I used the hot air brush only occasionally, perhaps 2 times a week. It did a nice job styling my hair, and I think the anti-static ionic feature made a difference. Unfortunately, the motor never ran an even speed. The second to last time I used it, I thought I smelled smoke. The last time I used it, I definitely saw smoke. That was enough for me to throw the item in the trash. As a result, I just can't recommend this item.For a period of over twenty years, I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair. Unfortunately Conair no longer makes the model that I used. I took a chance on this Hot Tools item as a replacement, but this Hot Tools product was more expensive AND failed in 4 months.This was my first time with a Hot Tools product. It also was my last.I just purchased a different Conair product. At least I know it will last."
4,"Speedy drying and styling... even for my fine, impossible hair!",It takes some practice but once I mastered it... combining drying time with styling time speeds up my morning routine quite a bit. I left off a star for how loud it is... that is a problem with hair dryers in general. The highest setting seems especially loud to me.
1,Motor burned out in 1 month - BUYER BEWARE!,"So disappointing. I loved using this, but the motor burned out in a month. I used it 3-4 days a week for about 5 minutes each time, so the quality is very poor.I should have paid more attention to all the other reviews that also mention how the motor burns out very quickly."
2,Burnt out in about 5 months,"I should have listened to the other reviews and purchased the original Hot Tools Curling Brush (i had one of those for two years and i dropped and broke it)...when i saw this one had a Cold Shot button, i was thrilled and decided that it was just a coincidence all those other units burnt out so quickly. Not so. I used it about 3 or 4 days a week, to style my hair after drying it with an average drier, and sure enough, one day it made a sad little noise and started smoking...totally on the fritz. Don't waste your money, listen to the reviews, or be prepared to buy another one in about 6 months. :-("
1,Dangerous!!,"Sadly, ten uses and it over heated. The plastic section of the handle became extremely hot and tripped the circuit. No reviving this thing. When it worked ...it was fabulous, but certainly not worth the danger."
2,Poor quality overall,"I have owned two Hot Tools hot air brushes in the last 5 years, same model. My first one seemed to have gotten a short in it so I had to stop using it because it would stop. I thought I would try another one to see if this one pooping out was a fluke. I have used my second one even less and it didn't last half the time as the other one before doing the same thing. Poor quality which is highly disappointing from Hot Tools. Customer service is weak in that the warranty isn't long at all and then you have to pay to have it fixed and shipped back. Love the brush otherwise. Just not worth your money since it is short lived."
3,This product was ok for me,This product was just ok for me. I got it for the concentration nozel so that I can just blow out my roots (I have chemically relaxed hair)and stretch time out between my relaxers. I have seen women use it on you tube really well so maybe it how I am using it. I think it has potential to be a great product and depends on your skill. I found it easier to flat iron.
2,SHORT Lived!,"Liked it at first, heating unit starting getting ""extra"" hot withing two months. Too hot for hair, started ""frying it"". Unit burned completely out less than 6 months. Will not purchase this brand again."
2,great design/bad manufacturing hazard,"I love using this product and have had several because I can't find a similar product that works as well, but it's so badly made, it is probably a fire hazard. The motor on my last one lasted 8 months, and when it went it flamed and shocked me when I touched the end of the unit near where the cord comes out. You can prolong the motor's life by drying your hair with a hair dryer, and then just using this for styling afterward. It's still the fastest easiest thing to use to style. I need to stop buying them and will look for something else."
1,Did NOT work for Dell 1600N,I tried to use this for my dell 1600n I get a flashing light that keep saying no Cartridge not sure if its defected or not ...either way im just gonna order the Dell Toner to avoid this frustration....
4,Toner for Dell 1600N,The toner arrived on time and was packaged extremely well. I have used it for about a month now and have no problems with it. I am extremely happy with the price I paid. This is a great alternative to the original Dell cartridge which is quite exoensive.
1,Beware poor imitations,This company's toner cartridges are so bad that they actually killed two office printers. The cartridge was so badly constructed that it leaked toner all over the inside of the printers resulting in paper jams that not only made a mess of the office but ultimately resulted in a piece of paper wrapping entirely around an inaccessible roller. The printers are useless now and have to be replaced. Saving a few dollars on the cartridge has cost me several hundred dollars replacing two dell printers!Do not buy these products!
1,Bad quality control,"Inserted this new toner cartridge into my printer, attempted to print a project and it promptly dumped its toner guts everywhere. Needless to say I am not impressed. I didn't have time to send it back so I extracted the toner and yield counter chip and refurbished my old cartridge. So it wasn't a total loss, but cost me a good bit of time in cleanup and labor moving the toner and chip."
5,A great book,"As a speaker of fluent Spanish, this book was invaluable in getting subtle nuances, learning false cognates and distinguishing between meanings from one country to another. It's a fun read as well. I have about 5 copies for my own references and to give away given how valuable and well-written it is.What I don't understand is how a $7 paperback is going for $40 to $140 on the Internet!"
5,One of a kind- Buy it.,"This book is indispensible if you want to gain insight into colloquial Spanish without the luxury of living in a Spanish-speaking country for a few years. Not only that, but it's fun to read. I pick it up and read it over and over. I'm actually on my second copy having worn one out.¡Cómpralo ahora mismo!"
5,I can't say enough for this reference,"This reference is not only extremely useful but fun to read! I have worn mine out and only wish there was a more up to date version. Also, I hope that in future editions the author will cover more of Latin America. Perhaps even publish an edition of Latin American usage exclusivly.Update: I recently noticed this book is selling used for almost a $100 dollars!! Although it is a fine book and reference, that is ridiculous! How sellers can charge so much for a small paperback book is beyond me. There are many other fine Spanish grammer and vocabulary books and if you are a serious student you will find them.Good luck"
5,Grayfox,Excellent book. Lots of history in this one and full of the love of God. Loved the story coming from a man's point of view.
4,neat info,Happy Feet is the nickname of the boy in this story. We listen in as his father tells him about the night of his birth. It was also the opening night of the Savoy Ballroom. In the back of the book are helpful author's notes that give us a brief lesson on the Savoy Ball Room and famous dances of the times.I learned a lot by reading this book. I had never heard of the Savoy ball room before reading this book.Children who are interested in the history of dance will enjoy this book.
5,viaje mental,"Este album es en mi opinion el mejor logrado por este exelente duo, con la cantidad de expeimentos que se realizaron con exito en este album nos encontramos con un record inigualable que mezclaritmos de rep, funk, r&b, soul, etc. Ademas del la gran propuesta lirica que nos incita a viajar en un mundo exotico creado en la imaginacion de dante y emanuel.Un album altamente recomendable para aquellos que gustan de la buena mezcla de ritmos , algo como nunca antes habian oido.P.D. el track ""ruegame"" es una de las mejores caanciones de amor jamas escritas."
1,WRONG COMMON BOND,"Don't be fooled, this is not Common Bond of 1983 through 1986 produced by Doug Doyle, great group. I went to the Common Bond myspace, and for sale is this wrong Groups music, this Country Gospel music, rather than the punk rock groups web page. Both a different Common Bond than the group I am looking for. I am thinking about starting a group called Boston or STYX."
4,Great New Music,"Sara Lee's debut is all that a listener could expect from a first album and more. Her long experience as a bass player with everyone from Gang of Four to Ani Difranco is evident in the songs on this album, as they are well thought out, powerful, and full of great bass lines. Her unique brand of funk-pop is refreshing, new, and sure to draw the listener into whatever song may be playing. The songs on the album give the listener both a chance to contemplate and an opportunity to dance. With strong songwriting and ever stronger musicianship, 'Make it Beautiful' is a gorgeous offering, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the music of James Brown, Ani Difranco, or even the Indigo Girls."
1,"Hype, hype, hype","This is what we call in the business a hype.a young female woman (also from former yughoslavia) singin and playing slide guitar as well. Wonderfull production behind it, and there you go: another cd you'll find in the second hand bin. Have fun listening to it the first time. Get bored the second time.

5,The Best Crime-Fighting Show of the '80s!,"""Stemwinder"" has Lee and Amanda running from the Agency while trying to prove that they are not double agents for the Soviets. This is the long-awaited episode where Lee finally admits his love for Amanda."
4,"a good collection, mastering is mediocre","This disc contains a lot of good tracks (and alternate mixes) from the days before EBTG became a dance music group. I really love the alternate mixes of ""Take Me"" and ""Twin Cities"".I will point out, however, that if you bought this disc in its first version, there is no real reason to ""upgrade"" to this remastered version. The same problems appear (small tape dropouts in a couple of tracks, and the strange cutting in and out of the lower frequencies on ""Each And Every One""). I was hoping that they had actually remastered this disc from scratch and improved it, but such is not the case. The remastered ""Eden"" disc doesn't suffer from the same audio problem on ""Each and Every One"", so clearly it isn't an issue of the source tape being damaged or unavailable."
2,bow roller,Dimensions of this roller are less than advertised. a bit skimpy in size but roller roller material is non marking. would not buy it again and get full size 3 inch roller.
4,An excellent introduction to the topic,"An exciting tale of the journey of these two adventurers and their crew is retold through sufficient text and plentiful images. The photos are striking and abundant and a great way to lure kids into reading the book. It's both educational and entertaining to learn of their trials. However, if you are looking for expansive, in-depth text of every moment, you should check out other books that are a reprinting of their diaries. While this book is thorough, it is really just an introduction to the whole adventure and easy enough that you'll probably finish it in just a few sittings."
5,Beautifully Illustrated Account of the Corps of Discovery,"This is a wonderfully illustrated retelling of the incredible expedition to the West and the Pacific Ocean undertaken by the Corps of Discovery, that amazing group of men (and women) who trekked over four thousand miles from St. Louis to the west coast and back over the course of two years from 1804-1806. The story of Lewis and Clark's journey to the West has been told many times, but never in such an accessible and enjoyable format as this. It is pepppered with excerpts from the expedition's meticulously kept journals and vivid descriptions of the unknown land and the native tribes they encountered in their travels into the vast Louisiana Territory. This book is bursting with beautiful photos, paintings, and drawings that draw the reader into this truly amazing story of adventure and discovery that shaped a young new nation."
1,Spiraling downward,"This music is a bit disturbing. It kind of makes me realize that there is something special to creating good music and this does not even come close to it! Without knowing who this artis is (or was), I get the feeling that it is someone with a lot of time on his hands, a dwindling stash of money, no job and a family that has probably distanced themselves from him due to their own serious dysfunction and quest for fleeting material values. I would suggest this person keep dreaming, keep writing and keep recording, but do so in the privacy of his own basement.Being influenced by Pink Floyd and Tom Waits does not mean it's going to be good! One of a kind is often best left alone! This is absolute garbage!"
1,cheese,"I can't believe a record company would actually record and sell this. He's a terrible actor, and his music sounds like a kid wrote it. Total cheese. And the funny thing is, he really thinks he's good."
1,I want a refund,"I saw Corey and his band perform the entire album live at the Universal City Walk on Saturday night (6/27/09) - the concert was free - but I still want a refund. I want that hour of my life back. It was like watching, and listening to, a train wreck. What made it all the more awful is when we realized he was actually serious about this.The audience stood in stunned silence for the entire performance.While I am sure that the man must have talent that lies somewhere, it isn't here. The people giving this one a good review must be die hard Corey fans. There is no other explanation.We finally walked away and had dinner within earshot of the show. The only thing that indicated that it was over was not the applause and screaming from the audience, but the blessed silence of them leaving the stage.Go back to acting my man. Whoever told you, 'that track is a keeper' is a celebrity suck-up sycophant. Really dude... this could destroy the remnants of your career. Do you paint or something?"
4,"Second Album, Second to None","Still Searching for Soul is Corey Feldman's second album, but his first with the Truth Movement band, and shows some great promise.Layered to be played in order, similar to Pink Floyd's albums, with a flowing story that develops across the tracks, this is not an album to be picked up occassionally.This semi-autobiographical work really helps to put in some perspective the pressures that are placed upon young actors, and how hard it actually can be for them to grow outside of this place. Feldman has done a fine job of giving us, as listeners, an insight into what can happen to children in Hollywood.Using a mix of media, including music, conversation, and news soundbites, Feldman and Truth Movement give us a rich tapestry of experience from which to experience the trials and tribulations of young Hollywood.I look forward to Truth Movement's next album."
1,Ummmmmmm...No.,"I heard he had an album, so I had to see if Amazon had any clips up. Holy s**t! This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. The music is barely karaoke-worthy, the lyrics are remedial at BEST, and the singing...well...I won't even go there. Come on now. Find something better to do with your time, Corey. Oh, how the mighty have fallen..."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHA,"Boo hoo hoo! I'm Corey Feldman and I've got all this money from all these movies I made a few years ago. Well, maybe not as much as I did at the start- maybe if I hadn't wasted it all on cocaine then maybe I might be pretty well off. So I think I'll vent all my emotion and anger via the source of atrocious ""goth"" music, with clever titles like ""De-pressed"" and ""Spiralling Downward"" (hmmm... NIN's ""Downward Spiral"" anyone?)This sure is some life you've cut out for yourself Corey. Please, for your own sake, STOP MAKING RECORDS. STOP RIGHT NOW.If you wanna check something out with a bit of emotion then check out Far, Deadsy, Mineral or Hundred Reasons. These band channel pure emotion and energy through their instruments... whereas Corey does not. Corey whines like a little b**ch and moans about how everyone in the industry turned their backs on him. Well Corey it happened 10 years ago- GET OVER IT!Thank God Macaulay didn't make an album."
1,Please Read my review Corey,"This is a great example of how a person will cling on to any remaining fame left to him and not care that it makes him look like an idiot.Corey, i have seen what you have typed and you really need to take this whole situation and accept it. Your not a musician, there is no hope that you will ever become a bad one, let alone a good one.Your carrer is over as an actor, why not do what other child actors do when they have become has beens? Drive a forklift, Be a Security Guard. Do drugs, i hear your very talented in that.I will say that I thought you deserved an academy award for the whole ""Home Alone"" saga and You also did very well with ""The Good Son""."

1,rjaygo,This version released by REELCLASSICFILMS is very poor quality. It is difficult if not impossible to watch. Do not waste your money.
4,An L.A. Story,"A really surprisingly suspenseful movie. Basehart plays the sociopathic thief perfectly. He makes for a truly creepy and riveting villain. The rest of the cast, with perhaps the exception of Bissell's performance, is pretty forgettable, but the film's star seems is L.A. itself, its buildings, neighborhoods, underground tunnels. The shots of the city in the beginning are quite breathtaking. I think the movie would have benefitted from developing the characters a bit more, but the film succeeds as a sophisticated chase story. I love watching classic mysteries where the police don't have DNA evidence and all of the sophisticated resources the characters in shows like CSI do; they primarily use their wits, and old-fashioned methods like dusting for fingerprints. ""He Walked by Night"" is a worthy predecessor to crime television and to movies like ""Zodiac."" Highly recommended!"
2,Not quiet at all,"We've had this purifier for a little over 12 months now. We clean it as recommended. About 4 months after we purchased it the fan developed a buzz when it is on. It has just got worse as time has passed. So much, in fact, that we have to place the unit on its side in order for the buzz to go away. Not sure how effective the unit is on it's side, but it is in a small room so we are not asking it to purify a large area. It seems to be cleaning the air alright, but the durablity of the machine is its downfall. Look for something else."
1,"Not quite ""whisper quiet""","Like the previous reviewer, I found the sound produced by this purifier to be unnacceptable. I should preface this by saying that I've been sleeping next to a very loud fan all summer and actually enjoy the white noise. The problem is, the noise that this purifier makes can only be described as a loud arhythmical plastic grinding. After running it for about a week and the noise actually getting worse I've decided to return it."
4,Awesome Radio - Great Range,"When I received this radio I was a little wary, but after some initial tests, I found this to be one great radio. The range was spectacular, and the clarity was outstanding. I have tried many radios, but have never experienced one this great. Get the optional battery pack, you will not be disappointed. I use this ATVing every weekend and it makes communication very easy."
2,"2 1/2 STARS - Starts off good, then gets lame.","The first few scenes from this film were very interesting and will make you want to keep watching, but you will be quickly dissapointed with a predictable and unoriginal story that is full of plot holes. Mediocre at best. Much better films in the same vein are ""Goodfellas"" and ""Blow"" with Johnny Depp. Nicolas Cage was much better in ""Matchstick Men""."
2,Leftist antiwar fantasy,"In this movie it is a given that guns are bad, gun dealers are worse, and war is the baddest thing imaginable. Hitler,Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao and every other dictator would agree - all of them prevent or prevented citizens from owning weapons. If you think they want this for the safety of humanity, there may be a spot saved for you in a ""Peoples reeducation farm"" somewhere. Nobody gets to be free or stays free long if they are not willing to fight, and the fighting is much more painful if you do not have weapons. This country was not given to us as a birthday present by the British. Without guns the struggle would have been even more painful. Up guns and gunrunners. Screw Hollywood."
2,GREAT ACTING -----------------,"Great Acting by all who were involved -------- subject matter - violent!Language was offensive! Do these guys [and females] ever grow up and become more literate?Sad to realize that this goes on in this world. Probably a great terrorist supplier.Based on actual facts? More than likely true.The content is something we would like to deny - the ending, probably happens all the time.Hate the thought that some of our government officials are that corrupt.I got the message but can't say that I enjoyed the movie - will not keep, what a waste."
1,Could have been great.,"Not a bad movie, but watch ""Deal of the Century"", a much better movie about and funnier."
1,never again,"I got this 3 times in the mail, every time in skipped an froze in the same exact spots. they said it was a manufacturing era and refunded my money, but still have not got to watch it all the way thru"
4,A very underappreciated movie,This movie becomes more relevant with each passing year. Its one of Cage's best performances and a great movie that didn't get the attention it deserved at the box office.
5,One of my favorite Cage films ever!,This is truly a wonderful movie! It is a great movie! I can watch this over and over. I highly recommend this movie to adult audiences!!
4,Excellent Film + Good Message!,"I'll get to the point (I'm not a fan of 2-page Essay reviews) and I don't like ruining movies for fellow watchers.I thought this film had a great/complex story line. It definitively keeps you hooked, it is well narrated and character driven. The story-line plays out decently, taking you through an emotional roller coaster from love & hate to action, betrayal, cold-blooded murder, loyalty, courage etc. . The cast is rich with well seasoned actors, Ethan Hawke was awesome but Nicholas Cage was impervious.Overall in the end the movie had a great message and it actually opens your eyes to what's really going on in the world..."
4,nice,"What I liked about this film is that in some ways, it was like a documentary. Nicolas Cage often gives monologues in films, probably because he's so good at them. In watching this film I got the impression that Nicolas Cage's character was real and what he expressed is actually what he felt. Nicolas Cage is most often cast as a troubled or conflicted character. In this film he was a little conflicted over being an international illegal arms dealer. Jared Leto played his drug addict brother who for a short time worked with him in smuggling arms to different countries.Like most who work in jobs where what they do is at least a little questionable, he aways had a good come back argument to make himself feel better about what he's doing or rationalize it. ""all my weapons have safety switches on them"", ""cars kill more people than fire arms"", etc."
3,No extra feature?!,I like this movie. But it is not the movie I have problem with. I just can't believe that it doesn't have extra feature in Blu-Ray disc.
5,Great Movie,I like true story movies. So when hubby told me about this movie I knew I had to have it. It is a really good movie. Nicolas Cage is a great actor. This is a must see movie!!!!
2,Lord of War,"It felt very slow and more like an interesting documentary. It started off ok and ended decent, but the entire middle was not what was expected; it was narrated every step of the way."
3,I was good... at first.,"In the begining it was good, going at a good pace, very awesome. However in the middle it becomes slow and borning, finally picking up at the end. When Jared Leto's character is seen in play.I think it would be a good movie for Leto fans for the only good stuff is when he's around.But I think you still need your hand on the skip foward button."
4,good movie,"good subject matter for those interested in gun running, well put together, reminds me of Blood Diamond with Len DiCaprio"
3,Lesson: dealing weapons to dictators is baaaad.,"""Lord of War"" is somewhat entertaining but ultimately forgettable. It's hard to identify with the experiences of an international arms dealer, and the one-dimensional characterizations don't help either. I'll take Con-Air any day."
4,A Few Empty Cylinders Short of Greatness,"Andrew Niccol's account of International arms dealing never fails to entertain, but, alas, doesn't hit the homerun. I have been a big fan of Niccol's previous forays in paranoia. ""The Truman Show"" and ""Gattaca"" are masterpieces. Heck, I even liked ""S.I.M.O.N.E"". Despite some bullseyes Niccol doesn't seem to focus his arguments here, therefore, he can't ratchet the sufficient outrage against the death merchants in our midst. What redeems the film is Nicolas Cage's charasmatic turn as Yuri who enters into arms dealing as a lark and dicovers he's just so damned good at it. A great scene in the film is where Yuri is stuck in an African village with a planeload of munnitions. With Interpol on his tail he proceeds to empty out the contents of the plane by giving it away to the natives. Not bad, but could have better."
3,"INTERESTING, BUT A CROCK OF BULL****!","If you watch this movie taking this movie as it is intended to be taken a ""black comedy"" then you should enjoy it. Cage is great and the story is interesting. Some very cool visual effects are used in this good,but embellished story. Much better than I expected."
5,One of the Best movies I have seen in a while,"whoever has negative things to say about this movie i really can't understand it. The story is original and captivating, the acting is above average, there is plenty of action and suspense, and it is not predictable at all. Overall this is a must-see movie for anyone i think. Again, one of the better movies you will see in a while."
4,"Great movie, could use the format better.","This is a phenominal movie. I am a huge Cage fan so I picked it up without having seen the film before. I was very happy with it. Unfortunately it is JUST the movie on this disk and it is remeniscient of the early days of DVD where you only got the movie, then later you would be prompted to buy the special edition with special features. It would have been nice to have had some special features on this disk, it really could have been an interesting bit of extra.Overall, a great purchase, especially if you don't care about special features."
5,MAMA PUT MY GUNS UNDERGROUND...,"I thought this was a very good film. Well written filmed cast and acted. Very dark humor. I myself would have used Lawyers Guns and Money by Warren Zevon and Knockin' On Heavens Door, Bob Dylan on the sound track."
3,Lord of War,"Nicolas Cage brings another of his fascinating portrayals of enigmatic characters to life in this dark story of an international arms dealer who has traded his morals for money.The story line weaves its way through a series of dangerous encounters, where life has little or absolutely no value to his customers, to a climatic staging of events that makes Cage aware of his own mortality.If abstract violence and gory bloodshed is offensive, this is definitely not your cup of tea."
3,Mildly interesting,"Okay, so it's sort of based on real events, but who knows to what degree?Too much effort in trying to be an artistic movie and too little actual just plain good movie...It's a shame 'cause Gage is a great actor, when he can just act, say in a flick like Matchstick Man, the movie is a lot better than in stuff like this or the silly movie with Jolie stealing cars, etc.The premise of gun running is interesting, so if you are interested in that, you'll find the movie decent enough. If you don't like seeing violence and want to see better character development, skip it."
3,Aspect Ratio,"Can someone that has recently received their Lord Of War SE DVD from Amazon tell me whether they are shipping the re-issued Disc with the theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1? It would be too expensive to send it back from Europe if it's the wrong one. Nice Digipak though! i really loved the movie, great irony and realistic portrayal of the power struggle. Thank you for anyone's help!"
3,Kind of boring,"This is a story told by Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) as an international arms dealer. This seems to be a movie with an educational and ethical mission about the international situation in arms dealing. It includes the fall of the Soviet Union to conflicts in Africa. Cage goes through his paces as an arms deale, with no real excitement. Cage aquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who uses selective denial, and Ethan Hawk represents the law that is always on his tail. Eamonn Walker does a great job as Andre Baptiste - leader of an African nation who plays Cage's main customers. Walker is great at playing a bad guy. This film is emotionally cold in that it is told from the viewpoint of someone who caters to cold blooded killers. It is intense at times, some tension and enough action. This movie deals with ethics, however it is not a fun movie. It is not a feel good movie."
2,Not what I expected...,"Here I am thinking that I am going to settle down with another great action packed thriller...NOT!! This movie was not something that I would be interested in seeing again. I found the plot to be pretty good, but the rest of the movie as it played out was BORING!!! Cage's narration throughout the flick was annoying too!! I was just waiting for this movie to get better, but it never did. You may find yourself just sitting there bored to tears with this one, as I did!!"
1,Completely falsified in order to vilify,"Hate to break it to you all, but the film is not even close to the true story. The real man this film is based on was an ITALIAN from ITALY. His story had absolutely nothing to do with the United States. Oh, and our troops did not leave piles of working M-16 Rifles abandoned in Grenada or anywhere else for that matter. Absolutely unreal how Hollywood will do anything to turn the facts into fiction in order to trance the masses. Michael Moore would have been proud, but at least Moore does try to apply some balance and facts. This thing was nothing more than a fictional story. It also left out the fact that the three countries who are thick in arms deal ings seem to not have ""USA"" applied on them anywhere. I could go on and on about it, but hey, at least now you know so you are not like so many who are saying ""yeah, this is TRUTH!!"" So be sure to do your research, and don't believe everything you hear even though you really, really want to."
2,More like a documental,"This is a very slow movie and it seems more like a documental about war, geopolitics and weapons trade. There is almost no dialogues."
1,WHEN WILL THIS MOVIE BE AVAILABLE ON DVD,"TOO BAD the movie Lord of War is not available on DVD!Amazon lists 4 DVDs of this movie, but NONE of them is a DVD of this movie.There are only 2 different FULL SCREEN versions -- 1 is 1.33:1 for older TVs and 1 is 1.78:1 for newer TVs -- BUT there is NOT 1 that is 2.35:1 which is the aspect ratio in which this movie was shot!TOO BAD this actual, whole movie is not available on DVD -- only 2 PAN & SCAN versions!BOYCOTT this bastardization of this movie!"
1,worse than the dvd version,"Extremely poor transfer.. quality is basically DVD level, but with added jerkiness from the transfer process. Do not purchase this version, get the DVD instead, or wait for a real transfer."
1,Not what I expected,"After looking at a couple reviews for this, I thought I had found a good movie. It's mildly ""OK"" at best. I wish Hollywood would stick to movies and leave politics alone!"
5,Lord of more than War,"One of the most under-rated movies I've seen in years. Nick Cage is superb, and the tongue-in-cheek humor is truly hilarious while simultaneously striking a chord with reality. This is hands down great work. Great film."
4,Did not know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.,"Upon my son's recommendation I watched Lord of War. I had never heard of the movie so I was a little skeptical. I found the movie extremely well done and enjoyed it. As disturbing as the portrayal of the arms business was, I was even more captivated by the fact that what was in the movie seemed that it could be very reflective of real life. I would recommend the movie."
4,A LOST SOUL SELLS BIG GUNS,"Andrew Niccol directs Nic Cage as weapons of mass destruction salesman Yuri Orlov who sells ordinance like the medieval church sold indulgences; spare us your morality, please, for church and Yuri, it's only about money.Very dark humor pervades this shocking story of the personal and professional life of a Ukranian man who is in the business of supplying weapons to any country or rebel that can afford them. For a while his beautiful wife (Bridget Moynahan) is clueless and his drug-addled little brother is a poor choice as a partner. Amoral and frightening, this glimpse of the black-market gun trade is only bearable by the slight peek of Yuri as a human being and not the monster he has almost completely become. This is one of Cage's better roles. Cage seems to understands how the relentless drive for success can kill the last vestiges of a lost humanity."
3,Hey! Its entertainment,"Funny to read the 'righties' and 'lefties' searching for political messages and hidden agendas... PEOPLE!!!!! This movie is ENTERTAINMENT!!!! So, with a grain of salt, realize this movie is SATIRE and BLACK COMEDY with gun running as the vehicle.With that disclaimer out of my system, let me say, i really enjoyed the movie. Nicholas Cage, when allowed, has an incredibly wry sense of humor."
5,Eye Opening!,"True to life portrayal of what takes place in the ""underground world"" while everyone else goes about their suburban business. Here the movie shows us how the ""arms dealing"" involves the politician, suburbian housewife, immigrants and poor youths living in developing countries. We get to see who does most of the work, who benefits and the danger it involves for those at the less powerful end of the equation. I can't quite call this entertainment....nothing to laugh about here. The five stars are for the acting (Nicolas Cage rocks) and the story telling."
4,Not what you think,"It not really a shoot em up. It's not much of a laugh. But what it is, is an under-seen, thoughtful, entertaining cautionary tale of our world. See it."
3,GUN SHOPPING,"Obviously intended to be a dark satirical look at the amazing world of gunrunning, Andrew Niccol's LORD OF WAR offers the average viewer an inside look at not only how and who sells guns and weapons, but why. Nicolas Cage stars as Yuri Orkov, a Romanian immigrant who works his way to the top of the gunrunning trade, taking on a fashion model wife (well played byBridget Moynahan), his cocaine-addicted brother (a convincing Jared Leto) and a competitor (Ian Holm, cagey as always). Cage's character is really an antihero but with his sharp wit and self assuredness, a likeable one. Ethan Hawke has a supporting role as Jack Valentine, a federal agent who dogs Cage but can never come up with enough evidence to put him away. The movie's ending is chilling in its implications.While not a movie to really admire for its thematic content, LORD OF WAR is very well done and Cage is extremely good in this difficult role."
4,Very good movie,"I thought this movie was interesting and had some great action in it. Nicholas Cage was awesome, as always."
1,not presented in it's original screen ratio,"Beware, the so called widescreen edition presents the film in a 1.78:1 ratio whereas it was shown in a 2.40:1 ratio in theaters. Lion's Gate version of pan and scan"
2,Absolutely No Action,How could a movie about an international arms merchant have virtually no action.???? Nicolas Cage's performance was fine but the movie was too slow moving for my taste. Downright boring at times.
1,shipment never arrived,"Shipment never arrived. First two months the system did not allow to claim about the shipment because it would still be on time. Now claiming about it is no longer possible, as the order is older than 60 days."
2,Just to boring for words,"I sat there and a 1/2 hours into this movie, I looked at the case and saw that it was about 2 hours long.Now you may wonder why I finished watching this movie and the only reason was because, I wanted to see how it ended, but would I run out and buy it, no way. not even for a $1.00The only good thing about this movie, was Nicholas Cage, but he was not enough to save this movie.So, save your money, unless you enjoy boring movie."
2,Documentary,"It is more of a documentary in nature than an entertaining movie - kind of slow one. The blu ray was just average. Nicolas Cage justifies his role. I have great respect for soldiers (irrespective of country), I couldn't accept the movie much."
4,"Excellent film, but poor Blu-Ray","The film is one of the greatest of all times, but there are no extras whatsoever on this blu-ray release. If they had included at least a commentary track, I would have rated this five stars. Given the low price I would still urge you to buy this. If you are a fan of Blow or Thank You For Smoking, then you will definitely want to add this one to your collection."
4,This one was robbed,"I remeber seeing the previews when it was in theaters, but I never got around to seeing it. Anyway I rented it and it was one of the better movies that I have seen lately.The story is very dark, but it is one of people achieving success only to find that when they get there it is not all that they hoped that it would be. It also showed how even when you think that you are above everything you are selling little pieces of your soul along the way.I could have done without the plot line involving Yuri's brother after he left the ""business"" the first time, but he needed to be brought back in to complete Yuri's arc.The movie has also motivated me to investigate the final line on the screen indicating that the movie was based upon actual events. I knew all along that there were black market arms deals going on, but the movie illuded to things much larger than what I had guessed were going on.Ultimately, I think that this movie deserved a bit more acclaim than in received."
4,"Excellent movie, but only average blu ray quality","I still enjoy the movie quite a bit, but I was disappointed that the blu ray version didn't deliver the full promise: the picture quality was rather good at times (e.g. bullet & cartridge scenes), but only average when shooting outside e.g. in the scenes in Africa which could have been amazing if shot properly. Audio was good, though.Summary+ Movie, its characters and storyline+ Audio- Picture quality should be better on Blu Ray"
5,very entertaining film,"You can never go wrong with Nick Cage. Plus, based an an actual person, makes it all the more fun to watch. Thoroughly fun film."
4,Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life,An excellent biography on John Dillinger. The authors did their homework well! The book features the outlaw's life from beginning to end and it would be an wonderful edition to any Dillinger reader's book collection.
4,"Solid, No-Nonsense Gangster Epic","Co-written by Robert Cromie and Joseph Pinkston, perhaps the world's foremost authorities on this particular outlaw, ""Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life,"" is a factual, credible, informative biography of one of the most celebrated criminals in the annals of crime. No sensational revelations are unearthed, no secrets revealed, no outlandish accusations. Simply put, one of the better Dillinger books written (and I don't say this because I happen to have an original copy autographed by Robert Cromie in my possession)."
4,philosophy for the modern world,"Robert Johann SJ calls himself an applied philosopher. This is not easy bedtime reading, but for those who persevere through prose that at first brush may appear dense, but which is actually very lucidly written, the profundity shines through. Studied meditations on the human condition bring together disparate strands of humanism and existentialism to shed light on what it means to be a person."
2,A Tale of two CDs,"I was updating my Xmas music collection and got this CD along with several other other Putumayo Xmas selections. This CD is similar to ""Christmas around the World"" that was issued 3 years later. This CD has a few (2-3) good songs and the rest are not even vaguely recognizable as Xmas songs. The later released CD mentioned above kept the few good songs and added several more very good, xmas appropriate selections. I can only guess that many felt the same way that I did about this CD and Putumayo took notice. While this CD is 2 stars the other is now 4.5 stars. Pass on this one, get ""Christmas around the world"" (red cover) or even better ""A Jazz and Blues Xmas"" from Putumayo.Merry Christmas."
4,"Nice box, affordable price.","A nice tool box at an affordable price. I have no complaints. I knew the imported wood and conctruction would not be as nice as my dad's 1948 Gerstner. It is hard for me to justify the cost of a new USA made Gerstner, but this imported product allowed me to get a very servicable wooden tool box."
1,Cheap Chinese knockoff,"I'd rather have a quality built American made Gerstner 30 years old than this display of poor craftsmanship built with Chinese slave labor. It's a sad comment on the state of America when a company like Gerstner would allow their image to be tainted with inferior products.Here are the things I noticed within 5 minutes after taking it out of the box:Key lock does not workDrawers are not fitted properlyFront cover does not slide freelyName plate (cheap quality) crooked by 1/16"" and off center by 1/4""---Stevie Wonder could have seen this one from across the room!I am extremely disappointed."
5,5 stars for being a hardcore metal album,"In the hardcore category this album earns 5 stars. Hatebreed are the best hardcore metal band out there, like it or not thats a fact. The riffs are super catchy Jamey's voice are on point. The music is empowering and angry. What more can you ask for in a hardcore sound. Supremecy is one of my favorite songs on here. A very catchy groove. Mind over all, good change over riffs. Defeatist, great guitar breakdowns along with Jamey's awesome lyrical message.None of the songs sound the same and for those that say the last three hatebreed albums sound a like I suggest you unclog youre ears, theyre all different. Especially in this album where JJ's vocals are passionate and the guitars have a broader range"
1,The formula has gone sour,"I love hatebreed, but it's now time to progress the style. This would've been a great cd if they had not already done the style 3 times in a row. The music sounds forced and generic. If this is the first hatebreed record you plan on buying, don't buy it. Anyone of the hatebreed records listed below will leave you more than happy, and will definitely be your moneys worth. As terrible as this album is, it's still worth seeing them live.Rise of Brutality, Perseverence and Satisfaction is the death of desire are worth the money."
2,Bit of a let down...,"After hearing Perseverence I was totally hooked on Hatebreed - the blend of brutal drums, riffs & lyrics were like nothing I'd ever heard before. Rise of Brutality was awesome too... but Perseverance is still their benchmark in my books.Was super-keen to get out & buy this cd, and when I played it in the car for the first time I was REALLY disappointed - almost all the songs sound the same (well, the drums do anyways). I found it nowhere near as initially inspiring as the previous 2 albums. After listening to it a few more times I realised that the lyrics are sensational - as good as ever, but it seems as if the music side of things were rushed and not much thought was put into it. Really disappointing.Highlight of the album is ""Spitting Venom""."
4,Hatebreed evolve and its great!,"Was I the only person thinking Hatebreed were starting to get boring and put out songs which were simply too similar. I bought the Rise of Brutality out of the blue one day and liked it but it had a rather short life span in my cd player. Then I read that the latest offering from them was very stong and decided to take a chance with it and I was pleasantly surprised! Hatebreed have changed ever so slightly and aren't quite as repeatitive as they once were. For anyone that previously had given up on them I say just give this album a chance. I really enjoyed it from start to finish! But don't worry, they are still as hard hitting and agressive as ever!"
2,"Everytrack runs together....sorry folks, it's true","Hatebreed is cool, but this Cd something is wrong with the production or possibly it is the songs themselves. Cool riffs, of course the vocals are strong, but man everything sounds alike .....kinda like one big giant song......and I find it impossible to remember what track was what.....Sorry folks....it's true.For some earthshattering, fist pounding, aggresive metal check out that new SkinnedAlive Cd when it comes out in a couple weeks by Skinlab."
4,Best work since Satisfaction =,"Whoever said that Rise of Brutality is better than this album needs to have their head examined. This album is full of energetic riffs and furocious beats. Jasta's vocals seem to be fully recharged with the aggression and angst that were more than prevalent on ""Satisfaction = the Death of Desire."" This album is a must for anyone that is a fan of hardcore and is the best release of the past 2 months. Easily."
1,IM GONNA BEAT URE *SS RAWRRR!!!!!!!,"Seriously Jamey Jasta, give up the image. Your not tough, you wont beat us all up, your music is not ""br00tal"", and you still live with your mother.Do not listen to Hatebreed, do not wear Hatebreed shirts, do not go to Hatebreed shows. It makes it seem like theyre actually good, or that Jamey Jasta has friends."
4,Metallic Hardcore How It's Supposed To Be,"If there is a hardcore band that I can appreciate these days for their musicmanship and originality, Hatebreed has my vote. This is REAL hardcore, no fashion involved here. The drumming is excellent, and Jamey Jasta sends actual messages with his lyrics. And I say ""metallic"", because Hatebreed may not exactly be considered a metal band, but they have the definite influence. This is a great record full of pure aggression. Recommended."
4,Hatebreed - 'Supremacy' (Roadrunner),"Most recent offering from this in-your-ugly-mug New Haven, CT based hardcore metal band. Also, this was the first CD of theirs I've ever heard. Just caught them on tour with Type O Negative. Whew! After the show I attended, I'm honestly amazed the club's main floor remained intact. Honestly, being in the crowd was sort of like being in a South Park episode - remember the one where Cartman and Kenny build their own tree house and the eventually end up up having a mosh party? Ha-ha! Tunes here that I thought sort of stood out were ""Defeatist"", ""Give Wings To My Triumph"", the h-e-a-v-y ""Immortal Enemies"" and ""Spitting Venom"". Even though many of this disc's cuts sounded a bit similar, I still liked what I heard. Might do a lot for fans of Unearth, Slayer, Death Threat and Killswitch Engage."
3,"Same Old, Same Old...","I will make this short and sweet,there is nothing original about this CD,or anything else HATEBREED has done. Ther last three CD's have all been the same heavy riffs over and over. Yes,it's very heavy in your face,but it never changes and after a couple of times,it gets OLD!"
2,Hatebreed trying to immitate Hatebreed,"When Hatebreed initially ""made it big"" with their record 'Satisfaction is the Death of Desire', the entire hardcore scene was flush with crappy bands trying to immitate Hatebreed. This record sounds like Hatebreed is trying to immitate themselves."
1,Bad brush heads,"The cups are great, work well for us. My disappointment is with the brushes. 5 out of 10 brush heads have sunk into the metal thing that joins them to the handles within a month of using them."
3,No Spill???,"Hello,No SPILL???? The issue I have with these paint cups is that the lids fall off easily. This isn't good when you have a 2 year old playing with paint in your living room!!! If you could make the seal on the lids a bit tighter, allowing older children to remove it but impeding younger ones from spilling paint everywhere, that would be ideal. Thanks.Lianne"
2,Loose lids. Brushes not durable.,"I bought these paintncups and brushes as a joint gift for my 5 and my 2 year old. In theory, this set should be really great-- paint brushes that match corresponding spill-proof paint cups, with lids to save unused paint. As a previous review mentioned, the ""cap"" lids are NOT airtight. They are designed to fit over the inner ""spill-proof"" lid, but the caps are loose fitting and allow the paint contained within to dry out quickly.The brushes are also of poor quality. The first time I washed them, using only soap and water, bristles were falling out all over the place! Also, two of the brushes fell apart altogether--the metal cuff completely detaching from the plastic brush handle.In summary, this product would be great if it were better designed, and maybe if the brushes were made with better glue or something."
5,Debra,Since it's not a Melissa & Doug brand I wasn't sure if the paint pots would fit in the Art Easel tray that I got. They fit perfectly in the trays.
2,Disappointed,The paint cups were fine but I did not receive the matching brushes. So the cost was way too much just for the cups. I would have done better to purchase these items in a teaching supply store.
3,too many cups,realized that kids will never use more than 3-4 cups at a time. brushes are too thick and take a lot of paint.
4,Great paint holders for kids,These paint pots work great. Easy enough for a 1-year-old to get a paint brush into and out of without spills. Fits in the paint holders of the Melissa and Doug wooden easel. The lid then flips over to seal the cup and I have kept unused paint in the cups for several days.
3,The lids don't stay on very well,But other than that they are good. I like that there are enough paint brushes for the cups and they all match.
3,No spills & no frills............,"The paint brushes are certainly not intended for ""fine"" art. The brushes are very coarse and large. Per the paint cups, two of ours were cracked. It took an hour to get them to come apart from one another. My husband suggests that they were likely packaged while the plastic was still hot from the manufacturing process leading to the locking fit and cracks. Otherwise, they are good paint cups for their intended purpose...no spills. Use one for a water resevoir and paint brush cleaning is minimally messy as well."
5,The best!!!,"I have sensitive skin and this is the first face wash that has ever worked for me. It cleans without drying or over-moisturizing my face, removes my make-up and I have no allergic reaction to it. I also have a hard time finding fragrances that I don't react to. This one causes no reaction other then pleasure, it smells heavenly. My face is cleaner and clearer then it's ever been. Will never use anything else!"
4,Executive Decision,"Executive Sanction By David ComptonThis novel is a wonderfully exciting adventure that takes you deep into the dangerous world of espionage, sex, and politics. Greer Whitaker is a young and exciting campaign manger who seems to be making all the right moves, that all changed when his work takes him to Europe and he is thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse. Whitaker, a very dynamic character goes from the simple campaign manager to the all out action adventure hero, who wins you over and saves the United States from disaster.Throughout his travel he is confronted by evil drug lords, international conspirators, and beautifully deceitful women. These combinations of people and the deadly game that Whitaker is playing lead to an all out adventure that leaves one to ponder why this book isn't a movie. This is a great book that stirs the imagination and also the blood. I highly recommend it."
4,Another Clancy wannabe.,Too long with an over abundance of plotting. His principals are well developed but become tiresome with time.
4,Useful Book for Addictions,"The role obsession plays in the problems of of drug and alcohol abuse, overeating, gambling, sexual promiscuity, etc. is explained and suggestions made for overcoming such obsessions."
4,"Straightforward to install, Powerful unit","This was a no-brainer to install and is so far working fine. The only gripe I have is that the motor and fan unit is a little more loose in the mounting tube then I'd like. If I accidently bash it with my head it tends to slip, which causes the blades to hit the sides of the mounting tube. The suck/blow/on/off switch is very accessible and the unit is built solid and is as attractive as an ugly aluminum fan housing can be."
2,Should get more for the price,The first fan I received didn't work Amazon was great about returning it and sending another one. The second one worked good for about a week then the batteries died. I replaced the batteries with some good quality rechargeables and so far it's working good. The instructions are not easy to follow.
2,"Bad instructions - Installed, doesn't work","The instructions were so bad I went to the net, expecting something better. Nope same stuff. There is a white plastic part that covers the screws for the battery. Not shown in the instructions. Once I got it together and istalled - doesn't work. The night light is super, fan doesn't work."
5,VERY ENTERTAINING,"I first read ""Still Mr. & Mrs."" by Ms. McBride. After reading and loving that book, I purchased Baby, Baby, Baby. It did not disappoint. Ms. McBride's characters are wonderful, the dialogue is witty and the story is romantic. If you like Nora Roberts, Jayne Ann Krentz, you will love Mary McBride."
5,Good sampling of what to expect at her dance retreats,"The first DVD shows many cultures and religions using dance to enter different mental states so it is a pretty good quality documentary. The second DVD shows her five rhythms method in action using some of her better dancers from her classes.I bought the DVDs before attending a weekend retreat. She and her son are very loving, aware teachers. They were very good at helping us to feel into every part of our body to allow it to dance. Trance can take you below thought or above thought into acute awareness just as meditation can. My intention at the retreat was to drop all resistance to flow. Gabrielle recognized the instant I did that and danced over to congratulate me."
1,WARNING,THIS PRODUCT COMES WITH TWO DVD'S. AFTER WATCHING THE FIRST I CHOOSE TO DESTROY BOTH OF THEM. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE IT 0 STARS.
4,"Not Their Best, Not Their Worst","Political satire is something that either appeal to people or does not. If you don't like it, no amount of talent will entertain you. If you do like it, you savor each bit and are willing to sit through the dross. It helps if the satirists are good. These guys and gals are good. That makes sitting through their work pleasurable even when it not their best work.As with all work of this nature, it helps to be up on current events. The parodies are based upon items in the news. It also helps to be familiar with the American repertoire of popular music. Some are based on showtunes, some are based on rock or country. The sources come from all over the spectrum.IF you do like political satire, its always hard to go wrong with the Capital Steps. They are very talented. This is not their best album but it is still quite entertaining."
4,This is quite a book.,"The novel is, from its shell, seemingly one of Steinbeck's most objective novels. However, analysing this work, you should find that it is in fact a wonderful experiment in psychological writing for mister Steinbeck. The novel analyses mob mentality and the devestation it can inflict, but also is one of the first of his works to include his ""group-man"" theory, that a cooperative group is man. As for souls, they do not exist in an individual sense, only when man is one, together. While Steinbeck ardently disagreed with the tactics of Communists, this ""group-man"" suggests a natural socialism... Also, the book is wonderfully fascinating as a kind of modern-day metaphor representing Milton's Paradise Lost. A great read."
3,Interesting,"The book's imagery of the mob is amazing. Being a high school student, I've been *ever so lucky* to analyze this book and take it apart until it was nothing but mush. The ending offers a lot of interpretation and the book allows the reader to debate about topics of great variety as the book goes on. The book offers vivid pictures to paint in the reader's head. If you read the book, don't go about analyzing it, it just ruins the story."
5,Praise for In Dubious Battle,"Steinbeck, through In Dubious Battle, shows yet again how great a writer he is. In Dubious Battle is a great tale that incorporates the lifestyle of an applepicker with the idea of forming a union. He follows his tradition by keeping the content of his novel in a fashion that portrays a realistic and timely picture of the life that was lived by the workers in the Torgas Valley, and the others around the nation. Mac and Jim (the main characters) provide an indepth look at the times when a union was considered Communist, and themselves being ""Red"" for promoting the idea of striking, picketing and forming a union. Not only does In Dubious Battle include the realism already mentioned, but also has many places where Steinbeck infuses his ideas about the world into his characters. In Dubious Battle is a classic story of the common American worker trying to make a decent wage and live a fulfilling life."
3,Not Steinbeck's best,"""In Dubious Battle"" reads like the last few chapters of Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"": polemical, propagandist, and two-dimensional. Of course, Steinbeck is always a fabulous writer, but this work simpply can't compare to ""Grapes of Wrath"" or ""East of Eden"". The characters are types (the cold-blooded radical, the hot-blooded radical, the straight and simple working-class leader) without the perfect nuances of individual character that one usually finds in Steinbeck's creations. The prose is less poetic than in his earlier novels; if you're the sort that hates Dickens and Hardy and you skipped the rambling descriptive chapters if ""Grapes of Wrath"" I guess that wouldn't be a minus though. But unless you're a die-hard Steinbeck fan, you might as well skip this one in my opinion."
3,Not as good.,"This is novel was an interesting book to someone who is interested in history, but for most others it is rather dry. The main character, Jim Nolan, is at time likable and also despicable. The other characters are not as endearing as those from ""Grapes of Wrath"" or ""Of Mice & Men"". If you are looking to read a GOOD Steinbeck novel then read one of the aforementioned, but spare yourself from reading this novel. It reads quickly and is easy to understand, but it just doesn't grab you like his other books. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the highly accurate portryal of migrant life in the 1930's."
1,In dubious preaching,"I know it's considered sacrilige to be critical of the great John Steinbeck, but this book is an insufferable soap box bore. If the characters didn't repeat themselves so endlessly, 100 pages could have been shaved off, and the book would be better for it. There was not one character in the story I cared about, and I was relieved to reach the end."
5,"IN Dubious Battle - A great, but mostly overshadowed work by Steinbeck","An example of Steinbeck's early work with migrants and "" The Party "". Solid and moving. Pre GOW. Super edition and with an excellent introduction and suggestions for further reading. LImited in scope, compared to the epic journey of TGOW, but just as powerful, and with the same fine work."
5,Steinbeck never disappoints,"John Steinbeck's ""In Dubious Battle"" is set in a fictional valley in California as a group of migrant apple workers go on strike. The story is propelled along at a quick pace as the situation worsens with each passing day. This is Steinbeck's first in his labor trilogy (""Of Mice and Men"" and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" followed). You can see the beginnings of those classics in this one. I read it in a day on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon."
1,Desktop charger--NOT!,"I bought the desktop charger along with the 2-way radios--it never charged properly--either didn't charge the batteries or overcharged--I finally just went out and bought some rechargable batteries, and a charger at my local drug store--much less hassle overall--"
3,Might not be for beginners!,This book is full of notations that I think are for advance students in music education or for piano players looking improve their skills. Enlarging the front cover shows the type of notation and fingering that will be found. It's not obvious from the title of this book that this book might not be for beginners who are trying learn on their own.
3,Peskanov's Russian Technical Regimen is Better,"This book is useful, but for a much fuller and far more effective treatment of this school of playing, I recommend the ""Russian Technical Regimen"" books by Alexander Peskanov, and the companion video, ""In Search of Sound,"" which demonstrates the techniques employed. I know the books are available on Amazon but I'm not sure about the video. Classical Video Concepts does handle the video. Peskanov studied in the Ukraine under teachers who were lineal ""student descendants"" of Leschetizky. I'd also suggest Googling Peskanov, and becoming familiar with the work of this wonderful concert artist who has a real heart for developing young talent. I've had several opportunities to observe him both performing and working with students in master classes and in private lessons, and he is a genuis with a heart of gold."
5,The Storekeeper's Daughter,Brunstetter has created an excellent portrayal of life among the Amish. The burden of responsiblity and a yearning for a life beyond basic beliefs causes a young woman to search her heart for what God purposed for her life.
4,Couldn't put the book down,"This book kept me up until 2 am one morning, it's that good. But, I was really looking forward to getting to the end. This is a wonderful tale of some of the experiences of the Amish. If you're looking for a good Christian fiction, this will definitely delight your senses.I would classify this book as the type you sit on the porch, with some lemonade, and read."
4,Interesting ...,"I have only just begun reading Amish-themed romance stories, and I am currently on Wanda Brunstetter's ""Daughters of Lancaster County"" series. I just completed reading the first one in the series, ""The Storekeeper's Daughter"", and am into the second one, ""The Quilter's Daughter"". At first, I thought that this story was too boring and depressing, but I hung in there.(Had I been Naomi, I would have been outta that door a long time ago!) When I finished the first one, I had to read on to the second one because there were too many loose ends from the first, and I wanted to know the outcome! It is good reading, but it doesn't explain any of the Amish traditions or customs as in ""Plain Perfect"" by Beth Wiseman. Overall, I rate this series as pretty good, and interesting as well."
3,"Good book, good series, not ""great"".","Okay, overall, I liked the Daughters of Lancaster County series. Reading the first one - Storekeeper's Daughter - definitely made me want to read the second, then I *had* to read the third. It was more about needing closure on the storyline begun in book one than loving to read her books.With that non-glowing review as a starter, I would still recommend this series. I appreciated the display of faith in God's direction despite the world falling down around them. I have not read many books about Amish culture so I found that interesting.My 3 star rating is because I thought they were fine books, just not on my top 10 list."
3,Lenka,"As a 23-year-old future younger wife, my only complaint is that there isn't a more current version of this book available. I understand that in 1995, the Marla Mills phenomenon was new and that Cindy Crawford and Richard Gere were exciting, but with 15 years worth of retrospect I feel that something is missing. Perhaps she should update this with more pertinent illustrations from pop culture.Otherwise, this book has proven invaluable in helping me pick up octogenarians at various functions and projecting the ideal mix of independence and crippling co-dependency that is necessary to make these relationships work. This book was very helpful in making me realize that the best course of action lies in pursuit of the bitter divorcée and not the grieving widower. Thank you Beliza!"
1,A feeble attempt to imitate R. Don Steele by a woman,"Lame, inane, she's trying to ride on the coat tails of How to Date Young Women for Men Over 35 and falls off in Act 1, scene one."
1,Just awful!,"Between a recent widow lusting after every man she meets, terrible dialogue and absurd characters, I could not get through this book."
2,Interesting,"The storyline is interesting, but the writing was not as engaging as The Pumkin Seed Massacre. Characters were developed in a sort of choppy way. I felt disappointed, having read a number of her opther books."
5,Remember when Perry Mason was the #1 lawyer?,"Geeze, how lawyer fiction has changed from those days!And now that we're in the age of John Grisham and Scott Turow, Michael Connelly tries his hand at writing a legal thriller and succeeds once again in rewarding the reader with a novel that hits at the gut level. Connelly is not easy on his characters. They make mistakes, act on wrong assumptions, and bring about tragic consequences and then have to live with themselves.This is Connelly at the top of his form bringing us a new central character we hope to see more of. Mickey Haller does of course return in THE BRASS VERDICT and hopefully will continue as a periodic lead character.I'm not going to go into the story because that has been adequately covered by other reviewers. I do however recommend this as a book that hits as I've already said at the gut level, but also at the cerebral level. I don't think this is a book you'll forget nor will you regret having read it."
5,LOVED it!,I read a lot of novels...many of Connolly's Harry Bosch novels too.This book grabs you and doesn't let go. The main character is fun to listen to and be around then plot and characters are really compelling. One of the best novels I've read. Highly recommended!
4,Job Well Done,"Given Connelly's background and previous courtroom scenes (Concrete Blond and A Darkness More Than Light) it shouldn't surprise anyone that he's done a superb job with presenting a ""likeable"" defense attorney. While Connelly does take some license with criminal procedure, it is still a very realistic (and entertaining) account of the criminal justice system.Adam Grupper performance brings it all together for a great audio book."
4,"Solid, but expected from Michael Connelly","This is a pretty good page turner with excellent characters. Michael Connelly always tells an interesting story and makes the lead characters very relatable one way or the other. So, probably an average Michael Connelly novel, and overall a good read for the suspense/mystery genre."
1,I couldn't get past the premise,"This was my first Michael Connelly book, and I bought it based on the very positive reviews. I just couldn't get past the basic premise that paints a defense lawyer from a jaded cop's perspective. I've known hundreds of defense lawyers, a few of them pretty sleazy, but no one's really like the protagonist of this book. It's such a false stereotype. I kept on trying to get past it, but just couldn't. A big disappointment for my first attempt at Connelly. For what it's worth, I've never been inspired to write a review before, + or -, but had to express my opinion about this book."
1,Not at this price,"This book sounds very interesting, but I'm not paying more than the paperback price for a Kindle edition. This publisher needs to face reality."
1,TAKEN,THE AUTHER IS VERY GOOD IN HIS OTHER BOOKS BUT THIS ONE WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AFTER 2 CHAPTERS IT WAS TRASH
2,"Simple prose, improbable events","I thought the first half of the book was okay, but then it just dives into improbable character behavior and events. Written so that a 3rd grader would have no trouble reading it."
2,Poorly punctuated,"I bought the Kindle version of this book. I was quite disappointed in the quality of the editing. I noticed several punctuation mistakes and the occasional misspelling. It was also more expensive than the mass paperback version of the same book. As for the story itself, it seemed to me that the author ran out of time to write a credible finish. It was rushed and unclear at the end. At one point I also noticed a lack of continuity in the locations in the story. It was a bit of a shame because this has the makings of a good book. However, it did not live up to the good reviews it got in some of the press."
5,Good legal thriller,"One's esteem for the trial bar hits a new low with this one. Michael Haller is a criminal defense lawyer who works out of his Lincoln Towncar. Getting criminals lesser sentences or getting aquittals for the right fee. The driver of his Towncar is an ex client. He is even still friendly with his two ex-wives: a prosecutor and his current secretary. His latest case involves defending a real estate mogul, who is accused of raping and beating a hooker. Things are not what they seem and one thing leads to another. All in all a satisfying read."
3,Fun,"Fluffy, but entertaining. This is the first Connelly book that I've read. I'm pretty sure he would make a pretty good defense attorney. Also, I watched the movie after reading the book - it is EXTREMELY well adapted, follows the book almost exactly.It's not the most well written novel that I've ever read, but like I said, it's fluff. If you have a long airplane ride or a day at the beach, try it out."
5,A good read,"I enjoyed it. Held my attention straight through. Just ordered the next book of the series ""The Brass Verdict"" . I look forward to reading it."
5,"Not Harry Bosch, but still a great read","Everyone's first question about this book will be: how does it stand up to the Harry Bosch novels?Heave a sigh of relief. Connelly is simply a wonderful writer, perhaps the best writer of thrillers today. ""Lincoln Lawyer"" may not be a Harry Bosch novel, but it's enthralling nevertheless.The main character, Haller, is a lawyer. Naturally, your first worry is that this is one of those ghastly lawyer books which glut the marketplace, the kind (usually written by a lawyer) where the noble, handsome, brilliant lawyer risks his life to save his innocent client from the death chamber.Connelly turns everything upside down. His main character knows his clients are guilty. His one real fear is that he might actually stumble across an innocent client. And then, of course, he seems to.Michael Connelly is a national treasure. I just wish he wrote faster."
5,Loved The Lincoln Lawyer,"Michael Connelly never disappoints me. I thought this book was great.Though I miss Harry I'm always so happy with Michael Connelly's stand alones. The story is very interesting, fast moving and insightful. I enjoyed this look inside a profession that is thought of so negatively by most of us. It gave me a fresh prospective.Mickey Haller is a character that is intelligent, street wise, witty and very likeable. I hope to see him again. And since he's related to our favorite detective I'm sure he will pop up again somewhere. That's another thing I like about Connelly. Those little inside ""knows"" that his fans will pick up."
3,Entertaining Book,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" was a stereotypical legal drama with a seasoned attorney, a client with a story that seems to good to be true, and a few surprises along the way. I enjoyed Michael Haller's character, which is summed up quite well in this statement from the book, ""Much of society thought of me as the devil but they were wrong. I was a greasy angel."" That was an interesting way to describe all the legal maneuvers Haller goes through to defend his clients -- people that society would generally look down on.I thought the book did a good job of portraying the life of a defense attorney, and the story moved along at a good pace. I just didn't walk away from the book with anything more than being entertained, which is not necessarily a bad thing!"
3,Moderate Effort from a Great Writer,"Michael Connelly is my favorite contemporary author. His Harry Bosch novels are unparalleled in the area of crime fiction. I admire him for branching out with other protagonists, but the Lincoln Lawyer doesn't quite suffice when compared to his other work. The premise is interesting, the writing moves along and holds the reader's interest, but plausibility is what is lacking. There are just too many instances in this novel where I could not buy what the protagonist does, or doesn't do. I've never felt that way when reading about Bosch as the protagonist. I'm sure there will be more novels featuring the ""Lincoln Lawyer"". Let's hope he someday rises to the level of Harry Bosch in terms of credibility."
5,WOW! THE BEST!,"I have read them all and I don't know how, Connelly keeps getting better. Of course the how is he is a great writer with a realistic imagination. He is obviously a hard worker and has certainly learned to pace his writing.All that said, this is a bell ringer of a plot. I was hoping for another 300 pages, but that would not have worked with the laconic excellent writing style.I can't wait for the next."
4,My favorite Connelly yet,"This was a good one, a really good one. Great characters, nice suspense. I was fully engrossed from beginning to end and it had me prepped to read the sequel right away. I have read a few books by Connelly and Lincoln Lawyer is my favorite so far."
4,robuster,"Good book,easy read. A true weekender.Looking forward to the next one.A good book for at a decent price how rare is that?"
5,Great story and real fun to read it! Recommand! A+,After reading the comments I give it a try and thanks to the reviews because it was absolutely a must read! I was having hard time to let it go so read it real fast and I was able to see the movie last week and the book is as usual better but I was surprise by the way almost everything is in the movie! Thanks to the writer for sharing this story with us!
3,Lincoln lawyer on roller skates,"I did like the characters and the basic plot. However, the characters were never introduced well. More needed to laid down before the first section tore off in such a hurry. The tempo of the plot was off. The first section was too fast, causing confusion, and the third section seemed like an afterthought. One plot point, Haller's relationship with his daughter was mentioned, but never developed.How he ended up with two ex-wives was never developed. New characters need to be developed. Plot spacing is necessary if you want the audience to folow twists and turns."
5,Don't Miss This One!,"Whether you decide to see the movie or read the book, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" by Michael Connelly is not to be missed! WOW! This is good! Mickey is a lawyer who drives around in a Lincoln (thus, the name for the book). He gets a case which seems like a slam dunk but it's not. This novel is full of twists and turns and a super plot will have you hooked with a fantastic ending! The Lincoln Lawyer is a must read!"
3,"Connelly is no Turow, however......","A quick read, could have been so much better. Enjoyed the Hallen character and his associates. The story was loosely woven and sometimes all the pieces did not fit. The ending was a disappointment, did Connelley just get tired of the mess he created and opt for an easy out? Often a writer will do well in the first half of the story and then, things just begin to either fall apart or at best, not fit together well. I did enjoy Lincoln and it inspired me to run to my old Turows for a re-read."
4,Enjoyable,Mickey Haller is a criminal defense attorney who operates his business out of his Lincoln Town Car. He's called on to defend a rich Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he met in a bar. The book is well written and includes several twists. I enjoyed the read but was somewhat disappointed with the ending. This is the first book in the Mickey Haller series and I plan to read the next.
5,A Real Page Turner,"I don't usually read legal thrillers, but I'm really glad I decided to try this one. The tension just keeps building thanks to engaging characters, snappy dialog and a fast paced plot with lots of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down!"
4,Great Suspense and Intelligent Writing,"This is a really, really good thriller. I think it's better than 'The Closers', too. It doesn't insult your intelligence and it's fairly informative about the legal trade as well. It's a quick read and is enjoyable; no matter what genre you prefer."
4,"Good, but not Great. Connelly has written better","As legal thrillers go, this one was just okay. Parts of the plot were downright silly, but Connelly makes up for it with his great writing. I wouldn't enthusiastically recommend it to anyone, but if you're a Connelly fan, then you should definitely check it out. In the hands of a lesser writer I wouldn't have given it four stars. Probably only three."
5,Can't Wait To See What They Do With The Movie,"First of, I love Michael Connelly. I love the fact that he can write from both sides of the coin, cops vs lawyers. Micky Haller is going to become one of my favorite characters. This book is based on Micky Haller who sends an innocent man to jail and finds out that he is defending a guilty client who actually committed the crime that the innocent man was accused of. The fun of this book was trying to figure out how Micky was going to outwit a truly evil client while still doing his job as a defense lawyer. I won't tell you how he does it but of course you know that things will get fixed by the end of the story. I can't wait for the movie. I was pysched to see the movie but it was more important for me to see Michael Connelly's vision for this story because once a book ends up on the big screen you never know what to expect."
5,Great read & a plus to any library!!,Very happy with purchase. Book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I appreciate the honesty of this seller. Thank you!
4,must read law thriller,This was my 1st Michael Connelly book and it won't be my last. This is a fast paced book that I read in one day. Of course it helps to envision Matthew McConeghy as the lead character. I highly reccomend this book! Well I'm off to read the next book in this series!
5,The Lincoln Lawyer,"This is the first Michael Connelly that I have read and I loved it. Seen the movie too, but loved the book more. I love getting to know all the characters, which is why the book was so good. The twists and turns were great and I hope everyone else likes the book as much as I did."
3,Good but...,"Michael Connelly is always wonderful and the book's a must if you follow him. However, I have to say I was disappointed by the ending which was too much like that of an earlier book in the same series. I hope that Mr Connelly isn't about to become a ""formula writer"" where it's always the same plot - just a different day and some character changes."
5,Great!,Got this for book group. Really enjoyed the main character and his dealings with his less than model clientele.
5,Lincoln Lawyer,This is one of the best books I have read in a while. Finished it in 4 days can't wait to read more by Michael Connelly.
3,Storyline is overused,"This is not his best work. The story starts off slowly, becomes interesting about 50 pages in, and then offers up the bad guy threatening the good guy's family stuff that has been overused to the point it's a turnoff. I read no further. The thing of interest in this offering, the part I read, is how a defense attorney opperates, at least the one Connelly created. His lawyer is most interesting, but this time the story Connelly has to tell is a little too familiar as if he's been watching too much television, or reading other bestsellers."
4,"Lincoln Lawyer, huh","The title annoyed me. Couldn't he have come up with a better title?But overall, it was a really good thriller. Worth buying.Check out ""ON BEAUTY"" by Zadie Smith."
1,Slow moving; doesn't engage the reader; character development mundane,"I'm not sure why this book's been so highly rated. It was the first time I've read Michael Connelly and it will certainly be the last. In comparisoon with other authors like Vince Flynn, Lee Child or Brian Haig, Connelly's story and character development are without punch or interest. The reader is never pulled into the storyline, making you want to turn to the next page to see what develops. This is a yawner that left me wanting no more. If this is typical of Connelly's work, save your money."
3,Movie vs. Novel,"Though the movie is very close to the novel, I have few issues with the movie. The movie failed to show the dissimilarity between the two assault victims, one was hit on the right side and the other on the left side; signifying the key aspect of Roulet's modus operandi."
4,"Good Book, not great though.","i like this, but not the best book ever. Nice characters.If you like this, you'll like this one.Caribbean Moon (A Manny Williams Thriller)"
4,"Liked it, but enough with the Lawyer novels already!","This was engaging reading, I am not going to deny that. I am just tired of lawyer novels. If you aren't then you will probably like this. Reminded me a bit like a light beer version of John Grisham. A good light beer, but still not as complex a storyline as Grisham. A tighter writer than Tanenbaum, though."
2,Terrible Read,Like the movie this was a terrible read from the start to finish! If you watched the movie then you will know how the book goes and its not much better ...
5,Excellent legal thriller,I am normally not a fan of legalese but this thriller was a pleasant surprise. A lawyer takes on the case of a rich youngster who is accused of beating up a sex worker. He discovers that the case is more complicated than it seemed at first. At the same time his fear of becoming too cynical and mistaking an innocent client for a guilty one is severely tested. That's really the theme of the book. This is also a well-balanced book that is neither pro nor anti-lawyer. There is lots of action and interesting technical information about the legal profession. Highly recommended.
5,Is There Nothing This Guy Can't Do?,"Michael Connelly steps off the streets of LA, and into it's court houses, writing a taut page turning legal thriller that brings to mind the best of Scott Turow or early John Grisham. Micky Haller is a criminal defense lawyer who will do whatever he needs to to get his clients off. However he gets more than he bargains for when he's faced with a client who might not be all he claims he is. Consequently, Micky finds himself struggling to defend himself, before he loses not only a case, but perhaps his life as well. A great read that manages to top even some of Connelly's fantastic Harry Bosch novels."
5,Great Book,This was a great book. Much better than the movie which is usually the case. Always nice to be delivered to your Kindle so no problems with delivery.
4,Cant wait to see the movie,"There was a section that dragged but overall the book was good, a lot to keep you wondering throughout book."
4,Lincoln Lawyer,"Great book, a little slow in the beginning but worth staying with. I just watched the movie and it was better than the book."
4,Another masterpiece,"Creating a new major character after Harry Bosch is a brave and successful move for Connelly. The challenge is to make a lawyer who's interesting given most are piranhas, and he pulls it off with the slightly unlikely but immensely appealing idea of a lawyer who works out of his car. The character's a little too dignified for a real bottom feeder, but apart from this it's a fine novel."
5,"My first Connelly's book, now I am his fan","I read this book just before the movie was released. I was(am) under the impression that making a movie out of this wonderful story will be quite challenging. Have heard great reviews about the movie too but I think I would love the book than the movie even if I have watched it. Definitely a page turner, it has got everything, some romance, family, suspense, mystery... everything you want in a legal thriller. I am going to follow Michael Connelly's work after this, have already collected few :-)"
4,DONT READ ALL THE DETAILED REVIEWS!!!,"This is one of those novels where the reviewers on this site simply give too much away- you will enjoy this book so much more if you don't read all the detailed reviews and let the twists and turns surprise you!!!Its a great, fast-paced, exciting legal novel with all the elements for a fun and enjoyable read that you won't be able to put down!As a litigator, I usually shy away from reading this genre (as you can tell by my reviews, most of which are historical fiction), but this wasn't too far-fetched and he clearly has a grasp of the legal system, detective work, and the way things ""go down,"" so to speak. This was my first Michael Connelly novel and I am pleasantly surprised- really looking forward to reading more from this amazing writer."
5,Connelly does it again,"I have loved the Harry Bosch books over the years. This time Connelly takes a break from the Bosche character, but comes up with another classic anti hero in attorney Micky Haller. 'The Lincoln Lawyer' is about the eccentric Haller, who operates in the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles, and instead of an office he does business out of his Lincoln Town car. Mickey does not follow accepted legal ethics operating on the outskirts of the law, which puts him at odds with the establishment. Micky's courtroom scenes are when the fireworks really fly! And his behind the scenes manipulations make for a great page turner. Connelly has a gift for developing characters which make his books more interesting to read then the typical thriller. If you like the Harry Bosche books then should like 'the Lincoln Lawyer!"
5,An entertaining read,"This was my first Michael Connelly novel. I thought it was an outstanding story with well developed characters, a plot that draws you along nicely, and plenty of good suspense. I'm an attorney and I'm comfortable saying that the courtroom scenes were also well done. Connelly's writing is hands down superior to that of Grisham, who tells a good story but is by no means gifted in use of the English language."
5,Delightfully believable,"As a practicing criminal lawyer for 32 years, I have routinely been disappointed in books about lawyers (and sometimes by them as well) where the rules of procedure and of ethics are ignored to ""create"" an interesting story that could simply never happen. Mickey Haller is a believable character and his ""team"" of consultants coached him well enough to please even me. If you can swallow the possibility that a talented defense lawyer can successfully get along with two ex-wives who still care for him, it is a short hop to believing that he can conduct his practice out of his small fleet of Lincolns.Beyond that, this was a good story about a character who is ""fleshed out"" well - even in a book that moves briskly. Thank you, Mr. C."
3,Brothers in Crime,"From a previous review . . .""This novel is definitely on a par with the best of the fifteen stories in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series; any initial disappointment that might be experienced by Bosch's fans when they discover that Connelly has at least temporarily abandoned Harry in favor of Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney whose seemingly guilty clients often benefit from police errors, will almost immediately be replaced by the recognition that Connelly has created another character at least as complex and interesting as Harry. Mickey's persona is almost the opposite of Harry's...""Veterans of the Connelly/Harry Bosch novels will be aware that Mickey Haller is Harry Bosch's (half-) brother (cf. Connelly's ""The Black Ice"").As for Mickey and his Lincoln, the openiong section on the witness Mr Green brought back a amused nostalgia from my old days as a criminal defense attorney . . . otherwise, not as good as most of Connelly. Not sure why.Richard Berg"
3,It was okay...,"For some reason this left an unfinished and disappointing ending for me. Although it was a joy to listen to and kept me occupied while doing other things, it wasn't as good as I'd expected from the reviews. I'll still try other novels by this author, but I hope some are better."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"I deliberately did not see the movie because I wanted to read the book ... don't know if it's the writing or the storyline, just couldn't get excited about this book ... sort of glad I didn't go to the movie now. I usually like this type of book, read most of John Grisham's, but some reason, just couldn't get into this one."
5,Outstanding novel from start to finish,Connelly steps away from the Harry Bosch novels to write a great story about a defense attorney who works from his Lincoln Continental. The attorney finds himself taking on a big case with a big retainer but soon finds himself dealing with doubt and concerns about his client and his innocence.If you haven't read any of Connelly's work now is the time to do so as he is an outstanding writer.
1,Factually INACCurate,"The plot is good. But, other than feeding the ego of an L.A. Judge and a couple of cops, this book is factually inaccurate. The language is inaccurate, the procedures (which the author spends a lot of time on) are alien to L.A. County Courts. It's very frustrating to work in the system every day, and have something portrayed as factually correct when it is so far out in left field it makes the rest of the read annoying."
2,Typical outcome but well written,I broke away from Grisham to see if Michael Connelly might offer something different in the justice/suspense adventure. Every move seemed obvious.
3,The lincoln lawyer,I have not read this yet with other magazines and books to read but other micheal connely books have been good in the past.I have gotten behind on my reading because my mother got sick with cancer and passed away from it in 2010.
2,Childish,"So for starters -and this is not a SPOILER- the DA who goes against a shark in a courtroom is as green as grass and his boss wants him to win the case.Somewhere in the story you'll have a snitch, is he telling the truth?When you know who is the bad guy and what he did you don't have to read nothing about the trial because you'll know what's true and what's a whopper. This is the biggest mistake a writer can do - to show you the bad guy before the trial- and MC did.The other blunder MC did is that this book ends exactly the same way as the previous one."
4,Great new character from Connelly,"In the Lincoln Lawyer, Michael Connelly introduces us to Mickey Haller, an LA attorney who will represent anyone as long as they can pay. Jaded by ""the machine"", he fails to recognize the innocence of one of his clients until it is too late. The appearance of another innocent client allows Mickey to finally redeem himself.Haller's daily lawyer routine and personal life are fascinating. Regarding the law, the author really appears to know what he is talking about. The first half of this book beats anything Grisham ever wrote. It is no surprise that a sequel has been written. However, I felt the story ended up being a bit bland. Some of Haller's actions in the latter half of the book didn't seem to be consistent with his character. Despite these flaws, this is a great character that we will hear more from."
5,Great Read!!!,"I have to say this book was my favorite by Connelly. I would recommend it to anyone, whether u like books about lawyers or not. LL had me readin it til like 3 in the morning. Awesome characters and an awesome story. I'm waiting for The Brass Verdict to be in paperback so I can read another story with Mickey Haller."
5,Fantastic! One of Connelly's best.,"I have read many of Michael Connelly's novels, and aside from ""The Poet,"" ""Lincoln Lawyer"" has been the most satisfying.Connelly is a fantastic writer, and the prose is always clear, concise and taut.This is somewhat of a departure for Connelly, getting away from the police procedural/ detective type of story and focusing on what comes after arrest--the trying of a criminal.The characters are vivid and elicit empathy, and the story is interesting and gripping throughout.What suprised me most was the courtroom scenes, which were as exciting as any scene in any of Connelly's other novels.In the end, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" comes highly recommended by this reviewer, and is hopefully not the last departure by Connelly in to the realm of legal thrillers."
4,"mystery, good read",Well written mystery with an interisting protagonist. A criminal lawyer who wil take any client who can afford him and beliefs his clients are all guilty. Not a real whodoneit more a how and why. Good airplane read.
5,wow is the word !!!!,"This is my first Michael Connelly novel and I am just amazed. where have i been? cover to cover it was an amazing ride full of twists and turns. I really enjoyed reading it and highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a thriller full of drama, suspense and mystery."
3,Great Read!,"If you love John Grisham's brand of lawyering, you will go nuts with this one.It's funny, touching and sad. It has fast paced courtroom drama and a wild suprise at the end, which we all should have seen coming. (Because it's so well done, it's a plesant surprise.)Some things were left a little unclear, but in all it was great fun.The characters were believable and they changed.. they actually learned from mistakes and successes. The protagonist went through a painful rebirth and guess what? Not everything turned out to be perfect. Our man was left with disappointments and regrets. I like that sort of thing -- real life mixed with improbable fiction.It was like a hybrid of Carl Hiassen and John Grisham but ramped up to a ""literary"" take on some ugly characters and situations. I loved the honesty and vulnerability of the tough old, ""seen-it-all"" lawyer.Great book.MM"
5,"Fabulous, as always",This guy is one of the most consistently well-written authors in the business. His stories are never routine or predictable. He has wonderful plotlines and colorfull characters that never cease to entertain. His books are among the very few that I pay the money to buy in hardback. I devour them the minute they are released.
4,Good read,"Well worth your time, not among the very best books I have read but nonetheless very good. Happy reading kids"
4,GREAT CHANGE,He really does know both sides and brings them together seamlessly . As good as Johm Grisham which has been a disappoint lately
5,Enjoyed this book from start to end.,"Good book - fast paced and keeps your interest to the end. The reader is excellent, changing his voice for each person so that you feel involved in the storyline. Only complaint I had was they end and start each CD with music which almost blocks out the speaker's voice."
4,Ride this lawyers Lincoln to the Court House,"M. Connally enters this world of L.A. court house law with an interesting character who buys three Lincoln Town Cars just to get the Fleet Rate. Good investment when he dodges a loose killer who traces this lawyer's every step; like a walnut shell game in L.A.'s MacArthur Park on a sunny April day .... irresistable!Plenty of excitement, some great looking, cosmopolitan women, the work-a-day underside of West L.A. and the hustle of Southern California is captured in each chapter. Hard cover price is ok for this new Connally set of characters without waiting a few months.... that is too long to miss this smart book with today's L.A. rolling off the freeway of pages to tell an ok and more story.Digiman in Pacific Grove"
4,Lincoln Lawyer,"The book arrived in a timely fashion and in the condition stated. I have not read the book yet, but I am looking forward to beginning soon."
2,Bought paperback at Walmart for 5.99,"I love my kindle...... but more and more I am able to find the same books for much less money. And when I am done with my 5.99 paperback I can give it to a friend to read. Why do we pay more for digital books when it is far less expensive to produce a digital book than a printed book? The author......and the book are excellent. I cannot give the 5 star review out of principal, why are we paying so much for kindle editions?"
2,"Decent Plot, Pedestrian Writing",The title of the review pretty much says it all. The story isn't bad but the writing style is mediocre at best.
4,"The best Connelly I've ""read""","My experience with Michael Connelly novels comes entirely from audiobooks, and the actor who reads the Harry Bosch novels is not very good, especially compared to the guy who does Lincoln Lawyer. So that may effect my impression that the narrator of this book, a lawyer, is a lot more interesting and appealing than Connelly's usual hero, police detective Harry Bosch. Bosch is a self-righteous hothead who's too noble in a too-obvious way. Mickey Haller is, by contrast, much more like wily Odysseus than raging Achilles. I like the character's cleverness in working the dramatics of the trial, and the touch of moral ambiguity makes this more realistic and mature novel."
4,A good read,"Keeps you guessing and forces you to pay attention as you read. I;m still not finished with it yet, only 1/3 of the way through. Really enjoying it!"
3,"What do I think about ""The Lincoln Lawyer?""","I've read many novels on this subject and this is a fairly good book. Probably, only my opinion, it has way too many characters and it is difficult to keep up with all of them.I probably would not recommend this as I do not have too many friends who like lawyer stories."
3,Acceptable. Not remarkable.,"'Lincoln Lawyer' is not a bad book. If Harlan Coben had written it I would say he's making great strides in his work. But this book came from Michael Connelly, of whom great things are always expected; and if you think this is one of Connelly's better works then you need to go back and re-read anything from 'Black Echo' up to 'Angels Flight.' 'Lincoln Lawyer' lacks the almost suffocating atmosphere present in (most of) the Harry Bosch books. Worse, 'Lawyer' lacks the depth of characterization of those books. Neither can I commend this book for it's tight plotting because the solution to the 'mystery' was more than a trifle obvious. And yet I had fun reading this book...honestly, it isn't a bad book. But it isn't vintage Connelly either."
5,Great Book,We picked this book for a book club book & it was great. I haven't seen the movie but now after reading I want to watch it. The book has a lot of twists and turns. Its pretty hard to put it down once you start it.
4,Excellent,"Loved this book. Now I can't wait to see the movie and see how they are able (if at all) to correctly convey this story to the screen. I just don't think it can be done, for so much was in the character."
5,Could not stop reading it!!,This is my first time reading a book by Michael Connelly....I loved it...could not stop reading it and CANNOT wait to see the movie!!! I would reccommend it to others!!!
4,Lincoln lawyer,I enjoyed this book. When you start reading the book you think you may have already read because of the similarities between his books but then you know it is different. I like the style of reading from the different characters going from the attorney to his son to his girl friend. Interesting finish and I recommend it.
4,New variables in an old formula,"I saw ads for the movie and decided to read the book. I'm glad I did. Great characters, well written, kept moving, and had good twists. While parts of it were of the same thriller formula, there were enough new elements to keep it fresh and enjoyable."
5,Daisy,I really enjoyed this book. Lots of interesting little sub plots and twists which weren't shown in the movie. The movie I saw was an in flight one and may have had some editting. I will be looking for other books by this author.
5,Possibly Connelly's best non-Bosch book,"In ""The Lincoln Lawyer,"" Michael Connelly provides all the tension, twists, human brutality, and insights into others' lives as he usually sends Harry Bosch to deliver. Mickey Haller is a great new character - smart and committed, but just distracted and honest enough to be deceived...for a while.This is also a great book to start with if you've never read Connelly before BECAUSE all the characters are new and fresh. While I love Harry Bosch, who is in most of Connelly's other books, it can be subtley awkward to read them out of publication order. This book will give you a good idea of Connelly's tough, but smart writing style. If you like it, go back and start reading him from The Black Echo -- it's well worth the ride."
4,Great,"The Lincoln Lawyer was a good read! It slowed at times, but not for long periods. I found that it was entertaining and an easy to read novel. It is always good sometimes to read novels that are simply enjoyable and do not take a great deal of thinking. I would recommend this book to others, especially those readers that enjoy law based novels."
3,More Fun the First Time Around,"I've read it twice now - once on my own when it was first released, and once for book club. The second time around, I decided I really didn't like the ending. I loved everything right up to that point, though. Second reading was June 2011."
5,Love Mickey Haller,"Read this Michael Connelly book first and now Im hooked on Mickey Haller. Connelly makes him a REAL person and all the characters around him are well developed and his friends and family are likeable. Read the Fifth Witness and the other Mickey Haller books. Great, fun reading!"
4,Connelly is a Superg Story Teller,"""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is the second Michael Connelly book I've read, and it cements his reputation in my mind, as a superb story teller. It must be hard for an author to come up with a new plot for a crime novel, but Connelly had me guessing until the end. If suspense is the name of the game, Connelly is a practiced practioner of the page turner variety. As a lawyer, I found the courtroom scenes realistic. The protagonist, a lawyer, is a character of the noir variety, meaning that while being personally flawed, doing justice is important to him. ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is now a major motion picture, and it could be a good one, but I'll pass it up because the cinema of my imagination is better for me than Hollywood graphics"
4,The Lincoln Lawyer,"It drew me in and kept me guessing where it was going. Liking the main character helps, and it helps that he's a flawed--pretty real--main character. Connelly rarely disappoints IMO. I'm looking forward to seeing the film."
5,Lincoln Lawer,Great book couldn't put it down. This is a first for a book of this type and I will be looking to read more of his work.
1,THIS SUCKS!!,"You're led to believe that these are the full-length hits when you play them, but DONT BE FOOLED!! They are chopped up shortened versions of the original hits!! FAME by David Bowie has about 2 min taken out, and the great guitar riff at the end of the Lynard Skynard ""Freebird"" tune is chopped off at the end . .A RIP OFF!!!"
5,Altoids forever!,"I love these things, especially the cinnamon flavor, which seems to have disappeared from stores for months. I knew Amazon wouldn't let me down."
5,Item as described,"This was a ""gag"" Christmas gift. The receiver loved it. Package arrvied in ample time and packaged so as to not upset the contents. Very happy with purchase."
4,Bulk Purhcase - The Way to Go,"Since we go through quite a few of these, it was prudent to purchase in bulk (plus cinnamon is mostly better than the mint ones). Great price!"
5,Cinnamon and ginger together,"Altoids Mints, Ginger, 1.76-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)Altoids Mints, Cinnamon, 1.76-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)I enjoy Ginger Altoids and Cinnamon Altoids together. The strong spice flavors augment and complement each other perfectly. Beware! They are not for the weak of heart or weak of palate."
4,limited availability,"I really love these intensely flavored mints, and sadly I'm unable to find them in any brick-and-mortar retail store anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon!"
5,Altoids,One of my favorite Altoid flavors. I can not find these in any of my local stores - only peppermint and creme de menthe - yuck!
4,Fun,"This cd is really an amazing new work, thanks to the ultimate RIGHTEOUS BABE, ANI DIFRANCO, as Kurt is on her label. Ani is the ultimate in promoting edgy, new experimental music, and I fully embrace her work, especially this new piece by Kurt. I'd definitely buy it again, and again, and again."
5,Nancy Nancy Nancy,This woman is phenomenal! Watching and listening to her perform is spellbinding. A HUGE talent!
5,My hero!!!!,Nancy Wilson. The goddess of guitar live and on vocals too! Who could ask for more? I love Ann's vocal ability and power but Nancy's voice is very soothing and welcoming. This CD was everything and more that i expected. I don't understand why it was never really recognized in the mainstream. Anyone who plays the guitar can tell the true talent that lies in this lady's heart. This is really one of the best releases of the 1990s. I wish I was there when it was recorded!!!
4,A great performance marred by poor sound quality.,"I've always liked Heart and thought I'd give this a listen. Nancy gives a great performance, however halfway through the CD I had to take it out and test it in a different stereo system to make sure my speakers weren't fried. Several of the tracks (track #8 in particular) have such bad distortion that I don't know how they could have released it as is. Anyway...5 stars for the performance, good as usual from Nancy--3 stars for only so-so production quality. The ""it's a live recording"" excuse doesn't hold up here because it was professionally recorded in a small guitar shop."
5,Nancy is wonderful!!!,"I must listen to this album everyday, this is where I get my inspiration. I've loved Nancy since I was little and she inspired me to play guitar. Not only does she play like an angel, but she sings like one also. I'm in absolute awe of her, and she should definitely get more credit for her exceptional talent. Her talent is a blessing, and I'm so happy she made this album, it was long overdue. Good things come to those who wait!!! I was hoping for a video but this will definitely do!!NANCY RULES!!!"
4,Nancy is rock`s sweetheart,"There has always been a special bond between Ann and Nancy Wilson. They were HEART! When I first heard this CD,I thought,ok,it`s Heart without Ann. When I really listened I thought Nancy is clearly the romantic soul of Heart!We must realize this cd,in part,is a love letter to Heart fan`s as well as to sister Ann.I LOVE Heart and my Ann,and so does Nancy!! GOOD WORK!"
4,Pleasant acoustic album,I wish there had been a few more rockin' tunes. None of the new songs really stuck with me. But Nancy has a wonderful voice and overall the album is a delight.
5,Incredible power of Nancy Wilson ....,"An absolute A+, a must have for any Heart-fan ... Nancy Wilson delivers her great power on lyrics and voice, as a comment pretty well writen, not pretensious, just incredible ...."
5,"Really nice album, Nancy is great","I've had this CD for a couple years now and it really doesn't get old. Nancy is great on guitar and her voice is great too, buy this you won't be sorry"
5,"Horrid, pitiful sad",Where do these people come from with this sorry voices and say nothing lyrics. I just goes to show that everybody is not sopposed tobe in show business. Who does this person with a name like the great legendary Nancy Wilson get off with these unintelligable ravings.I think she shouldbe listening to some real singers out in the world and herself simply buy recording rather than make them.
2,About what you would expect.,"You can drive yourself crazy wondering why some acts become famous and why others sink into well deserved obscurity. Heart is an example of a group unoriginal to the extreme and resolutely middle brow which has become a huge selling pop juggernaut. Go figure. Sister Nancy, weary of the trappings of stardom has done an unplugged version of various favorites and originals-hair down, 'honest' and accessible. Wilson is quoted in the local paper suggesting that 'The Rain Song', written when she was twelve or thirteen, was probably the best thing whe ever wrote. And she is undoubtedly right. This is music which sounds exactly as if it were performed by someone whose entire musical ethos was in place at thirteen. Not very interesting. If you want to hear music by the more talented Wilson, get 'Traveling Miles' by Cassandra Wilson. Sophisticated, mature. The opposite of this."
3,"Pleasant, but without innovation.","This release is a pleasant, cozy listen, yet is a disappointment if you are looking for some of the innovative guitar work and arranging that the ""blonde one"" has proven capable of in the past. Vocally, Nancy has never sounded stronger and as expressive as she does in this recording. Nice job, but I would like her to push herself even more and show us what she is totally capable of. I suspect there is more."
3,OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE; SUBSTANDARD RECORDING,"I cannot think of a performer whose first solo work could be more anticipated than Nancy Wilson. Often tagged as Ann's younger sister, I always wanted to see what Nancy could accomplish on her own. There's no doubt she is a guitarist of extraordinary power and talent, so any performance should blow the roof off. And the performance on this album is amazing, as Nancy delivers more than anyone could have asked for. Except, and it's a big strike against this album, the quality of this recording is a near-disaster. One would have thought that the producers and engineers would have put together a much better production. Or, maybe they thought Nancy could rise above it? In any case, Nancy succeeds in her performance, but this one deserves a do-over."
5,An excellent primer,"1. Nice little books of radio messages. Short, simple, basic.2. Also reflects Machen's catechetical background (The glorious ""Westminster Little Catechism""). He learned it word-perfect by age 12. It shows. In this respect, Machen refelcts a more intelligent time period, when parents catechetized their children. Kudos to Machen's parents. His pedigree shaped by parental industry and love is demonstrated, methinks with little effort.3. A good brief on overall anthropological issues.4. For the seminarian, however, one needs the weightier works (although Machen could ""surely hang with the heavy-weights). As radio lectures, this was for the public.5. Worth having on the shelf after buying 25-30 of the heavy-weights."
2,Great product...lousy delivery,"I have been using this product for years...and it's great. the low rating goes to the vendor. They packaged the plastic bottles in a bubble envelope instead of a box. When I openned it, it was filed w/ liquid from my bottles! I emailed them. They sent back a dismayed email and indicated they would RESHIP IMMEDIATELY! It's been 3 weeks and another email (unanswered) and NOTHING. I'll steer clear of this vendor in the future."
5,Why is this not available on CD??,"This is an incredible collection of songs and performances by springfield, apparently, never made available in the US due to some weird contracting relationship and who would distribute in the world (phillips) and the US (atlantic). This was a long overdue correction. Why is this original double album not available, complete, on CD??"
4,In a search of a right material,"One of the best voices of 60-ies, Dusty Springfield was at the crossroads at the time when these recording had been made.She was obviously comfortable using the ballad formula but wanted to go further in soul teritory and this collection of two albums is sometimes painfuly warried.Maybe even too varried for her own good - always in a nice voice, Springfield touches simply too many styles and some of the songs (""Crombs from the table"", ""Piece of my heart"") are not really her territory.Songs by Charles Aznavour are really beautiful, as well as gentle bossa-nova material by Antonio Carlos Jobim.This is for fans only."
3,About a quarter of what I needed,"This is a pretty book. It has nice pictures of some very pretty cellars. From a practical standpoint though, only about 25% of it is actually worthwhile. They should offer a scaled down version at at quarter of the price."
4,Easy to take anywhere,"This game is great because most ages can play, as well as how well everything fits in the case. The case can be carried anywhere and everywhere. Each player or pair of players (depending on the number of players) receive a detailed intruction card on what each of the symbols mean on the dice. The directions are so simple to understand, everyone enjoys playing this game."
3,Mildly fun,"I bought this for a stocking stuffer for my son. We played it a couple of times but the kids thought it was boring and had more fun creating other games with the dice. I thought it was fun, maybe it's better for adults than kids and teens."
4,Scorpio Lovers....,"My daughter loved these earrings,and so did her older cousins(who are also Scorpio's)!! Great quality, and worth the price!!"
3,Salsa for the elevator,"The only thing elevating this one is the lineup-but just barely. There are some good moments (how could there not be with Charlie Palmieri on keyboards?), but there's not much to recommend with this late seventies release. No tracks stand out."
2,A major disappointment,"Ray Barretto got a chance to make an album for a big label in 1979 (Columbia). He had an all-star band: Charlie Palmieri (piano), Tito Puente (timbales), Steve Gadd (Drums), and many others. ""Pasttime Paradise"", a Stevie Wonder tune, is done in salsa style (Coolio would have better luck making it a rap tune called ""Gangsta's Paradise""). This is the catchiest melody on the CD. ""Cocinando"" is NOT the same song that Ray Barretto recorded on his Que Viva la Musica album, though it has the same name. Too bad, because hearing such a great band perform that classic tune was the main reason I bought this."
1,muy stinky,this is horrible. it does not even have the real themes on it. why any one would waste money on this i will never know.
4,"Better than the first, BUT...","While it is great to have these themes available, there are several flaws which keep it from being a perfect collection. As with the first CD of game show themes, several mistakes have been made regarding composers; the ""Break the Bank"" theme sounds like a 3rd rate copy of a 4th rate dub; the endings from ""Split Second"" and""Tattletales"" and the opening fanfare from ""The Price Is Right"" are all missing; the flute solo from ""The Hollywood Squares"" is also missing entirely; and ""The Gong Show"" track was lifted off a broadcast instead of using the pre-recorded version (although the liner notes do explain why a lot of game show themes aren't available anymore). But if you can get over those errors, you no doubt will like having this CD. Now, if Varese Sarabande and GSN can give us complete themes and correct composer credits on the next collection..."
5,You are a winner listening to this collection!,Thanks to GSN for packaging this collection of TV's popular game show themes in this CD! A few of these I remember growing up to including the original Match Game theme by Bert Kaempfert. There was also a version done by Billy Vaughn if I am correct. Other great themes including Password and To Tell The Truth from the 60's. This is a great compilation of some of the shows we remember from years gone by. Excellent!
5,Survey says ... GREAT CD!,"Okay, I admit it. I'm a confirmed, card-carrying game show nut. And this collection of game show themes is just the ticket when I want to relive the memories of many of the games I watched when I was growing up in the sixties and seventies -- and even on into the eighties! But there's an added bonus here, too -- themes from the '40s and '50s like the original ""The Price is Right"" with Bill Cullen and the CBS version of ""Password"" with Allen Ludden. Bottom line? Contestants, lock in this CD. It's a winner!"
5,this cd is so awesome... infact...,ive had this cd twice so far but it broke twice... this is my third time getting the cd..... hopefully doesnt break again... i find me skipping songs on cds and giving them to people when im bored with them... but not jem...this is fully of energy even when the lyrics arent cheerful...another one of my favorites is maria mena
1,one-hit wonder,"Bought this based on hearing ""Just a Ride""...that's the ONLY song on this CD any good. Rest sounds like a bad Dido ripoff without the hooks. In fact it's overproduced on much of this disc. Does absolutely nothing for me."
3,in 24 hours,"I'll be forgetting 76% of this cd, it wasn't for me.... alright lets start this review by giving credit where credit is due. ""24"" , "" missing you"" , and track 10 are absolutely brilliant songs, and almost redeem the rest of the cd, Jem is talented, Her producers suck. Most of the songs are too heavy on the beat, they cut the mic, and on some it feels like Jem is trying too hard to make the song connect, instead of just singing it. I hope Jem will seek out some better production for her next cd because she has all the tools to become a legend in music, she just doesn't have the people around her, and when you listen to the cd it is obvious."
3,Perhaps the single 'They' is a better choice,"I listened to the song 'They' many times on the radio and I liked it so much, that I bought the entire CD without checking out the rest of the songs first. I'ld better have done that, though, because it's quite disappointing. None of the songs is particularly bad, but they resemble each other too much. The first 2 or 3 songs kept my attention, but after that I didn't really listen anymore. And then I would realise that, suddenly, the CD had finished and I couldn't really remember what I had heard for the latest half an hour or so. This happened not only the first time that I played it, but also the 3 or 4 times afterwards. I'm afraid that this CD will end up catching dust."
5,Fabulous.,"All I can say is : WOW. I can be pretty picky about, well, everything, but I absolutely LOVE this CD. Every single song. I'm having trouble thinking of what genre Jem's music could be classified as: there's a taste of everything. The lyrics on many of the songs really hit home for me, and they were catchy to boot. Great things could come for her."
3,NOT BAD,"Some of it's upbeat, some of it's downbeat. Jem looks like a little kid, but she's got the smokey voice of a chanteuse. You'll probably like at least some of the cuts. It's a mixed bag but, overall, I'm glad I ran into this CD. This could be a refreshing change of pace from the usual stuff you've been listening to."
4,imagine if beth orton were on paxil/prozac/wellbutrin/lexapro/zoloft,"Don't get me wrong, I adore Beth Orton, I have all of her albums as well as her ""Pass in Time"" collection. I listen to them all, particularly the two-CD ""Pass in Time"" collection on a regular basis, which might explain why I find Jem to be such a wonderful sound.Dark, hazy, gauzy, and yet fairy beat-driven and somewhat trip-hoppy in sound, this CD is a wonderful listen from beginning to end. The marriage of the music and Jem's voice produces a very solid first solo effort. ""They"", ""Finally Woken"", ""Come On Close"", ""Save Me"", and ""Wish I"" are standouts for me. There are various influences here from electronic to reggae, yet the entire album flows and feels cohesive.Also check out Jem's song ""Amazing Life"" on the Six Feet Under ""Everything Ends"" soundtrack.I look forward to all future efforts from Jem."
4,"hip groove, nice voice","Jem's cd has mellow flowing beats. If you liked 'Everything But the Girl' or 'Olive', you will probably like this. She has a subtle sweet foggy sound in her voice that reminds me of old jazz. But then has a sweet clarity she uses also. The lyrics aren't whining and complaining about men through the whole thing, which is a relief. This cd makes me think of a modern, hip, 'Sade' groove."
4,Catchy,"More than half of songs on this album is what I call ""catchy tunes"". The whole experience is good. Though to purchase just a few songs but finished with buying the whole album."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"I heard the song ""They"" on a progressive station and thought it was great--great musically, lyrically and vocally. It sounded different than other songs and was catchy. Sadly, it is the best song on the disc.Whatever song you hear--whether it's ""They"" or ""24"" (the most likely singles), don't be fooled. The rest of the songs are mediocre at best. The lyrics on the other songs are simple and, in some cases, juvenile. Vocally, the songs show that Jem only has one singing style and that style is supposed to go with all the musical styles (hip-hop/dance, reggae, pop). It doesn't work. The vocals either don't fit or get overwhelmed by guitar or drum tracks.That's not to say that future work won't be better. I think with a better producer and maybe a more consistent style, Jem could make some very good music. This is more of an experiment.Your best bet it to find a site that sells individual songs and get ""They"" and ""24,"" which are the best tracks on the disc."
2,Dido is way better than Jem.,"I purchased this CD based on Amazon recommendations that she sounds like Dido and was disappointed. Jem does sound like Dido but her voice is no comparison or her music. I can say that I like the last 3 songs, which aren't the ones that people have heard on TV shows. Those songs like ""They"" and ""Breakdown"" are just annoying. Don't buy this CD unless you like those songs."
3,just a note,"If you're looking for the song ""Amazing Life"" by Jem that has been featured in a recent t.v. ad, see ""Six Feet Under, Vol 2: Everything Ends"". Amazon needs a better search engine..."
4,Current favorite CD,"Although this is not my usual fare, I found this CD to be very refreshing and energetic. I usually listen to Heavy Rock, Bebob Jazz or Classical music and usually music consisting mostly of samples doesn't stir me. This one does. Obviously this person has a good voice (the accent helps), as well as a good compositional style and no fear to add elements that aren't common to the 'style'.Very happy to have found a way into a new style."
3,"Good, but nothing special","After listening to the album my thoughts pretty much were ""good, not great."" Overall I enjoyed the music and I really like Jem's voice, but after a while the songs started to sound the same. Perhaps she could use a better production team. The opening track ""They"" gives the album a good start, but after a few songs the album seems to lose the vigor it started with. I agree with others that say the lyrics could be better. My personal favorites are ""They,"" ""24,"" and ""Missing You."" Although I do have some problems with the album, I still enjoy it and would not discourage anyone from buying it. I think Jem is very talented and has immense potential and hopefully her next album will be even better."
4,Jem is a jem!,"Jem's debut ""Finally Woken"" is just that... a real jem! (clever, eh?) I can't remember the last time I bought a CD and didn't feel the need to skip over any of the songs! There's no filler here. Yes, Jem is a cross between Dido and Beth Orton; and though the music isn't particularly groundbreaking, I'll be darned if it's not the catchiest, poppiest, trip-hop CD of the year. Every song on the CD is radio-friendly- which to indie music snobs can be a turn off. I can be an indie music snob myself, but this CD just hooks you right from the opening track, ""They"". It's not really cutting edge, but who cares? Get ready to hear every song on this CD on commercials and movie trailers. My only hope is that ""Finally Woken"" doesn't get overplayed- like Moby's ""Play"". Buy Jem's ""Finally Woken""- it will put you in a good mood and have you tapping your feet- and it's the soundtrack (for better or for worse) for the next two years- mark my words!"
2,Not a Jem,"Another ""chill-out,"" easy listening (though ""hip"" easy listening) artist, a la Dido, but Jem Griffiths--correction: Jem Griffiths' producers--fold hip-hop beats and soft electronica into the mix.Standout Tracks: ""24,"" ""Come on Closer,"" ""Flying High""For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"
1,Wanna be,"She's just the next ""It"" girl for the music mags for the next couple of months. I just saw her live show and it was just bubblegum dressed up. Come on, prerecorded back up vocals, whatever..She is NOT at alloriginal. She's the adult's alternative to Britney, that's about it. Prepackaged pop for the big girls and boys."
1,False Advertising,"As far as I am concerned, the song '24' is good, but the rest of this is nothing but sappy hip-hop puke that i'd rather not listen to. In other words, unless the album is a ROCK album, don't put rock music on it. It's false advertising.Also, singing off tune and/or flat is not 'haunting' in any sense of the word. Being a trained singer myself, there are times when listening to this CD that I want to rip my hair out because she sings as flat as a board."
3,And turn down that d*** drum machice,"I wonder why it was decided to mix that mecho-beat 'drum' so loud. On 'They' it really becomes too much with 'phones on. If the wanted to do a dance mix it would have been better to do a single. I guess she is trying to fall in with a Le Tigre type sound, but it sounds like Sahra Mclachlan meets Powerman 5000, clashing rather than mixing."
5,Liking the sound,"I'd never heard her before I bought this album but really like her sound. Similar to Dido but with more...pep. Her voice is strong and clear. The quality of the music is great. At any rate, I haven't taken it out of my cd player. Definitely a five star album."
4,"The sooner, the better.","I forgot how much better the earlier albums of the post-Loney Groovies (Shake Some Action, for instance) were than the later ones. I made a compilation from this using the same selections as The Groovies Greatest Grooves comp - which were the best selections all along. This one offers better sound, though, and I'm glad it's mine."
5,Excelent,"I love to read. I bought this book because of the author, and that called my attention the title ""Cien anos de Soledad"", I wanted to know what this title means and how Gabriel Garcia Marquez could write without living that long, it was amazing the way he described all the situations that make me feel that I was part of the novel.I ussually read at night and while reading this book I just wanted to go to the end and read to 4 or 5 am. I will recommend this book very hardly"
5,The best writer in the world!,"Garcia Marquez, the best writer in the world has spoken and has said it all. Macondo and the Buendia Family are the perfect metaphores if you really want to tell an undercover story about the world, the humankind and its abouts. It's totally magic. It's charming and funny. It's deep and joyfully shallow and full of life, life in a town that has survived more than one hundred years of solitude. A town that lives in our hearts because we are a part of it and it is part of us. Garcia Marquez is superb! and this is the best book I have ever read!"
3,get another edition!,"This is a great book, but this edition is full of footnotes. The problem with the footnotes is that whomever added them, thinks the reader is too stupid to understand what is written there. To any other edition (eg Editorial Diana, available here in Amazon too) I give five huge stars. Do yourself a favor and also get ""El Otoño del Patriarca"" and ""La increíble y triste Historia de la cándida Eréndira y de su abuela desalmada"".Enjoy!"
1,Horrible book,"It seems as though the author's gimmick has worked. Let's write a book in a ""circular"" time and place pattern and confuse the hell out of all the readers. Yes, we get it, the style of writing is symbolic of the cycle of life described in the book: it is a never-ending cyclic nightmare! What most annoys me about this book, however, is the literary snobbery of pseudo-literary fans who drop the name Gabriel Garcia Marquez as if he were the biggest literary genius of all time just because he wrote a book with almost no punctuation and a jumbled up storyline! Yes, life in the Caribbean is just as frustrating as this book, and no, don't live there or read this book if you don't want to drive yourself nuts."
1,I hate this book!!!!,"It's well-written and the characters are well developed, but I must say that the story is just horrible. I'm sorry, but if this is the best literature of Latin America, I'd rather not read anymore of it. I really don't know why people like this book!I'll stick to good Brazilian literature, such as Machado de Assis."
3,An over-rated Nobel laureate,"I read Spanish-language books to try to improve my Spanish vocabulary and reading ability. I had already read this author's ""Putas tristes"", and his autobiography, ""Vivir para contarla"". In the latter book García mentioned that he had read Romulo Gallegos when he was young. The latter's book, ""Dóña Bárbara"", which truly IS a classic of Latin American writing. I found García's book to have the same theme (""the struggle between landowners and peasants in L.A.), and even the style, to be essentially the same. Many other Latin authors, such as Isabel Allende, seem to also use the same plagiaristic ploy. Another thing annoying about García is his self-admitted tendency to employ outrageous exagerations with a straight face. In one episode of ""Cien años"" he describes a man so strong he carries a store counter from a store out into the street, and it too eleven men to get it back in. Come on now!!"
3,Deception,"I had a deception with this novel and this author. I thought it was first of all more organized in his thoughts, second, the theme was not one that lead to any valuable thought or of value to society, except just an invention of his imagination, which seems very convoluted. I read the one he wrote about the coronel did not have any answer or something like that, and that one I liked. But I thought this was his best novel, and I was far wrong. Gloria"
3,marvelous but at times disturbing,"Cien Anos de Soledad is undoubtedly very skillfully written. Marquez captivates his audience and the Buendias seem very real. The one detractor in my mind is the abundance of the theme of sexuality, which makes the book disturbing at times."
2,Not my kind of book,"After reading all kinds of reviews about how wonderful this book is, I had to read it. I could not get beyond the first 25 pages. Boring beyond belief. Maybe the story picks up, but I doubt it.During the 1st few pages it tells the story of this guy who buys a strong magnet from a Gypsy in an attempt to find gold with it. The magnet is so strong that it pulls the nails out of the walls of the houses and the houses collapse. See what I mean."
5,Una buena edición de un buen libro.,"Este edición, aparte de ser un buen libro, es otro edición ejemplar de Alfaguara. Sale en pasta dura y tiene un listón en medio del libro para mantener tu página. Además del libro, salen artículos de Carlos Fuentes (""Para darle nombre a América""), Mario Vargas Llosa (""Cien años de Soledad. Realidad total, novela total."") y otros. También incluye un glosario del español de Márquez (para explicar las palabras que no están o no tienen el mismo sentido en otros dialectos del español.) Y en fin, una lista de los personajes, con detalles someras sobre sus papel en la historia, pero no revela detalles.Si han leído esta historia antes o lo quieren leer por la primera vez, esta es una edición ideal que parece elegante en sus estantes después de haberlo leído."
2,Avoid Catedra edition,"This volume will fall apart as fast as you can read it. I am still in the introduction and the pages are coming loose from the crummy European glue as soon as I turn them. There are several Spanish-language editions of ""Cien Años""-- avoid this one"
1,A really irritating version of the great classic,"I ordered this book from Amazon.com because I wanted to re-read this Spanish language masterpiece. But this specific version of 100 Años de Soledad is more of a textbook, and it contains really irritating footnotes (on every page), which damage the natural rythm of the book and make reading it a disturbing experience. By all means read 100 Años de Soledad. But get a version taht contains the pure Garcia Marquez' text withou footnotes, unless you need it for a school project or something like that."
5,Supremamente ideal!!,"El mejor libro que he leido, no pude evitar que las lagrimas se me salieran cuando termine de leerlo. Deberia ser requerido en todas las salas de clase en donde se estudie la literatura latinoamericana. No solamente tiene el realismo magico que hace facinante nuestra literatura, si no que tambien posee rasgos costumbristas de nuestros paises latinos, especialmente de mi bella COLOMBIA. Garcia Marquez es un orgullo para el pueblo latino, y por ende, para mi adorado pais. No dejen de leer este maravilloso libro. Carolina Martinez, Nueva York."
1,Inexcusable scanning errors throughout text,"This is a wonderful book that I have read in book form several times. After I downloaded it in ebook form I was appalled at the frequent uncorrected scanning errors. An ""o"" frequently scans as an ""a"", an ""i"" with an accent mark as an l, etc. It's obvious that no one proofread this book after it was scanned. Amazon might tell you it's the fault of the publisher but they are still selling a defective product. This is one of the best books ever written in Spanish. Doesn't it deserve better treatment than this? Not to mention the readers. The one star is for the scanning errors, not the narrative."
4,"So far ,so good",Entre la soledad y el AmorEntre la soledad y el amor puede ocurrir :Sentimiento de Soledad y en el Amor su redencion.
5,Cien anos de Soledad Edicion conmemorativa,Este Libro de Gabriel Garcia Marques Cien anos de soledad me encanto! Tenia que leerlo para una clase en la secundaria y me alegro de ello! Tanto es asi que termine comprandolo! La version que tengo es la version conmemorativa y viene con mucha informacion adicional acerca del autor y de la historia. Vino en perfecta condicion y el diseno es muy bonito! Cualquiera que desee comprarlo creame que no se arrepentira!
5,Authentic and very readable.,It is a pleasure to have a good source for reading Hispanic literature in its original form and language. I highly recommend this version of the Garcia Marquez classic.
4,"Vale la pena, leanlo!","Es como cualquier otra lectura, varias personas te la podran recomendar,pero esta en uno abrir el libro, comenzar a leer y despues imaginarse que uno esta viendo la historia o fantasia, inclusive tome el papel que mas a uno le guste."
5,"realismo magico, magia y realidad latinoamericana","No cabe duda que en Cien años de Soledad, nuestra imaginacion se pone a jugar con el tiempo, los colores, olores, sensaciones, personajes y lugares, pero leyendo entre lineas, escudriñando entre las palabras, no solo se encuentra la magia caracteristica de la cultura latinoamericana, sino tambien su tragedia social y politica: la tirania, la dictadura, el liderazgo populista, la alienacion y perdida de lo nuestro a traves del tiempo, la soledad. Si se mantiene la mente alerta y se tiene una intensa suspicacia, Cien años de Soledad ofrece mas de lo que aparenta ofrecer. Se descubra lo que se descubra en ella, esta es una obra que una vez leida dificilmente se olvida."
5,A Latin American masterpiece.,This is one of my favorite books. I have read it twice already and will probably read it again. Every time I read this book I find new gems in the story and in the people and places that Gabo has written about here. I feel a connection to it that is almost spiritual. Maybe that's because I am Latin American also. Its like stepping into a dream.
5,Exellent!!!,"This is a very important book to read for everyone specially Latin Americans. Is the mirror of reality, is a brief of the world in a book."
5,Cien Anos de Soledad,"Gabriel Garcia Marques' best work. Romance, history, and fantasy combined. A must have."
3,It's ok,"It's ok leeter are too small uncorfortable to read, but after all i chose the book, but bigger would be better."
4,Look for the edition published by Prestel as well!,"Anyone who 'knows' Dover books, will probably agree that they offer good quality for very reasonable prices. There is nothing 'wrong' with this book, except that all the plates are in black and white, and there is no information on Haeckel and his times. Prestel has also published this book of plates, with a highly informative article on Haeckel, his influences, and those influenced by him included, AND with many of the plates 'in color' (that is, often one color in different -subtle - hues, or a color scheme based on two colors). Unless you are a strictly 'black and white' person, I would advise you to look for the Prestel book."
3,"Fun book, but better version with CD available","I recommend a different version of this book, also sold on Amazon - link below. I am not sure if it contains the same set of illustrations, but many of the illos are in color, and it includes a CD containing all the pics from the book.[...]"
3,Color edition is more fun,"The one with the color plates is calledArt Forms in Nature: The Prints of Ernst Haeckel (Monographs) (Paperback)# ISBN-10: 3791319906# ISBN-13: 978-3791319902Prestel Publishing (August 1998)The quality, in the Prestel edition, is good enough for framing if you want to take the book apart. It is printed in Germany on acid free paper, of decent weight."
3,I was dissapointed,"Though the images are stunning...I thought some would be in color. Not full color...but a monotone or duotone...not just black and white.My professor had this book, but the images were monotones and duotones. So I am dissapointed. I guess I ordered the wrong one, but I really didnt have other choices. hmm."
5,Ministry of intercession,I read this book three times. It is a hard read but it is worth understanding the concept of prayer.
3,the ministry of intercession,It seems a little cumbersome but that may have more to do with the time it was written. I'm still 'working' my way through it.
4,A NOVEL IDEA FOR A HORROR NOVEL!!,"Robert C. Sloane's novel, A NICE PLACE TO LIVE, is a very straightforward horror tale about a young couple and their son moving into a new neighborhood where something horrible and mysterious is going on. Cliched story, you might say, but that's where Mr. Sloane breathes fresh air into the premise. While I can't elaborate on the something that is slowly reducing the population of the new town, I can say that it was quite creative and novel, and back when this book first came out I really embraced the author's creativity. I will soon be revisiting the sequel, THE VENGEANCE, as well, since A NICE PLACE was as enjoyable this time out as it was back-in-the-day. Very good horror tale!"
1,hit the nail on the head!!,I totally concur with OR Murray! I would never have thought Oregon Scientific would have had something as cheap as this! It says the AC adapter is included ..it's not....why would I want a projection clock if I can't get it to project all the time? It keeps me from having to sit up in bed...look over the lump who is my dear husband and try to see the clock! It's not rocket science....but getting the clock to the correct time zone is!! Make the clock EASY! I am computer literate and my family considers me the person to do all things like this....but when companies do like this it makes that job harder! The instructions were horrible! I will definitely think again before I will spend the extra money on an OS product.
1,waste of money,"Only projects when you hit the snooze button, which is impossible to find in the dark, so what is the point? It says you can have continuous projection with an AC adapter, but try finding one. And then, I tried plugging in the AC adapter from my bedside Oregon Scientific clock, which seemed to fit but...no continuous projection still, and I can't find a manual anywhere. It's a compact and stylish travel clock if you don't need to read the time in the dark."
1,NEVER RECIEVED,"I GOT THE WRONG DISC, GOOD PEOPLE THOUGH GAVE ME A FULL REFUD AND THE DISC, SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED"
3,Don't bleep #@&* out!!!,"I've always wanted to have a little Johnny Cash on the shelf, so I went for this collection. It's got many of the standards, which is nice. BUT A TRACK OR TWO HAS BEEN EDITED TO REMOVE PROFANITY. I find this to be profane. While there may be an indication that this is the case somewhere in the item information, I missed it. Now I will have to buy (from a music store where I can listen to the tracks first and ensure they are not modified) some more Johnny Cash to get the real track. . ."
3,Not what I expected this to be,"Dont' get me wrong. I respect and admire Johnny Cash and his music, but this collection was disappointing. I guess the Folsom Prison effort spoiled me too much which features Cash at his rawest and best. Some of these songs are good, but most of it left me hanging dry. Besides, you can't just nail down a legend with just 16 songs."
1,Johnny Censored?,It's absurd that Amazon would sell a censored version of a Johnny Cash song. It's Johnny F'ing Cash! Anyone who objects to Cash can shop for childrens' music instead. Oops! Johnny has an album in that genre too!
5,Johnny Cash - 16 Biggest Hits,Wanted some vintage Johnny Cash. Enjoyed this album very much. Even my husband enjoyed this album. It met my expectations.
1,cloud played suckes,it sucked i was never able to down load it to my computer because of there cloud playeri pay for music and can not get it from them
5,johnny cash use to be real,"before he became las vegas, and tv, he was a real man -- he use to mean a lot to me, just as elvis was before they broke him in the army. so i wanted this for the memories. great price. thanks amazon"
5,16 BIGGEST HITS JOHNNY CASH,The songs are certainly sixteeen of his best and most popular. The arrangements are very good and the recordings are clear and provide pleasant listening.
5,Classics!,"I love this album. It has a lot of his famous songs like,""Ring of Fire"", ""Boy Named Sue"", and ""One Piece at a Time."" I really enjoy these songs. This is a good album for anyone who enjoys country music, especially the old time country music."
5,awesome CD,"Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash are awesome on this CD. They were such a lovely couple to watch growing up. If you have memories of their Christmas specials and following their love story, you will love this CD."
4,His best works,I liked the selections some albums don't have his best hits I will buy more of his earlier work b
3,Audio Quality Not Great,"I love Johnny Cash, and it was a treat to hear some of the songs from my childhood again...but I think his more recent recordings would have superior sound quality. This analog conversions are never as good as you would want them to be."
1,Not what I thought it was!,"I'm thinking that it was Johnny Cash's greatest hits, but it's really not. June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash's grestest hits I guess."
2,I'm Stuck . .,"I bought this for 3 songsFolsom PrisonRing Of FireI Walk The LineI know this will rub someone the wrong way, BUT the Joquien Phoenix versions are better.."
3,Cash Basics,Not the 16 greatest in my mind but you do get some of his classics. Price for album was more cost effective than buying singles.
3,Good MP3 Album!,"...But variable bit rate (VBR) download. Don't know why they can't consistantly offer 256kbps or higher files, or at least tell you the type file you're purchasing."
4,Great collection,This is a great collection of his work. I would recomend this to anybody. There are songs from several different periods of his life.
2,No laxative effect? Are you kidding me?,"I purchased these candies because a reviewer stated they had ""no laxative effect like other"" candies.I don't believe I have ever experienced a worse laxative effect from ANY candy.Yes they taste good. But after only two servings (8 pieces/ 70 calories) I experienced horrible side effects.I was not positive they were the cause so I tried them on three separate occasions and had the same results.Perhaps different people respond differently but I can certainly attest to the nasty side effects based on my own experience."
2,Not as advertised.,"The product description says apple, blue raspberry(not in the bag), cherry(not in the bag), watermelon, and grape. This is what is actually in the package apple(like 2 per a bag), grape(way to many), raspberry(again way to many and looks like grape) and watermelon(more than apple but still less than the crappier ones)."
1,Worst abdominal pain I've ever had,"The taste is excellent. You'll want to eat another.Later, you'll experience the most amazing abdominal swelling. You'll swell like Violet Beauregard in Willy Wonka. I thought I was going to explode. I heard things rattling around inside me. It was weird. It hurt a lot, too.That lasted for a couple of hours.And then I began creating my own hole in the ozone layer, unleashing a series of enormous farts that continued unabated for hours. That part was sort of entertaining."
5,Jolly Rancher Sugar Free Candy,I have purchased and used this product for over two years and would say that it has a taste that is great. Their is no artificial taste that is present in many of the sugar free candies that I have purchased.
3,jolly sugar free,"the product is good,but doesn't correct a droolibg problemwe've gone back to the regular, which does stop or alleviate drooling"
4,"Long-lasting rechargeables, great for digital cameras","Got tired with repeatedly purchasing alkaline AA batteries for our two digital cameras, and not being very satisfied with the battery life. So before embarking on an out-of-town trip (a national softball tournament) where we'd be taking hundreds upon hundreds of photos, I purchased these 2500mAh rechargeables. Got great performance from them (maybe double the amount of photos than using regular alkaline batteries?). The charger is nice & convenient, but the charge time seems kind of lengthy. But, if you plan well, it's easy enough to recharge overnight and get plenty of shots from a single charge. I'm guessing I was able to get around 500-600 shots per charge with them from my point & shoot digital. That was with a considerable amount of zooming in & out, although I rarely used the flash and the LCD screen. Use of the flash/LCD will definitely affect battery life."
1,Digital Concepts Battery Charger-WASTE of $$,"I actually bought a camera on E-Bay in December 2006 and this charger came with it. It doesn't work and the batteries won't charge. I can see how you can use for AA and AAA, but I had similar difficulty as others noted above regarding customer service. Apparently customer service has 'special' hours because they never answer the phone. When they do, you end up in a loop where a recording says you can't leave a message. Nice touch!"
2,Battery Charger Thumbs Down,"Hi, This battery charger does not charge AAA battery's and is hard to charge the enclosed AA battery's due to the load design. All battery's must be loaded from the front. The battery's themselves are somewhat OK and for what Amazon is selling this for it's ok to buy it just for the battery's and throw the charger away. Please also note that the battery's seem a bit wider then normal and you may have a problem with some devices. I guess I would have to say...stay away."
2,Minimal features and non standard battery size,No indicator to tell you when the batteries are done charging. They give you a chart and you have to figure out how many hours to keep it plugged in based on a value printed on the batteries.Batteries where slightly bigger in diameter than a standard battery. I have a cordless screw driver that is a tight fit for batteries. These batteries wouldn't fit in it at all.
1,"Batteries are okay, but the charger is dangerous",There's no automatic shutoff. The batteries can be dramatically overcharged and may well explode. They were too hot to touch when I unplugged the charger... After that the charger was thrown away.
1,Digital Concepts AA/AAA Battery Charger,"This is absolutely worthless!!! It takes forever (at least a week) to charge batteries and you have to watch so it doesn't overheat. I watch it like a hawk and leave it plugged in when I am home and unplug it when I leave for work. I've done that for about 2 weeks trying to charge the batteries and I still haven't gotten the ""green lights"". I would not waste your money. This is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" items. It is inexpensive to buy but a piece of garbage that doesn't work and you have to watch. Honestly, I wouldn't even give this a one star rating."
3,Battery Charger,Found this item to be of adequate quality for the money. One drawback. It does not shut off automatically. You will have to remind yourself to remove from the receptacle within 24 hours or the batteries and unit will become hot. Feel I got my monies worth..
4,"batteries ok,. charger works, good price",Batteries charged ok and work with no problem.I bought it for the batteries (great price forAA's) inspite of some negative review for thecharger. I did not encounter any problems withthe charger as others did.
1,not an overnight charger,"Charger may come with new house, the ad says they do not have an auto shut off thats not bad for the price but the ad also claims overnight charging but the instructions show 18 to 20 hours. Who knows where you will be in 20 hours? who would buy them if they knew it would take 20 hours as that is not over night.Perhaps over night is Alaska. i think that I will stop buying electronics online as the ads can be deceptive. This too bad because amazon is a great company."
2,cheap and scary. Used only in desperation,"This one of the scariest things I have ever plugged in an outlet in my house. There is no auto shut-off and it runs pretty hot. A charger should at least shut off when complete. Also if you look at the charge time chart it takes forever (20hrs) to charge 2500mah batteries. What about when you just need to top them off, you have no idea."
3,Good except for some cons,"Pros : very gud for charging 4 AA batteries for the price.Cons : Most of the times, the LED always shows red and never green and hence really no idea when the charging is over. Takes long time (16hrs) for charging 4 batteries"
2,"Long charging time, cells slightly too wide","The included instruction sheet lists the charging time for these 2,500mah NiMH batteries at *18-20 HOURS*. The charger doesn't even have a voltage shut-off, so it keeps ""charging"" them even after they're fully charged. So, you don't know when they're fully-charged, just wait 18-20 hours. Of course, continually overcharging NiMH cells will shorten their operational life span (unlike Li-Ion or NiCad).I also have to note that the cells are too wide. I tried to put them in my XBOX 360 controller, and they would barely even fit. I had to push so hard to get them in that the plastic coating is scratched. I've never experienced this problem with batteries before. I measured the diameter of a Duracell AA cell at 14.0mm, while the diameter of these cells is 14.3mm.Between the oversized batteries, the outrageous charging time, and a charger that doesn't indicate completion, don't buy these. They suck."
5,"On Hoffmann's ""Relativity and its Roots""","Many books attempt to expound the complexities of modern thinking in physics, but few achieve their objective as well as Hoffmann's ""Relativity and its Roots."" Hoffmann gives a superb overview of the history of thought in physics. He also gives vibrant descriptions of difficult concepts, leading the reader in the most natural way toward a solid understanding of Relativity theory and the foundations upon which it is built. In my opinion, this book ranks with the best of popular expositions both on the history of scientific thought in physics, and on modern physics itself. I recommend it for the non-initiated as well as for the seasoned scientist."
3,Some interesting history but with clarity problems,"Some interesting information from the history of science here, but this book suffers from trying to give technical explanations of scientific laws and phenomena without having the proper space to devote to those technical explanations. Also, in many places the writing is just unclear -- I've seen a lot of these things explained a lot more clearly elsewhere."
5,Excellent Reference,I received this used book 8 days after ordering in excellent condition. This is a good reference book for Ikenobo Ikebana and provides good insight into how other schools of Ikebana use Ikenobo as a basis for many of their own particular arrangements.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that the book was so thick and heavy. I intended to give it to an elderly person but couldn't due to the weight. She could never handle it.
4,They seem to like it...,"My cichlids seem to like it. The size is a bit big for the smaller ones, but when they soften up, the little fish can handle them fine."
5,From someone who knows,"This book comforts and makes you feel like you are not alone, because you are not. I have given it to other women who have lost their husbands and they have been blessed by it as well."
5,Very useful,"I found this book to be very useful to me. The author presents a positive, upbeat prespective of the oppurtunities and challenges presented by the Internet."
1,Not worth stopping for,"A biography of Catherine the Great that looks suspiciously optimistic. We glanced at it, and found juicier stuff in other works, notably Troyat's Catherine the Great. [HistoryHouse.com]"
2,A rather uninteresting tale...,"A rather uninteresting tale of an amoral alcoholic who is aimlessly searching for a right way to live. A very easy read, but lacked substance."
2,Buy it for the CD only,"There is only one reason to buy this book--for the CD. I found the book to be poorly written, bland and superficial. Of course, I had just finished reading ""Citizens of London.."" by Lynne Olsen, which is one of the best books I have ever read, period. I kept thinking to myself when I read ""World War II On the Air:..."" that it was written for middle schoolers. Honestly, I'm glad I didn't pay too much it. So, if you want to listen to the voices of radio from WWII, buy this book, but read ""The Murrow Boys"" by Olsen or ""Citizens of London"" for the history."
3,"It was okay, good but not great","I bought this as a gift for my stepdad who is interested in all things World War II, and I could tell by his reaction as he read it that it wasn't the most engrossing material he'd ever read."
5,"Tropical, cool, beautiful colors","I bought this shirt for my husband to wear to our daughters pre-k graduationwith Hawaiian theme. Three years and the shirt still looks brand new and he loves to wear it. Good quality shirt, great colors and cool to wear. Cannot go wrong with this shirt."
5,Finished it in 2 days!,"I think this was one of Luanne Rice's best books. It's definitely different from the others I've read, but in a good way.I liked that she wrote a book with some suspense. Kind of a change. She did a good job with the new aspect. She still kept in her trademarks of the East coast & beauty surrounding it as well as the love story & the family story.Great book! She's my new favorite author."
3,Liked it - Didn't Love it,"I have read all of Luanne Rice's books to date and would say that she is one of my favorite authors. I grew up in southern Rhode Island so I am familiar with many of the landmarks that she mentions. As I read, I can envision the scenarios and hear the surf pounding the shore.That being said, I wasn't as crazy about this book as I have been about her others. I don't want to give away the ending, but I thought it was just a little too far-fetched to be believable.However, I did like her development of the characters and the interaction between John and his children. That was real.I guess you can't win them all."
3,Not Crazy About This One,"I actually put this book down and read something else for a few days - I had to force myself to finish it. I have read most of her books and love her character development (everyone is so real). This one could have done without the serial killer part - too disturbing for me. I felt it was unnecessary - the story could have been told differently. Also felt that the ending was far-fetched. If she continues to write in this style, I may pass on the next book."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a Luanne Rice FAN, concentrating all of my reading efforts into working my way through her library. Beach Girls got me started and, in general, I just love her stories. The familial ties, the sisterhood, the friendships between women - all have inspired many smiles and tears.But this book was not in keeping with Luanne Rice's typical genre & left me disappointed. Graphic descriptions of violent crimes shocked me from this author.If I wanted to read that type of book, I would have chosen a different section of the bookstore.I'm reading Crazy in Love now & hoping for my faith in Luanne Rice to be restored. Because I really do love all of her other books."
5,Mingus Singing,"This is one of the few albums where you get to hear Mingus's great and gritty voice. You can hear him in the distance of _Ah Um_'s ""Better Git It In Your Soul,"" but on this album his voice is out front, most memorably on ""Oh Lord Don't Let Them Drop That Atomic Bomb On Me"" and ""Devil Woman."""
5,oh mingus oh yeah so gratefuly,"well I wish I had endless stars to rate this album,here Mingus is loud and loose to it's perfection,he has a beautiful powerful voice-wish he had made some more albums singing..."
1,OUCH!,"One of these units started shocking us on our hands when in use!We had to junk them, because that just isn't acceptable."
3,3D effects of Monster House movie,"I like the movie and the animation is already so good that you get the 3D feel. I felt like it looked more like my TV already does (having an LG 3D TV), it can change a 2D to 3D. This is what I could see, no pop out into the room which I find visually appealing if I'm buying it for 3D effects. Great movie and a good price, quality of the movie was also in great shape. 4 stars for movie, 3 for 3D effects."
5,Son loves this movie!,My son loves this Speilberg Adventure. The creepy house on the block has a story that is funny and not to scary. Not appropriate for toddlers.
4,An 8 out of 10,"I purchased this movie not really knowing the storyline but more so to add to our 3-d video collection. My wife and I are pretty much in agreeance that this movie, while not the best for the 3-d effect [compared to A Christmas Carol, RIO, or even The Nightmare Before Christmas, which was not originally filmed in 3-d but re-made to be shown in this format] is overall worth the price of admission. The storyline, although a little dark, kept us entertained from start to finish. It was worth adding to the 3-d library."
4,Fun halloween movie,"I watched this because we had two copies and I never saw it before. My 4 year old nephew was watching it one day. After watching the first half hour, I am suprised no one checked if it was alright for him or not. Within that time frame, a guy claimed to have died, a guy was drinking beer, he ripped off the head and stuffing out of a stuffed animal, and the house is just scary. I recommend this for kids age 10 and over. It should have been PG-13 I believe. Anyways I am 26 and I thought it was a cool movie. Great graphics and almost every character in it was a famous actor."
3,Spooky fun a Halloween story,"Well told story with suspense pathos ignorant cops, unaware parents, bottles of pee, and a house with an appetite. Neighbors form bonds as they try to fathom the secrets of what motivates a house to consume kites and cars.Then there is the great dialog ""That must be its uvula."" ""Oh it is a girl house.""The film is animated which allows for many scenarios that are not physiologically possible. This actually adds to the spookiness. There is a socially relevant story with a positive ending.However the there is nothing unique about the story or the characters. This makes it attractive for people that like formula films."
3,Had great potential . . .,The story line was a bit slow and I didn't care much for several of the main characters. The animation is very good. Better for ages 7 to 16.
3,Birthday Present,"I just my 5 year-old a psp and this was purchased as part of his birthday package which will 4/25 so I have not had the chance to see how this works. In the meantime, the price is great."
1,Shabby!,"I thought it was a pretty poor excuse for a 3D film, but it had some decency? But it still had something or other! Pretty Corny story though........."
3,"Exciting and Scary, but Needs Help","This movie keeps your attention but crosses the line at points. The kids loved it, but some of the parts were too scary for the younger ones. The circus fat-woman, whose spirit haunted the house, was freaky and some of the scenes were tense and frightening (such as when the woman falls to her death). There was an abundant amount of crass humor, with the boys using pop bottles to relieve themselves (though not shown, it is discussed).This is a movie that I could watch again if I was really bored, but would not choose to."
2,DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE!,"It was a total waste of 91 minutes! Two thirds of the entire movie was justthe kids screaming at the house! And it was not even close to a scary movie.The action scenes were not actiony adn they went on forever. The only person i would recomend this movie to is a 9 year old, anyone else would hate it."
2,Not Very Pleasing. From the looks of it....,"The animation just looks bad, okay! It's a step down from computer animation. It's like this movie was made in 1989 and Toy Story was made in 1995, which it was. Let's not watch it. Let's watch Cars, or maybe Open Season. That looks pretty good..."
3,Not as 3D as it could be,I think 3D should just leap at you and this does not.So for that reason I did not enjoy it as much as I expected. I hope Avatar is much better. THAT IS THE BIGGEST REASON I paid so much for this TV.Monsters VS. Aliens is by far the best 3D so far.
2,"The Movie is pretty good,",The movie is pretty good but so far streaming has been iffy. The movie goes in and out approximately 500 times!
5,Monster House on Blu-ray 3D Version,I rate this product great because I like the description of this item. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for this particular 3-D item.
3,3D Just Okay,I own only 2 3D movies since there is not much 3D content out there right now but in comparing this with the other movie I own (Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs) it is sub-par to say the least. The 3D seems to work in some areas but not in others. There are times when you will be amazed at the effect and other times where you will be wondering if your 3D is even working (this was not the case with the other movie I own). This movie on its own is a tad dull as well and I only bought it for the 3D effect.Overall: Buy it if you really liked the movie but don't expect to be dazzled by the 3D.
3,Better 3D effect for my 1st 3d movie at home,"If you want to get a 3D movie without thinking about story, kid's choice, etc... just get it.lively to watch the move in 3D, excellent audio quality.But trust me, kids won't like this movie at all. nothing great for them except some visual effects."
5,Really enjoyed it,"Funny and kind of scary. I jumped a few times, but my grandkids didn't even flinch."
5,My favorite Blu-ray movie,"When I have friends over and I want them to experience Blu-ray for the first time, this is usually the movie I grab. The story has universal appeal, it's kid friendly, and the picture is beautifal.Out of my entire collection, this is the movie I've seen the most and is , in my opinion one of the best examples of quality in sound and image out there."
5,Monster House (Blu-Ray): Review,"Lets be honest here, the movie isnt the only reason for getting this product, its the picture quality and clarity, as well. And Blu-Ray does just that. With a resolution of 1920x1080p the image/picture quality is crisp and great. The details are vivid and well done, of course many of the smaller audiences who do watch it dont really care for the picture quality and all that other technical stuff but older people who know their tv stuff will surely see the beauty and respect this movie deserves.As for the moive, its no Shrek or Pixar, but it does have its moments and the facial expressions throughout the movie are by far the best in any other big computer-generated (CG) Animanted film. However, it does have a ""horror"" movie feel to it and may be a little too much for some children, but all in all its a decent movie and a decent movie to have on Blu-Ray.I watched the movie on my 40"" Samsung 1080p LCD HDTV"
5,Monster House DVD,This DVD was in excellent condition and it arrived in a timely manner. I would definitely buy from this seller again. The movie was clear and I encountered absolutely no problems. Thanks again.
3,3D Effect,"Watched Monster House 3D with my daughter last night, 3D wasn't that great, especially if you compared it with Monster vs Aliens."
2,Pretty but dumb.,Looked great.Story was horrible. Had a lot of potential. Would have loved to have seen kids trick or treating. I wouldn't even rent this. Just so you know.
2,"Great movie, not as impressed in bluray 3d as anticipated","Great movie, not as impressed in bluray 3d as anticipated. The cg is not as good as I remembered, def not as visually impressive. Still a decent buy just not in 3d."
4,Scary Animated Movie for Kids and Kids at Heart,"This movie is about a haunted house which kidnaps trespassers and steals toys which end up in the yard. One day, the neighbor boy across the street and his friend (the loveable, portly Chowder) decide that they are going to do something about this Monster House (after all, the responsible grownups and police officers know nothing of this).Along the way, a neighborhood girl gets involved, and the story picks up in intensity. There are some truly humorous moments of dialogue, and toward the end of the film, you discover the mystery and the secret behind this Monster House.The movie was mildly entertaining, and most kids will like it without getting overly frightened.I should also say that the animation in this movie was absolutely stunning. The way things are going, you wonder if there will be a need for more actors and actresses in the future, because the animation is getting more and more realistic."
2,Not for Children,"I just finished breaking this DVD in half and throwing it away. How it every got a PG rating I'll never know. I'm afraid this rating will lull parents into thinking this movie is safe for kids. It isn't. Despite being a ""cartoon"" it is mean, very violent and frightening right from the beginning with crude bathroom humor scattered throughout. The movie starts with a kid thinking he has killed the old man across the street and went down hill from there. Not for kids and as far as I'm concerned. I didn't even want it around the house."
3,it was cool,"while this film was very predictable&I've seen far more scary films over the years, this film was done really well. the direction&creativity was very good.that House was real Creepy no doubt. I've seen some cribs like that in real life&I've hauled Booty real Quickly. if a House looks like Casper might be partying in there, then I'm gone ASAP. the voices were good,but the film had some parts that were hit&miss. it's cool to peep out during Halloween."
4,Surprisingly solid horror/family movie,"The previews for Monster House are a bit misleading. It seems like a childish animation film using gimmicks like a Jon Heder cameo to sell tickets. In reality, this movie is so much more than advertised.After a flood of disappointing animation films in recent history Monster House is a pleasant surprise. All the characters are well developed and fun to watch including Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard appearing briefly as the main character's parents.Monster House calls back memories of great ""kids"" movies from the 80's: Goonies, Lost Boys, Stand By Me, to name a few. The house is actually pretty scary (maybe too scary for small kids) and the story moves along pretty nicely. This is the kind of movie that is enjoyable for all ages."
5,My granddaughter loves this,My granddaughter is three years old. They were over for Thanksgiving day and she watched this movie so many times I lost count. I loaded it on my Kindell for her and her mom will get her the DVD for Christmas.
4,Really fun but not for little people.,"Monster House is clever, scary and poignant. But not for the little ones: it was a bit much for my 3 year old grandson!"
4,"Decent annimated scary movie, good 3D effects",The 3D effects were good and the movie was interesting enough to hold this adult's attention. Its a bit spooky for little kids and the theme is a bit depressing. Those with high religious standards (or even medium ones) may not like it but I found it entertaining and there's not a lot of 3D movies out there now so it was a decent choice.
2,Kind of lame,"Has occassional moments of interest, like the opening sequence (little girl riding her tricycle through the leaves), but mostly the movie engendered a ho-hum feeling. Same can be said for the 3D effects-I kept checking my glasses to see if they were on."
1,Not for young kids,"I was very disappointed in this movie. There were a few inappropriate scenes for kids 8 or under; a scene with a teenage babysitter having her boyfriend over, drinking beer and asking for a little you-know-what was not what I expected to see in an animated movie geared towards kids. The story was a little freakish. Not a movie I would watch again. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,Dated graphics. Scared my 6 and 8 year old,Graphics are really dated. Its a 3D break through for animated films for sure. Creepy neighbor was so scary my kids made me turn it off.
2,slow service,Item was received damaged. I returned it for a refund. One month later I am still waiting for the refund.
4,"interesting, i liked it, fun to read, you should read it!","This book is about a girl named Megan, who's about 13 years old, having to bounce back from a motorcycle accident she has a lot of problems along the way. One involves her having to learn every thing over again because she is in a wheelchair, and paralyzed from the waste down. Another is that she hasn't heard from the boy who was driving the motorcycle when they crashed."
5,MUST-HAVE SET!,"My three-year-old daughter LOVES her Loving Family dollhouse and plays with it for hours. We have many of the dolls, and each one is a different member of our extended family. As we do not live by our families, it's a great way to foster a love and remembrance of aunts, uncles, and cousins she may only see a handful of times a year. I consider this set a MUST-HAVE set because it includes a BOY. We have lots of little girls, but the boys are very hard to find, as not many types of Loving Family boy dolls have ever been made. The entire Loving Family line is durable and brimming with details. All of my daughter's friends love her dollhouse, too--even the boys!"
1,Total Waste,"This is one of the worse movies I have seen in a long time. While the concept is good, the acting is very poor, no research was done since the costumes were way off as was the dates used. In the beginning the date was shown as June 3,1943 then June 4th and yet the following scenes depicted Pearl Harbor as just being bombed. The actual WWII footage was the same and used over and over. It bounced all over with no flow."
5,just one tiny flaw....,"Apparently these aren't being made any longer!! Excellent product, great cinnamon taste, just the right size candy and container."
5,Rap songs,I bought this as a gift for my sister she lost her big 45's so I surprised her with this cd it has a lot of the songs she likes it has quite a few I like too I'm a rocker but worked in night clubs and a lot of these songs grew on me
2,Another attempt to repackage The Sugar Hill Gang,This cd should simply be titled best off the Sugarhill Gang. With only one new track its a waste of time to even buy it. Although if you don't have any off their old cds it could be worth the hastle.
5,he's da masta,the best eva nothin' beats da hip hop records like dis man does. the variety and new selection from '99 is great.not enought good things to say very TIGHT CD.
2,Misleading,"Misalliance is a great play, four stars for Mr. Shaw. But I can only give two stars to the product as it is a print-on-demand version of a publicly available text. If that's what you're looking for, and are comfortable paying 10 bucks for it, this is perfect for you. I personally felt mislead, and would not have made the purchase if the product description had been forthright with this information (which is, I suppose, exactly why it wasn't)."
2,From the music programmer's side,"This is a nice sanitized set of top 40 songs and disco songs that made the top 40 and disco songs that never really did much.I rate this CD according to my tastes, I'm sure it will please many.People wonder why songs aren't on this set. That has a few reasons, some are:1 - Not available to license for compiliations (some artists NEVER appear on comps for many reasons)2 - The artists with the big big hits may want to much for the licensing of their track (either royalty or advance)3 - The programmer's of the disc know only what they've been told and didn't live the era.What I'm a fan of is the hardcore lost stuff. I played it then in the clubs and it lit up floors. Many people may remember them if they hit the clubs back then but the songs only were in the mixes or on DISCO stations, not the played out top 40 stuffExamples: John Davis, Liquid Gold, Le Pamplemousse, France Joli, CJ & Company and others. This is nice but not deep."
3,Basic disco.,"A fine, if limited collection of most of the disco hits that made the Top 40 in the 70's and early 80's. Tracks are presented in their single mixes, which is a weakness since much of disco's hypnotic appeal laid in the extended versions heard in the clubs. The liner notes mention quite a few rare disco tracks, which would have been more welcome inclusions in this set than the 80's post-disco selections on disc 4. Overall a good summation of mainstream disco, though hardly a goldmine for hardcore fans."
1,"THIS MAKES ME WANT TO SLEEP, NOT DANCE!","What the world didn't need was a 4-CD box set of the same, tired disco we hear on every K-tel compilation CD, and in this box set, they got it. This is radio disco, not club disco. There are no surprises, no lost or extended mixes, nothing we might have heard in the New York clubs in the 70s or early 80s. Where are Freddie Mercury, Dennis Parker, France Joli, or Bonnie Pointer? How many more times do we have to hear Y.M.C.A.? Rhino really missed the dance boat. Shame on them."
5,Great read for anyone who loves fantasy and frogs!,"Hidden beneath the adventures of Freemont are eternal spiritual truths that can uplift any reader. Wounded and angry, Freemont struggles with the same problems we all struggle with and slowly becomes more open and compassionate toward life and the others he meets in his travels. He's on his way to discovering the environmental dangers that face all frogs, their causes, and very possibly, sometime in the future, their solutions. Great for children, youth, and adults who are young at heart."
5,A Must for Parents Dealing with Sibling Rivalry,"""What About Me?"" is an excellent book for children. It teaches them important life skills that are so crucial and the illustrations are simply beautiful. This book is a wonderful way to address sibling rivalry - Great for the entire family.Mom Writer's Talk Radio www.momwriterstalkradio.com"
2,ok,"Really did not have an impact on my son. The books that have really stirred them up are: ""His Mighty Warrior"" and ""His Little Princess"" by Sheri Rose Shepherd. I read them one page a night. They look forward to the readings and positively beam as I am reading to them.His Mighty Warrior: A Treasure Map from Your King"
4,Identical (?) to ASIN B0000206A6,"Hodges & Davis were great, and I wish more of their stuff were readily available. But this one appears to be a duplicate of ""Johnny Hodges & Wild Bill Davis"". It has the same two artists and the same track list as ASIN B0000206A6. (Damn. And there were so few albums of these guys as it was!) That other album at least has some audio samples."
5,An Informative Book,This book is very informative. It is a great way to find information about Albert Einstein. I wrote a wonderful report using the information in this book. It explains his theorys of relativity in a simple understandable way.

2,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! THIS IS BAD!,"Elfman's foray into film scoring territory mastered by Thomas Newman, the subtle minimalist side, is a disappointment. Instead of bringing anything fresh to it, he creates a BORING main theme which he plays with incessantly. The only thing that buoys this record is ""Tracks In The Snow"", in which Elfman recovers, and crazily throws percussion around to weave a suspenseful and raucous action cue. (GOOD) But the rest? (BAD)"
1,disappointed,"as a longtime fan of danny elfman, i've listened to almost all of his work, bought almost all of his CDs, and loved his music for years. unfortunately, elfman has disappointed me, for the 1st, and hopefully, the last time. A SIMPLE PLAN has good intentions as a score, it even has a couple good cues, but the entire score is boring, without that quirky bold flavor that elfman made his with scores to EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BATMAN RETURNS and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!I realize elfman is trying to expand his musical horizons and experiment, but this score, as a listening experience, is a DUD."
4,I thought that was really cool.,"This is the last album by the late Lee Hazlewood. It is a very eclectic album, with lots of different types of songs. Lee's voice was not at full strength at this point, but it doesn't matter; his weathered voice is totally appropriate for this album. There are five guest vocalists helping out on the album, including Lee's very young granddaughter. The songs highlight Lee brilliant production skills, as well as his eccentricities. Lee's own records were never as commercial as the ones he produced for Nancy Sinatra, but they are very charming in their own way. This is the perfect final album for an often under appreciated artist."
4,J. Millar is Right,"I was going to write a review for 'Cake or Death', but it seems J. Millar in New York has already expressed my exact opinion regarding this record. Do away with ""She's Gonna Break Some Heart Tonight"", ""White People Thing"" and ""Some Velvet Morning"", and you've got a damn fine way to end an incredible music career."
3,Good Details,"I read a lot, I'm reviewing this book not as an expert but as a reader. The story is OK, it has some good thoughts, but in my opinion it's not Very good or Excellent, so I give my opinionated rating of 3 stars. Doesn't mean the book isn't great, just that, to me, it doesn't compare to very good or excellent, 5 star stories/novels. Sufficiently philosophic, and good detail of WW2 American airborne."
3,ok,"Ok, but not great. Had more fun with adiemus. The songs were not original, but I enjoyed the first song and evening falls, which is a remake of enya."
3,Are you sure you don't already have it under another title?,"It's the same book as Stick Making, a Complete Course-- except in compact format! So don't make the mistake I did and order both books. ...Other than that, it's a great little book. So if you don't have the other one, by all means order it; you won't be disappointed!"
1,Better off with a pad of paper,"Before I bought this book, I was using a normal notebook to keep track of my workouts. That was far better than this book. Save about eight bucks and buy a Mead!"
1,SIIG USB 2.0 9 IN 1BAY READER-WRITER ( JU-91NF12,I cant believe that Amazon requested a review from me on this product.They sent the wrong model (no floppy drive)to me twice and then said they didn't have the right one.If you order from them you should check out what you recieve very carefully.The 1 star rateing is for Amazon not for SIIG !
3,Solid Swamp-Rock,"If you like blues/rock with a ""swampy"" feel, this is a tough one to beat. Omar & the Howlers do this stuff better than almost anyone out there. I think this CD's a little less blues-oriented and a little more rock-oriented than some of his previous stuff. Still think Omar's voice is one of the most unique out there. If you have a chance to see them in person, do it. Great show!"
5,"A very old classic starring Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon and David Niven. It demonstrates passion, hatred and revenge.",An excellent movie with very good acting. It is a story of 2 people who fall in love but are unable to marry because Merle is already married. Her character Cathy gets sick and dies unable to spend her life with her true love Heathcliff.
5,The Perfect Heathcliff and a Haunting Cathy! Wow!,"Laurence Olivier is amazing as the lovestruck barn boy whose relationship with Merle Oberon causes infatuation and self-destruction! Even thought it is not a perfect adaptation of Emily Bronte's classic, the actors capture the characters entirely! The ORIGINAL Issue (HBO/SAMUEL GOLDWYN) is a MUST! Special Features include Cast Bios / Original Theatrical Trailer / and a fairly modern interview with an unrecognizable Geraldine Fitzgerald who played the part of Heathcliff's wife and Cathy's sister in law. Reading of the affair between actors Olivier and Vivien Leigh (Famous for Screen characters like Scarlett O'hara/Blanche Dubois), one must wonder how Leigh might have handled the role had she accepted it rather than GWTW. Want another {sigh sigh}romantic classic - try ""That Hamilton Woman!"""
3,Not sure...,"This film almost left me dumbfounded. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.The Heather on the supposed Yorkshire moor(actually filmed in, Ventura County, California) is massive and much to big.Merle Oberon is pathetic in this role and how she got the part i'll always wonder (perhaps being engaged to influential director Alexander Korda just might of helped the situation).Laurence Olivier is the best thing in this film his performance is perhaps his best film effort around this time.LO fans should definately watch it."
3,Wuthering Heights,"The next time I buy anything from the internet, I will read the product information a little more carefully. The movie I purchased, ""Wuthering Heights"" was made for Region 2. I'm not sure I know what that means, but apparently my DVD player does not accommodate movies made for Region 2. I can't return the film because the product description clearly states (on a second look)that this video can only be seen on Region 2 DVD players."
5,"A classic film, despite straying from the book","Once again, this is a film that tries to squish an entire novel in a limited time frame. I really hate that, because it means that characters are left out, scenes are deleted and (in this case) entire chapters are forgotten. Still, though, once more, this film manages to capture the heart of the book, which is the lifelong tortured romance of Heathcliff and Cathy. Cathy loves poor stable boy Heathcliff, but she vainly marries another for his wealth and position. This sets Heathcliff off on one of the most obsessive revenges ever captured on film. Olivier does a master performance as Heathcliff, a tortured soul embittered by the loss of love. Merle Oberon as Cathy is good too. She has equal parts wildness and viciousness. You really want to hate her, but you sympathize with her at the same time. This film is a rollercoaster of emotion, just like the book, so despite its deletion of other parts, it still is a fascinating watch."
2,"Movie Great, seller poor","The movie was great, but the seller sent a copy that does not play well. Skips, and freezes. Very unhappy with this seller. Would like to know how they are going to resolve the problems with the DVD.Like MoviesKerrville TX"
1,"Not worth the read, even for free","I tried, I tried really, really hard to get into this story; I just couldn't do it! Couldn't get around the olde English way of speaking or the story. Just not my ""cup of tea""."
5,The Best Version,"A large part of the novel by Emily Bronte is left out of the movie and the plot is simplified. It is still considered a classic film mostly because of the high quality of the acting. There are superb performances by Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon. A strong supporting cast includes David Niven, Flora Robson, Donald Crisp, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Leo G. Carrol, Cecil Kellaway, Miles Mander and Hugh Williams.The cinematography by Gregg Toland was in the same category of excellence as the acting. Although the story was also made into a movie in 1920, 1953 and again in 1970, it was the 1939 version alone which excelled."
1,UnCertified/Bootleg DVD - $59.99! Unbelievable!,"Check out the Internet Movie Data Base under Certified Korean Titles. This title is NOT listed in the 1939 version. It's an UnAuthorized/UnCertified Release. AKA: Bootleg/Pirated copy from Korea. And Seller is charging almost $60.00 for it.Worst part of all, Amazon allows this stuff to go on.It makes one wonder just how reputable Amazon is.Paradine"
4,Love Denied,"This film is based on the Emily Bronte novel, but it is not the word-for-word adaption as seen with some modern Shakespeare movies. This movie focuses on the denied love between Heathcliff and Cathy. The revenge is there in force, but that is not the main idea here.If you watch this film as a substitute for reading the book, I would note that not all the characters from the book are present and the use of the homes as metaphor is not emphasized here. In this movie, there are no offspring. The movie flashbacks end with the death of Cathy.Although the movie won an Oscar for cinematography, I found the work of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon to be top notch. Comparing the book with their work, I believe that they are Heathcliff and Cathy. I would watch this just for their performances.I would recommend seeing this movie."
1,not what i wanted,the movie was not what i wanted because it did not play in any america dvd. i could not watch it.
1,Carful Ordering you turn on the DVD and you'l see Japanese sub titles,I ordered this for my Grandmother and The DVD locks great put the problem is win you stick in it automatically go to Japanese subtitle and you have to take them of every time you pop it in and it is in speaking English. Win I got the DVD I thought they rip me off because they don't tell you about it.Written By: Josef Holzer
2,Laurence Olivier,"Great movie, but sad. I like movies with happy endings. My favorite Laurence Olivier movie so far is Pride and Prejudice."
5,Classic film. To get a new copy you have to buy a Korean import.,"Such is the pathetic state of affairs of U.S. cultural values. That there is no American distribution of this great film is a crime. As in many cases, Americans have to rely on foreigners to keep many aspects of our traditional culture viable."
3,Give That Orchestra a Break!,"I really wanted to like this movie. I am a hopeless romantic at heart, surrounded by cynical naysayers as most of us are. I do believe that love is the greatest of things - but alas, I cannot recommend this movie. The dialogue is stilted and doesn't ring true, although the performances are, for the most part, excellent, given the cheese that the performers had to wade through. The biggest flaw and sign of dating, however, is the never-ending, overdramatic orchestration in the background - after a while, I longed for the awful scene in the Fountainhead with the incessant jackhammering - at least, it would have matched what this orchestra was doing to my head. My housemate and best friend called this a chick flick for the '30s; well, I never cared for most chick flicks, then or now (if you are in that frame of mind, I recommend the far, far superior Terms of Endearment)."
1,Worst Movie Ever.,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! It was supposed to be based on Emily Bronte's novel, but I don't think that the director even read the book! It was truly dissapointing to see this movie. They set it in the wrong time period, wrong clothes, and even cut out the last half of the book. Heathcliff, who is evil, is portrayed as good, and Edgar, who is good, is portrayed as evil! Even though the movie is bad, the novel ""Wuthering Heights"" was one of the best books I have read. I suggest that you buy the book, and not this movie."
1,Haven't received yet!,"I am still waiting for this! I am hoping to get it before Christmas. I'm sure once I get it, it will be awesome."
5,Pure movie magic,"Does it really matter that this was released in 1939? What about the cheap production values, weak set construction, dated acting, primitive cinematography and low-budget sound editing? No, the fact is that it still can't be done better today. Olivier, Oberon, Niven and Wyler made a movie masterpiece that stands up remarkably well today despite numerous TV broadcasts and big budget remakes. The original is still the best. Watch for yourself. Within just a few minutes you won't be able to stop."
3,Wuthering Heights (Import All Regions),"It would have been nice if the listing on Amazon would have mentioned that there is a foreign language subtitle across the bottom of the screen while the DVD is playing. Although the movie is in English, the subtitles are a little annoying. You do get used to it after awhile, but it would have been nice to know what I was purchasing."
4,A Classic,"This is a must for old film buffs. Though the passing years have rendered it a bit melodramatic for modern tastes, the performances still crackle with electricity, with a very young David Niven turning in a spot on version of Linton."
4,Wuthering Heights,You can't go wrong with Merle Oberon and Olivier. A tempestuous love story that does not end well or maybe it does. Catherine and Heathcliff are cast as the tragic lovers. I will never forget the speech Olivier delivered after his Catherine (Merle Oberon) died. I wept until my eyes were red and swollen.That speech exemplified the romance/obsession every woman wants. I recommend the movie whether you are a hopeless romantic or not.
2,Beware!,This movie is great and a classic! But the language on the DVD box is in Korean and is set-up with subtitles in Korean!!! The seller suggested to just turn off subtitles! I have an older DVD player and this is a lot easier said than done. I wanted an all English version. Very disappointed in this purchase. Will be very wary of products coming from this seller!
1,Wuthering Heights,Looked like a pirated copy. Looked like it was taped off TC then transferred to a a DVD. I returned it.
3,Not like the Book,"I wanted to watch this after I read Wuthering Heights and was a little disappointed it only covered pretty much the first half of the book. I won't ruin what happens, but it skips over an entire chunk of their lives. I thought Lauren Olivier was great though. I am going to watch the BBC mini-series next which I heard was a lot better with being true to the book and including all the charaters."
1,What?!,I don't even remember buying this movie. How did it end up on my list when I wouldn't see such a boring movie. I don't care if it's a classic. I didn't order this. I wonder who did!!!
5,Ultimate Love Story,This is the perfect movie for people who love old romantic movies.An absolute classic.
4,Classic Movie!,"My wife's favorite movie, ""HeathCliff, Oh Heathcliff!""Played well on the DVD Player. No Problems."
1,dissatisfied!,"I realize I purchased this classic movie last year, but I am just seeing the review area for it. I must have misunderstood this movie wasn't in English! What a waste for such a classic favorite of mine :-("
1,Cannot watch it,"I cannot review this product, because I cannot watch it. It was not for my region. Very angry. This is not the first time this has happened to me. Guess I will have to buy my movies else where"
1,"NEVER RECEIVED, UNRESPONSIVE /RIPOFF SELLER","THIS ITEM WAS NEVER RECEIVED. I CONTACTED SELLER, BUT GOT ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE.MY RATING OF THIS SELLER IS LESS THAN ZERO."
5,STILL THE BEST VERSION,"At last count, I believe there are about 11 versions of this classic story on film. None can compare to the original 1939 version.Who can forget Alfred Newman's Oscar nominated score."
4,what else can be said of a classic,"except - Cathy, get your head out of your ear. Good grief woman, grow up and give the guy a break. A lovely old classic and worth watching, over and over."
3,Great movie....funky disk.,"My three star review is for technical reasons, as the film itself is a classic. My disk came with Asian (Chinese?) text that I can't get rid of no matter what buttons I push on the flat screen TV or the disk player itself. I can look past it, but it is annoying and I which I could make it go away."
2,Why'd they skip so much of the book?,"Wuthering Heights, as a movie, was very good. Unless, you happened to read the novel. Then, don't even bother to watch the movie. They omit, in my mind, some of the best scenes from the novel. Where are all the children characters like Cathy, Heathcliff, and Hindley had? They played very important roles in the novel. They did an excellent job of remaking the first half of the novel, then they jumped to the end and completely skipped the second half. If you like romantic movies, but prefer not to read the novels, then you will love this movie. However, if you prefer to read the good ol' classics, like myself, don't waste your time on this remake: you will be very disappointed."
2,Just not my cup of tea. Some say this is a classic.,"But what do I know? I do know old movies. This one feels old. Of course it was made in that greatest of all movie making years, 1939. GWTW, Oz, Young Mr. Lincoln, Dark Victory etc. etc. It's an overwrought mellow drama that really doesn't do the book any favors. How could it? Great acting doesn't make a great movie. Olivier, Fitzgerald, Oberon. Pretty good cast. I always like David Niven. He's the fussy Edgar, too stupid to know that he should not marry Oberon's Debbie. Olivier's Heathcliff turns into a real bastard. There's really no one to care for.several of the cast die. So what? See it if you must, for the acting. I did & nearly fell asleep."
1,Paid but never received,I can't review this product when it has never been received. Thirty-two days have elapsed since the order was confirmed and Amazon has failed to follow through with their portion of the purchase agreement. Regardless if I receive my payment back I will never purchase through this organization ever again.
1,Beware PAL format,I overlooked that this is some region 2 BS. They shouldn't be allowed to sell this crap inside the US unless it's a special order. Guess I'll let my dog play frisbee with it.
5,Thank you SoKorea,"I was hesitant to buy this South Korea import. Glad I did. It's an excellant quality DVD. If anyone has trouble with subtitles or language, take a second look, the options are there. The 'none' option is pretty much hidden in the background. So once I found it, smooth sailing to one of my favorite movies. 5 stars for both the movie and the quality of the DVD."
5,Works flawlessly!,"I bought these based on the same product's reviews on newegg, and they worked great for me! I saw another amazon review that said they didn't stick in place well, and I'm sorry to hear they didn't work for them. I have been building computers for many years now and these are just as good as any cables you can spend a lot more for. They have metal clasps on the sata cables that hold the connections in place, and the connection's so secure I can pick up a 3.5in drive just by the cable. The power adapter cable is useful as well, and essential for many computers. Used it to add a backup drive in a server and it's been working flawlessly this whole time."
4,Works nicely,"These cables do exactly what you would expect them to do. Connections are fine, the locking mechanism is firm and secure. They fit perfectly with my barebone SSD. The price of these cable makes it a good purchase."
4,Near-Essential Mingus,"First, the good news: This album starts with one of Mingus' greatest longer songs, the propulsive Haitian Fight Song, appropriately rousing with a characteristically long, brilliant bass solo. Blue Cee is good, but a bit too long - the lovely Reincarnation of a Lovebird is more like it, his best ballad with the exception of Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.Enter the title track.The Clown itself is a spoken-word piece narrated by Jean Shepherd. And while his A Christmas Story is one of the funniest movies ever made, this is a complete failiure. It's not just that I don't find the story all that great - though I don't - the performances aren't all that interesting eitehr, so if you don't like the narration, too bad. I appreciate Mingus' avant-garde nature, but I'd rather hear that on A Foggy Day (In San Francisco) or Bird Calls."
4,Fine Mingus fare,"Though I think the ""II B.S."" version of ""Haitian Fight Song"" is more fun, the latter, which is on this disc, has more of Mingus playing solo bass. ""The Clown"" is one of the artist's crowning achievements, about a clown who is only appreciated when he is depressed and suicidal; the song is actually, according to the liner notes, about the way Mingus saw jazz artists like himself: no one ever cared much until they were gone. The added tracks are good, as well. I rate ""The Clown"" as Mingus' second best, after ""MingusMingusMingusMingusMingus."""
4,Good part quick delivery excellent value,The Catalytic converter fits correctly and without issue. Overall the unit Is well made with thick plate steel foir the flanges and heavy gauge tubular piping. There are no mounting points for the OEM heat sheild but the sheilding supplied appears to be adequate.I would not use it for a performance rig because the inlet appears to be less than 50% area found in the OEM cast iron unit. It's basically an oval hole in a round metal plate whereas the OEM unit is more of a very large diameter funnel leading down to the outlet port. I'm not sure if the resulting turbulence and restriction has any significant impact on mileage or performnce.The packaging left a lot to be desired since the unit was loose in the oversize box without any packaging material whatsoever.Overall an excellent value for the money at 116.00 USD.
2,disappointing,my daughter loves the teddy bear song but this book was boring and did not keep her attention. the illiustration are just ok.find a better one!
5,My Favorite Gum,"This is my favorite gum, has great long lasting flavor and gum is soft and easy to chew."
3,Rack Bag review,"While this bag is nicely made, it only fits the specific rack from topeak, there is no option to use on standard rack."
5,RX Trunk Bag EX,"A well made product, small and compact but useful to store lock, extra inner tube and a few bike repair items. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a little extra carrying space for around town trips. Cheers"
2,Too Small & Heavy For Me,"This bag is high quality and had nice features. However, I was looking for a medium capacity trunk bag that was smaller than the typical bags available, and this looked perfect. Once it arrived I unfortunately discovered that the foam insulated walls take up a lot of space, leaving an interior barely larger than a large seat post bag. In addition, the bag is heavier than typical because of the thick plastic connector on the bottom that locks it to the rack. The combo weight of the bag plus rack is almost 3 pounds more than a comparable seat post bag.I returned the bag and rack, and bought a ""Detours - Hightail ULP"" bag. It weighs 1 pound less than the Topeak bag/rack combo, and has the medium capacity I was looking for. I love it. I bought it at eBags for less than the Amazon price, but it was supposedly on sale."
5,"Good for price, a little small but does job","It does exactly what I expected it to:-Fit securely on the back of my bike-Hold basic tools (for on the road maintenance), bike pump, keys, phone, money clip, Nalgene bottle, and the brief owners maintenance manual.-Doesn't get squished with the bungie chords I use to keep it firmly attached.It's a little small, so don't expect to carry too much. The stuff I listed above are small (except for nalgene, which fits snugly into the main compartment) and basic (i.e. key chain is only car key + house key. Maintenance tools are 2 small screw drivers and a couple of other small ""made for this bike only"" tools)."
2,Laughably small,"I believe that this is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. Looking at a few of the more positive reviews, I can only imagine that those who mention packing clothing or shoes in this bag must be super-petite. I couldn't get a decent-sized lunch in this bag, let alone any clothing-okay, maybe a case for my glasses. I've had middling-sized handlebar bags that were more useful. The MTX bag is bigger, but still hardly worth it. Skip this item."
4,Book,"Was a requested present. When read in sequence, this book was a delight. I was so happy to find it and give it to my Mom."
5,Fabulous!,"I bought this for my kids but ended up listening to it over and over. Ted Jacob's is an amazing musician who surrounds himself with equally talented people. Great melodies beautifully arranged. This is a unique, totally original collection."
5,Beautiful cd,"I have been listening to this beautiful CD for 10 years and continue to love it. I grew up with these poems and have so enjoyed listening to them set to music on this CD and look forward to sharing these songs with my grandchildren. I highly recommend this not only for children and grandchildren but for delighting the ""inner child"" of anyone who grew up hearing these poems!"
5,Delightful CD for Whole Family,"My year old triplets received this CD as a birthday gift. I didn't play it right away because I thought it was another classical music cd of which we have several...I was so pleasantly surprised by this CD. My babies just love it, dancing and clapping to the songs. We play it all the time and are not tired of it yet. In fact I am here today buying a copy as a baby gift."
1,Guinea pig hates it,"My guinea pig really doesn't like this stuff, and he won't eat it as much as the regular, plain pellets that I bought for him in the past. I've heard comments before that Kaytee isn't that good of a brand, but I was desperate when I bought this because I couldn't get to a store to buy his usual brand. Plus, after I started feeding this to my guinea pig, he got sick. I'm not sure if this was the cause, but when I stopped and started feeding him something else he recovered very quickly. Felt like a waste of money, I won't be buying this again.It made him poop a lot more than normal though, which isn't exactly a plus."
2,Not recommend,My GP does not like this and he poops a lot after eat this.Does not seem to be good for the GP.
3,guinea pig food by kaytee,"this is a good price for a 25lb.bag,it's so hard to find that size at a reasonible price and the quality for the price isn't bad either.when you have multible guinea pigs this is needed for cost affectiveness. i plan on buying it again if the price stays good."
3,Just Ok,The CD was shipped fast and the new Eco packaging is cool.The album is just ok for me. The songs are from early in hiscareer and they are way too 50's do wop and crooner for me.
4,A suspense thriller with a touch of Cinderella,"Linda Martin, a young Englishwoman with no family, takes a position as a governess to a young boy who is living with his uncle and aunt on the estate he will inherit. Linda is desperate to get out of her current situation, so she hides the fact that she grew up in France and can speak fluent French. She finds the uncle to be a charismatic but imposing figure, even though he is confined to a wheelchair, he is a powerful man. Things start to become unusual when ""accidents"" occur that could have killed Phillipe. To make matters more interesting, the uncle's's son, Raoul comes to the chateau and is a younger, dashing version of his father. Linda begins to suspect that someone is trying to kill Phillipe and she must find a way to save him, even if it means giving up the man she loves. This was a well paced romance/thriller and I found it to be engaging."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"This is the first Mary Stewart novel I've read and while I enjoyed the book's atmosphere and lead characters, I was a bit let down by the plot on the whole.From reviews I had read, I was hoping for a dark and intricately plotted mystery. While there were several very suspenseful passages, the story was a bit too predictable and the ending seemed to drag on a little too long.I did enjoy the fact that 'Nine Coaches Waiting' is mainly a mystery with just a sprinkling of romance. However, I felt that even with the main focus not on the romance, that part of the story could have been handled a lot better. The romantic entanglements between the two main protagonists seem much too rushed and unrealistic.All that being said, I still enjoyed reading 'Nine Coaches Waiting' (even though it did not live up to expectations)and will give the author's other books a try."
5,A Keeper,"A Cinderella story. I loved it when I read it years ago. I have continued to re-read it. And I love it now.My public library had to dig it up from the hidden stacks, but a few years back I checked out and read The Revenger's Tragedy, which Stewart quotes as epigrams before chapters. I fell in love with Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" after reading ""This Rough Magic,"" and other novels assume a knowledge of Greek drama. It's great to see this new edition, but I wonder if a Gothic romance of this erudition could be published today."
3,Not hilarious but exciting,"I read it in one rush - something I do not with many books.As mostly the blurb blurts blurring words. Its not comedy but humorous and self-ironical sword & sorcery.So if you look for a Terry Pratchett, Robert Rankin, Ester Friesner, Robert Asprin, Tom Holt or something like that - this book is none of that. But it's a little bit like Simon Green."
5,hiden treasure,I love these books. My husband and I read them together. They're just a riot! I think it's a shame that they're not more readily available and mainstream.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Very funny. This one made me laugh out loud several times. Thraxas is a man you want at your side. Although maybe not when you are having pizza, or it is your shout and you are trying to keep up. :) Despite a lot of fondness for various narcotics, intoxicants and baked goods, Thraxas knows where his towel is. The half-orc with the pointy ears does cause him many problems, but is incredibly good at the slayage when he needs a hand."
1,HATE IT! Gag-o-licious. Migraine Causer. Soap from HELL,"OMG, someone really thought this carp was a GOOD idea?How can I get this stench off my hands?I washed my hands with it once. Once I tell you.Total migraine.I bring my hands towards my face and I want to puke.How can I get rid of this STENCH? I've washed my hands over and overwith other soaps and CANNOT get this reek off my digits."
4,Great book!,"I bought this book because are planning a trip to Cape Cod. It was very informative and answered all of my questions. I highly recommend it if you have children because it offered hints and tips about traveling with children, price ranges for each activity and things you should not miss while in each vacation spot. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the format. Sometimes a ""hint"" or description of a place would start in the middle of a page that was describing something else. It was a bit confusing at first. Otherwise it was well written and informative. I feel prepared to leave for Cape Cod (or any New England spot) today!!"
2,OK,"I grew up in New England and wanted to get a refresher. It was OK but I wanted more.It was geared to entertaining a family with young kids, not us any more."
5,Kudos to Dr. Gimbutas,"An eminently readable scholarly discussion of the trails of artifacts left in the wake of Ancient and forgotten civilizations, this book should be required to be at least overviewed by every educated human being.The scope of this book is vast, and the depth of the research and presentation of facts is so multilayered that there are some hidden gems in the pictures that Dr. Gimbutas could only gloss over. Dr. Gimbutas herself might have been surprised at learning more about these gems. These are trails for future research.I give this professor an A+ for being the pioneer at the boundary of inquiry about one of the most important FORMATIVE periods in the history of Humankind.""Civilization of the Goddess"" is one of the all-time iconoclastic and CORRECT pieces of scholarly research. And, we all know what happens to the old guard protecting ancient secrets, when the ""paradigm"" shifts to something that is both correct and iconoclastic...."
3,good deal for the cost,"i bought these jus as get me by's and they def do that. although after hooking em up i found out my crossover network was also bad in one of my jrx 125's but believe it or not just the one side had enough highs to make the sound in a local venue clearer, so im sure with 2 itll be better. i mean i wouldnt think of using these full time but they are a good, cheap sub when you dont have enough for a higher quality item."
4,This is da bomb,"I really, really enjoy this CD. It's good for listening with headphones or putting on Surround Sound and dancing to it. My favorite mixes are the Album Version, Almighty Definitive Mix, Phat 'N' Phunky Mix, Xenomania.........mix. By the way: Amazon says that there is 1 song. This is partially true. Believe is a CD single with only 1 SONG, Believe, but 10 TRACKS. 10 mixes of Believe. This is a GREAT uptempo CD. I'd really suggest to buy it."
4,Really different from her other stuff!!!!!,"I was pleasantly surprised, its a bit funkier than her normal stuff and i really like it!!!!"
3,I BELIEVE IT'S A CASE OF OVERKILL,"While the single is a strong one, deserving of a remix or two, seventy minutes of the same lyric, although altered, is just too much of a good thing. As the owner of the disc, I find myself listening to maybe 2/3 of the release, selecting only the tracks that I deem worthy of the song and the artist.This is one definitely for the DIE-HARD, CHER-CAN'T-DO-NO-WRONG fan.I haven't quite reached that plateau."
5,Absolutely LOVE IT!,"Cher once again has produced a compilation that takes you from the dance floor....to a romantic candle-light dinner....""Believe"" is a fantasic driving song!"
5,SUPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRR!,"ESTA CANCION ES LA MEJOR QUE CHER HA HECHO EN TODA SU CARRERA MUSICAL, ES LO MAXIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, ES GENIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!, SUPER!...CREEN EN LA VIDA DESPUES DEL AMOR? (DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE AFTER LOVE?)...."
1,"Is that Cher's voice? Oh, no..it is a computer.","This bland techno-pop single isn't worth getting unless you are a BIG Cher fan. Her voice has been run through SO many computer effects, it hardly sounds human. Don't stop here...find a better CD here to spend your money on."
5,It was the best cd I ever listened to,cher may be the only one now but together with sonny they were awesome too!!!!!!! GOOD JOB PRODUCERS YOUR #1!!!!!!!
3,"Unusual, but beautiful. My son says ""Too much 'club' music.""","Cher does herself proud on this CD, but the music is better used as club, or dance music- or even better, to clean your house by! This CD really rocks! Cher's voice has improved with age, or with electronic enhancement, I'm not sure which. I still love the CD."
5,"IT WAS AWESOME! BEA- THACHALOVE, lol","This is a great CD, all of you should get this, it was a great impact on me because when my friend Bea was in the hospital because she got hit by a car, they played this song for her and she felt like people loved her. IT IS A GREAT CD!"
5,she's great good music?,her music it's great i love her new album even though i love all of cher's music ever since i was born.
4,B ook,This was bought as a sculptural reference book. It's great. It has great pictures and reference informtion in it. Thanks
1,IDK why?,I bought this thinking it was like anouther product i perchased befour and the pills are so differint as well as the cream.was going to return it but thought about it more and thought i would give it a try.needless to say that i am alergic to the cream and have had cemical burn on my chest for a week or more. so this is why i only rated one star tho i should go with none but i have still taken the pills and have had no change yet.but i hope they will work without the cream.
4,Better than the tension-mount ones!,"I had a paper towel holder that used tension to ""squeeze"" the roll, but eventually it lost its squeeze. This one is different, and it does a great job. The only negative is that you can't pull UP as you take a towel off the roll, or it'll pop out of this holder. That hasn't been a big deal for me -- I just pull to the side or down."
4,BEST HOLDER EVER,"EASY loading and removal of roll. Never seen another like it. Works really great. Mounting was easy and unit works well. Only drawback was my housekeeper works really fast and she sometimes is agressive in removing the paper roll. She has broken one of the units. As long as you are a little careful, the unit should last a lifetime."
1,Flying paper towels,"This thing is awful! Every time you touch it, the whole roll of towels comes flying off. I replaced an old broken down metal holder with this one. I should have kept the broken one. It was better."
1,Rubbermaid towel holder,"Reading the reviews of this thing makes me think that there is more than one version of this model; I don't know how anyone could give it even one star if they are all the same as the one that I had. I put one in my garage and found the one that I had to be most unsatisfactory. The arms are spaced too far apart, hence there is no braking tension on the roll and the roll would occasionally fall out when I tried to tear off a towel (of necessity using two hands to keep the roll from spinning). The little spring-loaded ""ears"" that retract into the arms for loading the roll are spring loaded by a sort of plastic bar spring, one of which broke after a very short period of time, rendering the thing useless. I was almost glad when it broke since I then had no guilt when I threw it in the trash."
4,very nice paper towel holder,"This white towel holder is cleanly designed and keeps the towel roll on the rack. Some people said they had trouble removing the label, but it came of very easily with a little care in removing it. Glad we bought it."
5,Perfect,This is exactly what I needed. I got tired of my paper towels falling every time I torn one off. This is a very sturdy holder that keeps the paper towel roll in place reliably.
4,A durable towel holder but difficult to pull off a single sheet with one hand,"This is a very solid paper towel holder and it does load easily. The only negative comment I have is that because there is no tension of the roll, it's difficult to just pull off a single sheet without using two hands. I have no doubt that it will last a long time and I'd buy it again."
1,Way too wide for a roll of paper towels,"I found this to be useless -- it's way too wide to properly hold a roll of paper towels. A roll of paper towels is barely 10-7/8"" wide. The arms on this holder are 11-1/2"" apart. So the roll of towels just flops around awkwardly, offering no grip or resistance and barely staying on the holder! I threw this out and found a wall-mount holder that works a lot better:HOLDER PAPER TOWEL WHITEby Spectrum. There are possibly also others that hold well; I wanted a white, non-metal holder, so I went with that and it works fine."
1,Too Wide,"It is that simple, the towels stay on fine IF you don't touch them or only pull the paper to one side. The oppposite of snug!I called Rubbermaid and I am supposed to get a different product at a store."
5,Best Designed Paper Towel Holder Ever - Highly Recommended!,"The Rubbermaid Paper Towel Holder is nothing short of wonderful! It's hard to get excited about something as seemingly mundane as a paper towel holder, but we use a lot of paper towels every day.The spring loaded grips are what makes this model work so much better than other designs. Changing a roll of paper towels can be done one-handed and the grips extend deeply into the tube so the roll doesn't pop off when ripping off a paper towel sheet. The spring loaded grips can be adjusted to accommodate wall mounting or under the counter hanging, just check that the flat side is taking the weight of the roll.We liked the first one we bought for our kitchen so much that we went to the expense and trouble to replaced three of the old paper towel holders in our shop with this model.Highly Recommended!"
3,Impossible to remove label,"The paper towel holder itself works great--just as the manufacturer claims. What you can't tell until you get it, though, is that there's a red label proudly proclaiming ""Rubbermaid"" all the way across the holder (not something a person generally wants as part of the kitchen aesthetic), and it's one of those nasty plastic ones that comes apart in pieces and resists label remover products. It took an hour and a considerable amount of label remover to get the label off. Manufacturers need to respect consumers' time in producing packaging."
3,Only OK,"It holds the roll on, but the reviewer that said ""not snug"" got it right. If you don't use a quick, sidewards tug the roll will spin out about 6-8 additional paper segments. I expected a better design from a company like Rubbermaid."
1,easy to fall out!,"It is easy to change the paper towels, but the paper towel roll falls out after even a gentle touch. Not recommended"
4,"Good, Study Towel Dispenser - Great for busy kitchen",This product is sturdy. The towels can be changed in a flash. I use it in my professional kitchen because the towels can be changed by sliding the old out and the new in with one hand.
3,Idiots with Adhesive,The towel holder is acceptable; however Rubbermaid attached a large sticker to this towel holder which was very difficult to remove. Unless your room would be enhanced by an instructional label on towel holders be prepared to spend 15 minutes or so removing this sticker.
4,A good book,"Usually I don't read romance , but the cover of the book captivated me. This was a good book but it seemed like there were to many stories the author was trying to tell , I would rather for the author to have focused on the couple."
3,"Not bad, could be better","I bought this KVM because I needed one that worked with Windows 7 (many do not). It actually works, which is good. However, it is missing some features that I consider important: a microphone connection, and buttons on the actual switch to change the input computer. Also, the audio wire is too short to reach across my laptop, which places the input on the opposite side as the VGA input. I don't know of any better KVM that is compatible with Windows 7 for under $100 so I guess this is as good as it gets."
5,Love these mugs!,"I'd originally ordered the green mugs. I got gold. So I contacted Amazon and asked them to send me the green ones. I got gold again. Even though they don't match my dishes, I decided to keep them because I love the look and feel of them... large and solid, but comfortable to hold. The one thing I'm not crazy about is the smudges of color on the inside of the mug (not in picture). Other than that, they're perfect.Edited to add: One of the mugs cracked in the microwave the first time it was used. I was disappointed, but the other mugs have performed just fine in the microwave."
4,good value,"I needed a chair for work, and I am very pleased with the back support that this chair gives me. As a nurse, I have to hop in and out of the chair all day, but I get a good support which I needed due to a recent back injury. The chair is strong and seems very durable, and I am pleased with it, especially for the price.The thing I did not like was the assembly directions, which were pretty much non-existant, so hopefully you have a good visual grasp on how this chair goes together. After a few trial and errors we figured it out. The pictures do not show all sides, so it did not help with our assembly dilemna."
3,hard to understand instructions,"the instructions were hard to understand and if you want to adjust the lowest height setting, it is hard to take apart but it is a comfortable chair."
3,"Carl, please don't sing.","Look, Carl Verheyen is an exceptional blues/rock/fusion guitarist. His playing on this album is terrific (as usual) and his band is right on the money, too. But if you're reading this you're probably a guitar player and have little use for vocals even when the singer is great. Maybe its just me but when Carl Verheyen sings about ""revolution"" or ""funky"" its like Pat Boone singing heavy metal or Sammy Davis' recording of Shaft. He's just got one of those squeeky-clean Golden Throats. What is it that gives fine players the urge to sing? If you're not familiar with this outstanding player, check out No Borders which is all instrumental and kills."
1,Failed to unlock after one year,"I was unable to unlock this lock after one year of use. I was careful not to get the lock wet. It is fairly bulky and heavy, which may make it resistant to thieves. By comparison, my previous bike lock from Krypto lasted 18 years."
1,"Thanks, OnGuard.","I had my brand new bike locked up with one of these. The first day I had the bike, and it was stolen. And yes, it was locked the right way. Through the fork, wheel, frame, and bike rack.I don't know how they did it. They took the lock with them. But now I'm out several hundred dollars until I can work out a deal with OnGuard.I would recommend spending the extra money and buying the absolute best lock you can."
1,Won't buy print-on-demand books again,"This book was printed on demand. The book comes with clear qualifications about the scanning process that enabled printing. Unfortunately, this process means that the original pagination was lost, as was the table of contents. The text is hard to read, and the page numbers won't be useful for citing in academic works. I won't buy a print-on-demand book again unless it is simply a scan and reprint of the original text as-is. I'd rather read a copy of the original on Google Books."
3,OK 2nd solo album,"The first member of Bone to break away and go solo comes back almost 4 years after his debut with an average album. I like his debut better. There's no denying he can flow but this album didn't catch my ear that much. 13 songs again (like his debut) 2 are good, the rest are average, 1 I skip. Guests are on 4 songs rapping and 1 doing the hook so you get a good deal of the 5th Dog. Production is also average (oddly cause the main producer on here usually has tight beats). Damon Elliot did 10 of the songs, Professor did 2 and Rhythm D did the other 1. A good album to have for die hard Bone fans but not the best Bone release.#1 - 6 (has a 4 minute into before the song)#2 - 7 (f/ Montell Jordan)#3 - 7 (f/ Layzie Bone & Ms. Chaz)#4 - 6.5 (f/ Layzie Bone & Wish Bone)#5 - 8#6 - 5#7 - 6#8 - 6.5#9 - 6.5 (f/ Kurupt)#10 - 8#11 - 7#12 - 7#13 - 7 (f/ BG Knocc Out & Damon Elliot)Stanley Howse -- b. 6/10/73 -- Cleveland, OHCheck all my Reviews"
2,ok album,"this album is just average at the most. i do not recomend it unless your a bone fan. he's first album was better, but i didnt think that one was to great either. sad cause i like flesh on the bone albums. but when it time to drop solo he falls short."
5,good info,"A lot of info is in this book. The book came in a timely manner, and very informative. vitamins listed in this book to take on a daily bais was listed."
1,"It's ok, but...",Not at all what I expected. A very OLD book. The date of it should be more prominent when advertising it!
1,Just don't deal with customer service,"After subscribing to Quilters World since 2001, I suspended my subscription for a year while we traveled in Europe. When I tried to resume my subscription they told me my subscription would be resumed through 2007 even though my subscription (verified on my magazine's label) was until 2011.These people are happy to rip you off.Follow-up: They did eventually fix the problem but it took 2 months, 4 phone calls, and the label from an old issue mailed to them. I would upgrade this to 3 stars or delete the review but Amazon doesn't seem to have that facility."
3,Furry sound and all,"I bought this CD because I can't find certain tracks elsewhere. The Charlie Rich catalogue is in a mess - cheap 2-on-1's, rubbish compilations. And these days, we are not always able to listen on speakers - neighbors, kids, police - so we put on the headphones... Lo and behold: the sound quality here is very poor indeed. It's a terrible shame that, 20 years into the digital remastering era, this man's work is still only allowed bargain bin status. Someone please get to work on the late 60's - mid 70's recordings of Charlie Rich. This stuff was recorded in the best studios by the best producers and musicians - so why does it sound so bad? And before someone starts burbling about free downloads... they're sourced from the same rubbish sounding CD's...Where else can you complain? Does anyone with the power to rectify such problems read these reviews? This disc has some of CR's best songs on it, hence the 3 stars. Charlie Rich - some of us love you and care about the music very much."
5,a pleasureable listen,Every track is a winner and of course songs like A Very Special Love Song and Rollin' With the Flow are classics . Just such an easy listen .If you like Charlie Rich every good song of his is represented.
4,Great ballads,Forgot how much I enjoyed his music. This cd is wonderful. The Silver Fox lives on. Does not have all of my favorites but it comes close.
3,Pretty Good,"I got into Charlie Rich when I first heard ""A Very Special Love Song"" and bought his Super Hits, but this is a much better collection. Granted he wasn't very country, but he has a great voice."
2,Why Do They Feel They Must CHANGE???,"I always loved Charlie Rich for his music. This CD is a huge disappointment to me. He, like so many others of the ""great"" in country music, seems to believe he must ""update"" his music. Poor choice. We purchase their music BECAUSE of their old style. Charlie Rich really screwed the pooch on this one with his updated style. New and Improved ought to be left to those who actually NEED improvement. Rich does not qualify for that group. It sounds like he is singing in a cheap French cabaret, and that he is bored out of his mind to boot. And his rendition of America The Beautiful and Amazing Grace is, well, DISGRACEFUL!! The reason I gave two stars is for the obviously old recording of a few of his ""old"" songs. Without them, I would rate this at a sub-zero. Sorry to see such a talent going sour."
3,Stick vacuum,Does a good job but is heavy ...was thinking I had ordered a vacuum without a cord...but will enjoy using as a hand held.
1,danesco egg beater,"I was VERY disappointed in this egg beater. Doesn't turn freely, spokes were bent, catches on itself. I wouldn't recommend this egg beater to anyone, especially for $33."
4,Controversial because this author tells it like it is.,"The accurate portrayal of the honest experiences of a gay man who discovers his true sexuality when he was employed by his church's headquarters office. Although he reports some unpleasant facts about his conflicts in living, this story has the ring of truth. While, no one but the author can attest to the supernatural experiences he reports, this has always been the case with true mystics. The universe holds no secrets and this book is only one way that truth is coming to light. The author ends the story by telling of how he learned to forgive an abusive partriarchal hierarchy and, go on with his life liberated from the lies of his past. The first chapter has been published in award-winning anthologies, including: Wrestling With The Angel and Searching For Your Soul."
3,a book that changed my life,"I'm not gay but I was a Mormon. Feliz's book literally changed my life because after reading it I was encouraged to start really exploring the teachings and history of Mormonism. The result was I got out and was freed from such an oppressive, soul-destroying institution. Frankly, I thought Feliz's spiritual journey became pretty flakey but his observations on Mormonism and how the Church would hurt people was unimpeachable. Thanks, Tony, for having the guts to say what had to be said."
4,Read it from cover to cover!,I am an active member of the LDS (Mormon) Church and I found great comfort in reading this book a few years back. Many Church members will automatically disregard what this man has said. But most of that is because they don't want to look past their own fears. Look past your own fears and read this book from cover to cover.
1,"Serious reservations about author,","I agree with the suggestion on checking out this author's background. You can't believe everything one says or writes. I know this author well...he is a relative. And just note, we come from different religious faiths, so this isn't a pro-Mormon commentary."
1,Serious reservations about author,I would check into the background of this author before taking anything he says too seriously.
3,"Blake poems not complete w/o the images. Add A Blake Dictionary and Blake, Jung and the Collective Unconscious to understand him","Add ""A Blake Dictionary"" and ""Blake, Jung and the Collective Unconscious"" by June Singer to understand him.He is a year's study. And I am at it. Fascinating. lynn scott"
5,almost,"but not quite 5 stars, as the sound is a bit dodgy in spots. still, this two-fer is an extremely reasonably-priced way to get yourself acquainted with the proto-world music that the pocket trumpet/piano/flute great was making in the early 70s. a Cherry/Han Bennink duo is featured on the first half of disc one, with the remainder of that disc and the entirety of the second given over to the trio of Cherry, Johnny Dyani and Okay Temiz. just check it out..."
1,IT'S A BOOK BUT NOT REALLY A BOOK!,"In my view, this is the worst book ever printed; it's acctually not a book because it has NO informations or anything you can learn from; it shows pictures and pictures of Omega watches. One watch pictured for the whole big page leaving much empty space. It's such a waste of paper and ink printing this so-call book."
3,OMEGA WATCHES - GIAMPIERO NEGRETTI,"Of course this is 100% personal view. Mine is that it is a nice book to look at, a picture book.I miss information with the pictures as one cannot find reference n of the watches, date of production , calibre used ,etc. Some brief info together with the pictures would have been very nice to have.I like it anyway but I miss the above mentioned info very much.Best regards+++jmbanzo, Spain."
4,The Cannons of Destruction have returned!,"Rising Out of the Ashes is the comeback album from the underground classic American power metal band Warlord. Coming 16 years after the band's last release, original members William Tsamis and Mark Zonder (Fates Warning) teamed up with none other than Hammerfall vocalist Joacim Cans to release an album of (mostly) new Warlord material.Rising Out of the Ashes featured a reworked version of the song ""Lucifer's Hammer"", as well as 8 new songs. The album is a worthy addition to the Warlord catalog, and sounds like it could have been released during the band's Metal Blade days. It's epic in an old-school way, without the symphonic touches of modern power metal. The lyrics, like all good 80's power metal, focus on science-fiction, fantasy, mythology, and the occult. This is classic power metal from start to finish, and should appeal to fans of classic bands like Fifth Angel, Crimson Glory, Warrior, and much of the NWOBHM movement."
5,A Hilarious Book For Everybody!,"Mike Reiss is one of the funniest guys in the world - from his work on ""The Simpsons"" to all his kids books, the guy is a bazillion laughs.And ""The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln"" is his best book yet. It combines that great skewed ""Simpsons""-style take on history with a really sweet story about fitting in, a story that everyone can relate to. A story that's especially valuable for young kids.But adults will enjoy it, too and not just because of Mike Reiss's funny writing. The illustrations are wonderful and amusing.This book has quickly become one of our kids' favorites. And I'm always happy when they pull it off the bookshelf and ask us to read it to them."
1,BEWARE: Not suitable for kids!,"This book is about kids who look ""different"". It starts out nice, but then a kid looks like a ""horse's butt"" and then on the last page there is a child who looks like the male anatomy and his name is ""little dicky"". TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR KIDS!"
5,My favorite children's book,This is my favorite children's book although I am 72 years old and gave it to my daughter and friend. Has a great message and is so funny.
3,"Funny, but a bit strange...","Overall, I found the premise of this picture book to be very entertaining and original, and the illustrations really brought out the humor in the book. But, this book IS aimed for the younger reader (age 5-9, I presume) and some of the language used is just not appropriate, especially the signs held up by the audience in the final pages of the book. I know the author is also a writer for the TV show ""The Simpsons"", but I think he could have gotten his point across just as effectively without the use of the weird humor at the end. I just think it could have been written with the same originality without the ""put-down"" humor that was used."
1,Horrible book for kids!,"I'm a volunteer librarian for my kids Christian school. I was shocked to find this book was purchased 4 years ago for our library. Today a parent who was reading it to her 5 yr. old pointed out some pictures on the book which were a bit offensive, especially the last page. I diagree with several posters, the people I asked all thought it had similarities to a male part not a past president. I will be burning this book. I don't feel this humor is appropriate for children and can't believe its classified as a picture book/easy reader and marketed for small children."
1,Not something I'm going to buy.,"This book is geared towards 4-8 year olds, but with the adult humor, make sure you read this yourself before purchasing it for any child. I recently was involved in a book fair where we hid this book because it was felt to be inappropriate for the children involved."
1,Appalled by some of the Adult Humor,"When I purcahsed this book I read through most of the pages and thought the book had some merit. The books highlights a boy who looks strange-like Abe Lincoln and has a low self-esteem. His parents ship him off to a camp where he meets other kids that are unusual as well. However, the adult humor at the end of the book was appalling, at best. I was completely shocked when I read the last page to my kids. You'll have to read the book for yourself but up until the last page, I was convinced this was both age and content appropriate. I think authors have an obligation to write ""clean"" books-kids grow up so fast these days that some youngsters may even get the adult humor on the last page. I can't imagine such bad taste coming from a children's book author :("
1,A book that shouldn't have been published.,"I am an elementary school teacher, and saw this book at our book fair. I am abohorred that a publisher would even publish this book for children. The last line of the story makes reference to something that is completely inappropriate for ALL children. The picture that goes along with it (on the last page) is even more shocking! My school librarian pulled every copy of this book off the shelf, and every other teacher/parent who read this book found it to be inappropriate as well. Do NOT buy this book for your child!! It would be funny on an adult coffee table, but it should not have been made for children."
2,Did not like.,I picked this book up from the library because I am a huge fan of David Catrow's quirky illustrations. I wish I would have just admired the art work and ignored Reiss' story. It is funny but in an offensive inappropriate for children sort of way
1,Caution,"This is a great gag gift for an adult who enjoys children's books and/or presidential history. But it really isn't appropriate for children. I'm not trying to be a stick in the mud, I'm not a robot, I give my children all the intellectual credit they deserve, but the under 8 crowd is just not going to see the Richard Nixon joke. The book has a great message and I love how Benjy comes back from summer camp to tell the bullies just what he is thinkin'... I just don't need to give a moral message a gimmicky and crude spin to interest my kids. They are better than this and deserve more."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this book for my love of David Catrow illustrations. Catrow proved once again to be a very talented artist making the pictures very comical. There is an excellent moral to the story about being happy with who you are no matter how others may tease you. I must say that the last page with baby brother Dickie is probably the most entertaining! Yes, Richard Nixon even gets some lime light in the end!However, some of the humor seems more for adults. Did Reiss really need to include a horse's butt? I also do see how some people may see some male anatomy on the Richard Nixon page.I'm very torn about this book. I thoroughly enjoy it, but know it may offend others which is why I am weary about using it in my classroom. I truly can see this book going either way."
2,"A bit cheesy to say the least. Too bad, Fuller used to be a good company with a good product.","Obviously some third world country bought the name Fuller. They are cheap quality metal, finish and fit. The price fits the tool however and i am not complaining, only reviewing. If you want Snap On, buy Snap On."
5,Interesting human drama,"I have read all of rebecca Shaw's novels, having first found them in Britain.They are centered on small casts of characters living together in small rural settings. She uses this arrangment to comment on the current state of society in Britain and to describe the foibles of humankind. I find them amusing and entertaining. They are not weepy, female fiction, but they do focus on the interaction of the characters. If you enjoy this sort of story that takes its force from the characters rather than the action, you will like these books."
5,Generation X's theme movie!!!!,"A movie for all who grew up in the 80's. Definative a time when parents were to busy to care, and kids to appethetic to think. A must see."
4,Original version of Tierra Gitana,"I purchased this album a few years after purchasing its US version Tierra Gitana, mainly for the instrumental ""Forever"" which was replaced with Los Peces en el Rio on Tierra Gitana. I actually prefer the US version. While I like the instrumental, Los Peces... is a much better song, one of the best on the album. It's fast, has a good rhythm, and a great vocal by Nicholas (helped out by Patchai). Also, Estrellas doesn't seem to flow as well as Tierra Gitana. Maybe I just got used to the running order of Tierra Gitana. The one bonus on Estrellas is that it actually has a booklet with photos and lyrics, which was a pleasant surprise! So, if for nothing else, this makes it a good purchase. If you don't really care about this, then you're better off buying the US version as it will probably be cheaper."
1,"Modern, Intellectual, Conservative? Oxymorons","America is being remade, but not by these guys. A hollywood B actor, an adulterer, and other assorted criminals. Not that many of those on the other side are a lot better. Start thinking, judging each candidate for who he tells you he is. They usually do. Deep insight?"
2,Overrated,An artist more heard about than heard. The rave reviews for Sill's music are undeserved. Maybe she is a critic's darling because of her heroin addiction and subsequent prostitution. Save your money.P.S. Some people were upset by my comments it would seem. I find her Noo York Squawk intrusive and the mannered style of singing somewhat similar to Rickie Lee Jones in the grip of the grape. The melodies (?) are uncertain to say the least and I truly wonder why she has garnered such rave reviews over the years. Sorry folks it doesn't do it for me.
2,"Relaxing; Yes, Motivating: No",These CDs are relaxing and I agree that They can be a great decompressor at night with weight loss suggestions to boot. However I wouldn't boast that it is a driving force in weight loss suggestions for the rest of the day. It is too expensive for the little effect you get.
2,didn't help me,"I purchased this specific cd set because it was recommended by a doctor who I read and obtain alot of information from via the web. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. I have listened to alot of hypnosis cds in my time and this one just didn't click with me. May work for other people, just not me."
3,Blows Air but not with thermostat,"I ordered with the comparable ventless garage heater which works fine but when I installed the blower it will only work in manual mode. Fan will not come on using heat-sensing thermostat setting. Even in manual mode the fan buzzes and rattles terribly. Installs easy but the cord is only about four foot long, impossible to reach an outlet since you never want to install such a heater that close to an outlet anyway. Then when I wanted to return under warranty you have to call the manufacturer direct to work out an exchange, etc. This manufacturer is not a consumer friendly one. Now I have to pay the shipping all over. Seems like the heater should have been offered with the fan option already installed. I guess this way they can get another $50 out of you and make the heater seem competitive with the alternatives that include a fan for more $$."
1,not good,"This thing barley puts out any air. Before I even attached it to my heater, I plugged it in and turned it on. I could not even feel any air blowing on my hand from only 2 feet away! The other bad thing about this is that the cord is only about 3' long so unless you are installing your heater directly over an outlet(I did not), your gonna need an extension cord. It also seems a little noisy for the little amount of air it puts out. I am going to keep this but only because it is better than nothing."
2,Fan does not operate on AUTO mode,"I purchased the 30K BTU heater and this fan from Menards. The heater works great. This auxiliary fan works good on ""ON"" mode but not on ""AUTO"" mode. It blows a nice amount of air to help circulate the heated air. I called ProCom and they said they had some trouble with these and that I should bent the bracket with the sensor down toward the flame. That didn't help. One time the fan ran for about a minute then turned back off so I know the wires are connected. It seems that the sensor, which is mounted on the end of a sheetmetal L bracket, is not close enough to the metal divider between the flame and the cavity where the blower is. I returned the blower to Menards and exchanged it for a new one. Same results. I may make a new bracket that is a little longer so the sensor is tight against the metal divider to get a better heat transfer to the sensor. 2 stars because the blower only works good on ""ON"" mode."
3,TRIAL BY JURY - Gilbert & Sullivan's short comedy,"Although I've never actually been in the show, a friend gave me a copy of the vocal score. After downloading MIDI versions of the songs (I'm not a very good piano player), I fell in love with the comedic songs. This is light opera at its best! If you are involved with an amateur/high school group, this is an ideal production. It is approx. 30-45 minutes in length and is full of comedy and wit.However, I only rate it 3 stars do to the fact that this is British humor (not that I don't like British humor--some people have a hard time understanding it) and the tunes (though funny) are hardly ""catchy.""The score contains 15 songs (and my personal favorite is the Judge's ""When I, Good Friends, Was Called to the Bar"")It should be noted that this particular version of the score contains optional notes for amateur groups."
2,Breaks easily,"In the last couple of years, I have purchased four of these units. The attenuator works very well until the cord wears out right where it comes out of the base. The motion of normal use causes the cord to pull away from its connection inside, and one channel cannot be heard. It is quite disappointing."
4,Great for Airplanes!,"If you're a frequent flier, this is a must-have accessory for your Shure E-series canalphones. The output from the headset jack on major airlines is overpowered in order to drive the cheap headphones they give out, as well as to overcome the engine roar and cabin noise. Anyone who has plugged in their Shures or other high-quality canalphones to an airline seat knows that it cannot be set at a low enough level for comfortable listening, nor can it be finely tuned between volume steps... the Shure Level Attenuator has a thumbwheel volume control, is inexpensive, and should be with you every time you fly."
3,"Excellent sound for the price, but...","Excellent sound quality compared to other attenuators I've used previously. As my Shure earphones produce such a loud sound, even with very little input (a sign of a good sound-isolating earphone in my opinion), an in-line volume control is a necessity. The complaint I have against Shure's volume control is its connector. As I use my earphones mostly with my smartphone, I always have the in-line microphone connected. The volume control does not pass-thru the audio input, so it must be connected above the microphone. The angle connector makes this very awkward, and although it is fairly light, it still puts a good deal of weight on the earphones.Despite my complaint, it is still the best deal for the price in my opinion."
4,Does the job,I needed a little attenuator (volume control) so I didn't have to dig my mp3 player out of my pocket every time to boost or lower the volume. The first one I bought from Amazon was dead on arrival but they have a great return policy and even sent out a new one immediately while I sent the bad one back. The second one works fine and it does what it's supposed to do. I don't find any diminished quality of the music so I'm very happy with the purchase. I like the short cord too.Worth the $10.
2,Broke after 8 month,"Bought this to use with Blackberry as the lowest volume setting on there was too loud. It worked well for 8 months then stopped functioning. I was expecting better quality from Shure. If you just want to use it with a headphone, you may be better off by getting one with in-line volume control. I have an in-ear headphone from Sony with in-line volume control and it's working great right now."
2,For Airplanes only,"I thought that I was purchasing a volume controller. This item only works on airplanes. The information on the item was not clear,"
5,Great account from an ignored theater of operations.,"I am a big fan of this book. The author was a human guinea pig who was sent to a front line fighter group with minimal training, as the government wanted to see how little training pilots could receive and still be effective and survive. This is not the usual account of a figher pilot, who normally tells you exactly how good he was. He candidly informs you how unprepared he was. The title says it all. I am also glad to hear about a unit and theater of war that is not often written about or published. The Eighth Airforce and the Fifteenth Airforce were partners that worked together to keep the enemy off balance. Together they did much to finish Nazi Germany. The Mighty Eighth is well covered in many books, especially a handful of groups. You could fit all that is written on the fifteenth on a short shelf. I found the author engaging and humorous. He also helps you see the ugly side of war, even though he flies the ""glamorous"" P-51 Mustang."
5,"Humble hero of the ""Greatest Generation""","The author served in the same fighter squadron as the man that I was later named after, who like many others gave the ultimate sacrifice. I found this book very enlightening, because it is not just a recount of the military strategy and the tactics of air battles, but a broad description of the culture, technology, training and hardships of a very young man doing his patriotic duty with honor. Mr Curtis reveals some of the reckless and foolish things that he and others did, and the lucky and un-lucky pilots that he served with. His colorful descriptions of the pilot's life in P-51 Mustangs and in Italy paint an vivid picture. The long-distance love story with his one-and-only Myrt adds another dimension."
3,Dumb but Lucky!,"Well written but ultimately lacking any big set piece action. The author had a major upheaval in his life caused by the war and his wartime service, and he explains the nuts and bolts of learning to fly, then training on, and flying a cutting edge fighter - the Mustang - very well. But his wartime service in Italy appears to be mainly long spells of grinding boredom interspersed with brief spells of action. For anyone interested in the day to day routine of learning to fly, then operational life as a normal everyday pilot in a fighter squadron, this is a well written and good book. However for anyone interested in the ""edited highlights"" of the cut and thrust of combat only, this book will be a disappointment. There are also no particularly shocking or even exciting ""confessions"""
1,"Dumb Book, Lucky he got published","My Grandma taught me that if I can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. God Bless Richard Curtis; he was smart enough to survive, and still lucky enough to get this book published. At the very least he contributed to the strength of our numbers at a time of World War, but he reveals precious little more about the times except to say that he was there, and lived to tell the tale. Perhaps that is all there was to tell; personally, I made a point of reading the book through to the very last page so I can be sure that I never buy the book again under the impression that it is substantive history of the time, and the war he went off to fight. SEE D. DECKER'S REVIEW ABOVE."
1,Mag check for manifold pressure???,"I guess time fades a person's memory but a mag check for manifold pressure to determine if there was enough power to take off?? After reading several first person books by several Aces that served in the same place at the same time, flying the same missions (only flying as much as 150 missions to fulfill their tour, as opposed to Curtis' 50) and being involved in the same events, I have to say that this book is a very amateurish attempt. Mostly about his foolish, immature and boastful attitudes. I wasted my time and money on this funnybook."
3,Eno is a bit of a screwball,"Well, here he is. Brian Eno. I'm glad to see that this stuff made it to the DVD format as I have both videos on VHS. However, I'm not planning on buying the video in the new format. Once I turned my TV on its side to watch a video and the television had to be degaused. Pretty funny, Eno. Nice one. If you have a television you can spare, I would highly recommend forever leaving it on its side to view the video properly. Of course that adds to the cost of the piece. Or perhaps you could have surgery to make yourself sideways turned permanently. I enjoy Eno's silliness those days I have tolerance for it."
1,Do not buy it,Unless you are a fan of Brian Eno. The videos are way too dark in color and nothing you couldn't do with your DV camera. If you buy it you will take a look at it and put it for sale again or leaving it aside collecting dust.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"The potential viewer will gain a greater sense of how far America has come, spiritually, over the last few centuries. This video looks at the various church denominations and movements in the United States. It spotlights several Christian churches from almost all socio-economic and racial backgrounds. I watched it during a History of Christianity class and was surprised me because I am an alumni of Word of Life Bible Institute in Schroon Lake. It hit on the fundamentalist movement that influenced camps and schools like Word of Life."
5,"Worth it for the story alone, of course the rest helps.","So what sets this book up to be any different than any other collectible book? ""The Laughlin story"" We came real close to calling this Shakespeare pottery. Just the history and the changing technology is worth reading about.After that is my favorite. ""That Radioactive Red""As the title implies there are sections with stories on Harlequin, Riviera, and Kitchen KraftIn the back there are suggested values and a list of Collector Books for further reading.One major item, the pictures are in color."
5,Very Informative,"Lots of valuable information in this book. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't ant to take a course, but would like to increase their knowledge of their digital SLR camera."
5,Digital Slr Camera for Dummies,"I found the book helpful in mamy ways, but didnot cover, in detail, all of the subjects I thought it would. I needed a book that goes in depth how to set different setting in the manual mode. It covered some subjects that were useful, I needed more information. I will keep the book in my library for future references"
3,Reading,"I am not really a big fan of for dummies books, but my husband is. He has enjoyed it. thanks. Excellent service by the way."
2,Not for Beginners,"A very disappointing and useless book..Please dont waste your money on this book..It will teach you nothing about cameras or photography..This may have been the worst book I ever purchased, double period"
5,Great book,I'm new to dSLR cameras. This book is very helpful and informative. Not to mention great price.One of the best investments I've made.
5,Review for digital Cameras for Dummies,This book was a great bargain. I got a new book for a used book price.
4,"Informative, user-friendly, good value",I think this is a very good book for the money - it teaches you the mechanics of your digital SLR and answers all of the why's and how to's for more effective picture-taking.
2,Not what I expected,TO much comparing point and shoot cameras to SLR. That was not what I bought it for. His other book on NikonsD5000 is all I needed. I wasted my money on this one.
3,"Not for beginners, wastes pages telling you about why dSLRs are better","I recently bought a Canon Rebel XSi and bought this book, hoping it would make life easier. It doesn't! I am new to the dSLR world, but this book spends about 3 chapters telling you why a dSLR is better than a point and shoot. Way too much nonsense info. I did not find this book useful for someone who wants to better understand hwo to get good shots from their camera. If you are a Rebel XSi user, I recently purchased a 3-hour XSi specific training DVD put out by Michael Andrews a professional photographer. It's very good. I believe the site is canonrebelxsidvd dot com."
3,Digital SLR Camers & Photography for Dummies,"I wish you would come out with some DVD's for Dumimies for people like me who are visual learnes more than reading text. Just a suggestion I found on e-bay for &55 that take you from how to charge your battery all the way through the man parts and how to use them, I think that would be a good tool along with the books. Thank you, Kisti Hckam"
3,Justreviewing,Bought this book as a gift but wasn't what the person was looking for so it was returned. A good book to learn about SLR cameras but was looking for something with more information about actual exposure settings.
3,Not what I expected,"It's an okay book but I'm disappointed at lack of usable content. I'm willing to bet that the idiots guide to digital slr cameras would be more informative. Skip this one, you'll be glad you did."
4,Satisfied,"This book is perfect for beginner photographers that are making the leap from a point-and-click camera to a DSLR. The author provided clear and concise explanations that helped me understand how my camera functions and he also provided basic photography concepts. The author came across as modest and added a tad of humor, which made for an enjoyable reading experience. I definitely recommend this book as well as thoroughly reading through your owner's manual and you should be taking great pictures in no time!"
3,"OK for a true beginner, but not detailed enough for those with an artful eye","The book is logically laid out, as are all the Dummies books. Busch certainly prepares a brand-spanking new beginner to the world of SLRs. But if you have the least bit of experience or an artistic bend on how you take your pictures, it's much too simple for you. (I've owned a Nikon 6006 for several yrs & recently finally bought that Nikon D70S.) I still haven't found the book I'm looking for - giving you great technique and composition. The book is just average - keep looking if you're needing more inspiration."
2,I don't know who this book is aimed at.,"I read ""Exposure for Dummies"" and found it very helpful. This book was by a different author but I thought it might be of same quality as the Exposure book. Unfortunately, it's wasn't. Anyone that has ever owned a camera probably already knows the basics that this book has to offer. When the book goes beyond the basics, it merely mentions more advanced features without a helpful explanation of why the photographer might want to use them. And it is repetitive, as if the author had a page requirement to fill. There were a few bright spots, but on the whole, the basics were too basic, and the advanced features, too poorly covered to be of any help to anyone that isn't already familiar with them. There are better books for beginners, and for intermediate photographers, this book has little to offer."
4,Photography,"This is the second edition regarding digiral photography I've purchased. The ""Dummie"" series are great reference tools."
2,couldn't hang,"I got about 100 pages into this amatuerish effort and frankly gave up. Just in case I was wrong about this, I skipped forward a few times, and sure enough, it was more of the same insipid, unimaginative, juvenile writing style. What a disappointment, after 24/7! The characters are so obvious, with such gratuitous identities, that they appear plastic and one dimensional. This was overcome in 24/7 by a fast moving, intelligent plot, but no such luck here. Here, I'm afraid, the lack of substance is glaring. This could have been worth reading, but was apparently rushed in order to take advantage of the success of 24/7. Wouldn't it be nice if agents and publishers gave the muse a little more room."
3,Not what I expected...,"I'm not a big thriller reader, but this book looked really good, and it was...until about 3/4 the way through. At that point it goes from scary to weird. I was very disappointed with the ending of this book. It did not keep up with flow of the whole beginning of the novel. Aside from the end...it was a great page turner. An ok quick read."
1,Book Deserves Zero Stars--Simply Awful!,"_Black Valley_ was easily the worst book I've read in years. I don't know why I stuck with it, but I did finish. Unbelievable, two-dimensional characters with ridiculous, pseudo-scientific explanations--I'm amazed this book ever got published in the first place. Just the fact that garbage like this CAN in fact find a publisher ought to be a ray of hope for all the real writers out there. Terrible, terrible, terrible! Not recommended!"
1,Amateur Writing Effort,"I have not read Jim Brown's previous effort (24/7)...perhaps if I had I would not have spent good money on this book. Black Valley is so full of grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, context errors and malapropisms (example: ""collective conscience"" instead of ""collective conscious"") that I found the book nearly impossible to read. How anyone could compare Jim Brown to Dean Koontz is beyond me. Koontz is a master of the language, whereas Brown could benefit from a remedial English class. If you are even halfway literate, you will not enjoy this book."
3,Mystery or Sci-Fi?,"I enjoyed 24/7 by this author and was looking forward to his second book.I am not sure what to say about ""Black Valley"". I see by the other reviews (most of them anyway) that it was highly enjoyed. My comments are mixed. This book was extremely well written. The suspense was present from the beginning and kept me riveted...until 2/3 into the story. When ""Dr. Dean"" starts figuring out what is happening, I lost interest. The problem: the ending belonged in a science-fiction book. I would have been happy with either a supernatural ending or a ""thriller"" ending, but this story ended up in Robert Heinlein land. I HATE SCIENCE-FICTION, that is why I buy thrillers. I think it was a mistake for the author to do this.So, for me, this one only rates 3 stars."
4,Black Valley ~ Great book!!!,"My dad whom is a fire fighter and a 'tough' guy read the first few chapters and said it was too scary, so I would keep that in mind. I on the other hand read the whole book in 2 days, it was that good. It's a book that will definately keep you on edge but hooks you right from the start. Hope you read and enjoy it, I know I did."
5,Three wonderfully dirty tales,This book starts off with the many sexual adventures of a Russian peasant girl and her transformation from scared virgin to madame of her own house of ill repute. Every sexual fantasy is covered in this and the other tales in this wonderfully erotic book.
1,This book is mislabled,Except for 2 Chapters in the book the bulk talks about areas other than Bipolar illness. This would be good as a dictionary if you wanted a paragraph or two only on something related to different topics that cover mental illnes. It does introduce the novice to wide variety of possible treatments and physical illness that might cause a misdiagnoses of Bipolar illness. Its a good starting point for futher reading.
5,Great Comedy!!,"I loved it. Anyone that lives here can tell you that this stuff really does happen..... Dare anyone to come over the bridge to see...you won't want to leave! Curcuru, keep writing!"
1,sad but true,"When we lack the ability or talent to rise above those around us how do we reconcile ourselves? We may criticize those weakest among us and call it parody. So sad. I would suggest originality next time but then again I'm just anotha' Glousta' native, what do I know."
1,Jerk,"This book is an insult. Curcuru is not only making a joke out of a tragedy, but he's also taking jabs at a wonderful community and its people. If he's smart, he won't show his face in Gloucester again."
1,This book was the reason I stopped being a history major,I can't get any more descriptive than that...it put me to sleep faster than Whitman.
1,A Boring Education,"This book was so slow and boring, I couldn't stand to finish it. Henry Adams was just another modernist author who was unsatisfied with his life in the world of the wealthy elite. I couldn't identify with him at all. He just seemed to be another wealthy stuck up man, at times bored and disturbed by the unfulfilling and superficial life he led. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who's not ready for a long, slow read."
3,Searching for an education,"The Autobiography of Henry Adams details his lifelong search for a useful education. It takes some time to see that Adams is poking fun at himself for how little formal education takes with him. There are certainly some great truths in this book--how what we learn is not always what we start out to study, how the most valuable lessons often come from unexpected sources and even from great failures, how education is truly a lifelong pursuit, and how much of what one would like to know concerning the meaning of life is ultimately unknowable. At the same time, Henry seems to have been overwhelmed by the accomplishments of his ancestors and the autobiography is something of a justification for a life not fully lived. I could not help feeling that had Henry had a real need to work for a living, he might have gotten more out of his education, both formal and otherwise. Some of the events and historical figures that Adams discusses are relatively obscure for a modern audience."
4,Reflective biography of the 19th century,"As the grandson of America's sixth president, John Quincy Adams, and great grandson of America's second president, John Adams, Henry Adams was born to a distinguished New England heritage. His biography recounts the education he received, lamenting the inadequacy of formal schooling in preparing him to live ably during a century of revolutionary technological and philosophical change. Within his comments are wry insights that sometimes draw a smile from the reader, such as his definition of a schoolmaster: ""A man employed to tell lies to little boys."" Adams' views are rather cynical and somewhat fatalistic, but they do reflect the grand changes taking place during his lifetime. I read this book for a lit. class in college, and though most of my classmates found this book a little dull, I found it interesting enough to hold my attention."
3,Correcting erroneous bad review,"I am comparing this Kindle book with a paperback edition published by Houghton Mifflin. I.e., I know what this book is supposed to be like.There appears to have been no attempt to maintain paragraphing. If there was an attempt it is the biggest flop in the history of paragraphing. Large, bold text appears for no reason. Many words are run together. Lines are broken right in the middle of non-hyphenated words. A very, very poor edition. I rate it a 1 star; if there were a zero, I would give it that.June 29, 2011Please disregard my review dated June 24, 2011. It was meant for a different edition. I know nothing about this edition."
3,Henry seems lost in a changing world,"Henry Adams presents himself as a soul caught somewhere between the 18th Century and the 20th, not belonging in either. If you ever wondered how America was transformed from 18th Century idealism to the current political cynicism, this book might add a clue. Be warned, you must first wade through the muck of Adams'18th Century New England pretentiousness. Expect a jaded view of events and figures of the time, especially concerning the Civil War. Still, it does serve to help answer the question, ""What would historical figures like John Adams or Daniel Webster had thought about evolution of American politics."""
2,Henry Adams was a fool.,"That much is evident from the beginning I started out withhigh expectations & was disappointed. I'm glad I listened to the tape rather than try to read it or I would have pitched it early. He was also a bore which explains why he had less of a social life than he wanted & what you'd expect from the grandson of John Quincy Adams. He was neurotic, that being the one of the family traditions he followed. He also had an inferiority complex. For good reason I'd say. For all the advantages he had, the name, a Harvard education, a position as a clerk for his father, in London, during the Civil War & the fact apparently that he didn't have to work very hard... ever, he was basically lazy. History is my avocation. I guess Adams was a historian, & writer. I got nothing from this book & its endless ramblings seem to get worse towards the end. No education."
4,Money Well Spent,"I actually bought this to the frame the monthly movie posters on my wall. No complaints about this product. The paper is shiny, so if you're buying this to use as a calendar, keep in mind that it might be hard to write on."
5,The dope on Craig T.,"Actually, I have quite a few of Craig T's Cd's and I must say....I have not been disappointed by any of them yet. Most are familiar with cd's that have 1 or 2 hits and the rest is the equivalent of fill music. This Artist always seems to have a fresh approach resulting in a creativity comes through in the music. To guyz like this I say...may the force continue to be with you."
2,Not what I expected. Note number of pages. (Paperback Version),"I ordered it expecting it to be the full Gilham's manual. However, it is not. Note the number of pages. It is very misleading how it is set up, and there is NO USEFUL INFORMATION in this 28 page document, besides a table of contents of what you do not have. I am not sure what the intent of this document was but it got my 11.95..."
5,One of the first and one of the best self-help books,"I first read Jo Coudert's fine book in the 1960s, before the onslaught of the self-help books in the 1970s. Coudert's is still one of the clearest, sanest and most easily digestible of the genre. She recounts her own painful struggle as the neglected child of a narcissistic, alcoholic mother, and the devastation it wrought in her later life. Her advice is eminently sensible, practical,--and most important, it works. If you can find it, grab it. It still ranks as one of the best. I'm willing to bet it started a lot of people on the road to healing."
5,A powerful and meaningful exploration of self,I first discovered this masterpiece 8 years ago at a bradshaw workshop. I just pulled it off the shelf and reread it. WOW! I never forgot it but it was nice to be hit with her brillant conceptulizations about being a human being. It is an inspiring piece of work.
3,Good but too verbose,"This is a good book overall, and is generally considered a classic. However, it takes the reader through each deal in excruciating detail. Having said that, I have heard it being said that if you have the patience to go through it a few times(!!), you learn by ""osmosis"", and your game does go up a level. Meanwhile, for us mere mortals, Victor Mollo's ""Card Play Technique"" (also a classic) is much, much better. I have read that book cover-to-cover many times, and still learn every time I read it. Both are classics, but the difference is that Mollo's book reads like a modern well-written textbook, complete with review questions and answers."
4,"A classic, but dry","The Play of the Hand remains one of the definitive books on declarer play and defense. It's a excellent reference and well worth reading if you want to improve your game.Unfortunately wading through it is something of a chore... it's rather dry. Unless you're serious about ""studying"" bridge, this book probably isn't for you. Try ""Card Play Technique"" by Victor Mollo -- it's equally thorough, covers many of the same topics and is written in wonderfully engaging and humorous prose."
1,Out of Date,"This is an old out of touch and out of date book. Probably a good book in its day, but not a modern bridge book. Work well for someone who wants to play bridge like an very old party bridge style. Not for anyone who wants to be a good bridge player."
5,Terrific,i am a real beginner but this book is really answering the doubts that arose in me playing hand after hand. it is very clear and exactly what i needed !
5,a masterpiece,"Easy to read, well organized, this masterpiece needs to be studied carefully, a must have for any serious player!"
4,Runs a little big,"I recently purchased this item and I'm satisfied. In case you're in doubt, it's my opinion that this brand runs just a tad big, so order down."
3,Very interesting historical account,"This is a very interesting historical account of early life in Choestoe, GA as written by a local who grew up here. He tells history of area as told to him by locals while he grew up as well as what he lived. Interspersed with tales about early Indian life in area and Trail of Tears drive to ""rid mountains"" of Cherokees"". Very good reading for those who know the area."
5,An excellent guide,"It's an excellent book which will help you to keep in touch with the correct english grammar. If you aren't a native english speaker and you want to learn english language , don't worry!!! this book is going to help you with your studies, it is going to clear any grammar misunderstanding.This could be considered as an english handbook. And if you are a native english grammar you could use this book too, because sometimes you might need to clear some grammar rules tospeak ""your best english"".Don't lose the opportunity of reading this book."
5,World's best English grammar book !,"I use this book with all of my ESL students ! They can work straight through the workbook, or as I discover their grammarproblems, we can immediately go to that page and solve that problem ! There's a page of rules for each piece of grammar, and then a worksheet page next to it. The worksheet vocabulary is everyday and easy, so the student can focus on the grammarpoint. I've tried other books through the years, but this book always comes out on top."
1,RIP OFF,"The key should be together with the book, at the end, as usual. Shame on you, Cambridge and Author."
1,Should I like this??,"The only thing that impressed me was the speed to prepare---the so-called brownie was like a piece of kids chocolate cake with the choco syrup--you can do better at the Little Debbie shelf at the local supermaket. The price was absurd if it was on a half price discount and then I would be looking for an ice cream coupon. Sorry folks, not worth the money ."
3,Okay in a pinch....,"I ordered these because of their great price on amazon at the time. I think they are okay, but the suggested cooking time is too long (I cook them 5-10 seconds less than recommended) and they do seem to have a 'chemically/processed' taste to them. Also, I really don't like heating/microwaving plastic, as the bowls are made of. Good in a pinch if you're craving a molten chocolate type dessert, but I wouldn't buy more than one at a time again."
5,Great book for any runner,"I recently purchased this book for a friend and decided to get out my old copy to read again.I forgot what a wealth of information it has. Everything from stretching to gear to training plans plus wonderful short articles by actual runners. It also has information specific to women's health and pregnancy.If you are just starting out or don't consider yourself a runner, this book will inspire you. If you have been running for a while, this book can help you improve your PR or keep you motivated.It has inspired me to get serious about running again and am looking forward to my first half-marathon later this year."
2,running,Starts off with some good tips but nothing that you can't research and find on the internet.
5,Awesome!,"I love this book -- It has become my bible! I read the book in less than a week, I could hardly put it down. When I first got the book, I thought it might be over my head (even though I've been running for years!), but I found that everything was explained well and every option was laid out for me to see. I would recommend this book for everyone -- people who want to get into shape to people who want to train and to people like me, who just run to run!"
3,Common sense for $25,"A very good, motivational book, but it wont deliver any new information you dont already know. The book delivers some insight on how to begin a running regime, but nothing earthshattering. It tells you to start slow and condition, eat right and enjoy yourself. Good book if you need that little extra encouragement, but my advice: save the money for some good running shoes."
3,Pretty Useful,"This book is pretty good, but there's some stuff in there that I think could use a bit more detail. I noticed some information that I consider important that is missing from the book. Overall, it's pretty good, but could use an update."
5,keep returning to this book,"I needed to buy a replacement book for the library after my puppy crewed on a running book I had checkedout. This is the one I selected form Amazon. Of cource I read it before handing it over and loved it, so I ordered myself another copy. I have since bought a copy for all my running girlfriends. I fing the book motivating. By following most of the advice and helpful ideas, I completed a several half Marathon races and am currently training for the full Marathon."
4,A classic -- for beginners,Good book aimed more at the beginner runner. You can also tell this was not recently written and is not completely current. Still it's a classic and does the job as such.
3,"Meh, it's Ok",This book is pretty informative but if you've been running for a while and have googled most of your info already then you should take a pass at this. I don't know that I would even recommend it for a former runner looking to get back into it since most of this you'll either already know or it's not worth buying when you can just search the web.However if you are a new runner/jogger (or even walker) or are looking to start this is the perfect book. There's alot that you should know when starting out and this book is a good place to start.
5,Wonderful experience,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway!"
4,Smooth Jazz with a Bounce,I had never heard of Tom Braxton before this CD and boy was I pleasantly surprised. This is definitely a nice album to listen to.
3,Marketing blunder,"I bought these for my son, since I think they are really cool. I myself am just getting into golfing and am fairly unknowledgeable about golf gear. But after I bought these, I thought to myself ""Why would you make green golf balls for the golf course? You'll never be able to find them!""Oh well, he'll use them for awhile, and then the novelty of them will disappear.Live and learn. It must be a marketing nightmare for the company that produced them."
4,Legends in the Making,"I saw these guys in San Francisco, and they were awesome. If you like Frank Zappa and the Mothers you will dig the sense of humor these guys have ....a must buy"
4,These guys are nothing if not eclectic.,"These guys are all over the place stylistically--a testament to their versatile musicianship. Some tracks are put together like sound collages; others are grooving dance tunes. In any event, they put on a high-energy live show--highly recommended if you're hanging out in northern New Mexico any time soon. Santa Fe locals will find plenty of familiar references."
3,Mike Johnson returns with a heavier sound,"It's been a few years since the release of I Feel Alright an album of haunting slow songs and I Feel Alright an album of country like ballads so what's new with Mike Johnson with this release?He still has the smooth understated vocals,still has dark lyrics(there'll never be a happy pop song from this guy)but in an interesting change the backup band has a loud snarling sound that gives the songs more energy this time around.Still the best song is the quieter If The World Hadn't Gone Insane and sometimes the noise can overwhelm Johnson's voice but it's nice to see Johnson evolve throughout the years trying different styles.Thundering bleakness from one of the best undiscovered artists out there today."
3,Primal Scream's cream?,"I like Primal Scream, but even I have to admit that some of the tracks on this 'greatest hits' cd are a little poor. That said for the money you get all the good stuff which out weighs all the mirginal stuff.So if you like music that falls somwhere between Brit pop, electro, dance and rock then give this a whirl in your cd player!"
3,Tell Them I am Coming,"Not a book I would recommend, the content is questionable. For a true Christian, you need to realize that one cannot rely on another person's experience when trying to comprehend the afterlife."
1,Dr Eby's prophecy did not come to pass...,"Well, at least my prophecy came to pass. I prophesied that Dr Eby was another false prophet. I was correct. Dr Eby got all the hype by stating he would not die before the rapture occured. Well, he's dead and no rapture. Many hardcore Eby-followers claim that he was the modern-day Methuselah, and after his death the rapture would occur. Well, two years have passed and no rapture. Is the rapture coming soon? I think so, but dont believe some date-setting false prophet for an exact time as it is not for us to know the times or seasons.Go to this website if you want to see how hard core Eby followers are calling dr Eby ""Methuselah"" out of their own mouths because they love not the truth.http://www.geocities.com/bramlett2000/dreby.html"
5,"Fantastic, but not for the faint-hearted","I just finished reading ""Death Trance,"" and I have to agree with the three other reviews already posted--this book is one heck of a thrill ride.I read a lot of horror fiction--some of it's OK, some of it can be pretty lame, but sometimes a book sticks out and really draws me in. ""Death Trance"" is one of those books.While not giving any of the story line away, I will say that those who are faint-hearted may wish to avoid this book because of the extreme violence depicted toward the beginning. However, if you can make it through those gruesome scenes, ""Death Trance"" is far more tame on the ""gross-out"" factor than other Masterton books out there.For those of you who like crime novels and are looking for something a little different, you may wish to check this book out--it has a mystery, a very twisted criminal conspiracy, and more. Enjoy!"
2,Is this America?,We received these switches in a timely manner but the power cord is not for the United States!! It is a foreign plug and does us no good without a plug we can use in OUR country!!
1,Scarey,Ordered for disabled family member and I never gave it to her - too dangerous looking - they should discontinue this model. Sorry!
5,Loved it!,This was a great holiday movie with heartwarming charm. The main actors were great. It's great to see Jennifer Love Hewitt when she was young. You can see what great actress she was even then.
4,(Jennifer) Love Hewitt Is Great in this flick!,A must see for Jennifer Love Hewitt fans! She was known as Love Hewitt in this flick before she was made famous. A fair event for everyone to enjoy. I loved this flick when I seen it back in 1995. You'll enjoy this flick if you are a Jennifer Love Hewitt fan!
5,Not the same Zack de la Rocha you're used to...but still awesome nonetheless,"Before Zack de la Rocha conked heads with Tom Morello and created one of the greatest bands of all time, he was the frontman of a small hardcore band in California. They only released one studio record, and EP, and this is it.This record crackles with intensity, right from the very first track. Zack's voice is not the same smooth rapper you year on RATM's stuff; here he goes all out and screams, yells, and even sings. The band is great is well, with a great guitar player though not quite as amazing as Tom Morello. Be warned though: this may be too intense for people not used to hardcore punk. But for a guy like me, I love it.If you liked this, check out ""Live At The Anthrax"", the only other record Inside Out released."
2,Not very good,Not a great disc. No melody. Zach dosen't sound like the Zach we know. 15 minutes long. Buy it if you want everything to do with rage.
4,Pure Punk from ZDLR,"If this CD had the sound quality of the Rage releases it would be another instant classic from Zack. He would have been just fine if he'd dedicated his career pursuits to punk. It would be cool if he someday chooses to re-record it. The sound is kind of crappy for my tastes, but I expected that considering small-label release in the early-mid-90s."
3,good for fans of hardcore punk but don't expect RATM,"I remember being very excitied to find another album featuring the lyrics and vocals of Zack, especially as I'm a huge Rage fan but I was dissapointed with this album. Now I wasn't expecting rap but was expecting to hear his vocals delivered as clearly and distinctively as his Rage stuff. This is not the case in my opinion. This is a typical hardcore album with hardcore style vocals to the point that I wasn't sure if this was even Zack.However forgetting that dissapointment and looking at the album and music for what it is, it's a good hardcore punk album with intelligent lyrics. I'm not a huge hardcore fan but don't mind some of it and this isn't bad. But being a Rage fan, having this album in my collection goes without saying. Definitely for Zack fans and hardcore punk fans."
2,"Cool for RATM collectors, not that great otherwise","It is cool to have an early CD featuring Zac Del La Rocha of Rage Against The Machine, but the songs on here are just ok. Zach only screams the whole time, so that means no rapping. The music is basic, and does not blow me away either. Anyway, it is cool to have his early CD though."
2,too much $ even for a free book!,"I agree with the previous reviewer. interesting book but the author's thesis is layed out, in great detail, in the long inroduction. Would have been more generous with the stars if it had illustations. I was greatly dissapointed with this because they are a necessary element in the analysis of the subject."
2,An American Family in Australia,"As an autobiography ""Walkabout Yours"" is a very good book, giving a slice of the life of Pickering family. As a travel book, it is very disappointing since Pickering is too involved in himself to describe parts of Australia. One can only find glimpses of information about Australia scattered among the daily concerns of Pickering family. Where you expect to find descriptions of Australian people, you find how much Samuel Pickering paid for his breakfast ($13.50), how much gas costs (76.5 cents) and other trivialities of daily life. Samuel Pickering is too absorbed with himself to describe Australia. Although Pickering's writing style is fluid and witty, the lack of observation of his surroundings makes this book a boring travel book"
1,A Waste of Time,"I had a different kind of computer vacuum that worked well. I loan it out and it was never returned, so I wanted to buy another and this one looked great and so I ordered it. Unfortunately it doesn't work at all when we connected to the USB port and unfortunately it doesn't take any batteries like my old one. What a waste of money! Was it tested at all before leaving the factory? Probably not!"
4,"More music, less comedy, still enjoyable","Like its predecessors, this video is a blend of musical performances and some of the biggest names in British comedy. While there is more emphasis on the musical performances this time around, there is still plenty of funny stuff. Particularly funny is the backhanded ""tribute"" to John Cleese, who was instrumental in getting the series started. Another one to look for is the ""shrubbery"" sketch, in which the performers can't seem to get their lines straight."
4,Quick Read-But Very Informative,"I found this book to be very interesting and a fun read. Very quick reading. If you are a Nostra fan, this is the book for you......whether you believe any of it, I guess is up to you."
2,Jazz babies would fall asleep,"New versions of Porgy and Bess are rare on CD, and for almost two decades the ultra-complete set under Simon Rattle (EMI) has dominated the field. It's been waiting for an American production to challenge it, but Mauceri's new set isn't it. For one thing, the conductor is woefully flat and foursquare in his rhythms--it's embarrassing to hear the jazz drained out of every number.The two principals, Alvy Powell and Marquita Lister, are decent, but both have wobbly voices under pressure and a tendency to tip-toe through their most famous numbers, as if passion is too vulgar ('Bess, you is my woman now' is especially lifeless). The performers in general seem uncertain about how to play the dated Catfish Row denizens, so we hear every kind of accent from Sportin' Life's blackface caricature to Bess's hoity-toity opera vowels. The selling point that this is ""how Gershwin himself would have done it"" might carry more weight if the performance itself wasn't so lackluster."
1,Jeff Grumman,"Frankly, I thought far too much chapter space was given to the 'dead aligator in the shower room' business; desperation set in here. Happy to sell the book on, though."
2,Didn't notice a difference in my lawn,"This took forever to ship out, and when it got here, i used it. Works great in any kind of spreader, as the little pellets aren't too big, but I just didn't notice a change in my lawn at all. Didn't harm, didn't help. I'm in Central Virginia."
4,Cheap but does the job,I would not call this a bulletproof product as it appears cheaply made but it does the job well. I am using it to power a camcorder on a motorcycle.
3,Avoid if Running Windows XP (Any version),This program works ok most of the time on versions ofWindows prior to XP. With XP Home SP2 the program willnot run at all reporting Runtime Error 9. If there isany support for Click'N Burn I have not been able tofind it using Google searches. I.E. buy and you are onyour own.
4,Great for the price,"I went for this speaker system after looking at lots of others. Overall I am very happy with this item. Sounds good, easy to use, lightweight. My only complaint is that the clip for the nano will not fit. The nano will fit in the clip, but the nano will not attach to the plug with the clip on it. The nano is secure for the most part, but if you plan on doing a lot of traveling with the speakers you should procede with caution. If you are looking for good sound and a good price, then this is it."
3,iPod Audio System,"This is the 2nd unit I purchased, First was chewed by dog. This unit didnt have the quality feel like the other one did, felt like cheaper, lighter weight materials, thus sounds was not AS good as the first. Still the best iPod music system for the price. Simple to use and compact. Still recommend it!"
1,Did not charge my Ipod Touch 8G,"Although this unit was advertised as having ""docking and charging for all Ipods"", my iPod Touch 8G did not charge with this unit. It's difficult to control the iPod when the ""docking cradle"" is in place because it obstructs the touch screen. The sound quality is just OK."
4,Good angst in a tense visionary,"Role switching in book in which the male lea finds himself in traditionally woman's role: abandoned, uncertain, insecure."
2,Most irritating book I have ever read,"The author tempts us with his rich language into burrowing into a story which he has not seen fit to finish. He allows his publicists to speak of the book as a ""thriller"", where no plot has been fleshed out and no character fully developed. I felt totally cheated by this book."
2,The Riders,"I bought this book because a favorite author of mine recommended it. I found it very dark, and frustrating. The scenery was grim and it left me depressed."
2,A Story With No Ending,"What the hell?! Just finished this ""novel"" and after 375 pages of setting the scene, I almost threw the book across the room. Yes, it is beautifully, achingly rendered. Every aspect is richly detailed and serves to draw you in and keep the pages turning. However, it feels like only half a story; like the author couldn't imagine a resolution that would satisfy, so he just gave up. The reader gets nothing. I understand that in real life people go missing and aren't ever found, but this was clearly a staged disappearance on Jennifer's part, and we never have an inkling of how or why. I know this is meant to be an examination of a downward spiralling psyche, and so it is. But without the rest of the story, it's just a lot of pretty phrases. Extremely disappointing."
3,Riveting but an enormous letdown.,"The first time I read this I was angry with Winton for leaving us up in the air: the book was un-put-downable but too much is left unexplained and unresolved. The second time round I was angry with Scully for his dogged stupidity in failing to accept that his wife has left him and their daughter. Thirdly, who on earth are the riders and what on earth do they signify? I usually enjoy Winton but this really is too much. I would like him to stand up and explain himself."
4,"Who are the Riders, really?","I really enjoyed this book for several different reasons. First, I found Scully to be a likable character, though some of his choices were rather unlikable. He seems to genuinely love his wife and daughter and his devotion to them is endearing. His daughter, Billie, is one of the more interesting seven-year-old characters I've encountered and I did struggle a bit with the fact that she was only seven. So mature for her age! Pete-the-Post is another endearing character that, had the book taken a different turn, I would have loved to know more about. But this book isn't about Pete or his brother or any of the other secondary characters. This book isn't even about the missing wife. I found this book to be about anticipation, about waiting for something that may never appear, whatever that is."
1,Good but precious writing yields depressing empty story,"This is the story of a good but simple man whose wife is supposed to join him with their 7 year old daughter in the new home which he has rebuilt in Ireland. When the dazed daughter shows up without his wife, he starts a frantic, disorganized and eventually drunken search for her all over Europe. We watch the rapid descent of the hero into a state in which his 7 year old provides the only direction and stability of his life. He is only barely believable as a character and his daughter is even less credible. The writing is rich and often elegant but contains too much material that I would have considered daring as a teenage in the 60's but now seems trite. The story does not really develop, it just ends. Perhaps some would consider this book avant-garde but I just thought it bad."
1,Seven Pounds in book form,"The literary equivalent of the film 'Seven Pounds' - i.e. seemingly highly rated by people who are meant to know better, but making little sense. I completed both to the end hoping there to be some eventual redemption, but it was sorely lacking in both cases.Why was this so-named (ditto the film) and what was the point of it? Impossible coincidences .. just like Seven Pounds .... how could he not extract any information from Billie about the separation ... finding it easier to trek across Europe for fear of disturbing her in some way. How old was Billie? - 7 and a half going on 20, judging by her later behaviour. Why did he believe this Irma character had met his wife .. how did she just happen to catch up with him ... some countries distant?Chapter 32 , keh? etc, etc"
3,the good the bad (and the mystery),"I am not at all surprised by the wildly different customer responses to this novel, because my own response to it was mixed. I found the writing dense and surprising and beautiful. I loved the first section (in Ireland). The second section (in Greece) tested my affection for the narrator as well as my ability to suspend my disbelief and follow these two characters across Europe. At times, the daughter's silence (and the father's unwillingness to test it) seemed more like a plot device than a believable human response. Despite these criticisms, I was still pulled into the beauty of the language and the dark search for the missing wife. All in all, it was one of the strangest books I've ever read. It was kind of like a darker version IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS. I read it for the book club I'm in. We meet next Thursday, and I'll be interested to hear the others' reactions and to discuss the things in the book which still remain a mystery to me."
5,"A compelling book, but one that left me puzzled...","Winton is clearly an outstanding writer. I could not put this book down, and yet I continually felt a little at sea, wishing someone would explain to me what was going on. The book is written with such passion that the reader enters into a kind of situational madness, in which she or he descends with the protagonist, Scully, into the emotionally-charged confusion brought about when his wife disappears. Apparently she has abandoned him and their child, but why, and for what? Scully chases around Europe with their child as he tries to find his wife and the answers to these questions. I only wish Winton had cleared up more of the mystery."
4,engaging,"This book is one that just rattles around in your mind when you are not reading it and for days after you finish it. It was wonderfully written, an engaging story, and had real characters."
4,Confusing conclusion,"I was gripped by this book. Tim Winton's prose is electric. But the plot proliferates into something unbelievable. Yet I felt frustration, not at the author, but with myself for not being able to clearly see the truth. Perhaps like the protagonist I was searching for the reality of the story. It posed more questions and answered few. I came away feeling a bit like I'd been served a delicious appetizer, wine, vegetables, but no entree. And I'm still hungry."
2,a very exhausting reading experience,"I guess I should start by saying that I really didn't like this book very much and would be hard put to recommend it --it had its moments but I found it very exhausting and not a very compelling or satisfying read -- I liked the Ireland part of the book but then it wen totally off course, for me, and I thought th author was totally out of control... I had lots of questions about the various plot ""tiwsts"" and characters --particualry when Scully and Billie were on aGreek island but ultimately I just wanted to finish it and move on to soemthing that would more satisfying and enjoyable."
2,Its okay,"The item in question is not appealing to the eye. There are different pieces to the set up and they are all different colors, white, black, silver, etc and when you place it against the door it sticks out like a sore thumb. Additionally, the directions want ask you to drill into the glass door and do not provide the proper hardware to do so."
1,Beware of Fundamentalist Christian slant!,"Anyone with half a brain will see this video for the heavily biased, right-wing nonsense that it is. The content is almost entirely based on hearsay, uses logical fallacies, and makes allegations that aren't corroborated by evidence.Interestingly enough, further investigation reveals that this farce was produced by ""New Liberty Videos."" This company is a Christian video retailer whose slogan reads: ""N L V cutting edge documentaries change lives now and for eternity."" Perhaps a more honest slogan would be: ""We produce videos to brainwash easily manipulated people and maintain conservative political power.""Those who claim this sleaze is in any way ""informative and objective"" need to stop watching the CBN and Fox News, take a course in Logic 101, and perhaps by some miracle attain critical thinking skills.Waste your cash, and your time, at your own risk! I cringe rating this with one star, because it doesn't even deserve that."
1,HORRIBLE -- AN INSULT TO INTELLIGENCE,"The title of this DVD is so misleading and an insult to my wallet. Even the picture on the case is the same as on President Clintons='s autobiography. Shame on the people who distributed this DVD -- I guess the far right has figured out another way of taking. I thought about sending it back to the Amazon seller but then another good person will be fooled into buying it, so I will simply destroy it!"
1,Worst documentary ever,This was the worst documentary I have ever seen. The only word I can think of is propaganda propaganda propaganda. They offered no real facts or hard evidence to support any of their harsh claims against Bill Clinton. I do not recommend this dvd.
1,Uninteresting Propaganda,"I don't think this qualifies as a documentary. It is pure anti-Clinton propaganda. I was surprised that something could be so poorly done today. I bought it because the cover and title was almost the same as ""Bill Clinton My Life."" I believe that was the intent and the only way any of these could have been sold. By the way Amazon mistakedly has the book cover of ""Bill Clinton My Life"" with its listing. (I would rate it no stars.)"
1,A New Low Point in Muckraking,"Just when you think you've seen it all... a new low point in muckraking comes along! This DVD is pure kitty litter -- but will obviously appeal to fans of Limbaugh, Hannity, Beck, O'Reilly and the rest of the lunatic fringe. The DVD invents charges and baseless claims that are so unbelievable it's amazing any thinking person would find them credible.Despite the ""all Monica all the time"" scandal, America too quickly forgot that Clinton's eight years in office was the greatest economic growth period in our history. He left office with a $5 trillion budget surplus -- only to have Bush/Cheney turn it into a $10 trillion deficit. In time, history will praise Clinton and finally relegate Bush to the most incompetent and misguided administration in this nation's history. Sadly, this DVD will not contribute to that legacy."
2,Not for a beginner,"Not enough detail info or ""example"" pictures to please me. When one is just ""breaking in"" to designing more before/after pics would help."
2,If you've seen the show....,You don't need to read the book. There wasn't anything new or insightful to be garnered from reading the book. I was hoping for some more in depth tips that the show doesn't have time to cover.
3,"Change ""other views""","Before I bought the book, I read the reviews, but what really got me interested was the ""other views"" or pages from the book below the book title, you know the ones that you look at to get a better idea what's in the book. Well it shows a page with ""glazed cabinets"" but there is no such page in the actual book. I was really disappointed just because I expected it to be there if it was right below the book."
1,Not Practical,"If you have the luxury of stagging your home for resale as they do on the show, this book may help expedite the sell of your home.I am not convinced that stagging equals the immediate sale of your home. If it were that easy, there would not be such a heavy inventory of homes for resale.The book does have some nice decorating ideas, just don't count on them to sell your home."
5,Changes That Pay Off,"I wish Designed to Sell had been around when I sold my last house. They have simple and usually not-too-expensive ways to show a house at its best. Many of the tips apply equally well to a house you don't plan to sell.The ideas for painting, small remodeling projects, and furniture rearrangement spark ideas for pepping up any house. Why wait until time to sell to make these improvements? Enjoy them now while you are in your house.The book includes a lot of things that I like in the show, but it's hard to get the panaramic views of the rooms into a book. The before and after pictures don't show as well on a page. Otherwise, the book was inspiring and the rooms look inviting."
4,Great Resource,Designed to Sell is a well written book with helpful tips and photo comparisons from the Designed To Sell program. Lisa Laporta has a wonderful sense of style on a budget. I'll look forward to a possible sequel to this book.
4,Much more informative than I thought it would be...,"I was expecting this to possibly be a picture book full of before/after shots. Instead, it's much meatier than I was expecting. So far, so good."
2,"Long on words, short on before and after photos","This book was a disappoint for me. I was looking for ideas and wanted to see before and after photos. There was too much description. We all know the basics of staging to show, so we wanted real demonstrations. If you have watched the series, you don't need the book."
2,mediocre,This book is OK for the price but it ONLY has some of the designs of the shows with Lisa LaPorta. does not have any of the other designers rooms in it. there is references in the back for the items/paint used though.
5,Pictures speak a thousand words!,"Great pictures and the suggestions are truly helpful. I don't know how they get the furniture they use for so cheap but the ideas they use are great. If you are interested in Staging your home to sell it faster, this is one book I do recommend."
4,"A Great Book, what became of the Author?","I have never seen a Charles Harness book retail in theUK. I picked this one up by accident in a 'Jumble Sale'as we say here in England. One of the best single SFnovels in my opinion, up there with Asimov's Foundationor Herbert's Dune. Tightly written, imaginative, realisticdialogue, gripping. Elements of a detective story/thrillerwith the SF side of it a highly competent backdrop. In someways it's one of those future-society what-ifs and makesa unique contribution as such.Seems he only wrote one other, The Rose, not quite as goodI would say. If there are any other titles, let me know!Nigel, England."
2,NOT AS EXPLAINED,"In reading the description, I was expecting that it would guide a child in writing their own book. NOT SO. It just has a story written out, and blanks for the child to fill in. It is NOT their own book. My daughter, who is 9 years old, is very much into writing and has written many chapters of her own imagination. I thought this product was going to help her fine-tune it and guide her along proper techniques and examples of how to perfect her writing into a book that she can be ready to publish. So, beware. This program is already a story written, just fill in the blanks."
5,SO much fun -- and a book to keep forever!,"I am a teacher of 3rd and 4th graders and love this product. The students have a great time creating their books -- they love that they can make their own choices, using their own names, friends and family, pets, etc. -- and the stories are more personal and fun than any other book they have.To get to print the stories and have them professionally bound is such a treat. We can make a group book and then save it in the classroom for all future classes to read.The kids also want to make their own books to give to their grandparents for the holidays.As their teacher, my favorite part is that they learn so much more vocabulary along the way. It's just such fun and the kids are really being immersed in a total reading and writing environment. Highly recommended!!"
1,Disappointing!,"As my daughter enjoys reading and writing stories, I thought this program would be fun. But to my disappointment, she didn't like it, as all it was is a fill in the blank program, and the program writes the story for you."
1,Don't Bbuy!!!,"Books by You no longer works. Knowledge Adventure says they were sued and can no longer sell it themselves. If you make and then try to publish a book, it won't work. It was once a great product, but now it's worthless."
4,Catchy funk house with some good highs,"Unlike the disaster that is Rivera's ""first"" cd, this is actually a mixed CD where the tracks blend together seamlessly. While it's mostly non-vocal, there are some diva samples here and there to break up the long stretches of instrumental stuff. Track times:1. loneliness (5:57)2. Vertigo (5:25)3. Funk a tron (6:27)4. Amazing (5:07)5. Funk is funking up my mind (7:21)6. Do you like to funk (6:23)7. Insanity (6:34)8. I can't sleep (5:53)9. The hum melody (5:38)10. Let your body rock (6:43)11. Addicted to you (4:10)12. feel this (6:58)"
4,Good gel - cheap,"I have been using this gel for years now. I used to use DEP, but they changed their formula or something and I just couldn't find the right level. I switched to LA Looks to try and have used it since. It is a little sticky when you are first applying it (though aren't most gels). It works great to help me style very straight and obstinate hair. My hair remains soft and you can't feel the gel in it at all. My only complaint is it's recently become hard to find this level. Hope I don't have to switch again."
4,Very nice fantasy -- very real.,"I've read many changeling books, but don't let the title deceive you, it's actually quite brilliantly written. Romantic, magical, enthralling. A must for fantasy readers"
3,Interesting but chilly read,"I wanted to like The Woman Who Loved Reindeer, but the emotional tone of the book is as cold as the tundra where it's set. The heroine, Caribou, is a resourceful and realistic young woman, her interactions with her neighbors are believable, her turmoil over her relationship with her supernatural fosterling is clearly depicted -- and yet, I couldn't bring myself to care about her very much. Only at the very end of the book did I find myself involved at all.It's well-written, well-constructed and apparently well-researched, but to my mind, it lacks heart."
5,THE BEST!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read (just under Tamora Peirce's books). I read it a while ago, when i was in 5th or 6th grade. Even then i loved it, although it had some parts that i couldn't understand. I read it again recently, and i STILL LOVE IT! you know that a book is awesome if you read it once and then again, a long time later. That means that the book is truly awesome! It is about a girl who falls in love. The one she is in love with, however, is not really human. There is a great story-line, and it all fits together eventually. It is great, and i recommend it to anyone over the age of 11 that is mature. IT RULES!"
5,Education Overview,The book arrived in great shape and on time. It is an overview of American public schooling and an important statement about the way we got to where we are today.
2,Infuriating,"It's hard to have much confidence in a book that is so obviously slanted toward a particular agenda. For example, in the discussion of tracking, Spring cites one study that found ""few benefits"" of tracking, but makes no mention of other studies that found benefits to students of various levels (Loveless, 1999; Epstein & MacIver, 1992). This is political correctness with a vengeance, and I would not rely on this biased and polemical book to become informed about the issues."
5,American Education,I used this book for my course; American Education for International Students. The book explain well the American Education in a more balanced way. I love it!
1,jj fad should sue,of all songs fergie can cover she chose this one eazy should haunt this freak from beyond the grave anyway this song sucks and she even talks in tounges like baby d did at the song's climax I prefer jj fad anyday.
1,"Not equipped with ferrites, as per the picture... and title.","The cords are fine, work fine, but don't have the ferrite cores on the ends. Just plain not there. For less than a buck each, they work fine. But I wanted the cores, and it seems I'm doing without. Any suggestions appreciated."
2,Can get a display to anything that just runs 720p at low refresh rate,I got these on sale and had hoped they would power a 1080p computer monitor but when I connected the cord and PC up I got a cable error on my monitor. It was then that I swapped out this cable for a higher end cable capable of high bandwidth and was able to get a display. These were really cheap but could not do the job for me. I am sure if you have a plain 720p tv it will work just fine though.
5,Good cable at a low cost.,"Used this HDMI cable to connect my new DVD VHS player/recorder to my Sony Bravia LCD TV. Works great! Previously had it connected with a HDMI cable costing much more, but didn't notice any difference in picture quality after switching to this lower cost cable."
5,Excellent Reference Even for Non-Sales Managers,"I am presently rewiting corporate policy for a Information Technology (IT) firm and find this guide an excellent tool in learning (designing) the ""sales"" process. It is very well written and I especially appreciate the fact that I don't have to wade through reams of narrative to get at the ""meat"". The tables are priceless. I'm sending copies to our VP of Sales and COO as part of our restructuring. You can't do any better than this for executive ""brevity""."
2,biases and out-there,"I agree with many libertarian ideas but this book is not very good. Poorly written, narrow in perspective, and without much traction in the field--this book is not worth the time. Read Thomas Sowell instead."
1,The introduction was a failure,"Arthur Seldon uses Abraham Lincoln as an example of a leader who believed in limited government, ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"". In actuality, Lincoln lead a failed government attempt at state railroad building when he was in the Illinois legislature. He instituted the first conscription in the United States, and the first income tax. He lead the charge of an unconstitutional export tax on Southern cotton and then an actual blockade. He intimidated the Supreme Court and executed Union soldiers for sleeping on duty. Seldon should do a bit of reading about Lincoln before he uses him as an icon for small government. I, personally, was so turned off by the introduction that I couldn't bring myself to read the book."
4,"All the music, but you need a magnifying glass to read it!","This is the definitive book of Beatles songs, but unfortunately the size of the lyrics, notes, etc. is just too small. I ended up copying at 150% any songs that I really want to play on the piano. But this is THE book. Get it!"
2,Incomplete Beatles,All the songs are included.Vocals: incomplete. There is no backing vocals transcriptions.Guitar: only the chords. No solo.Piano: only a very simple arrangement.
1,What has happened to phone CD's!?,The quality of this publishers product line has declined dramatically. The Pro CD and Info USA line used to be invaluable to our firm and the previously easy to use database marketing tools now have limits and features rendering them essentially useless. Info USA's 2001 YellowPages main menu is now a clunking wanna-be web browser designed to push users to their web site rather than aid consumers in using the data contained on the CD; the one purchased! Anyone with info on another publishers product please let me know asap c/o ExAir@GTE.net
1,BEWARE OF THIS ONE!,You can only access 1000 records and then you have to pay more to get more. This is a terrible rip-off. Feel free to contact me on e-mail and I will tell you more. Just don't buy it and you will be happy. This is not the good stuff they had two years ago!
1,select phone 2000,"This program is a good program for researching phone numbers by category or just a listing with one big exception. You are limited by the number of time you can use it. No one tells you this, it just suddenly don't work. Forcing you to call USA info, then being told you will have to pay for additional usage.They will allow you limited usage free but, you'll soon ran out of that, then you PAY!"
1,Buyer Beware - An expensive telephone book,"SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY--Do not purchase this software unless you ONLY want to use it for reference. If you intend to use it to print mailing labels, or even to print any type of list, you are only allowed to print 1,000 names, then you will be forced to purchase additional names @ 10 cents per name; or as was quoted to me I could purchase 25,000 names for $1,000. If I had wanted to spend $1,000 for mailing labels, I wouldn't have paid $65 for this software."
4,Tile Rummy or Rummikub,"The item was delivered quickly in excellent condition. The carrying case is nice and the tiles are sturdy. The boards that hold the tiles are plastic and over time may crack or break. The instructions that come with the set are quite funny--they encourage you to contact the company with suggestions, yet there is nothing on the instructions or anywhere on the game to indicate who makes the game or how to contact them. Cheers! The game is great fun and quite addicting. Even though it says it is for ages 10+ kids 7+ seem to enjoy it and are as good as some adults."
3,This set is overpriced for its low quality,"This is a a great game, fun to play! However, I would get the cheaper set as this set is cheap but w/ an expensive price tag. Toy-R-Us has the same game called RAMI-O that you can order online for less than $[...]. This is the same set as the $[...] game and it was $[...]."
1,MNReview,"Story was great -- but the reader, very poor. Reader tried to imitate voices - making the characters come off very goofy and irrating. A consistant voice telling the story would be strongly preferred."
3,Distracting voices,"The book was good, but the male voices were too ridiculous. They were a distraction from the story. You can either get annoyed by them, or they are amusing. Either way, I think it would have been better for her to read it with a consistent voice."
4,Don't judge a books by its cover :),"This book has to be the very first Nancy Drew book that i ever read. True it may not be as exciting as her other books and the drama may not be so convinving. But if you think about it, what Nancy went through in the older versions of these books was a lot for people ""way back in those times"" I recommend this book for any young, middle aged, or older aged reader. Happy reading!"
1,Cheap knock-off import item,Don't waste your money on these sheets and cases. I have and am sorry. I have a top of the line Maytag Neptune but the sheets and cases did not perform well even through the gentle product wash. The stitching is sweat shop quality with the seams and stitch spacing inferior at best. The weft and weave are not cut right so that the items naturally shrink at different rates and directions. I use mine for cleaning rags after just two washings. Save yourselves and just pass this one by!!!!
2,Horrible,The sheets feel like Sand-Paper after the first wash and the pillowcases don't fit any size pillow as they are cut incorrectly. The Joseph Aboudd sheets I purchased are much better than these but now the are $50 vs. $40 when I purchased
1,Just fine untill washed!,"Nice & soft but...begining with the first washinng the color started fading out in spots & blotches. It looks like the sheets & pillow cases were splashed with bleach, but they weren't. Just poor quality. I'd stay away from these."
2,Beautiful but not very durable,"Although the colors are very bright and the fabric is nice, after two washings of these sheets, the bottom sheet has already started to ""fuzzball"" like a sweater, which I have never seen happen to bedsheets before."
2,Problems with the dye used to color the sheets,"I noticed that reviewers for some of the other colors of these sheets mentioned that after a few washings, ""spots"" would appear, as if they had been splashed with bleach. After having these sheets for two weeks, I started seeing these ""spots"" on the pillowcases (and no, there was never any bleach near the sheets or left over in the washer). I don't know what is causing the spots, but these sheets are pretty much ruined. Be careful, or stick with the white sheets."
2,Cheaply Constructed,"I have these sheets in this color (but in queen size), and after only five weeks, the stitching has come undone in several places on the pillowcases. In addition, the color fades unevenly in the wash making them appear splotchy. Finally, the color is susceptible to fading from acidic sweat. I have several places on the pillowcases and sheets that appear to have been bleached."
3,Soft sheets...,I have really enjoyed my sheets... but .. there are a couple of things that bothered me.One: there was a small stain( pinkish to red) when i first opened it up..two: one of the pillow covers has horizontal lines instead of vertical like the other one.. which matches with the bed sheets.. so.. it makes it look .. weird and strange ..But other then these 2 things.. i like the feel of the soft sheets..
2,Not so luxurious,"Material is nice, but top sheet shrunk so much that it will not tuck under mattress on both sides; it barely covers top of mattress. Fitted sheet is fine."
3,White sheets-wrinkled,"While the quality of the sheet is fine, I am disappointed with how they come out of dryer at the end of the cycle (and I remove right away) VERY WRINKLED! WRINKLED! Never lose wrinkles either. Have to iron them to make them look somewhat decent on the bed. Not like all my other cotton sheets."
1,"HORRIBLE PRODUCT, NOT MADE IN AMERICA, BAD QUALITY!","1. They are not made in America. They are made in Pakistan. 2. They do NOT FIT! I even took the elastic out of the fitted sheet and it is about 12 inches too short. Maybe this is how they fit in Pakistan, but not in the US!3. Not comfortable and the white looks pink. I bleached them several times and they still look pink'4. Great price, crappy product.My advice, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"
2,"Soft, but pills","I was really excited about this sheet set, but after I washed the set once and slept on them for 2 weeks, the fitted sheet started to pill. Also, I ordered a king set and they send me a California king set. I didn't mind since I like oversized sheets, but still. In any event the sheets are soft and nice to sleep on. For now, until they pill even further."
1,"Opinion faded with the color, softness and sateen shine","These sheets looked lovely when purchased, but after multiple washings, the sateen stripe faded and it only looks like a pattern of stripes on the sheet. The fabric is not soft at all and I have tried fabric softeners and hanging it out on the line to no avail. The casing is hemmed in one continuous pocket so the elastic slips around - the elastic is free to shift as it is not sewed within the hem. I've never seen anything like that and I hope I never will again. These sheets seem like something you would get at a bargain basement 5 and dime store. I do LOVE the color and that is why it got a star. I am extremely disappointed with the sheets."
4,A pretty good value.,"The sheets are comfortable, although I think a couple of washings helped. They've been pretty durable, too. I haven't bothered with the laundry instructions and they haven't shrunk or faded. The color is really rich and the sateen stripes look nice. The pockets on the fitted sheet are deep enough for a pillow top mattress.The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that the sheets are pretty thin. It doesn't get very cold where I live, but if it did I'd want something more substantial in the winter."
1,The worst I have ever owned,"I have bought inexpensive sheets before but these are the worst. These were VERY thin and once I washed them, they were like gauze. They also shrunk so that they no longer fit on my pillowtop mattress. They are now in the trash."
3,Safah collection 300-thread count khaki sheets - king,The sheets were more of a pea soup green and not a khaki color but they feel great and are very comfortable to sleep on. They feel very cool on hot days.
2,Betty Crocker Warn Delights,"I would not buy them again, but if you are desperate for a dessert and don't have anything else prepared, it would probably satisfy your cravings. Don't plan to serve it to guests though."
4,Better than it sounds,"These are a nice treat, but are very sweet. One for just me is a lot to handle. By the end of it, I am sick with sweet.That said, not bad for a microwave cake."
3,Not for beginners,"Mr Brozman is an exceptional slide guitarist and if you are an intermediate or better this could be a great learning tool. However, if you're a beginner, I recommend you look elsewhere. Why? 1) The small booklet that accompanys the DVDs is lacking and it is difficult to correlate what he's playing with what little info is written down. 2) He may be slowing down, but it is still very difficult to follow exactly what he's doing. I found I would spend a great deal of time watching and rewinding, watching and rewinding, etc and at the end of my practice session not felt like I had progressed...very frustrating. 3) He is starting from the assumption you know something about open tunings, so if you don't this can cause difficulties.I purchased a Mel Bay slide basics book that goes through open tunings in D, G and a couple of others. For a beginner or early intermediate, I suggest starting here, then move to BB's DVDs."
1,Useless,You have to either shout or put the microphone in your mouth to record some audible audio. Waste of money.
5,Peak of the Crop!,"I have had the French edition since 1983 and I can't live without it! This book is a must for FRENCH students, let alone for a foreigner wanting to learn the language. I speak five languages, and among all the language books I had through the years, the Hatier series is next to none :-) (Great for Spanish and German as well if you can get your hands on the respective Bescherelle titles). Whether you're a beginner or advanced student of French... just get it, eyes closed!"
5,Great tool!!!,"An invaluable tool and in my opinion an absolute must if you want to survive your kids French Immersion program, in especially in the intermediate and high school years !!!!!!!!!"
4,Very helpful,"I found out that it's the reference book that French language professors always have. If you're taking French lessons, it's a very helpful aid, specially for written assignments."
5,12000 verbs,it's very skinny and the print is TINY but there really are 12000 verbs. perfect for learning all sorts of new vocabulary. think of how many verbs are used in language! 12000 is just scratching the surface
5,BUY THIS BOOK if you need help conjugating!!!,"I've used this book for several years now (a couple of which I spent in France). This is a small book so you don't have to carry around a huge book, which is a necessity for anyone who might need to carry it around (like students). Easy to use. Like I said..buy this book. You won't regret it."
5,Nikon Camera Battery,This battery is exactly the same as the one that came with my Nikon Coolpix S600.
5,GREAT BACKUP BAT,"This battery is exactly like the one that came with the camera.Have used it when i go out and take lots of pictures, great to have a backup"
1,FAULTY BATTERY.,"I left it to charge over night and the battery ran out within minutes. I put it back on charge, but it doesn't work. The camera says low battery and shuts off."
1,Nikon EN-EL 10 battery,"Received two replacement batteries for my Nikon Coolpix camera. I charged the battery before use as per instructions, placed it in the camera and within two weeks, the battery was ""exhausted""! I put in the second battery that I purchased two days ago and am waiting to see if that one becomes ""exhausted"" too. I am very disappointed in this product ordered through Amazon.com. Not likely to order anything else."
1,horrible customer service,"i recieved a working battery,but i was only able to use it one time. after that one time use it has never worked again.. when i tried to contact the seller. seller never replied back to give me another working battery or to refund my money for a dead battery."
1,NOT GOOD BATTERY,The battery does not even last a year had it for 3 MONTH very bad battery now am going to have to buy other battery
5,just like the original,this battery is exactly like the original so you can not go wrong.. it is nice to have for an extra if you cannot charge your camera at the moment..
2,New Battery - Out of Date!,"Replaced the 2 year old battery in my Nikon Coolpix with what was advertised as replacement from Nikon. I received it in new packaging - but there was NO expiration date anywhere on the packaging. When it arrived I charged it for 24 hours to take pictures for Christmas. One week later when I wanted to take pictures for New Years, the BATTERY WAS DEAD!!!A NEW battery should have lasted many weeks before it needed recharging. I knew my OLD battery needed to be replaced when it only lasted a week on a full charge.Only conclusion -- it was a new battery that was past it's expiration date! Hey, Amazon, how does that happen?"
1,Battery life didn't last....,"I purchased 2 of these for my daughter's trip to Belgium. Upon arrival and fully charging both batteries, she noticed neither battery lasted very long and her camera was dead within a couple hours of use (lasted days on a full charge with original battery). Now, whenever we ""charge"" the battery, one only charges to 1/2 full and the other states it's already ""battery exhausted"". She didn't exhaust the original battery until after 1 full year's use. I'm very disappointed and luckily my daughter's companion in Belgium was able to take pictures on his iPhone so she could have some memories from her trip."
4,Like it....,The original Battery that came with the camera stop charging and i order a new one.So far i am happy with it. It is working well
3,"replacement battery received OK, but","This is the replacement battery I requested, since my origianl batttery was received ""dead"" on arrival.This repalcement battery was received quickly, and in good shape (= it worked).The only problem was that I had to pay to ship the original battery back. This added cost to my original purchase, that made ordering on-line about equal to pruchasing the battery locally."
1,Faulty Product will not charge a second time,"I ordered this for a back-up battery, Big Mistake!It was suppose to be new but I really don't think it was.I received it and charged it. The charge ran out in a shorter timeframe than my original battery.Well the problem is ""IT WILL NOT CHARGE AGAIN"".All the money I paid for it was a waste. Next time I will buy from a big box store.Was on vacation and the time frame for return has expired by Amazon. I am SOL."
3,RESUSCITATE,"Big disappointment, this new battery needed to be recharged before it could be used in my camera. Sure would have been helpful if this fact was mentioned in the product description."
3,I had ordered the wrong item...,I had ordered the wrong item but the return process was easy. I did have to email and check to see if they had received the item and if it was creditied to my account. It would have been nice to just get that email and not worry.
5,"OEM battery, exactly what comes with the camera","This is an OEM battery that fits the Nikon S60 camera. It looks, functions and works exactly as the battery does that comes with the camera. Expect exactly the same performance. It does come with a small plastic sleeve to store it."
1,Not satisified,We recieved the wrong battery sent it back with an explaination with what was wrong. Two and a half weeks later we recieved another battery whitch was the same battery as the first. So now i am out of the money and the proper battery. This time i will not send it back i will just eat the loss.
5,nikon camera battery,It's a genuine Nikon battery and appears to work great in My Coolpix camera. i would do it again !
4,Great Product,"I used this for my Coolpix and loved it. I would recommend to anyone who wants long battery life. I've had it for quite a while and it is still going strong. To me, it's lasting longer than the original battery."
2,Battery dead.,"I bought two batteries, one for the camera Casio and one for my Nikon. The battery for my Nikon came dead, will not charge. I'm very disappointed."
4,Nikon Battery,"I received the battery in a timely manner. It does work in the camera, but needs to be charged often. It may be that my camera is too old (three years). It is charging as I write this review. I was hoping to take pictures of the trick or treaters that came but my camera wasn't working because the battery needed to be charged again.Sadly enough there is no signal on my camera to let me know that the battery needs charging. So as I said before it may be the camera not the battery that is at fault."
5,Nikon Lithium battery,Was nice to be able to order the battery since we were unable to purchase one within a twenty mile radius of our home.
4,Good battery,"I bought this battery because my camera wasn't holding a charge. Come to find out I needed a software update not a new battery. Oh we'll, now I have a backup. Live and earn I guess. The new battery is working just fine on my Nikon Coolpix camera."
5,GREAT DEAL ON BATTERIES!,"FAST SHIPMENT ALLOWED ME TO CHARGE BATTERY BEFORE VACATION.THIS IS A BACK UP BATTERY AND PERFORMS AS EXPECTED, SO NOW I CAN ROTATE BATTERIES DURING TRAVEL, STARTING EACH DAY WITH A FRESHLY RECHARGED UNIT.THANK YOU AMAZON FOR HELPING ME FIND THE BEST DEAL AVAILABLE!"
2,battery keeps dying,battery appears to match my old one-wont hold charge for more than a few days . works ok to get by.
3,it worked,battery worked as it was supposed to...but i wasted my money on it since it didnt fix my camera...thanks for wasting money
5,A Vacation Lifesaver....,"The Nikon Coolpix S3000 is a fine camera and the original battery still works fine. I purchased an extra battery as an overseas vacation was coming up. Good thing I did! The camera clicked ""on"" while traveling (apparently again and again as it was being pressed in my pocket) and the battery ran down to zero. I simply swapped the battery upon discovery and it worked fine. By having the extra battery, I was able to take all the pictures/videos needed and then charge them at night. A good purchase and I'd recommend a second battery...or this one as the sole battery; it works well."

3,for George Eliot fans only,"Compared to Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss, Adam Bede is a dull read. Sure it has all the richness of George Eliot novels, but the story seems a bit contrived and the ending isn't very satisfactory."
5,A beautiful book,"I loved this book and could not put it down. Eliot does a wonderful job describing her characters. Their strong points become their downfalls in the end and only when they overcome their weaknesses do they succeed. For example, Hetty is the beautiful dairy maid. Her mannerisms are charming and complement her great beauty. Her beauty becomes her downfall because of the attention she receives from the local squire. The consequences of her behavior are not retractable and affect her and her family deeply. Hetty is just one of the many interesting women that Eliot portrays. Even though the title is ""Adam Bede"", Eliot manages to interlace important female characters throughtout the book."
3,A warning for Kindle users buying the Penguin Kindle edition.,"As far as the Kindle,Adam Bedeseems to be the best ""Adam Bede"" as far as the free classics go, though there are formatting errors and misspellings (I checked against the online version on Princeton University's site). I also tried the other free file that is available right now, but it was missing some text entirely.One paid version of ""Adam Bede"" I tried was this Penguin version, thinking it would be so much better (as well as a good deal for a Penguin version), but it wasn't. I got no further than the introduction before noticing errors that were not in the print version, which one can preview on Amazon. I got my money back for it, and decided that for the Kindle, free is good enough. If I pay, I'm likely to prefer a physical copy."
4,Nice Doll,"This isn't a bad doll like what most people say. I had her before, and she was fun to play with my 4 doll houses. Of coarse I had many other Loving Family grandparents, and they were about the same. I liked this doll."
4,Loving Family dollhouse figures,"I am disappointed that Fisher Price does not make the Grandma dollhouse figure in any people of color. There are plenty of the various figures as Caucasian, but there are limited choices for African-american. I also find it surprising that the brochures state that figures are also available in Hispanic but I have yet to see them."
2,Lonely Grandma with a removable skirt,"Poor Grandma has no Grandpa to live with so she lives with her cat-who comes with a pet carrier. But the lady has a Velcro skirt that is removable-unlike any of the other Loving Family members. So she spends a great deal of time in her undies. If you want grandparents to visit your dollhouse, this is about your only option. Just be prepared for her to run around without her skirt!"
3,The first CD feature from LA's superstar DJ,"Thomas Michael has always been known (sepecially in CA) for his incredible mixing talents, selecting only the most legendary music and blending it together flawlessly. This CD, although great, falls short of his standard of classic mix tapes. The new tracks by LSG and Seafield, among others, really stand out!"
1,Don't buy it!,It doesn't keep your cup of tea or coffee any warmer than if you left it on a coaster on your desk. I replaced it with a Mr. Coffee unit which works great in keeping my cup for hours as I work at my computer.
2,mising parts,I though this would come with the clamp to secure it to a workbench. Didnt come with it. I had to make something instead of dealing withh all kinds of mailing and emails for a dumb part.
2,Poor joints,"Good magnification, good lighting... but the joints suck... especially the joint between the arm and light... very flimsy and no matter how hard you crack it tight the light's weight is too much for the nut and screw they use. get what you pay for i guess."
3,Basic Lamp,"I ordered a basic adjustable magnifier lamp... it arrived as expected, in a timely manner."
4,not sure.,Im not sure if my Ram likes it or not havn't seen it eat it yet. But im sure this is a good product. The ingredents are pure. when i drop some in my tank they float for a long time; they don't sink unless you push them against the glass to make them soak water up.
5,"Great, Large Pellets!","We have a Central / South American Cichlid tank and they love these floating pellets. They are quite large, so make sure your fish are big enough. As a point of reference, they are just a bit too big for a full grown Convict. We use Hikari food in our other tanks as well and think it's a quality product."
4,i think my fish would give the same review ?,"trusted brand, the fish hasnt complained yet. i usually mix these with the other hikari pellets like the veggie ones, shrimp pellets & live food for my midas."
2,"Bad design, good idea","I don't know what they were thinking. The bracket attaches to the handle bars, but there is no third point of attachment, so it forms a pivot or hinge. Even if you screw it down tight it will still sag until it hits your front wheel or fender. I am going to put something between the stem and the back of the basket to keep this from happening, but you would think they could have figured this out themselves.The basket itself is nice and the quick release is well engineered. But given the choice, I would not have bought it after watching it slowing sag away..."
5,Form meets Function,"After extensive research in the bicycle basket area, I chose this model and I'm very happy I did! This basket is a great value for the price. I had it installed at my local bicycle shop, because my computer had to be moved and I didn't want to fiddle with it, but it seemed to be an easy enough task. The best feature is that the basket comes off if needed. It's extremely easy to just slide this off and on. There's even a lift up handle so you can carry the basket around, which I do at garage sales and markets! When I originally opened the box, I thought the basket was huge, but once it was installed and used, I've decided that it's just right! This basket has a smaller mesh design, so you don't have to worry about smaller things falling through it. I think it's also a nicer shape, more rounded, than the standard square models. This model is both stylish and functional. I'd definitely recommend this!"
2,"well, it lasted a week","i was totally excited for the large size & small mesh of the basket, but the thing was off of my bike within a week. it lost a screw, which made the basket slide down & hit my tire.the assembly instructions were nonsensical (pictures only) & the unit as a whole is not sturdy enough to handle it's own size.i am now sans-basket. again."
1,Poor design made it an expensive laundry basket,"This product failed the first time I used it. It threw all my groceries out of the basket, and if I hadn't used a bungie cord, they would have gone into the street. The connection device is poorly engineered, and now it holds my bicycle laundry, gloves, hats, and helmet."
2,"Nice looking basket, but structurally deficient","I have owned this basket for two years. It is very stylish and has a powered epoxy finish to prevent corrosion. It attaches to the handlebars but I needed to provide additional support underneath to carry groceries without the basket wobbling precariously. Even with this additional support, the bracket containing the handlebar grips eventually separated from the basket. The metal mesh literally ripped apart from the mounting bracket. I do not use this basket for decoration or carrying light loads as I use my bike for much of my shopping. Anyone wanting a front basket for such utilitarian use should consider a basket that has, besides handlebar grips, strut supports attaching to the front wheel axle, such as some of the Wald models. Such baskets do not lift off, a feature not required in any case if you use a shopping bag, but they are much less likely to break when carrying a couple quarts of milk and a five pound bag of flour over the bumps and ruts."
4,Front bicycle basket,"Installation was simple, my five year old niece assisted me in the process. The basket is the perfect size and sturdy. Loves it."
2,great basket with brain dead mounting system,"I wish I'ld seen the reviews before I bought it. Mine doesn't sag but only because I noticed the incipient problems and put washers behind all the screws before they tore through. Even with that, its unbelievably bouncy. It really needs a second mount point. Engineering one now."
5,Cool basket,"This is a great looking basket. I was a bit worried that it may not hold much, as far as weight is concerned. But, that is not a problem with my bike, as my front reflector seems to keep it stabled just fine.If you do purchase this basket, don't forget to put the one inch strips of foam inside of the handlebar attachment, to keep it from slipping. I had to take apart to put them in, because I had forgotten to do that, (or rather, didn't know where they went until I had it all together)."
2,Not sturdy enough for regular use,"I agree with previous reviewer about difficulty of getting the basket firmly mounted to the handlebars so that it is secure and doesn't move. With a lot of effort, though, I was able to do that. The problem I had, and the reason why I now need to buy a new basket, is that the basket cannot handle much weight. After a year's use where I have put books and other objects that are not super heavy but not light either, the basket has become unwelded to the bracket and thus completely unusable."
2,not for anything heavy,"the good: generally seems well made. it will probably serve you well if you want to carry small, light loads. the quick-release works well.the bad: if you carry anything substantial or dense, the handlebar mount is not up to the task and will tend to let the basket ""droop"" down. if you tighten it up as hard as you can, you might get it to stay if you are lucky. so books or groceries are out of the question for this basket.on mine after using it for a year or so, the the basket eventually gave way (metal mesh actually tore away) around the mount, probably due to metal fatigue, so once again i would NOT recommend this for serious hauling duty. for that i suspect you would be much better served by a basket that has struts going down to the front forks."
3,Bought sight un seen,"I was surprised when they arrived. I bought these the same time I bought my Shure isolating earphones. Had I waited and tried what came with the Shure earphones I would have stuck with the black soft rubber ones that came with the earphones. However, these fit fine and work pretty well, they are not as comfortable and well fitting as the rubber ones though. There are also some clear stiffer soft plastic ones that come with the earphones that don't fit well at all because they don't flex to conform to the ear shape. I'd use these foam ones before I'd use the clear ones."
5,Best discussion on Secession ever.,"This book is the best discussion on the subject of Secession I have ever seen. This topic is so important and yet so ignored. No one can understand the ""Civil War"" with out understanding this important topic. The Right of succession is a crucial element of protecting liberty and this book Provides the best possible understanding of it available."
3,"good as far as it goes, but incomplete","This book deals with the issue of secession from a mostly normative, America-centric position. The authors adequately defend the necessity of secession & decentralization for the advance of liberty, but the analysis does not go much beyond that. There is altogether too much material on the War between the States, an event that happened 150 years ago and has little relevance for the philosophical, political, economic, and even legal issues facing secessionists today. There is very little empirical content, very little attempt to explain why secessionist movements arise and how they can succeed.I am very glad this book was made: it serves a certain purpose. However, we need sophisticated social scientists studying secessionism from a sympathetic perspective. See my other reviews of books on secessionism that deal with the issue from an empirical, comparative perspective."
1,How did these people ever get grammy nominations,Just listen to the Presidents of the United States of America one time and you will never go back to this . This is a sad excuse for music.
1,Tasteless Garbage,"Not worth one star, more like negative stars to the power of - what does EEEEEEE mean on my calculator?I had the misfortune of being subjected to this at an acquaintance's party. Only tasteless tone-deaf fools with more money than sense would mistake this for music. Why not just pay a drunken moron to slur words at you - its the same thing.How we ever sank from the glory, beauty and majesty of ochestral music to this offensive audio-swill is beyond my comprehension.If you buy this it won't die off. Don't waste your money, buy real music."
4,marvelous Massenet,"Renee fleming is at her best in this genre,Massenet does so seem to bring out all that is beautiful,expressive use of tecnique,with superb legato combined with thoughtfull portrayal ,one wonders is Werthers Charlotte her next choice.Alvarez is not ideal it should have been Vargas,but with the rest of the cast supporting in strenght,4 stars is appropriate.Costumes were good,but lack of good scenery did nothing to help the performance which with Lopez Cobos coducting the Paris Orchestra,should have been a riot of colour in sound and vision."
1,Poor Imitation,I was very dissappointed to hear this CD. Vince Seneri is not the legend that he portrays himself to be on this CD. There is no continuity throughout the recordings and you can hear errors in some of the songs.Very dissappointing !!!!
1,Urban Paradise,I was not partcularly fond of this production. His version of Eleanor Rigby doen not compare to the Original written & recorded by the BEATLES !
4,Excellent reference,"I've found this to be a great little reference to have nearby when I need to remind myself of o-chem concepts. As small as it is, though, it covers just about everything in an undergrad course. I used it as a study guide - almost like a stack of index cards - know this book and you'll have an excellent foundation."
3,Product Great-Service poor,"I purchased these shoes for Christmas and selected regular shipping because there was plenty of time before Christmas for the product to be shipped. I received the product 3 days after Christmas. I didn't feel that paying additional money for shipping was necessary because all websites were advertising Guaranteed standard shipping by Christmas if orders placed by December 18th. I placed my order on the 13th. I placed another online order the next day and received it within 4 days, regular shipping. I would not use this website for a gift ever again."
5,Los Trio bolero are talented,"My name is Andrea Ramos. I'm thirteen years old and I love their music. Boleros are probably the best way to express you feeling, and they do this especially well. If I had a chance to speak to them in person or on-line, I wouldn't hesitate. I think they should continue with their music and singing music from El Trio Matamoros; they do this well. These Colombianos represent Colombia especially well. If they read this message, I hope they will e-mail me back. Congratulaciones Grupo Los Tri-o! Sigan con su musica!"
5,Fabulous!,"I was at work one day and decided to borrow some music from someone else. He handed me this CD and I can only say that I was so impressed that I got onto Amazon.com and bought it that day! I know only a smattering of Spanish and nothing about current Latin American music, but these guitarists really create a lively and uplifting atmosphere that keeps me working at my desk even through the most boring tasks. I've literally replayed this over and over again on the same day and never been bored. If you are interested in trying something new, start with this CD."
5,Classical music! New talent!,"It is a beautiful collection of boleros that remains true to the classic trio, Los Panchos. The surprise here is that the musicians are a trio of young men who simply amaze us with their talent and their music that even our grandparents can enjoy. The medley version (each track is a medley of two-three songs) can be a little annoying, but it also serves to showcase more songs. I hope this Trio will be inspired to produce more albums with more boleros."
5,"Nice tribute, more complete songs next time.","Being a longtime fan of Trio Los Panchos, I was pleasantly suprised at how well--albeit with younger voices--their sound was recreated. One suggestion though, for the next album please record the entire song, rather than use the medley format.S. Sotelo"
5,Love it!!!,"Great service! It got here very fast and CD is new like they said. I have been looking for this CD for a while, great music. It became a wonderful present for a very special person. Thank You!"
5,great book for researcher,If you're interested in FC protocol detail this book is right for you. After reading through the whole book you will find it's easiler to understand FC standards... Hopefully the author can include more figures especially flowcharts in next edition.
3,Nice relax music but unnatural overall with other instrument,"Destiny is my first CD of Giovanni and it reminds me Paul Mauriat/Frank Pourcel whose I used to listen 25 years or so ago. Piano solo is fine, however, something really bothers me with the drums. I am not sure if Giovanni has a real drumer playing or the drum was synthesisered/computerized.In any cases, I found several songs on this CD unnatural & uncomfortably to listen to just because the drum sounds on the background."
4,My first CD of Giovanni and sold out for more.,"I've heard a Giovanni sample strolling by a little shop in some touristy town. It called my attention the vibrancy and emotion of what he was playing then that I stopped window shopping and just listened.Finally I found one CD, Destiny, liking cuts 2 thru 5 and 8 thru 11. His artistry playing the piano does not need the exagerated pirotecnics of reverberation, perhaps a bit cavernous for my taste.It is a good CD to listen for relaxation. It is in the same league of easy listening as Raul Di Blasio, Yanni, David Lanz, Phil Coulter, Michael Jones or Lorie Line. If you like that syle of piano playing, you must certainly enjoy Destiny."
5,"Photo not accurate, but very happy with my product","I had purchased a Wilton Cupcake decorating kit that contained the famous 1M tip, and my dad had accidentally dropped it down the drain and crushed it with that motor thing (forgot what it is called). I frantically searched for an alternative and settled for this one even though the tip that they have in the photo looks nothing like the one I had. However the description fit what I was looking for so I took a chance, and I am so happy I did! The tip is the wilton 1M tip which is large and has a rather spikey open star. I am very happy with my product and shipping was very fast! So do not be fooled by the picture if you are looking for that 1M tip that I described. Hope this review helps. Happy Baking! :)"
1,"Great concept, but I would rather read Jackie Collins","I have read the reviews of Pfitz, but sincerely disagree as it being proclaimed cerebral. While the concept is ok, Crumley eventually loses credibility as a writer with silly 'thought provoking' issues that only Dan Quayle would find fascinating. He tries to throw in too many concepts, and the reader simply loses interest. He even insults literature and authors. I finished the book, and afterward I was longing to read a Jackie Collins novel. I enjoy a rich novel bred from intelligence, but Andrew Crumley's Pfitz was as boring as dirty dish water. If there had been a choice of an 1/8 star, that's what I would've rated this annoying 'book'. I think I found four pages interesting. I will now write something as silly as Pfitz--this book will leave you in fits, and should only be read if one enjoys being annoyed."
2,"Potentially clever, poorly executed.","'Pfitz' amounts to no more than Italo Calvino fan fiction. While Crumey sets up a potentially fresh work of postmodernist fantasy, he handles it with the clumsiness of a precocious 14-year-old.Read Diderot's 'Jacques The Fatalist' and Calvino's 'Invisible Cities,' and ignore this useless combination of the two."
2,Lost in Imagination,"I had to pick a nonamerican author of a novel, and this book sounded great. I like Europe. I thought it had a great start in the first chapter about the Prince who buils 5 cities that fit the imagination, but after that it gets crazy. I mean he doesn't tell you the red head girls name Estrella till chapter 11. He makes it seem that the Prince is the main character and turns out not to be. Mr. Crumey likes to take part in conversations with the reader and interject the story with parenthises stating previous events or his own opinion. I think it was good but a little complicated so if your not into really thinking don't read it. Oh and don't use it for a 4 page book review for English class."
1,"Confusing, chaotic, much repeated info","Someone must have been trying to fill up pages in this book. There is a writing about each prisoner, much of it copied from the documents, newspaper articles, etc. that were listed afterwards since it had much of the same wording... I got to read so much of the same verbage over and over again that I thought I was in some daja-vue time warp.In addition to that waste of time, the documents and articles were not in chronological order, even when it was from the same newspaper!"
5,slick,"It's a nice mouse pad for gaming. Low friction surface, big enough but not too big for my desk. Works well with my logitech g5."
5,Asparagus roots,"I received these in a couple days! They were all healthy. I planted them all, all came up within 5 days. Look great, thanks again for a fine product."
4,Great Rings/Redwall/Narnia Precursor for Younger Children,"Steel Magic was a favorite of mine growing up - I probably read it 3 or 4 times. I recently ordered it for my children, and I reread it before I passed it on to them. Norton's world retains a magic and wonder that should entrance just about any child. But when I was growing up we did not have Lord of the Rings, the Redwall series, Narnia (well, it was there, I just hadn't discovered it), or the many other well-developed fantasy worlds both in print and the visual media of today. So a worldly pre-teen might now find Steel Magic to be a little simple in comparison to the plethora of other fantasy stories now available.That is not to detract from Norton's fine storytelling ability. Buy this book for a nine-to-twelve year old who has not yet delved into Tolkien or Jacques. A fine tale."
1,GridLock Puppy Pads LEAK,"I bought this product after reading the ""good reviews""... I am NOT happy with these GridLock Puppy Pads at all. I have a teacup Yorkie and if I don't pick up the pad immediately after she goes potty the urine leaks out and spreads all under the pad area. At first you pick up the pad thinking you are just going to change it and then you notice your hardwood floors look glossy... oh it's urine 24"" x 24"". These are causing an odor problem as well as staining my hardwood floors. Don't waste your money.. Go to Costco and buy their 100ct Puppy Pads for $19, they work great or should as say as they are supposed to."
5,Best out there!,"I have a little yorkie and this is by far the most superior product I've used for her, since she is an indoor dog. I have found that these are slightly larger than the pad holder I use, which is great, absorbs more than the others I have tried, and there is NO odor after she uses it, which was a problem with the other ones I had used. One will last an entire day, as sometimes with the other ones I had to change it 2-3 times a day. Like others who have tried this product, I will not go back to using any other product. This is far superior to the brand I was using and I would highly recommend it."
4,24x24 pads,The pads work just fine and their price is good but it is misleading to say they are 24x 24 when the pad part itself is not that size it is the plastic behind that is 24x 24.
5,"the bestest potty pads for dogs, I've used the for my dog for 5 yrs.","these are the only pads I'll use for my dog. She has been potty-trained on these pads from the time she was a puppy. ""Skittles"", my shih-tzu loves these pads and has been using them for going on 6 yrs. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,Good pads.,"Very good pads for the price. Doesn't leak. The only downside is that it doesn't mask the smell very well. Other than that one con, these pads are very worth the price that is being asked."
5,Fantastic!!!!,"These are the best pads I have tried! Large, thick enough not to leak and they hold a lot of urine without smelling bad. Next time I will buy the ones with the tape in back, that way I won't waste time taping them down myself. Will defenitely buy these again and again and again."
3,Very absorbent pads!,"These pads are very absorbent and reasonably priced. They don't leak and are strong.But, as far as the scent attractant, my pup will walk across these pads to piddle on the carpet on the other side. Does not work for me at all."
2,"Great Absorbency, Not Comfortable for puppies","I was very excited when I read all the reviews for Gridlock Puppy Training wee wee pads in hopes that it would be the magic pad for my magic mutt. Although I was pleased at the absorbency and quick drying, my puppy did not share the same feelings...everytime she tried to squat her tiny paws would slip and she could not get a grip when going on the pad... though soft, its very slippery. I'm a little sad I bought a 100...I'll keep them for traveling...This is the third brand she has tried, and she was much more responsive to the other two...I would buy a small pack first."
1,Fake gridlocks,"I have been buying Gridlock pee pads for 3 years. This is the first time I have purchased them through Amazon.com. (sold by digipets). They arrived promptly, but are NOT the original Gridlock product. They are not thick and sturdy; not different from the cheap products I can get at my local no-name department store. I am terribly disappointed and will never order from this supplier again."
2,Not that great,Can not recommend. Flimsy and thin. Will try a different brand next time. Feel kind of ripped off by this product.
2,Leaks!,"This product was cheaper, but not the cheapest. I found that they do not absorb fast enough and if your beloved pochie goes too close to the edge it leaks off onto the floor. Not good! I would not purchase again."
5,GREAT PRODCUT!!,This is the third brand I have tried. These are the best by far.Super absorbent. I have a small Yorkie (4 lbs) so don't know how well they work on larger dogs but for my dog it is far superior to the other brands I have tried. No leakage! I have one in several of my rooms since she has the run of the house and so far no accidents. Nice!! Ordering it via Amazon is super easy and convenient!!
2,"Great pad, however...","Don't get me wrong, it's a great pad but if I could spend a little less for the same thing, I would. Search around Amazon and you'll see what I'm talking about. Hope this helps!"
2,Meh,I dont really like this product. The pads are flimsy. I used four of them out of the hundred I ordered and I wont be using them again. I'll probably donate them to a shelter.
3,Great product but....,"We have 4 toy dogs so, these come in very handy. They work great except with one or two shipments the product seemed different in that the pads didn't absorb as well as the prior shipments and they leaked through the bottom liner. I called the company with my concern and it was as if I was making it up and all they said was that they did nothing different and that was that. I find the conpany customer service no help when you have a question or a problem either on the product quality or your order.If there is no issues, the product is great!"
4,Good Songs/Wierd Selection,"I really like the songs on this CD. However, I was hoping for some of the more popular songs that were performed. Even though this CD doesn't have the greatest selection in the world, I would still recommend it."
5,A variety of the year's hottest songs packed into one cd!,"This cd is awesome! It has the hottest songs most of which unavailable as a single so you're really getting your money's worth. The nominees are great this year and this cd really summarizes 1998 with the songs we heard every day. I highly recommend this one, it's very eclectic and there's one song for everyone, although Save Tonight by Eagle Eye Cherry is sure to be everyone's top pick. Great CD! Buy it!"
5,This Cd Rocks.,"This is the best Grammy Cd. It has every awesome song. For exmaple it has Save Tonight from Eagle-Eye Cherry, Lauryn Hill Doo Wap That Thang and more. This Cd Kicks seroius butt so get it."
2,Not that great,"I bought this CD thinking that I would be getting this great CD. But, it kinda sucked. It had about two good songs. Eagle Eye Cherry and Goo Goo Dolls was OK. In easier terms, DON'T buy it. Just get the Eagle Eye Cherry CD."
4,Good Pop,"The Grammy CD has always been like a ""Now"" for adults, but this one is more pop than usual. Shania Twain, Natalie Imbruglia, Backstreet Boys, and Lauryn Hill offer up enough pop for everyone, and in many forms. More mature singers such as Sting, Shawn Mullins, and Eric Clapton actually take a back seat on this album. Alternate Reality."
3,Not really exceptional,"Commenting on the tracks on this CD is more like judging whether America's National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences still honours good music. But that is something one only could say with a pinch of salt.The Record of the Year nominees, as usual, are musical showpieces of their time. In terms of quality, however, barring the goo goo dolls and Celin Dion, rest of the stuff is fairly mediocre. Brandy and Monica hardly appeal to muscial aesthetics. Ray of light is a shocking.There is good talent, however, in the male pop vocalist category; Shawn Mullins, Eric Clapton and Brian Mcknight deserve some marks. On the New Artist grouping ... some of today's most versatile and successful singers have been winners as Best New Artist- Natalie Cole, Tracy Chapman, Mariah Carey, Bette Middler.. none of those on this collection reveal that promise... but, till some thing better comes along, this will do..."
4,Excellent album,"I bought this album for the fact that Celine Dion, Backstreet Boys, Madonna, Brian McKnight and others were on it. There's a lot of 1997 songs on here on a l999 album and some 98 stuff. I like Torn by Natalie Imbruglia--they played that like crazy in 98 and its popular with the guys. Sometimes, with Grammy awards they play it safe on the telecast, but this album has a lot more edge with Backstreet being on it to get it over the ballads that dominate the second half. It was a smartly done effort to get the Grammy committee with the modern times."
2,Not the Best,"The 1999 nominations for the ""Grammy"" awards compacy disc was extremely dissapointing. The varaity of different types of music made me dislike it. There is a version of the Backstreet Boys ""Backstreet's Back"" that I've never heard of before. Also they have opera (?) music with Andrea Bocelli. I think that it is great that he a nomination, same with the Dixie Chicks. But country and opera aren't the kind of music that deserve a place on a compact disc that ages 10-15 are the majority of people that buy it. I'd say pop, rock, alternative, and rap are the main choices in music that pre-teens choose. If you like Opera, country, pop, and soft rock, this is the album for you. But if your around 12 and 13 I would not recommend this, so save your money and go buy something else!"
5,Like A Fine Wine...,"Truly better with time... I have been a fan since I first heard her voice. Such a mix of Jazz & R&B, that there is no other quite like Anita. She has been missed! Such quality and style has been gone for too long in the music business and radio. This new CD shows that she has lost none of the abilities she had before, quite the opposite. All she has lived through in the last 10 years and all she has experienced in her life comes out in her amazing voice. The title track draws you in, and with songs like Serious, you can't go wrong. Welcome back girl! Now teach these kids a thing or two or three or four... :)"
5,"Welcome back, Anita!","In this day and age of overproduced, ""artificial"", no-talent pop, it is refreshing to have another album out from a genuine ""artist"", one who can truly carry the label ""artist"". Anita Baker can make any song sound good with a voice like that. Much of the album is along the same line as her previous work and that is what she does best. I am really thankful that she did not go the way of so many talented soul singers who sold out by cooperating with rap and hip hop producers."
3,THE RETURN OF ANITA,"I believe that I am not alone when I say that we all have awaited this CD for the past 10 years. I am a life long Anita Baker fan. Listening to this CD, I realize that there are certain artists that master their craft and Anita is one of those. She has chosen a style that is totally hers and she does not branch out from it; I appreciate that in an artist. She is not willing to compromise her style for anything. Stand out cuts include the title track ""You're My Everything"" and ""The Men In My Life"", which is a tribute to her husband and sons. The voice is flawless as always and the soul is intact. Anita reminds so much of ""The Divine One"", Sarah Vaughn. She is truly classic."
2,Boring!!! Nothing groundbreaking here.,I was looking forward to this and was disappointed to hear a new album that sounds like more of her old stuff. :-(
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,"This album sounds outdated and most of the songs are flat and boring, especially the song with babyface. An UNREMARKABLE & FORGETTABLE CD. What was she thinking? Ten years waiting and she serves her fans this awful concotion. I'll just go back and listen to her classic stuff. Teena Marie's New CD ""La Dona"" sounds WAY BETTER than Anita's CD, even the jazz cuts on Teena's album have more soul punch...this album is way below my expectation. Anita Baker, you are a BEAUTIFUL, TALENTED, SOULFUL ENCHANTRESS with a VOICE that leaves one BREATHLESS and in AWE...Those songs are no match for your talent...You are WORTHY & DESERVING of BETTER SONGS...Until the next CD..."
1,Don't burn your brigdes behind you!!,"Babyface sued singer Anita Baker for allegedly failing to pay him for a song he produced for her. He filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against fellow R&B; artist Anita Baker alleging she owes him at least $250,000. Babyface co-wrote and produced the incredible song ""Like You Used to Do,"".It's kinda hard to beleive this, but it seems Anita decided to con her producer even if the album went gold with 500,000 sold copies. I purchased this CD because I had heard about this duet with Babyface and ""Like You Used to Do"" is the best track on the album."
3,Not too bad...,"perhaps it is because it been years since I've heard those ""back throat"" vocals or maybe it's because I was notably surprised that she can still produce that sound...in either case, Anita still sounds pretty ""crisp and clean"" with her vocals throughout this CD. I do agree, however, that she should have deferred to Mr. George Duke for the musical arrangements instead of just the ""mixing""....surely it would have been more than ""not too bad""..."
5,The Angel Sings Again...,"This cd is a MUST HAVE...there is absoutely no way around it! There should be no discussion or contemplation...just buy it and you'll see why Anita Baker is ""Queen of the Quiet Storm""! The songs are just so beautiful and refreshing...I just smile with pure joy as I hear her sing; her voice is still as strong as ever and she continues to convince the world of how important and wonderful love is. Every song is great; there is no way I can pick a favorite.I was but a mere child when Anita Baker first started singing and then I didn't really understand what she was singing about, but I felt the beauty of her expression in my soul. I am glad to say that now, as a young woman, I am able to understand and even relate to her music. She is a true talent and remarkable gift to the world. There is none and there will never be another artist like her! Her return is exactly what the industry needs...may God bless her with continued peace and success."
3,"A great singer, singing monotonous, non-descript love songs","First let me say that I love Anita Baker, so to all of those who gave ""My Everything"" five stars, please don't come down on me like a sledgehammer. Anita's ""Rapture"" is one of my favorite CD's of all time. ""Giving You the Best That I've Got"" and ""Rhythm of Love"" are also great. She could sing the phone book, and her voice would sound just as special.Unfortunately, the song selection on ""My Everything"" is so tepid and uninteresting, Anita may just as well have recorded the yellow pages. Remember gems like ""Sweet Love"", ""Rules"", and ""Body and Soul""? There is not one number on ""My Everything"" that comes close to their standard. I'm sorry, but the repertoire on this collection is dull, dull, dull. Very disappointing. What happened???Next time, Anita, don't give us your ""Everything"". Stick with gifting us with your magnificent voice and leave the songwriting to someone else."
3,What happened?,"Sorry folks, but I have to agree with the reviewers who were critical of this album. I'm not saying it's really bad, but I really would be less critical if this were her first effort. However, Anita had proven time and time again that she can do A LOT better. Not a bad CD to have in your collection if you can find a cheap used copy, but I personally am partial to Compositions or Rapture."
3,Not quite the same ole love,"Let me just say first off, I LOVE ANITA, but this album is not up to her very very high standards. I totally aggree with the above reviewer who said that the material, lyrics in particular are dull. Yes, exactly, its not the instrumental element, its obviously not her voice, its the material which if sung by ashanti would make doves cry out in scretching horror. I'm sorry but its just not her best lyrical material, which fans of hers come to expect. I give it 3 stars because she sounds good, the music sounds okay, but you don't feel it, you don't feel it, and you always feel Anita. Usually her first single grabs me, knocks me out, I was never feelin' My Everything at all. But maybe this album will sound better with time???"
3,Just in time,"Just when you thought true soul music was dead, Anita Baker returns to the scene to remind those who were influenced by her just why she is the diva of the classic soul genre. While it is great to have her back, there is not much variation or growth in the actual music. Her voice is in fine shape, no doubt about it, but most songs lack a hook which render them as not being particularly memorable. ""My Everything"" is a stand out, and it is great to have her back on the scene. Next time I just hope she chooses some stronger songwriters. More than anything, I hope this will be a return for classic soul in general. Now Miki Howard and Randy Crawford need to release new material, and we will be on our way back. There is room for all genres of soul music."
5,She hasn't lost her touch,the album is a must buy if you're an Anita fan of the past. The songs are great and the voice is at its best.
4,Staying alive,"I've read the reviews and I don't agree with you guys at all.Even if she's back from a long time to me this is refreshingto the music now a days. Especially what you hear on theradio in the Netherlands.Forgive me to say that Anita Baker just have to stay the same.Isn't that the way we love here.Why else would you buy her songs when her album is coming out?I love the songs and her voice. It is still gorgious, beautiful and hearable.This is the music which am longing to hear again on the radio.Real songs without any distracting thoughts behind the words aswe can see and hear them on radio or television.But real lyrics from the heart and soul from a true performer."
4,Good music transcends time.,"I'm what you would call a new Anita Baker fan. I started getting into Anita on Rhythm of Love when I was 21 years old. Although I grew up hearing Anita in the house since my cousin who is 8 years older than me always played her music, so I'm familiar with all of her music. Ten years later I bought her greatest hits cd and was eagerly anticipating the new cd. Age and maturity does alot for you. I must say, the style is classic Anita. I for one am glad that she sounds like how I remembered. My appreciation for her style has grown in the last ten years and now I can complete my collection. Some people have mixed feelings about the new music, complaining about it sounding dated or nothing new. Funny, I always thought good music transcended time."
3,Very nice CD !,"I love Anita but I am not crazy about her latest one!It's too short and doesn't add anything to her discography.But I like it the same,because I like her voice.It has been long time that I play it !I have to admit that my favorite album ,at the moment,is the fantastic 'LAZY AFTERNOON' by another great Lady,Regina Belle.Have you tried it ? Do it,you'll love it....."
3,Good but not her best,"I love Anita Baker and own all her CDs. This one won't be your favorite, but it is good...her voice makes any song regardless of the lyrics enjoyable. I think I had waited so long for her latest CD and hold her to such a high standard is why I only gave it 3 stars; if she where anyone else I probably would have given it 4 stars. She still leaves most of todays female vocalist standing in her shadow."
1,"I'm a fan, but this CD is not good at all, sadly...","I played this CD once. As soon as I bought it I popped it into my car's CD player and sat back and listened from beginning to end...During my drive it was just me, my car, and Anita...and I have to say I was very disappointed. Where's the fire, emotion, and true soulness of the previous CDs she put out? Maybe 1 or 2 songs sounded interesting, their names have been forgotten, but the rest just puts one to sleep. Come on Anita, get back to the fire, emotion, and true soulness of your sound...not this boring, and what seemed to be rushed, half-hearted, ""not hungry anymore""...STUFF."
3,Still Talented,"Well this is no ""Rapture"" and to tell the truth...even ""Rhythm of Love"" sounds better. OK I'll admit this is my least favorite of all her work BUT the lady has still got great talent. Her voice remains soulful yet classic. She is still able to give me 'goose bumps'. I just wish she had better material to work with. Yet there are some good songs on this album..like ""Your're my everything"", ""Men in my life"", ""Close your eyes"", ""How does it feel"" and ""Like you used to"". Whatever happens these 'nowadays fly by night' barbie dolls have nothing on her. She has one of the most unigue sound and I hope she keeps putting out more stuff."
4,I'm Glad She's Back,"I'm sooo glad she's back. I have definitely enjoyed this CD and with she and Babyface hooking up, could not have been a better match. Compare if you must, but this is still a great CD."
2,like you used to do,"i don't know, i wanted to love this cd, 'specially since it's been a minute for miss baker. i LOVED rhythm of love cause there were so many different colors. this time, seems the vocals were just phoned in. like a lot of others i'm glad to have miss baker back but not at the expense of great material. the saving grace are the backgrounds by perri.maybe for the next go round, blue note can get jon cowherd and brian blade to produce and they can come up with a cd as exquisite as lizz wright's ""salt"" or ""glamoured"" from cassandra wilson."
1,Lousy,"This is sheet music transcription at its laziest. Weak chords subtitute the complex originals, and none of the rythmic nuance chords are in there either. You will be disappointed if you think you will sound like Steely Dan learning the songs from this book."
5,great buy,Lost my original buttons for my french cuff shirt. Got these classy silver knots and am very happy. Strongly recommend!
1,Worst. Feintuch. Ever.,"Just skip this one altogether, and go straight to Patriarch's Hope. Of all the people to whom I have lent the Hope series, no one was even able to get halfway through ""Voices"" without giving up in disgust.A failed experiment, which, fortunately, he did not copy in the following two books, both of which are fine additions to the Seafort Saga."
5,A compelling population polarization pageant.,"It is imperative for the Feintuch fan to read this book. The despair evident in Nick is manifested somewhat less in his son, Jared, who shares the family preoccupation with guilt. The quite possible social implications are enormously compelling and extraordinarily frightening. Not so much good vs. evil as the misled colliding. This book should appeal to the socially concerned as well as one just seeking a good read. Feintuch successfully makes you think!"
2,The worst book in the series,This book was a major disappointment. As opposed to the other books in the series it was slow moving and had almost none of the classic 'space opera' scenes that defined the earlier books. I would encourage others who have read the earlier books not to waste their time on this one. I can only hope that his next book returns to the classic writing style of the first 4 books.
1,"Unbelieveable, boring and hard to read.","There is apparently a series of these, of which this is the only one I have read.This book could not make me suspend my disbelief at all. The motivation behind the basic premise of the main character was unbelieveable - and this made most of the subsequent actions silly.Unfortunately, it was also boring, as something like three quarters of the book was an introduction to the last quarter, which amounted to little more than a city riot.I also find books which hope for authenticity by imbuing their characters with EXTREMELY badly accented speeches very hard to read.Sorry, but the other books in this series must be better..."
1,Feintuch's Voices ...,"The book is written in the first person with a number different narrators. All these storytellers are supposed to be children (or young teens) but none of their voices is even remotely convincing. Feintuch spends much of this narrative outlining (sometimes using what I see as racist patois) how whiny, unreasonable, and downright stupid the characters are. Example: ""My voice what Changman call sullen .... My voice come in squeak. I bring it low, Redface."" (p. 22) The story, compelling as some elements of it may be, cannot overcome Feintuch's sophomoric writing."
2,My least favorite of the Seafort books,"Voices of Hope is quite different from the other books in the Seafort series. It is told from several points of view, including that of Nick's son Philip, Adam Tenere's son Jared, and two members of the transpop culture represented in earlier books by Eddie and Annie. While the differing narratives are occasionally interesting, I found none of them as compelling as Nicholas Seafort's narratives in the other novels. Furthermore, the transpop chapters are written in a dialect I found almost unreadable. There is more violence in this book than in the others, and the transpop setting of most of the novel is bleak and disturbing. This story is gloomy even for a Seafort novel! I don't recommend it. You can skip it and go on to the next book without confusion."
1,Dont buy this book,"If you want to learn SQL tuning this is not hte book. I guess the author has just filled the book. All, I learned in the end is use indexes (OK!!!). Using indexes is only one part of SQL tuning. There are other issues which have not been explored at all. It is a sheer waste of money to buy this book. I would rather recommend other fine books by Oracle Press and Prentice Hall on Tuning. Bottomline, Dont buy this book. I would have given it a Zero Star if one was available. It was a waste of my money."
2,Mediocre Effort At Best,"I've been programming with Oracle for two and a half years now. I felt that a ""High Performance"" programming book might be able to help me out, so I opted for this book. While some of the suggestions are helpful, I don't find most of them to be all that special. The basic concept of the book is, ""use Explain Plan"" (ie tune your code) and ""Use indexes when you can"" - Oooh ! That's insightful!Much of the book is wasted space with the author showing the various permutations of his explain plan output. Four sentences of programming suggestions, followed by two pages of output, doesn't make for particularly interesting reading in my world.Granted, the book gives you more, and in better layout than most Oracle texts out there, but I guess I was hoping for more."
4,Sick if you like the D.E,"This is a 2 disk album. The first disk has the D.E's hits made in the studio. The second has his hits made in garages and other underground places. The first CD is sick and is some of the best D.E. that ive heard. The second CD is wack with poor sound quality and not great lyrics. I would have given this CD a 5 star, but the second disk brings its value down."
5,My review is not yet available,I'd like to see the original version ( in French?) I know it is by Editions Arthaud. Please inform me about this version. Is it on a website?
5,great helmet!,I have been looking everywhere for a helmet for my tiny little 18 month old. This helmet is perfect! She has an 18 inch head and it fits her perfectly. It comes with two different size pads for the inside of the helmet. Great buy. I am glad I found it.
4,Great first helmut,"Cute graphis. Great design. Love the visor. As with all bike helmuts, make sure you measure your kids head before buying. This one comes with a set of extra thick pads in addtion to the ones already in the helmut. I find all bike helmuts difficult to adjust and get a proper fit. This one is no exception. My recommendation is to sit your child in their high chair and distract them with their favorite snack. They won't be able to squirm away and the snacks help them tolerate you putting it on and taking it off while you adjust straps and such. Once properly adjusted I was very please with the fit of the helmut. Doesn't slide down my son's head. I know he'll grow out of it fast, but I'm willing to pay the price to keep his cute little noggin' in one piece. Not that I plan on rolling over the Burley bike trailer, but you never can be too safe!"
5,Helmet for infant/toddler,A very nice looking helmet. It fits my Grandson perfectly. It's a sturdy product. I'm so glad I purchased it. My only complaint was the price. I could get a toddlers helmet for $20 to max $25.
4,"A good helmet, I suppose, but it didn't fit my kid's big head. :(","He was only 9 months old when I bought this, but it was too small for him!"
4,Fun ride-on for a 2 - 3 years old,"I bought this during the recent Amazon Toys Sale. The car requires 8 D batteries to operate and 3 AA batteries for the bubble generator in the back. The button to operate the car and the bubble generator is on the right handle bar (throttle) and situate back far enough so if the child just want to push the car manually, it doesn't get push accidentally. The button is sensitive enough so that the 2 years old little finger can operate the car with a slight push. It takes a little while for the bubble to come out, so the child have to travel a distance of couple feet before seeing the bubbles. Overall, my 2 years old enjoy her car a lot for a past few days"
2,Very short life,"These foams are really good both in terms of providing music quality and comfort for your ears, but they don't last long! First of all, they get dirty very quickly, just from being handled (and from your ear canal, no matter now clean it is). I had read somewhere that you can wash them, so I did, but that washed off the coating which gives them shape memory (allows them to stay squeezed when you're inserting them in your ear and expand afterwards). After the washing they'd just expand right after being squeezed, like regular foam does, and hence it was impossible to insert them into my ears anymore. Even if you don't wash them and put up with the dirty look, that coating wears off after a couple of weeks just from handling, which pretty much kills the ear bud.Avoid the frustration and get triple flange sleeves instead. Nothing of the sort can happen to those, plus, you can wash them as much as you want."
2,"cute, but not comforable","I bought these shoes to wear for my nursing job, I thought they were very cute but no what I had thought. When I put them on they didn't fit, the sides of the shoe hits my lateral ankle bone and is uncomforable. So far I havent worn them due to that fact. I dont recommend them."
1,Misrepresentation,I did not realize that this item could only play mini-dvd's and that the selections are minimal.
1,PLEASE GET THE FACTS RIGHT !!!,"""This is among the tiniest DVD format players available"" it states in the last line of the product description, yet its product dimensions state that it weighs 6 pounds . . . more than a bag of sugar . . . I do not think so, would Samsung design something that heavy for kids to lug around & watch a video??? Top that off with 13 pounds for a shipping weight from Amazon's listing and you get retailers charging $19.66/$13.79/$14.59 for shipping costs ???Does this player come with its own pet brick to comfort it during the trip to its new home ???I am amazed that Amazon is forcing us to beware of such tactics while visiting your site . . . don't you want us to feel comfortable with the information/pricing given at each products' site ???Do other shoppers out there not look at shipping costs before you press ""Add to Shopping Cart"" or hit ""1-Click ordering"" ???C'mon Amazon . . . get your act together . . . I love shopping here !!!"
2,Can't find any movies for this,"It is a good item, but you can't find any movies to play on it. So it defeated its purpose in my book."
3,Good size player for child-hard to find movies on mini-discs,"I purchased this as a gift for my 5 year old son and am looking forward to giving it to him for Christmas. However, I only rated it 3 stars because I'm having a terrible time finding very many movies on mini-disc."
4,get this for long flights!,"This is the only video player I have found that runs on regular replacable AA batteries. We travel with kids to England from San Diego so a movie player that dies after 1-2 hours isn't worth the baggage space. This item allows you to bring a pack of batteries and you are set for 10 hours non stop viewing! Big draw back is that it only plays ""mini"" disks which basically means you have to buy your own blank mini disks and then convert your existing dvd/video into your mini disk using software on your pc. If you are up for the tech challenge the results are worth it!"
2,"Odd Mini-DVD format, no auto-off","I bought this as a possible travel DVD player, and misread the features: it doesn't play normal DVDs, only the small ones (""Mini-DVD"") that you can't get any content on. It's not great for kids as it doesn't shut off automatically after a period of no use, so the batteries get drained every time my daughter uses it. I would have given it 1 star, but it includes a nice set of 4 AA rechargeables and charger so I gave it an extra star."
1,very disappointed,"I am disappointed with my last purchase and have tried to contact the seller because no where on the adverisement did it say this was a mini dvd player. It said portable and I was expecting a portable not a mini player which I can do nothing with. Was this false advertisement or was it a mistake? I really don't know the answer to this question because I am not able to reach Ace digital by phone. At times I feel like I was gotten. No matter what time I call this company the recording say that they are closed during the hours of operation that are give. So, at this time I again am very sadden. I do not have the product I thought I was buying."
2,OK,THE MOVIES ARE HARD TO FIND FOR THIS MINI DVD. THE BATTERY LEAKED AFTER A YEAR. SO I HAVE IT USED IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW.
5,Miffy Mania Strikes Again!,"When I think of childhood companions, Miffy and Hello Kitty make that list. This was my favorite ""Miffy"" book when I was young and now that it is popular once more I can read it to my 5 year-old sister-in-law. ""Miffy In The Snow"" is young Miffy's adventure in the lovely winter white powder that all kids adore! Miffy is such a delightful character for any young (or young-at-heart) person! If you have any ankle-biters in your house, ""Miffy"" is sure to please. And even if you don't, ""Miffy"" is sure to bring back some fond memories!"
4,Powerful Reading,Powerful Magic is Powerful reading. I was so lost in the story that I couldn't put the book down. A must read.
2,All it was missing was Barney,"I had suspension of disbelief problems. Many times my reaction to the decisions the hero and heroine made was, ""No one could be that stupid."" I love a well-written romance with characters that don't manufacture their own angst from vapor. Unfortunately, by the time I made it through these 300 pages, I was bored. Turning my boredom into pseudo-horror was the final battle, purportedly between good and evil. It struck me that the author had no idea how to visualize, write about (and possibly believe in) a battle sequence. Barney was there in spirit if not his big purple self. I recommend the book as a very light read for people who multi-task. Read while you cook, clean and solve world hunger. Don't examine it any closer than that."
4,Bring on the next one!,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. I liked reading how Megan traveled (actually was pulled) through time into the year 1072. Kenric, half faerie half human warrior, finds Megan huddled in a corner of his cave freezing. He agrees to help her find her betrothed when she promises Kenric land if he helps her return to where she's from. Not sure if she wants to go back escpecially to her abusive fiance right away Megan doesn't mention she is from the future. Kenric wants land so he may settle down, though he is half faerie he has avoided the faerie world and magic and refuses to use his powers. If he can return Megan to her betrothed he will be able to settle down on the land she has promised him as a human. Only problem is as the book progresses Kenric is more reluctant to return her to her fiance. Their adventure takes them to the faerie world and back. This book is well written and completely enjoyable."
3,Not sure this stands the test of time,"I'm a generation (or two?) removed from this book (a single woman having a career in the late 1960's), so I had some trouble relating to the main character's struggles. At times, I wasn't sure if Atwood was telling a matter-of-fact tale or trying to make a feminist point. Marian loses her ability to eat as she faces a decision about whether to stay with a dependable man or date the quirky anti-establishment freethinker she met at random. The female characters all seemed weak and lacking motivation or direction, so I'm definitely missing something if this is supposed to be fun and ironic. I think this can be a tough novel for people so far removed from the late 1960's to read and understand. I wish I was able to relate, because I admire Atwood as an author, but I just couldn't. Definitely try some of her other work, like The Robber Bride or The Handmaid's Tale, if you are interested in experiencing the more accessible material."
3,"Interesting, but not her best work","This is the fourth of Atwood's books I have read. Though I enjoyed it, I didn't find it to be a page turner like The Blind Assassin (I couldn't put that one down).The symbolism was interesting, but the end of the story seemed anticlimactic. I can't say I cared for the ending; the chain of events was interesting but left me wanting more after I finished. I am not one of those people who needs a tidy ending with all of the issues resolved, but I don't feel like it was strong enough.I think that the story is slightly more tame than her others, but maybe that is the point. This seems like it could be snatched directly from some young woman's diary. I read it at a steady pace. I would recommend it to others, but might suggest other works such as Blind Assassin or The Handmaid's Tale first."
5,Enightening and a superbly written book,"The Edible Woman was a genuine, outstanding book to read. It was rich with irony and metaphors. I couldn't put it down. It made me think about how society can have such an affect on an individual. It made me realize that in a way that is happening to me and everyone. In the book, Marian wasn't able to eat. She was like being ""consumed"" by society."
2,A published Ally McBeal episode.,"I normally love Margaret Atwood's writing, but this novel really lacked something. Maybe I need to be hit over the head with a message, because I breezed through The Edible Woman without getting any of the deep meaning that I hear about from other readers. The book read like an episode of Ally McBeal. The women were portrayed as irrational or always scheming on men. Atwood should have collaborated on this one with Judith Butler for a harder edge."
1,Lackluster,"I've enjoyed most of Margaret Atwood's books but I must say that this book was awful. Very one-dimensional and frankly, boring. The ending was poorly written as well. I actually threw this book in the wastebasket after I finished it so that no one else would have to endure it."
2,Simply dull,"This book wasn't very good. Though skillfully written, I found it dry and not very insightful. It is very focused on gender and I wonder if I wouldn't have enjoyed it more were I a woman. Though frankly, none of the woman I know are this husband obsessed or shallow. At the end of the book I was reading the talking points for students and was shocked to find that aspects of the book are considered a dark comedy. Not once did I ever think, ""How clever"" or ""How morbidly funny"". The metaphors were very heavy-handed and obvious. You never wonder what is going on, it's there in print in front of you. The only thing that isn't clear are the main character's motivation for making herself miserable. We all know (herself included) that there are very few external forces working upon her. Her misery is entirely of her own volition, yet she seems helpless to change her circumstances.I liken the book to a dull version of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. But in print form and without the whimsy and insight."
4,Creativly Eye Opening,This novel quickly gets you interested and involved. I definitly recommend it to anyone trying to make sense out of their lives.
3,not my favourite,I like Margaret Atwood books but The Edible Woman will not be my favourite. I appreciate the mastery of the language - the novel is written with irony and humor and is full of metaphor. I'm sure that for the late 60's it seemed very modern. However it isn't an engaging story and sometimes I had to force my way through this book.
5,"Reader From Muscat, Oman","I never thought I would enjoy a book written by Margaret Atwood because of the lousy impression I had assumed when I would listen to her during interviews. She seemed to have an attitude of distaste towards interview questions and perhaps the Interviewer. However, I had to admit to myself that I often only heard snippets of these interviews and made a poor judgment based on very little information - that's not fair.After reading the sample, I went ahead and bought the ebook version of ""The Edible Woman"". Well, golly gee, was I ever off base! She is a terrific writer!! I enjoyed the rich descriptions of each setting and the well-developed characters as they moved through the interesting storyline. The ending was excellent because I could not have predicted the outcome, making this book a great read from start to finish! (My apologies to Margaret Atwood, fellow Canadian, for my hasty impression after having so little information about you. Bad Canadian, bad, I am)."
3,"Dated, but not bad","Good, but not my favorite Atwood (I like Handmaid's Tale and The Blind Assassin Better). I couldn't help thinking how dated Marian's worries about her marriage seemed, but then this was written in the 1960s. And I really hated Duncan by the end of it."
1,A Monument To Mediocrity.,"I have to admit that I just don't get it. People will rush out in droves and purchase this collection of recycled Chuck Berry riffs and ballads that would make Lionel Ritchie gag while the works of far more deserving artists (say, Marshall Crenshaw) stay on the shelf.No accounting for taste, as the saying goes.Anyway, folks , here it is and just in time for the holidays too! The perfect stocking stuffer for the great unwashed.Get yours now."
2,Another Disappointing Version of What Could Have Been.....,"Another huge disappointment! Those of us raised in the Detroit area and knew of Bob Seger before he went on to national recognition in December 1968, yearn for the day when he will finally put his two local hits, ""East Side Story"" and ""Heavy Music,"" onto a CD, along with the still missing-in-action ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man,"" and create the remaining half of a true Bob Seger's Greatest Hits. This sorry excuse for a Greatest Hits 2 is the very reason companies such as Napster came into existence, so that listeners could download songs and make their own Greatest Hits CDs because the greedy artists wouldn't do it themselves. I recommend that the next time Bob envisions doing a Greatest Hits CD, he simply title it the Bob Seger Anthology and finally give his fans the complete collection which they deserve, spanning his early years to the present!"
1,Unfortunately this is not a REAL CD,"While the musical content of this ""enhanced CD"" is good, please be aware that his ""CD"" will not play on a significant number of CD players. It is not legally a ""compact disc"". If you use your computer as your CD player as I do, you'll find that this CD will only access the ""Turn the Page"" video. You cannot play the audio tracks. I also listen to CD's on my computer at my office.....but guess what? I can't listen to this one. Capitol Records and the RIAA call this an ""enhanced CD"". I have over two thousand CD's in my collection and I call it the ""last CD I will ever purchase."""
3,You Missed A Few,"Combined with Bob's first Greatest Hits album, it's a good collection of his work, but sadly, even after listening to all the tracks on both the first and this second offering of greatest hits, there were some OBVIOUS oversights that beg to be included, replacing some of the lesser known tracks like Manhattan, Sunspot, etc. C'mon! Where's ""Til It Shines"" or ""Feel Like A Number""... or ""Ramblin, Gamblin Man"".... Let's hope if Bob puts out a Greatest Hits 3, he includes some of these lost gems, and doesn't fill the rest of the album with lesser known filler."
2,Forgot some very important songs,Where is Come to Papa? Why wasn't the live Travelin man and Beautiful loser song on here? Why wasn't ramblin gamblin man or Feel like a number included? Bob Seger is a great musician but I feel that the song selection for this CD could have been much much better. Just my 2 cents
3,GRRRRRRRRRR,"Where's ""Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"", ""Even Now"" and ""American Storm""? They couldn't even get it right the second time around. Idiots! I feel sick!"
3,Misses the mark again!!!!,"GH2 is inadequate. Capital seems to be doing Seger (and his fans and future ones) wrong. GH1 was bad enough by including 2 new songs when other songs should have been there: Even Now, American Storm, Brave Strangers, Famous Final Scene, Lock and Load, No Man's Land, Ramblin Gamblin Man, and say, the live version of Fire Lake, but to omit these the second time around is a sin especially when replacing them with 2 new songs, Chances Are, and A New Coat of Paint. If I was new to Seger or have an interest in his music, I would wait for Capital to release a Double CD Set (like an Essentials type set) and forego this CD. Capital are you listening? Do Seger right!!!"
