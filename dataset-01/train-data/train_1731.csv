1,Waste of money,"It didn't work for me. Maybe I was doing something wrong but the little hose and or the bottle kept falling off. I could only get the cleaner to spray by pointing it down, then back up to spray the solution for a few seconds."
2,May depend on your background,"Not interesting, dry and lacks math details. Lacks economic intuition. For me, Hull's book even does a better job explaining Ito's calculus. But Math/Physics guys may like it."
2,No nearly enought detail to be of use.,It is an incomplete treatment of some quantitative financial problems.
2,Not close to the best in its class,"This book is not close to the best in class. It's collecting dust on my bookshelf. There isn't enough practical information to make it a reason to take it off the bookshelf after purchase and a read through. ""Derivatives Markets"" by Robert McDonald is a much better written and more satisfying book. Even the paper quality, cover, and layout are better. The chapters have practical and excellent problem sets. McDonald is also a clearer writer with a better command of the subject."
5,"800,000 trees","50 years ago 800,000 trees were planted by the Israeli government in honor of Pope Pius XII and the 800,000 Jews he and the Catholic church saved from the evils of Nazism. Holocaust survivors and other Jews of the time were grateful to the Catholic church for its role in saving their lives, as are those who are honest and accept truth rather than fiction. It's only the revisionist history fueled by today's rabid anti-Catholics that perverse the truth. Rychlak's book is an unbiased, intelligent, factual account of the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
4,"Pretty much a definitive refutation of the ""silent pope""","Although a history book and consequently hard for me to read, this is extremely well researched and clearly demonstrates the absurdity of the claim that Pius XII was ""silent"" during WWII. In your face, John Cornwell!"
5,Finally something objective!,"A lot of books have bashed Pope Pius XII for not taking a harder line agienst both Hitler and his little buddy El Duche. To stand there and constanly attack the man, probably the most popular Pope of the 20th century with the exception of the 2 John Pauls, is totally without merit. To attack a man for what he DIDN'T do is not history. In my opinion such a tactic lies somewhere between aggitation and slander.Now sit back and ask yourselves what could the Pope have done?A. Openly help to smuggle out jews and others thereby putting himself and the whole population of Rome in dangerB. Arm the Vatican guard? maybe somehow overthrow the German puppet goverment?Or what he really didC. Niether help nor hinder but be willing to look the other way if a priest or a friar took some independent actionIf you want to see another item that deals with this problem check out the Gregory Peck film ""The Scarlet and Black""You did a wonderful job Mr. Rychlak"
2,God damn the popes!,Hitler for pope! To hell with the popes masquerade! Damn you hipocrites with your vain babbling that no one understands. The vain papacy with its thrones and scepters is doomed!
2,2000 Catholic priests held hostage in Dachau,See my review of Susan Zucotti's book.UNDER HIS VERY WINDOW.
5,"Hitler, the War, and the Pope","If you are looking for a well documented historical account of the situation between the Catholic Church and the Third Reich, you will find this book goes straight to the facts, names names, times, places, and events. This book completely shuns sensationalism, has impeccible research, and refutes inferior books such as 'Hitler's Pope' by John Cornwell."
5,Rychlak Is Not A Catholic,"Thoroughly researched, thoroughly reliable. Rychlak has extensive familiarity with primary sources and he sticks to the incontrovertible facts.Please note, in reading some reviews published here, the animosity towards Christianity expressed by several people who obviously haven't read the book. This is a subject that should be approached with a cool head, an acknowledgement of the complexity of the situation, and a willingness to be truthful and fair; Rychlak has done just fine on all counts."
2,Ok literature,This is an ok piece of literature. It is interesting but not really appropriate for young people.
5,The Real Warfare,Excellent on many levels: the mind set of those who really hate the Christian viewpoint and their ignorance of the facts; the description of heaven was outstanding; the description of hell very sobering; and the effects of ignoring God's rules on sexuality and purity. There is hope that minds can change and get it right and have a bright future.
5,The best book I've ever read!,"Deadline by Randy Alcorn is by far the best book I've ever read, excluding the Holy Bible! It gives new perspective to the Bible, and keeps you interested every page of the way! It can change your life if you let it!"
5,Deeply Moving,One of the best books I have ever read. Deeply moving. The descriptions of heaven brought me to tears and the mystery and action were very interesting. I loved this book.
2,Preachin to the choir,"I know this book has a lot of good reviews here on Amazon and only a few bad. However, I do not agree with the positive reviews. I am an avid reader and read mostly Christian fiction. I choose to read fiction as a way to bring adventure and intrigue into my life through a way other than the TV.I found this book to be boring and ""preachy"". The author goes on and on about abortion, teen sex, and the consequences of each. I am a Christian and I don't need a 300+ page book to tell me of all the arguments against abortion and pre-marital sex. This is like preaching to the choir, if I wanted to read on the subject I would buy a NONFICTION book on those subjects.The plot is blurred many times in this book, not knowing if the author is wanting to solve the mystery, convince the ""liberals"" abortion is murder, or convince teens how wrong sex is before marriage.In a nutshell, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to be entertained!"
3,Good but not a must read.,I thought the beginning of the book pulled you in but it left you waiting for more. The book carrys you on a interesting journey and leads you to an abrupt stop. I felt like the author did have time to come up with a decent ending so he rushed through the ending. I felt cheated. The author draws an interesting picture of what heaven is like. The imagery alone makes the book work the read.
3,A Bit Too Cumbersome,"The plot to this book is intriguing, and that is what has kept me reading. However, I feel like the author spends way too much time developing topics that don't add that much to the story. Unfortunately I've found myself skipping over fairly large sections just to try to keep the story going.Too much time is spent ""on the soapbox"" if you will. I actually agree with a lot of his viewpoints but the fact remains that this is a novel, not a thesis! I'm reading it for enjoyment, not a theological/political dissertation!I still haven't finished the book yet, really trying to, and I hope the ending isn't disappointing after wading through all the extra stuff to get there!"
2,Not a Must Read Book,"I just read Safely Home, and fell in Love with it. So when I read Deadline, it started off really good, but then it lost me. The plot was blurred many times. I would not recommend this book.I found myself skipping over fairly large sections just to keep the story going. I haven't finished it yet. I guess I'm looking forward to the end."
5,"Soul-Stirring, Faith-Strengthening Fiction","This book had a profound impact on me spiritually. I've enjoyed Alcorn's non-fiction writings very much but have to say that this stirred my soul and strengthened my faith and opened my eyes more than nearly any other fiction book I've read (Frank Peretti's books are up there). The multiple story lines keep things moving and interesting and the insights into the spiritual realm and heaven/hell are very real and helped me see heaven and the spiritual realm in a new way which gives me great hope. Great stuff, on to #2 in the series..."
2,Fiction or non-fiction?,"Even using a work of fiction to speculate on ideas about heaven, which God, in His wisdom has not shared with us in the Bible, is unwise and may be damaging to the faith of some . God's revelations are perfect and when this author adds to them, even in a novel he can cause others to dwell on things that are not true as though they are. Even if Mr. Alcorn's speculations about heaven and life after death prove to be true (and we won't know in this life), is he wiser than God who kept silent on the matter? Consider why God commands us not to worship ""pictures"" of Him. (See the first two commandments.) I would not recommend this book to anyone, believer or unbeliever."
4,Deadline,"This book in the series seems to move more slowly than the first one did. Still good writing, good views from Heaven."
4,Mostly Good Story,"I enjoyed this book, it was mostly interesting, but did get a little wordy. I did disagree the theology he presented in the story a bit, although it was in line with mainline thinking today. I do recommend the book and appreciating Mr. Alcorn writing it."
5,Best novel I've ever read in one can't-put-it-down session!,"THE Perfect gift for your pastor or any other christian leader.If you like Peretti's books you will find that Deadline! surpasses anything you've read by a Christian author.Randy Alcorn, best known for his non-fiction pro-life appologetics, has written a masterful suspense novel which he uses as a frame work to expose Planned Parenthood and media bias toward the anti-life abortionist's viewpoint.Mr. Alcorn also manages to show how the media and educators have helped to distort America's views toward 'tolerence' and away from truth.The book also has the most vivid and beautiful word picture of the after-life which has been written since St. Paul put down his pen.This book will make you think - don't start reading this one at night if you have to go to work the next morning because you will not be able to put it down until you reach the nerve-tingling ending"
5,A book that makes you think,"This book is not for the politically correct! It makes you think about issues that many of us try not to think about, but it presents them wrapped in an engrossing story. I loved the book so much I ran right out to buy the next one. The views of heaven have changed my whole perspective about it. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is not afraid to buck the political correctness of our world."
2,Can you say...Get to the point...,"I couldn't put the book down long enough! The only reason I bothered to finish the book was out of curiosity. I needed to know that there was really a plot or main point to the story. I never did figure out if there was either. I admit he has some beautiful ideas about the after-life, but the amount of useless details you must read through to get to anything interesting was ridiculous. I think about two hundred pages could have been cut out and I would not have missed anything. I've read phone books that held my interest about as much as this book did."
4,Unexpectedly Insightful,"I've not read a fiction book since I was in Junior High! After downloading a Kindle App to my phone, I randomly searched for a cheap (cost-effective) book to use as my ""first download."" DEADLINE was only $0.89 so I figured I would'nt be out much if it was disappointing. I was not disappointed. The descriptions of Heaven and it's inhabitants were moving in a way that I have not experienced in quite some time. The dialogue between Finney and Zyor was insightful and welcoming. The stances on many of the ""touchy"" modern-day subjects Christian face were empowering and encouraged me to examine and bolster my positions. I haven't even mentioned the murder-mystery yet which kept me guessing until the very end. The plot twists came fast and furious; however, they were still easy to follow. I loved it and just became a fan of Randy Alcorn."
4,Kept my interest,The book was hard to get into at the beginning but I really enjoyed it as I went along. I'm not used to reading such a large book but it kept my interest. As the book went on the stories got more interesting and the ending was good. I would like to see the author write a book on a person going to hell and then at the end of the book make it all a dream. That would keep the reader on the edge of their seat until the end and then drop it when it was all a dream. I thought this book was going to have that ending but I was suprised that it was what it was. Randy Alcorn will still be one of my reads in the future.
5,Alcorn Rocks,"I'm working my way through all of Alcorns books. I'm not generally a book reader but I'm hooked on these. I'm finishing up on ""Dominion"" now and will strat on ""Heaven"" next. He does a great job."
5,Excellent read!,"Randy Alcorn has a style of writing that is both realistic and attention-getting. I love this book! It caught my interest right away and kept it! I love books that are entertaining, suspensful, and thought-provoking. This is one of them! It challenged me on a very deep level."
4,only part way into it but it is very good,I have read the books years ago but I have to say sitting in traffic has become a lot more fun. I am looking forward to the next two books on CD!
5,Great book.,I am a Randy Alcorn fan and this is a book that will hold your interest to the last page.
3,Just ok,"This book started out really good, then got boring and monotonous. I could tell the outcome after reading 1/3 of it. After trying Edge of Eternity (which was awful and totally out-there) then this one, won't purchase another Randy Alcorn, although the message is good but should be much more to the point and move faster for a novel to keep the reader interested."
4,Excellent warm mist humidifier,"This humidifier allows you to select the level of humidity you want, or set a timer to run for up to 10 hours. It automatically shuts off when the tank is empty. It is easy to clean and refill. It does need to be refilled each day because the tank only holds enough water for about 10 hours. The lid to this tank is easier to remove and replace than on our other humidifier. It comes with a remote control, which might be handy for some, but we don't use it. It puts out a nice flow of warm moist air that feels so good on my throat during a winter night.Don't let the word ""humidifier"" turn you away from this product. It is nothing like the old-style wick humidifiers that are unhealthy for you. This received excellent marks from Consumer Reports."
1,Lasted one season,Plugged it in the following year and it was dead. As this was the 3rd warm-air humidifier that crapped out on me after a few years I went ahead and bought a Holmes cool-mist humidifier: time will tell if I made the right decision.
4,An account of a youth captured by the Indians in the 1700s.,"As a direct descendant of Christian Fast, I was very interested in this book. The facts, as I know them, are accurate. The author, an amateur historian, does an excellent job of recreating those times. Unfortunately, the writing is not a good as the research but it is still a fascinating account of an interesting period of history."
5,Women of the Bible come to life!,"Francine Rivers continues her series of Lineage of Grace, with the story of Bathsheba, one of the best examples we have of the power of God's forgiveness. Bathsheba's early life is described, from her admiration of David to her love for her grandfather Ahitophel. She grows up and unwillingly becomes the wife of Uriah, still clinging to her love for David. The Biblical events of her affair with David are narrated, along with the guilt they feel from betraying Uriah. Even after Bathsheba and David are married, their troubles do not end. Family intrigue becomes a way of life and a tragic death mars their marriage. Bathsheba learns in a painful way the price of disobeying God, but as the book continues we see her redemption and her realization that her first love and loyalty must be forher Heavenly Father."
3,Not into it.,A thinly veiled harlequin romance. We are set up to rain sympathy on poor poor Bathsheba...The victim of love. A very predictible book. What a major disappointment.
2,Poor Condition,"This book was in poor condition when I recieved it, alot of tape and plastic all over, written in some parts."
4,Wonderful,"I enjoyed this fictional tale of King David and Bathsheba. Their love story was one for the ages. David, as God's chosen leader of the Isrealites, is painted in very human terms. We can understand his motivations as well as those of Bathsheba. Even though their love for each other was very real, the acts they committed to enable their love, caused them to sin.Their betrayal had many unintended repercussions: her husband's death, her disownment from her family, their son's death. It really showed how one sin can cause the innocent to suffer.Their story also allowed the reader to see that although they sinned, when they repented God forgave them and blessed them. Their story is one of love, redemption and hope. The Seek and Find section also offered additional insight into how reconciliation with God offers hope for all sinners."
2,Blah blah blah,"I enjoyed Prozac Nation, and thought it would be interesting to see where our Elizabeth ended up. I was curious to find out about her ""major depression"" and story of recovery. However, I realized sometime through the book that our author sounded like she quite possibly has Borderline Personality Disorder (I have a parent who is), and upon researching-- it was confirmed.As I got further into the book, my dislike for the protagonist grew.Finally I was disgusted by her behavior and more so, attitude, and after mulling it over for a couple days, stopped reading.I read a lot of memoirs, and like gritty, dark, HUMAN Stories where someone overcomes hardship and triumphs.This was just the long-winded ramblings of an overgrown adolescent, a spoiled and narcissistic woman, full of misery and complaints-- and self-created hardships, stuck on repeat. Shameful to admit, I stopped Caring what happened to her!Like nails on the chalkboard, so are the days of Elizabeth Wurtzel's life."
3,"A Bit Too ""Wordy""","This author knows about a million words, I had my dictionary out the whole time... Aside from that, sometimes Elizabeth seems to be trying to convince herself that she really IS smart, pretty, etc. Still, an excellent memoir and deep look inside the mind and heart of an addict. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, others might find it insufferable. At times it's hard to differentiate between her candor and ego, though. Loses one star because of too much wordiness, although I would highly recommend it to recovering addicts."
4,Mostly a Download,"If a book can be written in ""real time,"" this one was. There isn't really any direction: It is simply a download written in whatever order things happened to occur. Actually, I liked this book; I thought Elizabeth Wurtzel had something to say, and she did a good job of getting her thoughts down in writing. However, I would be slow to recommend More, Now, Again to anybody else. I do not think it is a book that would appeal very much to the majority of people."
1,I Hope It Helps Somebody...,"But in this book, about the author's recent hardcore drug addiction, Elizabeth Wurtzel comes across as self-absorbed as any active junkie. Plus, the writing's poor--and the value judgments are distasteful.Ms. Wurtzel congratulates herself with a sense of histrionic gravity that approaches a Sarah Bernhardt death scene for being clean 4 years (or so) now. Of course, it's all about *her*. And *she* is boring. Plus, the ""I've beat it"" sentiment does no one any good--I've heard that 4 years, for a hard drug addict, is not very much. And she's *selling* this, for profit!Hey, I'm sure Elizabeth Wurtzel *is* clean--or I would hope so. I hope this book helps someone struggling with the demons she relates. But is she sane, happy, ""sober""?Here's my advice--deal with the issues where they should be dealt with, and move on, like, say, Denis Johnson. And one hopes Ms. Wurtzel's now clear imagination can create another book--this time, about someone other than herself."
4,good read,"I have been fascinated by Elizabeth since reading Prozac Nation. It's hard to imagine going through life like she has-to acknowledge what you are capable of (brilliance while also being narcissistic)and then still self destructing. They way that she writes it's as if you are there with her while all of her life is happening. There are many disturbing things that she does like snort Ritalin (who the hell would think of that??), have an affair with a married man, treat her friends & coworkers like they are dispensible. I hope for her sake at this point in her life she has come to grips with her addiction and continue to get on with her life. She has tons to contribute to our society if she will just allow herself to."
1,"No, No, No....","I'll keep this short. Read the quotes Wurtzel made regarding 911 before buying this, or any Wurtzel book. Having enjoyed Prozac Nation, I was horrified to read her comments regarding the tragedy. I don't know if they were made for shock value, or if she was simply stating how she truly felt. Any admiration I had for her as a writer, has been erased by my disgust upon reading these excerpts. This may not be the place for political commentary, but I want people to be informed before contributing a dime to this woman. By the way, I'm a liberal, and a firm supporter of women's rights. How very sad, Elizabeth."
5,Drugs and Addiction,"Rather than focusing on depression as Elizabeth Wurtzel did in her first novel, Prozac Nation; More, Now, Again: A Memoir of Addiction records her experiences as a drug addict. The novel touches on experimentation with several different substances and displays a gradual decline into dependency upon a Ritalin prescription and other speedy drugs. The books real life feel and explicit content keep the readers attention through the entire novel."
4,"Self-absorbed? Yes, but I still liked it!","Yes, Wurtzel's book is like a train wreck. Yes, she's completely self-absorbed. And yes, she's egotistical as all get-out. Despite these faults (and maybe a little because of them), I loved the book. Wurtzel opens herself wide... to criticism, to scrutiny, to the peering eyes of her readers. She might be annoying and conceited, but she's honest, and her writing style's entertaining to boot. I couldn't put the book down, and I've read it several times besides. As long as you can put up with her self-indulgent nature, you'll like the book."
1,Phooey,"Reading this book was one of the most agonizing ten minutes of my life. You get a little ways in, start skimming, see it's she same old whine, whine, whine, and then toss it across the room, run after it, and begin stomping. Wurtzel is talentless, pathetic, and gives a whole new meaning to the word ""narcissism."" I can't imagine why anyone would want to read her drivel. She's one of those people who are famous for being famous, so I guess we'll be subjected to more books like this ... but I won't. She gives depression a bad name, and I know a little bit about depression, being subject to it myself. I only wish she'd been INSIDE the World Trade Center instead of just fairly close. She says she enjoyed the show from the outside. Think how much more exciting it would have been even closer."
1,Enough already!,"Can't the author just shut her self-entitled pie hole? I'm normally not this obnoxious, but this twit is too much."
5,The living Nightmare,"Wurtzel leaves no stone unturned as she describes her own addictions, whether they be to Ritalin, Coke, or the seemingly endless chsain of men she cant seem to find true love with. She goes into explicit details about the ""glamorous"" life of an addict....the vomiting, the shakes, the missed appointments, and the friends who keep telling her, ""you need help'. If you have ever known an addict, you will see some familair things going on in the author's life. This book is raww, and real....from the horrors of withdrawl, to the pointlessness of rehab, we see the story of an unhappy, sucessful girl....Great read, recommended."
5,Not for earthlings....,"First of all, Wurtzel is an excellent writer. More, Now, Again is a memoir of her addiction. So like most memoirs, if you haven't actually lived through similar experiences, you are only getting the story while ""attempting"" to understand the feelings. Addiction is a very complicated thing, and most likely if you are not an addict yourself, you will not ID with Wurtzel. Now, for those in recovery, this book is a MUST read! It dives into the true desperation and and denial of addiction, and you can feel her pain every step of the way.I've read many memoirs, especially those of people in recovery. More, Now, Again is top notch, and provides strengh and hope to those who have lived through the dark shadows of drug addiction.Once again, if you're not an addict and are bashing this book in any way, it's simply because you just cannot understand something as deep as this without living it. Sorry to all you normal people! =D"
5,An AMAZING book,"I couldn't put this book down. Elizabeth Wurtzel is an amazing writer. She just pulls you in when she writes (about herself in particular). She is fascinating, brilliant, witty, and honest. If you haven't read this or her first book, Prozac Nation, you are missing out!!!"
1,Shallow and Stupid...,"both for the contents of the book and the author. It could have been a contender, though. The basic skeletal structure was there for an interesting and maybe informative read. As for Ms. Wurtzel? Ayn Rand, she ain't."
4,Addicts ARE self-absorbed!,"After reading complaints about how self-absorbed Ms. Wurtzel is, I felt the need to point this out... ALL ADDICTS ARE SELF ABSORBED. I have much experience in my life with addiciton, and give any addict a book to write, it will be about their pain, their stories, what they experienced. Addiction is about an individual. I found her story fascinating, because it proves that no matter how much money you have or support you have, until you hit rock bottom, until you are ready to give up and let go, you will not recover. It will not work. Elizabeth is an example of how hard addiction is, and her book was a good case study on the workings of a selfish addict, which is what an addict is."
1,Enough Already,"Would that it were possible to give zero stars. Yet another journey into narcissism by Ms. Wurtzel who is, in addition to being completely self absorbed, a really pitiful human being. Elizabeth Wurtzel's mind, and thus her book, is pure dross."
1,puhleese,"This woman would be pitiful if she were not so apallingly arrogant. She is genuinely sick; however, one cannot feel sorry for her in the face of her meanspirited remarks. She has had every advantage, yet she obviously learned nothing at Harvard. She boasts that she is the leading non-fiction writer of her generation and that she is the 'prettiest girl she knows."" This is good because no one else thinks so. She may have a ph.d. in the reader's digest or in junk food, but she certainly is not worldly, knowledgeable or scholarly. I haven't read one good review of any of her books. How in heaven's name could this sloppy work have been published? The publishers were evidently high as well. I feel sorry for the poor trees that sacrificed their lives for the paper."
1,It's hard.......,"to imagine someone more self-involved than Wurtzel. I am sure it's possible, but I wouldn't want to be there to witness it. Only to be purchased as a learning tool for angsty children of privilege -- ""this could be you..... and it would be awful......"""
4,"Say what you want, it's a page-turner.","I don't disagree with negative reviewers who think E. Wurtzel's oeuvre is repetitive. (When is she going to straighten her life out, even just a little?) But whatever you think about her immaturity and apparent lack of curiosity about anything outside of her own suffering, this book manages to be a real page-turner. And that's no small feat. I read it in a day and barely put it down once. I'm a memoir addict, but still. Wurtzel may not know how to resolve a conflict (in her books or in her life), but she's very good at building narrative tension and drama."
1,A Memoir of Self-Absorption,"The only distinction of this memoir is that it is unusually self-absorbed even for an addict. The author demonstrates a complete lack of empathy for those around her. This personality must have been edited out of Prozac Nation which is a ""self-portrayal"" of a very different woman.This book is boring, boring, boring. I contemplated a few hits of Ritalin to help get me through it."
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read!,"This girl needs to stop writing, she has lost the touch she never had. The book lacks any true points. I am waiting for her next book to be about her struggle with no-doze."
2,I certainly didn't want more,"After finishing this book, I was left wondering why Elizabeth Wurtzel is considered one of our best young writers. I loved ""Prozac Nation,"" but since then, Wurtzel has revealed herself to be a very pompous and marginally talented writer. I got very sick of hearing, in this book, how ""smart"" and ""pretty"" the author is, and began to feel like ""More, Now, Again"" was a therapy project assigned to get Wurtzel to realize what a lovely person she is deep down. This book is neither enlightening nor especially well-written; if you're looking for an honest, powerful memoir about drug addiction, read James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces"" instead. That way, you can avoid this arrogant, self-aggrandizing display."
4,Saints,"I was very happy with this product. I bought it as a gift for someone and they liked it. It came on time too, which is great since it was around Christmas time."
2,"Worked fine for a year, then nothing","So this DVD worked fine for about a year, then nothing. A little light on the front, but despite turning it off and on, leaving it unplugged, etc., it never worked again. When it did work, it did play Region 1 and Region 2 DVDs just fine. Those were the only region DVDs I had. So I guess this is an ok unit if you can find it cheap and expect to dispose of it after a while. But I really long for the days when electronics didn't always break. Now it seems that every brand has a really short life before you have to buy another..."
1,JWIN - multi region dvd player,"Ok, I don't think I did ask for too much: at the very least a region 4 player (Yes I do have Australian - pal DVD's). and yes I am in the US of A land of NTSC Telly... so can you watch a multi-region dvd in your lounge? the answer is NO... it just does not work.That is all there is to say... so try something else instead."
2,not as pictured,The Item I received has the female end in the middle rather then on and end so I am now going to need a 90 degree elbow to make this work.
2,Not the group I thought it was,"I received an e-mail suggesting this album to me because I bought other Sing Off albums, so I thought this was Committed from that show. It is NOT. The album is OK, but not good enough I would have boought it."
5,A beautiful book overflowing with luscious imagery & warmth,"What a powerful talent the poet turned author is. Frances Mayes' imagery is truly evocative - compelling you out of your current surroundings and into the tumbling and fascinating world of Tuscany.Read this, you'll love it!!"
2,A boring and tedious account about life in Tuscany,"A lackluster and tedious account about purchasing and renovating an old residential structure in Tuscany by a university professor from San Fracisco and her nearly non-existent husband (at least from the book's account). This author is so consumed with self (you'll hear about her job as departmental chair...) that you never get any sense of what life really might be like in this part of Italy. Except for a few interesting food recipes, this book is not a good use of your time. If you want local flavor in sleepy western Europe. Read Peter Mayle."
4,I want to SEE it!,"Very pleasant and interesting reading. My daughter, Bates graduate in Art History, wants to go visit! Glossary of terms -- both Italian and cooking -- would be helpful for those of us who really know nothing about either! Most importantly, where can we view pictures -- the cover illustration does not come close to the description within -- a pictorial essay would be a delight -- before & afters, and the like!"
5,I Loved It.,"I read the book twice. I love the vivid descriptions of the Tuscany countryside, the recipes and the people. One of my favorite books. It's an adventure and you're along for the ride."
1,"Boring, no plot","Don't waste your money! I listened to this audiobook and was so glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend my money on it. I had heard that the movie was good and started the whole ""Tuscan trend"" here in the USA. The book basically features long, tedious descriptions of renovation, repairs, stone wall building, water well drilling, farming, cooking. There is no plot, and Ms Mayes seems to socialize only with expatriate Americans, some of whom have fled Rome for Tuscany. I certainly don't see the appeal. Can I rate it no stars?"
4,delightful escape to Italy,"I read this book after seeing the movie. I had heard they were very different, and they are. The movie has turned her memoirs into a narrative and taken several liberties with her life and friends, but I must admit that I enjoyed both. The book is a memoir and not a novel, and it mainly covers the purchase and renovation of an old villa near Cortona that Mayes purchased. Much of the charm and ""action"" of the book is how Mayes learns to do things the Tuscan way, inevitably by trial and error. Her delight in Tuscany and the people of Cortona make it easy to see why she was so accepted by the people. Mayes writes with warmth and a poetic sense of the sites, sounds, tastes and customs of Tuscany. This is a great book to curl up with and while away an afternoon."
3,a meandering journey...,"True, this book will inspire you to live simpler and plant basil in your garden. However, the unlikable author is from an obviously privilaged background (childhood memories of her familys cook/housekeeper and seamstress), and is quite self-absorbed in her charmed life. It leads me to wonder why such a ""worldly"" and ""educated"" woman such as Mayes would balk at buying a live rabbit from an Italian market and criticize women (in Italy) who wear the fur from slaughtered ""wild animals"". She has no qualms, however, about consuming veal on a seemingly daily basis. The book is less about the re-construction of an old villa but focuses more upon the making and consuming of food, Mayes tunnel-vision through Italy and Italian customs, and the preoccupation with herself while she does so. A flight of fancy and afternoon read, at best."
2,Basta cosi!! (Enough already!!),"OK, we all love Italy. We adore Tuscany. Now can we get on with life?The book started off with charming descriptions of life in paradiso, but when Frances waxes oh-so-eloquently about the finding the perfect tomato like 25 times, I found myself yelling, ""per l'amor del cielo - for the love of god - eat the f**king tomato already!!"
3,Good book about Italy,"Needed to replace the library book that my dog chew up (oops!), so bought this book online. It gives a good flavor of Italy during the author's time there, and I enjoyed her style of writing."
5,Perfect driving companion,"These CDs are wonderful. Frances Mayes speaks to the heart of the armchair traveler.. The story of moving to,Italy and restoring an old villa is full of humor, surprises, beauty, great food, and scenery to swoon over. She's a poet and a literature professor so the writing is good, and full of insight. She's a comforting writer, too...she likes decorating, gardening, cooking and eating. Highest recommend!"
2,"could not even finish, no plot",I had hoped that I would read the book and quench my thirst to visit Italy. All I was left with was the feeling that I am glad there will be no remodeling in my near future. I didn't know it was possible to describe something so mundane and boring. I was dying for something to happen.
2,Book is ok...author's personality most painful part of book,"This book served its purpose...while on a trip in Tuscany, I was able to get into the book because I could really picture the scenes that the author describes. I liked the insight into little things like food names, locations, customs, etc etc. But this author romanticized everything and while she claimed to know that she was doing this, I found her perspective incredibly annoying and would not like to run into her in San Francisco (or Tuscany)."
3,Not a good audio book,If you want to enjoy this book I recommend reading it--don't listen to the audio book. I'm not sure why publishers invite authors to read their own books because very few do it successfully. Frances Mayes wrote an entertaining book but her voice is as flat as a freeway in Kansas. She seems to think she is reading Beat poetry with her droning monotone and hard emphasis on every random third or fourth word. The tone at the end of every sentence stays level as if the whole book is a poem with no punctuation. The sentences never end in a down tone like they do in normal speach. This is enough to drive the listener insane.
1,sterile,"In all that clutter of words do you think she could spare at least one kind or loving word for her husband (or lover) Ed? Working, working, working...to enjoy what? Things outside themselves or maybe each unto him or herself, but certainly not each other."
2,Bit of Disappointment,"Am about halfway through the book and struggling to finish it. I'm not sure what I don't like about it, but I get the sense that Ms. Mayes is a little condescending toward her Italian hosts, the citizens of Cortona.I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but it certainly wasn't so much about the remodelling of her 2nd home. You win some you lose some. I also bought Romer's book, so maybe that will be more what I want: food and wine and authentic living...not just some bourgeois lady who bemoans the troubles of Martha Stewart."
2,"Wherever you go, there you are","The reader-reviewers from Pennsylvania and Cambridge (above) reflect my impressions exactly. If you want to get to know Italians and Italy (short of spending a very long time there), read Tim Parks, Barbara Grizzutti Harrison, E. M. Forster. If you want recipes, read Marcella Hazen. If you want to read a really delightful travel memoir, read At Home in France, by Anne Barry."
4,Romantic Chronicles Will Appeal,"Having nothing whatsoever to do with the disappointing Diane Lane film of the same name, this is an enjoyable collection of essays from a recreational ex-patriot's simple, domestic adventures in the Tuscany countryside. It even contains some practical, fun recipes for those inclined to Italian cuisine (I'm a bit of a chef myself--so this was my favorite part of the book).Appropriately sentimental and obviously educated, the author's voice comes through distinctly in every chapter. Unfortunately, that voice is often pretentious (as the French would say LE TROP!)and would shake me away from the reverie of particular passages. But we can forgive her over-the-top gushing quickly enough a page or two later.All in all, this is a popular, modern classic travel memoir sure to especially please Tuscan-philes."
3,Interesting- but poorly written.,"Although I enjoyed this book, I found it poorly written. I was surprised to discover that the author actually TEACHES in UNIVERSITY. Since I acquired my degree in a US University that actually REQUIRES that one know how to write, this scares me!! I DID enjoy her food experiences. And, to those who rally against that in the book, you really do NOT understand Italy. Italy is all ABOUT food! If you visit Italy on a diet, what a waste of a trip!"
1,It sure isn't the movie version!,"Having seen and enjoyed the movie years ago, I was intrigued to get the whole story. Books usually tell it so much better. This one doesn't. So, if you're looking to read a better version of the movie, this isn't it - go buy the script.There's no drama, no character development, no humor, no love story! It's just imagery, imagery, imagery. BORING. It was good for putting me to sleep, but that's about it. Here's the cliffsnotes version of the book: Two professors go to Italy, buy a house, fix it up, visit it every summer and Christmas and serve lots of dinners to lots of other people, all who have no story to tell either. You also get a lot of descriptions of doorways and vegetables. There, you've read it!Whoever wrote the script for the movie was a genius to find a way to make something interesting out of this SNOOZEFEST! Save your money, go rent the movie."
4,"A Poetic Fantasy, for the Real Thing Read As the Romans Do","I enjoyed this book for its simplicity yet Mayes seemed quite naive to the complexities of life in Italy and to the Italian people. A much deeper, more accurate account of the Italians and what its really like to be there, I would highly recommend As the Romans Do: The Delights, Dramas and Daily Diversions of Life in the Eternal City written by Alan Epstein, who is a full time resident of Rome with his wife and two sons.I couldn't say it better than the Philadelphia Inquirer who wrote about As the Romans Do in this Sunday's (April 23) Travel Section: ""Whether discoursing on the excellent cuisine or the historical foundations of the predominant habits and niceties of civil intercourse, Epstein captures the heady atmosphere of Rome so completely as to make this book essential for anyone who would understand [Italy] before heading there."""
2,zzZZzzZzzZZzzz.... blah blah blah....,"Snoooooooze. Where to even begin? I love the movie. I saw the movie before I even knew it was (very loosely) based on a book. I figured, if I loved the movie so much, I should really LOVE the book, right? WRONG!What a boring, self-centered memoir. I'm all about memoirs - especially ones that take place in Italy (example: Marcus of Umbria, Extra Virgin). This one was a true snooze fest. It was all - look at me, blah blah, look at my wonderful house, blah blah, look at my perfect life, blah blah blah. I couldn't even finish this book. I felt the author was so self-absorbed and just annoying, and it really surprised me that I felt this way.Maybe one day I'll try to pick it up again and give it another shot, but for now, I'll just pop in the DVD if I'm in the mood for a little Tuscany!"
1,Almost unbearable to listen to,"I'm sure this writer is a very nice person, but she should NOT have been the reader on this book. There are some Southern accents that are musical and lovely, but this one is nasal, twangy, and worst of all, just deadly monotonous. No matter how lyrical the words are, the reading is a flat drone that makes it almost impossible to even understand what she's talking about some of the time. All sense of the magic and beauty of the place she's describing is gone. Compared, say, to Peter Mayle's own reading of his book ""A Year in Provence,"" which is utterly delightful, this audio book is shudderingly bad."
2,It could have been promising!,"Under the Tuscan Sun provides with a few fragmentary glimpses into Italian life but unfortunately, having grown up in Italy I can tell it fails to grasp the heart, spirit, culture and true essence of Italy. Still, F.Mayes is a pretty good writter and she could have written a great book if she had placed Italy in the Center of the story instead of focusing excessively on herself, her opinions, her house, her taste ... Also, a touch of humour like Peter Mayle's would be useful. Unfortunately, Ms Mayes takes herself and everything about her life extremely seriously, whereas Mr Mayle has a noble humbleness that renders a humorous view on life possible ! If you'd like to learn more about F.Mayes, her house, and her taste on food, then this is the book for you; however, if you wish to read about genuine Italy, another book would be more advisable, even Goethe's travels to Italy written ages ago !"
1,Self-Indulgent and Tedious,I agree with those who are stumped by this book's popularlity.It was not well-written: minute descriptions of trival things make fortedious reading. Mayes comes across as very self-indulgent in assuming that her personal life--one without much incident--could interest others. I got about a third of the way through the book and had to put it down. It's not a good sign for a book when one suspects that the writer's motivation for writing it was solely to pay off the bills she had incurred in renovating her house. Peter Mayle and Tim Parks are far better at this genre.
3,Slightly pretentious,"I read this book on my annual trip to Tuscany, and while the author captured the beauty and magic of this part of the world, it also left a bad taste in my mouth. There was a touch of pretention and superiority to her voice..she seemed busy tasting wines and making phoney comments about their quality while the East European laborers did the bulk of the renovation. I do not doubt her love and passion for Tuscany but I also felt she implied that anyone can take a plunge this drastic if they have the same drive as her, and that simply is not the case - buying a villa in Tuscany is not necessarily a tangible option for the majority of us, regardless of how much we love the idea."
1,Shallow and Pretentious,"This is a horrid book, badly written, poorly edited, and tedious to read. There are endless descriptions of the things she buys, the food she eats, her boyfriend Ed's muscles, and the hardship she endures having to schlep back to her bayside house in boring old San Francisco. We only get Italy filtered through the self-absorbed eyes of Ms. Mayes, a thing she herself complains about of D.H. Lawrence: ""I forgive him now and then when he totally disappears from the text and just writes what he sees."" Hmmmm.Particularly offensive were her observations about Roman Catholic saints: ""Oh, here is where they put their awe"", and ""here is where they put there memories and wants"" as if she is some 19th century anthropologist speaking of a primitive culture far beneath herself. What arrogance. Well, Ms.Mayes, I know where to put this book - in the recycling bin, in the hope that it will be reborn as blank paper in the typewriter of a real writer."
2,under the tuscan sun audio cd abridged by frances mayes,"i found the story line very good, but they really needed to find a different person as a voice for the audio. not much flare to the story as it was read and i'm sure it would have been alot more interesting with a different reader. i listen to lots of books on audio, it surely could have been better."
2,"re: the audio version..read in a twangy, dull monotone.","I looked forward to the audio version of Under the Tuscan Sun, but after just 5 minutes, I knew I had made a mistake. I would suggest listening to a portion of Under the Tuscan Sun before purchasing it. It is read in a monotonous, heavily accented manner which becomes annoying pretty quickly. Too bad! Toujours Provence is much more enjoyable if you're looking for something along these lines."
3,"GO BUY ""A YEAR IN PROVENCE"" INSTEAD","Unfortunately I read Tuscan Sun before I read ""A Year in Provence"" by Peter Mayle. Tuscan Sun appears to be quite a rip off of Mayle's book. Mayle's book is quite wonderful and is lacking the self-pitying, superior attitude that Tuscan Sun has. So I would recommend skipping this book and going directly to A Year in Provence."
2,Just Awful,"If only I hadn't seen the movie first - which although it wasn't that great a movie still gave me a preconceived idea of what the book would be about. If only the author hadn't mentally wandered off all the time on this tangent and that instead of sticking with the trials, tribulations, and fun of falling in love with an old ruin of a house and bringing it back to life. If only I had been able to finish the book... I read to the middle of the book and finally gave up. It just wasn't interesting."
1,Under the Tuscan Sun,"I bought this book from Border's because I wasn't sure I would have time to see the movie. The book has Diane Lane on the front making one believe this book is ""something"" like the movie. It is nothing like the movie. I was very disappointed and returned the book."
4,Read if you dare to dream...,"This book is a magical account through the eyes of one woman. Though i live in the U.S., I know quite a few Italians now living here, and none are like those described in the book. There are many generalizations made about the Italians, however i don't think they are meant as stereotypes. And many of the accounts seem like they're coming from a tourist, which basically is what she is. A 6-month-a-year-tourist. If you want light reading that's dreamy, sultry, and romantic, then this is a great read. If you're looking for a history of the Italian people in a true context, then call your local travel agent, and plan your own trip to Italy. We would all write this book differently, but i can appreciate one persons view point, unlike some of the other reviewers listed below me."
3,Okay on the Food!,"This author was very descriptive in the locations and her house and, most especially, in the local cuisine. It makes me want to go to Italy to try the fresh veggies and pasta - and I shall never look at olive oil the same. But the book was twice as long as it needed to be and got to be boring. Enough with the food - we need more details about the people."
4,Insight into the American visitor in Italy,"I read this book while studying architecture in Italy and it was quite enjoyable because as I was reading the book, I was actually seeing this world unfold before my eyes. Anyone who plans to travel to Tuscany or Italy should definitly have this on their nightstand. As should anyone who would love to live vicariously through the author as she explores the wonders of purchasing and restoring a Tuscan villa."
4,It's about finding and reveling in happiness,"Only the cynical would not enjoy this charming book. I loved it! I've never read a book that made me feel so strongly about enjoying and appreciating my life and having the courage to go after happiness. It's vivid discriptions awaken the senses. I love Frances Mayes style of writing, fluid, colorful and inspiring."
1,"Beware, disappointment ahead!","Having failed in my search for a copy of this best-seller in my local library I went ahead and ordered this book from amazon. I've enjoyed visiting Tuscany and I heard that this book was interesting. I've never been so disappointed in a book. Dull and pretentious are the first words that come to mind. Unreadable is another. If you are actually interested in a an american professor's mid-life crisis and her reawakening in Italy - go for it. Otherwise go no further, hit BACK now."
2,Too Much Remodeling Detail,"I picked up this book when it first came out and couldn't get through it because of the painfully detailed descriptions of the remodeling. This is less a book about beginning a new life in Italy and more about the remodeling of a house which just happens to be in Italy. I picked up the book again last week and did manage to finish it. I'm really surprised that this became a bestseller and would probably not read other books by this author. Julia Child wrote a wonderful, wonderful book called ""My Life in France"" that I would definitely recommend as a great example of travel writing."
2,"Primi, Secondi, Mindless Pap","This memoir reflects upon a wondrous journey to a fertile and passionate place, a place which oozes life well-lived, Tuscany. Unfortunately, the journey was taken and commented upon by the puddle-deep Ms. Mayes, a pompous, self-absorbed West Coast pseudo-intellectual who is quite impressed with herself, thank you very much. Her mindless quasi-philosophical musings irritate more than enlighten. Her distant, almost clinical analysis of the lovable and idiosyncratic people around her in Italy infuriates, and confirms, again, that she is missing the point by a mile. This is a woman who doesn't know where she is from: Georgia, Italy or San Fran. As she writes, she tries to find balance between the three and sell its reasonableness. She fails. Her truth is not to be found in Italy. That said, the recipes are good."
3,Disappointed,"My aunt encouraged me to read this book as she found it completely fascinating. Since I have an interest in Italy and things Italian, I was sure I would enjoy it....and I did to a point. I found the restoration of Bramasole very captivating. The pages flew by for me. Then she leaves Bramasole to venture out into the Italian countryside and she seems to get stuck in the mud. Her style becomes cumbersome and plodding and I lost complete interest. I was very disappointed. It seemed the most important thing to do was seek out a great table wine for the summer guests."
1,A self-absorbed treatise,"I read this book at the urging of my daughter, hoping to learn something about the Tuscan area, people and culture. What a mistake! This was the longest bit of ego-centered writing I have ever had the misforture to read. Ms Mayes is so determined to impress readers with her intelligence and cosmopolitan attitude that she fails to to give us any really interesting or useful information about the region (other than the recipes). Her character description is so poor that I learned more about the tmporary Polish workers she hired than I did about her husband/partner (I don't know if they are married or not). He comes across as a lackey, doing odd jobs for her. On another subject, she attempts to give a scholarly review of the religious history and practices of the region but what comes across is her total lack of understanding of the Catholic faith.My advice: buy a good travel book if you plan to visit Italy, and leave this book for the dust bin where it belongs."
4,Renovation and falling in love with Italy,"Like many other readers, I saw the movie before reading this book and was taken by surprise when I found that other than location, an old home in need of major renovation, and an having an American ex-pat as part of the story, there was little in common between the two. The book is a much quieter story without most of the drama of the movie and reads more like a travel documentary in style. I did really enjoy it once I got over my initial shock and was able to pick out a few scenes that were incorporated into the movie, including the stormy night and the owl. I did like reading about the couple's struggles and obvious love of Italy, particularly Tuscany. The recipes and descriptions of food and meals were an added bonus that I had not expected. I look forward to reading the follow-up books in the series."
1,Boring,Frances Mayes has an unimaginative and dry writing style that makes this book painful to get through. It was selected for our book club and no one finished it. I finally stopped after reading three pages about a fence. The writer is pretentious and the writing is dull. Skip it.
4,a most pleasant suprprise,"I did not expect to like this book because it has been so popular, and I have not wanted to put it down. Frances Mayes has made evcerything about her journey sound interesting, even the part wehre she explains how they have to get rid of her trash! Most of all, it has made me feel like I am in Tuscany, and has probalby openend up the country to more tourism than a million guide books would!"
2,Repetitive and Dull,"I was excited to read this book after all of the rave reviews it received. Unfortunately, I had problems finishing it and began forcing myself to read it thinking it would get better. It didn't. It was very repetitive and often described the same thing over and over. At times the author comes across as an arrogant know-it-all, as though she's the only educated and cultured American who travels the right way. She sends out the message that she's the greatest cook who ever lived, that it turns you off to the food she's describing."
3,All you ever wanted to know about Italian cooking,"I enjoyed her look into the Italian culture and the differences between the ""American way of doing things"" and the ""Italian way of doing things"". She is definately a talented writer and she can capture your attention with her use of the written word. There was too much about cooking/food in general. You could almost use this book as a menu guide in Italy. She should have focused more on the interesting cultural observations and less on what she just ate (or is about to eat). Give me a break...an entire chapter on olive oil!"
3,Interesting but shallow,"On the one hand, her desciption of the Italian cuisine would make anyone salivate. However, I was rather disappointed in the rather shallow descriptions of Italy and the Italians for that matter. I don't believe she captured the core of the Italians she met. She seemed to describe them as ""The Italians"", rather than individuals like you and I. Though I must admit she wrote beautifully, she tried too hard to write from an ""Italian"" point of view and failed miserably. As an Italian reviewer wrote, try Tim Parks' An Italian Neighbour or An Italian Education."
1,Disappointing--not what I expected.,"I thought the calendar would have pictures of Bramasole, which I was very interested in after reading Mayes' two books. But it only offers a few outside shots of the building. Where are the kitchen they labored over, the fireplaces, etc.? I'm not interested in pictures of grapes, vineyards. I wanted to see THE HOUSE."
5,ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS--WONDERFULLY WRITTEN,"Frances Mayes' is a terrific writer. Her book, Under the Tuscan Sun, has inspired me in more ways than just visiting Italy---although I am anxiously awaiting my trip next year.Her easy, no nonsense approach to writing about her daily activities, finds, pleasures, problems etc invites the reader to sit, relax and feel like you're talking to your best friend about her trip.I absolutely loved the book. I've been tempted to take up creative writing and I would love to be one of Frances Mayes' students at SF State.Ms. Mayes' has a beautiful way of expressive vocabulary.The book gets FIVE STARS in my Opinion!!!!"
5,Absolute keeper.,"Lush, vivid, warm and beautifully written, this little treasure deserves every bit of the attention it has received. It's been a long time since I rationed out the last 20 pages of a book, so desperate was I for it NOT to end. We are treated to a celebration of Tuscany, the human spirit and the written word--brava!"
2,The good the bad and the brutto,"I was torn about this book, there were sections of it that I truly enjoyed reading, which was during this spring while on a month and a half exploration of Italy.But somewhere towards the end there was something in the tone of the narration that was starting to bother me. Upon reflection it occurred to me that it seemed somewhat self congratulatory and lacking in any real humility.It was kind of an anti-""Europe through the back door"" approach that made a point of always emphasizing the joy of things only available to those with substantial wealth, whereas for me the most beautiful enchanting experiences in Italy were the things that money can't buy.As for the recipes, I personally thought there were way too many of them, but then I'm not much of a cook."
2,I tried,"I rarely don't finish books. I think I made it through 200 pages of this one before I finally flung it across the room. The author does a good job of describing food and recipes and inspired me to try some of them. That was why I gave the book 2 stars. If it had been written as a cookbook with some brief diversionary stories about Italy I would have enjoyed it. Unfortunately, the author bores you with long, drawn out, self indulgent episodes about her summers in Italy. I finally thought to myself, if someone like this cornered me at a party I would deperately be trying to get away from them. Instead of being transported to a idyllic place, I felt like I was trapped in my living room with an annoying neighbor with boxes of vacation slides."
1,Not Great,I was really looking forward to this book because I enjoyed the movie so much. This is the first time in my experience that the movie was better than the book. The author goes overboard in her descriptions to the point of being distracting from the actual story. I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie at all.
4,Italy Here I come,"What a delightful read. It was a wonderful escape into another world. I world I never have thought much of before. Italy was not very high up on my travel list, but after reading this book it has moved up considerable. If you enjoy reading about different cultures, enjoy cooking, and/or house decorating and renovation, that this is a must read."
3,"Okay, but Nothing Like the Movie","I saw the movie for this and loved it, so thought I would try the book. Wow. Completely different story than the movie, and I must say, one I did not like. Very colorful descriptions of her life in Italy, but got enough of that in just the first few chapters. Had to force myself to finish it; it was fun reading all the different recipes, even if I probably won't ever make them. :)"
3,Not what I expected...........,"I was expecting it to be more like the movie. Right from the start she talks in ""we"", so that is confusing. I haven't read too much of it, maybe will pick it up later."
2,Poor Editing,"I have this book in a physical form, but I bought it so that I could read it on my kindle. Obviously, I like the book, but I was really disappointed with the editing on the electronic version. There are typos, bad characters where accents or special characters should be, bad formatting... for the price, I really expected a more polished product."
4,A good book if your not in a hurry,This is a pretty good book...It's not perfect but Frances Mayes does a great job letting us(the reader) see what she sees and tastes what she tastes. I found the recipes a bit much..I am not one to read recipes unless I am acually going to make something..Overall great book...a great book for a long train ride.
2,Beautifully written and sterile,"Such a waste of talent! She writes beautifully, but this pretty superficial stuff. Did she find a publisher who had done market research and found that the combination of key words to get a best seller this year were Italy, food, wine, decoration and a mysterious man? (It worked, of course) Where is her sense of humor about herself, her humility about being a novice to Italy and Italian? Even for a book to read on trains or airplanes, it lacks the minimum amount of significance to make it more than a distraction. I would rather have read (another) well-written cookbook on Tuscan cookery. Or reread Dirk Bogarde's account of rebuilding a house in Provence: now there's a book!"
5,"Much different than the movie, I liked the book more","A memoir about an American college professor and her lover who purchase a deserted villa in Cortona, Italy, and attempt to restore it to its former glory; thus, enabling them to enjoy ""la dolie vita."" Along the way they learn to deal with the idiosyncrasies of the local workmen and the slower paced Italian way of life. Much different than the movie, I liked the book more. An added bonus is the recipes she includes."
1,How could Italy be boring? Ask Frances Mayes....,"This was such an incredibly self-absorbed, boring read. When I buy a book to be taken away to another place - I don't expect to have to skip chapters because I just can't make it through. And remember - she's talking about ITALY! Peter Mayle is a much more enlightened and talented writer - although he writes of France and not Italy - his books are so far beyond Frances Mayes that he is in another league! Read Peter! Trust me!"
4,"Sunny,Inspirational and refreshing! Read it this summer!","As Ms.Mayes says, this is a book about the simple life in Italy. A life so simple that in its simplicity and beauty is always charming. I have read many books that describe in words and pictures the wonderful places that one can find everywhere in Italy,but ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" rather than photograph peoples and places inspires the reader to rethink the notion of a voyage or for that matter of a vacation. After reading ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" I got the final push that made me buy a small apartment at a beachfront and transform it into a little mediterranean paradise (it is in the caribbean, actually.) Mayes racount of how she converted an old house in the Tuscan Countryside, that she found and bought in shambles, into a second home abroad full of light and aromas is an entertaining and inspirational reading... and the recipes, excellent if you are into cooking or just enjoy a good meal, a sunny book!"
2,MARTHA STEWART DOES ITALY,"A book about the simple life? Maybe, if you have tons of money to carelessly fling about. Simple planks make lovely shelves.....yeah, right. It would probably cost a hundred bucks per plank to get something that doesn't look like a recycled pallet.I was swept up occasionally by some poetic descriptions, but the effect was lost as she kept going on and on and on and on....Ms. Mayes seems rather emotionally detached from people. She appreciates them in an aesthetic sense, but I get the feeling that she would ditch her husband if he didn't match the decor."
2,Self-absorbed and Pretentious,"Although the food descriptions were mouth-watering and the inclusion of recipes was a pleasant surprise, over-all the book was tedious. The local Italians were written about in a condescending and patronizing manner. Some of the text served only to get petty jabs in on other more accomplished authors. After reading this book, I still prefer Provence!"
4,This book satistfied my yearning,"to renovate an old house in a foreign country. Actually, I'm not sure that I ever had such a yearning, but I don't after reading this book. Don't get me wrong--Mayes writes beautifully about a place and activities she loves, but I definitely feel like I've been ""close enough"" to the hard work portion of her story!The book drags in spots, and at times Mayes seems a bit smug and superior, but perhaps that's just contentment and appreciation filtered through print. She does, however, seem overly delighted with the ""characters"" she meets, as though they were less people she didn't really know well and more practitioners of quirks for her entertainment. Overall I liked the book, but I'm not sure I'd read it again--except for the recipes."
1,Not enough about Italy and too much about Mayes' feelings.,"Sorry, but I just don't get it. The first chapter or two were entertaining and enlightening. The rest is a boring, self-absorbed account of the author's feelings about the good fortune she has had to buy a house in Italy. I learned very little about the Italian people and more than I ever wanted to know about Ms. Mayes' eating habits and flea market finds. Definitely not for the person preparing for a trip to Italy."
4,Can't wait to get back there...,"I am still in the middle of the book, but I have observed a few things.Mayes' writing is light, yet she still has the ability to reflect deftly the true sensuality, of the land and its people. I am decidedly more interested in learning a people's culture by walking in their shoes, rather than by reading their history books. Mayes scores big with me on this point.Kudos for including the recipes for some of the scrumptious dishes she mentions in the book! Even more for making the book into a basic Italian Primer for some of the more important terms!I'm not thoroughly interested in the details of rebuilding the Italian home - not yet, anyway - but I now have the seeds of a dream planted in my head, how many other books these days truly inspire people.I agree with the reader who indicated that one shouldn't read this book without being prepared to fall in love with Italy."
2,"So, So. It made the train ride a little less dull","Under a Tuscan Sun was a moderately enjoyable book, although nothing to rave about.Although well written it had that undeniable trait shared by most American travel / overseas books; it was on the whole ignorant of all things foreign.I found many of the author's observations condescending and cutesy."
2,"Bascially ""A Year in Tuscany""","I, like many other readers, was put off by the author's flippancy at spending money. The book was full of complaining about the costs of extreme renovations and their inconviences. I was also quite irritated when the author insinuates those that try to get a crash course in Europe, i.e. those who CAN'T afford an Italian farm house and the ability to spend 3-4 months away from there domestic jobs, are inferior to people like herself. Additionally, I found her writing to be rather unstructured. Perhaps, I would have enjoyed this more if it had been written by a poor, struggling graduate student sleeping in hostels and taking odd jobs. If you'd like a book with a similar concept (foreigner moves to another country to fix up rustic farmhouse), I would recommend ""A Year in Provence"" by Peter Mayle."
2,loved the movie-not the book,"This is one to slog through--she lost me half way through the book with ""I almost stepped on a soft,dead rat..."" please!! I would not but another F.Mayes, ever!!"
3,Why don't we all move to Italy?,"A book's worth of notes and musings written by Mayes, who bought a big old house in Tuscany. A college professor in the United States, spending her summers (and some other holidays) at her house in Italy, she shares with the reader random observations and experiences of fixing up the house and living in Italy.She has a very pretty sort of writing style, restful and other-wordly. Her life sounds wonderful, and perhaps the only downside to this book is that I think I'm supposed to feel a little guilty for (a) being a dumb american (even though I'm canadian) and (b) not spending a fortune and working my butt off on a run-down house in Tuscany.Oh! One more downside: it's also bad for the diet - you'll eat lots and lots of nothing but Italian food while reading this book!"
2,Basta cosi!! (Enough already!!),"The book started off as a charming discourse on life in Tuscany, but I found myself by the first third of the book yelling, ""per l'amor del cielo - for the love of god - quit going on and on re. the perfect tomato and eat the f**king thing already!!"
1,the worst book I ever wasted time reading,"I can't believe that this book was on our best-seller list in the USA. No wonder the European countries percieve us as unintelligent and mediocre. I am also baffled that this woman, Frances Mayes, is an instructor of creative writing. I felt ill (embarassed for her) when I read the descriptions of the countryside or maybe a description of one on the men working for her. I almost threw the book out the window of the train on the way to Venice, but decided that I paid too much for it in Florence. I also felt that I should at least give the recipes a chance when I got home. Did anyone bother to edit this book? I can not believe the grammatic errors! I can never again, unfortunately, read about the Etruscans and their tombs. It was overkill. However, even though I did not enjoy the book, it gave me the confidence and the reassurance to know that I can do anything and could get some kind of praise or recognition for it."
2,Tuscany is for hose bags,"Don't be fooled by the repressed bourgeois hype - Tuscany is not all that special. The people are really uptight and annoying and narcissistic and foolish and small and petty and not sexually attracted to me, which is really problematic. I don't have these problems in Albania."
1,Boring ...,"After many brave attempts to read this book, I had to concede defeat after page number 62. It took me a good one week to reach that far. I have been to Tuscany and to be honest, the book doesn't seem to do any justice to the beautiful place. The prose is verbose, lackadaisical and (worst of all) bereft of any humor. On many occasions, the writer makes sudden tangential diversions (with unknown characters) confusing and subsequently irritating the reader. And, did I mention that there are many recipes in book? Totally unacceptable for a memoir-based travel book.If you have seen the movie already, then the book might be a little difficult (and boring) to read."
2,I just can't get through this book!,"I'm listening to the audio CD right now - but, it's torture! I find myself falling asleep at the wheel while it's playing in the car...so, I""m going to have to find something else to listen to...and fast!I was expecting a fairly similar story-line to the one in the movie. No way Jose! The only thing in common is that she bought a ""fixer uper in Tuscany"". No divorce...no lesbian friends...no romance...no funny repairmen (yet)...no joy...no dancing...no sex. Instead, the author narrates in her very irritating Southern drawl complete with very noisy saliva smacking (it' hard to ignore). She talks on, and on about a dry well...or repairing a stone wall...or blah, blah...blah... I keep hoping it will get better...but, it's just more of the same, so I'm going to cut my losses - and try to sell the audio book on e-bay."
3,"better than the movie, but not good enough","Anyone planning to visit Cortona would do better to read Amanda Craig's novel, Love in Idleness, which not only has the advantage of being funny but is infinitely better-written. Frances Mayes's autobiographical account of how she bought a decaying farmhouse in Tuscany is pleasant enough, and her affection for the landscape the the food described pretty well but there is no structure to her story, and the whole thing viewed through such rose-tinted spectacles I felt embarrassed."
2,It's not the movie,"I bought this book because I simply adore the movie. This book is not the movie. The movie took a few lines from it here and there, but it is not the same story. There is no Katherine, no Marcello, no Pawel, no Patti, etc. The entire plot of the movie doesn't exist at all in the book. If you loved the movie and you're wanting to dig deeper into that story by buying the book you'll be disappointed. But if you've never seen the movie, and you just want a snap shot of an American's life in Italy it's not bad."
3,Would have been better as three magazine articles,"This book essentially had three themes that could have been boiled down to three magazine articles: the renovation of the house, the cooking, and the Italian travelogue. The house renovation was very interesting, but left my thirsting for pictures (perhaps I'm too literal). The recipes were interesting, and I may try a few. The travelogue put me to sleep."
1,"Tedious, patronizing, self-absorbed, but good recipes.","This affluent Californian pretends to ""experience"" the people of Tuscany without ever bothering to really know any locals (except for the expatriates, whom we presume she can see in a mirror). She is just a bit too precious and really seems like Martha Stewart in Italy. As an Italian-American, a cook, and an architect, I find Frances Mayes a comical American who never really knows anyof the Italians living around her, gets hoodwinked by every contractor she encounters, and carries the renovations to absurdity. At least she has some good recipes in the book. It was a waste of my time to read this syrupy baloney on Wonder Bread when I craved a taste of real prosciutto and fresh crusty bread. On her next trip, she should truly befriend a few Italians without hiring them."
3,Martha Stewart Goes Italian,"Having spent time in Tuscany last summer, I found this book just a bit much. Way too much detail about the Italian workmen...those of us who can't afford to hire someone to do EVERYTHING get a little resentful. I love all things Italian, the people, the food, the wine, the fabulous surroundings...just not this book. A better bet is R. Lewis' City of Florence for an interesting look at the history and culture of Florence and Tuscany."
1,Martha Stewart in Tuscany,"This book was boring, whiny, and obnoxious. This rich b****h buys a Tuscan villa, and then writes hundreds of pages listing all of the other things she buys to furnish the house: The title of this book should have been ""Shop 'til You Drop in Tuscany."" Throughout all this shopping, she feels sorry for herself and whines about how her Tuscan home doesn't boast the niceties of her other home in San Francisco. When actual Italians make cameo appearances in her self-centered monologue, they are quaint little stereotypes. And often the author is just plain wrong about her facts: For instance, in a chapter about visiting the Maremma, she goes to Montalcino, which ain't the Maremma. I suppose there are Martha Stewart-esque Italophiles who will think this book is ""precious,"" but otherwise, beware."
3,delicious details,Frances Mayes provides beautiful descriptions of the landscape to the point you feel you're their.
1,Pompous and self serving,Frances doesn't belong in the country I recognize. She is extremely patronizing toward Italians and appears to be a spolied rich girl. Who is Ed? Is he her boyfriend; future spouse; current beau?She makes it seem all of if all of us can simply purchase a home in Tuscany. It is second nature! We all have off four months a year We were all left huge inheritances. Frankly after reading this book I can't stand the woman. She is also quite condescending toward Italians (my heritage) and Ed. It's all about Frances and her petty problems.I can't believe they made a bogus movie based (losely) on this book.Please visit Tuscany and you will see it's different that this self-indulgent tripe.By the way we visited Cortona and spit at her house!
2,OH PLEASE!!,"The ""emotionally stingy"" comment is a bit over the top don't you think? Please stick to the actual ""review"" of the book and help the rest of us make a decision PLEASE! It's only a book, not the United States Constitution!Many of the other intelligent and thoughtful contributions are well worth the read and I thank you many of you for helping me to decide whether or not this book is worth the purchase.I sincerely hope that Tuscany is much friendlier than the United States."
5,"Tuscany, The Return","After reading Frances Mayes, Under The Tuscan Sun. I once again I was thrust into the wonderful sights, sounds and tastes of Tuscany. It has been 15 years since my travels to Italy, however, Frances' descriptions of Tuscany are so vivid that once you begin to read you will be drawn deeper and deeper into the most wonderful memories of previous journeys. If you have never traveled to Italy, Frances' book describes the ""good life in Italy exactly as it truly is. Her descriptions of the towns, the people and the food is incredible. All I had to do was shut my eyes and there I was again in beautiful Tuscany."
2,"Pretentious Memoir - ""My home, well ONE of my homes!""","I have NOT seen the movie, so this review is only based on the book.This book was highly regarded by a few family members as a beautiful read. Sure, the descriptions are lovely and well written, but the whole idea of a memoir is suppose to be interesting--this is not. I love travel memoirs, reading peoples travel stories, but this was like reading a guide to restore a house--very dry. Ms. Mayes writing reminds me of David Sedaris mocking a wealthly tourist, ""My home, well... ONE of my homes"".I have decided to give the book another try. XM Sonic Theater is playing the book and it is being read by the author. However, Ms. Mayes monotone voice and lack of live storytelling makes the story even worse. I understand why authors have voice actors to read the books.The book is written lovely, but does not exceed the expectation I was excepting."
1,SIMPLE QUICK SUGGESTION!!!!,Look at the reviews. You either love the book or hate it. There doesnt seem to be much of an inbetween. If you are thinking of buying the book then go to the bookstore and sit down and read the first chapter or two. If you think you can handle more of the same then you'll probably like the book. If you keep thinking....whens the story going to begin and when am i going to stop hearing about the house....youre out of luck...put the book away! I like detail....but this book is like talking to that one person that will never let you leave a conversation and has to tell you about people you dont know and are so descriptive they have to tell you the name of ever intersection they passed in their story. I think this will probably be the first time I've EVER said this.....THE MOVIE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE BOOK!
3,OK,"The story is difficult to follow. To be fair, I purchased this book after purchasng ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" book and seeing the movie."
1,ugh..,"Ok, so I'm not the best person to review this book. I don't like fiction.But, this book had a lot of hype and someone gave it to me so, not to be left out of the conversation, I read it.Sweet (ugh), and simple which I find boring.... and useless.At any rate, I'm not a good one to review fiction and obviously a lot of people liked it enough that it was made into a movie!"
3,Random House Kindle pricing insane,"GREAT book, The price for the digital kindle version costs more than the physical book. Are they crazy or do they think we're stupid? How many books do they expect to sell with this price model?"
2,seriously boring,"this has got to be among the most boring books I have ever read. I had heard such great things, that I suggested we read it for our book club. 50 more pages and I seriously do not think I can finish it... YAWN"
2,Running Away to Italy,"The lanuage and visualizations are stunning. I enjoyed the pictures the author paints not just of the country itself but of the food and the people. The base story is a bit hard for me though, most of us that have such trials in our life can't afford to ""buy"" happiness so it makes the heroine a bit tiresome."
2,Author is too self-absorbed,"The repetitive use of ""I"" as the subject, with the occassional ""we"" largely detracted from the descriptions of the local color. The recipes in the middle earned the second star. For a much better foreign settling story try ""A Year in Provence"""
2,Stilted and Condescending,"A friend of Italian origin lent me ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and was in raptures about the book. Sadly I found it tedious and contrived. In describing Italy one would assume there to be energy and colour. Ms Mayes' writing is the antithesis of the culture she seeks to be embraced into."
3,The aurthor seems disconnected from the land and the people,"I was very dissapointed in this book. Mayer seemed to be doing a house in Tuscany because it was the ""in"" thing to do, not because she loved the land and it's people. She never seases trying to impress us (or herself) with her level of sophistcation. For people who are interested in knowing what it would be like to live and upgrade a house in a small town in italy, this is not the book for you. A far superoir book is A Valley in Italy, by Lisa St Aubin DeTeran, who really gives the reader a vicarious experience of living and working with the people in a small town in Italy. It is a delightful book which puts Under the Tuscan Sun to shame."
2,Tedious read. Unorganized material.,"I found this book tedious. Perhaps more work should have been done rather than simply copy the author's scrapbook memoirs into book form. Not enough care was taken in the organization of the text. In addition, the workers and their names, the contractors, those that did the work, and those that applied for the work, they're ALL there and are taking up too much space and time for no reason. Some are such unnecessary characters. So a contractor seemed to be charming, but she didn't hire him... I feel like the author would list everyone she met in the street if she only had their names in her scrapbook. Why was this book on the bestseller lists?"
4,If I had to choose between Provence and Tuscany...,"I have a feeling that the author really liked the Provence books by Peter Mayle. Although I enjoyed the book, the characters were no where near as colorful and the situations not nearly as amusing. I appreciated the fact that she didn't spend too much time on her personal situation, some authors just bore you to deathwith the banal details of their lives.The most enjoyable part of this book were the recipes and the descriptions of the wonderful food and wine. Obviouslyan accomlished chef with an imaginative palate, she made my mouth water with the details of Tuscan cuisine.The only thing better in the book were the recipes she added. I can't wait for summer! I'll also be on the lookout fordiscount fares to Italy!"
4,A brilliant way to spend a summer's read,"It is so easy to be envious of a lifestyle that jets between the dreamy Tuscan village and the dreary life of academia in a busy, unexcitable American city. Most of all the envy comes when it the reader's stomach is empty and the delicious food is rolled out before your very eyes. To be read only after eating."
2,Under the Tuscan Sun,"The story line is good,the only thing that didn't get 5 stars from my wife and I was that the author read the book. She should have used a proffesional. The book and the DVD got our 5 stars. J.A.A."
2,Poor Rich Girl Decorates Old Run-Down Villa,"The lemon cake recipe is the rich part. The poor girl who read the entire book for her book club was me. This book will NOT decorate my bookshelf, it's going to be recycled at the Goodwill. I gave the book 2 stars: one because someone actually published it and the second because I really gave it the time to finish it, hoping that I would find a plot or story that I could talk about with my fellow readers. To think I actually recommended this one, well, better luck next month."
1,Shallow beyond endurance,"This book is pretentious, shallow, badly written and snobby beyond endurance. I wish I had borrowed the book from the library instead of wasting money buying it. Hopefully, the people of Tuscany will not have too many more rich and condescending writers snapping up their properties, thus saving us from another infinitely boring read."
4,Under the Tuscan Sun,I have not seen the movie and just picked up the book at random in a bookstore. As a big fan of memoirs and non-fiction (as well as a great lover of food in general and Italy in particular) I found the book to be completely enchanting. I look forward to reading other books by Frances Mayes.
2,A Must Not Read,"I didn't finish the first 20 pages of this book. The author seems very much a person who went to Italy to purchase a house and fields just to say she did (and does) it. No real interest in the history or culture of the area from what I read. Another reader said, ""overeducated individuals with exagerated views"" and hit it right on the head.To me anyway the book appears to be in the same vein as ""Without Reservations."" With that one, as well as Tuscan Sun, I went looking for a light summer read and this was disappointingly not it."
2,"If you're into home repairs, you may love this book.","I read this book since I studied in the town the story is based in. She is a very vivid and brilliant writer, I would say quite the imagination though. It's way overly romanticized. She mostly writes about fixing up the house she bought in Italy. What really makes it any different from buying a house in the US? Her romantic notions of Italy did bring me back to the simplicity of life in Italy, but overall, it just feels self indulgent on the author's part."
4,Enjoyed the book,"This was a re-read, and I loved it again. I know there's plenty here who don't think much of this book, but it totally appeals to my utterly romantic notions of running away to live in Europe someday....sigh.... ;-) Haven't been to Italy yet, but this book *was* largely responsible for my subsequent trips to France, Spain, and Turkey. And my list (TBV list - ""to be visited"" - tee hee) has been growing ever since."
1,Boring,"I found this book desperately boring and only ever made it to the half-way point, as much as I tried. The only reason I saw the movie was because I was curious to know how they would make a story out of it. I, too, am saddened about the ""renovation"" to the load-bearing wall."
3,Tuscany seems lovely - but better without Mayes,"This is a fine book, but certainly not in the class of 'A Year in Provence.' Her pace is often forcibly slow and she herself pompous. A nice read about Tuscany, but colored poorly by the author."
1,Very boring and dry.,"Most definitely NOT a page-turner! I found this book to be dull and passionless. She tells her story in a dry, emotionless style which is devoid of insight, creativity or humor. (She teaches creative writing?!) That this book is a best seller can only reflect Americans' love of anything Italian! Our book discussion group read this book based on its popularity and our love of Italy. Well, half of the group couldn't even finish reading it due to total indifference and boredom. We unanimously found it tedious and difficult, if impossible, to ""get into."" And those persistent souls who determindly finished the book found no shred of insight explaining the author's motivations for buying and restoring this house. I'd have to say this book is a loser."
5,They are living the life I dream of.,"Purchased this book while waiting at the airport for my flight. I love everything Italian and was glad to find the book. On my flight this book took me somewhere else. It is wonderful, I could not put it down, could not wait to see what happened next."
1,self absorbed and repetitive -- a real disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this book -- it's so self absorbed that the reader is unable to create one's own sense of life under the Tuscan sun! For a poet, Ms. Mayes doesn't seem to be aware of the ""objective correlative"" -- in which the writer is supposed to create an image for the reader, not belabor her own viewpoints, including the way Ms. Mayes feels every single time she contemplates how ancient Tuscany is. When she steps out of the ""me"" box, however, as when she travels to the Etruscan tombs, the books is quite good -- too bad those instances were so rare."
2,"Begins well, ends in self-absorbed rumination","This book began as an entertaining description of a woman refurbishing an abandoned villa in Italy. The author brings alive the Tuscan countryside and makes one want to visit the area as soon as possible to revel in the sunshine. The book, however, could have been remarkably shortened if the author had kept her own fanciful ruminations about life out of the text. She seems to look down on the people around her, especially their religion, which is ironic since she takes D.H. Lawrence to task for being guilty of this same attitude of superiority in his book about Tuscany."
2,"Over-rated, smug and verbose","I bought this book with great expectations, having read and loved Elizabeth Romer's ""Tuscan Year."" Mayes' writing, however, is humorless, self-conscious and DULL. This book has been endlessly hyped and I am annoyed with myself for buying it. I'll take Mayle over Mayes any day!"
4,dreaming of a house in Italy,"We went to Italy on our honeymoon and I had just finished this book when we arrived in Cortona where we tasted the delicious pastas in Trattoria Dardano and walked in the mountains surrounding the city. Yes, life there must be as Frances Mayes describes it, simply wonderful! I 'd like to recommand also ""A house in Italy. The several seasons of a villa in Umbria"" by Lisa St-Aubin de Teran. Certainly as captivating as ""Under the Tuscan Sun""!"
4,You almost feel you are there,A very personal and vivid account of the restoration of an old Tuscan house. The house and its surroundings come to life as the new owners work on it. Mayes's loving observations on her adopted summer country are evocative and engaging. You can live through the restoration and tour Tuscany without having to deal with redoing the plumbing and the plaster.
5,Mouth Watering,This was a wonderful read. My only complaint was that I was perpetually hungry the entire time I read this book! Mayes not only includes some evocative descriptions of Tuscany and the Italians....she also throws in some wonderful recipes and tempting descriptions of the various meals she prepared while at Bramasole. I recommend this book with a warning: don't read this if you're on a diet!
4,"Read the book, forget the movie","Having seen the beauty of northern Italy twice I could visualize Frances Mayes' Tuscany in her book, and the time and effort she and Ed spent fixing the ""villa"" with the help of local craftsmen. Loved her week-long trip by car in around the area and the information I learned, and liked the recipes.I found the movie, that I watched a week after reading the book, a typical Hollywood cheesy take-off. No continuity of characters and the typical American/Italian love story. Read the book, forget the movie. Why not watch the 1950's ""Summertime"" set in Venice, with Hepburn and Brassi - far more heartwarming."
2,Tale of the Tape,"The book is a completely lightweight trip through Tuscany, clearly tailored for what must be the burgeoning Martha Stewart demographic. All well and good, but be forewarned: the tape commits the (usually) unforgiveable mistake of allowing the author to read her own material. Authors author and performers perform; when one mistakes oneself for the other, the result is nowhere more painfully illustrated than in the ghastly narrative in the audio tape version of ""Under the Tuscan Sun""."
1,Droll . . . . .,"Excited to be taken to Tuscany without leaving the comfort of my couch, I was very disappointed. All the complaining at the beginning of the book about the high prices of homes and the ""struggle"" to obtain their dream just made me laugh - please, most of us don't even vacation in Europe let alone purchase a home there - get over yourself. I agree with the review sighting Bob Villa goes to Tuscany - the whole scene regarding their remodel was just too involved - not the Tuscany I was interested in. Eating, and more eating, gardening and shopping. Racing around in small cars - and Ed - beloved husband and companion - I think not - just ""some guy"" that is occaisionally commented on.This book is boring, difficult to get through and leads nowhere. I wasted my time. Nice recipies though."
1,No Magic Here!,"This book misses the mark--from the mispelled words to the inability to connect to the magic of Tuscany. I expected to find the spirit of the Tuscan people--but really, the book is too condescending to capture the real thing. If you want a real good read, try Peter Mayle's books on Provence and you will know why Ms. Mayes just does not do it."
4,What a Dream.......,"This book has great descriptions of Italy and the people, food, and different towns there. The book is mainly about the author and her boyfriend renovating a house in Italy, the trials and tribulations they endure, and ends on a nice note with the two main chracters enjoying the house. It is very witty and makes you smile often. There is a plus too. Included are many authentic recipes for dishes that the main character makes throughout the book. The only gripe I have is that she uses many Italian words, but doesn't describe them all. Or if she does, you soon forget what it means because there are so many that she uses. Regardless, this book is great."
1,Save yourself from tedium!,"Your $ could be better spent almost anywhere else. How this book could have received so many good reviews simply baffles me. It was a struggle to finish, kept hoping for a glimpse of humanity in the author -- but never found it. Did Ed write the part about the Italian driving, the only fun part of this story?"
5,Like a Wonderful Vacation with a Good Friend,"Reading Under The Tuscan Sun was absolutely delightful, like taking a wonderful vacation with a good friend. A lovely, enjoyable read! One of my all-time favorites."
4,An Italian dream,"Frances Mayes is one lucky woman.She has a stimulating university teaching job that just happens to leave her summers free, a devotedly helpful lover/mate who also just happens to have free summers and to share her passion for Italy, and a farmhouse called Bramasole in a Tuscan valley.Mayes writes about her summer house in this account: the hassle of buying it, the headaches and pleasures of renovating it, the joy of discovering a new place that slowly becomes a second home. If only I could contain my jealousy! And now she's a bestselling author, too. Is there no justice?My envy colored my reading of this story, to the point where I cast overly harsh judgements upon Mayes. Despite my prejudice, Mayes deserves the praise she has garnered for her lush writing style evocative of the beautiful views and delectable tastes of Italy. If only I could be there, too..."
2,The Ugly Americans Do Tuscany,"For all of F.M.'s knowledge of Italian (restaurant-menu level) and friendships with locals (limited to expats and Polish workmen under her employ), she may as well as saved herself some commute time and bought a farmhouse in Napa."
4,Molto Bene!,"I found this book to be wonderful, at first I was put off by Mayes' constant rambling about every topic, but then as I got further into the book I realized that I was learning a great deal about the culture of Italy that I probably wouldn't get to learn in my Italian class. I plan on studying in Italy in a few years and this is a great way to get to know the country!"
2,"Stick to your writing, Frances.","This book and film are probably wonderful escapism for women who read house and kitchen magazines. The descriptions of gardens, food and construction are vivid, but without much substance. The abridged version, read by the author, is a trial to listen to. She reads in an adenoidal, flat voice with almost unrecognizable Southern pronounciation. She should be quiet and express herself only in writing."
2,Fascination followed by tedium and some confusion,"The book starts off well, and the archaological part of it, i.e. finding the artifacts, unearthing the stone sink, were fascinating. But after awhile I became distracted by the writer herself. Who is this woman? Who is this Ed guy? Her husband? Her boyfriend? I'm guessing the latter since she tells everything in the first person -- ""I'm buying a house."" ""I'm on the plane to Paris."" It seems pretty clear that the money is all hers. Poor Ed feels like an afterthought, good thing he was so handy around the house. The same goes for all the other people in her story. Okay, maybe it was just meant to be a travel guide, but couldn't she fill us in a little more on the actual life forms with whom she came into contact?Having said that, there were times when I bought into the mood she created entirely and forgot the above objections. After all, who doesn't dream of a fantasy home in Italy?"
4,Mayes on the Money,"Freances Mayes is a delightful writer. Both Under the Tuscan Sun and Bella Tuscany provide a leisurely trip through Tuscany. Whether you enjoy the cuisine or delight in the sights, either book is a winner."
2,Expert prose but no page-turner,"The idea of an exploration of the simple life in the picturesque Tuscany from the view of the American rich and well-educated, sprinkled with local color in form of authentic recipes sounded promising. But although the descriptions of land and people were rich and often poetic, the book just couldn't hold my interest. There were just too many details about the reconstruction too much own shoulder patting and too little `action'. It was like watching a 4-hour uncut home video from a friend's vacation: Interesting mostly for the people in it."
2,I'm sure it's a beautiful...if only I had the patience,"I tried and tried to read this book. But it quickly bores me. Frances Mayes writing is beautiful but verbose. Everytime I try to read it, I'd zone out and have to start all over again. Maybe some day, when I am truely desperate for a book, I might pick this one up again."
1,Italian Fairy-tale Written by a Non-Italian,"Being 1/2 Italian, and having family in Northern Italy, and having visited Italy 6 times I have to say... buy this book ONLY if:1) You've never been to Italy, and2) You love to cook (and read recipes), and3) You want to read what it's like to be able to afford a home in SF and renovate one in Tuscany, and4) You want to cling to a fairy-tale vision of Italy, or5) You're on a deserted island with nothing else to read.However, if you really want to know what it's like to live/be in Italy, and what Italian culture is really like, I suggest you read any or all of Tim Parks' books (""Italian Neighbors Or, a Lapsed Anglo-Saxon in Verona"", ""Italian Education"", or ""A Season with Verona: Travels Around Italy in Search of Illusion, National Character, and...Goals!""). Tim is an Englishman who married an Italian woman and moved to Italy and had kids. Parks' descriptions of Italian life are real... Mayes' descriptions of Italian life are a bit too syrupy for my stomach."
2,Don't bother - there are many better books,"I enjoyed parts of this and ""Bella Tuscany"" on a superficial, escapist level. I like sunshine, travel, Italy, good food, shopping and nice houses so these can be a pleasant escape from grey, rainy Scottish winters (and summers!) However, I have to agree with many of the negative comments made about the way the books are written and the way the author comes across. At times they can be deadly dull, unbelievably pretentious, as well as patronising and humourless. If you want to read about house renovating in Italy try ""A Valley In Italy"" by the fascinating Lisa St Aubin De Teran instead. Also, as many reader have previously mentioned, Peter Mayle and Tim Parks are much better on adjusting to life in a foreign country."
1,Dry and Dreary........,"The book is plain dull and annoying.Mayes desperately tries to make herself sound educated and cultured by quoting Horace and Plato in situations that don't really seem to warrant such a quote. Her descriptions of the luscious Italian countryside are dry and unimaginative, and what she talks about is simply uninteresting.Italy is an amazing country, but this book doesn't do it justice at all."
1,Pasta and Vino Anyone?,"All this book did for me was make me hungry. The author incorrectly categorized this piece as fiction and literature, when in fact it is a glamorized cookbook with some house restoration spices thrown in. I am going to cut out the recipes (most of which look quite appetizing) and use the rest of the book for firestarter."
4,"Take the book for what it is, and it will return much more.","Although this book has appeal for a very broad audience (thus its success), she's not writing for anyone -- or any particular genre. If you are looking for a practical travel guide, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a renovation guide, ditto. If you are looking for a story about her love for Ed, you won't get it. If you want it as a cookbook, you will be bored by everything else.However, if you pick up the book as none of those things above, simply as one woman's collection of memories -- a portrait of her summers with a focus on the land and its pleasures -- you will be enraptured. You will not regret this book if you expect it to be full of little gems of information. Instead of tedious details, look at her close description of everything she does as poetry. Immerse yourself in her unique and rich language, and the book will warm your soul."
1,More about consumerism goes abroad than about Italy,"It seems sad and strange that this book should be a best seller. The author writes mainly about her material acquisitions--the villa, the linens, the pottery, the furniture. Her contacts with Italians are of the depth of my contacts with my plumber, real estate agent, or checkout clerk. She makes up for this by ""imagining"" the lives of people she sees--a condescending exercise that violates the integrity of these people's lives. Even the main characters, the author, her husband, her daughter, are described as roles--poet, gourmet cook, department chair, mill owner's daughter--rather than as people with emotions, quirks, sorrows and joys. ""Insights"" into Italy are from ""book larnin',"" not from experience.For an entertaining account of remodeling an Italian villa, ""Valley in Italy"" by Lisa St. Aubin De Teran is very entertaining. For insights into Italians and life in Italy, ""Italian Neighbors"" and ""An Italian Education"" by Tim Parks are great."
1,Another view from a Yuppi/semi-expat. turned anthropologist.,"I found the book extremely patronizing and gushy. I love Peter Mayle's account of Provence. He's funny and never forgets he's a Brit in France with his own quirky views. Mayes might as well refer to the ""Natives"" when she speaks of the Italians...does she ever really connect to anyone beyond the expats in the region? Let's face it, Tuscany has become the Florida of Europe, full of upper middle class expatriates who've bought up just about everything there is to buy and experience life as a semi- to permanent vacation. The book reads like Martha Stewart's guide to Italian Home renovation."
2,"As Mayes would put it, noioso (boring)","I hoped this book would be beautifully written, a quick but satisfying read. When you're writing about Italy, where can you go wrong? Well, Mayes showed me exactly how you can turn an interesting life story into a boring, monotonous book that won't end - just like those summer days in Tuscany. I also thought that Mayes' descriptions of the Italian culture were sometimes condescending. Oh, those quirky Italians with their weird manners, tiny fridges and no sense of time! Speaking of fridges, why are there two long chapters devoted solely to recipes? Not much happens in the other chapters, either.Italy deserves to be described by a better writer."
1,Self-Absorbed under the Tuscan Sun,"After I read and enjoyed Peter Mayle's books, my wife recommended this book and its sequel. I was terribly disappointed.Frances Mayes writes with none of the liveliness of Peter Mayle. Her writing is ponderous and clipped. I found myself laboring through the book, and was reminded of a movie in which I've looked at my watch to see how much longer until the credits. Rather than describe colorful characters and their interactions, she describes her renovated house and her reaction to it - both more precious than I could stand.No one seems to have edited this book. I found numerous cases of repeated facts and statements from one chapter to the next. I wondered if these had first appeared in a serialized version.Overall, none of the joy and magic of Peter Mayle's work."
1,Horrible Condom,"My wife and I have never used condoms are entire marriage, and since we were both virgins when we got married, we have never had a need for condoms. My wife is now pregnant and we are going to have to use condoms during breastfeeding. So I am for sure not a condom expert, but I know when one is better than other. These were the worst we have tried. They slipped off, were not ""thin"" feeling, and we finally just switched to another one we were trying. I just threw out the rest of them since they were so horrible."
2,not for above the average,"For the feel this product deserves 5stars, however durability is an issue for the above average population. In the mid 7s out of 4 kimono condoms used 2 broke, go figure."
1,weakest condoms in the world,These condoms are awful. They are super thin and break at nothing. They are not worth it. I highly do not recommend these condoms to anyone that is not ready for a baby.
1,what a waste of money,"with all the hype about Kimono, decided to finally try it out and pay the outrageous amount for it. what a big joke. felt so dry. What a big disappointment. I will stick with my Trojans"
2,Condoms- No No,"Yes, there was no lube. Felt very dry and not the best feeling when inserting. I would recommend having lube when using this product. I was a little disappointed because I hoped that this product would deliver what it promised but it did not. Noooo"
3,IT'S OK...,I bought these to use as back up birth control(I have an IUD) my boyfriend says they feel nice during sex but for some reason it comes off about half the time...so I don't know if your guy is thick/ avg. to large maybe you shouldn't buy this one. Might be perfect if your guy is on the thinner/smaller side though :)
4,just because it's time for new packaging industry wide!,"this condoms are my favorite brand ever; i'm just wanting a 5 star condom to cum? up with a 21st century packaging style that will allow for much easier opening and unrolling. ive got an idea, but you kimono guys are supposed to be the pros to think of these things...other that that, the most reliable thin gauge condom in the business. and amazon keeps em super cheap!"
1,Hanes Briefs,"I bought these to save money. I got what I paid for. I would not do it again.The crotch seam is thick and uncomfortable. One wearing taught me that I did not want them. In fact, I sent the whole package to Goodwill and ended up purchasing some much more expensive panties locally. For me these were not a good buy."
3,love hanes,"love hanes briefs-but buyer beware, these run major small. Get samething at dollar general and same size fits perfect. So, order larger than usual if u buy these."
4,Cotten briefs,"I am very happy with these. A perfect fit, comfortable, arrived quickly with Prime, and reasonably priced. I would have preferred some different colors, not black or prints, but for the most part the colors are okay. I do recommentd them, after all, I'm the only one who knows what the colors are :)"
2,The waistband is too tight.,"I needed more underwear and I thought this would be an easy way to purchase them; however, the waistbands are too tight and are already fraying in the elastic. Not crazy about them, but I have too many now. Can't return them and I buy more."
5,A great fit,"I adore this brand of underwear. Fits to a T without riding, snagging or drooping. I have used this brand for years and it never fails me. Although this may not be considered ""fancy"" underwear, it is incredibly comfortable and lasts for a long time.Recommend washing in cold water to prolong the life of the garment."
2,Item not as shown,"The picture looks great with cheerful spring colors and lots of pink. The seller sends random assorments which do not match the picture. I received solid white, solid black and solid brown. Blah......... I contacted the seller and they cannot control which assortment will be sent to you. Except for the color - a good product."
4,Not Exactly Pastels,"I know the product is good, but I did not receive pastels. I will keep them as they are a present to someone and that person will not know I ordered pastels."
1,Poor Quality,I have purchased Hanes Women's Brief's before and was very satisfied. This recent purchase I found the qualityto be very poor. Materual was very thin.
2,"Not the best fit for advertised product. It comes up much higher then regular briefs,especially sine they carry a higher brief.","Not the best fit for advertised product. It comes up much higher then regular briefs,especially sine they carry a higher brief.Fruit of the Loom has more traditional sizing"
1,They get very large after first wash and do not recover,"It is 100% cotton, but.... They got very large after first wash and do not recover. No elasticity or stretch, but also flabby and shapeless. I will give them away and will buy a quality set. If you care to look sexy, buy some stretch cotton panties. These are grandma pants. Just 2% of spandex with 98% cotton would do wonders."
4,well written,"My copy is @1979 so I don't know what updates may be in this 1990 version. It is enjoyably written but the photographs illustrating the text are less than stellar, quite hard in some cases to make out what is being referred to. The maps are very well done and quite helpful in understanding the waves of invaders to England over years. I now know more about Anglo Saxons in England than I knew before."
4,Reviving Ophelia with an inward look,"I am a female high school student who would fall into the range Mary Pipher has coined, in this book, as ""intelligent girls."" Until I read her book I was confused as to why I felt so insecure and lacked a sense of belonging in social circles, although I have been active in everything I can possibly manage in and out of school. Reading this literature not only helped me look within myself for answers, but it showed me a vivid contrast to other girls' situations through the accounts of numerous girls Ms. Pipher wrote about. I have begun to understand what I, and other young women, go through in the process of growing up, and I am thankful to have had the privelage of reading this book because I can now work on preserving my sense of self and I may hold myself accountable for contiuing to grow in confidence and morals dispite a society ravaged by pressure to be ""perfect."""
4,First Aid or Preventive Medicine,"Mary Pipher gives clear analysis and healthy advice to parents of adolescent girls, teachers and others. ""Reviving Ophelia"" is written with diction that is comprehensible to kids as well as adults, so the subjects of physiological, intrapersonal and social growth can be discussed with girls (or boys). Issues such as sex, drugs, anorexia, bullemia, overeating, bullying, violence, and other delicate subjects are dealt with anecdotally and analytically. I enjoyed reading it, including some parts with my 12-year-old, who has been asking me lots of questions, most of which are talked about in the book."
4,"Reviving Ophelia, Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls","I am a student at Macon State College. I enjoyed reading this book for my Education class. I recommend this book to anyone that will be involved with adolescent girls. Whether your a teacher, tutor, or maybe a peer conselor. The book helped me to realize that all girls are not the same. Every girl goes through their adolescent stages in different ways. This book kept me reading, involved, and I could even relate to some of their changes. I also recommend that parents should read it as well because it could give them some understanding, which would offer some compassion and help when needed."
2,Much needed discussion muddled by political rhectoric,"The topic of the book is extremely important. The objective of the book - understanding the challenges of adolecesents was right on track.The author uses case studies to illustrate the various catagories of problems and situations facing the subjects.Unfortunately, the author blames the bulk of the problems for young girls on society.The bottom line is a call for the government to fix the problems, the very problems that left leaning influence has brought our country.This call for reform is from an author that is herself a left leaning feminist.I had hoped for more help as a parent on how to help growning girls adjust, the author offered little hope that parents could do much.A dissapointment."
3,Some Good Points,"As the title says, Reviving Ophelia does make some very good points (such as how the media feeds girls false images of beauty), but my biggest problem was how the book acted as if all girls become total headcases once they hit 13. I'll admit that my teen years were far from pretty, but you got to give girls a little more credit than that."
4,An insipering book that every teenager should read!,"The book ""Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls"" by Mary Bray Pipher is the kind of book that makes you realize that you're not the only one going through problems. It helps you to deal with these problems and understand the thinking behind them. Many feelings you may find hard to explain. But in this book it helps you put the feelings in words, and know that you are normal to feel this way. Every teenager and parent should read this. It may prove to help start the building blocks of a successful parent child realationship."
5,I think this book helps girls to understand themselves.,"I usually NEVER read, but this book opened my eyes.I am 15 years old, and I have had just about every problem imaginable, I though that I was the only person going through hell as a teenager, but it seems that so many people go through the same kind of problems as I have gone through.I go to therapy twice a week and I didn't understand why I couln't just be normal, but I am learning that I am normal, I'm starting to accept myself.I think that Mary Phiper is an excellent doctor as well as a role model, she is strong, she helps people get through hard times, and she helps them to stay strong."
5,This book is enlightening and should be required for all.,"This book is enlightening in the fact that Pipher teaches us how many adolescent females are pulled from their innocence by the media, and sociey at large. Pipher paints images of several girls and their struggle to survive the hardest stage of life -adolescents. This book is highly recommended to all women -mothers who want to understand their daughters, and women who want to understand their own adolescents. 6 stars."
5,I'm so glad I read this book,"I borrowed a copy from the Library, and after reading the first chapter I purchased a copy so I could highlight and underline the wise advice that this author gives for parenting the adolescent female. I found this book to be enlightening, not only for raising my two (adolescent) daughters, but also for understanding much of what I went through as a teen. Anyone who has a daughter, was a daughter, or cares about a young girl going through adolescence, a most turbulent time, should read this book! I've read it once for myself, and now I'm going to read it again for my girls - with the highlighter! Thank you, Mary Bray Pipher."
3,good yet disappointing,"I chose to read this book off of a reading list from my high school psychology class. While I eagerly turned the pages during the first few chapters, I was less interested by the time I neared the end of the book. The author offers insight into the lives of adolescent girls, and she does an excellent job of showing how society, which she refers to as ""girl-poisoning"", can affect girls at this age. The summaries of her sessions with adolescent girls are informative, yet they become repetitive by the end of the book. Although I feel it is important to help teenage girls who are dealing with depression, eating disorders, a parent's divorce, abuse, harassment, etc, I feel that it is also important to remember that all adolescent girls are NOT like the ones described in this book."
1,Very Disappointing,"As a 16 year-old girl, i resent Mary Pipher's portrayal of girls as victims. It seems that her objective is to get everyone to feel sorry for us poor, stupid girls. I'm sick of people telling me how unfortunate I am to be an adolescent female growing up in the 90's. Every generation has its problems,including Ms. Pipher's. She acts as if no one has ever heard of a teenage girl having problems before now. The truth is that adolescence is hard for EVERYONE, including guys. Sure, some may have a harder time than the rest, but it is silly to assume that this is the case for everyone else. Mary Pipher is just having a little pity party to remind everyone that girls are extremely delicate and should be kept in glass cases on the shelf right next to this book."
3,Not for general reading,"My youngest daughter's counselor loaned us this book when she was in 10th grade. Much of it was unusuable for us, however I have found it is best to learn what you can and use what works for you. There was a lot of information that helped me understand many of the situations that happened to both my girls and why they reacted the way they did. Upon sharing my information with my daughters, they were relieved to know they were not alone in what they endured during middle school years. I now have 2 granddaughters who have arrived at this age. I'm purchasing a copy of this book to refresh my memory and, hopefully, detour some of the downplay of their peers. They are both unique and creative. If nothing else this book helps us to understand some of the things that went on in our lives. Most of the book is pretty heavy, but there is much that can be learned and is quite useful. USE WHAT YOU CAN AND LET GO OF THE REST!"
5,Understanding Adolescent Girls,"I am a college student majoring in education and read this book for a class. Since I also have an adolescent daughter, I found this book to be very insightful. The author, through the use of case studies, gives understanding to the complexities of adolescence. She shares her methods for helping these girls in crisis deal with the world they live in. I would recommend this reading for educators teaching older elementary and middle school girls. I would also recommend this for the parents of adolescent girls. This book reveals how the culture in which girls are raised today greatly influences their attitudes, actions and self-esteem.After reading this book I have a greater understanding of the right of passage called adolescence."
2,Not that great,Dr Pipher's opinions are not referenced very well. Her stories are interesting and probably portray the lives of her clients accurately. I don't think that her presents an unbiased opinion anywhere in the book. I would balance this book with the rest of life.
1,This book was not worth the cover price,"I was anxious to read this book after having it recommened highly to me, but I was very disappointed. The book seemed to be composed mainly of case studies, with no conclusions or recommendations, or even adequate explanations of behavior. There was a lot of talk about the authentic self, which seems a bit of psycho-babble to me. Tell me, what does that mean? All the book did was point out OVER and OVER again that girls are doing unhealthy things and in some unhealthy relationships. I simply have to turn on a TV talk show to see that. How about a little depth? Also, how about not making all those girls out to be VICTIMS. Where is their responsibility in this? If you are looking for a book of substance, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS BOOK"
1,A sad case study into the author's neuroses,"As a therapist, I was intrigued by what such a book would have to offer. Unfortunately, it offers virtualy nothing but a look at the author's own ""demons"" and a biased look at what she thinks a woman should be. The worst thing about the book is that people are reading it and accepting it as fact, when it is little more than baseless opinion. It is unfortunate that so little is written about the female psyche. It is more unfortunate that this book is so widely read."
3,A College View,"This review is being done by a college student. I am a major in education, and read this book for one of my education classes. I found that it was very hard to read. It went back and forth from what Pipher had to say to true stories from girls she has encountered. I personally could not tell when the story ended and where her thoughts began. It also was published in a weird way. I mean, the chapters didn't flow together like they probably should have. I did enjoy reading the book, in spite of the above. It showed me what was going on when I was that age. I was everything those girls were. I really seemed to relate to the girls in the book."
5,How women are changed!,"This book is terrific and if one spends some time reading and considering the situations described it is easy to see why young women, and women of all ages are changed. They are not always changed for the better but hopefully this will give some adult women insight as to why they are as they are and mothers insight as to how difficult growing up can be now a days."
1,is is male versus female opinion on this book?,"perhaps if i was a 18 year old female i could understand the female mindset in this book.but i am not i wasted 3 hours reading this book for my sociology class,what i brought away was not what females in my class did, i find this book repeating, in fact preaching ,i f i want to hear a sermon i will go to church,if this book is the author opinion then she is as far to the left as one can be without being in the pacific ocean.i am a very liberal person but as i said i dont need someone telling me what to think."
1,Does Ophelia NEED to be revived?,"This is the stupidest book I have ever read- including Dr. Seuss! I think that Mary Pipher has some childhood issues that need to be worked out, because she stereotypes girls at a certian age as being something they usually aren't. I really can't say that it was worth the time I spent reading it."
2,Needed some data on teen issues,"This book was of little help....but....Dr. Bradley has a book that I would HIGHLY recommend titled ""YES, your teen is crazy"". This book should be mandatory reading for ANY parent."
1,Reviving Ophelia,"I am an education student who is attending Macon State College. I read this book as part of a class assignment. Here are my thoughts. As a whole I was not very impressed with this book. I found it hard to read especially since it is really not the type of book that I am used to reading. I also find it hard to believe that girls are losing their ""true selves"" during adolesence. I always thought they were trying to find their ""true selves."" I never felt that I lost my true self during adolesence. I did not encounter any huge hardships growing up so I could not relate to the girls in this book with their problems of durgs and teenage pregnancy etc. I do agree that something has gone wrong in society that has caused girls and boys to use behavior that is inappropriate. Or things that have caused them to want to experiment more with drugs, sex, etc. I just don't know that I agree that the problem stems from them losing their ""true selves."""
2,Have a Little Faith!,"If you are a parent who wishes to read this so you can understand your daughter, keep in mind what the author did not: these are exreme cases. Have a little faith in your daughter; the author seems to have little in the female sex as a whole. Most teenage girls, at least none of the ones I know, are weak, desperate, and easily manipulated. In the book, even intelligent girls cannot remain strong enough to withstand peer pressure or the evil media. Girls are ""walking targets"" who have such low self-esteem that they will do virtually anything to be accepted. This book was written almost ten years ago, and maybe things have changed; there's a lot of evidence today that boys are the ones who are in trouble.Maybe the whole commercial ""Girl Power"" movement did the trick. As far as I can see, we weak, troubled, lonely, self-involved teenage girls seem to be doing just fine."
5,Ophelia...terrific!,Excellent book. Extremely informative. I had to read this for a class but would recommend it to anyone with adolescent girls at home or on the verge of becoming!
4,A College Students Opinion,"I read the book, ""Reviving Ophelia,"" written by Mary Pipher for my education class at Macon State College. Being a young women and a sophmore in college I understood some of the stories Pipher described in her book. I enjoyed how she wrote about a person, then gave her professional knowledge, and gave a few more stories that tied into what she was trying to explain. I would recommend this book to many young women, however to women who have or has young teenage daughters. This book was inspiring and very informative."
4,Interesting for the complexity unveiled,"Yes, when I was an adolescent boy I never understood girls. Now I can understand a little better the changes they have to go through and be more understanding. But, from there to be androginous people? Hardly. Boys are boys and girls are girls. Yet we are equal but different, we should learn to tolerate our differences and work together again."
4,A great book for parents and teachers,I am a college student majoring in education and I read this book for a class. This book is wonderful for anyone dealing with adolescent girls. It gives a insight to the problems young girls in today's society in a format that is very easy to read and understand.
5,"Excellent content, easy reading.","I am a college student majoring in education and read this book as a class assignment. I found that this book had a wide scope of information dealing with problems teenage girls face today and it also gave me useful insight in dealing with my own teenage daughter. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a pre-teen daughter, or a daughter experiencing problems at home or school."
4,As a father I found this book very revealing and useful.,"This book has brought to light subjects that I hadn't considered I would be faced with as my eight year old comes of age. It has made me realize the importance and necessity to keep an open dialogue between both of my children. I highlighted several items of intrest and shared them with my daughter while we are still able to talk without a multitude of influences. I feel this book has alowed me the opportunity, to offer her a foundation to a confusing time in our not so distant future."
1,Can we get any further from the truth for average girls?,"I'm a 14 year old college freshman who had to read this book for an orientation class. While I felt that the book might shine a light on the horrors of adolescence for those in worst case scenarios, those who create their own worst case scenarios can gain nothing from it. Parents reading this book should beware: contrary to what Mary Pipher wants you to believe, your daughter probably hasn't done half of what she says all teenage young women do. After the class ended, our entire dorm proceeded to burn/rip the book, showing the general idea that young ""gifted"" girls have toward the work. Parents love it- ""we're evil because we're kids and it's not their fault""- but like most self-help books, it should be taken with a rather large serving of salt."
5,Reviving Ophelia; Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls,"Easy-to-read and concise, this book clearly explains why adolescent girls in our society suffer a multitude of problems such as eating disorders, low self-esteem, underachievement, and substance abuse. Author Mary Pipher, Ph.D. shows us how our society, cultural pressures and the media all play a role in helping to exploit...and destroy...our nation's girls. Anyone with a daughter should and must read this book, then pass it on."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. I realize it was written MANY years ago, but I was saddened to see only a worldly view of raising girls. I was hoping for a more spiritual/Christian standpoint. This book is certainly out of date, but I expected that since it was written in 1994. I do not necessarily agree with all of her diagnosis or interpretations of situations."
1,That's enough for me.,"Quote from the book:""Girls who stay true to themselves manage to find some way to respect the parts of themselves that are spiritual. They work for the betterment of the world. Girls who act from their false selves are often cynical about making the world a better place...Only when they reconnect with the parts of themselves that are alive and true will they again have the energy to take on the culture and fight to save the planet."" (end quote)Save it from what? Your cynicism or your ego?Any book with a paragraph like that in it is going straight in my trash can. Girls are people, not martyrs. Human beings, not tragic fallen angels. And frankly, I prefer to treat them as human beings.I did slog through some of this book. I found it interesting that the girls who were the most inventive, creative, and what I would call ""alive"" were often the girls she considered ""false."" Maybe she just wasn't seeing their true selves because they didn't fit into her tiny little ""ideal girl"" box."
1,Hopefully there are better books for our girls than this ...,"While the book had some insights, I nevertheless found it simplistic, unscientific and disappointing. Whoever gave Mary Pipher her Ph.D. must be cringing. The usual suspects are to blame for the problems plagueing our young girls, including the 'feminist' fan favorite, the 'girl-poisioning' society. If you like this kind of pop psychology, then this book is for you. If you are a more serious reader, then move onto something else and save your money. I particularly like the section in the book where Dr. Pipher mentions that '...she knows very little about [the psychology] of boys...' and then spends the next several pages proving it. It can be argued that growing up today is harder than in previous generations and our young girls need help. Sadly, so does this book."
1,This book offended normal teens such as myself.,This book was very false. It was offensive to normal teens such as myself who don't need to be 80 pounds to be happy. It gave a false image of the normal teen and was more like reading a novelization of Dawson's Creek than a real book.
4,Reach Your Daughters Well,"Reviving Ophelia, written by a Unitarian Universalist (like me) child psychologist, is a revealing look at the issues faced by teenage girls. On the recommendation of a friend who is the mother of a now 19-year old daughter, I read Pipher's case histories of various patients. Appropriate parental response is critical when problems like depression and bulimia surface, lest a beautiful 12-year old (which most are) be lost. Right behind this I read Tom Wolfe's ""Charlotte Simmons"". The years between 13 and 20 are certainly treacherous for a girl."
1,very disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It portrays teenage girls as nothing more than slaves to a male dominated society with no brains of there own. I found it extremely negative, and only focused on teenage girls from dysfunctional families. For more positive reading about teenage girls i suggest the book ""Raising our Athletic Daughters"". That is a book worth reading."
3,Saving The Selves Of Adolescent Girls,"Marys a psychotherapist who works with young girls. She has explained what young females go through at such a young age. She talks about everything from Mothers, fathers, and divorce to drugs and alcohol. It is a great book that would be a great book for parents daughters to read while growing up. It wouldn't solve anything, but maybe if they knew others were going through the same thing they wouldn't hate their lifes as much. She tells exactly what happened in these girls lifes and what was said at their sessions together. She has a great view on teenage girls with such great opinions and information."
5,"Excellent book, but I wish ......",that someone had warned me that it was the same book that was published in the USA the year before.... Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls by Mary Pipher.This one was published in London. Reviving Ophelia: Helping you to Understand and Cope with your Teenage Daughter by Mary Pipher PH.D
2,losts of sad stories-- no useful advice,"Itis frightening to me that so many people find this book helpful. Anyone who found this book helpful should be seeing a therpist and not spending time with a book. The girls in these stories are not typical. You could read this book or you could watch some daytime talk show like Maury Povitch, Phil Donahue, or Jenny Jones - the information is the same. Let's give the majority of our teenage girls some credit please. I see a generation of intelligent,strong self assured women with more going for them any generation before them. Lighten-up."
5,Saving the minds of parents of adolescent girls,"this book gives a great overview of what our children are facing. it was written in the 1990's and refers to that date, however i believe that the truths it holds are even more true today. i found it full of great information that explained alot of things. however, if you are looking for what to do to save them, this book does not really spend too much time on focusing on that though it does go over a couple suggestions briefly. i would highly recommend this book to anyone with children be they teens or not, be they girls or boys the information is invaluable. good luck to all of you out there."
5,Reviving Ophelia:Saving the Selves fo Adolescent Girls,"I am a student majoring in education at Macon State College and I read Reviving Ophelia for a class. I found this book extremely interesting and easy to read. Reviving Ophelia reminded me of some of the struggles I faced while I was an adolescent, such as the constant pressure to be thin and to measure up with what the media considers attractive. The case studies in each chapter were particularly helpful in personalizing the issues that were presented. I believe Reviving Ophelia will be an extremely useful resource in my career because I plan on teaching middle school. This book has made me more aware and sensitive to the daily struggles adolescent girls face. I would highly recommend Reviving Ophelia to anyone who wants to help adolescent girls during this difficult time."
2,Shouldn't Be Necessary.,"This book is rather entertaining, but unless you are someone who has low self esteem and is really struggling with being an adolescent girl, then you probably shouldn't waste your money. Nearly every example in this book deals with a girl who has major problems and isn't a strong, individual person, which is fine, but don't assume this is what most teenage girls are like. Many reviewers have stated that this book has helped them, but- as a fifteen year old girl myself- I was surprised and slightly insulted. However, maybe this book will help you if you're heading in the wrong direction...? What do you think?"
5,"Depressing, enlightening, and thoroughly interesting.","It's amazing to me how quickly the world can change, and that the world that adolescent girls now face is entirely different from when I faced it 10 years ago. As someone who would like to raise children, this book frightened me--the demons these girls must face that the parents must help prepare them to fight are worse than any we had to face in our teenage years. But it also gives hope, sharing many, many stories of girls who went through this most difficult time and emerged intact, as mature, interesting women. A must-read for anyone who works with these young women, or may in the future, or ever was one of them, or is simply interested in our youth and our society. Excellent book"
2,Outdated & Untrue,"Ninety-nine percent of the girls in this book are unitelligent, weak followers. As if this is the average teenage girl! Ms. Pipher was describing her own cases, all psychological messes, but she somehow came to the conclusion that this was how a teenage girl lives her life. Perhaps in repressed farming towns in the Midwest where no one finishes high school, teenage girls live their lives like that, but not most of the population. It was depressing and insulting that she believes teenage girls are so stupid and susceptible. Besides, all that, the references in it to pop culture are about fifteen years old. No, we don't wear green jeans and listen to Prince. Sorry."
5,"Excellent reading for young women, parents and educators","As an education major, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in teaching all grades. The book provides an uncommon picture of common teenage girls and is very thought provoking. Parents (moms AND dads) should read this book whether they have sons or daughters. Mary Pipher does an excellent job of capturing adolescence from all walks of life."
4,Excellent reading for parents with daughters!,"I am a college student and had to read this book for my Education class. This book shows the journey young girls take through adolescence into becoming a young adult. The chapters discuss many influences that complicate young girls lives.It is helpful for parents of, not only girls, but boys too. It could definitly help a teacher understand the teenage girls she is trying to teach."
4,"An inspiring, and helpful book.","I read this book atthe beginning of my senior year in high school, and although it was one of my slower reads - due to an obvious lack of a storyline - it was nonetheless enjoyable, informative, and enlightening."
1,Bad!!!,"This terrible book demonstrated nothing but a way to give a parent paronia. The negative image of teens will make parents feel as though their teen is going to do something horrible. Also, boys have problems, too. This book is overly aprehensive of teens."
2,Pseudo science.,"The author paints a bleak picture of life for adolescent girls. She gives very little (if any) credit to the girls who succeed quite nicely through the tribulations of adolescence. Nor has the author done a statistically valid sampling of teenage girls. Instead, because she works with troubled teens, she assumes that ALL teens suffer these problems. Guess what? If you talk to troubled girls, you're going to find troubles. Wow! What a concept. The case studies in this book are disturbing and touching. You really feel for these girls. They have definitely lost themselves somewhere. Yet, until I see a study of randomly selected girls, I will remain unconvinced that this book accurately reflects the lives of anyone other than these specific individuals."
3,Commonsensical Psychobable,"Pipher conveys valid issues concerning the plight of adolescent girls. The first few chapters were enlightening, a must read for fathers of preadolescent girls. Pipher could have made her point in half the book."
1,You'd be better off roughing it,"I am a 16 year old female who grew up in the 1990's. I had to read this book as a summer reading assignment,and deeply regreted it. I should have just looked up the summary online. This book is slightly accurate, but for most of the adolescent population is humongously off. I wanted to practically scream throught most of the book. I may just be ranting, and therefor being oversensitive at the moment but, have you noticed, she's telling about how girls are pressured to look pretty and girly...and what do you know she puts a blonde-haired, blue eyed girl on the cover. -sigh- That was oversensitivity...sorry. We kind of need to go through these tough times now, because once we get older, it'll get harder to grow a thick skin against others who don't want the best for us. Consider it like getting your ears pierced. As painful as it seems now, it'll hurt more if it is done older. --Dani (on my mom's account)"
4,Very helpful with the attitude of my daughter,I have found this book very insightful with the thoughts and action of my 11 year old daughter. The world is a changed place and very different from when I grew up. Mary has a lot of advice and insight that any parent can find useful.
5,THIS ONE WILL STAY WITH YOU!,"As an 8th grader teacher, I held a lunchtime forum with female students who wanted to read this book and talk about it. We found out LOTS! #1: it's difficult to accomplish during lunch. We needed a longer period of time. #2: We learned much about ourselvesand our parents. #3: We've been passing this book on to other people. It's a geat book to share! I highly recommend it. Wish I could find a comparable book for teen boys."
2,"Read this for the case studies, nothing else.","I found the case studies absolutely intriguing, but as for the commentary on them...well, that was disappointing. Having had a rough time in my teenage years, I thought that I would relate more, or find relief perhaps, in Pipher's explanations. But I did not. I would call her tone along the lines of militant feminism. Granted society screws us up some, but it can't be held liable to the degree Pipher maintains. I am skeptical of a woman from a stable home in a small Nebraska town who creates theories that she claims are applicable to the rest of the US. She seemed to spend her whole commentary time whining about how different the 90s are from the 60s. I think that being a teenage girl really sucks, but Pipher gives me little relief that there is any good thinking and thus progress happening on the subject"
4,A very interesting read from Amazon,"At times it was a bit too technical, but all in all a very interesting read. All Moms of pre-teens should have this. it's well ddesigned and wold be very helpful during those teenage hormone infused years."
5,there is another!,"If you are interested in Mary Pipher's book you should know about the new book!An Excerpt from OPHELIA SPEAKS review on Amazon.Com: At age sixteen, Sara Shandler read Mary Pipher's ""Reviving Ophelia"", the national bestseller that candidly explored the unique issues that challenge girls in their struggle toward womanhood. Moved by Pipher's insight yet driven to hear the unfiltered voices of today's adolescent girls, Shandler yearned to speak for herself, and to provide a forum for other Ophelias to do so as well. ""I compiled ""Ophelia Speaks"" in an effort to give voice for our generation of adolescent girls. I am hopeful that other girls will see themselves in its pages and recognize that they are not alone.""--Sara Shandler"
3,Try not to be judgemental.,"This is an insightful book for women of all ages to read. I think every woman may be able to find a specific reference related to her life in some way. In addition, I would like to comment on the opinion of a reader from San Francisco, California. From what I gathered you did not like the book, however, do not generalize women who live in the Midwest as being ""repressed"" and ""where no one finishes high school"". I have a B.A. and plan on going to graduate school. Get a clue!!!!"
4,Can't Believe it's Out Of Print,"This is a cute, cute book. It has a unique lesson about how sometimes people have to be approached the right way so they won't judge you. It doesn't tell kids to compromise who they are. Super cool illustrations. Too bad it's out of print, get a copy if you can, one that will survive lots of re-readings!"
3,"BERTRAND TAVERNIER, OPUS 4","*** 1977. Co-written and directed by Bertrand Tavernier. One nomination for the French César awards (Jean-Pierre Aumont). Note the discussion between Michel Piccoli and Christine Pascal about Piccoli's precedent film called LA MORT EN DIRECT (Death in Full View (La Mort en direct) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - France], a movie Bertrand Tavernier will direct 4 years later. Another curiosity for us today is the use by Tavernier of several young French actors who would become local stars in the eighties and nineties like Michel Blanc, Gérard Jugnot, Thierry Lhermitte and Christian Clavier. Finally, you'll find social topics and autobiographical inspiration in this film which is not the best of the French director. A VHS version of this movie can be found here:Spoiled Children."
2,Works but batteries stopped charging in two years,Batteries stopped taking a full charge after less than two year. This was bought for an impact driver and it didn't get nearly as much use as my drill but the batteries just don't last.
1,no bunny here,"The battery, charger, and tool it fit (stapler) would have to improve to be worthless. Lo-grade plastic construction is the highest quality part of this junk"
1,Over my head,"I've worked in CDMA ASIC design for 4 years and found most of this book over my head. I agree with another reviewer - it's more like a bunch of conference papers thrown together, I guess that's what you get when you have 11+ authors. If you're working on your PhD in wireless digital communications, then this may be a decent reference. Otherwise, I'd recommend you look elsewhere. (I'm just glad I got a used version that cost me less [money])."
3,"Great looking, but not comfortable","These shoes are beautiful, but unfortunately they are not comfortable. They have no sole support and they are very narrow. So, you should probably go a size up if you want to wear them. I'm disappointed because they are a great looking shoe."
5,Great Book!,"I`m no fan of the American Civil War but I found myself transported by this skillfully written novel. Being a movie fan (and Griffith...) I`ve easily been tempted by the subject matter. The pictures, the recreation of the time, even fictionnal, made this one of my favorite books in the last couple of years. Mr Robertson, keep us informed of what you do!!!"
3,"Well worth reading, good period piece.","The author skillfully transports the reader to the waning days of the Civil War in Washington DC. The descriptive prose is detailed. The thoughts in Booth's head are well constructed and believable, although Mary Surratt's thoughts are somewhat unbelievable. The side story is a throw way. This novel did much to stir my quest for factual knowledge on this subject."
1,nonsense,"I enjoy historical fiction such as John Jakes' novels where the central character interacts with history. Mr Robertson's novel is pure fiction. J Surratt was not a photographer; A Pickerton was not Secret Service. That service began after the assasination. John Surratt was surely guilty, thus his flight. Had he been brought to trial early, he too would have been hung. He certainly was aware of his mother's situation; althought I believe she may have been the only innocent. For readers interested in this plot against Lincoln, they would be better informed reading The Day Lincoln Was Shot by Bishop. Robertson should stick to fiction, without the historical reference which compeled me to select this book."
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"I have read many, many books related to Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Without question, this is the worst. It adds absolutely nothing to our understanding of America's first presidential assassination."
2,a perversion of the historical fiction genre,"Told from the perspective of John Surratt, perhaps, after Booth himself, the least understood of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, Robertson's John Suratt is very much a fictional Surratt, as are all the historical figures presented in the book. While interesting in its depiction of Civil War Washington, ultimately, the book is a disappointment in that the characterizations are flat and stereotypical as Mr. Robertson dispenses with historical truth in search of a good yarn. The Lincoln assassination and its participants can provide enough grist for an enjoyable and plausible historical novel (as Mr. Robertson describes his work) with only marginal manipulation of history; thus the wholesale manipulation of history results in a work that is, at the end, an unconvincing and uncomfortable perversion of the historical fiction genre."
3,Pretty good,"""Booth"" is a charming and well-written look at the time in which Abraham Lincoln lived. It is not important to me that some of the hard facts were massaged a little to allow a novel to be written. Robertson is a professor of the Civil War and there is no reason to believe he has twisted any large political or historical truths here. The author makes it clear he is writing fiction - so cries of inaccuracy are wholly misplaced. The book has the same natural weaknesses that any novel might suffer from: at times trite, wooden language and sub-par character development."
5,true country music,"This is what real country music is...I have really enjoyed listening to all of his music. My favorite song is Country Bumpkin, but all of the songs are good. I have already wore out the cassette tape that I had, this is why I ordered the CD this time."
2,Newer Recordings,"These are newer recordings from Cal that show him to still be in good voice. However, Country Bumpkin is a re-recording. I believe with a better song selection this Cd would have been great, but this is still worth checking out. Plus it's not like there is an over-abundance of Cal Smith recordings available these days."
4,country bumpkin,"I find this CD to be of very good quality I also would like to find Cal Smith I believe he is my father and would like to meet him. I do not want to cause a problem would just like to see him and yes I do look very much like him. thank you very much,Mark Jones. P.S. I would hope that Amazon.com would like to help me find my father or give me a address where I might reach him Thanks Again"
4,The First I.D. and Price Guide For Bobbing Head Dolls !,"A very nice 160 page book, featuring more than 250 large,sharp black and white photos, with an 8 page full color section. Major topics run from collecting tips; repairs- what to look for; condition; and more. The Japanese-made dolls in the fields of baseball, football, hockey, basketball and non-sports are well documented for the period 1960 to 1972 and 1972 to the present.

Each doll includes identifying features, years of manufacture, set profile, typical flaws, historical notes,the most difficult doll to find in the series, and the most common doll in the series. If you're interested in this topic, this book belongs in your library."
5,Best investment I ever made!,I've been using an electronic cash register for over 14 years and have been manually entering my sales figures into my accounting. QuickBooks Point of Sale is GREAT! My sales totals now go automatically into my accounting. The cash register is also so easy to use and is very professional. I love it. Definitely worth every penny.
3,Won't do layaway,"This system is priced very well and it has many functions however one thing it won't do is layaway. I can't comment on the product as a whole since I returned it when I discovered it can't process layaways. QB suggested I create a customer charge account for each layaway (I would need QB 2002 for this) to handle layaways but other POS systems accomodate layaways so I will have to purchase a different system. I was also suspicious of Intuit from reviews of other quickbooks users of other QB products who cited numerous customer service issues, lack of support, and some very customer unfriendly upgrades."
5,Loved it,e was recommended by a friend and it took me a few pages to get into it but after that I couldn't put it down. Loved it!
4,An educational but fun read,I read this for a Principles of Advertising class. It was a fun peek at what the Advertising text books don't tell you. It also helped me to see more or less the relationships within an advertising agency and the hierarchy.
4,Read before doing,"The doing is a carer in advertising. Most of the important aspects of this book have been covered in other reviews, what I want to add is that when young people are making career choices--the field they will enter--they should think about the kind of people that will be surrounding them. If you're thinking about marketing, this book gives you a real idea, the good and the bad...."
5,Give Me More E,"This book is laugh out loud funny. I work in the ad business and it is such a great encapsulation of some of the goings on and delightfully wicked characters this business attracts. I read the book on a few flights and Beumont had me laughing out loud, regardless of the people around me. I was sorry when the book ended. If anyone knows some other titles of a similar ilk, please leave a review with details. Failing this I'll be keeping an eye peeled for Beumont's next effort. Well done."
3,e-Mazing - Maybe......,"""e"" is a good book - an easy one to devour in one or two sittings, a great beach companion. The book is written consisting entirley of emails between employees at an Ad agency. A new approach to writing (as far as I know) and not entirely unsuccessful. The charcter development is good. I got a real feeling of hate/love for some of them. Although in the beginning I had to keep turning back to previous pages to see who had written what to whom. I would warn that there is a lot of English-ness in this book for US readers. It weaves a lot of the story around famous english/european people who most Americans will never have heard of - ""Little & Large"", ""Reeves & Mortimer"", ""Gloria Hunniford"" etc. Overall a good book if you have a few hours to kill on a plane, beach, car ride."
2,"Clever Writing Style, Fails as a Satire","e is a clever novel that attempts to be a satire of a London ad agency. It is told entirely in e-mail format, and in that it succeeds by using a very clever, modern device to tell the story. Kudos to the author for his originality.For me, however, this novel fails to entice. You have the loony left wing creative talent unwilling to work on controversial accounts, you have the generally nutty creative director, the sexually predatory male cohort, backstabbing and backbiting galore, cat fights among personal assistants, and a big boss who is an abusive terror. While I know many people who found this book funny and entertaining, I didn't. I actually found it rather boring and predictable once the story took off. There are parts that are funny, and sometimes subtly so. But overall, I just didn't find the story itself that funny or original.For the clever writing style this novel is definitely an A, but the story itself is unappealing to this reader."
2,Not For Me!,"Do you believe that advertising agencies are somehow glamourous or intigueing? Are office politics and rumours interesting to you? Do you like office gossip?When I bought this book, I thought it was going to have more substance. I know we're only supposed to criticize the content, but it doesn't have much!"
4,Hilarious!,"This book is a riot! It has everything...sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, and plenty of back-stabbing. I laughed all the way through it. I can hardly wait to get my hands on ""The E Before Christmas"". Happy reading!"
5,Kept the Sydney to LA flight awake for hours!,"I bought this book while on a trip through Australia and actually read it twice during the two weeks I was there, it was so funny! I haven't read anything this clever and hilarious in ages! Definitely worth the price of admission!!! Working for a large corporation and being held hostage by e-mail myself, it hit almost too close to home. And, although I'm not in accounting, I'll be at BZ at 6 if anyone wants to join..."
4,A good resource for exploring the Natchez Trace.,"As frequent users of the Off the Beaten Path series, this is a good companion book for exploring the Trace."
1,Not the best study aide,"I bought some REA's books like AP US history, and i liked it because of its indept review of EVERYTHING, however i was very dissapointed in this book of AP biology. This book doesnt give in-depth review of Biology concepts for the exam. It is very brief and covers the whole concepts in less than 100 pages. Not the best review, and their practice questions arent that great neither, i recommend Cliffs AP, or Princeton Review."
1,Not Great,"This book is not very helpful in preparing for the AP Test. This book does not go very in depth in reviewing and its practice tests do not really help you study because it makes you focus on obscure aspects rather than the important topics covered on the AP exam. Also, there were some errors (i.e. incorrect diagrams that have nothing to do with the question in the essay explanation). The Cliffs AP book is soooo much better. It has a great review and it really helped me study for the AP test."
4,Beginners Start Here,"A well laid out publication, with easy to understand instructions. Samples are clear. Practice hints are invaluable. The Tables on Threads, Batting etc. are an added bonus for beginners who are unsure of these finer details. Highly recommended."
5,No more hesitation!,"After viewing amazing art quilts for years at fairs and exhibits, I wanted an attempt at my own. This book was recommended in more than one place, so I chose it along with three other art quilt books. This, by far, has been the most useful tool in my new hobby of machine quilting. Ms. Noble makes it easy to follow each of the steps to get you quilting. One part of this book that stands out is the small tips & hints peppered throughout her succinct text. Also, I am sure the threads and materials grids have saved me hundreds of dollars in ""testing"" thread and accessories.As a mom of twins with her own business, I never thought I'd find the time to quilt - however, this book is so well done, it inspired and coached me to a proud result (see customer images). Thanks to Maurine Noble!"
3,Informative.,It has loads of information on Machine Quilting. It feels a little more advanced for beginners. Perhaps when I reach that stage of efficiency this book will come in handy.
5,Love to Quilt,I purchased this book several years ago and find it is an excellent teaching tool for machine quilting. A friend borrowed it and also loved it so I ordered her one on Amazon. It arrived within 3 days and she started reading and practicing from the easy steps in the book. I have a feeling others in my quilt group will ask me to order a copy for them.
4,Machine Quilting made Easy,"I think the book is very good. It gives you detailed instructions on how to do a quilt. I have not tried quilting yet, but it seems like it would not be to hard to do."
4,machine quilting made easy,"it is very good, I like the excerises that gives me an opportunity to try the techniques and keep a sample."
5,Muy complacido,"Seria maravilloso poder expandir a latinoamerica la opcion de comprar, yo actualmente realizo las compras por medio de un familiar en los Estados Unidos, pero es muy buena la calidad de los articulos a la venta"
4,Another Classic from Death Metal Masters,"Every Immolation album just evolves to another level. The reason I gave this album a 4 instead of a 5, is that I feel the mixing of the album was not to the same high standard as the songs. Musically it is masterful, and a must have for any death metal fan. What I love about this album, is that the songs go beyond the status que of standard death metal with more hooks and structure than just excessive speed. Kick ass!"
3,soso.,"this is the only time immolation almost dropped the ball. this album retains that desolate, forsaken atmosphere and the crawling dissonant leadwork signature of immolation, but they somehow lost confidence in the riff department and just composed a classy, harmonically rich bolt thrower-esque death metal album with no melodic subtext or nuance. consequently this is immediately emotionally engaging material, but in time fades out of consciousness like a pop album. 3.5/5, rounded down because honestly now."
3,Or you could re-read Call of the Wild,"Anthologies are, by their nature, often uneven - and this one bears (Polar, Kodiak etc.) that out. Dana Stabenow (author of the Kate Shugak & Liam Campbell Alaskan Mystery Series) gathered a bunch of writers for a Left Coast Crime Convention in February, 2001 from whence sprang this only-in-paperback-and-understandably-so book.What was the generally environmentally conscious Stabenow thinking? Unlike Mary Higgins Clark presents The Plot Thickens, proceeds from which fight illiteracy in America, there is no explanation for this book. Some of these stories are pretty good: those from Sue Henry, Fr. Brad Reynolds, James Sarafin and, of course, Stabenow herself. Most of the rest are a pity to the poor trees sacrificed to print them. At best, it is ""flight fodder"" for a long plane trip. Reviewed by TundraVision."
2,Too slow and heavy...,"I never liked Böhm into Schubert symphonies because he doesn't feel this composer the way it should be with an Austrian spirit. It's deadly slow and heavy like some German music, especially in the ""Unfinished"" symphony, the most famous one.For Schubert I advise Josef Krips or Karl Münchinger. Giulini made a nice reading of the ""Unfinished"" symphony on DG too.Blomstedt is good also."
2,A bit slow?!?!?,"I do agree that the sets from the likes of Beecham and Abbado can be a bit too light and shallow, but Bohm is the complete opposite; he conducts not just at a snail's pace but with a weight of an elephant, and turns the delightful, charming and witty tunes of Schubert into a funeral march. There's a very big difference between adding more drama and depth into Schubert and changing the nature of his music although. His 9th is a very good one, but his other effort, especially his 5th, can be a chore to listen too. For a set that's heavier than Beecham's and Abbado's but not as heavy as Bohm's I highly recommend Wand's and Blomstedt's set, Blomstedt in particular conducts with broad tempos like Bohm but is much more lively and intelligent."
4,Great story,"I have all the Virginia Rich and Nancy Pickard books in this series. Cozy, yet current. Wonderful Christy-like plots and good continueing characters."
5,Another Amazing Album,"This afternoon I recieved the newest brilliant cd by Seven Nations. Guys, you have done it again! Throughout the evolution of this band they have never failed to exceed my expectations. As I'm listening to this I am filled with happiness and admiration. I can hardly describe the way I feel but believe me when I say that if you have liked ANY other Seven Nations cd, you'll love this one. It is amazing and won't dissapoint! The wait was well worth it gentlemen."
3,Not my favorite,"I've tried to collect all of Seven Nations CD's . . . and I have to admit, while I like some tunes on this CD, it is not one of my favorites. I'd say - if you're making a collection of Seven Nations, buy it to complete your collection, but I think you'll find better CD's of theirs. Anything of Seven Nations is worth listening to!"
2,"Disappointing, Thanks","Seven Nations' Thanks for Waiting lacks the high energy and power of the band's previous works. The album seems more pop than rock, and the Celtic elements, which drew me to the band in the first place, are not as prominent on this album.There are a few great tracks, such as ""Slow Air"". Several other tracks start out promising but don't deliver by the end. The collection of songs is more diverse in style, but it makes the album as a whole feel somewhat disjointed. Scott Long's fantastic pipes are lost on many tracks, and Dan Stacey's fiddle work on the album doesn't fully demonstrate his exceptional skill.I have been a huge fan of Seven Nations for many years. I am warily waiting for their next album with high hopes.Recommended: Seven Nation's The Factory"
3,"Great fiddle, but where'd the pipes go?","7N is clearly in a transition away from bagpipe filled rock. They still have one of the best fiddlers of any contemporary celtic band (this guy alone is worth a listen), the lyrics are still engaging, and the music is still hook-laden. However, I can't seem to escape the fact that what set them apart was a ripping set of pipes. This album has one instrumental interlude with pipes. One can't help but assume that 7N is just throwing older fans a bone. Still an enjoyable album, but a real disappointment from their zenith with The Factory."
5,Great comics by Jaffee,"Tall Tales is a book of one page comics that Jaffee did for newspapers prior to becoming famous at Mad Magazine for his Fold Ins and ""Snappy Answers"". The comics are really great, and show off the wit and genius that Jaffee has. He can do more in one page than other artists can do in an entire book. If you are a fan of Mad or Al Jaffee then you will definitely love this book. It is called 'Tall Tales' because of the size of the book, instead of multi page comics, they are all on long vertical strips. So instead of looking 'across' the page to get the joke you have to look 'up and down'. It is a fast read obviously, but well worth it."
3,I hoped for more,"Loved the Arthur series, but was disappointed in this one. Never finished it. Poor character development."
4,4 and 3/4,"While I am a fan of Cornwell's books based in much earlier ages, and not much of a fan of his american history based series, this one is a BIG exception.This is a wounderfully told story that captivated my attention early in the book and held it throughout - realistic and slightly disreputable hero much like the characters who are heros of the founding of our country ..... Washinton, Jefferson, Franklin, etc.... who ends up serving his country despite himself... ala Carey Grant in Gone with the Wind.... sort of character....Like I said, generally I do not recommend Cornwell's american history based books.... This one is an exception ..... DON'T MISS THIS BOOK.... it is truly an original story by one of the best story tellers out there."
2,Disappointed in this book.,"The book jacket ends with this quote, ""Gallows Thief combines the rich historical of ... and the taut suspense of ... to create an eviscerating portrait of capital punishment in nineteenth century London"" This is my first of his books and he wastes his considerable story-telling skill on his oposition to inherited wealth and capital punishment.The 'evil' characters lack any depth, the poor and lawless are 'better' than the upper classes. His descriptions of the evils of Newgate Prison, guards and executioners goes on and on.I've just started reading historical mysteries and am really enjoying them - disappointed in this one."
4,A Romp by Cornwell.,"Mainstream historical fiction writer Bernard Cornwell gives us a romp this time, and a good one. This is in essence a detective story set in London, full of likeable good guys, adorable female sidekicks, annoying male sidekicks and not so intelligent bad guys.The setting and descriptions are exceptional. You feel you are next to Ryder Sandman trying to solve the mystery. This does not have the roaring battle scenes we are accustomed to see in Cornwell's books, but have plenty of action and twists.If you like historical fiction and are looking for a little light entertainment you will enjoy Gallows Thief."
5,Excellent!,"I truly enjoyed this book. If you like historical fiction - get this book! Mr. Cornwell really makes history come alive with the story of the Newgate prison, the politics and class divisions of early 19th century England and, if you are a cricket fan, this book is definitely for you!I hope this is the first in a series of books with the same characters; they are very well developed and the ending is primed for a sequel. Also, I would really like the stories of some of the secondary characters to be told (especially Sally's Highwayman brother)."
3,The 1st Detective,"A good yarn from the best historical fiction writer around. This book manages to blend a crime mystery, post Napoleonic war society commntary, a essay on the beginnings of the rights of the accused and some good old English humor all at once. I enjoyed this book and it was a page burner. I hope to see some follow on stories about the protagonist."
2,A good book for the beach... and not much else.,"This novel is long on period detail, full of amusing slang from the London underworld of the 1800's, replete with stock characters and is the kind of story you forget almost as soon as you've read it. Having authored the incredibly engrossing and believable Richard Sharpe novels, and some other series not as good, why Bernard Cornwell ventured into the field of ""period"" mystery is the real mystery.He is a much better writer than this novel would have a first time reader of his work think. Altogether the kind of book that you'd take to the beach. If you lose it in the sand and don't get to finish it, no big deal. One thing: If you're interested in cricket, the game not the insect, you're going to learn more about it than you ever wanted to know. (For a better explanation of this unique game, I'd recommend ""How I Won the War"" by Patrick Ryan, which has the added advantage of being humorous.)"
4,Introduction to Critical Thinking & Creative Problem Solving,"Thinking is a very big topic. I have used this book for 10 years in a course that introduces freshmen and sophomores to use their minds to think. The book is easy to read and does not demand a lot of study time from readers. Consequently, students have more time to think about the problems at the end of each chapter. My students rate the book highly for the purpose of serving as an introduction."
1,The Exclusion of Art From Thinking: A Guide to Critical BS,"As a Freshman in college enrolled in a critical reading and writing course, this book was one of my assigned readings. I found the book insulting to my intelligence, and totally unhelpful. The author tries to teach the reader how to use logic and facts and to throw out all emotions, to become a creative thinker. In my experience, emotions are the essence of creative thought, and excluding feelings from a person's work is detrimental to the final product."
2,don't take this class,"i took critical thinking, what this book was the textbook for, and it's been a stupid class so far a lot of b.sif i had chance to reconsider i wouldn't take this class again."
2,Very bad conditions of book,"I was very disappointed by the conditions of the book, edges were all bended, it had A LOT of highlights and it looks like somebody dropped a cup of water on top of it. The book in itself is good and it was very good ideas."
5,Great book,"This book arrived early!! I was happy because I needed it for class. It's a good read too, for a great price."
3,For a class I was teaching,"Didn't like the activities and now I'm not teaching the class. Product support was good, it just didn't match my style."
1,Could critical thinking textbooks explain poor thinking skills?,"This book was assigned when I was in college eight or nine years ago. I wasn't impressed with it then, and rereading bits of it now showed me I was right not to be.Two examples, he has a section on free will and determinism. It seems he has never heard of compatibilism, the dominant philosophical view, and doesn't actually understand determinism. The real problem though is that he tells us we should believe in free will because it is necessary for us to have control over what will happen and what we believe.Now really, telling people to believe X because it would be really useful if X is true? That is critical thinking?The other example, this one really bothered me when in college, he tells us that it is really sophisticated to realize that things don't have to be just good or bad. They can be really bad, kinda bad or some where in between. What? That is sophisticated? Maybe if you are a third grader."
3,"A textbook for beginners and undergrads, and I want to read the instructor's manual instead","I didnt know it's a textbook. The one thing I hate the most is that you always have tons of questions (approx 1/5 of the 270 content page) but no answer. How frustrating! On the other hand, the author had over stretched himself to cover both critical and creative thinking. Honestly, I found his writing boring. For advanced readers on critical thinking, ""Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking by Neil Browne"" and ""101 Philosophy Problems by Martin Cohen"" are much better. On creative thinking, ""even"" most of de Bono's books are better than this."
1,A Little Truth in a Junk Heap,"A less than vigorous mind might be vitiated for life by what is found in this book. It is my hope that with the numerous works available on this subject by logicians and philosophers, few will find their way to this book."
1,Not As Advertised,"Con: The book provided was not like new and free of highlighting as advertised; rather, the book is dingy, most of the pages were stuck together from a coffee spill (I'm hoping it is coffee), and pages are highlighted. I've separated all of the pages but I do wonder sometimes what I am touching. The highlighting is less of an issue because I highlight textbooks.Pro: The seller is polite but refutes my observations. After a couple of emails the seller offered to discount the book or accept a return. I appreciate the gesture but I need the book for school. The offer of a discount is kind but not worth the complications of changing the original order.Lesson: Rather than try to change anything, I'll accept the lesson learned and make future purchases with this experience in mind."
2,it's only 'thought' if vincent says so,"this is a rather interesting book, but the writer hardly practices what he preaches about objective thinking. there are also instances in the text where he lashes out at the reader to shelter his ego. this latent hostility disguised as a scholarly publication enforces a message: if you disagree with me, you're not only wrong, you're a jerk too.thank goodness, meanwhile, that not everybody in this world strives to develop the author's ayn rand class of thinking. the very suggestion that humans should suppress thoughts that aren't 'noble' smacks of orwell. somehow, fortunately, the human animal never caught on to being stony and emotionless. did the author ever consider that passion might actually be a valuable survival tool to the human animal?it's an okay text to get your mind busy, but it's the wrong one to turn to for creative or objective thinking."
4,Honeywell HZ-2200 Mini Tower Surround,"This is a great heater for small areas, not to be used for a large area or more than 2 rooms. Well worth the $$$!"
2,Not what I was looking for in a heater.,"I bought this heater, thinking it was from a better company and had more watts than my previous heater. I must say that I am buying this heater for my outdoor patio, here in Florida, for when the temps drop into the 60's or 50's at night, before it actually goes lower, later, into the 40's or 30's. It maybe a 360 degree heater, but not a strong forced heat, so maybe a good heater for small indoor areas but not for my needs. I was sitting outside in 70 degree weather and turned this little heater on full blast and couldn't even feel the heat at all. I know most of you northerners are thinking, is she crazy, but once you get used to our weather, I guess your blood thins, lol. So for my needs here, I will be returning the heater, but it may make a excellent heater for someone's office space etc."
5,Heater Review,Rcvd in excellent condition. This was a birthday present for my Mother-In-Law and she liked it.
1,Don't bother,We purchased this to heat a small area and it blows out cold air. Packed it up and returned it.
5,Completely met the need,For 23 bucks it was completely worth it. It heats the room we are in so much that we went from halfway up on the dial to less then that. We have still not found the perfect setting but it consistently keeps us warm at night. It is noisy about as much so as our air conditioner. Do not get this if you mind white noise as it will bother the hell out of you. My SO needed something to sleep through the night and this met that need. She now no longer complains about being cold unless we do not turn it on.
1,honeywell hz2006tgt similar model to hz2000,"got a honeywell model hz2006tgt mini tower surround heater. After several usage, it melted the thermostat control knob and melted the surface of the unit as well. I called the warranty service and it turned out that I had to pay for 16 dollars to ship it back in order to get a replacement. They quoted me the warranty agreement and would not cover my shipping cost. I had enough and told them I will not mail it back. However, if you are planning to buy it, please be advised, this product is fire hazard to your house or property and consumers have to spend money shipping it back before they will issue the recall."
1,Waste of money,"This is a total peice of junk and a complete waste of money don't bother with it. It shuts off after just a few minutes and won't turn back on untill it's cooled down for 20 minutes, then turns off again after just four or five minutes. Totally stupid design and an overall dissapoinment."
4,Does what I need it to,"This little unit works very well in my bedroom and heats up very quickly just on the low setting. In the living room I've used it on the high setting and it also works pretty quickly. I use this unit when I am the only one who is cold and don't want to use the central heat. I really like the option to use 360/ front function and the thermostat capability. As per the directions, you turn on the unit with the thermostat on full heat and when the temperature is as hot as you want you slowly turn it down until the unit clicks off. Then it will automatically shut on and off to keep that temperature. My only complaint, which is why I didn't rate the unit 5 stars, is that it is too noisy for me. I mostly wanted this unit for nighttime use and when the unit clicks on and off it wakes me up."
2,Melted itself open,"I bought this heater last year and used it all winter very happily. It worked very well and kept my computer room comfy and warm.This year i brought it out to use, plugged it in and on the second day it started turning off on me after about 3 min of use. I unplugged it and let it cool off since it got amazingly hot after that 3 min and i discovered the black, round casing with the holes in it that goes around the top, had melted itself open in the back.I loved this heater last year but can only give it 2 stars due to longevity."
2,it's melted itself,"It's warm for small room. I used it for almost 7months and, one day it ""melted"" itself :( may be because I turn on it too long..."
1,Just does NOT do the job!!,"Normally a big fan of all Honeywell products, I am very disappointed in this Surround Tower heater. It just does NOT do the job, even in therelatively small office area in which I have it set up. Not enoughheat output to take the chill off, let alone supply a heat source fora small room. Do not waste your money--"
2,Designed to fail,"Well, the bottom line is this: heat rises, right? We've all learned that in science class. The connectors for the heating elements are at the TOP. That means that every time this unit turns on, it's baking the wires that power the heater. It doesn't take long for the wires or the connectors to fail and the unit to quit working.Buy this and you'll be buying another one very soon."
2,Waste of money,This unit heats itself up but the fan doesn't carry heat very far. It took a while to heat up a room. Then it breaks within 4 months?? lol this thing is not that great. I bought the Holmes HFH442-UM Heater Fan and it has worked out much better.
1,Honeywell HZ-2200,"Not so hot. I made a mistake buying this one. The idea of surround heat is good. But this model doesn't throw a lot of heat. Draws too much current. Degrades in efficiency very quickly in a short time. And is next to impossible to keep clean. It starts it's life OK, but goes downhill quick. Save your money, choose another model."
2,"Good features, but doesnt get the main job done","I bought this product because of the Honeywell brand and star rating. This heater has some well thought features included, but on the whole it fails in its objective. You wont feel the heat from this thing unless you 'tent' around it. I live in Chicago, and this thing doesnt work well enough to fight the cold. Buy something better."
2,not much power to it,"ok, my expectations may be too high, but i have a 20 year old 1500 watt heater from sears that produces a lot of heat. this mini tower did not throw off much heat. most of the heat came from the top of the heater, not out the 360degree vents. i placed it in a 10 x 15 room with low ceilings and after an hour idid not feel an appreciable difference in room temp. our little sears heater gets the room sooo hot after only 10 minutes. maybe the new heaters are safer though. can't start a fire easily with this little heater. good safety features and easy to use.i ended up returning it in search of something that produces more heat. this would be good in a really small space like a bathroom."
1,the thermostat flaw,"this thing is basically good for about 10 minutes.the thermostat thinking the room is hot is one of the most annoying things ever.i wish i could find the thermostat and disconnect it, but i can't.it worked fine for about 1 month. no real thermostat issues.then one day, it wored like total garbage.buy something else.. this is not worth $20"
4,good heater,if you want to heat your small room; it is a good heater to do so. the only thing is that it is little noisy
1,After less than a month it died!,This product serverly dissappointed me! It shuts off while you can still see your breath and then within a month it completely died on me! I will never ever again buy this particular heater!
1,Very Poor. Keeps cutting off,Heater do not stay on. This product definitely do not meet my expectation. Love all the honeywell products that is why i thought this one would be great. Unfortunately it was not.
2,weak heater,"With the door closed in a small area (bedroom), the unit struggled to produce any measurable benefit. The unit was heating air, but heat was rising straight up from the unit. After a cold night we returned it and purchased an electric blanket and a quartz heater which we love.On the plus side, this unit is overbuilt for safety. The elements are encased in a mesh grill, and the unit will turn off if tipped over. Unfortunately, it just doesn't produce as much heat as I wanted."
4,"Heats Well, Inexpensive, Looks Nice; but Noisy","This fan/convection heater is inexpensive, easy to use with well placed controls, is only 6 lbs and easy to carry from room to room, looks nice, and works well. Downsides of this heater are that it is relatively noisy and there is no handle to carry it."
4,Great product but could use a few tweeks,"I bought this space heater for my bedroom, which is relatively small. It is great at it's job. It definitely gets my room warm and keeps it that way. The only two things I would change about it are !) It should have a digital thermostat so you can set a specific temperature instead of the guessing game of the dial setting and 2) It should cycle on and off even when on a high setting. When it is on a high setting it will stay on and spew out hot air all night. You'll wake up with cotton mouth if you don't set it low enough so it'll cycle on and off but high enough that it will stay warm. All in all I give it a 8 out of 10 stars."
3,Heater tower,"Nice small size. Does the job. I think its noisy though. At lower voltage it can cause this additional buzzing noise. My room mate doesn't think it's noisy, so it can be a matter of opinion."
2,I would shop for others:,"I have this heater in my bedroom and I am looking for another heater, one that works better. You can hardly feel the fan blowing at all on mine, just the radiant heat. I have to be touching it or nearly touching it to get warm and the temperature in my bedroom only goes up about 1 degree after running throughout the night.(Not on a high setting, just running on the setting I had it on which is at most about one third of the way.) If you turn the setting more than about a third of the way it will run most of the time and not shut off which uses a lot of electricity. It seems pretty safe and warms up good if you are close to it but I am going to look for another one. My main dis-like is I can't feel any blown air and it is probably using too much electricity and I am still not warm enough."
3,Not too bad,This seems like a not too bad heater. Got this as my rooms tend to get cold. But it wasn't something I expected.Pros:- Pretty hot.- Thermostat.- Overpacked with safety features (probably the safest heater on the planet :D )Cons:- Lack of airflow.This thing acts more like a radiator. I don't know why they even put the fan inside as it produces noise but not much air. It's good at keeping a temperature in a room but can take some time to actually warm it up.
3,Small Space Heater,"This is a good little heater, but it does not heat up rooms that are over 400 sq ft. It does heat up a room that's about 150 sq ft, quickly and evenly. I bought it for the room above the garage, but it didn't fare that well. Only heated a small area around the heater, so I to keep moving it around the room."
4,Awesome product,"This is one of the best room heater I could get at this price. The unit is compact and good for use in small-medium size room. It is a little noisy but other advantages like light weight, good heating capacity, good safety measures, and price makes it a good product to buy."
4,Moni Tower Honeywell Sourrond Heater,The 360 degree Surround Heaters work extremely well. My only disappointment was that the older surround heater I own has a switch that allows for changing from surround to front heat only. This adjustment switch was good because it allowed the consumer to determine where the heat was most needed. The newer heaters do not have this switch. Maybe Honeywell should reconsider that feature. The heaters are cost effective and really last.
2,Was nice while it lasted,Was great for 2 years and it just recently burned up. The thermostat dial melted and a there was a terrible burning plastic smell. It would not turn off. I guess the thermostat went bad. Too bad...I really liked it before that. Heated my bathroom during bathing time and didn't make the room too hot.
5,3 yrs Old and Still Warms,"I own one of this space heaters, and just came by to buy another one. It does warms the bedroom or the living room. The home I rent heater broke, and the temperature inside the house was 45 degrees. My daughter used this space heater in her room, and her room was warm and toasty (she does not have an electric blanket)."
3,No 180 degree option,"The description states that the heater has the option of 360 or 180 degree heat. Apparently they've changed the heater to no longer have that option -- it's always 360 degree heat now.The manual says nothing about a front-only heating option, and there's no control for it on the heater. Compared to the amazon image, the heater I received is missing the little tab sticking up in back, and there's a rectangle on the back of the unit that looks like it might have been a space for a switch, but now it's just filled with a block of plastic."
2,Setting starts at 60 degrees,"This sounded like the perfect heater for me. I needed a heater with an automatic setting just to keep a small room above freezing the water pipes in the winter. As soon as I read the manual I discovered the lowest setting for this heater is 60 degrees, so I returned it."
2,Suddenly Stopped Working,"This heater worked fine the first winter when I purchased it, but when I pulled it out of the closet the following winter it suddenly stopped working after using it for about a month."
2,Heats nothing,I got this after reading some good reviews. I found this unit to look good but thats all I can say good about it. The unit turns on and starts to heat and then shuts off. It stutters on and off but doesnt stay on long enough to heat my little bathroom I intended it for. I read the instructions over and over thinking I was missing something about the thermostat. I followed the instructions and still the same results. This heater also claims to be a 360 degree heater but I can only feel alittle heat coming straight out the front of the unit. I moved the unit to a larger room but it still worked the same and heated nothing. Also the unit has a fan only mode but that also does nothing. Even on the highest setting you can hardly feel the air.
3,Theory is good,I really like the fact that it is 360* and is not just one direction or oscillating. It just does not seem to put out enough heat to heat a whole bathroom good. I bought the first one for our living room which has a tile floor. We put it between the two recliners and it keeps the chill off. An elderly lady I care for needed a heater for the bathroom to take the chill off (she needs it 80+ degrees instead of 77). It just doesn't quite do the job for that.
1,WARNING! - DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD!,"Honeywell claims that this space heater has a shut-off safety mechanism when it tips over. Well, it only works if it tips forward or backward. If it tips over on either side, it will continue to run. Being that it has a cylindrical shape, if it tips forward or backward, it can roll to a side position and start running again. Therefore, I would not recommend this item to anyone with small children or pets."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,The unit is very noisy and consumes a lot of electricity. Try to avoid this and buy radiant heater instead if you can.
1,Noise and poorly made,"If you're a hard sleeper, then this may be ok. But if like most folks the noisy fan will wake you up all night. The fan rubs against the internal frame is is poorly designed. The thermostat is so sensitive it clicks on and off every few seconds. Keep looking..."
2,Tip over switch bad design,"I can't believe Honeywell made such a nice heater, that you can tip over sideways and won't turn off! The tip over switch is a pendulum that can get stuck in the OK position if the heater is tipped sideways. If you tip it forward or backwards it works."
1,Dangerous At Best,"I purchased this heater and unboxed it yesterday. I plugged it in, turned it on, and then turned my back for a moment. After a few seconds, it became apparent the fan wasn't operating, and something smelled like hot electronics. A quick check of the controls gave the heater just enough time to start to burn, producing a nice cloud of very acrid smoke that stunk up the entire house. If it had waited another 5 minutes to fail, I probably would have been out of the room, and it could have started a serious fire. Avoid at all costs! As a firefighter, I should have known better than to buy a cheap heater, especially without doing any research. These things cause fires all the time. Spend the extra money and get a Holmes or Lasko, at least those aren't so likely to destroy your house."
3,Consumer reports scores well,"Consumer reports gives this a very high rating among space heaters. I have not noticed anything particularly special about it, but it seems to be doing the job. Time will tell, I think... alot of space heaters we've had just die out after a season or two it seems... will have to see how this guy holds up!"
5,Genuine Prince live,Prince live is the best posible funky music. Very good musicians and very good Prince. It is absoluttly recommend for all Prince fans.
4,What A Performer!,I saw Prince in concert several months and can't stop thinking about how great a Performer he is. I've watched this DVD many times...it's great!
4,Prince,going back to once roots is not only reggae music but the philosophie behind the new fashion reated by Niang mamour
4,Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound.,"This is an extended edition of Elvis Presley'sKid Galahadsoundtrack from Follow That Dream Records. The movie only had six songs, this cd has 27 songs, so you get a lot of different versions of the same songs. The songs are all good, with ""King of the Whole Wide World"" being an all out classic. The first six songs are the mono versions from the original extended play 45. It's hard to get six songs to fit on a single, so four of the six songs were edited to be shorter. Then we get a boatload of alternate takes, which are interesting to hear how the arrangements changed over the course of the recording sessions. The cd ends with the full length stereo versions of the six master takes. Good stuff, but of course you have to be a hardcore Elvis fan to want to hear this many versions of six songs."
1,When Hell Freezes Over,"Don't bother clicking on email when this becomes available. It will be a cold day in hell before George Lucas puts this ""special"" out on DVD. He has noted on several occasions that he would pay good money to make sure every bootleg copy of this program is destroyed.I don't even think this is considered canon in the Star Wars universe."
1,This will NEVER be released by Lucas,"I saw this at age nine when it originally aired. I couldn't wait. In fact, I'd say I anticipated it even more than the TV movie ""Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park,"" which came out right around the same time and was equally execrable.Let's get this straight: this is one of the saddest, most embarrassing things ever committed to videotape. Possibly worse than Shatner singing ""Rocket Man"" at the Sci Fi awards.But, if you must see it (and you've been warned), you can certainly find it out there if you look hard enough. For a taste, though, visit: [...] You'll get the idea..."
3,A Piece of Star Wars History,"Misguided and subpar though it may have been, The Star Wars Holiday Special remains and important part of the Star Wars Universe for at least one reason, for it was here that the world got its first glimpse of Boba Fett who went on to be featured in subsequent Sequels and prequels to Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, as well as a slew of comics, novels, action figures and video games. Even if just for this one vital truth, The Holiday Special is worthy of DVD, and every fan should happily add it to their ever growing collections of Star Wars goodies, should the product ever reach shelves.May the Force be with you!"
3,The madness of King Geoge is complete if this comes to pass,"Why is it that it's easier to get the Holiday Special than the untampered SW trilogy?If you want to see the first appearence of Boba Fett then it's worth it, otherwise feel free to sit through 10 minutes of subtitle free Wookiee dialog. I'm just suprised the folks at Lucasfilm didn't splice in Mark Hamill's ""Luke, You'll be a Jedi Tonight"" dinner theater piece from the Simpsons, I would have given it an extra star and a nudge of respect.On the other hand, it does have that train-wreck kind of appeal and is a good test of intestinal fortitude. You'll find out who your true friends are if they can watch this with you without violence ensuing.Like arsenic, this can only be taken in small amounts at any given time so bring the pain.PS, Mr Lucas, if you happen to read this, if you can make Greedo shoot first then you can get rid of Mr Hamill's overindulgence of mascara. He looked like he was auditioning for Motly Crue that same day."
2,Problems of affluence,As a person who has family starving elsewhere in the world I found this book less than powerful. The writing style was what kept me reading but only so far was to be able to explain to my professor why I felt this book was less than powerful. I sure wish my aunt got the opportunities this author had but again: problems of affluence.It's a good read with a friend but just make sure that friend isn't from a third world country.
3,Format of Wasted,"I think that the format of this book should be in the form of AUDIO CD. I hope that one day that it will. It is nice that I don't have to focus my eyes to read such a good book, but I am tired of flipping the tapes, every time that i get to the end of one! Good Job Marya."
1,Ick - Zero Stars Would be More Appropriate,"This book is poorly written and rather boring. The author is very self-absobed and somewhat pathetic. I think all she really wanted to emphasis just ""how bad off"" she was/is. Was she looking for sympathy? I just wanted to shout ""grow up and get over yourself"" while I was reading this. The footnotes made the book appear to be a poorly-written thesis (I don't think she went to college - too worried about her weight.) She also contradicts herself. She claims that she's a feminist yet all she really wanted was to be the thinnest. Thinness was the only important thing to this person. It probably still is, or she wouldn't have written her memoir. She seems to want to immortalize it."
4,Enlightening account of an Eating Disordered mind,"I was recommended the book by my best friend, who herself is (was in her terms) an Anoretic. This book gives a brutally honest and often frightening account of what goes through the mind of those with eating disorders, something i can never truly understand - although i really wish i did. The story is written in such a way as to involve the reader to such an extent that you feel that you are in the room with the author watching her life unfold in a more and more disastrous manner. I feel like i've gained so much insight into my own friend, that i have so many questions for her, did she feel this, did she do that. It honestly scares me that my friend is like that and gives me all the resolve to go on with my future plan of graduating from medical school and specialising in Eating disorders. Maybe i can make a difference, but understanding is key, and this book helps give you that."
4,Honest and well-written,"Marya Hornbacher's account of her personal battle with anorexia and bulimia is a very honest look at what people with eating disorders go through. And, for anyone who has ever wanted to even experiment in bingeing, purging, or starvation, this book will let them know just exactly how unglamorous and deadly it really is."
5,This was the most poweful book I have ever encountered.,"As a teenage female growing up at the end of the millenium, I found this book so awe inspiring. The strength that it must have taken Marya Hornbacher to write this is amazing. She is so honest with her reader and she wirtes the book without preaching or imposing upon the reader. If she could only know the way this book affected me. Everyone should read Wasted."
5,I still have to find a better book on the subject.,"Well, I think I read most of the literature on the subject so that I could understand what happened to me in my early twenties when I was a functioning anorexic (I have been at a more than healthy weight for several years now, helped by quitting smoking, body building, and slowing metabolism). This comes closest of all and I still have to read a better book on the subject. I am sorry she did not write more. Her style is fantastic."
5,Great and Honest Read,"A great book. I've read it several times and that can't be said for many of the other books I've read in my life. She writes in a frank manner and her way with words is amazing. I wish I had the skill to pen my life and still be eloquent. It's a sad story of a girl with a dangerous obsession, but she doesn't write it in a way where it's so over the top. Really a great and insightful read."
4,I thought it was brilliant,"This is one of my favorite books. Depressing, I know. But Marya Hornbacher has an amazing ability to be honest. And people with eating disorders don't always recognize how they feel, and the people around them tend to not have a clue, so this book really informs the sufferer and the friend, confidante, reader, whoever, how this person is function and why they do what they do. She doesn't necessarily tell you how you feel, if you are a sufferer, but she does unabashedly look at herself and it's a liberating read in that sense. However, she is still very dark at the end of the book, and that does seem deterministic, but really, I think as hard as it is, it's also curative to see someone work so hard to get better. And work so hard even if the steps are so small. It helped realize how I felt and how it's not going to be easy, but life is worth living."
2,Pathological,"This book has the feel of someone boasting about just how bad and pathological she was. In reality, she was not recovered and was still in the grips of her eating disordered thoughts and mindset. (Significant personality pathology as well). Warning to those who are easily triggered--this book is not right for you. This book could be useful for professionals wanting to get an ""insider"" perspective of someone with severe symptoms. However, would not recommend this book for eating disordered sufferers who need to recover. This book would likely set you backwards."
2,The Eating Disorder Bible,This book makes me absolutely sick. I remember reading it in Jr. High as I was struggling with anorexia and bulimia and remember getting so many ideas from it. It basically tells you how to become the best damn anorexic/bulimic you can be. It's overly verbose with awful anologies- and not truthful- the woman was sick when she wrote it. I would never recommend this book to anyone- eating disorder or no.
2,"Been there, still there...","It never ceases to amaze me how totally and completely self-absorbed anorexics and bulimics are. Marya Hornbacher is no exception and ""Wasted"" is her own personal tribute to how dramatic and special and sick she was and still is.As a former bulimic, I was hoping to read an honest and insightful account of eating disorders, from the perspective of someone who has ""been there, done that"" and is now moving forward in recovery. Instead, Hornbacher is obviously still wallowing in her ED... ""been there, still there"".Hornbacher, in all her self-induced drama, still has not ""gotten"" recovery. She's still wrapped up in her own little epic, which doesn't include anyone but herself and her thoughts and her body. It's such a shame that she's missing out on all of the wonderful EXTERNAL things real life has to offer.I hope the readers of this book (especially the young women dabbling in ED behavior) can recognize that Hornbacher is NOT a model of what recovery looks like."
1,Dangerous Book,"As a recovered anorexic I found this book very disturbing. The books serves as a ""How To"" guide on eating disorders. Anyone with an eating disorders knows that there are certain ""Tricks of the trade"" which are very dangerous. This book spells out each of the tricks Marya used while in treatment!! This book is very dnagerous for anyone with an eating disorder. Please, I beg you, do NOT let a loved one with an eating disorder read this!"
2,Don't Be Deceived,"This book is really a ""How To"" manual from a woman who wants to capitalize on how sick she was and to some extent still is. Don't get me wrong, she is a fabulous writer, but this disease is cunning, and wily and longs to get it's accomplishments spotlighted. I would like to see Hornbacher amazing gift for the written word utilized otherwise."
4,"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall...","Length:: 2:47 MinsI give a brief overview of Wasted: Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia by Marya Hornbacher. Since I also struggled with an eating disorder for several years, I discovered elements of myself sprinkled throughout this sordid tale. This memoir tells the story of a pre-teen woman's journey through anorexia and bulimia from her near-death experiences back to the present day."
4,TRUE DETAIL CAN BE SCARY BUT SO IS THE WORLD!,MARYA DOESN'T HOLD BACK ANYTHING AS SHE SHARES HER JOURNEY THROUGH TWO EATING DISORDERS. SHE STARTS OUT AT CHILDHOOD AT THE MERE AGE OF FOUR OR FIVE LOOKING AT SUGAR CONTENT AND WORRYING ABOUT HOW SHE SHOULD BE ON A DIET. AS THE YEARS PROGRESS THE TORTURE SHE PUTS HERSELF THROUGH IS AMAZINGLY VIVID. I GIVE THIS MEMOIR FOUR STARS ONLY BECAUSE IT AT TIMES CAN BE HARD TO KEEP READING ONE TORTOUS ACT AFTER ANOTHER THAT SHE DOES TO HERSELF. THIS BOOK TAKES OUT ALL THE STOPS TO LAY THE TRUTH ON THE TABLE. AS A READER YOU WILL JOURNEY IN AND OUT OF HEALTHY TO SICK TO NEAR DEATH. THIS NOVEL IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART OR PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE EATING DISORDERS ARE VEIN AND SELF PITY TRIPS. THOUGH THE HEART ACHE MARYA TAKES YOU THROUGH A VALUABLE LESSON CAN BE LEARNED AND APPRECIATED FROM THIS BOOK I RECCAMEND IT TO ALL WANTING TO KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT TWO EATING DISORDERS WITH ANY SUGARCOATING.
2,wasted...and adrift,"I was floored by this author's talent; never have I read such an eloquent portrait of the hell of eating disorders, one I barely survived.As a survivor, though, this book infuriated me. There is no perspective, no critical eye -- her prose is brilliant, poetic, and brutal in its honesty, but it the voice of a woman drowning. I would not give this book to anyone fighting an eating disorder. It is replete with triggers, and is, at its worst, a disquietingly unchecked glamorization of self-destruction."
3,thanks!,"The book came in great conditionArrived on the last possible day which is ok but usually i get items asapit's my fave book, but had lost preivious copies so it's great to have a new copy"
3,Needs a copy editor,"The book tells a good story, but it's hard to get past all the spelling and grammar mistakes. Also, there is so much embellishment and second-person narrative that a lot of the book seems like unnecessary fluff. The writer obviously has a great vocabulary, but the copy editing mistakes made the book hard to enjoy. Luckily the story was good enough to persuade me to keep reading. It's not really her fault; she just needs a better publisher."
5,catharsis of my thoughts,"i cannot believe how relieved i felt after reading this book. i myself have anorexia and connect on so many levels with the author. the anger, the superiority complex, the fatal drive for ""just a little bit more""... I believe the point in time in which the author wrote the memoir was perfect, where she is still the cannonball firing herself into life. her mind was still in the element of anorexia which makes it all the more puncturing for your eyes to read, revealing the struggle keeps going and going. her following book, ""madness"", follows up on her life after the beginning of the illness and is also very good. this provides her later wiser point of view and her difficulties with bipolar 1."
5,I read it to scare myself,"I was told by several people that it would be a good book for me to read. I have dealt with an eating disorder since I was 10 an have been hospitalized twice. Reading this made me realize that I was no better off. I had never considered myself to be similar to others with eating disorders. This book made me realize that I am no different and that I have a problem. The book scared ma a lot. I didn't want that to happen to me again. I suggest this book for anyone who thinks that they have strange eating habits, has an eating disorder or has been told that they need to examine their eating habits."
1,"an ugly, awful book do not read","this is the most ugly awful and hate filled book I have ever read, and also major trigger. This book should not exist, as damaging ad it is. Wish I could unread it."
2,Not really worth the read,"This is not a very insighful book, - the writing is clever at times but clever does not equate to good. I can't see this being very informative or helpful to either sufferers or parents etc. there are no insights to the recovery process. There are far better books than this and I just don't think the author has really developed any crtical thinking around the nature of the eating disorder."
3,"Don't waste your money on ""Wasted""","I heard this book was supposed to be excellent, and I purchased it as soon as the paperback edition came out. Frankly, I found myself disappointed with the quality of the work and bored at times. I thought ""Wasted"" was going to be a real page turner, but there were times I just stopped reading because it was redundant, tedious, and repetitive. Maybe I couldn't relate because I've never had an eating disorder, but this book just didn't do anything for me. I'm glad I waited for the paperback edition and paid $13.00, as opposed to the $23.00 for the hardcover. If you want to read a compelling memoir of a mental illness, stick with Elizabeth Wurtzel's ""Prozac Nation"". Hornbacher's literary style is pretentious and unrealistic. She failed to stir any emotion in me other than pity for writing such a poor excuse for a novel. Sorry for the bad review, but I'm giving my honest opinion. This novel didn't quite live up to my expectations."
2,Wasted: My Time,"I don't know what it is exactly about this book that I didn't like but I thought it was awful. When I read the reviews and page excerpts I thought I would like it. I was wrong. I just got the feeling that Marya is the snobby, pretentious type and I couldn't get past that. I know what it's like to have an ED. Her writing style is terrible. I don't recommend this one to anyone who wants to read about eating disorders."
5,Everyone who is close to a women should read this book,"Everyone needs to read this book. It brings up questions other wise left empty and unasked only leading to more lost females in the Neatherworld. It is an insite into the female mind and the family pressures, social delemas, and cultural impact. It is a tail that does not claim to give answers or solve problems but shine a light on a subject eveyone should be more awair of. If you are thinking about this book stop thinking and buy it! It will change how you look at yourself in the mirror, how you look at other women, and how you look at eating disorders."
3,This is a scary book,"Hornbacher really gets under your skin. I really was getting the feeling of what an eating disorder must be like. Normally I like to snack while I read, but I just couldn't do it reading this book. Food became weird while I was reading. She also writes about anoretics strange relationship with food, strange ways of eating, and counting bites and measuring food. And then all of the ways of throwing up, and binge eating. This book is really creepy. It's amazing how she was able to keep the bulimia covered for so long. There must have been people I have known who were doing the same thing. After reading the book, I can recognize things now. And I take the whole issue much more seriously than I did. I've found I've made some sort of connection with Hornbacher. I want to know how she's doing now, and I wish there was some way I could find out what she's up to and how she is. In short this book is scary and effective. I recommend it."
1,It's not a book it's a handbook,I am a Milieu Therapist in day program for individuals with eating disorders and this book is nothing more than a handbook. I appreciate the authors honesty with dealing with her eating disorder but there is something said for being subtle.
2,recovery need not be as bleak and limited as this portrait,"Hornbacher's story is written in such a way that anyone with eating issues can find themselves within her struggle. The medical consequences that Hornbacher discribes are enough to make anyone think twice about self-destructive behavior. However, Hornbacher is hardly one to present recovery. Recovery is running for an hour a day on a treadmill then blacking out? Recovery is eating cereal for dinner sometimes on bad days? Don't sell yourself short of Hornbacher's vision of recovery with ""just being all right."" Genuine freedom from eating disorders can be possible, and Hornbacher does not accurately reflect those who have been afflicted with an eating disorder when she implies that the disease is always something you will act upon on occasion for the rest of your life."
4,Eating Disorders: True Insight,"Marya Hornbacher writes about her life's revolution around eating disorders in Wasted, a memoir of anorexia and bulimia. Throughout her life, Hornbacher faces family and health struggles as well as internal conflicts ranging from promiscuity to an addiction to crack cocaine. All of this influences her dependency on eating disorders.At times, Wasted is comparable to a girl's diary, filled with pages of poetic ramblings. The book would draw restless page skimming (which would result in equal understanding) save for Hornbacher's talent for writing with intense verbs and perfectly constructed sing-song sentences; readers roll down each page with a strong sense of imagery.Wasted is for anyone who has considered eating disorders as an option to relieve self-consciousness, or anyone interested in the psychological side of eating disorders. It's not for the light-hearted."
2,"Rather a memoir of deception, sex,drugs,and an ed........","By reading this book, I began to wonder if others not affected by eating disorders who read this book, will get the wrong idea about ""us."" I am bulimic. My issues and the majority of people that I have found have nothing to do with living a life of drugs, sex, and deception. Though I suffer with this illness, I will not be bound to menal institutes all my life. I will graduate and I will succeed. I am offended that this book was only titled what it was, where it should have included other issues. This book portrays an image of ""us"" that is very distorted."
5,wonderful book,"i love marya hornbacher's book ""wasted"", it is so easy for me to relate to and understand her battles with anorexia and bulimia. in the bad times of my eating disorder, this book has been my ""bible"" of sorts - which could be a bad thing, it is triggering if you're in a vulnerable place. but in the not-so-bad times, i've found this book to give me hope and knowledge that i'm not alone in my struggle. i think this is a great autobiography of a woman who battled anorexia and bulimia and found the strength to fight them and find recovery."
3,doesn't help people with eating disorders,"In the beginning of this book she says that she wants to help people who are suffering from eating disorders, but she doesn't even go in depth about her true recovery. People who already have eating disorders already know about what that's like, but what they may not know is how to get over it like she did. That would've made for a better story and it might've actually helped someone."
2,Overhyped and overwritten.,"I picked this book up as I was requested to do so. People have been telling me for ages that Wasted is a wonderful, mind-opening book.I will admit, that some of the information the author gives is good. Some things I wasn't aware of. However, the book was boring.Within the first few pages in the footnotes, she sets out to tell the difference between anoretic and anorexic. However, she uses the same wording in examples. This leads me to believe that she has no idea what she's talking about, or she isn't very good with words. In turn, this tells me to be cautious while reading this book.I did enjoy the book at some points, but other times it was a drag. She's a boring writer, and does too much to defend her own actions and neuroses."
4,Excellent read albeit quite triggering for most,"Marya is a fabulous writer! I am looking forward to reading her other book next. That being said, this book is very triggering for most!!!!! In fact, when i brought it with me to an inpatient ED Unit, and upon check-in, it was taken from me as ""contraband"". It triggered me on several occasions before entering the facility - but I was unable to put it down because it is such a captivating story. So, read with caution - that's all I can say. If you are newly recovered from an ED - or knee deep in its deceptive hold, don't look to this book for help. It won't help you. In fact, it'll probably set you back a few notches. This is probably best read by those whom are sympathetic to our disease, but not actually suffering from it."
5,Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia,"The book was great. It wasn't at all a phony ""inspirational"" or advice type book, and the author speaks in a refreshingly honest tone; none of the whiney ""woe is me"" you might expect. Overall an excellent book, although I will say that I was mildly put off by the ending. But I suppose that no one really picks up this book with the intention of using it to replace therapy. She's not going to ""cure"" you, or even tell you how she was ""cured"". As long as you know that before hand, it's a great read."
5,This book gave me the courage and desire to live,"Marya Hornbacher's book wasted, has actually changed my life. her harshly real words cut through me and poured salt on my wounds. Wasted is helping me get over a six year struggle with an eating disorder. The book is brilliantly written and not hokey like other eating disorder books can be. This book gave me a new attitude on life"
4,hummm I see,Well I've made it half way threw. I found it was really hard to get into this book. However one I started reading it was a little better. I find the way she writes to be a little all over the pace at some parts. It's so far an okay book we'll see once I'm done.
3,Ok Book,"This book was a good read, but I would not call it a page-turner. I brought this one to Book Club with around 10 moms and we all said the same thing."
3,"Me, myself, and I...","Though frank, harrowing, and well-written, I ultimately found this book to be tedious. Eating disorders are often characterized by extreme narcissism...this seemed to be the case for the author of this memoir. Though fascinating in it's gruesome details of her self-annihilating behavior, the book's lengthy, self-absorbed musings about the author's warped relationship with food, her problems with self image, her compulsion to expel every bite of food, etc. grew wearisome. Honestly, there was nothing new or unique about her story versus other similarly told (and equally navel-gazing) eating disorder sagas. I am fully aware of the grave nature of this disease and the struggles involved in overcoming it. But, just how ""cured"" is the anorexic whose main focus in life remains her self and her eating disorder? I wonder."
4,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","I never truly left this book until it was done. I stopped at points and it took perhaps a week to finish, but it was always on my mind. I rolled over her story in my head as I went about my days (or daze).However, it is frustrating because she switches tense and point of view as if it didn't mean anything to do so. At times when she did this (her most effective writing was in first person past), I could not stay focused and continue reading. I had to come back to it later.Also, she admonishes doctors, psychologists, etc for making broad generilizations and yet makes many of her own.Do not let these things stop you from reading it though. In the end you come out on top."
4,Powerful words on a powerful subject.,"The story of a young girl obsessed with her weight. Psychiatrists label it ""anorexia nervosa"", but what it really is is an endless cycle of eating, starving, binging, purging, until death. The book explores the results this bizarre behavior has on this one girl, and how it destroys what could have been a beautiful life. A horrible disease wastes this girl until nothing is left but a bone. I would have liked to have seen Marya Hornbacher go into the psychology and background of her illness more, and this lack of input causes the book to be a tad incomplete. Still, it is moving and powerful, one girl's account of a horrible illness plaguing the world today. You will not be sorry you read it."
5,A must read for all women,"This is easily the most amazing book I have ever read. It has been over two years since I first read WASTED and it still touches my soul. I have very few thing in common with Marya (in terms of upbringing, likes / dislikes, etc) yet somehow she manages to put my thoughts into words. This is a must read for all women. The author is an exceptional writer. She even cites reference to clinical terms and descriptions to support all of her theories and statements. I cannot express how much this story has meant to me. Read it, you won't be sorry."
5,she knows how we feel,"as someone who has suffered on and off from eating disorders for the last ten years, I can really relate to what Marya writes. She is also very adept at capturing emotions of anorectics, and letting people know that you can be at a normal weight, and yet still battling the demons in your head. a refreshingly honest book"
4,Reality. Disease. Romance,"I think Mayra did a wonderful job in bringing ou her story in the most effective way possible. The writing was surprisingly witty and the plot well-constructed. However, the only downfall is that I still find this to be a bit romantacized about Anorexia in the same was Requiem for a Dream romantacized drugs. While the main point is about the dangers, there still builds a sense of romance and intrigue about this ""otherworld"" as she likes to call it."
5,painfully honest and frightening,"The seriousness of the subject matter and the author's intensity with which she expresses herself is sometimes overwhelming. I felt like skipping some of her hospital antics and experiences to find the ""happily ever after"" ending. It's amazing she is so articulate, introspective and knowledgeable. Thankfully she has written about her illness in a way that might actually scare others on the same path."
5,One of THE Best Memoirs I Have Read,"Marya Hornbacher gives a very candid account of what her life was like growing up with bulimia. Having been a sufferer myself, I found this book relateable. I gave copies to my parents because so much of what she experienced, I went through. I found it helpful. I couldn't put it down!"
5,Extremely helpful,"As a college student recovering from anorexia I always felt alone and that no one in the world understood what I was going through. That is, until I bought this book. Hornbacher writes with such genuine, thought-provoking and touching words...that I now feel like this is a disease that I can keep overcoming. That there are people out there that have overcome the odds and beat this horrible thing. Hornbacher's easy to read narrative provides deep insight into the disease and hope for recovery."
3,Borrow it from the library,"My feeling about this book is neutral - sometimes it was hard to put down and other times I had to skip paragraphs because it was dragging. Although her story is an interesting and well written one, the endless footnotes and numerous digressions about how inconsiderate and/or insensitive someone in her life was, etc. are a bit distracting. Definitely a good book for someone doing research because she includes a long list of references in the back of the book. Note: Do not expect a book that glamorizes eating disorders because this DEFINITELY does not."
4,Insightful!,"In WASTED Marya Hornbacher invites the reader to see the thoughts and feelings behind her personal struggle with eating disorders. This book shows her deep, intense, and personal insight of what she had to deal with ""growing up"". I believe the book is, at least, magnificant work. Afterall it is her story! She does not hind the facts or oversimplify the reality of a life with an eating disorder. What she reveals is shocking and at some times grotesque. I did not want to put the book down, but there were times I just had to take a break. Her detail exhausted me! I feel it is impossible to grasp all the book has to offer only reading it once. I plan to read it again soon."
5,Great for the mind!,"I've been trading for years now. This book opened my eyes! The authors reveal the biggest psychological pitfalls many traders fall into, and I was falling into all of them! Now, I am much more confident and just that much more successful as a trader. Thanks so much Greg!!"
1,sheep in wolves clothing,"The book is very entertaining, and seemingly well written, it is pointed at the idea of being truly and sincerely interested in the customer. However, I cannot allow innocent individuals to be trapped by this authors seeming innocence. There have been over 72,000 subscribers to their services, and very few remain, including myself. This organization thrives on the case that you can't prove me wrong, you can't prove me right. A fool will tend to part with his money, often by trusting the hidden huckster that thinks he can hide behind ""what you don't know"". I also suggest that before one does business with this firm that a thorough background check be done on Mr. Velez & Capra. Velez mentioned that he was evicted 27 times...I understand that he is 31 years old...You can start there...Once a huckster, always a huckster..."
5,Just Perfect,This book is really the one. Now I fell more confident when I strike the market. No more words than JUST PERFECT. I do recommend this book.
2,Hype,"Best described as a new generation, cross between Farley's Master Swing Trader and Jea Yu's Undergroundtrader book. Begins with some solid psychological points, that leads into subpar chapters of rules and cliches, and then ends with even worse trading techniques and methods. These are very basic, very well known and essentially useless trading methods that any respectable trader should already have seen. Ideally targeted for beginners and filled with hype for various .com webpages and their own Pristine trading service. The only real good thing I could say is that it is quick and easy to read, despite being an very large book."
5,A great book,"Thanks gawd I didn't trust those 1 star review and bought the book anyway since the index of the book was available on a different site. I have read over 20 books so far and this is one of the best book on trading ever. Yes there is some hype on the pristine service (and some other web site) but far beyound, a great advice from a man who has been there and done that. This book includes some advice (and wisdom) not found anywhere else. If you are serious about becoming a master daytrader, go beyond the noise and the smoke and get to the real thing. Do not enter a single trade before the completion of this book. Very well done Mr. Velez and Capra."
1,I can't believe how gullible readers are!,"I saw the promos on the pristine service and couldn't wait to purchase the book. Not only did I buy the book, subsequently I attended a seminar with the authors. The book left me cold and I found no value wharsoever in the concept? or techniques? presented--nothing original, unique, or worthwhile. I felt that I must have overlooked something. The seminar ratified what I concluded after reading the book, ""this fish smells."" The spokesman Velez talked slick, dressed slick, and was slick down to his pin-stripe moustache. His partner Capra was noticeably silent and I realized quickly why. Whereas Valez was vaguely familiar with the workings of the market, Capra had no prior experience. It's amazing how little they both knew. It appears that these two rascals have done one thing successfully and that's duping the unitiated and hungry wannabe trader. After reading the book, I wanted to take a shower and after hearing Valez speak, I wanted to take a bath!!!!!"
1,"Professional Traders, probably: Amateur Writers, definitely!","To be fair I am less than half way through and can make no judgment yet on the trading systems and tactics they offer. But if these guys are now so well-off from their mastery of trading, why could they not afford a decent editor for this tome. I honestly have never read more poorly put together prose. Misuse and misspelling of words, so much redundancy that they must think the reader is dumb or has zero attention span, supercilious quotes sometimes repeated accidentally in neighboring paragraphs, and a really really low density of information. If I had wanted a tongue lashing combined with a sophomoric pep talk delivered from an arrogant role model, I'd by a Rambo tape. I have no axe to grind and have not lost money using their services. I will read this drivel to the end. For now it seems that a one page list of dos and don'ts with instructions to copy it over 100 times until it sinks in would replace what I've read so far."
1,Interesting,"I purchased this book becuase of the disparity in the online reviews. Either fives stars or one star. Being a profesional trader for over 15 years, I am always intersted in learning new techniques. Nothing new or interesting here. Just basic information that is avaialbe anywehre. The 200 Period moving average has been around froever, how they call it the Pristine 200 Period MA is amazing to me.Having written serveral trading systems myself, I always backtest what I write before using real money. This tells me whether or not it will be succesful. Why havent any of their techniques been back tested? Maybe becaue they don't work. I am so disspointed that I spent so much money for so little information. He (Oliver) is a master salesman. He should have a Dale Carnegie type seminar instead of a Pristine Traidng seminar, it would provide more value.Save your money."
1,"Strong in hype, feable in substance","If one enjoys reading fiction and listening to sales pitch, this is the right book to own. Nearly every topic discussed in the book has been discussed else where with far greater lucidity and fluency. In addition, Pristine enjoys a very dubious in the legitimate trading community - 2 of my current students nearly lost their entire trading accounts following it. With Toni Turner's book, a much more honest and worthwhile book selling at 1/4th the cost, I just don't see any merit in paying $55 for Mr. Velez and Capra's sales presentations."
1,Tools and Tactics for the master day trader,"I ordered this book before it was printed, and I had read many day trading books before. This one is not that good, mostly the authors are bragging about themselves. There is not much to learn from a book like this."
2,Authors style is difficult to take,"The first half fo this book is unendingly painful to read because of the authors condescending style, shameless promotion of his trading seminars and trading center and ""we are the best thing since sliced bread"" attitute. Thankfully, this eventually exhausts itself and the second half actually has a few good tidbits for beginning traders."
1,Evidence is golden,"Hollywood is everpresent...particularly on Wall Street with major firms...and particularly this book...investors should do a little due dilligence and use common sense...if you go to the author's website www.pristine.com and check out the performance...the results are worse than the flip of a coin...although the book is well written...it means nothing unless the authors can prove themselves like any other mutual or hedge fund has to do in terms of their performance...these people are simply selling into greed and the ignorance of those who simply do not know better. I am sure that market makers could care less about checking a chart pattern before they make a move.and furthermore, a monkey is not showing any brilliance when the dart he threw at the stock pages hit a stock that went up that day..it could have just as easily been a chart association. Hollywood once more guys..nothing of real substance..."
1,New York Cowchips?,"I have been trading for years very successfully and often find it quite amusing to read books that are about trading. Off the top, I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but I just have to believe that since there is absolutely no hard evidence that any of these techniques really work...they must not....there is not even any backtesting test results which is also not not even respected in the industry...Just show me the real statements of the authors as evidence that's all...and I would pay big money for all of their services in a New York minute....I am going to use this book in the next local cowchip throwing contest....just goes to show that there are also cowchips in New York...."
2,Moving Right Along,"The book is very interesting with regards to common usage of moving averages and candlestick chart patterns. I have studied many trading systems over the years beginning with the futures market. Whereas I totally respect the difficulty of publishing books, I am still waiting for a credible track record or some third party proof that the system really does work. There are no such representations in the book which makes it difficult for me to give the authors any serious consideration. It is also somewhat disturbing to find that the author was evicted so many times in a very short period of time. To me there is a clear lacking of basic truths as there is commonly found on Wall Street. I guess I will be moving right along to hopefully find authors that truly have credibility."
1,Avoid this book at all costs,"Fortunately I only paid a few pound for this book at a book fair. I have been successfully day trading for over 5 years, have read in excess of 60 books. This is the worst I have seen. Oliver Velez should be taking out the backyard and horse whipped."
1,Who's Fooling Who,"I lost a great deal of money following these people's services....When I looked at their website, I thought that Velez's July 14th caption on their website was hilarious...The Quote of the Day For - July 14, 2000Online Trading Expo interviews Oliver Velez ...We focus on education in addition to pulling money out of the markets. It's one thing to follow a guru or follow a newsletter and make money off of someone else's ideas. It's another thing to learn what the proper tools are and to acquire the proper knowledge so that one day you don't need to rely on gurus. Our services, newsletters and seminars are designed to build independence...Somebody or agency needs to call their bluff....After looking at Velez's picture, I feel like my car is being stolen....This kind of organization should not be allowed to operate."
4,Great book.,"I agree with some of the other reviewers comments regarding the first 5 chapters of this book. Those chapters are certainly the Holy Grail of trading, not the few techniques introduced later which are helpful no doubt but certainly not the win-all, which if you read the first 5 chapters you will know that doesn't exist.I found that this book was well complemented by David Nassar's two books and home study course, (How to Get Started with Electronic Day Trading and Rules of the Trade).I would highly recommend this book to anyone who day trades, swing trades for part time or full time, but please do not make the mistake that other reviewers have made and think that this book is the only book you will need to read to be successful! It just doesn't work that way! Happy hunting!"
1,Performance verification,The book is more centered on entertainment than trading. There is no concrete way of verifying that the supposedly sound methods even work. I find it hard to believe that someone can get evicted so many times...Nothing wrong with entertainment...but I certainly would not bet my money on this unfounded methodology. I think the author would make a good fiction writer.
1,Wade Cook the Second,"Unfortunately, I am one of those American suckers who ate every little bit of pie Mr. Velez was feeding the crowd...I find his talk very slick and persuasive...however the performance cost me over $150,000...Thanks to Mr. Capra & Velez...it will be a long time before I retire...someone ought to retire them....such as the NASD or the SEC...."
1,Incredible,"Incredible how this book focuses on selling services rather than how to trade. I feel as if I'm an incomplete, un-educated trader after reading this book. The author would have you believe that a successful trading career is futile without subscribing to Pristine's services. There some valid points and interesting facts, but not enough substance. There are several successful trading methods in existance, this book makes if sound as if there is only one. All in all, an ok book if you know absolutely nothing about trading, far to meanial for anyone with any type of experience. If more attention was focus on trading and not selling, it would probably be a decent book"
1,None so blind as those who can see.,"Everything I wanted to say about this book has already been said here - ad nauseum - but somehow, people still don't get it.Read the reviews here. Look at the number of people who found the 'glowing' reviews useful and then see how many DIDN'T find the truth about this book and its author(s) useful.Ever wonder why so many lose trading? It's all right here within these review pages.Some people just want to see and hear what they want even when the truth is staring them in the face.The author(s) state that 'Master' traders find the 'greater fool' and then sell to him/her.The condescending prose of this book reveal that these guys have now graduated. They now know where the 'greatest number' of 'greater fools' are and have moved beyond the securities markets.They are 'Masters'.Who then, do you think the greater fools might be?"
3,Tools and Tactics for the master daytrader,"This book is very well written and is full of good information, but I feel as if I am being taken in again by the ""Pristine PR Machine"". I hear Mr Valez touting that his personal portfolio is up over 700%, yet his daily newsletter throws out pick after pick, then they tout the one or two winners, ignoring the 99% that lose.I hear Mr Valez talk about Rags to Riches in his struggle to the top, and being evicted 27 (thats twenty seven) times in his youth while trading. These are all great stories, and good on him for overcomming struggles, but I keep asking myself why should I follow someone who has bilked 27 homeowners out of hard earned cash. As a homeowner I dont take this lightly.Am I being taken again with this book I keep asking myself? Is this another ""Wade Cook"" PR machine? Between the Newsletter track and evictions I think I will push the ""pass"" button. Take the information for what it is worth, but dont chase the hype."
1,WALL STREET HUMOR,"Recently I had the opportunity to munexpectantly meet the author Velez and his staff including Capra at the Online Tradeshow after I had read their book. I am a second generation marketmaker and am very successful at daytrading. I must say that these people can sell to novice wannabe traders but would never be able to stand the rigour of Wall Street. Anyone on Wall Street would laugh at the claims of these authors particularly with regard to pattern recognition. This simply does not work. Furthermore, these individuals claim they have in depth knowledge about how to protect their traders interests from those of market makers, but they gave me wrong and ignorant answers to me at the show. Its just unfortunate for those ignorant wannabes that would buy any services from these bogous amateurs."
3,Investing 4 dummies! :-D,Very informative for someone trying to enter the world of investing. Reading this along with a few of Robert T. Kiyosaki. Should teach about finacing in the schools. Give kids a jump start on making $$$$.
2,ALook at the master DayTrader,"The book is all about psychology of traders not really any math tools to help me.But, to be fair, I have worked thirteen years on math functions for the market, and they work well.So I was looking for somthing better than my works.It just seems like the tools the trade brokers offer are almost worthless.A book with graphs and functions is where I am, since buy and hold is out.And peoples moods are changing all the time, and trying to forcast moods, not for me.Thanks anyway to the writer."
1,A Documentary Of The Largest Scam in The Daytrading Arena,"1 Star was the lowest rating I could find, if ""SCAM"" was na option I would have selected it. This book will soon serve as ""exhibit A"" in the case against these highway thieves. Do your homework first. Look at this post before you spend anything on this book[...]Proceed with caution!"
5,a self-nurturing companion,Coming Home to Ourselves is a self nurturing companion and a heart-felt support system that will help you continue to heal.
5,A Reawakening,"For thousands of years, woman has been the primary caregiver, not only to her children but to everyone in her world as wife, daughter, sister, neighbor and friend. We were taught to suppress our own needs in order to have more to give to others. In Coming Home to Ourselves, we discover that in fact the opposite is true. When we give from a place of emptiness we just become more empty. We must first create and maintain a reservoir of love and life energy from which to draw. Then we can give to others with joy and love, from a place of abundance. Jan Forrest shows us that by making small changes in our daily lives we can find the time to reawaken the spirit of joy within by giving ourselves the gift of ourselves."
1,advantage doesn't work in FL,"we have used Advantage for over ten years. In Jax, FL it no longer works. days after treatment we see fleas on our dogs and cats and flea eggs in house. This has been happening consistently for the past year. I would not recommend advantage, use Frontline for dogs or frontline for cats instead. Advantage is a waste of time and money if you live in Jax, FL where the fleas are resistant and immune to its effects."
4,"Will protect your pans, silicon could use a little better grip","These tongs are definitely sturdy, and the silicon coating will help protect your pans. I've used these for a couple weeks and the only drawback is that the silicon can sometimes be too slick to really grab onto food. It's more of a problem when the food is in water (like pasta).However, they're infinitely better than the all-plastic variety of tongs. With the plastic kind, you can't get a grip on anything because the plastic just bends. The metal tongs allow you to squeeze strongly enough to pick something up.Bottom line: Nice to have in the kitchen, but not the only pair of tongs you'll ever need."
3,Spring too weak,The spring does not provide adequate open pressure. The rest of the product is of nice quality. It is unfortunate about the spring because it makes using the tongs somewhat cumbersome.
3,why'd I buy it?,"I'm not sure why I needed silicone tongs? I never reach for them during my cooking. I always reach for the Rosle (sp?) locking tongs though so maybe thats why, cause the Rosles are awesome."
1,Definitely Not Dory's Best Work,"If you're not familiar with Dory Previn's story, she is well worth a Google or a quick scan on You Tube. If you want to give her a spin, I recommend ""On My Way to Where"" as a musical and accessible entry point into her work. On the other hand, ""Mary C. Brown and the Hollywood Sign"" seems to map sonic territory that is probably best left unexplored. This is a strident-sounding LP powered by an incompetent mix that does nothing to grace Dory's naturally-thin voice. I doubt that the increased sonic resolution of a CD would improve the situation. That's bad enough. Worse, the psychologically-loaded word play that makes some of her other albums so charming seems to coagulate into a pretentiously-introspective dirge on ""Mary C. Brown and the Hollywood Sign"". Buyer beware."
5,Cute Cat Mug,"I bought this mug because I love cats; we have three, so cat hair is going to happen:)We also have a black cat, like the ones on the mug. It's a nice big mug, and my kids love it and fight over who gets to use it!"
1,Outrageous shipping costs!,"$10 for shipping and handling for one jar of salsa is absolutely ridiculous. I understand that glass jars are heavy, but this is quite a mark-up."
2,Unworthy of the first Bourne novel,"I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it. Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to ""save"" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable. Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression? It truly seems like another writer. This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity."
1,Saw the Movie First,"Read about 100 pages and understand completely why the writers of the movies wanted no parts of this book. Currently I am on page 500. This book is better than Ambien and Lunesta combined.I agree with some of the other comments here, I seriously doubt he wrote this one having read some of his earlier work.Please 1 cent is not worth it unless they paid you to ship it out of their warehouse.OK so it took me 3 weeks to finish the last 109 pages. This book is about 509 pages too long. You know the end by page 5 and this convoluted novel is so one dimensional I am surprised that it resides in our dimension. GOD AWFUL."
2,Only slightly entertaining,"This book is a disappointment. I enjoyed the first two books, the first being the best and the second alittle less, but wow does this one bite.The plot is very very poor, once again Carlos is after Bourne only this time it really is Carlos. It is just not well written the plot is too thin and the characters are stale.I had a hard time putting down the first two books and now I am having a hard time finishing this one. About two chapters left and I am free!!"
3,Bourne For Showdown!,"The final book in the famous Bourne trilogy is an explosive romp through the twists and thrills that characterize any Ludlum novel.As unlikely as it sounds, shady assassin Carlos The Jackal is seeking a final showdown with Bourne and makes it clear by tracking and involving Bourne's (a.k.a. David Webb) associates and family. Forced to defend his wife and children, the chameleon Bourne takes on the challenge, which leads to bizarre and far-fetched plot twists which take place in the United States, Caribbean, France, Belgium and the USSR.It is a savage thrill ride that is only marred by the inexplicable and irrational actions and mishaps of the adversaries and their foes and associates. Fasten your seatbelts and make sure the backup ammunition is close by!"
2,Doesn't live up Identity and Supremacy,"The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy are two of my favorite novels. I have probably read each of them four or five times. I'd just as soon forget about Ultimatum, it doesn't have the hard core, kick butt Jason Bourne that we want to read about and it's a limp way for a story about a hero like Bourne to end. Go ahead and read it if you like Bourne, like I did, but it's definitely not in the same class as the first two. Bourne has lost his steam and edge and is just... can I say it? A fumbling broken old guy."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO BOURNE BOOKS,"But still a must read in order to close out the triology. Delta vs the Jackal - The final showdown. Jason Bourne is now getting old and it shows. He has lost a few steps and the dying Carlos is still the better assassin. I would have liked a better ending, like seeing Jason take out Carlos mano a mano. Some of the action seemed to blurr together for me. Perhaps I have just read too much of this stuff lately?? Check out my about you page and email me any good thriller suggestions!"
1,One star is generous,I read my first Ludlum novels back in high school and the memory of those books fooled me into getting trying this one out. Despite having fairly moderate expectations (I just wanted some easy summer reading) the writing is so awkward - never mind the ridiculous 'dialog' - that I felt embarrassed for the author for writing it and for myself for having spent money on buying this waste of trees. I am not a book snob but there has to be a bare minimum of competency when it comes to being a bestselling author. The Bourne Ultimatum reads like it was written by a high school student for a middle-school audience. I have tried about a dozen times to read this thing but I start to giggle each time a character talks or each time there's some sort of plot exposition (and there's a lot of this). Character development? What's that?I do have one thing to be thankful for and that is I will avoid bestseller's lists and authors.Great read? Seriously? In what Bizarro World do you live in?
2,"Too Long, Too Repetitive, Too Much...","This is a sorry conclusion to the Bourne series. The character of Jason Bourne, as established in The Bourne Identity was absent from this book. In his place, what we find is a man who not only suffers from old age, but a significant loss of intelligence. He stumbles through the whole book, reacting emotionally, complaining, and being outsmarted by everyone he comes in contact with. The final showdown with Carlos the Jackal is another disappointment, with a young kid being the final hero, because ""Jason"" was too injured, too dejected, too shortsited, and too old to finally to the job himself.I was truly disappointed in this book and don't understand why it continually gets good reviews."
1,very huge disappointment for fan of the films,"From the very first page of this book, I knew there was trouble.Instead of making me want to delve in, the first page teaser confused me, and it was badly written.I was extremely hopeful and forgiving as I forced myself to read more and more of this book.It seemed more stupid and silly and bad as I read more and more of it.In desperation, I turned to the Amazon reviews to see if I was missing something that I could correct and then go back to read the book and enjoy it.The bad reviews only re-inforced what I already sensed.There was no saving this jumbled, badly written, uninteresting story.The movies must be totally re-written by a good writer who understands how to tell a story"
3,"It's okay, I guess...","It's a bit predictable! And yes, I have to agree with many of the reviewers here that the author made the novel intentionally long. You get really tired of it after 300 or 400 pages because you know the REAL good part is the last 50 pages... The ones before that about Jason Bourne vs The Jackal is too predictable; you know what's gonna happen. It's not as good as The Bourne Identity. Ludlum should've made Bourne kill Carlos in that one instead!!But, not the entire story is bad, some are smart and interesting and cool, so I will give it 3 stars. It was worth reading, but not a book I would pick up if I knew how it goes."
4,library binding,I have never ordered a book before that had library binding. I will not order with that type of binding again. It is not at all like a hardcover binding. The book itself is a great Robert Ludlum read.
2,Please read to yourself,"This is my first Robert Ludlum book so I am not familiar with his writing style. I like the Bourne movies but this plot does not have anything to do with the movie and, quite frankly, does not seem very intelligent or exciting. But the WORST part of this recording is in the reading performance. Even a mediocre book could be illuminated by a good reader. Who is this Darren McGavin? Most of the time he reads in a very bored manner, taking a big breath and then reading through the passages as fast and monotone as he can go making it difficult to follow what's going on. Then if he finds something he thinks is interesting, he slows down a little to mumble through the character parts. How can you tell anyone apart? All the characters are mumbling, disinterested, foreign, coughing old men."
4,Good for what you would expect,"Rogue CIA and KGB agents, global military-industrial conspiracy to control the global economy, massive bloodletting, damsels in distress. You were expecting something else from Robert Ludlum? If you know what to expect you will have a great time reading this book. Proponents will enjoy how all the elements are tied together. Critics will point out that all the extraneous elements should have never been introduced together in one story line. If you are looking for a carefree book that while dealing with serious subject matter as a story line has a carnival atmosphere to it, you will enjoy this book."
1,Shameful,"This is a shameful attempt at literature. I've never understood the obsession with Robert Ludlum. I find him to be insanely over descriptive and nausiatingly over-dramatic. I did enjoy The Ambler Warning and The Bourne Identity, but this is just awful. The dialougue is pitiful and unnatural. The movies are better on every imaginable level."
3,About 200 pages too long,"I'm a fan of the Bourne series and character, but this book definitely isn't the best of the bunch. There's a lot of good. Unfortunately, though, the author drew this one out too much. I can honestly say that for about the last third of the book I was ready for it to end and had to more or less force myself to finish."
1,Couldn't be written by Ludlum,"I agree with another reviewer here who said that they couldn't believe that this final Bourne book was written by Ludlum. I had to read the prologue twice, trying to understand what the heck it was saying. I only read the first page, and I wonder if it had been translated from Chinese or some other non-English language by one of those automatic translator programs. I could only make it through the first page. I am going to give the book away. I don't have time to waste, and I am not a masochist. I have a copy of The Tailor of Panama and will read that instead. Don't waste your time. Pick up something by John Le Carre instead."
2,Worst of the Trilogy,"Okay, the movies are entirely different from the books. The first book rocked. The second was pretty good. ""Ultimatum"" is a overwritten waste of time. Bourne makes some pretty stupid mistakes, the plot twists fall on the side of unbelievable, and the dialogue is awful. This hardly seems like the same author."
1,Too much of a good thing,"The first two (Identity, Legacy) are beautiful page-turners. However, in the third installment, the Jason Bourne vs. David Webb struggle becomes a dead horse. You can only carry that split so far in a plot line before the man either must end up in an insane asylum, or integrate the pieces and move on. While a desparately wanted the saga to continue, I would rather not have seen it end with this book."
2,Almost one too many.,"The third book of the Bourne trilogy just does not stand up to ""The Bourne Identity."" He lost his character! He never comes close to bringing Jason to life, and making him real,and yet,larger than life, like he was in ""The Bourne Identity."" This book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it. I get the same feeling from Tom Clancy's later works; they do not ring of the author's metal There are so many mistakes in this work,and it is so cluttered-up with half explanations, and under developed situations and characters,that it would hardly rate a C- in any college creative writing class.I was very hard-pressed to complete the read,very sorry to say. It is about twice the length it should be,given all the flaws,requiring the reader to really work hard to finish."
4,And so the great ones aged...,"Although the plot obsessed on the Jackal-Bourne confrontation, the two had little exposure towards each other for the most part of the story. And what little face-to-face combat they had had to be made as realistic as possible, as it would seem preposterous to see 2 aging assassins shooting each other to no end. Although the turn of events were too convenient for our protagonist, and in reality, his killing skills were no match for the Jackal (as Bourne supposedly had conscience), it was nonetheless exciting to witness every nuances, twists, developments and success in Jason Bourne/David Webb's life."
1,the bourne ultimatum,one of the worst books i have ever read. not near as good as the bourne identity. bourne should have killed carlos in the first book and saved us from the bourne ultimatum.
3,Lunacy!,"well, i finally finished the bourne ultimatum, it took me around three years to finish it! i'd read a little, get drowsy or frustrated, put it down for a few weeks or months, while i read other books, as of now, i've finished the original trilogy, yay! back to the book, it was very long, confusing, and really difficult to follow, for me, anyway. i think the medusa subplot would have made for a pretty good stand alone novel, in fact, i enjoyed it more than the jason bourne plot, i would have loved to read a book with conklin and panov as the main characters, i never could warm up to jason and marie, bottom line, read it if you're compelled to finish the series, like i was, but be prepared for a long, hard, slog."
2,"bad book, great movie","In short the movie was much more interesting and suspensful then the book. The book was very confusing, boring and implausable. Skip the book, see the movie."
3,Good story,I had read the other Bourne books before they were made into movies and really enjoyed them. I was not as impressed with this as I was with the others. This story is good I just did not like how everything was brought out. If you are a Ludlum fan I would for sure give it a go just don't forget it took place in a different place and time than the movies.
1,very disapointing,"This adapter had less than a 4mm hole for them motor shaft to go into. this was checked in comparison to other adapters, and this one is wrong. the weight also doesnt feel right. it feels cheap and flimsy, find another 4mm size!"
5,Can you say ¡excelente! ?,Even if you don't know Spanish you will become instantly addicted to the lyrical sounds of the music of Inti-Illimani. It is enchanting! And if you do understand Spanish you will be deeply moved by the lyrics. The music is even more powerful to those who have lived in or visited Chile.
4,beautiful music,"This is a brilliant album - Inti-Illimani, John WIlliams, Paco Peña? C'mon! This is music that will reward patient listeners. This is deeply soulful, social protest music. Non-Spanish speakers should try to track down the lyrics and find a way of translating them, to appreciate the meaning and the sentiment.As for the reviewer who copies and pastes the same review for all his reviews of Inti-Illimani's discs... ""...the use of this review section as a political venue to praise Allende..."" - I don't think one line in a review makes it a political venue, but you have just made it into one with your few paragraphs praising Pinochet."
5,Word of Mouth is where Cohn's at,Terrific album. I traveled cross country & back with EJJ in the box & was just blown away.
4,A good book for studying Scandinavia Royalty,"This is a good book, particularly if you are just starting to study mordern day Scandinavia royalty as I am. Though I do wish the author could have included a bit more description on how the Bernadotte Dynasty was founded in Sweden and how the descendents of Carl Johan and Desiree continue to make their family popular and a sucess in Sweden today."
2,Interesting but not great,"The title may be catchy but don't expect to get a book on modern day kings like Arthur. My humanities teacher assigned this book and our first impression was something along the lines of a movie but it really wasn't. This book is just about the people and influences that make a big influence in modern day Scandanavia. I am not saying that this book was stupid and horrible because it wasn't. If you're looking for something whimsical and romantic, then keep browsing."
5,Fantastic Product,"I bought this product for my Theatre Production class. It is absolutely awesome! It looks tool. It works wonderfully. The carabineer is a bit big... but it still works great. If you are looking for a tool lanyard, look no further!"
1,couldn't even finish it,Ive read hundreds and hundreds of mysteries and read all the previous books by this author and this is the worst book I have ever read. Ive read 3 chapters and I cant read anymore. Its boring and rambles and has no flow. Ive grown to hate goldy and shes not even a real person. I'm done with the series!
4,Good read.,I have always liked her books. Good bedtime reading. Although the recipes are too fancy for me. Mostly always a happy ending.
4,"Book good, Kindle editon blech!","This is a fine addition to the series, but buy the printed version. The editing in the Kindle edition is terrible. The friend's name is MARLA, not Maria. I complained about this in the last book, but they NEVER got it right in this one. There were other annoying errors too. No more Kindle editions of this author for me, so I'm probably done reading this author."
2,Not For Me,A caterer with problems married to a policeman with problems at work and a dead body or two. Not my cup of tea.
4,Prime mystery,"How many times have I read this book? Three? Four? Five??? In any case, it never fails to enthrall me.Davidson does such an excellent job of pulling the reader into the world of Aspen Meadows and Goldy Schultz. I read the books as much for the characters as for the mystery, and I'm never disappointed. This volume has a strong plot and great characterization.Vintage Davidson. Don't miss it."
3,Promising,"This was my first read of any part of this series. I found the main characters warm and engaging and this alone will ensure that I locate and read the rest of this series.The plotting however was loose and confusing and the motivation of the ""bad guys"" equally unclear. Nevertheless, it was an interesting and fun read."
3,A Comfortable Read,"It was good to revisit Goldy, her friends, and family in Aspen Meadow. Davidson's characters, as always, spring effortlessly to life. The plot line was interesting, if somewhat lightweight. But sometimes that just hits the spot, whereas a deep dark mystery would be too depressing. Some reviewers here have expressed dismay, saying Goldy's son betrayed her. That wasn't my take. Arch was tricked into revealing information concerning his mom. I think Davidson has captured the mindset of a fourteen year old boy perfectly. Goldy often says that she finds comfort in food prep. I find comfort in reading about it. And the recipes! Yum."
1,Leaves a bad taste in my mouth!,"I really enjoyed the other books in this series but this one was a big disappointment. I kept asking myself why I was reading this book as it was BORING! The story was very convoluted, disjointed and hard to follow and not at all probable. She is talking about one issue and then throws in some ramblings of being a member of the Board of Theological Examiners for the local Episcopal Diocese. If she wants to tout her Episcopal affiliation that's fine (I'm an Episcopalian too) but let it have some relavence to the story! That her son, a 14 yr.old would know some navaho and all about encryption is very far fetched-let Arch go out and play! This one had none of the charm of the early works. Her husband calling her Ms. G every time I blinked was getting very old. All in all save your money, but if you feel compelled to waste it buy the paperback."
1,extremely depressing,"If you enjoy reading a book where everything turns out bad, you'll like this one! Personally I do not care for this type of scenario. There needs to be a few things to feel good about. The motivation of the competitive caterer was fairly obvious from the get-go. The 14 year-old son is extremely tiresome most of the time. He needs to know the awful truth about his jail-bird father. Why in the world doesn't Goldy level with him? No respect garnered for her on that one! This is so not true-to-life! I had a hard time finding the motivation to finish this one."
2,No focus on the murder,This is the first book I read by Diane Mott Davidson. I was disappointed. The victim was murdered to early in the book. The author didn't build the charaters before the murder happened. The story line had too many other things going on besides focusing in on the murderer. I even considered not finishing the book. The last few chapters were good when everything started coming together. I would not read another book by Diane Mott Davidson.
4,Not-So-Prime Cut,"I love the Goldie the caterer series - this one just doesn't ""measure up."" The usual character development just isn't here - I kept thinking - who are the women - who is which? If you must choose, skip this one and go on to ""Tough Cookie."""
3,"Good road trip story, but a couple of annoying characters...","This is the second DMD book that I've listened to on road-trips. They make very pleasant companions!And I will certainly take her newest one with me on my next trip. HOWEVER....I don't understand Goldie's son Arch. First he seems very immature for a boy of fourteen. Second, I was absolutely amazed by Arch's betrayal of his mother, is Arch morally vacuus, or simpleminded? Surely at his age and having lived with his mother, he is aware of the abuse and ill-will that the JRK carrys. I also could care less for the JRK. As a character I think he adds nothing, except to make me wonder why Goldie can't get him out of her life. On a positive note......please give us more MARLA! She's my favorite character, fun, smart, and sassy!"
3,Prime Cut,"I waited soooooo long for this to come out in paper, and was soooooo disappointed! I've read all of DMD's books, and loved them, but this one was hard to follow, and a bit contrived. Ms G needs a bit more backbone in handling both her hubby, and her son. I missed Marla, and was glad to have Julian back, but just found the plot-line hard to take. I'm cetainly not stupid, but the explanation of the code and code-breaking had my head swimming! I'll read the next one, as a matter of fact, i can't wait for it, but this was not my fav!"
3,Get a glimpse into the tumultuous times of the 60s,"For historical purposes this film rates as a classic. Typical of a late 60s rock show, though, we have Keith's guitar terribly out of tunes at times; especially on ""Satisfaction."" These documents stand as more than just a record of a concert, they give us a small glimpse back at the culture of the late 60s. Very nice dress Mick!"
3,Stones at Hyde Park,"Here it is, on DVD: The legendary Stones concert at Hyde Park, 1969. Only days after original member Brian Jones was found dead in his swimming pool. This was supposed to introduce Mick Taylor to the world but instead became a tribute to Jones. I had actually found this concert on video many, many years before and it was awful then. Truth be told, the concert itself is awful. And I love the Stones! It's incredible that only a few short months later, they began their '69 US tour and were fantastic. It's fun to watch this and realize that this was 40yrs ago. If you're a Stones fan, you simply have to have this DVD, for your collection. You may watch it only once, but you've got to have it!"
4,"hyde park,1969 rolling stones","This disc is afine time capsle for any rolling stones fan energeticly paced, filmed on a warm summers day two days after Brian Jones had died. Funnilly enough the band wasn't playing in tune except for a very nervous Mick Taylor. Roumor is that Mick Jagger and Keith Richard were on a cocaine binge. All things consitered I woud rate video a8-10 and music 5-10 best of all it is worth a look."
3,Weird to say the least....,"After watching this film, I thought I was watching the second coming of the 3rd Reich. Lets just say it's no ""Gimmie Shelter""."
4,Great Shirt,This shirt looks just like it does in the picture. My only problem is that it was a bit smaller than expected. I would advise you to order a size up if you are going to buy this one.
4,"Great Set, But Don't Buy It","The English Concert's Vivaldi recordings are THE period instrument versions to own, but this fine compilation has now been been superceded by the newer, 7-CD box that includes all of the English Concert's Vivaldi recordings. The older, 5-CD box inexplicably omitted the EC's stunning version of the ""Four Seasons"", which is not to be missed."
5,Beautiful music and a great value for the box set,"The Vivaldi Concertos performed by the English Concert is incredible. I will look for other works and projects Mr Pinnock has worked on. I listen to it throughout the day and can easily be distracted by the beautiful concertos. I agree with the other reviewers, it does not all sound the same, each piece is unique, but you have to listen. If you don't ""listen"" and have it on as background noise, then like any other sounds television, radio or other music type, it will all sound the same."
2,THE SOUND IS AWFUL,"I REMEMBER THE CONCERT TAPE THEY MADE IN 1978. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS DISC. THE MOMENT I PUT IT ON, THE SOUND WAS AWFUL. I COULDN'T ENJOY THIS DISC. BEING A BIG ELO FAN I WOULD RECOMMEND THE WINTERLAND '76 SHOW 5 STARS, AND THE NEWLY REMASTERED ""THE NIGHT THE LIGHT WENT ON IN LONG BEACH""."
3,Interesting.....but somewhat disappointing,"For those of us hardcore fans that choose to disregard ELO Part II, this is all there is....unless Reprise finally releases Jeff Lynne's 2nd solo album in 1999. Live at Winterland is much better as the band doesn't play against their own backing tapes as on Live at Wembley. These 2 live albums are probably no more than Don Arden's last squeeze of cash out of the ELO legacy."
3,No surprise here,"Suprising to me that so many folks don't know ELO used background tapes during the live shows. It's obvious during the sonic transition from 'Standing In The Rain' to 'Night In The City', when the band starts to actually play live. Tapes are used in varying degrees throughout the performance, blending with live playing, and it's almost impressive how they were able to pull it all off. Their front-of-house sound guy must have been working his tail off mixing all of this! Still, they should have stuck to doing only songs they could actually perform, and they had the talent to do it, since they pulled off Mr. Blue Sky, and Telephone Line, almost entirely live. My biggest gripe is that the cello players are not in the mix at all. The strings are all taped, and these guys are actually playing...! Watch their hands, there's no doubt they know what they're doing!"
3,Not quite classic,"I remember buying the DVD and ordering the CD at the same time for my collection, I was pumped. Then I was nailed down by standing in the rain. Did they play a tape and lip-synch it? or did they actually sound just like track 10 on Out Of The Blue. The sound quality could've been wayyyyy better. I had fun listening to it and I liked it, but Winterland is more powerful."
5,Cheeky Monkies tear it up on Leland Hotel,You should definitely check this out. Great mix of quirky pop and edgy alt-rock tunes.
2,Straight to video?,"If this had been a movie, it is my belief it would have gone straight to video. It only came out in hardcover because the publishers knew Ms. McDarmid's name would sell, no matter how very awful the book is. It's hard to believe that the author who wrote A Place of Execution, a truly brilliant mystery novel, could also produce such drivel as Killing the Shadows. Cliched (this is the break we've been waiting for!) and cluttered with poorly written ""romance"", this book is the written equivalent of a teenage slasher flick. Serial killer running around and all the potential victims acting as stupid as humanly possible."
1,Serious need for proofreader,"The extremely inadequate proofreading of this book made the reading very tedious and detracted from the story itself. There were egregious errors on every page, for instance multiple uses of ""die"" rather than ""the."" If the Kindle for Mac version I received was scanned from a printed copy I am surprised the book ever made it into bookstores. I'm not sure what Amazon can do to redress this issue, but I hope someone will look into it. McDermid is a great writer and deserves better delivery of her efforts than this rendition."
1,a bore,I really enjoyed A Place of Execution but couldn't even finish this one. What was interesting and unique about her previous book was endless and contrived in this one.
3,What Has Happened to Val McDermid?,"This book was going along pretty well (although I wasn't particularly taken with any of the characters) but it sort of fell apart in the middle. I know why her character went to Spain (but I can't say because it would be a spoiler) but this section quickly grew very uninteresting and the book never recovered its momentum.Also, this is another one of those books where there is not much suspense about whodunnit. This can be well done, but it wasn't well done here. The book is a journeymanlike work without the spark that keeps one reading late into the night.The story of Fiona Cameron's emotional problems surrounding her sister's death is also unsatisfactory and rather wimpy and the climax of the main story is-- well, anti-climax. I don't know if she has just lost interest or what, but I wish she would go back to doing what she used to do so well, throat gripping suspense. I wonder if this series has been optioned to a television production company yet?"
1,I struggled to finish this book,"Having been a fan of Ms. McDermid from reading Wire in the Blood and the two follow up books, then reading A Place of Execution and becoming completely hooked I expected great things from 'Killing the Shadows' but found I trudged through this book with no real feelings for the characters and found the motive for the killings to be a really big stretch! The side trip to Spain could have been missed out completely.I can't say I am sorry to have finished reading 'Killing the Shadows' as I found it tedious and uninspiring. Hopefully Ms. Mcdermid's next book will be up to her usual standards."
2,A sad voice...,"I found Vari Sylvester's performance a bit disappointing. Her voice on this audiobook is too monotonous, most of the character are read in the same tone so that listening to her can become tiresome at times."
3,Too much detail!!,"This was the first book I've read by Val McDermid, and although it had potential, the author ruined it with too many details (I mean, did she really need to include every newscast, news articles, online articles, meaningless romantic emails etc etc??).And the first part of the book when she travels to Spain is just unneccessary. How did that relate to the story??My biggest disappointment was that she wrote down every little detail all through the book except in the end. The ending was just abrupt, and I had many unanswered questions.However, I give it 3 stars, because at times the book was really good. And the writing was very good too. Without all the unneccessary details and scenes, it could have been a great book."
1,Really baaad book,"The characters in the book act and talk so stupidly, while supposing to be brilliant. The plot is convoluted. The motives are unbelievable. It's repetitious. It's a waste of time. After enjoying the first quarter of the book, I plowed through the second quarter, before giving up in disgust.It's not logical.For example, after two writers have been murdered, the good guys figure out a connection to a third having gone missing. They illogically conclude because of the connection, that #3 has been abducted. Where did abduction come from? The others were K I L L E D."
3,A Little Expected,"I liked the book but it was sadly typical of most detective strories, even though the main character is a female."
4,A Thrilling Ride,"A serial killer is stalking and executing thriller writers in manners scripted in their novels.Psychologist Fiona Campbell is drawn into the case when her lover Kit Martin is targeted as a potential victim.Campbell is a psychologist who uses computer technology to help law enforcement in locating offenders through crime linkage and geographical profiling. She has sworn never to work again with the Metropolitan police after they ignored her advice and messed up an investigation. This has created a rift between her and longtime friend, Detective Superintendent Steve Preston. This breach increases with dramatic results when Preston fails to give adequate support to Fiona's fears.The novel has a number of subplots which initially appear to be distractions. Yet nothing is ever quite as it seems in a McDermid thriller. She neatly ties everything together with compelling surprises and plot twists.An enjoyable, if nail-biting, ride."
4,I recommend it,"I bought the duvet cover and the sheet set. They are soft. The duvet cover it is heavier than expected. I use them only during the cold season, mainly winter."
3,On the cusp of a breakthrough,"This album always strikes me as similar to Episode. Both have great tracks and yet both rarely get a spin at my place due to the inclusion of so many naff tracks. An example of the former from this album would be Distant Skies. Not the first time that a band has shown it's mortality and human fear of flying and it won't be the last. The inherent humour in the subject (excepting Saxons 747 - Strangers in the Night) is always fun.As for the rest, well - just go straight to Visions. And if you despair at the constant restraint shown by this band get a copy of Visions live."
1,HORRIBLE,"Horrible, just that. No feeling, no emotion, it seems some machine is playing the instruments. This is not what heavy metal is all about."
5,"Wonderful, diverse","This is a great recording of Yo-Yo Ma at his finest, with the best of Cello Concerto repertoire. Such a varied set of compositions, each performed beautifully."
4,Solid thelogical food for the soul,Teaching Luther's Catechism IIby Herbert GirgensohnGood and interesting study on Luther's Catechism - recommended.
3,Title is accurate,"There is not much meat to this, mostly a list of who's read Horace and how did that influence those writers"
1,Stay Away from this like the plague,"The mugs LOOK nice. The quality of the mug itself is great, but the logo is not etched on them, it is an aluminum like insignia that falls off the second or third time you wash them.The mugs have a sticker that says that they cannot be put on the microwave or on the dishwasher, so I took all the care with them. Took one to my work, had a few cups of coffee and then washed by hand just to end up with the logo on my hands due to the cheap glue they use. And this happened with BOTH mugs.On the other hand the seller was very understanding and gave me refund on the mugs, kudos to them for that. I would gladly buy again from them due to their excellent customer service."
4,Snip for fun,"I discovered this book after watching the author on a sewing tv program. I really like the impressionist art style and thought what a great way to combine two art forms. However, in the tv show, she showed how to make flowers. They are NOT included this book. I did make the wreath that she discusses in the book and in one afternoon, I had a beautiful wallhanging. The step by step directions are great. Don't be intimitated by the samples she gives, just go for it!!"
5,Totally Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I recomend this game for everyone. It is so much fun. Once you start playing it you will get sucked into a world of adventure. You will really like it every time you play.Gameplay-10/10Graphics-9/10The touch Screen is always in 3d. The other screen is in both 3d and 2d. They show clips of the movie on the top screen (which you will enjoy.) This game is both easy and hard. Until the level Lemur liberation it is easy. Pn after that it gets harder and harder. I myself haven't finished the game yet but I really enjoy it. It isn't a waste of money or time.If you like Madagascar the movie you'll definetly like the game.
1,Not as good as the movie.,"Like most games, this game is not as good as the movie. The movie was not superb, and neither is this game ... by a long shot. There are rather repetetive levels, no real voice acting, and very tedious ' missions ' . it didn't seem like the creators even tried to make use of the DS's graphical capabilities.Verdict: don't buy it.. only RENT IT for a little boy or girl who enjoyed the movie."
2,it is a lot of junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it stinks it is so easy it took me 10 days to finsh it. It is great for people who are youngand who don't know how to play very well! I would not recomend it.love, poopsey and his dog poopsey (~: (-:"
3,Not All Dimensions Provided,"The outer dimensions of this pan are: 12-7/8"" x 18-3/16"". I bought two of these and they look very substantial, but seeing as nothing over 17"" will fit in my oven, I don't think I'll be able to use them. I wish that the OVERALL dimensions would be provided for this kind of item. So two stars off for bad product description."
4,Very heavy duty.,I finally needed to replace some cookie sheets and these caught my eye. My only disappointment is that they are not very deep. They look that way in the picture and the description does say it will double as a jelly roll pan but they are not as deep as the last sheets I had.The price was good so I can live with them.
1,Nice...except when you need service.,My brand new Monitor...less than 6 months old...starts smoking and spitting sparks...then little flames come out of the top....If I was not home...I am sure my house would have caught fire.So...I send this thing back...it cost me 82.00 to have it packaged and shipped by UPS (Viewsonic won't pay me back)Viewsonic will replace it...but...since they don't have one in stock...I have to wait. All the resellers have plenty in stock but the factory is out?I have been waiting over 3 weeks now.Also I have to call them to get this information. I would think after they promise a 5 day turnaround once they recieved the old on...they would at least give me an e-mail to explain the delay.If I was not so impressed with the product (when its not on fire)...I would tell everyone to stay away from this company.
1,I will never buy another viewsonic product,"I bought my P22FB monitor in June of 2003. It worked fine for 11 months & then started jittering very badly. I sent it in for warranty service (it had a 3 year warranty) & got it back a month later, working again. Less than a year and a half later, the same problem surfaced again. I sent it back again & it has now been over 2 1/2 months & I still don't have my monitor back. Plus, Viewsonic has mistakenly shipped me TWO 17"" monitors since that time. Most of the time you can't get through to their support line at all & when you can, it usually means a 30+ minute wait. I have to assume that either their products are breaking down at very high rates or their support lines are woefully understaffed. They have been extremely unresponsive to both phone calls & email & don't seem to me to have any commitment whatsoever to customer service. I will never buy another product from them, no matter how much technical praise they may receive."
4,Good for early gamers,"My daughter is 7, and is just getting into Gameboy games. This is one of her favorites. I can certainly see where it would get old fast for more experienced gamers, but for beginners it provides enough direction and progress to keep them going."
3,Easy but keeps you going,"This isn't the funest game in the world, but if I was bored I pulled that game out. It was pretty easy, but it's more of a game for younger kids. I reccomend it for 8 and down. It's still pretty fun for 9 and above, so I give it a 2.5. Melmen's the best!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. I have this game on GBA"
3,too easy but it's fun,"I got this and won it it 2 days (it was late afternoon the first day anyway). It is way too easy! It's a lot like Tigger's Hunny Hunt... what with someone hopping and you can only go left and right across the screen. Melman is hilarious - he can sneeze to attack, he can hide his head in the ground and look like a tree, and later in the game he can sneeze in the air and go really high - something like Alex's double-jump only better."
3,An OK Game,"I purchased this game for my 6 yo daughter and she likes it. When I asked whether she liked the game, she said it was an OK game."
1,Frustrating Game!!!,i love the movie so i thaught the game would be really cool too.It turned out to be totally frustrating and annoying.the Opporation Ship Sneak where you have to collect all the coins without anyone seeing u is the most frustrating.I couldnt stand it so i quit the game from then.. my sister ended up finishing it.I would usually play my games over and over agian like Star Wars Episode III Revengeof the Sith (extremely fun)but i wouldnt even think about playing this one ever again.If i knew it was so stupid i woudnt have bought.Save ur money and dont buy it!
5,Daniel likes it,My 5 year old son Daniel really enjoys this game and I just enjoy the piece and quiet it gives me once in awhile!
4,Will get you up to speed with MX 2004 quickly,"I took a quick flip through and it looks good! Nice thick book, over 800 pages and it certainly covers a lot. I like the ""Points to Remember"" after each chapter. This is good for people like me who like to scan through information quickly. There's a whole chapter on video which is helpful. Part 4 - Extending Flash is of particular interest. It introduces Accessing External Data (XML, etc) and Advanced Communication (Flash Remoting, Flash Com Server). Part 5 gets into more advanced concepts like OOP, math, and manipulating 3D effects. This book even covers Developing for Pocket Devices. The writing style is clear and easy to understand. Included are icons along the side which point out tips, cautions, what's new in 2004, etc.The companion site ...contains source files.My first impression, this is a good book if you want to get up to speed with MX 2004 quickly. Congrats, nice job guys!"
3,"Decent, but not relevent now","This book got me started with Flash some years ago. It did well for a while, but there was a lot of focus on working with the stage and timeline as opposed to coding with Actionscript as most Flash developers need to do today. Things have definitely changed in the world of Flash development. AS3 is the new standard and I recommendEssential ActionScript 3.0 (Essential)for modern development."
1,I hate it,Bad service and price. Bad Orden and full shipped. Excelent presentation. Bad work. Its very nice item. Full services and Very type.
2,Was it really even worth making?,"Being a moderately big fan of Unearth, I bought this mini-DVD a while back, put it in, and turned it off halfway through the first song. The audio is horrible. The video is good; good angles, energetic crowd and band, but the audio is dreadful. I let my friend, who had never heard any of Unearth's song before, watch this DVD, and he said something along the lines of ""that's just noise""! And from just watching this DVD, you'd get the impression of Unearth actually just being pure, plain white noise. Which is a shame, because they actually write some interesting, complex metalcore tunes. And the backstage stuff isn't very much of a bonus either. So is three live songs with horrible sound quality and about a minute of backstage footage worth it? Not unless you're completely obsessed with Unearth. Hopefully they'll release a full length DVD with much better quality sometime, but this little thing isn't worth it, even for $4."
3,eh...,"this dvd is like...10 minuets long. it contains three tracks, mic'ed live recordings, and they aren't really very good. the discription promises 'unearth live music, and backstage antics'. The 'backstage antics' consist of like A minuet of crap in a little box on the side of scolling credits... Oh well, i was entertained for 10 minuets because i really like unearth, so basically, if you like unearth, and don't mind spending like seven bones on this dvd (which is cheap...) then go for it, its pretty rad for fans."
2,Not Live,"the tracks have been edited in a studio, and the songs aren't available in audio format (can't listen to it on a cd player). Still worth the price, but not great."
4,Stunningly shocking,"As a big fan of Unearth this was a muct have DVD, espically for the low price. However there needs to be a longer running time on it and it's not as good as DVDs from such artists as Throwdown and Bleeding Through. Buy this DVD."
5,Waiting for rest of series,"This is a great series and well worth the money to purchase... This is the way TV shows are meant to be seen... Not the crud on there now-a-days...I have loved this series for years and like others here and on other websites... I think it is appalling that for one it has taken this long to even come out with Season 1, much less have to wait infinity for any of the other seasons... It would be nice if it is taking this long that some of the 80's interview and commercials would be on the next discs for extras as well as current interviews of the remaining cast members (even down to the boys).We can only hope... Scarecrow and Mrs. King will always have a place in the hearts of the fans that still look forward to watching it on a regular basis..."
5,I watched it. I loved it. I can't wait for the next season.,"I just finished Season 1, and it's as good as I remember it. Thank you for finally releasing it. Now, please release the other seasons as soon as possible. I hope we don't have to wait until 2011 for SMK Season 2 (though I'll buy it whenever it comes out)."
5,nancycain,"I think this was one of best shows on TV, it has everything, suspense, romance, laughter, family values, and more..... please release all of the four season soon."
5,Scarecrow and Mrs King finally on DVD.,Have been waiting for this TV series to be released on DVD for a long time. Loved watching the TV program. Anxiously awaiting the release of season two in March 2011!
5,Forgot How Good It Was,"I remember watching this series when I was in school. Now that I have purchased this first year series, I forgot how much I liked the series. I can not wait for the rest of the series to be released. Wouldn't it be great if they would do a reunion movie? Have Lee work Billie's position, Lee and Amanda with triplets who now grown join the Agency and find out they are a spy family?They sure do not product series like this anymore. Buy it--you won't be sorry."
4,The DVD: Scarecrow & Mrs King,"Love this show! A lot of people have been waiting a long time for this. I had to mark it down 1 star. It would have been two, but I love the show itself too much.CONS:* No Extras* No Interviews* No Episode Previews.* No Bios.* Only English Subtitles.* Film defects can be seen in the DVD, especially the title shots. Little white spots in the sky.PROS:* Easy DVD access* good (not great) booklet.* Excellent Cover (case and slip)* Great Chapter marks."
5,2008 is the perfect year to release this series!!!!,This year marks 25 years since this show began. It was my favorite show growing up. Why make us wait so long??? How about releasing all seasons in a box set so we can just buy it all at once? Please release this wonderful series now!!!!
4,Dated but still entertaining,"I was a big fan of the TV show when it was on, so I was glad to get the first season on DVD. It is now quite dated, but still charming thanks to Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner. Fun to watch again!"
5,WooHoo!,"Well, it's in transit! How awesome is that!Eagerly awaiting for it to arrive. Now I can finally retire my poor old VHS tapes from the Family Channel and Pax days of SMK. I will absolutely be ordering the next seasons when they come out - no question on that.I'm not a big fan of buying entire dvd collections of tv series - until now. This will be the 1st one for me and I can't think of a better show than this.Once it arrives, will probably post another good review for it - don't think there's anyway a bad one could happen unless we get a bad DVD copy.Fellow SMKS fans - ENJOY!!!!!TS"
4,'Thanks for the Memory.',"This was television at its height. No ambiguities, no 'hidden' social messages, no so-called socially-redeeming value, no political agendas or phony reality. It was just pure new-age entertainment and escapist fare. That's what entertainment was all about. Count on Amazon.com to have what you want, when you want it and in a timely manner, too!"
4,scarecrow and mrs king dvd in demand,what is the hold up with the seasons dvds .i have seasons 1 and 2 of scarecrow and mrs king. i am still waiting for the rest to come out. I AM a huge fan of this series I ENJOY THIS SERIES VERY MUCH. I WATCHED IT WHEN IT FIRST CAME ON TV AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I WAS HAPPY THAT IT FINALLY CAME ON DVD
5,Gotta Make This Happen,I have been looking for this show to be released for years!! I will buy every episode from every season as soon as I know it have been released. Make it happen and my wife will love you forever!
4,Fun and endearing adventures,"I loved watching this show when it was on the air and was lucky enough to see a few reruns years ago and saw some episodes for the first time- but I haven't seen it on in a long while. I only own a handful of television shows on DVD - but this series would definitely make my ""buy"" list. Remington Steele and Greatest American Hero are out, why not this one? I enjoyed it so much more!"
5,One of the best,"Scarecrow and Mrs King was probably my favourite show of the 80s and so I was delighted to find season one had been released. The show hasn't been run in the UK since it was originally aired and so the only way I have to enjoy it again after all this time is if it's released on dvd. Please, please can we have all four seasons, and soon."
3,audio leaves much to be desired,I purchased the entire series years ago assuming it would never be released from a company that taped it off the air. This release has some major audio problems. I have had to turn the interior AND exterior speakers up to full volume just to hear some of the episodes. I hope the next season improves the volume.
3,Scarecrow & Mrs. King: Season 1,"I like the Scarecrow & Mrs. King mystery series very much, but I didn't like the old boxed format and film quality available to view on Prime Video. I am too accustomed to the wide screen and HD quality videos, now, that I don't enjoy viewing the old standard quality any more."
5,Love these shows!!,Just wanted to let you all know that we love these shows and wish the rest of the seasons were already available for all of us!!! Excellent entertainment!!! So well done!! So fun too! All of the characters are great and wonderfully cast!!!
3,PLEASE RELEASE ALL SEASON OF SCARECROW AND MRS. KING!!!,"Please, please, please release all seasons of Scarecrow andMrs. King. It was a great show....lots of fun without the blood and gore that Hollywood seems to think is necessary today.I'll buy each DVD when they are released....please, please, please release them!!!"
1,Interesting that no DVDs exist when AMAZON shows several ads,"For those who think not having DVDs of ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" is a tragedy, well, isn't it interesting that these DVDs, which don't exist, which haven't been released yet, magically appear in several ads from which Amazon receives income, according to their own statement on the page? I ordered a set from TV SHOW MEDIA, tvshowmedia.com and I am still fighting to have this ""firm"" either credit my VISA account or send the DVDs. But now I'm not sure what to do? If so many viewers want the show, and if the show has not been released, then what's going on with the offers on Amazon's own site? If the DVD sets are legal, then why haven't fans found them? And if they are not legal, why is Amazon allowing the advertising? Makes me wonder!"
5,It's On it's Way,This Morning Warner Home Video made it official that they are releasing Season 1 of Scarecrow and Mrs. King on March 9. It will contain all 21 episodes of the first season on 5 different disk. For me it will be a first day buy. Thanks Warner
5,Love this show - please release it on DVD!,"I was making up my Christmas wish list for my husband, and wanted to put this series on my list. I can't believe it isn't available. Its awesome, great characters, great storylines, wonderful chemistry and fun. Please release it on DVD!"
5,great blast from the past,"What fun to relive this 1980s series all over again. The first season was great, only down side was that it left me wanting more - hope future seasons are released soon and hopefully with some extras like commentary from the actors or even promos or something from the original air"
4,A childhood favorite!,It's amazing how much I love this show after all of these years. Now my daughter is hooked on it too!
4,Scarecrow & Mrs. King.,"I had forgotten how it all started and was not disappointed watching the series. Kate Jackson had just come off the series ""Charlie Angels"" series and this was perfect for a cross-over."
5,Scarecrow & Mrs. King,Absolutly Love this series! Couldn't wait for the first season to be released and bought it as soon as I could. I spent the whole weekend watching season 1 as soon as I got it. Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on DVD!!!!!!!!! PLEASE RELEASE THEM SOON!!!!!!
5,Nothing Beats Old-School TV,I am SO happy to finally own the 1st season and am anxiously awaiting the following seasons (Hint Hint).
5,This show Rocks!,"I can't wait to see these shows again, I constantly check the TV to see if reruns are being played. What happened to this hit? I am looking forward to the day I can sit with my son and watch these reruns. What a classic. There is nothing else that can compare to this show.Catherine"
4,Scarecrow and Mrs. King,"This is one of those shows from the eighties that had charm and real chemistry between its main stars. Kate Jackson was a lot of fun to watch as divorced woman becoming spy. Bruce Boxleitner was my first real crush and a suave leading man who didn't take himself too seriously. Like most of the shows I remember from the 80's this seems to have been over looked by the studios. Thanks to cable I don't watch any network shows. However, along with ""Sledgehammer"", ""It's a Living"" and this show I could relive the 80's. Please release it on dvd. I would like to buy a whole season at a time though. The main reason for this is space. I have so many dvd's that storage is a problem."
5,Scarecrow and Mrs. King,"This is my favorite show of all time!!! I was devastated when the show was cancelled; I remember reading about the cancellation on the front page of my hometown paper! I loved every episode, from beginning to end. Watching the evolving relationship between Lee and Amanda was both fascinating and entertaining. I even found myself making up possible storylines for new episodes! As much as I loved the show, I knew that once Lee and Amanda married, that sounded the death knell for the show - there was no where else to go with the story. I've been searching for this series on DVD for what seems like forever. To say I'm excited about it finally being available would be an understatement; it's about time!!!"
3,Got my toe wet wth this one,"Metal Munching Maniacs: Gourmet Damage (2003)it's cheap for DVD around $12.00 why only 3 stars the matches are so fast which is good and bad. It's not the same battle for 15mins. on the flip side I would of like to see some major damage - more smoke, fire. Another plus interviews which I liked. Over all it was a fun DVD.If you like robot and destruction. Grab a copy"
3,Tough but Interesting,"The book is basicly a game. In this case, a game that insists that one go through is insufficient. Another nice thing about this book is that it is its own story with a basis in the Lone Wolf series, but challeneges you in a different way. All in all, it was fun."
1,HipGear,"Worked great for the first couple of weeks. Only used it for about 6 hours, then notice that that batteries super-heated to the point where you could not touch them without burning your fingers...oddly even then the unit seemed to work, but of course the batteries did not last more than a few minutes.Tried a fresh set of batteries....same result. Wonder if there is some kind of RF feedback loop or something that superheats the batteries.Anyhow, can't use it now and not sure where to get it serviced or replaced as it is still under warranty. Anyone else experience the same problem&gt;"
4,As advertised good price,The product is good quality at a good price. Looked all over for something to go with our decor and this was it. Compared to twice the price at local retailers.
5,Huge! Great...,"This product is truly great, has basically any Ukrainian word you can think of... even many slang words. Keep in mind, this book is only Ukrainian - English. It does NOT include English - Ukrainian. I purchased it without realizing this. Still, a valuable asset, especially if needing specific Ukrainian words.Also, keep in mind that the book is huge. About 8 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 2 1/2 inches thick. It ways a good 4 or 5 pounds... many words."
2,Only Ukranian to English,We bought this in hopes of helping us learn Ukrainian only to find that it translates only Ukrainian to English and not English to Ukrainian. Make sure you already speak Ukrainian before you purchase this!
1,Good grief,The author appears to live in a bizarre and fearful fantasy world. This book reads like exceedingly bad science fiction. Don't waste your money.
5,Poetic style and speed; Plot a drama of irresistable simplistic depth,"Poetic style and speed; Plot a drama of irresistable simplistic depthThis film had me walking out of the theater and down Mercer Street wondering where I was and what I had just gone through. An incredibly vivid portrayal of young love and the motivations of a young woman's loyalty to her criminal-on-the-run lover.While the plot needs tightening for a mass market and the dialogue suffers the character's blunt personalities, this film is a tribute to what one can do with a real story, which this is based on."
3,I am forced to write a review of a review,"From Texas is way out of line here. What gives her the right to openly insult Muslims on Amazon?? I am utterly horrified and if I may say, as a former Christian converting to Judaism, take a look at your own faith, honey. Ever hear of the Spanish Inquisition or the French Wars of Religion???? PS, FREE SPEECH LIVES, and every person of every belief STILL has the right to publish what he wants."
2,Wild=Imitations,"Wild is just an imitation of Bond. Even their album cover is somewhat similar to Bond's ""Classified"". I think they should be more original. Buy any of Bond's Cds...U are better off."
1,Not very Hip!!!,I had two of these. Both times the controls started pulling everything to the left on the screen when I wasn't even touching the control. Both times this controller started out great but after about a week it went bonkers.
4,Great controller for the $$,"I have used a few wireless controllers on my Xbox...the Madcatx original bulky one, both logitech versions, and the Pelican controller. I like my old (...)retail Logitech controller and still use it. The smaller (...)Precision verison has some major problems with the analog sticks not working right and sticking sometimes...but if you get a good one..it is a good controller. After 3 exchanges at Walmart though, I got sick of trying to find a good one. At Sam Goody, I saw this HipGear controller and (...)...decided to try it. I like it alot! The layout is really close to the Microsoft S design and the RF seems really good. It doesn't have the same expensive feel of the factory controllers or the Logitech versions, but it does look ok and feels solid. The digital pad feels weird, but works fine. The analog sticks work very well and so do the triggers. If you want to save some money, go with the Hip Gear or spend a little more and get the Logitech original (...)"
3,Good and bad,"It is a good game.I have never played a digimon game before.I have played both Dawn and Dusk, and of course like all pokemon sets, there's nothing different except for the types of digimon you can capture.The game has..well, many flaws that could have been improved before release.BUT! Since this game is most likely aimed at children, it's only us adult players who can find these flaws.The game is very addicting, however! I enjoy raising and battling my little digimon, and I like to breed them with my friends to make new digimon. Really, if you can get into the digi battling and raising, you can ignore the flaws of the game."
4,awesome game,A friend recommended this game and he's had a 99% success rate in suggesting games I might like. Glad I got it
4,Worth Every Penny,"I've only had this game for a few days and I would already call it one of my favorites. This was actually my first digimon game, so before this I was more into things like pokemon. Digimon are over-all easy to train so getting them to digivolve is pretty easy. The only real quirk is that whenever you digivolve there level gos back to 1. When you start you have 4 groups of digimon with 3 in each group. All of the groups have Coronamon (the digimon on the right of the cover)and the other two are at high levels and epic. I would suggest this to any person who like Pokemon or Digimon!"
5,What your tired feet are looking for,"This foot wash is absolutely the best for tired, achy feet. I work at a job where I have to stand and/or walk for 8 hours and after scrubbing my feet with this and the foot scrubber mat they're ready for the day."
1,Stale. crumbly,"First of all in opening the box, we expected to small chocolate, the only smell was cardboard. Though the candies were of different shape and color everything tasted the same with no similarity to the flavor of chocolate in any way.It was truly a waste of money. You would be much better off in just buying a Hershey Bar from the grocery store, at least that tastes like chocolate and it isn't stale."
4,Overall good item.,"The item had some water wear which was not described by the seller, but other than that it was in good condition and delivered very promptly."
4,Intense.,"Architect Jude Daniels was convicted of manslaughter over a design that collapsed. Hope Thompson had fallen in love with Jude after he went into partnership with her father but she showed doubts about Jude when testifying on the stand during his court trial. To help Jude win parole, Hope marries him, but Jude has sworn only hatred for his new wife. They enter into a reluctant partnership to prove Jude innocent.An emotional ride with two struggling individuals who must learn to trust and believe in each other before they can truly love. If you are a fan of Sellers' sheikh stories, be warned. This is a much more intense story, but if you like this style of book, you will love WIFE ON DEMAND."
1,Garbage,"After reading the glowing reviews of this candy I had to try them and I'm sorry I wasted my hard earned money. First off they are made from the cheapest disgusting dark chocolate I have ever tasted and the filling isn't much better, in fact the only thing nice about this candy is the nice box they come in (Which probably taste better then the contents) and thats where it ends. Believe me if your looking for good European chocolate this isn't it"
5,Paul's the Man,Paul Pigat is one of the best rockabilly guitar instructor's out there! I am very happy with the progress I have made following all his DVD's. Thank you Paul.
3,Not a systematic course,"From the title of the DVD I expected Paul Pigat to present an introduction to rockabilly. This is not the case, though. He delves right into teaching riffs and licks. He does this, it has to be said, in a very thorough and patient manner. Paul is a very good teacher. Had he only chosen a systematic approach! ""Rockybilly Licks"" would have been a more appropriate title for this DVD.Unlike most other instructional DVDs, this one doesn't contain the tabs, which must be downloaded from the publisher's website ([...]).For the beginning rockabilly guitarist, I recommend Fred Sokolow's Rockabilly Guitar DVD; he takes it from the ground up (avoid his book on Rockabilly Guitar, however)."
3,Key Rockabilly Riffs,This video isn't a guide to Rockabilly guitar. It shows you a set of riffs to learn. Paul takes his time and goes very slow. He is a very good teacher but this video is limited as far as the material he shows you.
4,Great Publication - A- for the book!,There are more words and concepts than bone-crunching figures. Without analyzing figures it is hard to decide whether learning Financial Risk would be as useful. Plain Flat text books still prevails this arena.
4,My favorite SEP book,"I really enjoy Susan Elizabeth Phillips. Her writing is always fun. I think I've read almost all of them and, with the exception of one or two, loved every one of them. But Match Me If You Can is by far my favorite. I think it must be the one-liners in this story that captured me. That and Annabelle's drive to succeed even when faced with defeat. Heath Champion is man who needs to fall a few rungs down the ladder, and watching love smack him down to the ground is by far the best. After all, it takes love to furnish a house and his so needs furnishing!"
5,Definitely a keeper!,"I rarely hang onto audiobooks, but I've already listened to this one twice through, and plan to keep it in my library. I'm impressed with Susan Elizabeth Phillips's way of giving the characters and situations that extra little something that makes one laugh out loud. Anna Fields was a great narrator; she was able to show emotion and distinguish character from character without going overboard on the voices. This is a great book!"
3,Ok...but not worth hardcover price for me....,"First of all, I am a huge SEP fan and have most of her books on my keeper shelf and have read each one several times. However, I regret the hardcover price that I paid for this one. The storyline was ok, and had some amusing moments, but it was far from what I have come to expect from this talented author. One of the quotes that I read prior to this book coming out was that ""this is her funniest book yet"". I personally found that to be way off base. This book is not in the same laugh out loud funny league as most of her other books from the ""Stars"" series. I agree with another reviewer when they said at times the secondary characters seemed more interesting and should have been given more page time. I have to agree. While there was little acted upon sexual tension between the main characters, Annabelle and Heath, the situation between Portia and Bodie was scorching. Again, it was an ok read, but one I would have rather picked up in paperback."
5,Sucks you in.,"You know how it's going to end from the very beginning, but it still sucks you in. I read it in one day (much to my husband's dismay - but the perfect way to spend a rainy Saturday). I like SEP, and this book doesn't disappoint."
5,Words cannot describe...,"MY SHEER JOY!!!! Susan Phillips is the ONLY author I will buy unread and unseen, even if I'm not totally happy with the story (just a couple of times)-She's one of the very few authors that hits WAYYYYYYY more than she'd ever miss. LOVE HER AND LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! I have not been this excited about reading an SEP novel since I read ""Dream a Little Dream"".I have taken every free moment-not very many-to finish this book, and I am reading again.That hasn't happened since I read my first SEP novel, ""Nobody's Baby But Mine"" eight years ago.Note to Susan: Please-just one more Stars' book?? Rosie (from NBBBM), Pippi, Dale, even Edward (from DALD)??? Simply can't wait for the next one...Whatever story you decides to tell next, I'M THERE!!!!! You go, Miss Susan!!!!"
3,Good but definitely not her Best,"I'm a big SEP fan and have read many of her books. I read the reviews here and was really looking forward to a 'great' read. I have to say I was a little disappointed. It's definitely not up to Dream a Little Dream or Nobody's Baby But Mine. While it was an unexpected treat to catch up with some of the Stars series characters, like Molly and Phoebe, the book was just too predictable. I realize that romantic comedies are all going to follow the same path to a happy ending, I guess I just expected a little more sparkle and shine. Some of it was a little absurd, like the Portia Powers character. The 'Blue Face' scene, while funny, just seemed very unbelievable. Also, the relationship initially between Portia and Bodie is a little disturbing, although as it grows, it's a nice background story. I'd still recommend it because I think her dialog between characters is smart and funny, it's just not one I'd gush over."
4,A CLEVER TITLE!!,"Match Me IF You Can was a very pleasant read. Liked Annabelle right away, but had to reserve my feelings for Heath for a while. The repartee between him and Annabelle was so amusing and different that I really got into this book easily.I so enjoyed seeing Phoebe and Dan; Molly and Kevin and the children from SEP's previous stories once again. I especially got a huge charge out of ""Pippy"" and her sweet affection for ""Pwinze"". Laughed out loud at the Princess party. Been there, done that. It was just one good laugh after another.I thought Bodie was HOT and respected his insight into Portia's angst even tho I raised an eyebrow or two! :D Heath's version of Annabelle's family's treatment of her was an interpretation I was glad to accept. All SEP's books end with a soft spirited conclusion. Will anxiously await the next."
5,Another great SEP. book!,This was another great SEP book! Although not on purpose I started with the last book - A Natural Born Charmer - in the series first I've really enjoyed both books.
4,Fun Read,I love Susan ELizabeth Phillips. She always makes me laugh. The characters in this story are cute and definitely enjoyable.
3,Not up to SEP's usual...,"Being an avid SEP fan, I couldn't wait to get my hands on MATCH ME IF YOU CAN. And I read it in record time. The writing is smooth and the pages turn quickly. But there just isn't much to recommend. The two main characters were okay, but I never came to care if they got together either way. The secondary characters were more interesting and I wish their particular story had been fleshed out more. In fact, had the main characters and the secondary ones switched the story would have been more interesting. Seeing old characters was fun and added to the plot, but overall I was disappointed in this book. It isn't an awful book, it just isn't very memorable."
2,I tried to like it....,"I was excited to get this book because of the great reveiws it received. But I quickly became dissapointed. The beginning started off good and had lots of promise to be an exciting and enjoyable read...but after I read 40 pages still nothing exciting happened. It took forever for the two main characters to get together, I was bored with them. And I really got sick of hearing about all the friends and their boring lives. Usually I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips's novels. My favorites being Kiss an Angel and Dream a Little Dream."
4,PERFECT RAINY DAY READ!,"Susan Elizabeth Phillips has a great talent for combining beautifully human characters and incredibly funny situations to produce feel-good stories. Match Me If You Can is no exception. I found myself laughing out loud in parts, so be careful if you don't want strange looks when reading this book in public. I always look forward to Phillips' new publications and she never disappoints."
5,Love it! An absolute must-have,"This is my first book by author SEP and I am hooked! I couldn't stop reading nor did I want to. The dialogs were terrific, I kept cracking up and laughing out loud so that my husband had to know what was going on, and every time I simply answers: it's the book - I love it! Browsing through some of theses reviews I noticed that this is only one out of a series...now I have to go and find the other ones! I would love to see this made into a movie. Funny thing is I keep rereading certain chapters and dialogs because they are simply too good/funny."
3,Brand Names,Was anyone else disappointed that a third of the nouns were brand names? I enjoyed the other two thirds of the book.
5,Love It!,"I got engaged on Christmas morning and I saw that the metal was made of .925 sterling silver. So I immediately got online and tried to find the best silver cleaner because I know without the proper care sterling can and will tarnish. So I found this on amazon and was impressed with the longevity of the company and the reviews. I got this as well as the jewelry polishing cloth. I have never seen any ring shine so bright in my life! No one, and I mean no one, has any idea that the metal is sterling and that the diamonds are cubic. This cleaner makes your jewelry shine and you will not be disappointed. I would not necessarily use this on the stones itself, but the polishing cloth is amazing for that. I am not a big fan of liquid, runny shiner because it often makes your jewelry tarnish faster. This polisher is liquid but it is seriously thick and it creates a protector border to keep the jewelry intact. I say get these products because it is the best!"
1,One of the Worst Products I've Used,"Based on the 100% approval of 25 people, I bought this product. The product not only didn't do a good job, it actually made a slightly tarnished urn look worse. I spent three times as much effort and time using this product on a couple of pieces, with less results. I thought I must have been doing something wrong so I used my Wright's silver polish. Presto! Perfectly shined. On top of this, the Hagerty bottle smelled so bad that when I threw it out, I had to remove it from the kitchen trash container. I'm going back to my Wright's silver polish; it's so much more effective and easy to use."
4,Hargerty Sliver Polish,This polish was as I expected it to be and would recommend it to anyone. It was easy and fast. Did a great job.
5,Fantastic,"Excellent product. This is liquid silver polish, not a temporary dipping solution. It just took me 15 minutes to rub the black tarnish off 6 candle holders!"
5,Used this product for years,I find Hagerty silver polish to be the best on the market. It doesn't require a lot of polish or elbow grease to bring up a like-new shine to your silver pieces. Even the most heavily oxidized piece will respond to Hagerty silver polish.
5,Works wonderfully!,Used this silver polish on silver and silver-plated items which had accumulated years worth of tarnish. This polish performed wonders! All of the items came completely clean and are now gleaming.
3,Not to bad,"Bought this to clean my silver, and it does work however it is a little messy since it is more liquid than a paste"
3,Single Dad,"Back Cover description: Rugged Craig Haynes came from a long line of lady-killers. Lately, though, the single dad was targeting only Jill Bradford, his sons' new nanny. Two parts sweetness, one part sin, the pint-size redhead proved a wizard with his three rambunctious boys. So what made this miracle-worker insist she was strictly hired help? Could a houseful of Haynes males ambush her wary heart...and make her a mother and wife?Interesting that the plot involves both hero and heroine with past issues that get in the way of love. The story moves along and the relationship between the boys and Jill developes at an even pace. In the real world, they'd all be in therapy for a few years. This is the first book I've read in this series and I think I started with the last in the group. I'm looking for the others, hope I find them."
4,Delorme Street Atlas USA 2007,"I have an older version of the Delorme Street Atlas with the GPS Device. The new version work with the old GPS device, which was a surprise. If you are able to carry a laptop around with you, the GPS works quite well. Most of the addresses I have entered into the mapping program appear correctly. Works similar to the portable GPS type devices, however this allows you to print a map for future reference. Great program if it is on sale."
3,Street Atlas 2007,"I had used Street Atlas in the past, but over the past few years had been using Microsoft Streets & Maps. I found the latter to be easier to use and I liked the interface. So, this year, I decided to change back to Street Atlas 2007, thinking I needed a change. After loading SA 2007 on my computer, I noticed right away that the interface was really difficult to navigate. I am still learning how to do certain tasks that MS S&M made much easier. I zeroed in on a few locations in the Sacramento County area just to find that they are missing from the new version of SA 2007. Microsoft had these areas (new housing developments) in their 2006 version and DeLorme left them out of their 2007 issue. I am not satisfied with the new DeLorme product and will probably run out and purchase the Microsoft S&M 2007 version."
1,Maps Still Year behind the times,"I broke down and bought this software after having owned the 2006 version, what a waste of money. It does not list roads that are 8 years old and has my neighborhood listed as outside the city limits, we were annexed in 1999. These maps are not as up todate are mose online maps were 3 years ago. Oh well, I might try again in three or four years."
1,Don't know what they updated,"To install the product I had to go in an edit my regestry as it gave an erron on install. After getting it installed it then gave an error that the netlink settings could not be read, but I was still able to open the program. Everything seemed to work but if I clicked on the netlink tab it would say it could not connect which was expected, but when clicking on another tab after that caused the program to abend in erroe and shut down. So you don't click the netlink tab. Checking out the streets I found many major highways in the NC that were updated and their location changed not updated in 2007 even though the the changes were almost two years old. Found many major revisions on highways missing. Really bad software. One star is the lowest rating I could give this, no stars is better"
2,Grossly lacking in accuracy,"I live in an area where the roads have been established for over 20 years. These same roads are not accurately placed in SA2007. With an upcoming major drive cross-country, I question the reliability of any information from this product. After continuing on the proper road, only to hear, ""off route-recalculating"" every five seconds, it gets very frustrating. I'm going to have to cut my losses and look for a competitor's product with more accuracy and reliability."
3,Daníel Ágúst - Swallowed A Star,"Daníel Ágúst's debut, _Swallowed a Star_, represents his solo outing after being the voice for Gus Gus over the course of two albums. He eschews dance tracks for a more classical sound; the album swells with cellos. This is a personal move for Ágúst; ""The Moss"" dances around on it pizzicatos (a danceable version of this would appear on Gus Gus' album _Forever_, of course). ""Nobody Else"" shapes sharp intakes of breaths and bells to serve as the backdrop for lyrics that seems to have escaped from a disco track. Ágúst leaves a lot of spaciousness in his instrumentation, letting it remain sparse as necessary so that a fuller track like ""Intersection"" stands out. The bubbling electronics on ""If You Leave Me Now"" add a nice touch, while ""Love and Respect"" is nothing but strings. Though pleasant, Ágúst's voice has its limitations, and there's a lack of dynamic range to this album. Though he may have swallowed a star, he hasn't yet started to shine."
5,Excellent,"If you are new to The Verve this is where you should start - it's basically a Greatest Hits compilation in the guise of singles. But to be fair most of their singles were their greatest pieces of work - so it works out pretty well! There're a few OK songs (i.e. not up to par with the best) but LUCKY MAN, BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY, THE DRUGS DON'T WORK, etc. more than make up for the very few mediocre ones.If you're already into The Verve this is a worthy purchase - as a ""newbie"" it's the perfect place to start. Highly recommended to fans and non-fans alike."
1,Rubbish!,this book should be dismissed as pure fictional gibberish. Don't waste your time with this debacle.
2,so small sound,"When I heard this CD last night, I was very disappointed. I love the music of Pletnev. When I bought <Live at Carnegie Hall>, I heard and heard that CD. So I thought ""I will buy his CD all, and I bought <Scarlatti's Sonata>. The CD was also very good. The melody and technic caught me in every track. In Korea, there is not so many CDs about Pletnev. This Tchaikovsky CD is in Korea, but it was very very disappointed to me. Aboveall, the volume is very low. I can't hear the sound of this CD with my portable CD player at highest volume level. Although a music is very beautiful, it is useless to me.However, I want to hear Pletnev continuously. Because he is one of the greatest pianist in our world."
5,Helmac Pet Hair Pic-up Handle,The handle's size makes it easy to use. I like that it has an opening so that it can be hung on a hook in the closet.
5,Lovely poetry from a talented writer,"Quite possibly some of the best poetry I've ever read... elegant, original and exquisitely moody."
2,waited more than a collection of murals,"very poorly sewn from the day you received this book can not be opened in a way that can be enjoyed at all, tends to fall apart"
4,Easy to use...,Upside: Easy to clean and fill.Downside: Smaller than most others... and the tip is rather small so it takes a tiny bit longer for the water to flow.... but after using you learn how to adjust if you are use to larger models.I'd buy again.... but I'd be happier if it was cheaper. After shipping costs..the price is too high for a plastic item.
5,Useful,"Simple to use when needed. Small enough to easily carry in luggage. If you don't NEED an ELEPHANT, then why BUY one!"
2,Too Small to Be Useful,This only holds 4 oz. That's too small to be of help. Don't buy this. Get the 8 oz or larger size.
5,One of the best resources I've come across,"Santa dropped this one in my stocking. It's great, particularly if you are searching for half-ice drills -- about half of the 75 drills are designed for half-ice. The strength of this book is its emphasis on puck movement to create scoring chances. The corollary is also true -- by emphasizing movement on the attack, goaltenders also improve their positioning and mobility. The drills are well-suited to kids aged 9 and up. I have shared the book with other coaches and, perhaps the strongest endorsement --my house league hockey association has ordered copies for all of our coaches!"
5,Highly recommended,"Not only does this book provide you with detailed drills , it backs it up with specifics on what areas the drill works on , and highlights. It also has well written introductions on individual areas and the skills needed to to become a better offensive player , well worth the time to read and digest the knowledge it provides ."
4,A good book,"I haven't read many books about hockey coaching, but after recieving this book, I'm pretty happy with it. It teaches you the basic shooting principles and spends some time on each type of shot. Then it goes into sections about buildings skills for each type of offensive play your team might need to work on: 1-1's, setting up plays, etc. A good variety of drills are offerred in this book and the nice thing is you can photocopy them out one by one because they are restricted to facing pages - so that you don't have to carry the whole book around. I'll be using these drills with my kids roller-hockey team and I think it will help."
4,Excellent New England Recipes,Enjoyed this book very much - alot of variety pf New England seafood fare
4,Latin Party Music,Excellent Latin music for parties. Contains mix of various types of music. The music is sure to please everyone and keep the party going.
5,Beauty,"A great album from beginning to end...soulful...sexy...makes you wanna dance I could go on and on about El Camino. Buy this and let the sun shine year long, grab your lady and dance with a smile on your face!"
2,boring and badly edited,Did anyone do any editing on this? This was a waste of time and money for the buyer. There was so much repetition. The characters were dull and plot could have been interesting but was not well developed. It seems like the author just threw somethings together to get a book out and hoped that she could sell it to those who had originally liked her books.
2,Boring and disappointing,"My wife and I have followed this series from the start. I now regret the time spent with this last book. Very boring, with no continuity. Not to mention that not a book has been released in more than three years. We have lost interest......."
1,"Well-intentioned, but terrible","I just read the Booklist review (at the top of this Amazon page) and saw the description of Churchill's ""spare and eloquent"" writing. To me, it sounded like it was written by a 12-year-old, for an audience of 8-year-olds. Based on the other reader reviews, it sounds like maybe the earlier entries in this series are better, but I didn't make it past the first chapter in this one."
1,The worst and weakest...,"I have enjoyed the other Grace & Favor books but this one was so bad it didn't even seem to be by the same writer! I am very disappointed in this book.(SPOILERS) The murder is dull and plodding. There are several sub-plots and story lines, large and small. How many scenes do we need to sell a stupid motorcycle? Just sell it! How many scenes do we need to get the deputy moved in? Just move in! How many scenes do we need about GETTING MAIL BOXES?!?! What in the world was the skeleton all about? Why wasn't it resolved?There is scene after scene of filler, conversation after conversation about *nothing* and the ending is dreadful."
3,Grace and Favor,I have read this series from the beginning & Churchill has good plots. But I found this book a bit too repetitious. She kept repeating information she had covered previously. I really like her Jane Jeffreys characters better. However I will probably buy the next one anyway .
2,WHO'S SORRY NOW? I AM FOR HAVING WASTED MY TIME,I have read all of the GRACE AND FAVOR MYSTERIES. This one was trite and boring. The book jacket review was NOT an accurate description of the book. This will be my last book by this author. What a waste!
3,Not so bad,"Sorry to be out of the flow of reviews on this, but I did not find this such a bad book. Perhaps I have just read a later edition with some added editing. While I note the points, such as Lily not being as involved as in most, the skeleton situation not being an integral part of the storyline, along with variations from the other books, I didn't find these ruinous to this one. It's true, most authors' series tend to weaken as they go along, but don't see that here. I enjoyed the changes and interest factors among the participants in the story. A fan of the series needn't automatically skip this one, in my opinion. There aren't many of them, so go for it for yourself."
3,Arthurian speculations,"This is a very well researched book, and I am very impressed by Goodrich's connections from disparate stories into geographical and linguistic results. That being said, many of her claims and explanations are spurious, relying on an overriding implied belief. At best her results are inconclusive, if intriguing, while at the worst they are foolish."
2,Esoteric Jumble,"Being a real sucker for obscure theories, things Celtic and Scottish, symbols, medieval writings, etc., I stuck with this. But I hurried through it. It's an utter mess of some authentic-sounding insights, real scholarship (mostly others'), endless language games, and wild speculations and flights of fancy. If ever a writer has needed editor and an outline it is Goodrich. She has most impressive educational credentials (which I suppose is why I stayed with the book at first) but she seems to have missed freshman composition."
1,Unmitigated hookum,"I had a professor who once likened Ms. Goodrich's manner of research to that of a person much in love with a book and determined to never see it end. His other comment went along this line. (as Goodrich) ""Ah, I have my copy of Malory! Now I am in Scotland! Well, Malory describes a place much like this, so Arthur must have been here"" (as himself) ""...forgetting of course that, assuming Arthur even lived, the story would have taken place about 1000 years before Malory was born.""Goodrich is not a careful scholar. She is not even realy a scholar, if these are her credentials. Nor is she a good enough writer to provide much other than confusion to a standard reader of Arthurian material. This book, and those that followed, are a hopeless tangle of badly put together theories that bear as much resemblance to Arthur as ""Braveheart"" did to William Wallace."
1,Off topic and lots more,"The author is a very talented writer, but she fails to stick to what she is originally trying to explain. The farther the chapter goes the more off subject it gets. Furthermore explanations about certain things are placed in totally wrong chapters. The author also doesn't give background information for those who do not know a lot about this topic. Even is you know the Arthurian stories, it is difficult to grasp at what Mrs. Goodrich is talking about. Since she states what she wants to analyze and then starts analyzing without explaining the situation. In cocnlusion, if you don't have to waste then don't bother reading this book. And if you have that type of time on your hands please have some knowledge on the myths of King Arthur, or you will end up confusing yourself."
4,Nice addition to our Christmas collection,"Santa delivered this one just in the St.""Nick"" of time. Well constructed figurines that the kids will enjoy for years to come. Careful to keep away from chew loving dogs!"
3,"Good movie, lame DVD","This movie, an underrated classic from the '70s, deserves anywhere from 3-5 stars, depending on the viewer's tastes. I would rate it 4 stars, personally.I would warn potential buyers to know what they are getting, though. The transfer isn't bad, really, considering the time the movie was made, but this dvd is pan and scan, which is a travesty. An even larger travesty is that this is the only dvd available, to my knowledge. It kills me that so many worthless movies have been released on bluray (and not just recent movies), when stuff like this has barely been released at all.This is an intelligent action/ adventure film that cries out for, at the least, widescreen release, if not bluray, and all we have is this pan and scan version.Still worth buying for those who wish to see the film. It made Ebert's list of most unappreciated films of the '70s.I bought it just to show support for a better version."
5,best sleeper hit ever!,"This movie has got to be the best sleeper hit ever! The music the effects its all top notch. I would really like to know how they filmed the bridge sceen, the things they do with the trucks are just plain remarkable! I wish there was a making of feature on the disk. maybe sometime in the future they will make a special edition disk and even if they don't I will still be happy with what I have."
4,"Oh, It's the Name of the Truck","The first time I saw ""Sorcerer"" I made an unfavorable comparison of it to the original film version, ""The Wages of Fear"". On further viewing I now find this comparison unfair because ""Sorcerer"" stands up as a work unto itself. Blotting out all recall of ""The Wages of Fear"" I found myself caught up in this edge-of-your-seat tale of desperate men transporting nitro in squalid Latin America to put out a refinery fire. Director William Friedkin crisply paces his story for maximum impact. The editing and cinematography also enhance the story. Roy Scheider and the international actors here acquit themselves well. What was most striking to me was the production design of John Box. Awards are not given out for designing squalor. The jungle locales with all their pitfalls is also a major character here. ""Sorcerer"" is definitely a film to be discovered or in some cases rediscovered."
4,Roy Scheider at his best!,"If you love epic movies from the 1970s, 'Sorcerer' is your film. Roy Scheider is at the top of his game, and the cinematography is not only scary as all hell, but it's beautiful at the same time. A slow, concentrated film with a climax that will blow you away."
2,Great movie - Poor DVD,"This is one of those movies that will forever suffer comparisons to the original. I saw it on it's original release and have never forgotten it's very stirring images. I have waited a long time to get a worthwhile home video version, but this DVD is not it. For a start they should of released a widescreen version. Even though it was shot in 1:1.66 (not 1:1.33 as someone said) ratio as lots of films are it was obviously not intended to be shown, theatrically at least, in that ratio. Hopefully Universal will return to this film someday and give us a restored anamorphic widescreen Special Edition."
5,An Under-appreciated Masterpiece that deserves better,"This remarkable, albeit misnamed film, failed to get the critical praise it deserved upon its release in 1977 but more recently seems to have been granted proper status. Fans of this film are no doubt hoping for a better quality re-master with updated audio, especially given the astounding score by Tangerine Dream. Still, as long as this is the best version available, it is a must-have."
5,for once second part is best,"I ever thougth that second parts never were good, but in this case I must say not only this movie is one of my favourites, but for me is better than the first version ""Wages of Fear"" that is considered a masterpiece. Well, both films are very good. I know ""Sorcerer"" isn't the most popular nor valued but each one has his preferences and the theme of the man which has to figth with all chances against ever was my preferred and in this film these is very clearly put in the screen. Both films have very good players, but I think in this, is one of these rare cases when color and modern making better the final result, because in general, remakes are poor and low the dramatism, but undoubtly ""Sorcerer"" is an exception and has something ever impress me. There's not adventures for children and cinema of today almost never attains this."
3,"Grainy, but great soundtrack","Not much extra on the DVD- text cast bios and the trailer. Lots of dirt on the film used for transfer. If you like this movie, you may as well get the tape version."
2,Perhaps we will never see a proper version,"I hate giving this masterpiece a 2 out of 5 but it is the DVD that is in qeustion...not the film. Will a full aspect ratio version of this gritty film ever come out? Will we ever see a remastered copy? A Friedkin commentary? Probobly not. We see mounds of BAD films filling the shelves with dir. commentary and making of's. They have transfers that are impecable, yet worthy films are set aside, mastered from rotting prints. We know that Sorcerer is NOT a marketable DVD, the profit margins are too low. But when we see special editions for forgettable films that made little to no money at the boxoffice, it makes one wonder how these companies view their provocative films, what their scale of worth is.Maybe, it only adds to the film's flair; forgotten, but wicked, wicked cool."
1,"Hidden Aspect Ratio on DVD, unfortunately not correct.","I really wish that it were true that the original ratio is there, but just squished, as stated by Gary E. Maisack (Sorry Gary. Honest mistake, I'm sure buddy. ) But anyone with this DVD can check it out for themselves. The frame has been cropped and this is not a wide-screen version in any form. The proof: the picture on the back of the DVD. Look at the actors standing around. Go to the same scene in the movie and voilà: one actor is now cropped out, another is only half there.The only reason I point this out: Demand a Blu-ray of this great classic! Universal Studios put out Flash Gordon on Blu-Ray, but not this work of art. It's still in it's VHS release format. Shameful!"
4,I am not alone!,"This has been one of my all time favorite films since I first saw it in the theater decades ago. I saw it once, but its music and images have haunted me since. I am surprised how many other people feel as I do. Until this moment, I thought I was the only one who even remember this movie[...] Of all the new horrible movies out there, can't we save this one classic!One last thing, am I the only one who has noticed how much Apocalypse Now borrowed from this film?"
4,Sorcerer - feedback,"For being an old movie it was entertaining, I saw it years ago when it came out and it is still good, worth seeing."
2,"Fantastic movie, mediocre presentation","After having seen ""Wages Of Fear"" I was eager to see ""Sorcerer"", and as great a movie as it is, the DVD is presented in full screen format (yeccch!) and apparently transferred from a substandard master. I wish I could give two ratings, one for the movie itself (5 stars) and another for presentation (less than 1 star) but the rating system doesn't allow this so until a newer iteration appears, my rating will have to remain as it is."
4,Great Product! One of the only DUAL CARDBUS PCMCIA adapters out there.,"Although I had some problems getting my old Orinoco 802.11b GOLD and SILVER cards to work, that wasn't the reason I bought this item.I mainly needed something that could accept CARDBUS cards which actually contain a special slotting so regular DESKTOP PCMCIA readers cannot phisically read these cards properly. Most modern PCMCIA cards are cardbus today.Good product, no problems with cardbus cards!Fabian."
3,Good for a Laugh !,Pretty much how I remembered it all those years ago. A cheesy story with so-so acting. Fun to watch on a rainy when there's nothing else to do.
3,"Almost a straight video to dvd copy, quality is good.","Quality is good for TV in that day and time, wish it could be improved(video quality).Overall about what i expected."
4,A fun show,"If you're looking for period accurate or more of Indiana Jones this series might disappoint. If you're looking for a fun filled adventure show, this is the one for you. The flying scenes and the characters are good for the period. Some of the plots could be a little thin. Thick or thin, this show is always fun to watch."
5,Tales of the Gold Monkey,"Tales of the Gold Monkey was one of the greatest shows on TV in the 1980's when I was growing up. I remember this show but for the life of me I have been struggling to remember the name of the show for the last 5 years. I knew I the actor from 7th Heaven from somewhere but I could never remember why I remembered him.Jack the one eyed dog, is how I tracked it down as I put that in my web browser. I want so bad to buy the 21 episodes all on DVD for my step-father for Christmas but it's not available. He and I would watch it and laugh at the hilarity and silly things this ""Pirate"" gone good, the freelancing mercenary of the air with his pontoon boat in 1938, set right before the beginning of World War II.A great TV series and it should never been canceled."
2,"Fun show, poor audio","This is a fun show with a very likable cast. But the transfer leaves much to be desired. The video is only so-so... but acceptable I guess. The main problem; the audio transfer is really sub-standard. There is something wrong with the dialogue and effects mix. I don't know if it's a compression issue, or the original audio off the master tapes was poor to begin with? But this audio is not DVD-quality. The best way to describe it would be it sounds like audio off of an old, cheap VHS tape recorded at EP (lowest quality) speed. This issue seems to be on all the sets. I returned my initial set, got a replacement -- the replacement set had the same problems."
3,Not what I had expected,I had never heard of the series before and when I received it it was less than I had expected.
1,"No CC, No subtitles","My wife and I loved this show when we watched it in 1982. When we found out it was being released on DVD, we couldn't wait to get it. However, we are both a bit hard of hearing, and must rely on closed captioning, or subtitles to be able to follow the dialog. Alas, TOGM has neither CC, nor subtitles, rendering the DVD set useless for us."
2,Cheese-tastic!,While the plots were nothing original--one was directly copied from Magnum PI--it was mindless fun. It was one of those series I wanted to like more than I actually did. It may have grown into its own if given time.
4,Quality stands with time,"This show has humor and great actors! From Ba-Ba Black Sheep thru Magnum, Bellisario has entertained us with quality. A characteristic I like best is that you can see over time that he likes certain actors and has brought them back as other characters in the new shows throughout the last 30 years. An example of this is Marta Dubois and Jeff MacKay! If we look hard enough you can see some actors from Ba-Ba Black Sheep in the Monkey series also! This says alot for the producer and my age!"
5,Great TV series!,I loved this TV series when it was on. I wish it would be released on DVD so I could watch it again!! *hint hint*
3,Gold Monkey,"This series reminds me of Saturday afternoon at the movies when I was a child.Good entertainment if you want to get away from the trials and misery of the present day world.Don't take it to heart and go with the flow.A good follow-up to this series would be ""Black Sheep Squadron"" which is just as unbelievable, but good to watch if you like airplanes.Pharaoh."
5,Great TV show,I loved watching this when i was a young boy and I still do. I were pleased to see thiss TV show on DVD and purchased it as soon as possible.It is just fun to wach the episodes and the nice dialouges and humor.Simply a must buy!!
4,Tales of the Gold Monkey,"Never saw this adventure on TV. This adventure series is kind of hokey and funny. It's a kind of take off of the Indiana Jones movies, dealing with the Nazis and Japanese and others over artifact."
4,Great show,"Good family, aviation, adventure show. Still is a bit cheesey but it is fun to watch and safe to do so with the family. the dog and his eye is a crack up."
4,One of my favorite shows of my youth,"I've watched this show and liked it immensely especially after the hit movie ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but it got cancelled and I sort of forgot all about it until I heard the rumors it was coming out on DVD. I was excited at the prospect of owning a DVD set complete with extras from the show.Then, I find out someone who made this DVD set, didn't bother to put Closed-captions or add English subtitles to it, which infuriated me, (I'm hard of hearing, don't you know !) I waited 20 long years for this to come back only to get stopped by this glaring omission. Shame on the manufacturers/production company of this DVD set for not adding this one little (but important) item to the product (it's kind of hard to follow what's going on if you can't understand what the person's saying...(sigh).I'm sure there's lot of hard of hearing or deaf people who would love this gem for their film libraries, I know I do."
3,Memories,"I had been looking for this series for years. My son and wouldn't miss an episode if we could help it and were surprised when it was canceled. When I saw it had been released on DVD I ordered it from Amazon. When I watched the first episode I knew I would have to give it some latitude. It was done in the 80's after all. It was intended to be like the Indiana Jones movie that had been out before it. I soon realized it was hokier than I remembered. I really enjoyed the interviews with cast members. Don't expect great special effects, it was TV after all. The acting, well, I hope they had told the actors to ham it up. All and all, I enjoyed it because I had fond memories watching it with my son. But, as the man says, I like the memory of it but, perhaps I should have left it at that."
1,"Horrible, cheesy tv series!","My husband watched this as a kid so I thought it would be a good gift. We laughed so hard watching the first 15 minutes! Cheesy, bad acting... waste of money!"
5,Great series,"Wonderful entertainment and well-done DVDs. The quality is good, actually much better than I expected. The programs are just as great as I remember them from 20 something years ago. Well worth the money in my opinion. Once again I want to visit ""Bora Gora"" and go to the Monkey Bar! :)"
4,Vintage TV,"This was a favourtie waaaay back when, and it still hold an appeal for those of us over a ""certain age"". If you want a glimpse into the past of TV get this and be prepared to be entertained in the old fashioned way."
4,Good Stuff-Needs an Editor,"Rick makes some excellent and interesting points; his book is worth reading.Unfortunately, he is not a very good writer. Shorter sentences written in the active voice would have made this book a much easier read. In spite of his amateurish writing style, Rick has much to offer.A good editor would have helped...a lot. Spell check can't fix everything (if you are referring to a vast number of people, the word to use is ""horde,"" not ""hoard."").Still, it is worth reading through the jello to get Rick's perspective on leadership."
3,This is not the digital version of the book,"I bought this assuming that this was a digital version of the book, but it is not so. Its a Booz-Allen-Hamilton's take on the central idea of the book. This digital version is 16 pages versus 496 pages of the original book.I complained to Amazon, and they immediately refunded my purchase price. Two cheers to Amazon."
1,"Don't buy this if you want the book, this is NOT THE BOOK","I also bought this thinking it was the book, Amazon needs to do a better job marking this so people will realize this is a short 16 page doc instead of the whole book.Too bad, I would have loved to have gotten the whole book so easily."
1,The Fortune at the bottom of the Pyramid,"This was a textbook, a reference book. This was not what I expected. Difficult to just read. I threw it away!"
5,Mya: Movin' On,Track Listing:1. Movin' On [Radio Edit - ft. Silkk The Shocker] [3:58]2. Movin' On [Fernando's Radio Edit] [3:52]3. Movin' On [Album Version] [4:30]4. University Mix [ft. Raekwon 7 Noreaga] [5:09]
4,She could have done better,I think the video was one of the best of 1998 I like the original version better than the remix. Mya could have done better since it's a sad song she should have put more effort in this song and poured her heart out. Mya can sing really good though.
4,Quite the gorefest!!,"If you like your horror movies slash um up sloppy,gooey, and full tilt bloody, this film is for you! Very slow to start off, but when it gets going it's an all out gore hounds delight. It's also got some very graphic undertones throughout. It's definately not for everyone!!"
4,enjoyable,I really enjoyed this movie. It was cheesy but in a likable way. It had a lot of gore and some humor which worked for the film. If you want a film that's not too deep but different get this.
4,Wrong Turn 2,"I didnt think this was as good as the first movie, but worthwatching. If you can find one used, you might get it to watchbut I dont think I would pay for a new one."
3,Should have made a Left Turn.,I would have given this film a little bit more of a star but I dont want you think that this is anything original. Its not a bad film but its not great. The Film is based around a reality show filming out in the woods where the contestants have to survive a nuclear blast that has left everything in ruins. If you can get past that and the silly cast you will enjoy the rest. After all that are mutunt faimly who I compare to the Hills Have Eyes but for the woods begin to pick off all the players and of course take them back to feed on them. It has some really brutal violence and good effects. If it where not for this I would not have cared for the film. Other than that its not a bad rent but just get through the thin plot and you might enjoy this one.
3,about as good as you could expect,"For what it was worth, I enjoyed the first Wrong Turn. I enjoyed the second half of this one too. The first half is pretty painful though. Bad acting and bad dialogue. A bunch horny twenty year olds out in the woods arguing and screwing. They were so annoying that I found myself rooting for the mutants to butcher them. And speaking of the mutants, the first time around I think we met three. This time we're introduced to the entire charming family tree. Henry Rollins' character was the only one I cared about. The dog-cat-mouse game of him-mutants-cast was pretty entertaining. So overall, more death, more gore. some boobies, and Rollin's roided up pecs. It's worth a rent but I wouldn't pay $20 for it. I've found it goes rather well with whiskey though."
1,Worng Turn Wrong movie,I did not like this movie. I remembered i had watched in on TV already. The acting was bad! The blood shed looked fake.
4,My Favorite After the original,"this is my favorite wrong turn after the original. I like this one probably because I like reality tv. That's the premise of this one and it works, until all end up dead and s*** hits the fan--- where's everyone go?"
3,Characters,"Not as good as the first one, still good though, different, i recently watched Number 4 and think they shouldve used different characters for the Third one"
4,Not as great as the first but still very enjoyable!,"Even though I found the first to be a much better movie, the second installment was still a very enjoyable horror movie. It was even gorier than the first. Th plot was quite different compared to the first and had more depth to it. If you enjoyed the first movie, i would definitely see the sequel. However you must see the first movie first to set the scene for the sequels that follow. It isn't a must but it is definitely a plus considering it starts the series out and so far is the best installment by far. Although it may not be enough gore for some horror fans."
1,IT SUCKS !!!,"The original, I thought, was good. They should have left well enough alone. Part 2 is terrible! Dont waste your money!"
2,truly terrible,"friend of mine threw this at me to view tonight.. this has got to be one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen. even the brief female nudity though nice was not enough to save this train wreck, don't be fooled by the positive reviews. probably written by people who didn't want to be the only ones conned into seeing this. do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. the hills have eyes 2 was better."
1,One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made!!!!,How can this movie be getting this many stars I dont get it! I just rented this stupid piece of s@#$ garbage the other night I had to just fast forward it. Dont waist your money on this film buying it or even renting it the movie just sucks big time. I mean it is right up there with that other stupid sequel Return To House On Haunted hill and Bug too!
1,sigh,"the service from this order was outstanding, i was pretty disappointed in the actual movie tho.lol. was expecting it to be so much more after the first one. oh well cant win them all."
3,case cracked,haven't watched the movie but the case corner is broken. ordered another because i just can't have a broken case.
5,Better! the second time around.......................,"A movie for hardcore gore fans, this movie got everything, graphic death scenes, nudity, torture, mutant birth, mutant sex, and even a mutant pleasers himself while looking at a sunbather. A reality show about the end of the world leaves a bunch of people in the woods, and they are killed off one by one by mutant family. WT2 is a movie that stands on its own, got nothing to do with the first movie. For those who enjoyed the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre both movies, and The Hills Have Eyes 1 & 2 should not pass up Wrong Turn 2!"
3,"Gory, yes, entertaining? Not really.","I'm a bit bored of mutant hillbilly films and Wrong Turn 2 didn't really do it for me. The whole reality TV thing is a bit trite and the character's were more caricatures - maybe that was the filmaker's intention but I don't really care enough to find out. That said, the gore is really well done, and with a decent script this could have been so much better than it was. Also, to be honest, I missed Elisha Dukhu. If she were in it and the innane people were not I may just have liked it more.Great gore (the axe murder at the beginning is really well done and inventive) but couldn't maintain my interest with this one."
3,Rollins Rules!,"Henry Rollins made this otherwise average movie pretty decent. It seems to borrow tricks from another movie I recently saw, Severence. Maybe just a coincidence. There are better movies out there, but this one isn't bad and if you enjoy Rollins and his energetic characters, you will like this movie."
2,"I'm a one-dimensional character, get me out of here!","The chuntering mutant hillbillies are back and this time it's personal! Lynch has produced a respectable gorefest that continues the simple themes of the original. This time, however, a hint of media satire has been thrown in, along with a mean machine ex-marine. Tongue is still in cheek as the grisly deeds are performed with relish. As usual the hapless, stereotypical victims stumble around until their time is up. It's not intellectually challenging, and it's not quite as good as the original, but it is gruesome fun."
4,Not as good as the first,"I loved the first movie. It's one of my favorite horror movies. But this one fell short. The people were killed off way too quickly. Maybe it was because there were so many of them. The person that I wanted to live, died. One second she was alive, the next she wasn't. I did like how they expanded the story of the rednecks though."
5,Excellent audio rendition,"Much anticipated, as evidenced on a website ""The Sherlock Holmes Society"", I was not sure I would like this, having enjoyed the dramatizations by Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce on restored radio productions. Well, David Tomlinson reads Arthur Conan Doyle's story in top form, as if we were hearing Dr. Watson himself tell the story. He does all the voices, and will soon become a favorite audio reader. I completely enjoyed these readings. Plus, since they are the unabridged works, we hear every nuance that ACD wrote into the story, with no embellishment. The stories do hold up after so many years."
4,"Simple, yet not too complex","The book is good due to its simple explanation of napoleons life, although, at times it is not specific enough for the reader to really understand what is going on in the story."
4,Good Read,"A good read with useful tips on how to be not just presentable but charming.From face,hair,fashion to how you should present your best in gatherings, parties etc...would surely recommend this book to my friends!"
2,Not what I expected,Very little of this book applies to today's standards. It's more like a cute little coffee table or gift book. Not really worth buying for yourself.
1,Weak,"Charm? Well, I'm not so sure. A good portion of the books tells you to lose weight (a chart is provided to tell you what you ought to weigh) and to dress appropriately for your height. The tips on charming behavior lack foundation and system. I found it to be too simple,lots of it common sense. I wish I did not buy it."
1,Outdated,The information contained in the book is largely outdated and not very useful. So dry and pedestrian that I did not bother to finish reading it.
1,Do not waste your money,"This book is completely out of date. If you want a book on charm, this is a waste of money. Change your underwear at least every other day? Really? Exercises to lose weight? Toe touches and ""windmills""? Nothing in this book gave me any advice that shouldn't be common sense today. What a waste of time and money!"
1,1930's,"don't be fooled by the modern day apperance of this one, it was published in the thirties. So, that being said it may have been a great guide to charm for my grandmama, but It has little relevency to our modern customs and lifestyles. There was a whole chapter on ""which hat to select to go with what frock"" I don't think I've ever even worn a frock. there were som e useful parts but I'd keep looking if i were serioulsy looking for a book on etiquitte and charm."
3,Cute.. but dated,"I was tempted to buy this book on-line, but I didn't. Luckily during one of my tromps through a second hand store, I found it for 2 bucks. Hey, I can spend two bucks on a book I'm not sure about.Its a cute book, some of the advice is severely dated, but hey, I like antique books about personal care (I am a proud owner of the ""Ford Guide to Model Beauty""- and that is a classic!)"
5,A Perfect Book of Beauty,"I think this book benefits already fashionable and charming people, rather than people who are in dire need of fashion or charm techniques. This book puts common sense and style together, which magazines and designers have yet figured out to do. I try to read the book every season, before shopping, in order to wash out all the nonsensical things magazines and designers like to tell you. Like 800 ways to make a Man Look at You!! OR Clothes, that make you stop Eating!!This book makes you take a step back and re-evaluate your style choices. The best fashion book. Test of Time."
5,Timeless,"My Mom loaned this book from our local library and made me read it when she was finished. Then I finished it, cover to cover, in only 2 days. I loved it so much that I rushed to Amazon to find a copy to keep for myself. This book was written in the 1930's and contains language and customs from that time that, while not completely up-to-date, are fun to read about. However, the over-all message, the advice, warnings, blunt suggestions, rules, stories and many jokes are still very relevant to today's world! This is a book that proves no matter what else, a woman's charm is timeless and she can conquor the world with it. It is a nice reminder of the manners and attitudes it would be nice for everyone to have! This would make a perfect gift for any close female, especailly one who may need a lesson or two in charm!! It is a must read ladies!!!"
1,Better Thank Beauty,The information in this book is outdated and useless. Some of the suggestions are down right laughable in this age.
1,Advice from my grandmother.,"When I first picked up this book, I was expecting a book for the modern girl. Instead, I was reading advice on buying toiletries from a ""druggist"" (I assume it's a pharmacist by today's vocabulary), and how to wear a dress with a matching hat.This book is very outdated for the today's modern woman. However, if you are looking for advice on how to become your grandmother when she was a teenager, this is your book.The synopsis on the back of the book is very misleading..."
3,Re Glib and Insulting,This book was first published in 1938!!!!!!! The fact that it contains some outdated notions about body image and fashion should come as no surprise.
2,Better than Beauty,It contains pretty much the same information in other beauty books out there. Not impressive.
2,boring,"The book was OK...but, it didn't keep me reading (I had to struggle to finish it) It was seemed like it was just taken from an OLD book & not really for today's readers. I was hoping for something MORE & this just wasn't it."
1,another skipper in the saga of the pretty books,French ? Pretty ? A Guide to Charm ? this should be banned or a steep import tariff placed on it for poor content .. then it should be placed in a dustbin far away from a decent readers' home for fear of contamination. this one was bad as far as content and worthless as a present as originally intended .. there it sits getting dusty on the shelf. perhaps I can donate it somewhere but it does seems unkind to have anyone else suffer through this book and actually apply any of the drivel within its covers to their lives. a bad book with equally bad guidance.
5,Great find,"I loved this book. As some of the other reviewers noted, there is a bit of non-applicable information in the first portion (making sure the seams on your nylons are straight, etc.). However, I found most of the advice to be timeless and a much-needed reminder of true etiquette."
5,Timeless ....,"I was a tad worried at first that this book may be a guide on how to be perfect to some ones ""standards"" , but I was very delighted that that wasn't the case at all . This book teaches you the timeless basics so that you can be your self in its truest form and shine ."
3,"Interesting, occasionally useful, but mistitled","The first half of the book is actually a totally different book, which should have been printed separately as ""How Not To Offend People With Your Odor."" I skipped most of it. As it's a thin book already, half of it being irrelevant is rather a lot.The section that is actually on charm is pretty good, but very, very basic. They do give rather refreshing advice like, ""read a lot of different news publications to stay informed,"" but there's also plenty of, ""try to remember your conversational partner has feelings too."" Thanks, I already know that, I was looking for some slightly more advanced techniques. Overall, I'm glad I read it at the library, but would have been mad if I'd spent money on it."
2,Not what I expected,"I might not have understood the description of the book, but the title was misleading. I was looking for something that was more about manners and charm and this was more about attire and make up. I don't think it is a bad book just not what the title implied."
3,"Interesting read, but some information is very obvious","The book was an interesting read just because of its language, some old-fashioned words and expressions. I found the information in the first part of the book very obvious. Unless someone lives in a forest and has never interacted with people, one would know how often hair is supposed to be washed or teeth cleaned. I think this is the kind of information that children learn when they are five years old, may be even earlier. The second part of the book is more interesting. I felt that some information is still very common sense, for example, not to expect a very fast service at a restaurant if you notice that the waiters are really busy. There are some pointers that are nice to be reminded of. It all boils down to the idea that if you are a genuine, sincere person who cares for others' interests and feelings, you will be perceived as a charming individual."
2,Oldie but not quite a goodie,"Don't overlook the fact that this is a reprint of a book on etiquette and personal grooming from the 1930s and it reads exactly as that. The info seemed outdated in terms of what is considered proper ettiquette these days and also in terms of a woman's role in society. Perhaps some of the most basic facts of etiquette from this book still apply, but I don't think anyone raised with even a modicum of manners will learn anything new. Look for a newer reference and one with specifics if you really want a book on etiquette."
4,Dated but still relevant,"This book is from the late 1930s, but the information in it is still relevant in society today. The first portion of the book can be skipped or read for the amusing information on buying matching gloves and exercising. The second half of the book is a timeless guide to being polite, interesting, and charming. I wish I had read this when I was twelve as it's full of easy tips for being gracious even to others who are less than polite. I believe I'll be re-reading this for years until I'm able to fully integrate the advice into my personality."
2,VHS Tape,This movie was a favorite of mine... But the quality was very poor... adjusting the tracking on my NEW VCR did not improve the picture... It was difficult to watch. :(
5,Cristian Songs,This cd is the best ever i love this cd this inspired me to get closer with the lord I like the Rap in this music the christian rap is the best engoy this cd this cd has a trong point in it
4,Cute,"I like the new setting in the mountains for this ""alternate"" ""indie"" :-) railroad for the narrow gauge engines! it's fun and well made altough my toddler misses more appearances of the traditional engines."
2,Did not fit as promised,The service engine soon light came on and stayed on because of this. While the site said it would fit...it did not. The quality is great and I wish it would have worked because it would have been a wonderful deal.
5,beautiful and well made.,"The quality is like a piece of sculpture, and we've gotten a number of comments from visitors when they've encountered our new door handles. They are smooth and elegant and look like they will last a very long time. The rubbed bronze finish is a rich brown color that goes well with any decor. Signature Hardware was very quick to ship and followed up on the order to make sure everything was in order."
1,Stay Away From This!!!!!,"This should go straight to the garbage. They should have a rating of ""0"" for this piece of junk."
2,disappointing,"Sadly, the best thing about this novel is it's lovely cover. Other than that, the book fell flat. While Grabien is facile with words, the plot was predictable and quite. As a folk music lover, I thought that I would adore the book, but the book merely dragged."
3,Who talks like that??,"The story was entertaining, even a bit creepy, but the dialogue was so stilted! I cringed nearly every page! Maybe Deborah Grabien learned that conversational style growing up; if so, she should have been saying, knock it off! Otherwise, a light, easy read. Maybe as she writes more, the dialogue will improve."
4,Charming and spooky,"I picked this one up at the library. It was spooky and charming. I guess I scare easily, because there were parts that I waited to read during the daytime, instead of before bedtime. I couldn't be as brave as those 3, seeing ghosts all over the place. I don't ever want to see a ghost, thank you very much.I think I am going to have to get the next one in this series. I just wish it came with a CD, so that I could hear what these songs sound like. I am assuming they are actual songs, right?"
4,"A fireside story, not a mystery","This is a lovely little book, one which Publisher's Weekly finds understandably difficult to characterize. It's rather outside of conventional genres, but that doesn't mean you should avoid it! Instead, you should snuggle in with your favorite blanket and a nice cup of tea, and let Ms. Grabien tell you a story. Her ability to capture mood is tremendous - you can almost feel the ghosts yourself! I got chills, even reading it in my office. Her spare yet descriptive style reminds me very much of Peter S. Beagle, and the British characters sound so real they made me homesick for England.While I liked Weaver a lot, I don't give it 5 stars. I'm sure that as Ms. Grabien becomes more comfortable with Ringan and Penny and their world, later books in this series will get 5 stars from me! I hope we get to spend more time with Liam, Jane, and Matty; Wychsale and Butterball; and that maybe someday BBC Mystery will have a Ringan and Penny series."
2,nothing to write home about,"Expansion is enjoyable enough, but I was surprised at how much the lack of ability to customize Native American home cities detracted from my enjoyment. Also I'm pretty sure actual Native Americans should be fairly upset about this game, especially the campaign."
4,I like it.,"I like this game. Is not too complicated but it make you think. I know some people do not like it, but for me is fun."
3,"Decent, but not great","Well, like I said, it is decent, but not great, so I give it an average score of 3."
2,Poor expansion,"I found the expansion pretty lacking overall, it didn't mesh well with the original game. I honestly stopped playing it after I got this expansion."
5,Everything in moderation? not in this case,"This deserves the expansion of the year award... i dont believe there is such a thing as too much fun... in this case it may be true; three new civs, new units, more to do in home cities, more cards, and a whole new campaign! i will admit the natives are lacking in some areas such as construction but other than that this was a great buy, its worth the money and anyone who disagrees is seriously confused. i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any AOE especially AOE3, it basically completes the game and it really brings some closure to the live of the blackssincerely,tony"
4,new warchief,"the age of empire 3 the warchief comes with 3 entire new civilization which allows player to have a more variety of stragegy. but when the computer uses the native, they suck so bad is like they are not even trying. overall the warchief brings new unit, building, mode for all civilizations. it will worth your money, but don't expected too much, especially from the natives."
1,lake place games,"Lake place games customer service is extremely rude to the point of being severely abusive to their customers! I would never order again on principle! If you have a problem, they will humiliate, berate and abuse you! Find another company, but never order from Lake Place Games - you will regret it!!!!"
3,Trouble staying on the walls,"Unlike most of the reviews here, I was a little disappointed with this product. We used these wall stickers to help transform our Thomas-loving son's room from baby room to big boy room after he finished potty training. I had trouble getting many of these stickers to stick to the walls right from the start. Some wouldn't stick at all and most of the rest have started slowly peeling off or needed reinforcement with some double stick tape. I'm not sure if that is a problem with newly painted walls or what the issue is."
4,nice,it came fast and its just as i thought it would be. my son was so excited to see them and couldnt wait to have them on his walls. they look great
5,great price! good quality,"My son loves ""tommy train"". I purchased this to go in his room along the railing. They are really nice quality."
5,Great!,The stickers are now all over my son's bedroom. He reads the names of the train every night before he goes to sleep. Good quality too!
5,love it,"Shipping was fast, price was great. Makes the room come to life, they stick on the wall and dont peel off they completed the thomas the engine look in our lil boys room very very happy with the purchase, wise they would of included more trees other than that it is perfect."
5,"great bribe, uh treat","We bought these as a ""treat"" (bribe) to motivate our stubborn 3 1/2 year old to use the potty. After only a weekend, we have a potty trained kid and a wall full of stickers. They are easy for him to position and move and are very sturdy. I'm off to buy ""Cars"" and ""Spiderman"" stickers for reinforcement."
2,PUT A FORK IN THIS SHOW,Very disappointing and growing old and tired. The charecters on this series have not grown since season one and I am growing tired of their child like antics. Any female watching this show should take great insult at being protrayed as nothing more then sexual servants to these idiots.not likely to waste my time on season five.
5,Medellín,"Great season, again twisting the plot and story versus the previous ones. This alone makes it a new ride in of itself. The opening episode, a-la Hearts Of Darkness documentary on Apocalypse Now, is funny and a mood-setter for the season.As a native Colombian, I did feel disappointed that Entourage also failed to depict Colombia properly. Seems like they followed the stereotype of the small town-village setting (that we do have, but in the rural areas) to make it seem as if the entire country is so underdeveloped. Because of the satirical and comic nature of Entourage, I let it pass. Just a thought."
4,Show slows down a bit this season,"4.2 starsDidn't dig this one nearly as much as season three, mainly because there wasn't enough of Dillon and Piven, my reasons for watching the show. Vince and Eric are pleasant enough, but really not that funny. And I watch this show to laugh, so the Medellin story line gets a little old due to its semi-seriousness. I also got more than a bit tired of the Walsh character, who might be accurate as a type but really isn't very funny and grates pretty hard after a while.Nonetheless, the writing is still strong and there are enough solid laughs to make it worth watching."
5,entourage season 4,i love this show...if you havent watched this season you will love it i promise...best show on tv
2,The most disappointing release of the year.,"Virtuoso caught my ear on his 12-inch single ""Incinerator"", which was extremely dope. He has a unique, unquestionably dope delivery and spits a lot of good lines. After I heard ""Incincerator"", ""Orion's Belt"" and his appearances on 7L & Esoteric's tracks I wanted to hear more from him. Somebody told me he had released an EP, and I later found a copy of it. But when I heard it, the dire truth hit me. On this EP Virtuoso tries to do his own version of ""Hard Knock Life"" and it sounds terrible to hear him spit over jiggified, Swizz Beats-like production. This was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever heard. I do hope he never repeats this mistake. Shame on you, Virtuoso!"
1,wrong year,"this is listed to fit a 1961 cadillac ,however the 61 had 1960 model suspension pARTS HALF THAT PRODUCTION YR.NOT THE SAME PART . 1 IS THREADED THE OTHER IS A PRESS FIT SHAFT.MONEY LOST"
2,sliding door handle,"These handles were nice but the first set I received was scratched (telling me these are PAINTED pewter) and the face plates were actually nickel not pewter so they didnt match. The screws included in the set are not the right size. I called the company and the man I spoke to was very apologetic, polite and sent out another set overnight. I did receive the second set as promised but it was the exact same problem. Screws too small and a blend of pewter/nickel parts. I would have rated higher for good service but the product truly was of quality. Time was an issue in this situation for me so I had to run down to Lowe's and buy new screws. Then when assembling I find out the handles do not sit tight/flush to the sliding door. They are not secure.... wobbly because internal hardware sticks out past the faceplate preventing it from sitting flat on the door."
2,So So,I had previously had a set of these in my Altima. They were a nice bright WHITE light. These are named extreme but are nothing more then bright yellowish lights...Guess i'm going to have to go with HIDs to get the look I want. I had silverstar bulbs and these are no better.
3,PIAA fog lights,Result was not that great as expected. Claiming that product is really a big improvement over OEM fog lights. Slight improvement only. Wish they could have at least have a rating between OEM vs. product being purchased.
5,Moose you better run even Faster,"Got them and put them in, looks great, works great, and now I can see everything that gets in my way....."
1,don't waste your money,"1) Not much better then the stock bulb, hard to tell it is ""extreme white""2) PIAA warrants all halogen bulbs for a period of 1 year, bulb failed after 1 1/2 years"
3,Slight brightness,"Just got this today and installed it after work in my 08 Impreza Outback. In daylight, there is no difference with the stock halogens I had. But in a darkened setting you can see only a SMALL difference but at least there is a difference. It's NOT extreme white though. L.E.D bulbs are probably way better. But it does its job of a small upgrade from stock halogens, so a 3 is sufficient."
2,Caution this is NOT Xtreme White,I bought it because I thought PIAA is a famous brand. But returned the item right away after finding out that it is no way close to Xtreme White. It says 4000K but but I think it is close to 3600K. Not only that it wasn't powerful enough as well.H11 is very unique fitting and it is hard to find in local dealers because only few vehicles use it. Like my 2006 4Runner. So you dont have much options. But recently all the big brands have released this fitting which can be easily found on internet (after a few searches).Finally I bought H11 NOKYA 4500K with high watt output. I am really happy with it.
5,I'm JD Tynan's newest fan!,"My wife handed me this book and told me I had to read it because she knows the author. I read the back and thought, ""Chick book""! But I was wrong, it was great! I was stunned that it kept my attention. I'm a police officer and it didn't turn me off the way most fiction does. It was fast-paced, interesting and very cool. I will read JD Tynan again even without my wife forcing me!"
4,Fun read!,"This was a fun read with interesting and humorous characters. A light-hearted look at the workings of the FBI and meteorologists everywhere. The end was very suspensful, I coulnd't put it down!"
4,Recon tailgate light bar,light is great . Had to adjust it 3 times only because the bottom of the tailgate hits it so i put it wright on top of the bumper and now it doesnt hit it . you can not put it wright in the middle . im lucdky i went slow when i put the tailgate down or i would of broke it twice .
2,Not impressed with the Quality of this item.,"I installed this on my older Dodge pickup truck.I bought a chassis wiring kit thru NAPA which made the install pretty much a breeze.This thing worked OK for a few weeks, but then lights started 'dropping out' and wouldn't light.It will be way too much trouble to remove this thing for any warranty replacement so I will live with it until it completely dies.When it is dead it will not be replaced!Save your money on this product ~ it is too much hassle and it does not last."
4,Happy buyer,"Fabulous!! Book came quickly and was in great condition. Great book for kids. Very durable, hard to tear and even water resistant cover."
4,Only if scientific information was more,the program is a bit short and doesn't contain much scientific data as I expected. It mainly tells the story of discoverying the gamma ray bursts and their true origin. But still it worths the price.
3,read the formulas on the black board,"The mystery of gamma ray busters has been around a long time.The one side said it was neutron stars and the other that it was ""cosmic events"".There are two kinds of stellar collapse:one ends in a neutron star core and the other in a black hole.The larger stars end as black holes.I can't give this staging a good review as the formulas behind one professor on the black board were completely unrelated to astrophysics.This kind of TV show is made to drum up money for big projects,but glosses over the science.For instance,it wasn't mentioned that the black holes at the center of spiral galaxies like ours would have given off gamma ray bursts, so that galaxy formationsand their types may be connected to gamma ray bursts.As there seem to be definite quantum categories of black holes by the size or mass of the original collapsing star, they would have different gamma ray profiles which also wasn't mentioned."
2,Too big and rips clothes,"I love geckos and thought the ring was awesome so I got it and found that the ring was very big. I ordered a size too small on purpose so I could put it on my pinkie but it's on my thumb because it is huge! Also the ring rips your clothing, bags, or blankets. The feet get caught on the fabric and rip it. I eventually had to completely stop wearing it because it was causing me so many problems."
3,THE LOVE OF GECKOS,"THE RING WAS AN INTERESTING PURCHASE, IT WAS THINNER THAN I HAD THOUGHT, AGAIN , I WISH AMAZON WOULD USE US MEASUREMENTS INSTEAD OF METRIC. THE RING ARRIVED IN GREAT TIME AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. I WOULD PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
5,Love this ring!!,This is a really pretty ring!! If you are a gecko fan this ring is a must! I get compliments from people everywhere I go:) The gecko lays very flat on your finger so you won't get it stuck on things. If they make more rings like this with different reptiles I would buy those too:)
2,Lacking,"Steppelords of Mars grants about 11 pages to detail the Steppe Martians of Nepenethes-Thoth, enough detail for rounding out NPC's and PC's. The rest degrades into a stilted adventure that needs a lot of tweaking to appeal to modern-day role-players. Still it has it moments.Caravans of Mars is similar, giving some detailed information on the Eastern desert of the Aetheri/Elysium wastes and introduces several NPC's and the Shaman profession (about 4 1/2 , 4 & 4 pages respectively). The rest is an adventure with the characters travelling by caravan across the Eastern Desert. As with the other adventure, the adventure runs on rails and needs tweaking to make it more enjoyable. One of the best encounters is with Martian bush monkeys - they are cute & funny, but dangerous."
3,Beware!! Misleading Description!,"PIAA bulbs are awesome, for what they put out, they last about a year, beating the rest of the cheap wanna be White Plus bulbs sold at Advance Auto or AutoZone. PIAA's are the best you can get.The reason there's a 3 star rating was because I was under the impression I was getting TWO bulbs...you know, a PAIR, DEUCE...2. No...these people sell it to you as EACH. And nowhere in there is a description about this except for a photo showing 1..charging the same price for 1 bulb compared to what you can find elsewhere at the same price for TWO bulbs. So I rest my case with that argument."
2,"Not the ""xtreme"" white that I expected",I purchased the product expecting the light to be close to HID brightness but unfortunately these bulbs still look like standard halogens when compared to an HID bulb. I probably would go with Silver Stars by Sylvania if I have the chance again since they are just as bright and half the price.
5,Necessary reading for anyone serious about growing in their spiritual life,Dr. Muto brings over 40 years of personal research and teaching and is dean of the Epiphany Academy of Formative Spirituality. The institute's credentials are approved by the Roman Catholic Church and yet retains great respect across ecumenical circles. John of the Cross for Today: The Ascent makes the brilliant counsels of St. John of the Cross accessible to lay audiences without diminishing St. John's original thought and intent. A must read for anyone desiring to plumb the depths of the spiritual life.
2,meh... ok. but VERY low budget,"This movie had the potential to be somewhat funny, but it was so poorly filmed and produced, that it lost almost all comedic moments. Other than the one farting scene. Thats always going to be funny. Otherwise, the story line was pretty flat and the character flaws of the two female friends were actually quite serious problems. Not funny. It seemed like it would have been much better had it been made with the budget reqired for a modern funny movie.One really great thing was to see a woman in a lead role who looks absolutely average. Big applause for that! And she was great. Again, had the film been given what it deserved, she would have been really something. Oh well. Maybe she will get something better next time."
1,don`t buy it,it sucksthe batery runs out quickly.no flash.the camera decides when it wants to take a picture not you.sometimes it`s own software doesn`t recognice it.and wipes your taken photos when the software doesn`t find the camera.it sucks.[...]piece of trash.it doesn`t accept some bateries.
3,Argus DC1512 2.1MP Digital Camera,"I bought this camera with the idea that I could use it for online sales. It worked fine for Items 5 feet away but any length short of that was blurry. The webcam feature workedwell and portraits work well also. No flash made nightime pictures difficult at best.The price I paid was fantasticbecause had I paid msrp, I would have been dissapointed."
1,Bad Camera,I got this camera from my uncle like 3 years ago. I was so excited when I got it but it doesn't really work. The batteries run out really quick and it's really hard to put them on to the computer. There's no flash so I couldn't take nighttime pictures. The pictures come out blurry and overall it's worth the price because it barely functions... I wouldn't buy it!
3,a great buy!,"For the price this is a great little introduction to digital photography. I bought one as a ""throwaway"" but am keeping it in my car for times when I forget to take a camera with me. It's not for pros, but it does take good, clear pictures. Nothing fancy, but you can't beat the price!"
1,Misleading customers should be penalized,"It says sold by Target and by Amazon. this one misleads customers, shows another model that has an lcd display on the back, and the one sold does not. It says 2.1 MegaPixels and the one you received it's 0.1. This camera is for a kid(not more than 5 years old). It's a piece of crap! So disapointed with this buy. On the packing it doesn't says 2.1 MP, so I wonder were this info came from. A cellphone has better resolution than this junk.Don't be mislead, I recommend don't buy this product, you'll throw away your money."
1,driver nightmare,"Argus DC 1512 drivers are only available with other software which includes toolbars malware and stuff which has not been requested,Companies who download crap should be avoided and run out of town. DC1512 is in my experience not worth installing since it will by neccessity involve doubtful practice sooner or later. It did come with a CD which was okay for a while, but software houses who partner shady operators should be shown the red card by everybody."
2,Disappointing way to go out,"Warnings: Copy-protected, explicit lyrics. This was the Markets' last album before they went on hiatus in 2006. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree more with the first two reviewers. While I really liked Digidogheadlock and Osc-Dis (haven't listened to 010 yet), this was a massive disappointment, not to mention it wouldn't play in anything in my house (a byproduct of the copy-protection which almost always accompanies Japanese CDs nowadays). There was far too much screaming, even moreso than other MCM albums. Oddly, one of the quietest songs (She Loves It/Explore the New Day) is on this otherwise loud album. Let It Rip is a remix of the song of the same name from the Japanese ""psytrance"" group Joujouka (they're not psytrance, they're not even close to psytrance, they're not even trance! But enough about Joujouka. You can read my reviews of their products when I post them). Only a few good songs here. What a disappointment."
2,Time has passed it by,"In the four years since this book was published, beading as a craft and art has made huge leaps forward. The speed of advancing talent is pushed by avid dedication of beaders and advances in bead technology (the uniformity of delicas and the variety of finishes and colors, for example.) Leaps like these left this book behind. This is a simple book that helps beaders achieve simple projects. There is almost a naive, ""let's get married on the front porch"" appeal to the beadwork.If today's bride is a beader, she wants to showcase her talents with impressive pieces. The bride who is not a beader will pass over these projects as not being elegant enough for a wedding day.Beginning beaders might want to try beading on memory wire or stringing fresh water pearls, both are projects in this book. But there are other beginning books that provide more information and a better foundation."
1,very disappointing,"I just bought this book and I find it totally useless. The beading is just stringing on one line, nothing more. For bridal patterns I was expecting a lot more!"
2,Not What I'd Expected,"When I ordered this book, I was hoping it would have lots of pictures. It has about 4 pages of color photos. The rest of the book is instructions on making the items shown on the color pages. While the items shown are lovely, this book was disappointing for me since it didn't deliver what I'd hoped it would."
4,A fun book to read,"After doing my own smaller version of touring through Italy, its fun to read about another person's adventures. I'm reading it and knowing exactly what he is talking about. Its a really fun read."
5,Romance between a Guy on a Vespa and Italy,"Absolutely charming. Mr. Moore has technical tribulations with the ancient Vespa he purchases, but that only adds to the story of how he falls in love with Northern Italy. Go to his website disclosed at the back of the book for the extra photos he took. If I ever get to Chianti, I will buy a modern Vespa and travel the same route."
3,"not bad , not Greenberg","I bought it with high expectations believing that it would be as great as Greenberg.What a disappointment!It has 200 pages in the beginning totally useless, it has very few figures and it could have been more tightly written in fewer pages.The 3 stars go because it covers most of the neurosurgical procedures by providing the basic steps of them.With a little more work a good second edition is possible."
1,Lousy book,This book is neither detail enough to be used as a revision book nor small enough to be used daily. A big waste of time and money! Don't ever buy it.
4,"Very enjoyable, but realistic??? Not sure.","A pleasure to read this book about Amy, a high-schooler who blows it with guys over and over by forgetting to just be herself (mainly in quest of a prom date), but I don't believe this character could really exist to this extreme. Still, it's a nice wholesome account of a loving family, kind friends & a sweet teen who loves literature & knowledge & seems to know or care nothing about sex, drugs & rock and roll. A rose-colored-glasses look at high school in the affluent 'burbs in the early 80s. Fun & sweet."
1,"Doesn't look like the catalog picture, or even a Yorkie","I ordered this Yorkie for my 12-year-old for Valentine's day who is a Yorkie fan but has no real Yorkie of his own. Based upon the catalog image and description it looked like a sure thing.Unfortunately, what we got instead looks like a cheap imitation. Our primary gripe is that the hair on our product is far shorter than that shown in the catalog image, resulting in hair that, especially for the face, is too short to brush into any shape resembling a Yorkie. Instead, the hair is frizzy and stands straight out on the entire body. The head shape is wrong for a Yorkie too, looking more like a schnauzer. I feel like I've been taken."
1,Not as Pictured,"While the photo online is rather cute, the item I received bears no resemblance whatsoever. The hair is coarse, matted and short. No amount of brushing would make the toy I received look like the one pictured. It's going back today. Should be at Amazon's expense (poor QC)...but that's not how they work."
4,"Looking for ""Toto""","We were looking for a ""Toto"" to go with our granddaughter's ""Dorothy"" costume and found this little dog on line. Our granddaughter is happy with him so we are too!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"This is the UGLEST STUFFED ANIMAL I have Ever seen!!!! If it was not promised to a 6 year old that ripped of the tags I would WANT MY MONEY BACK!! YUCK it is so horrible, and DOES NOT LOOK like the picture!!! I WILL NEVER Purchase another item from this brand!!!!"
1,Scary looking yorkie.,"If the real breed looked like this, they would not be a popular breed. I gave this to my toddler niece for Christmas In hopes that she would learn that my dogs are fun, and get used to petting and playing with a fake one first. Yeah, that backfired miserably. It looked nothing like a dog, let alone a yorkie. She opened the box and started crying and screaming NO NO NO NO!! At least now she thinks my dog is the friendly and cute one. What a disappointment. Oh! It's also super stiff with sticks in the legs. And looks NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!Cheers."
5,So wildly Different!,"I don't get into poetry much, but her music is so WOW! Listen to her voice, it is very melodic and soothing at the same time.Her songs are very advanced. I have to listen to them more than once to get a real grasp of what she wants to say, but it is well worth it!She has turned me on to her music. Very cool!"
1,Dining Out Companion,I never received the book but I was charged for it. Hard to review a book I've never looked at. Forced to rate it above but probably would have given it a lot more stars if I could have used it.
2,Most questions are too obscure.,"I bought this game to play at a gathering of couples who are all kids of the 70's. What I thought was going to be a fun trip down memory lane, ended up being a bunch of questions for which no one knew the answers. Needless to say, I don't recommend this product."
5,Very Informative and Fun!!!!,"I loved it!! The game could be used in more than one fun way, either as a trivia by itself or with the gameboard and dice."
5,Brought us back!,"What a great game! I bought this game for a 70's themed party and played it with a group...more like a drinking game... and it was groovy! Some of the questions were pretty obscure, but overall I highly recommed it!"
1,Disapointing,"Sub Par...Poor Selection of material, Poor recording quality...quantity of material dosen't make up for quality. It is just NOT up to the standards you would expect from s Great artist as Tony Bennett."
3,Wavy lines and major ghosting,"Worked great for a while, now it has all kinds of wavy lines and major ghosting. Wouldn't really recommend it unless it was a great price."
2,I think viewsonic lied about its dot pitch.,"I can clearly see the individual phosphors(dots) on this monitor. I am sending it back immediately, the lower priced G810 has less of a grainy look to it. The text is sharp, the colors are good, but even at 30"" from the screen I can still see the matrix of the phosphors. This is hardly noticable in solid colors, but when looking at buttons that have a color gradient to look rounded, like in windows media player, I can clearly see the matrix (which is independent of resolution).This monitor gets the thumbs down. I broke my own rule of 'never buy a monitor without seeing it first', and now I am gonna pay!"
1,"Lousy Warranty Service, Beware!","Beware of Viewsonic Customer Service. I sent a LCD in for warranty repair, so far it's been 7 weeks with no repair/replacement in sight. Check out Planar LCD's if warranty service is important to you"
5,Very happy with this monitor!,"I'm quite picky when it comes to buying elections (especially computer components). I did a lot of research and it kept leading back to this monitor. Perfectly flat screen, .25mm dot pitch across the entire screen, fast refresh rates at high resolutions, not to mention it's a shadow mask monitor so none of those pesky lines at the top and bottom of the screen that apperture grille monitors have. I upgraded from a generic 17"" monitor I had been using for about 5 years so purchasing this monitor made a huge difference in games (very immersive). After seeing and using the monitor, I would easily recommend it to anyone. It's Sony-level performance without the Sony price. ...!"
3,Shadow mask is noticeable around edge of screen,"My only complaint regarding this monitor is that the when viewed closer than 3ft or so, the shadow mask is particularly noticeable around the edge screen giving the image a pixilated look. In the middle of the screen the image is exceptionally sharp and bright. I'm trying to decide now if this is something I can get used to or if I'll look to find a replacement for this monitor. Other than this issue I'm very happy with the monitor."
4,almost perfect,"Had this for about two years.Only problem i have is there is a little curve in the top of picture if looking down, but if you look straight in middle you cant see it. Did every ajustment to fix it i could not. PUT IN A MOVIE IT LOOKS GREAT.CRISP, CLEAR This one looks better than anything i viewed at a the local stores Im happy with it."
2,Not my cup of tea!,"I was disappointed in the CD.... the music was nice... but not really sounding like reggae! More just like reggae singers, singing christmas songs.... gave it away as a door prize at the party!"
2,Disappointment,Guess I was expecting much more than this CD offered. I now have to be more selective about the recommendations from Amazon.
4,Twilight of a Blues Giant,"I love Jimmy Reed. The man could not produce a single note that is not pure blues. This CD catches Reed at the twilight of his career - early 1970's. The music is basically the same as the standard Reed - slow to medium tempo blues, with the same shrieking harmonica and ""lazy"" voice. The difference is that the band includes some funky ""James Brown"" elements, and that Reed does sound older and slower. The blues is powerful and personal. I recommend it to anyone who loves Jimmy Reed and already owns a CD of his earlier songs."
2,Software limitations,"Product appearance is toy like. Software is not compatible to Windows 7, and no upgrades to Window 7 software is available. No website is available to seek upgrade. Made in China."" Waterproof case developed condensation and made taking pictures difficult under water. I recommend just purchasing a disposable aqua camera for $10.00 from Walgreens. Camera directions are difficult to understand. Where can I find a software upgrade?? I am stuck with a camera I can not use."
3,1.3 MP Waterproof 3 in 1 Underwater Digital Camera,"This product was not what I expected. I stated that it had an LCD screen on it for viewing and the LCD screen is the mode screen so you cannot see the pictures that you have taken until you plug it into your computer. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was very disappointed because he said that it was just like his old camera, the one that does not show his pictures."
3,"Great big band and swing numbers, but muddy sound quality...","Glenn Miller was one of the best of the 1930's big band leaders, and this collection has original pre-WW II material transferred to CD. The songs are fine, but the recording quality is not great. There are probably a few other Miller collections which sound crisper than this one. For a better listening experience, although without Glenn himself, try Ray Anthony's ""In a Miller Mood."" Different songs on that one, but Mr. Anthony played with Glenn, and knows his sound and arrangements."
2,"Cute concept, awful writing!","My daughter (4) absolutely loves this book and has since she was 2 - it has colorful illustrations and is great for any child who loves pictures of the ocean/sea creatures. The plot of a little whale getting lost and asking various sea creatures for help finding his family is adorable. That said, I don't like this book much because the text is so painfully BAD - awkward and horrible rhyming, poor cadence, truly not fun to read aloud. I can't believe anyone would publish such awful writing!Also, the front pouch has never worked quite right. I'm glad we got this as a gift so I didn't spend my own money on it.I'm giving it two stars because kids will like it, the pictures are cute, and other than the pouch the book is very sturdy. The text is just grating though."
3,"Nice feel, but","When you bend your toes, it leaves a mark on the she as if it was made of plastic. Comes out with a shoe-shine but not as good as new."
4,New Shoes,The shoes turned up within a week and a half of ordering and were exactly as expected. They fit like a glove. A little squeaky at the moment but hopefully that will go as the shoes are worn in
1,"Will not buy Florsheim again. Shoes Squeak, made in India!","Let me say that I have been buying Florsheim for about 15-20 years. I noticed when I got this pair that they were made in India. Soon after wearing them, they started to squeak. Imagine how stupid a man dressed in a suit looks walking down the hallway with squeaking shoes. If you want to be that man, go ahead and buy these crappy shoes as for me as for me, they lost a loyal customer as I will never buy Florsheim again!"
1,Stylish but Painful Beginning,"Very stylish shoe. Very shiny. A bit narrower than I imagined, but I have a narrow foot so they fit great. They're real stiff at first, so I now have blisters just under my outer ankle bone on both feet; I walk about a mile a day though. I expect them to soften, form around my foot, and feel real nice in a couple weeks. If they do, I'll move them up to 4 stars..Update (5/30/11): Took very long to break in. The top of the heel area, where your foot enters the shoe, also became worn; The thin leather started peeling off.. I'll pass on these next time around."
4,dress shoes,"These shoes are for my husband, who is well pleased with them. They are good quality for the price and very dressy and attractive. The shoe is a little stiff and slow to break in, but become quite comfortable after a few wearings. They hold a shine well."
1,How A Shy Guy Like Me Earned A Million Dollars In Network Ma,"This book was awful. All Mr. Brown talks about is his particular company and how he was successful stealing other companies employees. He did not give any suggestions for how to approach a typical cold or warm market. After awhile this approach did not work for his downline either. I am returning this book after reading the first 100 pages. It is not well written, appears to be unedited and reads like someone's diary. He goes on for several pages with copies of memos he wrote to his downline about company changes in policy or procedures. Don't buy it, it's not worth your time or money. (The only ones giving this good reviews are his friends!)"
5,This curbs my hunger and it tastes great! So far without much effort I've lost 5 lbs,"Looking for something to help me lose weight and affordable was almost impossible. I found this at a local store and tried it. I was surprised at the taste. Normally things like this have that ever-lasting bitter after taste and only pretended to be chocolate. This tastes good and is chocolatey. I use a hand-held blender, a Toastmaster, that works great with this. I haven't really been following a program, just use this for breakfast and I have lost 5 lbs in about 3 weeks. I am sure if added a little exercise and cut out a few of the higher sugar/calorie things I eat, the weight loss would have been more dramatic. This is satisfying and I find I am not hungry until it is time for the next meal. Plus I have problems feeling nauseous and this helps settle that feeling."
1,No noticable effect,"One reason I purchased this product was the claim that you could make a ""pudding"" for a weight loss snack and it was cheaper than most others. I could NEVER make this work, it always came out soup! I also took as a shake, but the taste is below average and I didn't notice any appetite surpression. There are better products out there. My suggestion is NOT to buy this product."
4,Good but,I must say this tastes great the only problem I had was that even after I had mixed it all up whether it was in the blender or the blender bottle it still tasted grainy. If it wasn't for that I would have given it 5 stars. I like it but I will have to try another product that is not so grainy after.
2,Need Flavor in New Orleans,"I tried this product for the PGX. It has no flavor. I've tried mixing into water, blending with water and ice and even a fat free milk. Its too thick to let sit for any period of time but the main thing is it really has no flavor. It does have lots of fiber so it must be followed by regular water in large quantities. The capsule blend was a better choice for me."
2,good product. i couldn't tolerate it.,"I had what I think was an allergic reaction to this product: itching, burning on the inside of my body which lasted until the next day. I took an antihisamine to relieve symptoms. I had already taken pgx granules with a similar result (not as severe)--just had to test it I guess. I was VERY disappointed as the taste was good--the best one I have ever tried for a whey drink."
4,Good product but vanilla is better,"The chocolate does not mix as well as the vanilla, and for whatever reason, the texture is a bit slimy. I managed to get through the canister of chocolate that I purchased, but I'm back to the vanilla now. Whatever the flavor, it does work really well for controlling cravings and keeping your blood sugar stable. That said, losing weight is not easy, and there's more to it than killing the cravings. You need to consistently exercise, and find activities to replace recreational eating."
2,Worthless,"unless you are level 60 and member of a decent guild, do not buy this expansion. The planes are basicaly locked for anyone that can't get a full group of L61+, or multiple L61+ groups. Worst expansion yet.L61 Sk and L60 necro."
2,Digital optical output does not work,"I bought two of these because they were really cheap at radio shack. Though I had to resolder one of them they are fine as S-Video cables if you don't need digital output. However, the optical audio output DOES NOT WORK ON EITHER CABLE. There is clearly a reason why these cables were $3.00 each at radio shack.To double check I switched to the component cables that come with the xbox 360 and the digital audio worked fine.I posted this review because I want to make it clear that the optical audio does not work on these cables. It's not that the four other people with problems don't know how to plug a cable in."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I bought this at Sam Goody and they won't take it back, even though the Optical out doesn't work!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this cable!! The optical port does not work, at all! Its a POS!"
1,Same problem with Digital Audio,I had the same problem as the other reviewer regarding Digital Audio. DID NOT WORK. Very frustrating. Spend the extra money and buy the cable from MIcrosoft.
1,Waste of time and money,"As someone else said, I should have checked here first. Bought this and no digital audio. Waste of money, no support from Pelican."
3,Unintelligible noise,"Well, bands have to start somewhere, but i think its safe to say that if you are a true Pitchshifter fan and own all their albums then this one should be the one that collects dust the most out of them all. This is back when Mark Clayden was growling into a vocal distorter and the guitars sounded like mush, the same back forth riffs over and over. I think its safe to say they were into Godflesh at the time they started. The same can be said for the Submit E.P. because it is an equally tough listen. Bad lyrics, bad songwriting. After you listen to the whole album you'd think you were listening to a detuned radio. Get all the albums starting with desensitized and ending with their last album P.S.I. Those are the good albums and they all rule. Great band and one of my favs but their first album is not such a classic, but more a document of the band circa 1990. A skipper."
5,top chocolate/praline,"This is, like all Reber products, very fine chocolate, as described by the other reviewer (pistachio marzipan, hazelnut nougat/praline, dark- and milk chocolate). Not to be confused with other products carrying the name Mozartkugel as well, but not being as tasty (e.g. the Mirabell Mozartkugeln)."
3,Where to find the original Mozartkugel?,"Where in the U.S. can one find the real original Mozartkugel products?By the way, it's a bit odd to call an object a ""kugel"" when it's flat on one side, as these versions apparently are."
1,Piece of JUNK target,"I Just bought this product today at a local store. It is the exact same one, made by Crosman. I thought this would be really cool and nifty since it is electric and all. I took it out to the woods to try it. I set it up on a tree stump and went back about 35 feet. I hit it on the 4th try, right on the middle sized target. The sticker and round target all go flying off and are now on the ground. I proceed to try and hit the targets which are still very hard to knock down with a pretty good ""Remington Tac 1 Pump Shotgun"". The targets literally have to be hit from point blank to be knocked down. Also I hit the base a couple times while shooting and chips off plastic came flying off. The whole thing is now in a big mess and covered in tape after me trying to fix it. I would not recommend this target to anyone because it is so poorly made. It looks cool but is really a piece of junk. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
4,exactly what I needed,I bought this item to go with my sons softair rifle. They enjoy trying to hit the targets. I only wish the targets were a little larger.
3,Tiny Target,"My son has used the target for airsoft. He says it works well however, it's smaller than we thought."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I ordered the product for my son for Christmas. I was a little disappointed, but it was totaly my fault because I didn't pay attention to the dimensions. It was small. I was expecting bigger for air soft guns. But he will have fun regardless. Still good quality."
1,Don't purchase! Get Rand McNally,"Everytime I enter the name of a city this program tells me ""no match"". I then go through the cities listed and find the one I want. I have had to do this with large and small cities. I will go back to using my Rand McNally 1997 Triper Maker as it works when I enter a town."
2,not impressed,"I bought this product because I am a subscriber to National Geographic and have always been impressed with their magazine and maps. I was a little dissapointed with this product, in that it does not always find the towns and streets I am looking for, and the searching methods are a bit unuserfriendly. I also do not like the fact that it is CD-based, with no option to install everything on the hard drive. I don't use it much because I don't like searching for the CD everytime I want to map something. It's easier to look up a map on the internet."
1,Very poorly written,"I am appalled by the low quality of this book. The writing is weak and the examples are poor. Some features are described for many pages with many very similar examples and others entirely lack examples or explanation. There are plenty of cases when the book directly contradicts itself (p78 the database size is 8 million G in the table and 8 million T in the text; p82 there are 11 platforms in the table but the text says that there are only 9;...) In short, it appears that the book was never proofread."
1,Only Useful as Reference,"Perhaps I underrate this book as it might really be useful as a reference. But I am just a run-of-the-mill DBA. What I look for when a new Oracle version is out is a book that explains the new features in a readable fashion and that makes me understand anything required to pass the OCP exam (which is more than I will ever need in real life as the Oracle RDBMS is increasingly blown up with unnecessary features). This book is not a book that one would like to read cover to cover: it is very much written in the stile of the official Oracle documentation, constantly listing parameters over whole pages. This could be useful if you want to drill down into a certain feature, but in such a case you might want to turn to the online documentation anyhow. And you should have read an Oracle 10 New Features book that really made you understand the big picture beforehand."
3,"Not bad, not great","Not bad, not great. Mr Ault and Co. have a fair book. I feel that it might have been written in a bit of haste, and that it was written using the Beta version of 10g, as there are some things in it that did not work just quite right. Still, some good information and I'm glad I bought it. Looking forward to Freemans book as well."
2,painful to read,"After reading the sample and the three for-the-most-part positive reviews already posted, I took a chance on what sounded like a potentially overly-dramatic, corny novel. I was heavily disappointed. While it is not the worst I've read, this story is not one I'll be wasting my time re-reading. The characters fell in love unbelievably fast, and I would have missed it completely if I hadn't been told that they were ""in love"". The same issues were rehashed over and over, until the entire situation grates on you so much that you want to shake the hero and heroine. There was also massive build up to the love scene, but it never arrived. After a cheesy one-liner, the scene ends. All of the problems were resolved quickly and unbelievably, and made for an unsatisfactory ending. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes mature, intelligent characters in a romance."
2,All the quilting is done by machine,"The one thing you need to know before you buy this book is that it is strictly a book on MACHINE QUILTING. I feel ripped off. How can the author claim to show how different kinds of quilting look when she excludes the most fundamental form of quilting, i.e. hand quilting? Worse yet, a lot of the quilting is sloppily done. There are examples of crooked and misshapen quilting on almost every page. I feel that the quilts in such an expensive book should be examples of expert craftsmanship. Of the 60 quilts, there are only about a dozen that have any visual appeal at all. Most of these successful quilts are the ones where she did a lot of free-motion stippling, which at least adds a little depth. The author does have some great design ideas, but they are limited in execution by her dependence on the machine. You should at least look at this book in the store to see what she does with a log cabin."
5,Wonderful ideas for machine quilting,"I absolutely love this quilting book. I find it hard sometimes to think of different ways to quilt designs on my quilt. I want something unique and this book offers that. I found the pictures wonderful and unlike the first person to review this book (who must have been having an awful day- LOL), I found the quilting to be of good quality and the stitches can been seen very nicely. You do have to have an open mind to find this book useful- if you only want the same old standard quilting patterns and ideas, then this book is too interesting for you. Enjoy!"
4,"Good history, if a bit confusing","I knew next to nothing about the Greek war to separate itself from the Turks before reading this book. Only the highlights were in my mind, so I was very pleased to learn much more about this most interesting modern struggle. The author does his best in telling a very confused tale, although his habit of occasionally skipping back and forth, and some repetition, bothered me a bit. He also would give a quotation in its original language, and then fail to tell the reader what it said in translation! Unfortunatley, English is my only language, so I took umbrage at this lapse. The work itself moves fairly smoothly, introducing a vast number of people, and occasionally I got lost in all of the unfamiliar names and places, but that's my fault, and not the author's. All in all, this is a book that is well worth reading if you are interested in learning about its subject, as I was."
5,How can you sleep without this pillow?,"i simply LOVE these pillowsi haven't had a pillow that has worked so well for me, in oh, over 5 decadesi wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Medi-Flow water pillow!"
5,greatest book in the world,The Ghost ShipI liked it because I like mysteriesThis book is about three kids trying to figure out who killed the guy in the ship. They found out by reading a book. Find out who killed the guy.
4,The Ghost Ship Mystery,"During a trip to New England, the Aldens learn about a mysterious ship, the Flying Cloud, that had been lost at sea years earlier and that supposedly reappears during a storm. Can the children find the truth about the ghost ship before they are too late?"
5,"Dirt Cheap, Real Good is REAL GOOD","I bought DIRT CHEAP, REAL GOOD for a weekend trip to D.C. and I was blown away by the thorough research the authors had done on thrift shops in the area. They not only tell you where to go, but also include information about what to expect in terms of price, selection, and even atmosphere. The writing is lively and fun, and the book is illustrated with photos of many of the stores. This book is a gem for true connoisseurs of thrift stores and American popular culture."
3,A Bittersweet Thriller,"There are some things that I liked about the culinary thriller Bitter Feast. It has a pretty good plot, the acting is good all around, and there are moments of decent suspense. However, there are just as many things that I disliked. The movie runs 104 minutes, which is probably about 15 minutes too long for the subject matter. The movie moves too slowly. Also, I can usually sympathize with the killer in these revenge movies. But in Bitter Feast, I didn't think that just getting a bad review by a food critic deserved all the pain and suffering that was doled out to said food critic. So Bitter Feast didn't whet my appetite, but it isn't entirely bitter either."
3,Fantastic 4 are Ok!,"The Volume 3 is good. In some parts, Jhonny's flames are not so good. They made too much transformation on Ben's costume. My favorite episode is with Ironman.Stan"
2,Not for Baby Boomers,"I was prompted to buy this book because of an interview with the author on a local radio show. He gave examples of ""mysteries"" in songs including, ""What did Billy Joe McAllister drop of the bridge ?;"" ""Who was Carly Simon singing about in ""You're So Vain?"" Unfortunately, the predominant music covered was rock I have never listened to or rock stars I never cared about. I was disappointed.in ""You're So Vain""?"
1,"Absolutely, Positively, HORRIBLE!!!","Bought this video at a movie store that was going out of business for around 49 cents. Not at all worth the 49 cents to watch it! My home videos of my dog, is much more entertaining. The cover has nothing to do with the film. I'm so glad it's over...I'm giving it to my sister-inlaw, which I don't really care for very much. Hopefully she will know I don't like her after she watches it."
1,not worth it,"Alright! This was just stupid. It has some dad looking for his daughters in a maze cornfield. That's basically what it shows through the whole movie. Didn't even finish it, it was that bad."
2,"Come on, Give the guy some credit","I have to say the DVD cover lured me in. The design is great, although there are no killer scarecrows in the film, pity. I am giving the maker of this film some credit because he managed to capture autumn so well on film. The shots of the corn fields, the autumn trees, the fall wind, and the dreary skies are great. Plus, Halloween is my favorite time of the year, and he captured the mood perfectly. I would tell people who are big fans of this time of the year to at least look at it for the scenery. The 2 girls lost in the field were just terrible actors, and I agree with one reviewer who said the 'screaming into the camera' part was so annoying. Yet any film taking place during fall and Halloween in a cornfield has my attention."
1,DON'T EVER BUY THIS MOVIE This Movie Blows I'M SERIOUS,This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's waste of money. Trust me I have over 100 movies and this its by far the worst. I really wouldn't even give 1 star for it. Movie just doen't make sense.
1,Stay in the dark,I watched all three in this series and even though the first was not great it was the best of them all. The 2nd was the worst. Don't waste your time or money.
3,"Nice Movie Love Songs, But He Should Return To Pop Music!","I bought Michael's debut CD, ""I Can Feel You In My Heart"", a couple years ago, and still enjoy listening to his Pop CD. I just got his new CD ""Silver Screen Serenades"", and was a little disappointed. He decided to do a Cabaret/Lounge CD, and it's totally opposite of what I was expecting from this new release. His voice is well suited for Pop music, and not all this sappy Cabaret-Broadway stuff that my parents used to listen to. He's a good writer, and Pop singer, but this CD contains a lot of cover songs from the movies and it's something that the older 50,60 or 70-something generation will get into. His last CD contained a lot of fresh, original songs, and it's something that Michael Poss needs to pursue again. I hope he goes back to Pop music, and leave the Lounge/Cabaret and Show Music behind!"
2,okay vampire movie made with little cash,"Ironbound Vampire looks like it was made on very little cash, but it has it's moments. The use of Ed Wood veterans is a plus and the female vampire adds zing, but I'm confused by the reviews that say the movie has no T and A. My copy does. First by the lead vampiress and then later on. This is a cult movie so some will like it more than others. I give it two and a half stars."
3,NEWARK IS THE LAND OF THE UNDEAD!,"This horror cheapie reminds me of the days of straight faced shlock cinema before the genre was flooded with ""spoofs"". Highlights include shlock veteran Conrad Brookes as the classic monster movie butler, under used Deanna Enoches as a soulful vampiress who should do more work in this vein (SOMEBODY GIVE HER A VAMPIRE MOVIE OF HER OWN), and Johnny Link as the weirdest vampire's assistant since Dwight Frye! Ironbound Vampire reminded me of Al Adamson's Blood Of Ghastly Horror and Ted V. Mikel's Astrozombies and I give it TWO AND A HALF STARS. Invite your friends over and don't miss ALF's big scene or the spectacle of the old guy with the most monstrous ear lobes ever! SCARY!!"
3,check this out,"This independant movie is worth a look and claims to based on a true story. It seems there are vampires lurking in the tunnels of Newark, New Jersey!"
1,4 uses for an ironbound vampire...,"1 Take this video, drive to Newark NJ, find an open field, and drive an iron stake thru it.2 Rip out the tape from the cassette and use it as a Christmas decoration.3 Take an axe, chop it up, and burn it.4 Stick it onto Tom Lane's gravestone so when his descendants walk by, they'll be upset that someone used his likeness in this celluloid atrocity."
2,Improper description...,"I had to return it. It would have been useful if compatible. The construction of the thing seemed ok and very presentable.The thing is I own a Moto Q gsm. There is no real information about compatibility in the add so it was until I opened the package that a note informing about exclusive compatibility with Moto Q 2, was revealed.The location of the mini usb conectors varies by probably less than a cm. but it simply turns the thing useless if you own a recent model.(I'm still expecting my return to be processed, by the way)."
4,Product works as expected,"I opened the charger, plugged it in and was able to use it as expected. It also charges my spare battery in a seperate slot in the back."
3,What you see is what you get,"This charging station works as advertised. You must supply your own charging cord cord or usb cable. Those that came with the phone work fine. The relatively inexpensive travel charger for the Q sold by Amazon also works. When connected to your computer it will allow you to both sync and charge your Motorola Q.The unit is made from medium weight plastic and your Q slides in from right to left (facing). The three star rating is due to the fact that the station is just not a good value at its present price of nearly thirty dollars. In fairness, I knew that when I bought it but went ahead anyway because as far as I know its the only game in town at the moment."
2,Ummmmm... no.,"I reeeeally didn't like this thing. I had to jam my phone in it every time I went to charge it and it was just a matter of time before the usb end of my phone becomes unusable. I love the idea of these things, I own others for my otehr phones, but this one is just not well made. :("
1,Useless for my Moto Q,My Moto Q has a micro-usb bult-in to the side. This station has a mini. Nothing in the tech specs. Useless here. Not even a good door-stop.
2,You really dont need it...,"Its been said before, it doesn't come with a charger. It's simply a stand for your phone. It will charge a second battery if you need it. But the only reason I have a second battery is because the first one went bad. I would also be surprised if someone owns a cellphone that isn't in the case. So this means that you have to take it out of the case if you want to use this stand.So for what point would you buy this? Just lay the phone on the counter with your charger plugged in. You just don't need it."
1,Item returned,This item was returned to the vender. It is only compatable with a computer.It does not have an alternative 12 volt plug.
3,Do Not Buy if you have the AT&T MotoQ - Will Not Work!!!,IMPORTANT INFORMATION!!!This will not work with the AT&T; or any other Moto Q smartphones that have the Micro-USB adapter. It has the Mini-USB adapter which is used for older versions of the MotoQ and other non-AT&T; models.I am disappointed because it looks like a well made and convenient piece of equipment. Too bad it won't support the Micro-USB adapter which is the current standard for smartphones.No fault on the seller as it clearly states in the description this is for Mini-USB. I should have done some more research. I ended up throwing the thing thing away as it's not worth bothering with a return on a $4 item.
2,Doesn't work with Q9m or Q9c Verizon,"Seems like a good little charger. Functional. Easy. And the battery charging station in back is nice as well. Sadly it doesn't fit my Q9m. You have to really jam it on there and then it says ""This is not a valid Motorola Charger."" So it won't even charge it.If you had the classic Q I'm sure it would fit though. Still for 4 bucks, it's worth it if you've got the right phone."
5,"""This Ain't A Game"" is blazin'!","Ray-J's new album ""This Ain't A Game"" is blazin'! The album features everything from hot party songs to romantic ballads. The album not only showcases Ray-J's amazing vocal talents, but features remarkable beats produced by Rodney Jerkins, The Neptunes, and DeVante Swing. My favorite songs on the album are ""Wait A Minute"" featuring the always hot Lil' Kim, and ""Formal Invite"". I would definitely recommend that everyone goes out and cops this album because it's a great album."
3,Ahh Wait a Minute,"Before you run out and but this joint, remember that just because you have tight producer doesn't mean your CD is Hot. Remember a concept called songwritting? Yes songs 1-4 are tight, especially Formal Invite with it's familiar sapcy Neptunes sound. Takin' Control is produced by Ray J, and is suprisingly good. Very good. But not even Rodney Jerkins or Devante can salvage the rest of these poorly constructed songs, some with terrible hooks. Your best bet: Dub it or find it at the used CD store"
1,Oh pleeeeeease..........,"Ray J is lucky the minimum is 1 Star cuz i would have gave it 0 if i could. Don't listen to any of the other reviews. When i heard the single ""Wait a Minute"" i loved it and it's really very nice. But when i got the album and listened to it i had to stop after a while becuz ALL THE SONGS ARE THE SAME.... SAME BEATS.... SAME SOUND....I would even go as far as to say SAME LYRICS....this album is really boring... after a day i forced myself to listen to the whole album and almost slept while trying to do so... SERIOUSLY, don't waste your money on this... if u hear one song of ray j, u've heard the whole album !!!!!"
2,LEAVE THE CAREER TO BRANDY!,"I AM REALLY ANNOYED WITH ALL THESE WANNA BE ACTORS AND SINGERS THAT THINK THEY HAVE TALENT! RAY J IS A PLAIN EXAMPLE. HIS LATEST CD IS FILLED WITH A BUNCH OF REPETITVE SONGS THAT HAVE NO MEANING AT ALL.HE CANT SING FOR ...! AND ALL THE SONGS ARE OVER PRODUCED, AND BADLY WRITTEN. I THINK HE'S TRYING TO BEAT OUT HIS SISTER, BUT HE LOST IN THIS ONE.CANT ACT, CANT SING, DONT BOTHER!"
1,One Word - Awful,"I don't know how stuff like this actually sells but it probably will. It's unfortunate but if people really listen, Ray J just doesn't have much lyrical talent and probably doesn't have a good enough flow to be a force as a rapper. He's still Brandy's little brother just like the 1st single says and he will always be known that way. Other than Wait a Minute being semi-decent, most of this CD is trash. Buy the single if you wanna even go that far."
1,"Hey Man, what happened?","Ray J has talent but there is only 1 good song on this CD, the rest is hot garbage. Whoever did the A&R needs to be fired"
3,Aight,"I would have given this cd 4 stars, but I didn't realize there were two different versions of this cd until now, and I have the edited version so the song ""Wet Me"" isn't even on my disc. Whatever. The beats on this album are tight. Just make sure you pay for the cd with ALL the tracks on it."
5,"This ain't a game, it's AMAZING!!","WHOA!! That's basically all I could say when I was listening to ""This Ain't A Game"" by Ray-J. The album is amazing, and I'd suggest all of you to get it. My favorite track definitely has to be ""Wait A Minute"" featuring Lil Kim. She does some AWESOME vocals on this track. Ah well, trust me and get it!!"
2,As The Man says...,"This Ain't A Game! The title of this album may sound like a warning, and it is. It is advice that Ray J should have taken! His try-hard gangsta R & B act doesn't work as he is not really hardcore (anyone who is remembered only as Brandy's brother can't really be hardcore!) The production is slick but overly done, and the songwriting is barely adequate. Do yourself a favour. Do not by this album. There is so much more that you can get from a CD that you will never find here."
1,Ray J Said Die To Whitney,This Ain't A Game is about doing to people with drugs with poison in them- Ray J gave poisoned cocaine to Whitney Houston=murder. Help stop black people music by buying Ray J's music. Murder is Ray J's game.
1,"Hmm, where shall I start?","First of all, everyone should know, just because you get the Neptunes to to do a track,doesn't mean your whole album is gonna be tight. There's only so much the neptunes could do to help out Ray J. The hit song ""Wait A Minute"" is the best and that's the only reason why I gave this album 1 star. He should stop trying to play this hard-thug image and get with the real. If he continues to play with what he thinks is appealing or hot at the moment, he'll continue to produce lackluster albums with only one hit."
3,"I HAD A DIFFERENT OPNION ABOUT THIS ONE,UNTIL...","I must admit,when I heard Ray J(baby brother of Brandy) first two singles off this album-the club ready Neptunes productions""Wait A Minute""(featuring Lil' Kim) and ""Formal Invite""-I wasn'timpressed.That was until,I heard the ballad ""Keep Your Head Up"".Now that's more like it.It's a very uplifting yet accessible radio-friendly R&B balladthat features Ray J's boyish pipes.It has nice video too.I'm glad that Ray's record label chose this as his third single'cause the last two were predictible and eager-to-please.Ray J seemed awkard playing a thug,it didn't fit him.""Keep Your Head Up"" is a certified hit.If Ray J keeps going down this road,Brandy will be 'Ray J's big sister' instead of Ray Jbeing 'Brandy's little brother."
5,Ray J's Album Ain't A Game,"Ray J's album is hott! Anyone who is still considering picking it up should go and get it fast! I love all the tracks, but my particualr favs are Takin Control, Formal Invite, No More, Where Do We Go, Out Tha Ghetto, Crazy, and U Need It/U Don't ...oh This Ain't A Game too...hehe...That'd bout all of em...So go out and get his album please, cuz it ain't a game."
5,"A rare mix, educational and fun!","My 9 year-old son had to do a book report on a historical fiction book about Rome. We read this together, as it was a little above his reading level in places. My 7 year-old listened as well. We read it in 3 days, if they had had their way, we would have finished in one. They loved this story. I stopped in several places and we recounted the logic of characters, trying to figure out the mystery ourselves. I also had a map of ancient Rome handy, to follow the various wanderings of the characters. Knowing your Greek/Roman myths is a plus, this book is a great application for those just finishing studying the ancient myths. For those concerned about violence and character issues, there are many situations that present themselves in the story for discussion. We had a few times where we stopped and asked, ""What do you think about that decision?"" A great book, WE highly recommend it!"
3,Good for its historical insight,"Years ago, I took a class called ""Producing Asian-American Sexuality"" at Brown University in which we read this book. I may be a little sketchy on the details. But I think it contributes nicely to Asian-American studies with its focus on the history of activism. The articles talk about Asian Americans, particularly on the West Coast, who were influenced by Black Power, feminism, and the antiwar movement, and decided to start their own political groups. Its focus is on the 1960s and 1970s. I would add it to any Asian American studies collection. Further, I am sure that this book is required reading in a number of ethnic studies courses around the nation. So I'm a little shaky on the facts, but I recall this being a decent book."
3,Faron's last actual album,"Good news and bad news. First the good. Faron is in his best latter-day voice on this collection. The song selection is great, avoiding the usual Step One generic selections. Lots of twin fiddles.Now the bad. No notes, song info, just a blank insert that barely fits in the jewel case its so small. Awful graphics, looks like some old man made it on his 1984 apple computer."
2,Seriously?,"Seriously? $128.00!? For the Kindle edition? I give it two stars without reading it because that is simply exploitive. Why shouldn't poor people or even many people who work for a living not be able to read this. Such an elitist maneuver! Notice the trend these days? Even MIT and Stanford are offering material for free or for a very low price. Knowledge and education should be available to everybody, not just to those who spend their lives accumulating money. I will not buy this book nor will I look at it. I encourage others to do the same. Knowledge belongs to those with a longing, a desire for the truth, not to those that excell in the human rat race. OCCUPY AMAZON!!!Doh, sorry, got a little carried away there. But the argument's still sound. No one should charge this much for a book which makes it inaccessible for most ..."
5,One of the better science naratives for TV,"In the mid-80's Hawking announced that science was nearly over:that we had discovered everything and made math of it.The astrophysics people in testing if the universe was slowing down, using type one supernovas as mile posts, found that the universe was actually accelerating in the expansion that they measured by red shifts.Probably one of the most important discoveries of recent timeand since we haven't a clue what kind of energy exactly dark energy isor what much of the dark matter is like,it will involve new mathematics as well."
2,Mediocre,"While it was pretty interesting to see the excitement on the astronomer's faces as they did their work, I felt the video did not really frame well what they were trying to do. It wasn't really until the end that they brought up why this was such a big idea and what its implications were for the universe. So while not a terrible video, I fault it for failing to capture the imagination, the wonder, absolute hugeness (made up word) of this notion of an accelerating universe."
4,Beijing's Forbidden City,A perfect guide to this amazing site. An easy to follow map allows you to identify each court and the buildings in it. The photographs and illustrative material are of the highest standard and the clear and readable text guides you towards observing details which might pass unobserved by someone not too familiar with Chinese palace architecture.I would not have got anywhere near enjoying my visit to this famous spot without this book in my hand.
2,Maybe it's just me but pretty blah,"I was hoping to use this to sweeten home-brewed green and white teas, but there just wasn't much flavor or much sweetening. I'm keeping it to try over Greek yogurt as a dessert and hoping it will fit better there."
4,midwest underground,"This cd is comin str8 from the underground of the northside of flint, mi. It is strickliy underground and you have that feel when you listen to it which is what catches my ears. It's nothing but truth that goes on in flint. F.O.D. (faces of death) release on previous album before this called Midwest Poison. if you like this cd you should check out other flinttown artists and groups like Dayton Family, Jake the Flake, Top Authority, MC Breed, Mack the Jack'a, DFC, Operation 263, Low Life, Streetlife, Flint Pharmacy, Skanbino Mob, and many more. overall this is a tight cd to ride in the ghetto with."
2,dim,"These bulbs are not up to PIAA standards in output. They are made for a girl who drives a prius or a even a Kia. Even a ""Silverstar"" is brighter and less money."
4,Just rain and thunder - no music or spoken word,"I would have given it 5 stars, but in some places you can hear some people sounds way off in the distance. It's not enough to be annoying, but you do notice it the first time you play the CD."
5,big fan,Karen Cisco was an exciting action show. I don't understand why it isn't available on cvd yet. I certainly want to buy it as soon as it is available.
4,Waiting for the DVD release,"This isn't really a review but I want this DVD. I found ""Out of Sight"", based on the original Elmore Leonard book, with Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney a wonderful movie. I own that DVD. I remember seeing several critics praising this show but I couldn't find it and now I see it was canceled after a few episodes. I remember one critic (TV Guide?) noting the studio might try it again in the following Spring. That didn't happen. I'm hoping the studio is aware that in the new environment folks can give shows a second life. ""Dead Like Me"", ""Wonderfalls"", and ""Firefly"" are a few of my favorites. Let this review be my vote for ""Karen Sisco""."
1,Not for beginners!,"The step explanation is poor and the instructor goes too fast, as if she were in a hurry to fit everything she has planned in 10 minutes. I could not follow her at all and ended up discouraged and quit after 2 minutes. The instructor must think that just because she says, ""You can do it!"" repeatedly her audience can ""osmose"" the complicated steps she presents. This 10 minute solution is no solution at all."
2,Not incredibly impressive...,"As an individual with 18 years if dance experience, I had expected an individual tapped to make a dance oriented exercise video to be more impressive. Sandoval (the instructor) gave unclear direction at several points in the workout. Also, the choreography left something to be desired. Some of the moves, SHE frequently performed incorrectly because the counts were not consistent with the music. I have really enjoyed the 10 minute solution series, but this was a bit of a letdown. If I had trouble doing the moves, I would assume individuals without training would as well. Granted, I have a more discerning eye and am probably more interested in correct execution...still, I found this DVD frustrating at best."
2,Is she crazy??,"OK, first off - I gave this DVD 2 stars because I actually liked Stella. She seems personable, and is not annoying. However, she goes WAY too quickly. True, I do not have any previous experience in latin dancing, but I know how to dance - this was just too much!! She would barely get you through the moves before she started the next one. I just could not keep up with her. I also did not feel as though I was really getting a workout from this - maybe if I wanted to learn latin dancing, but I assumed it was a workout DVD? Maybe she goes too fast that I am not getting the benefits from the workout, but I do not like. I went with the Daily Dozen w/ Denise Austin instead for my quick workouts."
2,not happy,"Very little instruction concerning the dance steps before working into the cardio routine. I was frequently tripping over myself and rewinding the dvd to see what I was doing wrong. Overall, this exercise dvd was a lesson in frustration. I ended up doing jumping jacks when I couldn't figure out what the instructor was doing. Still on the hunt for a good Latin dancing exercise dvd..."
4,Fun and Effective,"I thought the cuing was just fine. It was fun and I've lost inches from my midsection and 6 lbs. It'll take awhile to get bored because every time I do it, I notice a little different style she adds to it. Easy to learn and fun to execute. Makes you feel sexy, too!"
1,Poor instruction,"The instructor is high energy and likeable, but the actual instruction is very poor. She confuses left and right and rushes through each section without good explanation of the steps. For example, the cha-cha step is not explained, just ""do a triple"". Also, I have taken Latin ballroom dance, and I felt like this video just threw a bunch of Spanish dance words in without consideration for the actual form. For example, the salsa segment never tells you that the salsa count is 1, 2, 3 (hold), 5, 6, 7 (hold). And then cha-cha steps are thrown in to the salsa segment. Messed up.This might be a fun aerobics DVD for someone who didn't care about actual dance moves. I was hoping for more."
1,didn't like it!,Unless you are latin and already are familiar with these dance steps- you will be totally lost. The instructor does not take enough time with the basics before she adds elements. I was very frustrated with this video.
2,Too Fast,"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge fan of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs. I liked all the ones I've bought. However, the instructor in this DVD seems to be dancing by herself and is not in tune with the audience. She goes too fast as if though she's in a hurry to complete this in 10 minutes. I got very discouraged trying to follow it the first time. Not recommended for beginners."
1,Not very good,"I just started taking kickboxing (Muy Thai) and thought this would be a nice supplement to my in-person training, but I was disappointed to see that there was very little instruction, and lots of random shots. I was expecting an explanation of each move, and some sequences that you could follow, but this video was not made like that. Although the instructor is a true master of the art, the video people that made this are true amateurs."
1,Who is Master K??????,"I have trained at a real Muay Thai camp and have to say that Master K is not exactly what I would call a household name in Thailand. In fact, he is pretty much unknown. That does not make him a bad teacher, though. What I was not impressed by was the athletic ability and the shape his students that he used to demonstrate the different techniques. Most of them were slow, sloppy, and looked incredibly amateurish. To me, that speaks volumes about the quality of the instructor. The video quality as well was very poor. It looked like someone took video from their Camcorder and then ran it through their VHS and voila! I would recommend going to a camp in Thailand or Fairtex here in the U.S. if you are really serious about Muay Thai."
3,Randolph Caldecott,"""Randolph Caldecott and the Story of the Caldecott Medal"" is a good book for the intended age level of the audience. So much more is known about Caldecott than the space allows. The information included is generally accurate, although some of the transitions seem to be conjectures instead of fact. Note about the other reviews: later printings of the book do not have the ""J"" in Caldecott's name.The best thing about the book are the fabulous color illustrations including several photographs of people and scenes, plus many illustrations done by both Caldecott and other illustrators of the time.My primary qualification for reviewing this book is that I've also written a biography of Caldecott, but for an older audience."
1,"No ""J"" in Randolph Caldecott's name","According to Randolph Caldecott's birth certificate, marriage certificate, and death certificate there is NO initial ""J"" in his name.Too frustrating that Mr. Bankston did not contact one of the two societies in memory of Randolph Caldecott for information rather than depend on the long time error supported by the American Library Association.Gwen P. Reichert, PresidentRandolph Caldecott Society of AmericaSt. Augustine, FL"
1,It's Delaware,"This book would be pretty cool. But, it is about Delaware! Come on guys, let's just face the facts: Delaware is possibly the worst state in the union. Sure, the first state and really important for chicken production, but after all, should we care that much?!? Speaking as a Maryland resident, we should just take it over."
4,Great old school Basie,"This is an album of great classic Count Basie. It captures the fun and energy of Basie as his orchestra played fast and furious swing. I'm not sure how much of this material is available elsewhere. Many of the cuts are radio broadcasts, so the sound quality isn't always very good, but this is the kind of music that made Basie's band so famous as a dance band: it's jittery, wild and contagous!There is at least one song with a Jimmy Rushing vocal. :)"
5,Vermont's best story teller does it again,"Joseph Citro's collections of Vermont folklore have become as much a part of the Green Mountain State as sugaring and the Lake Champlain Monster. GREEN MOUNTAINS, DARK TALES continues this series of terrificly readable and enjoyable stories based on Vermont folklore and legend. Anyone who likes the state or just likes a good story would do well to pick up this book. It makes for addictive reading."
1,citizenship made simple,"This is a book of such modest aspirations that it actually has very little in it that is useful. In addition, it leaves out some important and very basic pieces of information. For example, it claims there are four ways to seek citizenship but it neglects one of the most obvious. It is claimed that this book has received outstanding professional reviews in Library Journal and Booklist. I seriously wonder about that. I cannot believe that any reviewer would think this a worthwhile book.This edition of the book does not have the ""unique, updated Directory of Immigration Lawyers to assist readers in finding a suitable attorney"" mentioned in the editorial review above."
1,Where's the CEMENT lady ?,"This is a fantastic piece of British sleaze, but this dvd is CUT ! My favorite scene from this film is missing, the naked lady who slides out of a cement mixer into a gloriously sleazey pool of gloop. What a shame, thankfully I still have my Broadcast of this slice of demented sleaze, which the BBC kindly aired late one evening fully UNCUT.Shame about this dvd as this little gem of a movie deserves to be seen uncut. Includes an incredible performance from Patrick (CLOCKWORK ORANGE) Magee.five stars for the movie / one star for the cut dvd"
2,So bad...it's kind of good,"I have only seen this film once, many years ago. I was so impressed with Tony Beckley's performance in When a Stranger Calls that I decided to seek out his earlier roles. I stumbled across this British horror fim, and watched it a few times after that. It was so bad... it had me laughing out loud. I repeat, this was a long time ago... so my mind may be playing tricks on me. It concerned the story of a young man (Tony Beckley) and his overtly religious, massively psychotic, domineering mother. It explores how his longing to do good? drives him to kill young women so that he can ""save"" them. The corny music and funky clothes only add to the hilarity! Patrick Magee (of A Clockwork Orange fame) is once again over the top... & too cool for words as a mad priest. I only hope that I described this flick correctly. If you have a large supply of alcohol...& this film...you are in for a night of fun. Or it could just be my fading memory."
3,These Texan Men Come Alive,"I really enjoyed Stony Carlton in ""Taming the Lone Wolf."" The electricity flies in this story, although the heroine switches from gutsy to helpless a little too much for me... but give me a man like Stony - yum! I also like Hank, our football pro turned ZZTop band leader - what a contrast! In Diana Palmer's ""Redbird,"" these two thrown together by mistake have a relationship that is sweet fantasy, although I have no idea how she didn't give in (Diana Palmer's two heroines don't consummate their relationships without a wedding ring). But, who would name their daughter, Poppy? I had a tough time with that. Quick reads, all four, enjoyable!"
5,Merveilleux !!!!!,"Grab a glass of wine a beret and ........a French Pop CD ?Perfect happy little songs that make your head dance and your heart skipalong a hopscotch trail.After the first song on this brilliant line up of songs,you'll be humming the words in line at the local food shop.Sweet as the pastries you just put on the conveyer belt and the check outlady smiles and starts singing along with you..ahhhhhhh....and all is right withthe world."
2,Skills for actor series,"I have bought the entire selection of over ten Skills for Actors tape. I wish I hadn't have purchased the entire set at once, but only one at a time. That way I wouldn't be out so much money. I would not recommend them to anyone. It is just a complete and total money grabbing film series in my opinion. The only one to benefit from this series is the producer I thinks. On a scale of one to five, I give it a two for quality of production, and a zero (0) for content."
5,A great Jazz Artist! Great Sound !,"This CD has a number of good songs. From melodic to dancing, showing the real art of contemporaneous jazz. If you like Richard Elliot, Bonney James you will certainly like Ze luis."
2,More About The Travelers Than The Nile,"Some of the Nile, but much more of the travelers (whose situations seemed ""dramatized"" several times), and very little ""mystery.""When you title a film ""Mystery of the Nile,"" the buyer should expect to receive a little more history, in-depth information, and...mystery. This film is mostly just a travelogue of a group going down the Nile.And the soundtrack--awfully done! The music itself was interesting and appropriate, but it was mixed at such a high volume that you literally *cannot* hear what the narrators are saying much of the time. It's like trying to have a conversation with someone in a car while the radio is turned up all the way.Nice photography, but a very frustrating experience overall."
2,Egypt the Non mysterious bore nile,"Oh man this was so boring. We expected more then what it was. It was a 100 day journey in 70mins. This was a disappointment. There really wasnt anything you would watch to get info on Egypt. There werent any mysteries. A lot of people know that the Nile is dangerous, if not, well i just told you, there goes the whole story, your welcome. I think its funny how they said so many people died doing the rafting of it, yet they had beginers with then. They tried to over play everything an dit was boring. Good scenes some time, but if I wanted that i would have bought SCENIC ROUTE AFRICA."
3,Beautiful with the sound off,"Like many films in this genre, this one is often better viewed with the sound off. The blu ray transfer is good in most places and some of the cinematography is exactly what you want on a big LCD via blu ray. The narration is pedestrian at best, adding little and sometimes detracting from the enjoyment. It's a bit overwrought and melodramatic. If you can pick it up inexpensively, it does have some impressive eye candy."
1,Fake documentary,"Mystery of the Nile is an enjoyable movie. But many (re)viewers do not seem to realize that the whole ""expedition"" never took place. The ""expedition"" is pure fiction and mostly filmed in studios. The Lake Nasser storm scene is a very clear example. All team members are actors or at least playing a role. Saskia Lange is no Spanish journalist but a German soap-actress. I think they should not have pretended that this was real, they even made a book about the so called ""expedition"". Mystery of the Nile is a fake documentary, but a very good one."
3,"Amazing images, bad writing","The images were amazing, but the narrative was kind of insipid. Watching with the sound off would have been better."
3,Disappointed...,"This video is not a beautiful travel log of the Nile, it is a documentary about a journey on ONLY A PORTION of the Nile, and a lot of it was about the travelers difficulty getting the movie made and what they had to go through."
1,WMVHD doesn't work,"The little robotica video works, the menu loads, however the video will not play. When I try to open the video file from the DVD media player encounters a license key error. I will probably not buy any more WMVHD DVDs."
3,didn't meet expectations,"I love Georgia and all her silly mates! I was very excited to read this new addition to her escapades. However, I must say I was disappointed by it. I definitely didn't think it was as good as the others. Nothing happened. And I don't mean that in the same way that Georgia's book are composed of a myriad of triviolities. I mean, there were no events and hardly any interaction with the guys (including the hilarious Dave the Laugh). And when something was actually about to happen, the book ended.The book ended with me thinking, Hmmm...what actually happened here? And I wasn't able to think of anything except an entire book about Georgia ruminating about her love issues (which I enjoy, but it's not as much fun when that's all there is).Of course, I will continue to read and enjoy the series, despite the hideous new covers (and the size is different so they don't match any of the others I have), but please, Ms. Rennison, a little more substance next time."
3,All about boys.,"The seventh installment in the Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series is similar to all the rest. Georgia goes on and on about boys and ...well, mostly just boys. She may be quite literally mad, or possibly just a teenager. Whatevs, she's still completely hilarious and entertaining to read about even though she really doesn't say much on any other topic but boys."
3,The end just left you hanging,"This book was pretty good, vair vair funny, but it def left you hanging in the end. I mean, come on, we have to wait like, another year to find out if Georgia will choose Masimo,Robbie, or Dave. Besides that, the book spent way 2 much time on Geogria waiting for Masimo to call or something, and to top that off, whenever you think something substantial is gonna happen between Dave and Geogria, nothing happens! So, all in all, it was ok, but not one of the best."
1,i haven't read the book yet... hate the cover,"I love the Georgia Nicholson books. Love them. I haven't read this one yet, but I'm sure it's great. I'm waiting for my library to get it because I refuse to buy it. The new cover is completely unattractive. But mainly I refuse to buy it because you can't have a book series, and then start publishing more books in that series that don't match! It's common knowledge people. Harry Potter didn't. The Simpsons tried to with their Season 6 Homer head shaped dvd box and the people revolted, so they made Season 7 available in both Marge's head shape, and the box that the original 5 were packaged in. PLUS, they made available a way to order a Season 6 box that matched the first 5 seasons. What are the people at Harper Collins, and Louise Rennison thinking?!? Will not buy this book. They lost my sale."
4,Great,"Well done, a little hard to understand at times, however extremely useful and informative. He just doesn't go over other things about a house such as plumbing or wiring."
4,ECONOMICAL LOG HOMES,"THIS BOOK WAS VERY HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST HOME BUIDING PROJECTS. HAD EASY TO READ INFORMATION, GOOD INSTRUCTION AND HELPFULL HINTS THROUGH OUT THE BUIDING PROCESS."
4,Asterix Latine?,"Si quis librum Latinum ad copiam verborum facile augendam quaerat, etiam ad delectandum risumque movendum, moneo hunc comparet. Imaginibus enim et fabula sine dolore sensus verborum capietur, qua de causa aptus quoque discipulis est; ubi autem difficilior fit liber, auxilium sumitur ex pagina Latine Hispanice Anglice Germanice inserta. Omnes linguae latinae studentes talibus operibus subventuros sperem."
1,bogged down in cheapness,"This film is one of the most unintentionally hilarious romps since Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster. Its got terribly rubber FX, a cast of oldtimers, awful direction and acting, etc. The music sounds like it was taken from one of the samples on an electronic keyboard your kid brother has. But I wouldn't trade my copy for the world!"
5,A must for every lesbian,"This book has many insights, suggestions and hints for anyone interested in relationships, and aren't we all?"
2,too close to expiration date,"The test strips work ok with the device, but the expiration date was Dec. 2008. Still using them because don't want to waste them, but not sure how accurate they are."
2,Don't bother,"This fluff article does nothing more than hit the highlights of ""Good To Great"". The only insight is into some background of Jim Collins himself. He may think he is not Level 5, but his uneasiness with being written about is quite clear."
5,Suspenseful Page-Turner That You Will Love!!,"This wonderful romantic suspense is a page-turning, sizzling knock-out of a book! There is so much to love here - Eagle, the Chickasaw hero is everything a great character should be, complex, sexy, strong, tender and totally dedicated to those he loves. Some of the most beautiful writing in the book centers around Eagle's Native American heritage. And Dr. Kate Malone is more than his match. I'm glad the author showed the details of her Southern family, which made her adjustment to the Chickasaw tribal lands and people all the more poignant. This story is remarkable. There are timeless themes here: clash of cultures, blending old ways with new, clash between industry and environment, the bonds of family, and of course, the enduring power of love. Don't miss this book! BTW, the cover is not bad to look at either!!"
2,Boring,"Author story of witch dance was slow and very boring. Plot sim to be made up as she went. Same old thing, poor on description."
4,Good,This is a very good book. I just wish it had a little more to the ending of the story. If felt incomplete. Left me wanting to know more.
4,Good rainy afternoon read,Enjoyable story - good to take along to the pool or beach this summer. Not pulitzer prize winning or anything but still a nice way to spend a couple of hours!
5,Wonderful,Ceasefire is one of the best cds I have heard in a while. Salim is a masterful musician. Jal's rap sounds best in Nuer and the other African languages he speaks.The music vacillates between sub-saharan African sounds and more Arab rhythms but its all good.
3,a decent value,not a bad little dictionary/phrasebook for general purposes - the pronunciation guide was valuable.
4,Terrific,The entire family enjoyed this show. We watched the movie several times before it expired and it never bored the children.
5,4 Thumbs Up!,"4 thumbs up from our 4 kids! Great movie! Great story! If you liked Hero of the Rails, you'll like this movie a lot!"
4,Perfect Mystery for a preschooler,Thomas and Friends fans will love this new movie. It has great new songs which my boys just love and the plot really kept my son's interest. It also comes with book in the the DVD case. Great buy.
5,4 year old loves it,"Since getting this movie last week, my son has watched it so much that he has it memorized. There are new characters so he is very excited about that and a few new songs that get played endlessly. This appears to be his favorite Thomas movie so far."
2,Terrible video quality,"It's a Thomas video. Your kids either love him or hate him. My 1 and 4 year old love him, so I grab any video I can find. I can't comment on the story much; again, it's a Thomas video made for kids. What do you expect? Daring plots, suspense, and drama?However, what I couldn't stand was the video quality. I've purchased many blu-rays in my time and have seen a lot of different video qualities all around. I must say, this is honestly one of the worst. One of the older DVD's (far cheaper) has much higher video quality. Grainy blacks and washed out colors all around. It's not my TV/setup, other blu-ray videos are simply gorgeous. This is just completely lacking all around.Again, I understand that my 1 and 4 year old don't care about quality, but when I shell out $20+ for a blu-ray, you would think it would be at least decent quality."
5,Thomas the Tank Engine rocks,This and all Thomas products are true family fun. If your child likes trains you need to get all of these movies and games.
5,Cute Movie,"I bought this for my friends son who is four. He has watched it about 10 times in a week... I have watched it with him- Its a cute story line.. Not muct to add as its a Typical Thomas tale, just a new journey- Another winner for Thomas!"
4,Blue Mountain Mystery,"My Grandson loves anything Thomas and really loves this movie. For some reason when he first started watching it he was scared. He would hold my hand or hide his eyes, but the more he watched the braver he became."
2,A bit too scary for a small child,"My almost 4 year old son asked me to turn this off. He loves Thomas, however this one he thought was too scary."
5,toddler loves thomas,got this for my three year olds birthday and it was a hit he likes it and the little green train!
5,thomas video,i think my nephew is going to love this. he is infatuated with Thomas and he can add it to his collection.
3,Okay DVD,"I like the concept of the little train Luke hiding out,because he thought he had made Victor get lost at sea, it really needed more depth as far as the characters, and the storyline, the section where Thomas is almost falling off the platform, was way too similar to the part of Diesel falling of the unfinished rail in ""Misty Island Rescue"", not that my 4 yr old notices the similarity, but c'mon HIT Entertainment, dig a little deeper. Overall, it was ok, and again my son loves all things Thomas!"
