3,Parrot sound Librairy,"Feathered Phonics, Volume 3, is advertised as an easy way to teach your bird words and sounds. Well, yes, if you are careful not to bombard the poor bird with the same sound for too long, say, two or three minutes at most. Of course you need a CD player that will repeat a single track.Still, teaching a bird by associations - by seeing, hearing and sometimes tasting all at the same time is best.A friend used the CD and was not careful to limit the exposure of a single sound - When the bird now hears the sound of a cow he freaks out!This is not a CD that you turn on and simply let run, because 96 sounds and words will drive you nuts.The CD is simply a sound source that you have to work with."
2,Mediocore,"This product was terribly disappointing. It was the human track saying ""quack quack quack"" and the human sheep saying ""baaaa"" did it for me...just dumb. I would have given it one star, but I agree with a previous poster that some of the other sounds were pretty good. Not sure it's worth the money tho. IMHO"
1,Started rusting inside after only one week!,"The first Tiger PDHB30U kettle I purchased started having rusting spots inside only after 2 weeks. I have been gone through many hot water kettles for the past 20+ years, this is the first time I have seen anything like this.To make a fair judgement, I returned the first one and bought an identical unit. This time it only took a week for rusting spots to show!I strongly recommend people stay away from this kettle. Spend a little more and buy a Zojirushi kettle!"
3,USE ONCE A YEAR!,"Packaging very nice lay out. I needed to drill and tap 6 holes in the heads on my 460 cu in engine. First hole the tee handle gave up. I used the big one, the jaws would not grip the small head of the 3/8 tap. I got a vise grip and tightened it to tight and striped the threads on the tee handle. The small tap holder found it to be to small for the leverage I needed. Second hole was the last hole the 3/8 tap did. It was dull'er then a hoe! Went down to NAPA bought a tap and finished the job with that one. Needed a 1/4"" bolt thread's chased. The threads had been damaged when we removed it from the hole. Ran the 1/4"" NC die across the threads and bingo I had some threads but they would not fit the nut anymore. I re threaded the nut with the 1/4""NC tap and now I had bolt and nut with some bastard thread that only this tap and die set could make another. WHAT the He l!"
1,unhappy customer,"These taps are not what i expected. The threads were put on the tap, then the slots were cut for the metal shavings.The threads were filled up with the metal that was pushed out when the slots were cut. They did not even try to clean the threads up. The threads also had nicks on them where they were banged together before the were hardened."
3,45 piece Metric Titanium Tap and Die Set with Case,"No problems with shipping, arrived on time and undamaged. Plastic case sucks. Pieces keep falling out of their storage positions every time you open the case.The taps and dies are okay, but the labels embossed in the plastic are not very good. Overall I got what I paid for as a really good set is very expensive."
4,Good movie with raw street appeal,"This movie though the content is racey, was told very well, a story about street life in Scottland. Theyre english is at times hard to understand as their accent was extreme but understandable. This story was told in a unique way, in such a talented way. I am a Hans Matheson fan so I had to add this to my collection and the young actress portrayed the lifestyle so well, and her eagerness to turn a different path and escape that life was compelling."
4,It's a perfect combination of film meeting the page.,"If you know who Christopher Doyle is then you should already run out and get this book. If not, then use this book to acquaint yourself with Hong Kong's premiere cinematographer. He is a photographer like no other with a rythmn all his own. Some of the photos are from the HK films he's worked on, others are from things he's shot outside the cinematic realm. Give it a read, it'll be worth your time to get to know his work. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I thought it should've been longer."
1,Very Chintzy. A co-worker even asked if I got them at the dollar store.,"The order arrived 3 days later than the latest delivery estimate. The Pearls themselves are small and dull, and both the bracelet and the necklace are small and fragile. They don't even come in a nice box or any box at all for that matter. I would not buy this set from this seller again. I am currently trying to decide whether I will even give this as a gift at all (as it might make me look really chintzy just like the pearls) or should just send it back for a refund (unfortunately it is mere days till xmas so I think I might be stuck)."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I ordered this product on looks alone, not realizing the barrel portion inside is heavy cardboard with a plastic liner for the ice itself and I think the exterior a thin molded plastic.I imagined it to be a solid heavyweight plastic- so do not know how long it will stand up.I still like the looks of these ice buckets, just wanted a more solid item."
3,A Flawed Effort,"Louvish seems to spend about a third of the book on Fields' life, another third criticizing Robert Lewis Taylor's earlier Fields biography, and a final third relating the history of the English Music Hall circa 1895-1915. (Pages and pages of this with no mention of Fields whatsoever!)Taylor's book may be innacurate-but as another reviewer noted, it's a heck of a lot more entertaining."
1,"Fun man, not so fun book","WC Fields was a funny man with a lust for life and entertaining, but if you only read this book, you would never know it."
1,not what i ordered,i dont know what happened exactly but i Ordered the necklace above but was sent a girly looking S necklace. in my package i got a note that said the necklace does not match photo or description. yea so.... if your looking to buy the necklace that you SEE then contact THEE1900 First and make sure that it IS or ISNT the necklace in the pic.i did email the seller wanting to return it and hopefully the seller will be kind and refund me my money And Shipping.chloe
1,Waste of Money!,This game consists of a deck of cards with pictures of animals and nothing else. The $7.00 + shipping was clearly and waste of money. Pictionary Jr. is a much better choice and the whole family can enjoy and have a great time!
3,Didn't last long,"The gun shot well and my sons loved it. Unfortunately, it broke in a couple of weeks of use ."
4,Gritty SF Adventure,"Set in the Alliance-Union Universe, a gritty SF drama showcasing C. J. Cherryh's incredible talent. Award History: 1983 Locus Poll Award Nominee for Best SF Novel. Wonderful full color, wrap-around jacket in the classic style by R. Courtney. Also check out another wonderful book set in Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe - the character driven space adventureFinity's End"
5,Captivating Love Poems,"This is my favorite book. It is one of those books that constant re-reading only improves. The poems and pictures are so well-paired that they give insight to each other. There is a poem for every feeling and kind of love. I used some of the poems at my wedding, and I will be buying it as a wedding gift for a dear friend."
3,Great product but materials are flimsy,"I received a GoldTouch keyboard in 2005 that was solid, sturdy and well-built. I absolutely loved it. But I just bought this new Mac-compatible version and the quality of materials has really gone down. I can see that the pin holding the adjusting bar can break from the snapping motion required to position the keyboard. I am afraid to adjust it often. I recommend this keyboard if you have pain to resolve, but otherwise, the keyboard is overpriced considering it may have to be replaced in less than a year due to the cheaper materials."
4,Great for mouse & keyboard user,"I love this keyboard.I was having issues, not only with my wrists, but also in my shoulder. The small footprint and removal of the number pad allows me to place my mouse closer - eliminating much of the pain I was experiencing in my shoulder.Perhaps I have a different model than the other reviewers, but I have no problem with the materials.My only complaint is the moving of some keys, like ctrl, which is place annoying close to help and pwr."
5,Very good product,The keyboard has a great touch and it does everything I expected. My wife has carpal tunnel syndrome and she finds it comfortable to use.
3,Nerf Refills,"Not what I would choose for a girl, but it's what the grandaughter wanted, so she got it. Her Mom reports that she loves it! That's what matters."
4,Bought as replacement for Nerf gun,"Had to buy these to replace the lost balls for the Nerf gun. Price is ridicules. Over $1 for each ball but the only balls that work with the guns. Won't replace them again, the guns are going to get throw away when the balls are lost."
1,Nerf Balls,"These are not your Grandma's Nerf Balls. They're hard little babies who can't be thrown around without breaking something.In the early nineties, I had plantar fasciitis which I treated with Nerf Balls in the heels of my tennis shoes. These are not they."
3,Nerf ballistic Balls--refill,These soft Nerf balls used in a spring operated air toy are fun to play with and don't harm the persons or furniture if used inside.
3,"HEAVEN ON EARTH ? So,Thats how he can afford IT ???","666: THE BEASTTheasylum.cc"" Genre that wouldn't die, ANTI-CHRIST CINEMA !""In the tradition of Devil's Advocate, Omen , and Stigmata...Well sort of.This is a direct sequel to 666: The Child,And the boy has grown up and become the leader of the devil's new army.The director's commentary will amuse and there is no fighting for the microphone like Theasylum's usual.Collin Brock as the lead priest is the best of male leads, Great accent.The actresses are very well represented by- Makinna Ridgway is very talented as our resident good girl and The Bad Girl, Alma Saraci steals evey scene she is in with a million dollar arse( Which the producers INSISTED on showing numerous occasions).The film was good and obviously the original did well,But would have preferred a sequel to DRACULA'S CURSE, lol!"
1,Asylum should be punished by learning about originality.,"The writers who work for this company should be punished by being forced to learn how to write original movies instead of ""mock busters"" or rip offs. This movie is a a bad rip off of Omen:Final Conflict. The religious film Megiddo was better than this garbage. The only cool thing about this movie was the ""bend over"" shots of Alma Saraci. Now this company has ripped off Battleship with their version called American Warship, Iron Sky with their version called Nazis at the Center of the Earth,and now they're going to rip off Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter with their version called Abraham Lincoln Vs. Zombies. You're better off watching Omen:Final Conflict and Megiddo instead of this rip off garbage."
1,Worst film ever?,"How this film got funding or had the nerve to be released who knows.Comments made when watching were maybe it'll get better if we stick with it after the first 20 mins. Read a similar review elsewhere and the fact is it only goes downhill.Its so bad its almost laughable , awful acting, sea sick camera work and a college project would be more slick.Didn't think many films would challenge Blair Witch 2 for not living up to its advertising image and expectations but this is even worse.Glad to have a copy to force other people to watch it though for its laughter factor or maybe the CIA can use it to dull some senses in prisoners.Easily the worst film i've ever seen so atleast it has some claim to fame."
1,PLEASE,Don't you hate people who lie about a movie because they have some personal involvement in it? Ignore the other reviews. This is garbage.
2,Unsettling packaging,"This is a packaging-only critique, except I've given ** because I don't want to drag down ratings of the content. I have not played the DVD.I'm not familiar with ""Mad Phat Enterprises"" but the disc I received looked like a home made copy. The plastic case is transparent with no printing, and the DVD is plain with type on it.Nice to get ""Blue Murder at St. Trinian's"" but if I'd known it was not a professional DVD, I wouldn't have bought it ($23)."
5,I couldn't stop reading until I finished it.,I really enjoyed this book. Hughes does good work with her characters; they were realistic and believable. Her style really flows. I just read and read until I finished and then I wanted more. I highly recommend it.
1,not the tao te ching,"This may be a fine book for parenting/motherhood, but it is not Lao Tzu's tao te ching. His classic text has broad applications to many areas of life, but the stretch to motherhood is too great."
2,not much to see here,"With the notable exception of frontal nudity from Clive Owen, this movie doesn't have much going for it. Alan Rickman's part is small, not to mention the fact that his performances in other films are far superior to this one. Even for a seasoned Rickman fan, this movie holds very little entertainment."
4,DISTURBING MOVIE ... BUT EXCELLENT,"This movie, because of the subject matter, was done very well, and I really got wrapped up into it. I thought it was very good and am glad I got it for my movie library."
4,Close your eyes,"I liked this movie ! It has everything. character developement could have been better. maybe longer movie? I like Clive ,Reeves new too me(i`ve ordered 2 more of her movies) It was a hard subject to make a movie about.Reeves would have been Greater with just a LUST story. Wish thet would have pushed the envelope more ! ! (incest has been here since Adam an Eve)"
1,Not the best,"I recently purchased this shaver and I am less than thrilled. The double sided trimmer blades make it VERY hard to shave without hacking away the hair you aren't intending to shave. It works somewhat okay wet, though it takes a long time to get very good results. Dry, forget it. I must have gone over the same spot fifteen times and with very very little noticable hair shaving.So, save your money and look into another brand. Preferrably one with only one trimmer blade."
5,"Great Bag, Very Durable.",Bag is smaller and perfect for the kid who loves baseball! Got this for my 8 year old nephew and he thought it was great! The stitching is very good and seems durable and for the price I think it's a great gift fot any young child.
3,Lots Left,"Epson makes fantastic printing products. Here is the problem there is still lots$$$ of ink left in the cartridge when the printer tells you to change cartridge. After hearing this I cracked open about 10 C82 cartridges I have saved and was shocked to see that they all had ink left, and the worst of them were still 4/5 full (about 4 out of the 10). Here is what I suggest. Weigh a new cartridge on a postal scale; weigh one that you know to be empty. If the printer wont let you continue using a cartridge that you suspect still has quite a bit if ink left, get the weight and send it to epson and demand a prorated reimbursement."
3,expired product but company says it will stand by on it,"Expired product but company says it will stand by on it. Bought 2 boxes so it will be a while before I will be able to test out the 2nd box. So far using 2 of the 4 tanks in the first box. They are working fine. But I need to reserve judgement until I use the 2nd and or if I have problems, how will the company deal with it. They should advertised that their product is expired, though I should have suspected because the price was so good."
2,Monkey Butt Sex,"This is the infamous ""Monkey Butt Sex"" storyline, opening with an entire chapter of proto-human sex and violence. If Monkey Butt Sex is the type of thing that might bother you, you may want to spend your money elsewhere.This opening is either an homage to Kubrick and Clarke's 2001, a parody of 2001 or just plain derivative.The Monkey Butt Sex does serve the story, which tracks the first superhumans to the present, so it's not actually gratuitous, although it is probably more graphic than needed. But the story is itself somewhat lacking -- slow paced, poor dialog, and repetitive. Characterization is flat. It is not one of the high points of the series.The art is great, as you would expect from Oeming -- stylized, with lots of hard black lines. Monkey Butt Sex never looked so good.Fans of the series will want to pick this up because it leads into the next book, but new readers will want to avoid it -- it doesn't hold up on its own, it barely holds up within the context of the series."
3,Eh ... Not So Great,"This gets away from the police procedural thing that Bendis writes so well, and becomes a more typical superhero thing. As such it's well-illustrated in places, but not especially unique or even interesting. It ties in with the rest of the series, but not in any particularly enthralling way."
4,Good - fills in more background but not neccessary,Good Powers story that fills in alot of background - but its misleading to think that this answers any questions as to why or where the powers come from. This is all about the backstory to Diamond and Wolf - albeit still a good Powers story. Get it if you're fan but be warned its not important in terms of the continuing storyline from the last TPB.
3,good fit but.....,I ordered these for my fox terriers in the size recommended and they fit well AFTER I made additional holes in the strap so it was tight enough ( I needed a hole at least 2 inches from where the manufacturer's hole stopped) and the basket tends to rub the hair off the dog's muzzle so I glued sheepskin to nose bridge - it helps some. I also attached the muzzle to a buckle collar as my dogs are able to remove the muzzle when it's on by itself. This sounds like alot of complaints but compared to other basket muzzles this is a good one. And my dogs are much happier in them than the canvas muzzles.
1,3 Times Not a Charm,"I loved boy's life 1 & 2. The cover of Boys life 3 claims that ""3 times is a charm"". Sadly, nothing could be farther from the truth. Frankly, Don't waste your money. The first story inside out was mildly amusing despite the fact that it didn't go anywhere. With regard to the other four stories, I found more entertainment in watching a bag of popcorn pop."
3,Why so expensive?,"I was interested in seeing this because Christina Crawford makes a cameo, and I'm a big fan. However, what's with the steep price? Even for $20 from a Marketplace Seller, I don't want to spend that much for something I may only watch once. These titles are not available for rent at the video stores."
2,This ring is only worth the price if you never put it on. Ever!,"I purchased this ring as a surprise for my wife when I thought it would look perfect in a set next to her more expensive engagement ring. On Wednesday, she got home before I did thanks to UPS; the Cat was out of the bag! She liked the ring so much; she had it on when I got home. The following morning, wife calls and tells me when she got to work that one of the 5 tiny stones was missing. Sure enough, upon close inspection, I was rather surprised by flawed design of defective support structure inadequate hold the stones in place by wedging a round-shaped object between a flat surface on the one end and a single prong on opposite side of stone. Here is the Top View of the ring (SCALE 2:1), the O's represent each stone and support structure, where X marks the location of missing stone.... |x><O><O><O><O|All we could do is count our good fortune that we were not planning to use it in wedding ceremony."
1,This ring went back to the seller,"Two of the stones were damaged. One had a crack in the middle, and the other stone had a huge chip. I was not worried about getting a perfect ring for such a low price , but the ring was described as having a ""very good cut"", and the truth was far from it. Maybe I was just unlucky."
2,"Very milky, white stones---Not like the picture!","You get what you pay for in a cheap ring. These stones are very milky, white appearing and don't sparkle much--I guess that is what J-K means. The shipping was fast and packing good. There is a prong on either end of the ring that catches on things. I didn't notice when I purchased but after putting on I noticed right away and it concerned me that I may scratch my kids with it. My husband called the ring ""gaudy"". I plan on returning it. It might work for you if you just want a diamond ring and don't care if the stones are milky because it is a really, really good price."
2,The Homecoming,"was a minor chart hit from the mid 70's. This CD features a different recording. Not to say that's bad, Hagood's work is pretty good on this offering. But for a singles collector, it's not the version we heard on MOR stations."
5,The Homecoming has come home,"I have not purchased the CD 'Alone' yet. The song I was hunting for was 'THE HOMECOMING'by Hagood Hardy. I first heard this song by Hardy in 1976 and fell in love with it. I am purchasing this CD just so I can have the one song. I am not a piano lover, but I love Hagood Hardy's piano."
3,very back to nature,"I bought this CD a few years ago and keep it at work for when I'm having a stressful day. The CD is relaxing and makes you feel like you're a guest in an indian teepee. There's a lot of nature sounds that are refreshing, but the chanting is a little annoying on some of the songs."
4,"Sparkling Elizabethan romance, deft historical detail","A dashing gentleman of 16th Century England might dare to break the rules, especially if, as tensions rose with Spain, he found his heart lost to a Spanish lady. So Nick Beauvallet, knight and sailor, who dares much, and whose manservant Joshua is himself worth the book. The author's keen eye for history, and neat writing, make her work delightful."
2,Missing Something,"I've read most of Georgette Heyer's books and this is not as good as her other romances. The problem is that there is no real connection drawn between the characters. The heroine's father alludes to the fact that the heroine was attracted to Beauvallet even before she met him, but it is not really expanded upon. Things are more on the surface and you really don't get any insight into the characters. I guess the problem is that they are more superficial - more card board-like characters."
3,"Pirates, Adventure, Romance","the true story of the Queen's pirate, Nicholas Beauvallet, how he finds love on the high seas, and moves heaven and earth to secure his happiness with the woman he loves."
5,Excellent!,This is one of my favorite Georgette Heyer books. I enjoy the plot development and the character development. This is a high adventure romance book without inappropriate relationships.
3,Early Heyer book,"This is one of Heyer's earlier works, and it shows. It's still a good book, and I recommend it, but don't expect quite the same tight plotting and characterization, or the wry humour of her later books.Nicholas Beauvallet is an engaging hero, but a larger than life version, apparently unkillable and lucky beyond possibility! Heyer has seamlessly blended real people and history into her narrative as she so often does. In all, a good read, one no hardcore Heyer fan should miss."
5,A good reference,"I like this book. It's very affordable for the quality of the book itself--I purchased it to have as a handy reference. As a reference, it is quite good, though topical. I have had several compendiums on fighter aircraft, but this one contains strange/one-off fighters I have never seen before (Caudron-Renault C714 Cyclone anyone?). The data for each aircraft is not too detailed, but it's worth having in your aviation library."
2,Great printer- when it works,"This is a review based on the S300 printer, which appears to be nearly identical to the S330 except for the swoosh on the front panel. I bought an S300 for my MIL based on excellent reviews and the small ink tanks being appropriate for her light use.FWIW, the Mac print driver is hard to use and buggy (Canon doesn't seem to care much about the Mac market), but that's not the reason for the rating.The first printer started misfeeding and mangling paper at 8 months, before the first ink cartridge had even been used up (and the cartridges that came with the printer aren't even full cartridges!).The replacement printer died two months and about 50 pages later.She's on her third printer, and I'm in the doghouse."
3,"Good Quality, Fair Value","I am happy with my purchase of this Canon S330 printer, but have found better value printer and printer/scanner/FAX combos available for a much lower price locally. The Canon S330 is reliable, moderately fast and quiet, but it seems to go through ink cartridges pretty quickly (although the cartridges are cheaper than most, especially on Amazon, and easy to replace). Unlike several printers I have had before, when you change the ink cartridge, the printer is good to go, without time consuming print head alignment. This is a good quality printer at a reasonable price and has held up to some consistantly heavy print jobs without fail. I am happy with my purchase, but will definitely opt for the newer, lower priced printer/scan/Fax type accessory the next time I am in the market."
3,Old but good,"Canon S330 is a good older printer, very user friendly if you are using older Mac versions like 10.5.8 or Windows XP.Unfortunately the one I got, which was a used one, came defective and I had sent it back to the seller for a full refund."
2,OK While it Lasted,"After several years of seldom use, it eventually just stopped printing completely. At first I thought it was the ink, so I replaced all the ink. Then I thought the ink had dried on the nozzle, so I thoroughly cleaned it. After that, it printed for a few weeks, but with obvious lines which could not be resolved through the ""head adjustment"" process. Eventually, I just threw it away and bought a new laser printer, which I'm very happy with (so far). In good faith, I cannot recommend the Cannon S330 as it was simply too much headache for not enough printer."
2,Was Good While It Lasted,Purchased this item about 1-1/2 years ago....worked great...loved it....BUTnow will not print whole documents..starts off good for the first 2-3 lines than goes spotty....Purchased a new print head..worked for one or two printings...than went spotty again...Canon says...need to get a new printer.Sad...
2,unreliable,"My experiences with the Canon S330 have been similar to those of other reviewers here. My S330 worked really well for the first 1-1/2 years, and then the print heads began to fail. The print was fuzzy and ugly horizontal lines appeared. Cleaning the print nozzles did't help. Alligning the print heads became almost impossible as each setting produced a similar wavy result. Need I mention that I have bought an untold number of cartridges -- even when using draft quality printing? Both print heads are shot. After owning this printer for two years, I can either replace the heads or buy another printer. If you can get a new or close-to-new one cheap, then I recommend this printer. If not, then take a pass."
1,It WAS great... was,"This printer was incredible, especially for the price. It was fast, it was pretty, even made some great funny click noises the reviews said were OK.But the quality diminished over time. Then I changed a blank ink cartridge, and poof. Nothing, no printing at all. I cleaned the head unit that holds the cartridge. No Go. Suprising, I had a B\W canon for years and years and years, I wasn't expected this."
1,Canon S330 Printer,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!!!!!Little over a year passed with reasonable use and the printhead wore out. This is a pathetic printer and I am extremely angrey with Canon about their pricing of printheads. It is a scandal and a rip off!!Make sure you do a little research before buying a printer in this price range as I am told that many companies use the same trick.I gave this printer a 1 star because I could not give it none!!!
2,"Slow, noisy, ink hog","I have had mine for almost 2 years, and it has stopped printing black ink. Obviously time for a replacement, grrr. I never was completely happy with the unit. It constantly goes into a lengthy cleaning cycle before it prints. Very annoying when you want to quickly print off directions when you are late for an appointment. Extremely loud, and an ink hog (though you can buy cheap non brand name replacement cartridges). Print quality when working is near photo quality, and the unit is compact, but I REALLY expected more than 2 years of occasional use. And now I have 10 spare ink cartidges for a printer I need to replace."
2,Color me clogged!,"So glad I checked this site. I thought it was just my machine. I had a fabulous Epson printer that I had for approx 5 or so years. It finally started to die on me. The sales person said this was the comparible printer, so I took it home. I used this printer for approx. 6 months before the issues started. Ink was blotchy, so I switched to 3rd party ink-with the sponge on a relative's suggestion. However, after 2 weeks, then it didn't work at all. I thought it was because I bought 3rd party ink. Nope, this printer is just a waste of time. I always turned it off unless printing, switched all ink out at once and still it died. I used to swear by Epson. Now, I am considering Cannon. I just don't know. I just want to print text work from home and the occasional picture. Doesn't anyone make a decent printer any more?"
2,"Ink Hog, Cannot Print If one color is Removed","Great print, good functionality, EXCEPT I get the feeling that the product is designed to create dependency on ink. I have had other printers print as well, yet did not hog ink and they allowed me to continue printing in emergency situations if one of the color ink cartridges ran out. If one cartridge goes out the printer will not allow printing. Even if I am printing black text it will not allow me when the yellow cartridge is gone. I have spent more than six times the cost in ink than the printer itself in less than two years. They have a great product that helps the manufacture obtain their designs, increase ink sales."
1,Faded Glory,"This printer is a bust to me. My epson 740i produced sharp, clean, clear, and vibrant prints. The prints from the C82 are a disappointment. They are flat and without the tonal range of my less expensive, but now broken, 740i.I cannot tell if it is the durabright inks or what. I want to return mine, and I hope I can.The noise it makes when loading the paper is SO LOUD that I thought I had broken it. I don't know why it has to make such a noise. PLUS, it is very expensive to buy inks. The C80 color inks do not work in this one, but the C80 black ink does. I guess the waterproof selling point is not for me. I miss the impact of a truly wonderful glossy print. This printer does not amaze. It disappoints. I truly wish it were otherwise."
1,It died.,I've had this printer for a year and half. I don't use it much and it seems to have died of neglect. I went through all the possible remedies in the Epson manual including spending $75 on new Epson ink cartridges and it is dead. I will never buy an Epson product again.
2,"Great for text (with photos) when it works, on regular or bright white papert","The quality for text and photos on bright white paper is very good. BUT, do not expect a long life from the heads, do not buy many cartridges for on-hand spares. It quits rather quickly and in a matter of days its all over. I emptied most of the cartridges trying to clean the heads, only white paper during printing. Mine did print yellow before the cartridge got nearly empty. Goodbye Epson C82, I feel like shipping it to Epson collect one way........ Oh yes, the HP 5550 is very good, prints very fast in draft quality (uses little ink) and good enough if you need to do a lot of printing with text and photos. Excellent photos on glossy paper with the photo cartridge."
1,"OK, when it works",I bought my original C82 mid 2003 from amazon.com. Around the beginning of 2004 the printer stopped working. I would only print blank pages and all the nozzle checks and head cleaning in the world wouldn't fix it. I even changed the ink cartridges to no avail. I called tech support and they sent me a new C82. Well that one just died (Nov. 2004) and when I called Epson they told me they only warranty their exchanges for 30 days. I was mad to say the least. I went through their hoops and finally got someone to exchange it for a different model. Definitely do some research on the web before even thinking about buying this model.
1,What good is a printer that doesn't print?,"If you are going to buy this printer make sure you use it often. It seems as if you don't do that, the ink on the nozzles dries up and then you won't be able to print anything. Also, the printing quality degrades quickly with light use. On a positive but non-redeeming note, I never had a paper jam with it."
2,GREAT....while it lasted,"I bought this just over a year ago in 2003, and today, my printer heads clogged up permanetly. I cleaned them about 10 times, but that didn't solve the problem. What happened was my black and cyan cartridges were almost empty so I went to AAFES and bought a new black ($29.95) and cyan ($9.95) cartridge. I come home to replace them and installed them. I printed and all that printed was magenta and yellow!! The monitor showed the black and cyan were full!! So now, I go to test with old cartridges to see if I was sold an old cartridge, but my magenta just ran out b/c of all the cleaning. I looked on Epson's site and the owners troubleshoot manual and FOUND NOTHING that solved the problem. I also read other people's printer heads are worn out. I bought this printer for $149.00 from AAFES (Army & Air Force Exchange Service). It did produce great prints, but I bet yours will last about a year or two. Have fun fixing it!!"
1,Ink guzzler,"I keep checking the interior of the C82, waiting to see a big ink spill, because the printer is constantly running of out ink. I rarely print color --about once every two months. The machine shuts down because of ""empty"" ink cartridges even though there is plenty of ink left. Frustrating and expensive! I've spent a fortune replacing ink cartridges, yes, Epson brand. Do not buy this printer! At any price!"
2,Clogged ink nozzle,"The Epson C82 was fabulous when it worked. The black ink nozzle (the one I use the most) is now clogged and I have only owned it for 3 months. I am still within warranty, but I don't want the hassle of sending it to the manufacturer. I'm trying to clean the nozzle myself with isopropanol. Considering the many other complaints about clogged Epson nozzles, I would think twice about buying this printer."
2,Not up to par,"This ink-hog printer worked moderately well until I had to replace the ink tanks after which the print quality was so poor that I replaced the machine with a Canon i560. And, yes, I did use Epson replacement tanks. Be aware that Durabrite inks do not print on glossy photo paper. This is a plain or matte paper only machine. If it had not been a special offer ($50 rebate) I wouldn't have purchased it. As it is now, it has become a piece of electronics for recycling taking up space in my home office closet."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE,"This hunk of junk earns 1 star for performing decently... up until it required an ink cartridge change. We changed the ink as directed, and [it] stopped working. Cold. Didn't matter what we did, how many times we instructed the printer to run its cleaning mode, or print the sample page. Nothing worked. It simply went toes up.Folks, Epson makes garbage, stay away!"
1,Dead after a year ...,"Decent printer for the price, while it lasts. After about a year of moderate use, the print head cleaner ink hose broke. This is apparently a VERY common failure mode for this printer. It's inspired multiple forum posts and some websites about repair. The repair required partial disassembly of the printer and a whole lot of ink everywhere. A lot of trouble to ressurect a mediocre printer. Go with a Canon or HP instead of this lemon."
1,Clogged print head,"The print quality of the C82 is superb. But, the C82 has the print head built-in rather than part of a new cartrige. What that means is that WHEN the print head dries it will clog rendering the printer useless. Repair costs almost as much as the printer itself. Use Epson cartridges, follow the installation directions to the tee and you still can get a print head clog, air bubbles in the cartridge, I was told. Do an Internet search on 'Epson C82 not printing' and you will meet those who have already bought the C82. Epson's recommendation to me was to buy new cartridges, $60, then a cleaning kit, $10, that and a lot of my time. Next printer will have the print head and cartidge as one piece."
2,skj,I have had this noisy printer for a year. Actually this is the replacement printer the first 82c cratered after less then 6mo. It has problems with banding. My HP 882c after 4 years of flawless printing had to go to the shop and will cost more to repair then what a new HP will cost. I read all the reviews on this printer and thought it sounded like what I needed an all around printer for text and photo's. Text is good photo's come out with banding more times then not. It's not my camera or the software. I noticed that the C82 isn't on the market anymore. Gee wonder why???!!!!
1,Mine is broken too,"After about 18 months mine does not print at all. Like many others, I just wasted $70 on new cartridges only to find I'm going to throw them out with the printer."
1,This printer is junk!!!,My dad bought this printer at Best Buys last year. It stopped wotrking yesterday and the light doesnt even come on. He's mad because he bougth a lot of ink for it and now we can't use it.
2,Disappointing,"I find it quite difficult to load paper or envelopes so that the paper or envelope grabs hold when loaded. I spend a lot of time ""fooling"" with the paper to get the printer to accept it.I also do not like having to take out the paper to put in an envelope and then to put the paper back in to print the letter. My old Lexmark allowed me to keep the paper in the feeded and to insert the envelope or a single sheet of paper in the manual feed in front of the paper tray. It was much easier to work with."
3,Be Warned,"This is a great printer. It's fast with text and prints beautiful pictures. However, ink is CRAZY expensive. Thirty-plus dollars for a cartridge (that doesn't last overly long) is quite frustrating and makes it impossible for me to recommend this machine."
1,Bad experience,"I used this printer about 1 year after I bought it. While it works the prints are good, but it died with clogged heads.In my family this is the second C82 to do this. The other one lasted not even a year.Can't recommend buying this device at all."
1,Epson is a total ripoff,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER OR ANYTHING FROM EPSON!!!!!!!! I brought this printer as a bundle from Dell (thanx for the heads upDell). I ended up sending it back not once but 3xs for printing problems. No matter how many times i did the nozzle check and cleaning, my pages still came out with the streaking lines throughout the page. Let's not talk about the price of the ink practicallly $75.00 believe me it is not worth it. This thing is a piece of crap. I'm going with HP after this . HEED THIS WARNING!!!!!!!"
2,C82 Mishaps - Don't let it sit too long without printing,"Had mine for almost 18 months. At month 5 started experiencing the ""dry outs"" that others mention. At first a quick change of the lowest level ink would help if head cleaning didn't work. (that's $15-18 for each cartridge changed). It finally got to the point that if the printer sat idle for 10 days or more, all 4 inks would clog. Repeated efforts at head cleaning did not help. As it is the colored inks are expensive when you buy sets. Went back to HP, this time the 5150. Along with my HP 952C and HP 5110, I am very happy once again. Fewer component inks to buy and reliable everytime."
2,Yet more disappointment,"Sadly, this review echoes that of so many others here.I've just spent 10 minutes trying to get paper to feed into the printer for a simple one page print-out - never does go on the first try - and started to go look for possible solutions. I'd guess we've printed less than 40 sheets in 6 months - it's just so cranky. Once the paper finally feeds, it usually works fine from there. Something in turning it off and back on for the next print fouls the feeding.Secondly - I've never gotten anything reasonable for printing photo-quality on photo paper. It's always very gritty. Sadly, printing on plain paper usually comes out better - despite trying nearly every combination of ""paper setting"" for the photo paper.I bought this printer through Office Depot - they jerked me around selling me different paper and offering advice until I ran out of warranty. No return, despite the initial problem I reported was 2 days after purchase."
1,very bad printer,"piece of junk... loading the paper is extremely noisy, printing could be quieter also... after few months heads will get clogged... soon the problem gets worse. it totally died on me after 15 months... overpriced toner. colors doesn't match at all, needs lot of calibrating with poor results.* i just replaced it with canon i860 first impressions are superior and sophisticated inkjet. fast and quiet, colors are brilliant. never buy epson."
2,I'm suprised I'm not alone,"I am looking for a printer after my C82 died and found there are many people have the same problem like mine. I agree the C82 has a resonalbe quality but that wouldn't last long. The last thing I want to see is it's head cleaning. It sucks your ink! I recently bought a black and spent one fifth to clean the printing-head. I had a headache! Bye, my poor C82."
1,Epson C82 Dies After Changing Ink Cartridge,"I bought my Epson C82 last year and was very pleased with the quality of prints. It has been used regularly but not heavily, and I have used only genuine Epson ink cartridges. A few weeks ago, the black cartridge indicated ""low"" and I bought a new supply of ink cartridges - two of each colour as I always like to have a spare on hand. To my surprise, when I replaced the black cartridge, the printer stopped printing. I ran the nozzle-cleaning process several times, thereby using up the yellow cartridge which I then also replaced. I thought the cartridges must have been defective, but the technician is telling me that the print head is bad. Just so? Now that I've seen the hundreds of bad reviews on Amazon and in fixyourownprinter.com I realize that I bought a lemon and then wasted a lot of money on ink cartridges. What a let-down from a company that I used to believe in."
5,"Great printer-don't waste time thinking about it,-buy it!",This is a great printer. I love it and you can't beat the price. It meets all my needs and I love that it shows me how much ink is left in each of the color banks. I also like that I can purchase the ink separately. A lot of folks warned of the printer being loud. This is a true assessment but it's not annoying and worth what you get overall. The printer is fairly fast. I work in IT and have to say that this printer is well worth the price!!
3,small tracks,"I have a specific problem with my new c82, and I will bet that if other people check they will find the same. There are three toothed wheels above the outfeed slot on the printer. On my printer these wheels leave very small tracks all the way across the image. I just got the printer today, and have yet to contact epson about this apparent design flaw. I am still an epson fan, but I don't think that this printer prints quite as well as my epson 880 that just died."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this printer just over 2 year ago. Within 1 year it stopped printing completely. Epson said perhaps the ink was bad, so i bought new set of ink and it did not help. Luckily it was under warranty so they replaced it.Within another year, it works only sometimes. If i do not print for 2-3 week, it .just does not print. I have gone through so many head cleaning - sometimes after 6-7 time (lots of ink wasted) it would function. So I would think it is ok - buy anothers set of ink and go through this every month! I have finally come to my sense, this is just a crappy printer. I ma going to take this printer in my back yard and take a sledge hammer to it.Will never buy Epson again!"
1,Worse printer you can buy!,"I wouldn't even give this printer one star if the option was there. I just bought all new cartridges and have used half of them trying to get it to print. Have run dozens of head cleaners and still nothing. I don't feel too bad about the printer cause I got it fairly cheap but I'm upset over the expense of my cartridges. My suggestion to anyone looking at these....stay as far away as you can....buy a printer that has the printhead in the ink cartridge...at least then all you are out is the price of one cartridge, not the whole printer....I'm going back to my faithful HP's or just might give the Canon's a shot."
1,Liked it while it worked.,When I first got this printer it was noisy but I loved it. Then the first time the ink dried out the print head clogged and no amount of cleaning cycles would fix it. Even with new ink it still only prints blank pages. My next printer I wll definately go back to HP.
2,I thought I found the best...,"I loved the C82. I had it for about 18 months and made tons of great pictures, and then something began to change. First the colors began getting striped... so I followed the maintenance and everything was well with the world.Until one fateful day when the blue stopped printing. Thinking the cartridge was low, I changed it. Nothing happened. Then after cleaning the nozzles a few times, and trying again, I had to change another color cartridge. Then that one wouldn't print either. Slowly but surely, they all went. Now I am printer-less. That is bad and I am so disappointed.I am also amazed at how many other people have the same problems. I loved this printer when it was working... but now, bye-bye Epson."
1,junk junk junk -,"just replaced all color ink cartidges - now none of the color print heads work. i owned an epson stylus 720 back in 1995 - it was also junk and I swore i would never buy an epson printer again. my next printer was an HP Deskjet 722C - the best printer ever - good color, low ink useage, indestructable - then HP ceased support of the original win98 driver - for win2k the driver was a generic piece of trash - no more good color, etc. then i saw the C82 on sale in 2003 - i thought 8 years might be enough for epson to get their act together - apparently i was mistaken. I think i might send this one back to epson with a pile of dog doo in it and a note that reads ""keep the change""boycott epson printers"
3,"It's a good printer, until it breaks","I had this printer for one year and three weeks. I liked it a lot and used it often but one day it stopped printing ink. Something was wrong with the printer head. I brought it in to someone to look at it. At first they thought the printer head was clogged and needed to be cleaned but it was worse than that. I was quoted prices to fix it but fixing would of cost the same as a new printer. The only horrible part to was dealing with the Epson people. It seems that because it broke three week after the one year mark there was nothing! they could do about it. Oh, except recommed a service center for me to take it to. What a joke."
2,Another Disappointed Owner,"I purchased this model on the recommendation of my father-in-law who normally has great computer advice, but this time he sure didn't. This is one of the worst printers I've owned. I have not had it long enough for the ink jets to get clogged, but from the other reviewers say, I can't wait! Even when it was new the paper feed was completely frustrating. You'd think I was trying to force feed a three year old castor oil, not feed paper into a printer. 80% of my print efforts have required me to fiddle with the paper to get it to go in and begin printing.I'm just a basic home user. I don't ask much of a printer, but even what little I expect this Epson fails to deliver. I used to think highly of the Epson brand. I'll look elsewhere next time. So should you!"
2,The blue print nozzle clogged,"A bought the C82 because I wanted a printer compatible with Linux. This one is Linux compatible and I have no complaints in that regard.The problem is that the blue print nozzle clogged and no amount of running the ""head cleaning"" utility has had any effect. I had the same problem on an Epson 640 that this printer replace. I am beginning to wonder if there is a design flaw in the Epson print heads that make them succeptible to print head clogging or if it is ink related. In any case I would not recommend this printer for color printing or for that matter Epson color ink jet printers in general. They clog."
1,I'll add my voice to the chorus of the disgruntled,"Look below and you'll see page after page of negative reviews; these people are not exaggerating.In virtually every case the reviews are the same: it works fine at first, starts to hiccup at 6 mos., belches and coughs at 12 months--and six months later it drops dead. There's nothing you can do to bring it back; it's really gone!Not only is the C82 a waste of money, it massively tries your patience. Every time you look at it you'll want to sock it in the nose.Buy some other company's printer."
1,Only Lasted 18 Months,"Heads clogged up. Tried the cleaning cycle several times and new expensive ink cartridges. Didn't work. Called Epson, Tech support on the phone after warranty expires is $9.95. Sent them an e-mail explaining the problem and what I had done .... their reply >>> 'try the cleaning cycle and/or new ink cartridges'! That's it Epson, I'm going with a HP laserjet."
2,WARNING!!! Clogged Heads,"Apart from the speed and plain paper sharpness, this printer has too much going AGAINST it.Colors are dull on glossy paper, smudge-free inks are NOT smudge-free.And here's the Biggie, this printer clogged all heads after about one year, even during regular usage with EPSON OEM inks.This is my third and LAST Epson printer; previously I had a 850 and C80. All died with CLOGGED Printheads.I think this is Epson's way to get you to trade-up, but I am switching brands this time around."
2,Cumbersome Candle,"At first glance, this candle has a lot going for it. In particular, it is interesting looking and self-extinguishing. It is, however, also cumbersome to use and messy. The coil is less pliable than it needs to be for ease of use while candle drippings coat the coiled candle and/or fall to the ground for a messy clean-up task. I have not used it enough to know whether it is as effective as other citronella candles but suspect that its modest size may limit its effectiveness."
3,"Long lasting, nice smell... but it's not ""New Car"" scent","These little ""pine trees"" truly pack a lot of scent in them and each package does last a few weeks.I bought these when my car lost that pleasant new car scent, and was looking for something to prolong the sensation.One thing that buyers should be aware of (and the manufacturer should take note of) is that this product smells nothing like ""new car scent"". The scent is quite pleasant indeed but it smells kindda ""frutty"" and ""sweet"". It resembles perfume a whole lot more than it ever did ""new car"" scent.I just haven't been able to find a ""new car scent"" air freshner that smells like a new car. Maybe they're just not able to replicate it. If anyone finds a product that does, please let me know!"
1,Not as Advertised,"If you like the smell of perfume, this is just the product for you. I am not sure what kind of new car these guys used as an example, but it sure wasn't any new car that I have been in."
4,A Good Live ELP Album,"This is a good chance to hear some live ELP from the late 90's. There aren't many official releases of live ELP from this stage in the band's history. The sound quality is good, and the band plays some of the usual hits, along with the ever-changing 20 minute medley they seem to reinvent for each tour. Some live albums can sound over-produced, almost like a studio album, but this one doesn't. Listening to it, it feels like you're there in the concert hall. Carl Palmer has a cool drum solo too, and Keith Emerson is the usual Man-Of-A-Thousand-Sounds. They don't have quite the exuberance they did in the 70's, but they still have a lot of energy and they're fun to listen to."
5,Classic(al) Rock from the Iconic Trio,"The recorded live show from June 1997 in Katowice, Poland, has had a trio of releases; as a bootleg in 1997, an official release in Austria in 2001 and a wider release in 2003. But no matter the format it is a remarkable display of the incredible artistry of the progressive rock icons.Relying heavily on older material - along with a pair of cuts from the offshoot group; Emerson, Lake & Powell - this is not simply a band revisiting past glory by rumbling through a familiar set of songs....there are re-arrangements that are subtle and impressive, while bringing new power and freshness to the music. And there is solo space for each artist to add impressive brush strokes to the colorful canvas that has added touches from an appreciative audience.This is an impressive performance that shows the trio remained on top of their game and striving to deliver excellence, while bringing renewed relevance to the inclusion of key elements of classical music into rock."
5,STELLAR!,"What can I say, I have been listening to underOATH for a long time now. My favorite album was Cries of the Past but this has surpassed that definitely! Love it, especially ""In Regards to Myself""!"
5,I'm Not Really a Fan of UnderOath,"But I am now, this is so much better then that overly poppy They're All Chasing Safety. This one is kind of like Norma Jean with Keith Buckley from Every Time I Die on vocals."
5,Underoath Finally Hits the Perfect Chord,"Well, this was the third Underoath purchase I made... And surprisingly the most satisfying.Obviously, I've liked what I've heard from Underoath's previous efforts (or I wouldn't have kept buying the CDs.) What I LOVE about DGL is it's careful attention to message and truth. Hearing a worshipful Psalm ""Salmanir"" quoted smack in the middle of the album was a plus. I also love the deep philosophy that Underoath has decided to start pouring into their lyrics. These aren't your typical ""drugs are bad!"" lyrics. These are well thought out, VERY Christian lyrics that have to do with everything from confessing your faults one to another, to the perspective we gain through hardship and mortality.The sound is very heavy, but somehow deeply encouraging and pumping. So, Underoath remains firmly in my roster of Christian hardcore that is actually great.Enjoy!"
4,HEAVY,"I like many christian metal bands they are heavy but who cares if they are christian i mean some christian band's are heavier than none christian bands.Underoath is a band that many people say they have sweet sounds probably when he's singing in clean vocals but the screams are brutal and loud this album is one you should check out.I haven't heard any of their early stuff but i heard it was kind of grindcore but with a different singer.You may make fun of this band just cause they are christian but they are heavy,get this album the screams and sounds are awesome!"
5,Heavier than the last two.,"before Underoath released The Changing of Times and Theyre only chasing saftey The were much heavier, almost being death metal. than, The Changing of Times was released and the they became less heavy, more alternative and emo. while i liked Theyre Only Chasing Safety a lot, this record is much better, because it retains the vocal style of recent times (the hardcore screams mixed with clean emo singing) and keyboards, but is much heavier, almost back to their early, Act of Depression era. if you havent heard Act of Depression, check it out now. any way, while it is heavier, the riffs are more complicated and interesting than before. the album is packed with an incredible amount of energy and force, and while the lyrics and vocals are great, the instrumentation is absolutley fantastic. the songs could all be instrumental, but the album would still be worth it. this is highly recommended."
3,informative,the book was informative and helped me better understand why gas prices were going up in my state.
2,Wrong watch was sent.,"I carefully shopped for this watch. Called Invicta and was told that this watch that did not have the number 9310 (but began with 98xxx) had a Automatic Swiss Movement. It is my third Invicta watch. It did not have a automotic Swiss movement. In fact, it was a battery operated movement. The crystal was chipped, and I was so disgusted, I discarded the watch.I ordered another (different style)with an automatic (Japanese 21 Jewel) movement. It works fine and is a great watch for the price.Very disappointed with this shipment and the seller for the deception. I could have gone to J.C. Penney and purchased the same watch for a couple of dollars more.Lesson learned: Be careful and look at the detailed description of the watch. The movement is sometimes listed in a way that you really don't know what you're getting unless you call.Joe Puliti"
1,Horrible experience,"I bought this watch as a short term replacement while my Citizen was being repaired. This watch is horrible. The crown is not screw down, as advertised and it constantly pulls out. As a result I'm always loosing time and changing the date. I cannot rely on it to keep time because of the crown issue. Since I am a nurse and have to keep track of patient medication times, functionality is mandatory! Good grief. It is a watch after all. When I looked at having it fixed under warranty, the Invicta company wants $28.00 just for S&H; to look at it. Yes - you get to send them $28 just to get the defective watch fixed under warranty!Oh, and you may wonder why I simply did not return it? Once it has been worn, it is not returnable. Which is interesting as how is someone going to determine if the watch is defective unless it is worn?Needless to say, this is my last ever Invicta purchase."
5,Excelent::!,"Once I arrived, I could not believe, much like the Rolex Submariner, the enecantó my wife, my mother and brothers were surprised by its low cost and high quality noticeable. High quality finish. Some friends are envious, it is a watch that gives class and imposes imposes on other more expensive brands. The pulse was faacil suit my thick wrist, however I took it to a professional jeweler to do the job, only cost me 5,000 pesos Colombian, something like $ 2.5. I am very happy and I love that in the dark when you can see by the luminosity of the hands and points.The only thing I do not like is the light that is lost teimpo desdepués of true light outside. Then you need to place it in a short time frame to direct light so you can see in the dark after.But overall it's a magnificent watch and I'm very glad I bought on Amazon :::!"
3,A good looking watch but slightly off in the movement,"Hello,I received a Invicta Men's 9310 Pro Diver Collection Swiss Quartz Watch indeed, but the watch was not as pictured on Amazon's site.It was missing the gold spot on the back plate, as mine was silver, and the links connecting the watch body to the band seemed too loose. I never did take the watch packaging off, I suspected I received something slightly different, since the second hand movement seemed to hit the mark in the middle of the second marks instead of the second marks on the dial themselves. Watch was received on Saturday, seller was not available on Saturday to clarify what it was that I did receive, so this was returned for a refund, of which I am still waiting for.I am going to try a purchase of a different Invicta watch all together FYI."
3,Nice Watch; but Over-rated by some...,"Invicta watches seem to get a lot of hype; and I suspect some reviews are ""questionable"" in some way. My watch keeps good time; the box was impressive; I've had it for almost a year and wear it two or three days a week. Quality is good for it's cost, so I would rate it a good value. Mine is Quartz, not a self-winding automatic as some reviewers suggest. The crystal is pretty good, I have few scratches. But people; this can't be compared with a Rolex, or Tag! Would I buy it again or buy another; yes. Would I be upset if it were stolen; as my Rolex was years ago; NO. The crown screw action is ""weak"" for DST adjustments. Kept in perspective; overall it's an OK $75-$80 watch."
2,Not so good,"I have a 1965 Riviera, I bought this to see if it would do anything to condition the non leather seats,it did not. I used it several times and got a little sheen on the seats but I really don't think there is any product that will really restore non leather material."
5,Perfection,This faucet is perfection. The finish is wonderful and shoes no stress after being installed early a year. I highly recommend Delta projects.
1,Restocking Fee Delta Lavatory Faucet,"Shame on me for not reading the return policy first, so I'll know better next time. I understand a restocking fee, but 25%. Ridiculous. I won't be ordering from this supplier again. Lesson learned the hard way. The product appeared to be fine, but because I returned it without even removing from the box, I can't speak about quality of the product."
5,Riveting!,"John Thinnes gets assigned a new partner, Don Franchi. And although he specializes in homicides, he gets assigned to the case of a serial rapist. He hates working on rape cases and he hates working with his new partner--a woman with a real bad in-your-face attitude. And the pressure mounts when the serial rapist becomes a killer. Thinnes turns to Jack Caleb once again, hoping for insight to find the killer before he kills again.This tightly written story will keep you reading and riveted to your seat. I liked the bristling relationship between Thinnes and Franchi, an interesting and complex new character. The denouement was unexpected, exciting, and satisfying. It's been too long of a wait for another book from Ms. Dymmoch but it was worth it! I can't wait to read the next book.Also recommended: Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski series, Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado series, Barb D'Amato's Cat Marsala series"
5,A compelling read,"Chicago Detective Thinnes specializes in homicides until he's assigned a rape case & a new partner, who happens to be a female with an attitude. This allows for some splendid sexist sparring among fellow cops & some hoary old gender apartheid jokes being tossed around like grenades.THE FELINE FRIENDSHIP is more than just a good mystery, it is a handbook on what rape is, how it affects the victims, the men & women who must seek justice for the crime, as well as our familiesMichael Allen Dymmoch's style is short, simple & compelling, I could not put it down! A complex tale of power in the work place & why men rape."
3,Not as Good as the Sci-Fi Guide,"Of the guides, this one is the weaker of the two. For one, Barlowe seems to pick his subjects at random...we see monsters that had minor roles in the various books where they were portrayed (and thus, we probably didn't have a burning interest to see what they looked like if they were minor characters in the books). There's quite a few human subjects in this one as well...and they seem out of place here, as some of them are rather plain (okay, so maybe the golem did look like the Pillsbury Dough Boy...but why put him in the book?). There's also several shape shifters, which Barlowe illustrates by showing them in ""mid-form"", which doesn't tell us much about what they really look like. If anything, Barlowe's work competes with itself -- I was spoiled by his Science Fiction guide and this one, while definitely a beautiful addition to any collector's shelf, simply cannot match the detail of that book."
5,The Next Generation comes into its own,"I read the first installment of Sherryl Woods' ""And Baby Makes Three"" series, so I was very excited to see the next generation up for some romance. As usual, Ms. Woods does not disappoint. Readers get to revisit the Adams of the first series--meddling, as usual--AND enjoy seeing their children find their way through their own romantic entanglements. Passion and humor are well balanced, and Ms. Woods pays very careful attention to each character's history. For instance, Dani's relationship with Duke's twin boys is all the more poignant because of her status as a stepchild. Looking forward to pairing off the rest of the family!"
2,Not the soundtrack - but a complete True Grit recording soon,"This album was ""never"" the original soundtrack recording but a disc of outlandishly ""commercial"" arrangements of thematic material from the film score. It therefore remains something of an oddity. Those wanting a faithful rendition of Elmer Bernstein's score wil be pleased to note that a recording of the entire score - every note of it - has now been made utilising the original manuscripts - with the original orchestrations by Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes - and is due for release on the Tadlow Music label in June 2006."
2,Actual Score Available Elsewhere,"Some of the score is available recorded by Bernstein on a compilation recording he made in the 80's of his John Wayne western scores. Originally 2 albums, I belive it is now available on 1 CD. A digital recording from the original score has appeared recently, though not conducted by Bernstein."
2,overrated,The hype over this book is overrated. I love the australian bush and have knowledge of the species discussed but the content didn't do anything for me. The plot was tedious and the descriptions of the eucalypts were poor and boring. Where was the majesty of the bush? where was the feeling of crispness and friability? I truly don't know why this book won the Prime Ministers Literary award.
2,A series of half-baked vignettes held together by a thread,"It can't be a good sign when you finally give up on a book 30 pages from the end. This book proves, like a John Fowles novel, that the writer holds all the cards. Give a reader a half-interesting tale to follow and they will follow because they want to know what happens in the end. Unfortunately, Bail doesn't come close to Fowles' skill as a story-teller.As other reviewers here have pointed out, the story -- if you can call it that -- seems to be little more than an endless series of half-baked vignettes that hang together only in the loosest sense of the word. They are meant to be evocative, or illustrative, of the central romance at the heart of the novel, but in the end they are just tiresome. One ends up feeling that the author structured the novel this way because he was too lazy to create a coherent and compelling whole."
3,Trees are the characters,"A nice fairytale set in Australia, unfortunately the main participants are not of the human kind, they're trees and you will learn so many names of different Eucalypts that by the end of it you do not want to hear the word Eucalyptus for a very long time. Don't get me wrong, the main characters really are humans but the book is also very much about trees."
4,Good story,"Got a bit wordy at times, come on and get to your point. But if you love descriptions and a good story, this is great."
5,"So many short storys, in a beautifully written novel","A very deep deception, by a extremely talented and courageous author. The deception is in the author's knowledge of the gum tree, and the weaving of this knowledge to create an understanding of the people that the country that these species adapt and thrive, also adapt and survive.. loved it!!"
3,magical but unfocused,"The book certainly had a magical quality about it, with the isolated setting of a private ranch, all the eucalyptus trees, the stories told by the mysterious stranger. I actually enjoyed all the botanical information about eucalyptus trees, as I have never considered them before.However, I didn't fully understand where the story went. The father seemed a likeable enough character, but why did he impose such an impossible task to secure the marriage of his daughter-it seemed a draconian measure for someone who obviously loved her and would have wanted to see her happy. I wasn't sure what kind of person the daughter was and didn't have much personal feeling for her. I'm not sure how sympathetic I felt towards her- could she not have done more to avoid the fate imposed upon her by her father?All in all, I enjoyed some of the fantasy-like qualities of the book, but felt it was unfocused in the message it was trying to put across."
2,Hmm....,"I guess if you want to enjoy this novel, you must read it as a fairytale. I had the most trouble believing 1) Ellen's father could get all the Eucalyptus species successfully growing on his property and 2)The surreal descriptions of the trees, which from a poetic perspective, are the best part of the story .In the end, I didn't like this novel. The ending was unresolved, anticlimaxed and irrelevant to the flow of the rest of the story. This is one novel where the trees are given far more poetry, colour and life than the 'wooden' human characters. I guess it's only right then that Nic Kidman will be playing the female lead the the cinematic adaptation."
5,A beautiful story,"This is a book worth reading. It pulls you along and the spare prose of the author works wonders to bring the whole story to life. The juxtaposition of the ordinary and the concrete with the imaginary and the abstract is mesmerizing. Read it, preferably sitting in the sparse shade of a eucalypt."
2,A message.,"I gave this to my grandmother as a gift. After her death, it found its way back to me. Inside the front cover was a note stating: This is the most boring book I have ever read. I then read the book, thinking that with my fancy university education and all that I was bound to experience it differently. I'm afraid it didn't work for me either."
3,"Disappointing as a romance, but interesting about trees!","Seduced by the rave reviews and awards that this book has gathered, it was with the anticipation of a great read that I began the story. I am sorry to report that it is a difficult read and even though I perservered until the end I am still unsure how our heroine fares. The interspersing of information about Australia's great trees is interesting enough, but not enough for me to rate this book more highly. I was very disappointed."
1,This thing is pure junk,"It prints grainy when it does not misfeed. It has a terrible time feeding any decent photo paper beyond 5x7 or using the main tray. It uses ink like a junky. It is extremely slow. They spent too much effort on silly features and not enough on a good feed system. It doesn't even accurately print CD's and DVD's. but rather misses the center point continuously. I would not purchase this ""toy"" again."
2,Doesn't print on CD's in Vista,"Nice printer if you have Windows XP. Unfortunately, HP still hasn't update the software so you can print directly on a cd if you have Windows Vista. Don't buy this item if you have Vista. HP won't even respond anymore after asking them for a year to update their software."
1,Worst HP printer I have ever used.,This thing is junk. I had purchased this printer mainly for it capabilities to print on CD/DVDs. When loading CDs into the provided tray it scathes the bottom of the CD. And if your lucky enough to get it to print on the to of the CD it does a good job of scratching that too. Provided software is a joke. I can't fathom why a print driver would be so large and take so long to install.
1,CD/DVD adapter scratches discs,"This is a pretty package - it looks pretty, prints pretty, acts pretty. I bought it mainly for use in printing directly onto CDs and DVDs. Out of the 25 or so DVDs I've printed (using Maxell inkjet printable DVD-Rs), less than half of them have worked. (They look great, don't get me wrong.) But the CD/DVD adapter definitely scratches the discs and in the majority of cases, renders them useless. This was a waste of money. I should have gone with my instincts and bought the Epson instead."
1,Don't waste your time or money,This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. There is not one iota of originality in it. It is tedious and utterly uninspired. I literally threw my copy out after viewing it once.
3,You get what you pay for.,"As other reviewers have noted, this printer is noisy and consumes the expensive ink cartridges quickly. Most of my printing needs are for plain black-and-white text, and I think the quality of its output is just adequate. I liked the price and the ease of installation, but I kind of wish I had gone ahead and repaired my old HP 820Cse.I wrote this review in March 2003. It is now October 2006 and this printer is still going strong. I take back all the nasty things I said about it."
5,Excellent printer,This is an excellent injet printer for the price..it prints beautiful pictures in no time
1,Epsom is a disreputable company,"Read Mark Whitney's review again (Hollywood,Ca.) he says it well. I'd like to send a copy of that to the CEO of EPSOM because his letter says it all. Epsom should be ashamed, but what do they care, their greed for $$ is more important than customer service. I had a C 62 Epsom Printer for 4 months. When it broke I called customer service. I have never heard such a display of incompetence and rudeness.My advice is don't deal with this company or their products. They are disreputable. D. LakeMaine"
2,Ok printer that drinks ink like crazy,"I bought the C62 about a year ago and am now looking for a new printer that won't constantly be running out of ink. To make it worse, the printer gets a little low on ink and then refuses to print anything until you install new cartridges. Print quality, ease of use, etc is fine, but that should be the case with any printer. I have an HP 880c at work that seems to go forever on a set of cartidges, so I'll be shopping for an HP this time."
2,Not a reliable printer!!,"Along with the previous reviews, I am unsastified with the quality with this printer. WARNING: this printer will not print if the COLOR cartridge runs out (even if you still have a full cartridge of black ink)!!Pros: Nice design, compact,Cons: The start-up time it takes is slow, the printing proccess is average/slow, consumes a lot of ink, printing quality is average,"
2,My Epson Stylus 740 gives me better quality pictures.,"I just bought this printer from a local store because of price, bonus and rebate. The salesman said it would be better than what I have. It does not compare to my Epson Stylus Color 740 in photo quality. The test photos on the C62 are fuzzy and face color is off. I printed out a greeting card I just recently did on my 740 and the picture was better but not worth going and buying this printer. The resolution might not be there with my 740 but the clarity, quality, and color are so much better."
1,Terrible printer,"This printer is so bad. Clogs all the time, I have almost never had a good quality print. Cartridges are very expensive and don't last. You can't use 3rd party cartridges because of embedded chip technology.This will be the last Epsom printer I ever own. I am going to junk it and look for an alternative."
1,Not A Good Printer,"Doesn't work if the color cartridge runs out. Poor print quality. Loud, Slow. Ink runs out very fast. I usually buy HP's and this was my first Epson. NEVER AGAIN!"
3,a bargain for me,"About a year ago,our Best Buy had these for $39 each. This included the ink cartridges that come with the new printer. When I asked the salesman why the cheap price--less than the value of the ink cartridges alone--she wasn't sure but thought it was because they were being discontinued at Best Buy. I bought three of them.I like Epson products for photo printing,and this one,in spite of its low price,produces good photo-quality results. The only problem,which would have bothered me a lot if I hadn't gotten the printers free,has been the frequently recurring need to do the nozzle cleaning procedure--more often than with models I've previously owned. But at this price,who's complaining. I was amazed to see that the currently listed price is as high as it is,and really thought it was a discontinued model by now."
4,BIG GREG,"I not an expert on printers ,but the Epson C62 is just right for me.If you are looking for a printer that does all basics just fine,then this is a excellent choice. I have read reviews that said this printer was noisy, I found it rather quiet compared to my old Canon BJC 240L, I'm not trying to win any awards with my photographs, so I'm very pleased with the job its done so far ,Then the best part you can purchase the Ink cartridges for around 6 Dollars each,color or black right here on Amazon."
2,Avoid unless free,This printer is in a word annoying. It loud and takes forever to actually begin to print a page. Once it begins to print it is not uncommon for it to get a paper jam. And the paper can be difficult to load if you have the printer in a spot where you can't clearly see the back. I wouldn't suggest going through any effort to buy this printer.
3,A Good Read for Christian Counselors,"The book is a required book for an elective graduate class that I am currently taking. If you are interested in Christian Counseling, it is a good book for you to read, because it presents the arguments on why it is an effective modality. If you aren't interested in Christian Counseling, it is going to show you some of the beliefs that Christian counselors have. It is a good book, but it is a little on the heavy side in terms of material."
1,Poor design and quality,"I like the Jeanie Rub massager but these accessories are flimsy and poorly designed. They fit poorly and worst of all, create a loud annoying rattling sound when the massager is used, especially at higher speeds. I returned this item. A note to those considering ordering from Pro Therapy Supplies: this seller charged a 10 percent restocking fee, claiming there is nothing wrong with this product. I will not be ordering from Pro Therapy Supplies in the future. Consider another seller if you are going to try this product in case you need to return it."
4,Behind Our Masks Lie....,"Francois Mauriac, winner of the 1952 Nobel Prize for Literature, turns here to an unusual plot device for him: murder. The fifty-something protagonist of 'The Mask of Innocence' is, on one level, akin to Wilde's fantasy character, Dorian Gray. Unlike Gray, however, Mauriac's suffering murderer is all too believable. She to be murdered is a wife who complicates his plans; the description of the murder itself is almost worthy of Dostoevski's in 'Crime and Punishment.' Yet the murderer alone takes pity on a country priest who is roundly ridiculed and hounded by 'christians' of the area. For Mauriac's best, try 'Viper's Tangle' or 'Woman of the Pharisees.' But if you love those, come back to this one. I've never read a Mauriac I didn't like and ponder for weeks afterward."
5,Helps my immune system!,"This product I have used to stop a sore throat as well as swollen glands right in their tracks. And I feel good using it because the ingredients are natural. It smells wonderful and I love using this to naturally sanitize my kitchen and other areas of my home that need it. If you need a boost in your immune system and want to stay germ-free like I do, please purchase this product. You won't be sorry!"
4,Great Find,"The ink is working great in my printer. I was skeptical at first since, I normally do not buy on line but, this is the only place I could find my ink that I needed. It is less expensive than the post exchange where I used to get it and works just as well. It is doing its job and I am about to order more."
2,Confusing,This is a rip off unless you know what you are doing. I asked a satellite guy if he understood it and he did not
2,Partial satisfaction,"DP44 switch worked fine for about 2 years which is nice but Power Incert never worked. I contacted seller who sounded wasn't intrested to hear my problem and he didn't say he will replace or refund. Any way after few contacts I gave up and worked around my other options, But power Insert was a fake or faulty one."
1,Bad Audio&Video Quality!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If u guys rlookin 4 something 'really',heavy,this is it!!!!But the audio&video quality is Mediocre,awesome bands on the setlist,cant ask 4 ne thing better,but dont xpect ne thing on the part of the audio&video(Unless u have a really good playa2 cover up 4 it),Id recomend Hellfest 2002 instead,which has 2discs and is way better than Hellfest 2000,Its got more content,plenty o interviews&lotsa otha stuff!!!!!!Dont waste your Money on this!!!!!!"
2,Leaves you thirsty for stats,"This isn't a bad book, unless of course, youre like me and want fielding stats for everyone, and hitting stats for pitchers. This book omits fielding stats for all but post-season. It also omits Sacriifice Hits and pitchers hitting stats. Go with the Major League Handbook if youre big into stats like I am."
1,CREDIBILITY QUESTIONED,"You Gotta Be Kidding! They Did It Again! The National Pasttime has a long, rich tradition of extraordinary literary coverage. However, no one has quite captured the essence of the great game of baseball...until now. Meet STATS All-Time Baseball Sourcebook, close to 9 lbs of pure magic. Bill James and John Dewan must have really had an epiphany to dream up this level of detail.If you thought the first monster, STATS All-Time Major League Handbook was good, this one really hits the target. At over 2500 pages, I doubt that you'll want to read this book in one sitting, however, I think it's a heck of an accomplishment and the guys and gals at STATS should really be proud of this one."
3,Shipping high,"I could not find ink locally for my printer. The ink is working fine on the printer. The price was great, but the shipping was high. But still cheaper than mail order from office supply stores."
4,Nice Dopp kit,"I bought 2 of these kits, one for my husband and one for my sons to share. It is a very nice dopp kit. The material is very nice and the travel kit it comes with is very nice. There is a lot of room, so you can pack everything neatly. The only problem I had was that one of the kits did not come with the travel kit accessories like it was suppose to. I called the company though and they refunded me half the cost of the kit. I was very pleased with their response and would not hesitate to purchase items from them in the future."
4,My son's favorite book at age 2,"When my son was 2, this was his favorite book for many months running, and he's not even a big cars fan, much more of a train fan! I think he liked it that the text was so simple and easy to cue by looking at the pictures. He memorized the whole thing very easily. The pictures are the kind that often appeal to young kids---very clear and standing out against white background. He especially liked it that the last page says ""say goodbye, car"" giving the book a clear ending."
1,And you wonder why jazz is not selling...,"People wonder why jazz is not selling. Just listen to this recording on BLUE NOTE!!! This guy has no consideration for the listener. He is so worried about being modern, that he has forgotten,(or never knew), music is for the PEOPLE... If this is the kind of stuff he wants to record, why release it on a major label? Average fans look to the labels to recruit the best. This recording falls far short of that goal. Just listen to 'Body and Soul' or 'Planet Rock'. You'll see...You've go to be modernistic.... nah.... You've got to be musicial."
5,This things shakes and Rocks,This was just what I was looking for...Great sound quality all features u wud want to have and the bass is just pounding...add the sexy spectrometer to that...this thing is irresistable
3,A wasted good idea,"The idea behind the story is good and evocative, but it isn't well developed. Worst, the last chapters seem as if written too quickly and make for an awkward ending."
1,Disappointing,"This novella starts out great, but Tucker loses the thread about the second chapter. He doesn't even time up all the loose ends. Looks like he ran out of steam!"
3,JVC Ear Clip Headphones w/ Retractable Cord,"Bought this for my mp3 player. I was really disappointed when I took this out of the box. Only one side of the headphones is retractable. It did not state in the description if both sides were retractable. I could not tell from the picture either. Whenever I put my mp3 player, with the headphones plugged into the player, into my purse the cord would sometimes get tangled whenever I took it out. My old headphones were retractable on both sides."
4,Media Burn,"The Media Burn footage is a must-see for anyone interested in performance art, or 1970s American Art."
1,Never shipped or even communicated!,"The terrible reseller never shipped or even communicated they were not going to ship, cut this clown off!"
1,Skip Avaya's Products,Anyone who purchases an Avaya product should get their head examined. They have all kinds of technical issues and the customer support is nonexistent. Save yourself a whole lot of frustration and just buy Cisco. Their products may still only be so-so but at least you can find someone to fix the problems.
2,"If you can, buy the original printing!","The vast majority of the people buying this book are probably buying it for class (like me) and have no say in the matter, so there's really no point in discussing the book itself. I will say, however, that if you need this book, look for a used copy of the first printing instead of one of these reprints. Pendragon scanned the original for this printing, and the plates of all the manuscripts you will probably need for your homework are much more clear in the original printing. Check the used market first."
5,A Great Book!,"My 8 year old son has Dyslexia and is reading at a first grade level. This book with it's minimum of pictures yet frequent site words that he knows makes him feel proud. At first when he saw all the words he said "" I can't read this"". When I showed him the first line and he knew the words he just took off from there. Last night he read 1 1/2 pages a total of about 150 words... it was a great accomplishment!"
5,ViewSonic continues it's dominance,"Since ViewSonic came into the picture (no pun intended), their 3 parrot logo has become a household name. Their monitors are what the rest of the industry is judged by.Oft copied, but never fully duplicated in quality, ViewSonic has another winner with the P90F. Not only is the on-screen image crisp and sharp, but the monitor itself detracts from the standard beige to off-white with a stunning Black and Silver ensemble.It's exterior appearance prepares you for a stunning display worthy of a professional graphics monitor. But it's very appealing price also will appeal to those gamers who paid for the graphics card and want a monitor to fully enjoy everything computer graphics has to offer.The P90F's bandwidth too, is high enough that one could run with Vertical-Sync always on, where once it was thought to be a performance sin.Kudos to ViewSonic. Keep up the good work."
2,Perfect digital pictures - text blurred!!!,"The monitor has great potential for displaying high quality pictures from digital camera. It was a great experience compared with my 6 y.o. Panasonic :) Superb colors, details, contrast - everything. But nothing is perfect - the text is sharp only at the left side of the display - the rest of it is blurred and makes it hard to look at. When I switch to 1280x1024 @85Hz (Recommended) the text is too blurred to work with. The clock at the bottom right has a reddish blurre! I'm going to call service center and ask them if they will repair/replace the unit. If not I will lower my rating to ""one star"" :( If the image on the new unit will be equally sharp I will raise it to 4 or even 5 stars and add some details about tested resolutions etc."
1,Quality problem,"I went through two monitors before Amazon stopped sending them due to widespread quality problems. The first was a complete blur. The second was bright and clear on the right side with a greenish tint on the left. The middle of the bottom bent upward and the upper left was a blur. I tried using the Viewsonic web site to resolve the issues. There is very little technical information on their site. I got an email after two days from Viewsonic tech support stating that the monitor was broken.I originally selected the monitor based on the technical specs which showed it to be one of the sharpest 19"" monitors on the market.The monitor looks great when it is turned off. Fortunately, the free shipping and return policy kept me from losing money on the deal. So, 5 stars to Amazon, 1 star to Viewsonic."
1,(...),"This film, together with ""Alexandra's Project"", has got to be the lamest excuse for promoting porn, under the banner of so-called art, that I have ever seen. This film has absolutely no substance, and the sex scenes are as erotic as a dog humping a pillow.This film has brought shame rather than praise to the Australian Film Industry."
4,On a mission to deliver: a letter written in 1177 by Pope Alexander III,"The participants in this mission, Nicholas Jubber and Mike Hirst set out to deliver a letter written by Pope Alexander III in 1177 to Prester John.On their journey to deliver (albeit 824 years late) Nicholas Jubber manages to combine historical knowledge and legend with contemporary reality in a way which is simultaneously eccentric, amusing and highly informative.There are a number of different journeys being depicted in this novel, and they are each worth reading about. Read it as a contemporary travelogue on a medieval mission, read it as a commentary on some of the issues that are as topical today as they were when the original 12th century missive was written. You choose!I recommend this to anyone with an interest in the legendary Prester John, as well as to anyone who likes reading about the travails of travel.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,Horrid,"This is a terrible book that could be a good book. The IDEA for the book was solid, and some of the historical tidbits are interesting.It COULD have been an entertaining quest, but there is one enormous problem: the author is a pretentious, self-centered, pseudo-intellecutal child with a very high opinion of himself and the most irritating writing style known to man. Don't waste your time with this book unless you enjoy being patronized.Shame."
5,A delightful book well worth reading!,"Flavio's story about growing up in New Mexico is funny andpoignant. As he describes childhood concerns such as family, friends,and school, the reader enters a world that is regrettably gone forever. It will make you laugh and cry. The awards that have been given this novel are well deserved! I am looking forward to another Floyd Martinez novel."
5,"Very funny, interesting,reads at several levels, high 9!","The book is set in a small village in Northern New Mexico where a young (adol.) Hispanic boy is torn between the lure of modern U.S. life and deep hispanic cultural values held by El Grande, his mountain man grandfather. It is rich in cultural conflict, adventure and at times very funny. Book is intended for young adults, but has much for everyone. Some spanish phrases but readily discernable from context. Has wide appeal regardless of culture/nationality. Book is readily available (not back ordered) from Arte Publico,1-800 633-ARTE, ISBN:1-55885-198-4, 192 pages"
5,"Excellent jobs by both the Director, Screenplay and Actors",Wonderful film for viewers who look for depth and meaning. Tornatore outdid himself while Polanski acted brillantly in this film.
4,An Excelent foreign film,"If you have the patients for sub-titles, you will love it. Very unpredictable, you'll never guess the end. And even after you know the end, the film still has ""rewatchability."""
5,An incredible look and twist on life.,"The camara work is excellent, and the colors are nothing less than brilliant. Depardieu does a wonderful job in this movie. It is a must see movie!!"
4,Great,"Any movie that keeps you guessing until the end, as this one does, has to be worth seeing. In addition, the possibility of such compassion, even redemption available to a wretched man after death leaves a sweet taste in the mouth. Loved the song!"
3,What the hell ?????,"I've always enjoy Gerard. But I've just finished watching this movie. Can someone please tell me what happened? I don't think Onoff actually killed anyone. There was no murder. There was no body. The sack that was been pulled from the van was full of Onoff's possessions. Also, I suspect that the police station is no police station at all. Can anyone help/confirm/clear-this-up for me ??Thanks very much. Peter"
1,Terribly boring,I do not see why anyone likes this movie. It is boring and meaningless. The actors and writers I like for their other works but the story line is just too blase and banal.
2,Not as novel a subject as it seems to be,"This film touches upon a topic that is better depicted in ""Lulu on the bridge"" with Mira Sorvino and Harvey Keitel. I say better because the anguish of the central character in that film is juxtoposed more effectively against the desire for life and love.In Pure Formality one cares very little about the main character's misery (unless you happen to be a frustrated writer by profession) and the absence of a main female character makes the film that much less interesting and captivating.However, both Depardieu and Polianski are superb in their performances."
3,I only found it average,"I saw this movie b/c I've been watching a few of Polanski's films and thought i'd see him act. The movie starts a bit slow, the dialogue is decent, but i found a lot of the quotes about his literature dull and vague (and the story about the genius vagrant quite over the top). Depardieu gives a good performance. Honestly, i didn't get the ending until readinga few reviews here, and although modestly clever (and it does tie in with what proceeded it in the story) I don't find it spectacularly interesting nor profound. I guess it's great that almost all reviewers here loved the movie, but I only found it average (and I do like foreign films)."
2,I'm at a loss to understand this film,"I thoroughly enjoy this film. Have watched it five or six times. Especially like it on a rainy night and if the house happens to be cold. But, what the heck, or where in the heck is the setting of this movie supposed to be? Purgatory? Insane asylum? Someone who thinks they know, please say. And don't tell me to just watch the ending again--I've done that, done that, done that, done that, done that, done that... I've done that. Thank you."
5,AN ABOSOLUTE MASTERPIECE OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT,"This movie is an astounding accomplishment. Although it is a thriller, the development of the characters is so magnificent I actually felt as if I were Depardieu's character at the end. I experienced his ""moment of realization"" as if it were my own. ""Pure Formality"" is one of the of the most well constructed and acted films I have ever seen. I currently own only three films (and I am an avid film buff- just very picky). It appears I will now own four..."
1,bah--humbug,Bought this item in May 2012. inserted batteries--tried it--good to go. Until August. Was going to use it for the first time AND--shuffler wouldn't work. Mechanism went backwards--would not shuffle. Am sure there must be a logical explanation and would love to speak to someone re this glitch.
1,E-Type,"This is great for anyone wanting to remake one of the greatest Jaguars ever made, but most people could care less. If you like this car, look out for the brand new concept F-Type."
2,E-Type,"Most people could care less about a spare parts guide for a car, but this is very useful for anyone wanting to build one of the best lines of jaguars ever made. If you like the E-Type, watch out for the new F-Type Jaguar is making."
5,wonderful mold,I bought this mold to make chocolate frenchies. The mold is very cute in person and works wonderfully. Also the plastic is great quality. I am very pleased with the product.
4,A Quick Read: Brings the Past and Present Together,"This book is short and that is the only problem, it has a great story line. Ms. Adams keeps the reader intrigued with the many quick twists and sharp turns. Lee is a strong character with unlimited potential. The reader is drawn to Dimetre, a strong shadow character. While reading this wonderful book I could not help but realize the problems of today are not much different from those of yesteryear. We want more!Recommendation: RECOMMENDEDLynn Young is the Managing Editor of The MWLA Review, a Reviewer and Editor."
2,I wish I wouldve saved my $60,I bought an XBOX360 just for this game and I must say I am disappointed...Nothing really that much more exciting than NCAA 2006 for XBOX....sure the graphics are nice but the dynasty mode is lacking...the create a player mode is lacking...and everytime I have gone to play it THE GAME FREEZES...none of my other games freeze...im not really understanding but I am frustrated...I think I am going to take the game back tomorrow
2,Worthless,"The game has absolutly no crowd graphics. The gameplay is again cut short of the ps2 and xbox like madden. Madden 06 had better grahics. The game has almost no new features except the momentum, which replaces the crowd noise. You totally feel like you're watching the game with no sound on TV, rather than being at the campus with screaming fans. Unless you love NCAA, don't buy this game."
2,Not worth it,"Honestly this is my first football game on the Xbox systems, I used to buy PC games, so I didn't really know what to expect. This game is not very good, and I really was looking forward to Madden 07, but now I will have to think about wether I should get it. I feel that EA sports, just threw it together and did not think about the players enjoyment. I was almost ready to take it back, the same day I got it, but I have stuck it out and will keep it. But it is not worth $60, if it was priced around $30 like the tennis game for Xbox 360, I probably wouldn't have written this review, since I would feel I was getting what I paid for. But for what I paid, this should be a much better game. Maybe they will come out with updates to download that will improve the player experience."
4,what a game.. what a game,"Alright first off i must say it doesnt have all the features that the old one had last year. Like create a school, the sports illustrated cover every week, and heisman race. But if your a true college football fan it has everything you need, Dynasty Mode and Online Play. What else is needed. The graphics are an upgrade and are only going to get better with time as they learn how to adapt. The gameplay is above average. It doesnt run as smooth as the xbox and ps2 did, but its not horrible just a small step down. I really would recomond buying the game if you love football. The dynasty mode is just plain and boring either. Its still got inseason recruiting and after. Its still got the heisman and all american canidates. Sooo go out and buy the game. Who cares if it doesnt have create a school or heisman race its got dynasty mode. Oh and not to forget the graphics are pretty nice."
2,DONT WASTE YOUR 60 BUCKS!!!!! BUYER BEWARE,"I was greatly disappointed when I bought NCAA 2007. I been waiting for months to buy this game, hoping it would be better than Maddden 2006 which was rushed out for 360 release so I gave EA benefit of the doubt. Ever year they make NCAA better and better but the 360 version is greatly lacking all the options that PS2 and the XBOX version have. Dynasty mode has no magazine covers none of the spring drills, just 3 repetitive mini-games. If they dont make a drastic improvement with Madden 2007, I'm trading in my 360 for a PS3 this fall."
1,TOO BUGGY. Gameplay if great when you are able to play.,"EA must have released this game w/o fully testing in various xbox 360s (meaning different Microsoft patched consoles). This review is only for the XBOX 360 version.90% of owners are finding it very difficult to either play a complete game or two games in a row. Why?There is software defect (bug) in the game. Without notice, the screen freezes and you'll see a ""dirty disc error (DDE). please clean the disc...blah, blah, blah"".If the defect/ bug is on w/in the game then it's an issue with the media that used.Regardless, no word from EA or Microsoft. Do a web search on this topic and you'll find countless forum posts.Regarding the game play and graphics, I like it better than Madden 07. When the game is playable, I give it 5 STARS."
3,Disappointed,"My son wanted to get this game after playing the XBOX (not 360) version that his cousin had. Unfortunately the 360 version did not have some of the cool features that the XBOX version had. He was very disappointed. Next time I'll be sure to check the product features and hopefully will catch any discrepancies. Of course this does not keep him from playing and enjoying the game but we didn't buy a 360 to get ""less"" features!"
2,Only a rent,"When I rented this game unfortunately I only knew number 10(Troy Smith). I thought because I hadn't kept up with my collage players it was hurting my game experiance, but I was wrong. There is absolutely nothing to do in this game. Even though I did not enjoy renting this game I still thought that the graphics were great and the players looked really life like."
2,Do not buy under any circumstances,"I have been a huge fan of the EA sports' NCAA football series for as long as they've been around. I have purchased ATLEAST 1 copy of every year's release since 2002, most of those were preorders so I could play the day it came out. I own this game for Playstation 2 and enjoy it as much as any of the other releases, the Xbox 360 version is another story. This game has so many glitches it is basically a game of luck instead of skill. For example: when on defense you can, at times, press the dive button and it will allow you to sack the quarterback even though he is five yards away. Your player and the quarterback's movements will look like a real tackle although it is obvious that they are nowhere near each other. Overall, nice (but far from great) graphics and HORRIBLE gameplay. I'll be sitting on the sidelines for 08 until I see if EA has managed to bring their NCAA franchise to the 360 the way it should be."
1,Worst NCAA game ever.....,"I always look forward to NCAA football being released every year but this is without a doubt the most disappointing version of this game I've ever played. Every year my brother and I play a dynasty with an option based team and take it to the top. I use the QB and he uses the RB's and it has always been a lot of fun. For some reason, this version decided to take away the feature of using 2 players on the same team!! Why would they take that away? Also, they took away all of the Division I-AA teams. If this system is supposed to be so great why are they taking features away from the game? In addition to these problems, the Heisman level seems easier to play than ever so it'll take no time for me to dominate the computer. For these reasons and many more I would suggest not purchasing NCAA2007 for any system and pick up a copy of NCAA2006."
2,I hope Madden is better,"This game is a huge disappointment, and for $60 that is just not acceptable. Game is too fast and the buttons are not laid out well at all. Sure you can change them around but why not fix them right in the first place. Graphics are good, but not great by any means. Save your money."
4,Not Bad,"The graphics are pretty good. The gameplay is awesome. I really don't like the fact that the other game modes (Race for the Heisman, Classic...etc) are taken out. If you want to strictly play college football this is the game for you."
2,waste of money,"i just played EA's NCAA 07 game and it was awful, they left out a whole bunch of features that they had in last years version like my favorite race for the heisman and the ones the did add were horrible like the momentum bar, the older and less expensive xbox 07 game is better the the new 360 version, also there used to be fans that would be going crazy holding up signs after big play and stuff but there arnt any that i saw and im just saying dont buy this game, BIG waste of money go play the old 06 game"
2,More for Less,"Short and Simple: You pay more, and get LESS with NCAA 07 on the 360. The college pageantry is absent, and half the stadiums aren't present.I can understand that EA has had to take a few steps back to replatform the game for the 360, but they had 12 months and appeared to have spent 2 months doing the work.How about less attention to the fancy glare on the windows of the press boxes at the Rose Bowl, and more attention to features and playability?!"
3,Make it like the one for the original Xbox,"I bought this game for the original Xbox, then decided to go out and buy a 360. I love this game so much that I bought the 360 version. The 360 version was nothing like the original Xbox version. The Xbox version had the Legend Mode where you could become a legend at your school. the 360 version does not have this mode. The menu options and controls on the 360 are nothing like the Xbox version. If they had made the 360 version like the Xbox version with the added graphics, this would be one of the greatest games of all time. The programmes had to go and mess with greatness. If you're going to buy this game, buy the Xbox or PS2 version and not the 360 version. You will be sorely disappointed."
3,I got ripped off!!,"Aight so i went to the midnight release of this Game and i was beyond hyped. I had seen all the new additions for it and i just couldnt wait to demolish the new campus legends mode. Heres the problem, I got it for Xbox 360, and for Xbox 360 there is no Campus Legends mode. All you can do is Dynasty. I have created my own Guy but its just not the same. The In-season recruiting is decent, becuz you get to invite your recruits to games and throw in things that would get there attention such as, Playing Time, Or Coach Prestige, and all that good stuff. My advice is go out and buy it for PS2 or Xbox(regular). I just hope madden 07 is a whole lot better. EA Sports has really gone down hill this year!"
4,Excellent detailed descriptions of dreadful feudal Poland,"Book club loved it. We laughed. We cried. So glad we didn't live in 18th century Poland as poor people. Clever and realist portrayal of an individual struggle with temptation. And critical description of man's inhumanity without sparing either side. Read also, ""A Day of Pleasure"" Singer's memoirs as a boy in Warsaw. Sheds some light."

1,Not 3 fl oz,"This product is only 1 fl oz. I'm going to have to figure out how to return it (or maybe just have them send me 2 more). I obviously haven't tried the product yet; if I do, I'll add to my review."
3,"3 1/2 stars--good album, a little too preachy, though","Sorry to angry De La fans, but how much ""anti-Versace"" raps can one stomach? I hated all that ""flossing""-rap that was commonplace in 1996 as much as they did, and I'm glad that artists like De La, Heltah Skeltah, and Jeru the Damaja help start the fight against that rap, but after a while listening to this album, it felt like De La was hitting me over the head with the ""I-hate-commercial-rap"" laments. But the album isn't without its highlights. Frankly, ""The Bizness"" featuring Common is reason alone to pick up this album. But remember, Prince Paul isn't on here.P.S. On ""Itsoweezee"", a line goes, ""Steadily crackin' jokes like Potsie/When's the last time you had happy days?"" Potsie didn't crack jokes; Ralph Malph did. Just a lil' something I noticed."
5,the soundtrack to summer,"De La Soul has always had their own laid-back sound in the hip-hop world. ""Stakes is High"" is the very essence of De La Soul, talking about what makes their lives good, what makes them bad, and everything in between. This is one of THE best albums I have ever heard, perfect for cruising with a 10"" subwhoofer in the back of the car or just chillin around the barbecue. To sum it up, this CD is f'in awesome. No question at all, if you like De La Soul, get this CD"
4,A great book about the spiritual experience called life,"This is a really moving book, a marvel at getting to the point of where spirit is to be found.It literally put me right back on the track of life, and made me wonder about the miracle of life, right here, right now."
1,MOVING MOUNTAINS,THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WORDS TO EXPRESS ABOUT MS DRAKE BOOK MOVINGMOUNTAINS ...IF YOU KNEW THE AUTHORS THE REST IS HISTORY.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SISTER DRAKE. YOUR SISTER IN CHRIST VICKIE I LOVE YOU BE BLESSED:)
4,A Shroomers Bible,"Contains lots of cosmopolitan species. So the book is great for European readers. The ONLY minus is a lack of color photos, but the B&W pictures are good. The book has lots of humour so its very entertaining. A must for your mushroom library."
4,Legendary Tome in Need of a New Edition,"David Arora's Mushrooms Demystified is the undisputed king of fungal field guides to western North America, and a landmark achievement. Since the second edition was published in 1986, no text has surpassed it in terms of scope or detail. However, 1986 was a long time ago. Taxonomy has changed quite a bit. New species have been discovered. Knowledge of medicinal properties of fungi has increased. I could go on, but I've made my point. This book is still great, but an update from the author would be fantastic."
3,Mushrooms demystified?,"If I were a beginner, I would have been totally confused by this book. The problem comes from the dichotomous keys. They can be confusing and lead you in the totally wrong direction. The author says up-front, that there are several reasons you can be lead astray by the keys, mainly user error. Well, the keys are only as good as they are written. After having said the keys are confusing, the rest of the information provided in the book is quite good and very detailed. I wish there were more color photos to go along with the descriptions. Yes, there are over 800 photos, but most of them are black and white. It is difficult to compare detail of an actual mushroom in the hand with a black and white photo. Overall, I would say this is a good book to have in your collection, but I would not depend on this book for identification."
4,Basic But Thoughtful,"This is a basic, but thoughtful handbook. The illustrations are excellent and the descriptions clear. While it's handy as a field guide for the novice, I wish it were available in paperback to make it more ""field-friendly"". Good value."
5,The Best,Ripped the pocket of my cargo pants trying to cram in this tome. I'll gladly carry a backpack on every excursion if it means I can haul this book along. Indispensable.
5,Great book!,Just got this in and so far I love it. I grew up hunting mushrooms but don't remember anything about them (except morels). Can't wait to start finding them again and with this book I will have greater confidence in what it is I find.
2,Outdated,"Simply put, this fungal guide is rather dated since so many mushrooms have been reclassified since it was written. For example the various chanterelles of California were not known at the time it was published. The section on Russulas is quite out of date as it seems at least a third to half the names are no longer valid. I should also mention that this book, in the best of times, is not easy to use without a microscope. The book is an interesting reference for the curious, but certainly not a current field guide. I like the humor in the book and the honesty on the part of the author that there is not enough space to be thorough on various groups."
3,amateur,"Definitely not for the amateur.He has good information but there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the arrangement,which makes it very difficult for a amateur."
5,A room with a view!,"I must say that a year ago I didnt give a hoot about shrooms! But now the ""friendly fungi"" adorn my house! I simply can't get enough of the ugly, rubbery little things.In the past several months, I have managed to make several handy items out of roomies including a hat and several very nice coat buttons. This Christmas, my wife and I plan to decorate our tree with mushrooms and another of our favorites, potatoes!"
2,Not a Good Move..,"I really liked the singers voice and the other guy they booted gave them a half decent sound . This is just insulting ...This is now a run of the mill rock band .... They should just change their name , in respect to the fans ."
2,ADEMA!!!!!!!!UNSTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PLANETS.........:(,"I was not mad like some people when this cd came out I was just extremly dissapointed. I was not aware that they had a new singer untill I bought the cd. I wish they would of changed the name to EDEMA of something so it wuldnt had fooled me into buying it. I really liked the Adema hits like Everyone, Giving In, Freaking Out, The way you like it, skin, Codependant, Unstable, Promises, Stand Up, So fortunate, and needles. but this new ""planets"" stuff is a discrace and many people didnt notice but not just chavez left also one of the guitarists left because now they only have 4 membors and only 1 was replaced. Any way Im not a kid im 16 i just dont have an acount peace out and Chavez keep rocking on without adema if u haf to........."
2,RENAME THE BAND!!!!,"the fact its still called adema is a insult. the new singer definatly doesnt go with this. Adema only has 3 cd's. Adema, Insomniacs dream ep, and unstable.. this is not 1 of them. FANS OF ADEMA BEWARE!! download and listen to sym tracks b4 u atempt to buy this. put a singer of a soft rock band into the instrumentals of adema and u get this $!^)"
2,Where the hell did Adema go?,"I heard that my brother had picked up their new cd and he said that they had a new lead signer so I checked out the samples on CDNOW and I wasn't at all impressed with the ""NEW"" Adema and their new lead singer. The music is not Adema nor is the new vocalist. I think they sound just like every other new rock band out there albeit not as good. Mind you I only heard the 30 second samples which can be misleading as to how the actual song is. Believe me I have previewed a few CD's on CDNOW that sounded like crap but were actually pretty good when I bought them. But I have no reason to believe that this CD will be any good. They should have at least changed their name, I mean if your going to sound like a completely different band you should. This is about as bad as when Sugar Ray changed from metal to pop. Hopefully they accumulate a good number of fans in the future and good luck ADEMA. But as for me I am done with the band."
2,Not the same Adema,Sorry this adema does not have the same singer and should not be called Adema !I liked the other 2 albums as they at least had a similar sound to Korn but atleast did a few things different and had a little uniqueness.....I agree they should have named this Band something else with a few of the other reviewers
2,*cry*,"well...its not adema anymore. if you are looking for adema, you will not find it here. with the replacement of the lead singer and i think i've heard a guitarist as well, its no where nar the same band. if you are gonna give this album a shot, treat it as an entirely new band that you've never heard of. now, the cd is...er..ok. its not bad. my ears didn't bleed or anything. however, the sound just feels dead and lifeless. everything is so lackluster, especially the vocals. not to bitch about the new guy (luke) but anyone who liked the original adema will likely be wishing they were listening to marky. so it gets two stars. not terrible, but not really worth it for an adema fan."
3,Ehhhh... Do I hear a name change???,"Yes, i kept an open mind, and I must say not only that this band is not Adema at all, but they have turned much more poppish. I am saddened to see this. I think the CD is still OK, i would give it a three and a half if I could. But what people are saying is true, although this singer may be better overall (depends on your opinion, close one) Marky Chavez was a much better fit with the band. But the guitar has matured so much it is incredible to me... There is a solo to almost every song. I dont know how to rate drums or bass though. And the singer is mediocre at best, but does not fit in with the band too well. I think that they should have at least changed their name. By the way, does anyone think that the last song, Estrella, sounds a lot like Metallica? (I think that is one of the best songs on the CD.)"
2,Not the same ADEMA,"The music is okay at best, but the main thing is that the singer has changed. Personally, I find his voice makes all the songs sound too similar. The overall sound of their music has changed drastically and maybe they should have changed their name and not tried to fool everyone into thinking this is the same awesome band as it was before.I would not recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed their previous work."
2,yeah it sucks but...,"You gotta hand it to them, it was a bold move to change the singer, sound, and leave the name as it is. Adema was a great band and well, they lost it. It wasn't for nothing they lost Chavez and Mike though. At the time Mike and Mark were having problems. They actually didn't speak to eachother for a whole year. Which was why their sophomore effort was titled ""Unstable"". So why be in a band with someone you don't like? Unfortuatly it was true. Mark and Mike departed the band with this new singer. He's good too and there are two outstanding songs in this album: Shoot the Arrows and Tornado. Those 2 songs is what gave this 2 stars and is the reason why I still have it. I have nothing against the new singer however. If Adema is loyal to their fons though I suggest a change of name since it is very wrong to MAKE the new singer like Mark."
2,Don't Expect Adema,"Bands in the past have done fine pulling off a change of singers...Adema is not one of them. I loved their first few releases, and this one is not half bad...it's just not Adema. If they announced a breakup and started a new band with this new singer I would probably really dig this album. However,I bought this album expecting Adema and got a completely different CD. This album has a cool and interesting sound...but it sounds nothing like Adema."
2,Not what I thought It would be.,"Well, the band was going downhill. But this release was just a big plunge. The new singer is not as talented as Chavez. This is nothing but a mediocre band trying to milk the Adema name."
2,Why?,"I still don't see why they kicked out Mike Ransom and Mark Chavez. For a nu-metal band they were pretty good. How dare they kick out the guitarist that made them sound heavy and the singer than made them sound angry? Marky's lyrics were sub par yes, but they way he integrated them into the songs was amazing. This CD deserves a 2 because if you never heard of Adema and this CD is the first you ever heard from them, then I guess it'd be ok. But in comparison with the original Adema CD's, it's a bag of crap."
2,Not good...,"I used to like adema, but since ive heard this cd, I really don't like it at all. It sounds bad. I mean, I give them props for trying, but the voice just doesnt flow with the music. They are all talented and should just go their seperate ways to find something better."
1,this is crap,i came into the idea of a new adema album without mark with a bad additude and left just plain pissed off.the instrumentals are blah the vocals suck. They should have changed the name now there just ruining the rep of a formerly great band and it makes me sick if your a true adema fan your gonna hate it if your not go ahead waste your money on it i don't care.
3,New Adema is pretty lame.,Was a big fan of Adema but i just cant get into this new cd. Different sound different vocals. Its just not the same.
3,Big Step Forward,"Not to tick off those of you who really enjoyed what Adema used to be, but I personally like the new sound that Adema has adopted with their new lead singer. They sound better, more well put together, than they used to. It is going to be up to personal preference, however, so I won't say that this CD blows away the first two. That being said, the first 7 or so songs on this album are great, but after that the sound sort of tapers out and the album gets rather boring. I like where Adema appears to be headed, but, as I said, it will be a matter of taste."
2,Too different to be the same,"It's true. Adema is dead. This album is completely different than either of the two preceeding CDs. There are no similarities and for that reason, I regret buying this CD. It's possible that if I had heard some of the songs off this album and thought they were a different band I might have enjoyed it. However, I expected Adema, and I was sorely disappointed. I suppose some of the tracks are ok, but unfortunately, none compare to any of the tracks by the real Adema."
5,"Not bad, not bad","Whoa...what a shocker. I don't like the band that much because that Marky guy ruined it for me. Definitly not like their other stuff. They did a good thing getting rid of that guy, he was bit of a whiner. Like the new one. Yeah. Going to buy the album now.I just realized they're on Earache, that's weird."
3,Umm..,"In my opinion it was a good idea to get rid of Marky Chavez, he was just a run of the mill vocalist with very sub par lyrics. The instrumentals were nothing too special either. This cd I actually enjoy only because Adema isnt trying to be the heaviest band, they are focusing on slower more rock / grunge oriented tunes. I think that direction fits Adema because the last thing we need is another crappy cookie cutter metal band.I think Adema will be finished after this album, but at least the band didnt die with chavez doing the singing."
3,"New lead singer, same instrumentals...","Some people just can't adapt to change. Even though Mark Chavez left the group and was replaced, I don't see a need to change their name. It's easy to recognize to that is indeed Adema on this album; other than the lead singer sounding a bit more like the lead singer of Trapt or an amateur Maynard James Keenan, the rest of the music is still the same. I think the new guy has great potential and his lyrics are a bit more mature than Mark's. I too was a fan of their first two albums and I'm glad I disregarded the negative reviews and bought this CD anyway. It is good, not great, but if you like Adema's past two offerings, and aren't afraid to hear them with a completely different sounding singer, then give Adema your $15."
2,What a let down!!,"I bought this album the week it came out because as everyone has stated it was supposed to be Adema, boy was I wrong! I have seen a few reviews compare the album to emo music, well that is exactly what it sounds like. Not even good emo! There are one or two peanuts lodged in the rest of the crap on the CD but I was expecting a lot more than what I got. Honestly, I can see some people liking this album, just not me or many other original Adema fans, as you can read. Bottom line is I agree with everyone else, change the name if you are going to change the sound of the music!! If your lead singer changes and the music stays the same then maybe I can understand trying to keep your old fans around but if you change the style of music you play, all you are going to do is piss your old fans off!! Business 101 damnit!!!!! I give it two stars for the one or two songs I do like."
4,"New voice, new sound","I saw Adema last night at a USO show in Mosul Iraq. I haven't actually heard the album yet, but the songs they performed off of it sounded a far cry from their older material, and much better. Luke, the new singer, can actually sing, and the chemistry they display gives hope that maybe this band is finally coming into its own. Definitely an album worth buying, whether you're already a fan, or you've never heard them, with tracks like Barricades In Time, Tornado, and Shoot The Arrow, this album showcases the broad spectrum of their talent, and will be a definitive one of their careers."
2,Slave to Love,"This is a dull, full-screen version of a 70s international thriller that might merit some attention if it looked better. It's pretty lame, but not really cheesy save for Ustinov's buffoonish clowning which belongs in a different picture. The great William Holden shows up for maybe a day's work -- he's supposed to be a cynical mercenary and crack helicopter pilot, but comes across more like a craggy old-timer going 40 in the fast lane oblivious to the fact that his turn signal's on. Much better is Rex Harrison turning in a tart cameo. He seems to have wondered in from a Graham Greene adaptation and he's welcome. Caine wears a Paddington Bear hat for the first third. You'll note his final confrontation with the villain of the piece is almost the same as in The Wilby Conspiracy."
2,Fine cast wasted on dreck.,"Working my way through the Michael Caine canon. This was just rubbish dressed up as social commentary. So many egregious plot holes I can't begin to list them. Omar Sharif should be ashamed of himself for playing a stereotyped lustful rich A-rab. And Michael Caine's eyes looked like no one was home, which isn't surprising after weeks of shooting in desert wasteland, directed by someone whose bad taste in music has to be heard to be believed. The camels were amusing, however."
5,Churches by Judith Dupre Fantastic,"This is the most beautiful book I have ever seen. Having traveled throughout much of the world, I have seen many of these Churches in person. She writes about them in such an informing and interesting way, that I find myself enjoying many of them even more in the book than I did in person because of the in- depth background included in the book. The photography is fabulous. Frequently, we were not allowed to take pictures in the churches, so now we can have a lasting memory of some of our most treasured experiences. I could not believe how reasonably priced the book on Churches was. That book is easily worth $150.00. I have frequently paid much more and gotten much less. I also have her book on Bridges and that too is most interesting. I look forward to acquiring all her books."
4,Good Book...Good Buy,"This is a very easy read and I was able to buy it for a low price, which is a good thing because I had to have it for a class this semester."
5,Best Tap Wrench I've Ever Used!,"This is by far the best tap wrench I've ever used. When you close the jaws on a tap, it holds tight and won't loosen up like EVERY OTHER tap wrench I've used. Not much more to say really, this thing just works well. Be careful though, after your co-workers use it they won't want to use any other!"
3,Great story but geographically incorrect!,"The story was excellent except that I do not believe Fern Michaels has ever been to Austin, Texas. It almost never (once in 10 to 15 years) snows there and absolutely never at Christmas or in blizzard conditions. It is not high plains, but rocky hill country. The area she was describing was more like the Amarillo, Texas area and even there, white Christmases are rare."
1,The never ending saga -- that should have.,"I read the first book, Texas Rich, a few years ago and found it all right -- typical soap opera saga in a book but decently written and very well researched. When I saw the second book, Texas Heat, about six or eight months after reading the first in a ""Free Books"" pile, I read that and found it to be much the same, except a bit more plodding and a lot wordier than it needed to be. By the time someone gave me the third, I was ready to die of boredom. The first book wasn't bad as far as romances go, but it should have ended there. I understand Fern Michaels mercifully cut us off at the fourth. I just wish she had the wisdom to cut us off at the first."
5,Great Story,This is a great story. It's been ages since I read it but could not resist getting it again. Someone stole my original.
5,fun fun fun,"it is indeed a wonderful record... and indicative of what a BUNCH of punk was back in the late 70s. not all shouting and growling... anyone who was outside the gary glitter dominated mainstream who called themselves punk was punk... lord love the xrayspex!btw, laura logic was the sax player, but she was gone by the time the album was made. oh bondage! was not on the original vinyl LP, either."
4,"A fun, amusing album, not the definitive punk masterpiece","Yes, this album is chock-a-block full of catchy, thrashy British Punk, circa 1977, but to me, it's faults underscore the very weakness of British Punk, circa 1977. It's the ""C'mon kids, be a punk-rocker! Everyone's doin' it!"" feel to the lyrics, the sense that punk was merely a fashion, and not a total disdain of fashion. ""It's 1977, and we're gonna show them all, apathy's a drag."" Gimme a break. And I'm not sure whether to be amused or annoyed by the ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" sax on most of the songs. Admittedly Poly-Styrene can sing like nobody's business (she sounds kind of like a tiny little female drill sergeant), and the songs are speedy little hook-laden anthems. I still enjoy listening to it, but unlike the Sex Pistols' ""Never Mind the Bollocks..."", the Clash's first, and the Buzzcocks ""Singles Going Steady"", ""Germ-Free Adolescents"" sounds dated and campy."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"This is one of the best punk albums ever! I actually don't own the CD but I have the old LP. The CD has some extra tracks that will make this album worth it. It's sad that they didn't get as popular as other punk bands like the Sex Pistols or The Clash. Anyways this is a MUST have album, almost everyone gave it 5 stars! So don't sit here at the computer, go out and buy this!..."
3,the river niger,bought this movie because i love cicley tyson. i watched this movie twice and i just didnt get it. the acting was okay maybe if i watch it a few more times i might understand what the whole movie was about.
3,POOR QUALITY,"I really enjoyed the acting and the plot of this film, especially the ending...Unfortunately the quality ofthis DVD was quite poor. The music was so tinny it was annoying. With all the top notch actors in this cast I reallywas disappointed in this production. I'm aware that the film was made decades ago but with all the modern technology available these days I expected a better product."
3,Not very good,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.This DVD gave me little educational insight into black life. Although it was an off Broadway play I didn't get much out of it. I give it 3 stars for the all star cast of James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson and Louis Goossett Jr."
2,Fair,"This movie had great actors, but very poor movie,It had a poor story to it, I didn't care for it at all."
2,"Good service, fair dvd quality","The dvd arrived on time and undamaged. Unlike the other half of this order, this dvd was fair."
3,Kind of disappointing,"I was excited to find this movie, but was disappointed with the movie after viewing it. The stars in it were wonderful; I suppose that the scripting could have been better...what a waste of wonderful talents."
1,It Bites,"The best part of the movie, was when it ended.....I've probably seen a more pitiful movie, but thank goodness, i can't remember"
5,Beautiful Engagement Ring!!!,It's a nice quality piece of jewel!!! Very well finish!!! Nice design! My wife just loved it!
4,"Simple, effective","Needed to prevent damage to a wooden floor, and settled on these as the best option.Drilled pilot and screwed these in to the end of hardwood chair legs, and they have been operating flawlessly since.Have to be slightly careful: do up the screw too hard, and it pulls through the material. Not hard enough, and the stop compresses just enough for the screw head to touch the floor!All told, very satisfied."
2,palm food,Again..This doesent work-I don't know how much fertilier is in each spike-I perfer the regular fertilizer to prevent waste and for measuring.
3,The fern died,"Well, the fern died and the palm is limping along. But these worked great on the bamboo.The fern was a Boston Fern and probably destined for extinction in my hot, dry house. I'm not so sure about the palm. I can't tell if it has too much or too little light.That said, the bamboo (the real stuff, not a dracaena) is responding very well, and so is the banana tree. All are indoor plants placed in a floor-to-ceiling window providing abundant, but indirect light. I've tried Boston Ferns before and failed every time."
1,World and Time Enough,"I thought the movie could have been just a little better than what it was. It was slow, long, and boring. The movie tired to present a nice theme of a one on one couple falling in love and staying faithfull to one another, but did a bad job of it. The movie, like almost other gay films, was centered around a HIV postive character. I am personally tired of gay movies with Hiv or AIDS sad being one of the main plot in films. There are more things in gay life other then HIV."
1,Not strong eneough,"Have not had a chance to return, can't use on wire shelving. Have to put solid board or pieces underneath. Still will not hold, hangs down from weight of anything."
3,A little wider than I expected but works well,I think the measurement under the descriptions was for the basket and it didn't consider the size of the handle so I had to make some adjustments in the cupboard which now doesn't lock very well. I definitely like the product as it arranges the cupboard so that the wasted space which was to the top I can now use.
2,There has to be better out there...,"My cabinet shelves are 1/2"" thick and this basket is too wobbly. It also hangs lower than I expected so I can't really put much underneath it. The prongs on top of the shelf are rounded too and not flat so you can't put things on top of them on the shelf above. Probably as the picture shows, this is better suited for a bathroom or laundry area rather than a kitchen."
2,May want to check out the HP7530,I bought this with an Olympus 3 mexapixel camera hoping to never have to wait to have film processed again. Using the printer was a snap. The controls are easy to figure out and it is very user friendly. The problem was the images. The color wasn't quite right and I kept getting small bands that looked like perforations when I viewed the picture at a certain angle. Customer support wasn't able to solve the problem so I returned the printer and ...got a HP7530 which I'm very happy with.
1,Easily the worst printer I've ever owned,"The print quality was poor for text and nominally acceptable for graphics. I have to ""clean the print heads"" before every print-out to prevent vertical line streaking."
1,A general Purpose Printer it is not!,This printer cannot print envelopes without jamming! Is there more to say?
2,Worst Printer I Ever Owned,"I've owned Digital, Canon, and Two HPs. Finally bought this to try an Epson. Picture prints are nice as described in earlier reviews, however the over quality and usability of this printer is horrible! Mine jammed almost immediately and when I went to unjam it, some parts came loose inside and I had to ship it back for a replacement (which they did at no charge). This printer is constantly jamming and requires very high quality paper (not general purpose like most HPs) or it will pull in 5-10 sheets at a time. The cartridges have a ""smart chip"" which means you have to by Epson factory cartridges which are VERY EXPENSIVE. The output tray is designed so that just brushing against the printer folds it up thereby causing the printer to jam. I DO NOT recommend this printer, particular for general purpose use."
2,High Maintenance,"I'd had old Stylus printer which I loved. So when I replaced it with this printer I hoped it would work in a same way. Well, it doesn't. 1.Paper jamms all the time.(waste of papers) 2. Image comes out too dark or too light.(waste of papers again) And all kinds of things keep happening and while trying to figure out the problem and solve the problem, there will be more waste of papers and time and cost. It's very high maintenance needed printer and I want to resell this and get better printer I hope."
1,Waste of money,"Dont waste your money or your time. It prints good when it works right(rarely). I didn't have this printer 2 months before I junked it. It was the noisiest and most unreliable printer that I have ever had. Top loading printers dont even compare to bottom loaders. I went out and bought an HP 1350v all in one printer for the same price and it is far superior to the Epson 825. My last HP, a HP-712C worked great until it wore out lots of heavy use."
1,Hated it...,"We were talked into this thing by an enthusiastic salesperson, and where stuck with it for two years. It cost easily 10X + it's sale price in wasted ink. Only about 10% of ALL attempts to print photos and documents actually have produced usable products!!! That's not an exaggeration 1 in 10 print attempts will be excellent, or something you would even consider to put in a frame or send to someone, the rest look like creatures from black lagoons to amateur screen printing mishaps.Then! You can not put more than one piece of ANY type of paper in the feed tray because the things sucks the whole stack half the time (even though the stack is not stuck together or carefully shuffled...)and either self jams or ruins the print job wasting MORE ink.Total piece of crap. I hate this thing."
2,Disappointment -,"I expected that Epson printer would be more economical than an HP (which I have owned 3 over the years). Everyone claims that the cartridges are far cheaper than HP. However, I have to change them 3 times more than when I had an HP! So, yes it is slightly cheaper, but not in the long run. And to make it worse, you have to always ""clean"" the heads everytime! This is ridiculous - and a waste of time that I do not have. HP - I'm coming back!"
3,Epson Stylus Photo 825 printer,"It prints beautifully BUT it really uses up the ink. I doubt that it will print 100 sheets of normal printing. It will not use up ALL the ink in the cartridges once it's censors decide you're low on ink. I went thru all of the ink cartridges in one roll of 4x6 pictures, approximately 60 4x6 pictures. Very expensive to operate but it works great and prints your worst pictures to make them look great."
3,review of Stylus photo 825,"First, I would like to say that this printer produces photos of tremendous quality! I was truly amazed at the clarity of the photos I printed. They were very close to laboratory quality. However on a downside, I only printed five 4x6 photos when the ink started going out. That is totally unacceptable to me. There is no way that I can afford to replace the ink cartridges after five pictures. It would be cheaper to go have the pictures developed in a lab. That is unfortunate, because I really liked it. I am definitely returning mine."
3,Reliable & Cheap Ink refills,"The Epson 825 Printer is a reliable Printer. However I would never give over $40.00 for one due to the fact that they are the older type printers. I have owned 5 of these printer and they are cheap on ink at [...] ; however, they constantly have issues with paper jams, and require the user to know the printers characteristics in the printing process. I wrote my 1st program in DOS in 1983, and I have extensive knowledge in all aspects of computers. I pay about $5.00/cartridge at the above referenced site; whether it is the Color cartridge or the Black cartridge. And when I purchased my first one of these printers I got it from Comp USA San Antonio, which is out of business. The printer was used for about 7-8 years before the printer head went out. I paid $129.00 for the new printer back then."
2,6 Months and toast,"Hello,I loved this printer when I got it...good price, excellent photo prints. But after 6 months, paper feeder no longer operates, twisting paper and casing jams and tears. Time to try something else."
1,beware,"We bought the epson 825 and it was the worst money we spent. It only worked for 7 mnths and the paper feeder broke. After we called they shipped us what we thought was a new one, that actually turned out to be refurbished. They don't stand behind their products. They don't even have an 800 number to call then on. How much money are they trying to milk you out of. Do not buy!!!"
1,Hate it also,This is my third Epson. The head on all of them started clogging within a year. I wasted lots of expensive ink trying to get this one unclogged. I'm done with the brand.
1,A boring read,"A misleading title. Most of the movies listed here are NOT ""apocalypse"" films. There is also very little analysis. A pretty book with little substance. Poor."
1,Poor Excuse for a pump,"First pump failed, of the same type, second came apart in the tank. plastic and o-ring fittings would come loose as you turned corners had to rebuild it with hose clamps, next time I'll buy the more expensive one."
3,"Action, adventure and just a little predicatble.","I enjoyed the book even though the plot was mixed up to trick the reader but without much success. The characters received more wounds than could be possible; nearly to the point of death only to heal almost instantly and be ready to take on a new battle. If they would have had magical healing powers it might have been more believable. In spite of a weak plot it was a decent read and I think the author has the potential for a really good book if he trusts his readers to be smarter than a 12 year old. I would like to see him write another, just to see if he does improve."
5,Get great energy,I love the energy I get from drinking this; I've trained myself to drink 7/8 oz every morning mixed with water. Takes a few days to get use to the taste but I perfer this than mixing it in my breakfast smoothie.
5,Super Sexy Collection,"Here's another winner from editor Alison Tyler! In this collection, she focuses on the sexy state of undress, or nearly undress. From the opening story by M. Christian ""Jess Undressed"" in which a man admires his stripped down girlfriend to Ms. Tyler's own piece ""Naked? Never"" in which a woman overcomes her fear of taking off everything during sex, the stories are varied and unusual. My favorites include ""Stroking"" by Cate Robertson, Savannah Stephens Smith's ""Naked Ambition,"" ""Radiance"" by Tulsa Brown, and ""Touch"" by Rachel Kramer Bussel. But really all the stories -- and there are 26 -- are excellent. The book has a nice heft to it, and the cover is gorgeous. It would make a really nice gift--which is what I thought at first--but then I kept my copy for myself. :)"
3,uses too much ink!!,"I have to agree w/ the other reviewer that said this printer is an ink eater. It's absolutely ridiculous how often I have to replace the ink cartridges. I rarely print in color & try to use the 'gray scale' option as much as possible, but it still doesn't help. Although the cartridges are cheaper (you can get all 4 for about $50) than most, they run out much faster so you end up spending just as much on them. The print quality is good & once the printer gets started it prints very fast, but having to go to the store & replace the cartridges all the time is a big hassle!"
3,Heavy Duty Printer,"Very good printer, great print and Hi-speed. But use's too much ink for small jobs because of programed head cleaning. Every time I open cover or print a page it goes thru a head cleaning routine. On one page print it will use more ink for cleaning then printing. It will use color ink for cleaning even when printing in greyscale only. It emptied my 3 color tanks in 3 wks while only printing 5 color pages. I may have to buy a cheap HP for small print jobs."
5,Excellent Value and superb printing capabilities,"I purchased this printer from J&R on a Sunday evening online and received it Tuesday...AMAZING...the setup was fast and easy, just make sure you purchase a USB cable because the one provided with the printer is quite short (2ft). The printer is wonderful, it prints text in the blink of an eye and photos nearlly as quick. Im astonished by the functionality of this printer. If your'e looking for a great printer at a great price look no further."
1,Worst movie in my life,The characters are so dull. The acting is mediocre and the theme is so predictable that I would prefer to watch HOmer Simpson.
1,worst movie I have ever seen!,I am not kidding. This matt kid spends the entire timesaying all the philosophy stuff that doesn't apply.the hot chick is actaully not as hot as the side kick.the jokes were lame and I thought they filmed it on the first shot everytime. it was very predictable and maybe worth watchingjust because it is terrible.
2,Couldn't get past the cheap shots,"I'm sure it was a funny movie. Luckily I didn't have to pay for it because I didn't even finish the movie. I'm thinking the screenwriter has some bone to pick with Buffalo, NY. That's the crux of the movie, the main character, in order to start paying off his student loans after college, has to take a menial job at his uncle's business in the northern most, snow filled city of America, Buffalo, NY. Nearly in Canada as the main character's ex girlfriend put it succintly. Meanwhile, it's December 30th, 2011, right now and we've barely gotten an inch of snow here. Which sucks because my nephews wanted to go sledding.Anyways, I didn't really appreciate the cheap shots at my city. It would have been funny one or two times."
3,Soundtrack is awesome,The movie was pretty good. However the soundtrack is awesome. I have been going to see Bottle of Justus play for the past 5 years. They are awesome guys with an awesome band. I am so happy to see how far they have come. I encourage everyone to go out and buy their CD's.
4,"A funny, warm, insightful drama","To be upfront, I know the filmmakers of ""Paradise Recovered"" ... I stand by my review, however and would not be writing this unless I firmly believed what I am about to write: ""Paradise"" is a beautifully done movie about a young woman's spiritual journey and maturation. If you are like me, that description initially might be squirm inducing. However, the movie is also a warm and tender romance and is often quite funny. This is not your typical indie drama. It is at times a surprising story about spirituality and grace, particularly given the hero of the movie is an atheist who comes to the aid of a Christian going through a crisis of faith. The acting by the two leads is splendid, they are a pleasure to watch, as are many of the supporting performances. The direction is sensitive and spot on. 'Paradise' is a lovely, entertaining movie with some complex ideas thoughtfully and honestly addressed. This is well worth your time."
5,My 10 year old LOVES This,"He has made so many cool things with this. He can build things alone, and sometimes it becomes a family project! Very cool gift for the kid that has it all and likes science. My husband says he wants one for himself!"
2,Don't get this CD!!,"I have nine solitude CDs, and this is a similar quality as Guardians of Atlantis. Don't buy this CD if you are expecting it to be a really peaceful songs as I thought when I read good reviews written below in Amazon. This CD is probably good for movie/documentary soundtrack but not for true relaxation. I recommend Solitude'sForest Piano (for sleeping)Piano Cascades (for sleeping)Songbirds Piano (for sleeping)Songbirds at sunrise (slightly more instrumental- perfect for morning)or Emerald Forest (slightly more instrumental)if you are looking for really peaceful CDs with few instruments and soothing nature sounds."
4,Great music-never forgot it,"I was sitting in a lunch resturant in Greenland in the year 1997. It was so beautiful to hear. I have looking for the CD since, and latest in Canada vere I was in 1999 jul/aug.But whit out result.I hope someone can help me to find this beautiful music and be helpful to mail the CD to my address in Denmark or here in Greenland. Thanking you in anticipation."
3,Quite and soothing mixture,"Technically, I miss the call of the common loon for most of the year. The CD brings back memories of living in northern canadian shield ecosystems."
5,(In)Security Guard --- and the human condition,"I've never had an emotional experience while viewing a film comprable to that which overwhelmed me while watching Signs an Wonders. Strangely enough I was most moved by the scene of Skasgard entering the embassy. This was a minor masterpiece of taut directing, cinematography, and acting--I was strangely touched by the actor playing the security guard, who with only the slightest of gestures somehow conveyed the essence of the human experience. A must see for all serious lovers of the cinema."
1,Signs & Yawns,"The worst movie I've ever seen. I was hoping that Stellan Skaarsgard would take off the yellow suit and burn it, but he didn't. He did however, finally take it off. I wish I never bought it."
2,Disappointing selection of women from the scriptures,"I love these board books, and have several of them. However, we won't be keeping Sacrament Time. With so few scriptural stories represented, I was disappointed that the two scripture stories of women selected for this book are women in trouble. There are so many strong and good women in the scriptures. And there are also men in need of help and repentance. The stories and images children are exposed to help form their ideas about their own roles and relationship with God and religion. Let's not forget that ""all are alike unto God"" including ""male and female."""
5,A Great Read,"Holmes delivers a gripping journey into 16th century Ireland and the history of the Connemara pony. One can almost smell seaweed, bracken, and the sweet breath of the beautiful Spanish horse washed up on the shore--soon to mingle his blood with that of the indomitable native mountain ponies. Cheers for the courage of common little crofter's daughter, Nora, in defying fear and Brittish tyranny in order to try to save the young Catholic nobleman, Jose, and the magnificent stallion, Lir; cheers as well for the message of letting go when we must. The reader is left hoping that Nora, Jose, Lir (and his offsping) might meet again!Susan Williams Beckhorn, author of Wind Rider, Harper Collins 2006"
1,Toxic ingredients defeat the purpose of trying to go natural,"The label on this says ""no alcohol, synthetic dyes, artificial flavors or preservatives."" Sounds good and natural, right? WRONG! Imagine my surprise when the ingredient list includes polysorbate 80, an emulsifier that has been shown to be hazardous on skin contact, inhalation and ingestion. Further, it's been shown to cause sterility in rats when injected. I was really excited about trying this product, but I cannot recommend it under these circumstances. I'd rather have a brand that you have to shake before using than something that uses chemicals to keep the solution uniform."
4,Great...if you like cloves,"I purchased this a few days ago after my herbalist told me it would help with my reoccurring gum infections. It cleared the current infection right up, so I'm definitely going to keep using it. My only complaint is the strong taste of cloves that lasts for hours. I hate cloves. Other than that, it's great. I found it a little strong (it made my eyes water. lol) so I water it down a little."
3,Very Strong,"Too much clove for me. Worked well after diluting by 60% with a minty mouthwash. Actually, I really like the mix."
3,Finding Moon,"I was disappointed in the novel, Finding Moon. Usually I become engrossed from the moment I start reading Tony Hillerman's novels, but this one didn't grab me. He had a good story line, but didn't flesh out his protagonist. I did finish it, but wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. Hillerman should stick with Chee and Longhorn."
2,No life,"Two stars for a very clever premise, but the writing is flat pedestrian, the people uni-dimensional, the pace plodding, no tension, no character development. It reads like a second draft that brings the plot together, and now is ready for color and life. But the color and life are never added, and despite the interesting basic idea the book never takes off. We learn nothing about any of the people that we didn't know at first meeting them, Moon gains nothing of value to his character, and it's just a very sadly dull book that should and could have been a good one."
3,Finding Moom,"Not my favorite from this author, I much prefer reading about officers Chee and company. However, a nice quick read"
4,A Nice Change of Pace for a Talented Author,"I knew immediately from the paperback blurb that this would not be a typical Chee/Leaphorn novel and was prepared to see what Hillerman would do with a new setting and a new group of characters. I found Moon very entertaining, a busy man who is very reluctantly drawn into locating the child of his deceased brother. The news headline chapter headings drew me back to the chaotic days at the end of the US involvement in Vietnam and the psychological changes in Moon's perspective as he is drawn deeper and deeper into his search were very believable. Of course, some of the action-sequences are pretty hard to believe, but don't we all enjoy Indiana Jones?? It's a pretty fast read, well-written, and I think you'll enjoy the change in pace from Hillerman's usual ouevre."
5,One of TH's Best,"All you need to know is that it is an adventure, not a mystery. The rest is Hillerman's typical brilliant story telling. In fact in this novel Hillerman goes beyond the usual because he weaves in historic events that are usually forgotten about in today's media (ie the real ending of the Vietnam War)."
3,Good book for a Tony Hillerman fan,"I enjoyed this book on cassettes, but thought the ending was a bit abrupt. Anyway, I'm glad I listened to it and enjoy anything by this great author."
4,a surprisingly effective change of pace,I forced myself to read this book after I had exhausted the supply of Hillerman's Navajo mysteries. I was completely caught up in Moon Matthias' search for his niece and for himself. Mr. Hillerman subtly blended suspense with his usual attention to characters' integrity and his obvious respect for varied religious traditions. I was very satisfied with this story.
2,Interesting Change in Venue,"I just started reading Tony Hillerman and was really enjoying his Indian characters. When I saw a different venue it was exciting, and I couldn't wait to read it.Well, it was interesting but not up to what I was used to from this author. The Story was good but not deep enough, you are always waitng for something to happen. No excitment. Moon was a boring character and could have been written with a little more depth.Please stick with the characters you work with best."
2,This is Hillerman?,"I guess I was expecting the same kind of quality I've discovered in the Chee/Leephorn books. First off, this was NO mystery and as even a mainstream novel it didn't work very well. Where are Hillerman's famous strong settings and ability to emerse you in his fictional world? Sadly, they are not here. No fresh new slant on old material, no insights into the human condition. This one wasn't as good as ""Fly on the Wall"" which wasn't very good at all"
5,Finding Moon,"This is Hillerman at his best, not that I have ever read anything that wasn't 'best'. He's just a great story teller in any environment, so to speak."
5,Great book.,I was really pleasantly surprised by this Hillerman departure. It took me off into that land where I'd hope the book wouldn't end.
3,"Jungle, not desert","If you've read Hillerman, you probably think of his US desert Southwest mysteries. This one's set in SEAsia at the end of the Viet Nam war, and is more militarily-oriented. Less appealing to me than his usual style/genre, but still a good (and very quick) read."
1,Finding a prune,"I have been looking at reviews of different books to find if other readers are in synch with my views. This is definitely where I differ.It has been probably a year since I read this book,and I don't remember all the specifics, but I can tell you the thing that I do remember is that it stunk.Hillerman is one of my favorite authors and I have either really liked or liked his other books, but I found this one nearly unbearable. It has nothing to do with the fact that Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee were not in the book at all. I can appreciate plenty of authors who don't constantly use the same characters.My opinion is if you really love the Chee & Leaphorn mysteries stay far away."
2,Absolutely boring,"This book is about the clash between modernism as reflected in early 20th century American culture, and traditional religious thought. The author,"
1,Dejavu,"I'm the lead developer for a software development and training firm. My boss had me buy this book, for an upcoming SQL Server data warehousing project. One problem though. This book doesn't tell you anything about how to build a data warehouse, it tells you why you would want one, but not what to do after you know you want it. Further more, it is the exact same book, word for word, with a few exceptions, as the Oracle 8 Data warehousing book, also written by Corey, Abbey, Abramson, and Taub. All they did differently, was they wrote about 10 pages on SQL Server, pulled out all of the information on UNIX, and did a find an replace for ORACLE and OEM. Other than that it's exactly the same book, they even left the chapter titles in the same order. I'm sorry, but letting the guy that made microsoft bob write two chapters doesn't make it a SQL Server book."
2,Basics of Data Warehousing using SQL Server 7,The book carries very important informations for the beginners in data warehousing. These informations include basic concepts of data warehousing and tips for using SQL Server 7. Experient Data Warehouse developers will find this book useless since it brings little technical data.
2,Not enought info on on how to build warehouse-applications,"If you are looking for how to build warehouse-applications with SQLServer as database then this book is not the right one for you. This is a ""what is a datawarehouse"" and how has SQLServer deployed this way of thinking"
3,Simple & Easy For The Beginner,There are 10 books in the Basix series (Two on guitar method). New players should find them helpful.
3,Nothing Exclusive Here...So Only 3 Stars...,"Being a huge fan of the much underrated Aimee Mann, I must say that the four songs presented here are simply wonderful through and through. The first track, ""Red Vines"" is taken from her latest release, ""Bachelor No. 2"", and the remaining three tracks are all taken from the soundtrack to the film ""Magnolia."" If you already own these two albums, then you don't need to buy this release of previously available recordings. Being a die hard collector, I purchased it to round out my collection, however, I must say that I am disappointed that exclusive tracks, even live recordings perhaps, weren't included on this release, which is the only reason why I gave this five-star recording only three stars. Give us some new or live material Aimee...we're dying for it!"
2,Not as cool as it looks,"The chair is designed for extremely short people. The cushion has the wrong ""folds"" to fit the chair. And the manual has some amusing, but not very helpful phrases like: ""For avoid the noise, please make sore which the Tie-Down Straps secure cushion to chair tightest."" That's pure Engrish..."
4,An advancement for ALL the english speaking world,An alphabetical listing of admirable traits and how to implement them. Interestingly it does contain the title pages of the original from 1824 et al. If I was to offer some criticism it would be that it is incomplete and lacks the dual language to help those less versed in the original Hebrew.
2,Not quite what I hoped,"This edition has some great photos, but as I look at the closeups I feel that the artist overuses his gold-ink pen as well as his white-ink pen. The result is a less-than professional appearance of many items. He doesn't mention copyright restrictions, either, and if you wish to sell your decoupaged products, you could be sued by artists who've copyrighted their photos or paintings, etc. This was not an expensive book, so I will not return it. But I will look for other books that give more detail as well as instruction in how to glue in papers without getting wrinkles at the corners, for example. In other words, I hope to find decoupage books that teach us to produce items that are more professional in appearance."
3,Fun and Lighthearted,"This was an entertaining book and I enjoyed it. I don't agree with theinstructions in all cases, (rather ""hobbyist"" instead of ""professional"")but very fun to read, and some of the photos are astounding. The ""old"" decoupage is not that difficult and so I would not recommend this as the ONLY book to buy on the subject, but am happy I didn't miss the playful and energetic output of this writer. Fun projects~~!"
5,"Style, Daring and a Touch of Humour","Durwin Rice is that very rare bird - an artist with a sense of humour. In his book,""New Decoupage"" Rice inspires both enthusiasts and newcomers to the art to throw off conventional thinking and make for themselves a future antique. He avoids anything twee and brings a fresh eye to his passionate love affair with paper and scissors. Through his very user-friendly web site Rice gives personal guidance to anyone needing advice. Many of the glass plates used in the book can be bought by mail from this excellent support site. I found this book refreshing, funny, inspiring and a great bedtime read."
4,A great book but ...,"I ordered 3 books on decoupage, but none could compare with New Decoupage. The book is well written with a sense of humour, beautiful photographs, and well-explained examples. The only drawback, I feel, is the area of sources of images. Since the writer is in the business of selling his decoupaged objects, I question his use of xeroxing images from books and other sources. I wonder if this is abuse of copyright laws. He does not address the copyright issue at all in the book and that concerns me, being a writer myself. Otherwise, the book is excellent, but I could only give it 4 points based on the copyright issue."
5,A Fascinating Look at the Soul of Nuclear Weapons Lab,"I have been working across the street from Lawrence Livermore National Labs (LLNL) as an intern at Sandia National Labs, and picked this book up in Sandia's library to get a better sense for the community around me.The culture in a nuclear weapons lab is utterly unique. Coming from a background where most of my friends are against nuclear weapons, it is interesting to work among people who believe with their heart that what they're doing is good for society.Hugh Gusterson does a great job at documenting the culture of the LLNL and how it fits in with the culture of Livermore, CA, and how it clashes with the culture of anti-nuclear weapons activists. Gusterson's objectivity is refreshing, and the material is fascinating.If you've worked at a national lab, want to get into the minds of a nuclear weapons scientist, or just want to learn a bit about one of the US's biggest national laboratories, I highly recommend this book."
2,Armchair Anthropology at its worst,"Background Info: I majored in Anthropology at college.This book has 2 main problems. 1) It is horribly boring. Yes, there are some interesting field works here. But too often the narrative is bogged down with explanations of anthropological or postmdern or Focaultian theories, which add absolutely nothing to it. I wanted an ethnography, not a text book.2) The author did not one observe employees at work. Although this is understandable, it makes it hard to write a believeably ethnography. Obseving the employees at work is fundamental to research. Without that, this is just psychology, and not really true anthropology."
4,Will probably outlast all my other appliances,Arrived with minor chips on the enamel which fellow Staub users described as normal in the manufacturing process ... So far I've used it for stews and roasts and had no issues.
3,music content,I was dissapointed in the music content. I was hopiing for early recordings of Luiz Gonzaga. The music on this cd seems to be later stuff. I grew up listening to Luis Gonzaga and didn't recognize any of the songs. It was good Forro music but not quite what I was looking for.The disc and cover was in good shape.
3,The Janus Battery,"Versatile product. Be forewarned that this listing is not for two CR1220 3V lithium batteries, one face up, the other face down, as the photo implies. If it were, the face down battery might be jostled into the face up position during the shipping process, and vice-versa, the face up battery might be jostled into the face down position. Hijinks then ensue. Seller alleviates this potential hiccup by photographing two batteries on opposite sides within one frame, thereby inadvertently intimating something about the duality of man.These batteries may also be used for games of tiddly winks when charge has been depleted. Keep in mind that you will, however, need to purchase more than one battery for an effective game of tiddly winks."
5,It's Not Easy Being a Single Mom,"Diane Keaton and Liam Neeson are fine in this powerful, but disturbing tale of a single mom who has to fight to keep her child. I believe it is based on the novel."
4,Value for the price,"The cashmere crewneck sweater is fine but not great. Compared with other cashmere sweaters in his closet, my husband states that this one is not as warm as others he has. It was made in China and although it says it is 100% cashmere it is not pure mongolian cashmere so not as warm.The fit is exactly as expected and the color is beautiful so the price was exactly on the mark. We are very pleased with the purchase."
1,Not as described,"The description of these sheets is not accurate. They are listed as 5.4 oz flannel and when I received them, the package stated 4.4 oz. They felt thin and lightweight and I returned them as I was looking for heavier weight flannel sheets."
5,"SO SOFT, GREAT FIT AND PRICE","I am so happy with the wonderful softness of these sheets! The bottom actually fits my mattress without having to stretch it on and plenty of top sheet, too! I also noticed that the stitching was very good (nicely finished off & not likely to unravel) when compared to other flannel sheets I have. At this great price I was afraid of just the opposite of what I received. THIS IS A GREAT PRICE AND GREAT VALUE!!"
3,"GREAT PRICE, OK product...","You DO get what you pay for. The price for this set (and it's matching duvet cover) is a bargain but if I had seen and felt it in the store before purchasing it, I would have passed on it and held out for a better product. I was hoping for the nice, thick, soft flannel but instead got cheap, thin flannel bedding. You can actually see little TEENY spaces in between the threading in the fabric so YES, it is thin! Luckily, mine has damage to it (I'm sure just a fluke) so I get to return mine! :-)"
4,A great product for this price,"I bought this to go with a Wamsutta duvet cover in Lotus to match. Sure the sheets are a little thin, but with a blanket on top, who notices? For under $10, I don't know what everyone's complaining about. It's very soft and cozy, and exactly what I was expecting. Great product!"
2,I got the wrong size top sheet!,"I ordered these sheets based on their price. When I went to put them on the bed (after washing them) I found that the bottom sheet fit my king-size mattress well, but the top sheet only covered the top of the mattress. There was absolutely no fabric left to hang down over the sides as one would expect to have. The sheets have tags in them, but no size indicated, so I can't tell what the top sheet is supposed to fit. I just know it doesn't fit my bed. I'm disappointed, but not with the quality of the fabric--it seems fine for the price."
5,Luxury Flannel Sheets,"I have used flannel sheets for over 30 years and these are some of the nicest ever. The price was outstanding--we were able to purchase two sets for the price of one at our local discounters.The sheets are heavy and the fitted sheet is very deep to accommodate deeper mattresses or mattresses with pads, etc., on top. We love 'em! We saw one review complaining the sheets were not the weight quoted, but our very accurate kitchen scale showed the set to be over the 4.5 lbs. quoted."
5,flannel sheet set,"durable, warm, good price, easily ordered/delivered to 3rd party, a little thinner than some of the higher priced bedding"
4,very satisfied,"I bought these for a vacation home and I have no complaints. The sheets were of very decent quality as far as I could tell. They held up fine in the wash. I don't know how they'll do over repeated washings, but at this price, who cares? Indeed, they are not a very thick flannel as others have mentioned, but they were just fine for the Northern California winter climate."
3,Good but doesn't fit the tempurpedic bed system,It says that this will fit a mattress pretty thick but it keeps coming off of my cal king tempurpedic mattress. Lousy for it but it would be nice for other thinner mattresses.
1,American author comes to England,"I bought this book in a used book shop, read it and disposed of it straight away. The plot is loose and pushy in an 'american in england' kind of way. The author shows very little knowledge of the Vietnam War. Don't waste you money."
1,"Racist Soft-Porn Trash, Poorly Written and Boring","With its racist caricatures and cliche situations (e.g. A man gets murdered while copulating and it takes his bimbo partner a while to realize what happened), this book would've been laughble were it not so poorly written. It's good to see that this book got what it deserves - getting out of print. BTW, this book has NO relation to the movie."
5,Absorbing and compelling account of the Soham tragedy,"This book is extremely well written. It tackles a difficult subject tastefully and factually. The level of detail is impressive - the author was obviously very close to the whole sequence of events, as well as carrying out in-depth research.Particularly compelling is the account of the interview Yates conducted with Maxine Carr in the very house in which the girls were murdered. Only days after the interview the truth came out; it is easy to sense Yates's shock at seeing the story unfold right in front of him, as one of the main reporters on the scene.Yates delves into Huntley's past, trying to discover how someone could grow from being a child himself to becoming a child-killer. We are left with the sense that there is no easy answer, that his life story doesn't really explain it all, that maybe some people are just born that way. A chilling thought."
1,French for McMansions....,"A very disappointing look at how to add tacky ""french""(?) touches to your home. It is perfect for McMansion styling and Nouveau Riche interiors and those who love them...."
3,"France, American Style","Beautiful photos and interesting commentary on French social customs. However, the featured residences are not French, but American homes decorated ""in the French style,"" which is somewhat disappointing."
5,"Brilliant, Great Sense of Design, a Visual Delight","Not unlike all of Phillips' books, this book is a masterpiece of European syle and design. No detail is left unnoticed. The furniture, fabrics, antiques, architecture, artwork, and carved stone are each carefully considered and beautifully photographed. Every page is a visual delight. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"
3,Cult classic,"Having lived and traveled in the Comores Islands, I found this film charming and alarming. It's charm was in its overabundance of trite lines, overacting, stereotypical antics and Nick Nolte's absolute innocuous, stilted bad, bad, bad acting. It was like a ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in the midst of the Indian Ocean. What was alarming was its total defamation of the Comorien culture. There were actors speaking Swahili (not the local language of the Comores) and...well, just imagine: US, white South African, French-Reunionais and others of European descent making a ""movie"" in an African country...and voila! little or no mention of the Comorien culture and no justice done to it. Other than those disservices, the film was pure cheesey. Great for showing and reshowing and learning the cheesey lines to recite along with the the ""actors."""
4,Sypnosis,"This book addresses the importance of focusing an organization around systems or processes, and how such a change can affect how health care managers deal with ever-present financial pressures. It also contains a step-by-step method to be used by managers to start developing a core business system structure for their organization. In order to achieve a core business system organization structure, the authors believe that health care managers need to refrain from making changes based solely upon bottom line or end results. Discussed are reasons why it is dangerous to apply quick fixes to the problems involved in reducing costs, as well as the importance of making changes based on a thorough understanding of the system."
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Manual is VERY poor for trouble shooting. Has a phone number, but at customers expense. Online help is NO help. Don't walk from this company, RUN...as fast as you can !!!"
1,very poor customer service,"The paperort software has errors. The tech support does not seem to know how to fix. They gave me steps to do assuring me this will correct. After several hours on the long distance call and following their steps it still has the same error message""cannot creaete link beacause link already used"". I was promised a call from a higher lever tech-A week after the promise date and time I get an email. I did call on the date to see what was going on. This tech gave me the same steps as the first agent did. I have not received a reply to that email yet-3 days."
4,"Helpful, fun book","I found this book in a DC bookstore while shopping for books to read on my trip to London. What a gem! it's fun, simple, and amazingly accurate! I used it with a native Londoner to see the city form a different viewpoint and we both had a blast and learned a great deal! I hope these ladies do more books like this one - maybe something on Oxford??"
5,The Amateur Historian's Guide to Medieval &Tudor London,"For anybody who wants to know more about the history of places they want to see in England, this is the guide book for them. I learned alot of interesting things and had alot of fun reading this book. I like the authors' style very much. They make the history easy to read and understand."
2,A few tips that are ok but overall worse 3d book i've read,"This is probably the worse 3d book i've ever read. It tries to meld in traditional 2d animation and 3d together but it's attempt fails. The author admits to not really relating figure drawing to his line of work while all the interviews with the animators swear by it. Gesture drawing the figure is the primary fundamentals of animation according to the best animation schools, best 3d studios, and best animators in the industry. I do however respect the artist for being a stop motion animator. Also the tutorials are too concise. If you're not too familiar with the Maya interface and langauge then you'll be very frustrated. The interviews are so lame where the author leads into Q&A and answering his own questions and fulfilling his own answers.I'm glad i checked mine out at the library. Save your money and look for a Maya book with better reviews."
1,lame,this book is overrated. just read the manual that comes with your software. it does not share anything new even though the writers are 'in the industry!!!'.
2,Long Term Loser,"While the size, shape, and function of this remote is nice I have to say that it is best to stay away from it. HK has horrible support and has taken the programming software off their website and now charges for it ($10). Seeing how Logitech makes frequent and free updates to their software, I feel this is outrageous and warrants a poor rating. Long term you do not get the same programming and software updates as do the Harmonies. You are always behind in firmware and software and now you have to pay to upgrade. Customer Service at HK is a nightmare I had to redial a long distance number (no 800#) for 30 minutes to get past constant busy signals. Once there I had to wait 40 minutes to talk to someone that just passed me to a different dept. which then passed me right back and so on and so forth until a bad transfer disconnected me. Do yourself a favor, get a different remote because if you ever have a problem HK does not stand behind their products without a fight and a charge."
3,"Pretty good, but buttons small","The programmability is pretty easy, but the volume and channel buttons (the ones most people use the most) are small, and I think they should be much bigger and protrude more from the remote. The top menu buttons are a bit small as well."
5,Great Remote!!!,"This thing is amazing. Handles every peice of equipment I have, has the ability to customize buttons, and is VERY easy to set up. I was initially concerned about the issue with the sticker leaving glue on the display....but a little rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and it comes right off.So easy to use...my wife finally feels comfortable using my system."
5,EASY & WORKS GREAT!,"I purchased this product after reviewing many, many remotes. I was not too thrilled to pay much more for others brands that basically did the same thing! This remote works exactly like it says, is in color, and setup is extremely easy! No longer am I searching around for the DVD remote, basic tv remote, and DirecTv remote.The only cons for this product are that I had a problem with the start up process on my first computer, the included TC software could not locate my internet. Once I switched to other computer, no one problem there. May have been my computer..The buttons are not soft buttons, they make a click when using the buttons, still no biggy. It takes a few seconds for the remote to turn on the tv and directv receiver, but hey..I don't need to look for two remotes.Buy this remote, you will LOVE it!"
5,Wonderful sound and easy to connect,"I have always had Panasonic stereo equipment and when I decided to get a new receiver looked at this model. The sound is amazing I am using it with a 100 W surround system. Works great for TV, DVD and even with my iTunes wireless set-up. The sound is so much better than the older system and there is an almost endless number of adjustments you can make to get the sound just right. With my music classical, pop or vocals all sound great! Recommended highly"
1,read the fine print -- they jack you hard!,You have 3 months to use your card or they eat whatever balance you have left. They go out of their way not to draw your attention to this little detail.
3,STI worked out okay for me.,"It's true that STI unilaterally added a three dollar a month fee to their prepaid phones. They deduct the fee automatically from your airtime balance.I got my phone for free in a package with an air time purchase. The network is Sprint PCS, so you should first check whether Sprint will work well in your area.There are deals out there for the phone and for the recharge cards, and you might want to compare other prepaid phone deals with what you can get for STI. Deals come and go, so if you don't need a phone immediately, keep watching and you probably can find a phone for free with $.10 a minute calls. Don't go for any deal until you find out whether the phone will work where you want to use it."
4,The Blood Doctor--Intriguing,"I was really pleased with the Blood Doctor for two main reasons. First, the novel is a great exploration/discovery of the ambition of one man and the pain this ambition brings him in the end. Second, Ruth Rendell's last novel, Adam and Eve and Pinch me, disappointed me with an overly multi-layered plot and characters. It was a pleasant surprise that she went back to a story that is less dimensional, without being simple.The novel is engaging. It tells the story of a man who is trying to write his great-grandfather Henry's biography and is researching his past to uncover facts. Henry, a prominent hemophilia specialist in the 19 century turns out to be a person obsessed with his career and areas of study to the extent that he commits the cruelest act.My only negative comment about the book is that unlike other reviewers I found the House of Lords subplot/descriptions tedious and not really contributing to the theme of the story."
2,I felt cheated,"Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell has written several very good books. That is why I thought this one would be like that as well. The Blood Doctor is very well written, not complicated at all although it deals with genealogical charts. But since the beginning of the novel you'd think the great secret of the Doctor is that he was Jack the Ripper or something along those lines, and when you get to the denoument you end up thinking ""and this is the horrible secret??"" I mean, this would have been a great short story or novella, but not a novel of almost 400 pages.I am going to continue reading Barbara Vine's books (although Grasshopper was awful!) because I know there is going to be another one that will leave me completely surprised and excited like The Chimney Sweeper's boy or No night is too Long."
2,"""Themes of obsession and murder""","Well, there is an obsession, and there's a death that can be considered as bad as murder.I agree that at 370 pages, the book is too long, but other reviewers have not noted these two additional facts: it takes forever to get the unveiling of the mystery started, and when it does start, I guessed what the secret was long, long before our hapless narrator does. Both these facts made me restive.I suppose the themes of the House of Lords, and of Martin and Jude's problem, are brought in to weave additional symbolism about ""blood"" and inheritance; but both become wearisome.And no one, even the ever-reflective Martin Nanther, notes that the creation of ""designer babies"" poses in its way another question of killing."
3,A bit bloodless...,"In ""Blood Doctor,"" the reader spends a lot more time in the head of fatuous, middle-aged member of Parliament Martin Nanther than in any state of suspense. That comes as a bit of a letdown considering the book's title and salacious jacket copy. But Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell is hardly your typical hack-n-slash mystery writer, and for long stretches, it's worth sticking around for the ride. Several hundred pages in, however, the fact that both main characters are basically unsympathetic starts to erode what pleasure there is in Vine's writing and powers of observation. And this American reader is hardly fascinated with the intricacies of the House of Lords and the petty snobberies of Britian's class-obsessed multitudes. The mystery at the center also comes out as unsavory rather than horrifying. But I'll certainly pick up another Vine/Rendell book, just to get a glimpse of the author's idiosyncratic and skillfully rendered obsessions."
2,A reader's labor with no writer's pay-off,"Only the die-hard Vine fans will want to attempt this long, redundant concoction of biography and murder mystery. No plot device, interior monologue or character analysis is not repeated as many as three, four or more times. And still the Russian-novel-like list of generations of characters in one family remains confusing and vague. I slogged on and on because I detected some major shocker of an ending, a twist to make it all worthwhile; unfortunately that is never delivered. Vine has written some choice novels, but this is not one of them. Not even close."
4,"Very Complicated, Dark and Creepy","Barbara Vine (Ruth Rendall) is an author that is worth reading. She writes intelligent and complex books that make the reader really think. They are also addictive. This book is even more complex than most. It's an historical mystery written in the light of the present day and she weaves back and forth from the past to the present almost effortlessly in the book. This is a very original way to approach solving an ancient mystery or secret. We have a modern-day biographer that delves back into his own family history and finds some dark and ominous secrets, and as this modern-day author discovers more and more information about his forbears, the more appalled he becomes. We also have parallel story lines with family lives and births and deaths mirrored from the past into the present day into this author's own personal life. A very complex tale that is well worth the effort."
1,Not what I expect from Barbara Vine/Ruth Rendell,"I am sorry to say that I did not like this book. I eagerly look forward to all Ruth Rendell's new works, except the Wexford series, not being a detective fan.I was quite disappointed with The Blood Doctor. I was soooo bored and felt no connection to the characters. I got so tired of Jude's whining that I just wanted Henry to find another wife! I am sure people who are interested in the workings of English Parliament found the book enjoyable.Ruth Rendell still remains my favorite author, and I happily await her next book."
2,"Tedious, Boring and Dry","I thought this was supposed to be a mystery. However, it was more like watching someone else's vacation photos or reading in depth another person's family tree. Completely mind numbingly boring. The cover and back page reviews state it ""builds in tension"". HA!It takes almost until the last two pages to solve what we as the reader saw coming miles away, and is so bland in it's actual revealment that who cares????? After all of that talk of Mrs so-and-so married Mr so-and so over and over and over, you just dont care anymore. Dont waste your time. This is not suspense, it's tedium."
2,Whisltes too low,If you turn the volume way up on Feathered Phonics Volume 2 to hear the whistles and the songs and rhymes are too loud. This edition suffers from volume problems.
1,dissapointed,"It wasn't what I exspected. I have a cockitiel, that is not going to do nursery rymes, that a regular child would lern. I was hoping that that would have been much easier things for my bird to learn. He does. things like Good Bird, love you, Bye Bye, and pretty bird. I was hoping for him to have more simple things like that to learn more of. And I had hoped for DVDs. I have niether, and my bird pays no attention to the ones I bought. Thankyou, Char Russell"
3,Cockateil companion,"This cd was ok but skipped a lot at first so ordered a 2nd one but before the 2nd one came the first all of a sudden stopped skipping so returned it without opening it. (this was the reason for the return, so i wouldnt be charged twice.)"
2,Bird Phonics,"Would not buy another unless I a able to hear what is on the CD. I don't like the format of the video. Too many items for the bird to learn unless you play one at a time. I need soething for her when I am not with her,"
1,THE WORLD OF LI'L ABNER,"THE WORLD OF LI'L ABNER IT JUST FELL APART. I ENJOYED IT, BUT THERE WAS NO BINDING TO THE PAPERBCK"
5,"Confusing, but Two Different Versions of this CD","The song title listing on this page is inaccurate in that the oldest version of this CD (1988) has ""Wilderness Lost"" as the 11th song...not ""The Dream"". Both songs are beautiful, but I absolutely love ""Wilderness Lost"" all by itself, actually. In a way it stands out like a sore thumb on the CD because it has a Orson Welles-type narrator lamenting the fall of creation at the hands of the evil of humanity, then he drifts away as the songbirds reenter the scene. It sounds like something out of a sci-fi flick (vignette from Kurosawa's ""Dreams""?) and I still count it as one of my ""Replayables"" (a song I can listen to over and over and over for who knows how long?!). So, be alert as to the different songs before you purchase your edition of the outstandingly beautiful ""Harmony"" from Dan Gibson."
2,rama's review,"i have not read the contents of this book , but as per the book's title , it looks quite good , if this book contains all the concepts of solaris like system management , dns , afs , nfs , nis , nis+, device management , kernel tuning , and all administrator daily activities then it will be really good"
5,Volume 2 of the Celtic Christmas Series is awesome,"Volume 2 of the Celtic Christmas Series is awesome. If you have any or all of the other albums in this series, you have to get this one. Like all the others, the moods of the album range from mellow to exuberant, from wanting to sit & meditate to wanting to get up & dance. Yet this album in itself is as unique as the rest. It has familiar tunes like the 'Star of County Down' & new haunting melodies like 'The Dove's Return'. It completes the set of wonderous Celtic music found in the series. I highly recommend it."
2,Where's the Christmas!,"Beautiful listening but badly named. The only seasonal piece on the album was James Galway's arrangement of the Wexford Carol. There are songs about fish, unrequited love, the Great Famine, defeat in battle... heaps of Celtic stuff well worth listening to, but not if you want holiday music. For midwinter celebration you'd do well to give this album a miss and try Celtic Christmas III instead."
1,INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED,"After listening to several other Celtic Christmas music selections on the web, I purchased the Celtic Christmas, Celtic Christmas II and Celtic Christmas III CDs. I'm here to tell you, I am VERY VERY VERY disappointed. The marketing geniuses at Windham Hill did an excellent job at creating these BOGUS Christmas CDs. They could just as easily named them Songs of Easter, or Songs of Summer Vacation or Songs of Thanksgiving. Of course, they'd have to rename a couple of the songs, but you'd never know it. I'd rate this a MINUS 5 STARS if I could. Don't buy either of these CDs unless you are looking for some off the wall type of Christmas music."
2,"I love Rocky, but not these",I got these boots for Christmas and had to send them back soon after putting them on. They fir very awkwardly and were too uncomfortable. It felt like there was enough padding and they were well constructed. They just felt really weird on my foot. I opulent walk easily in these boots.
2,Comfortable and leaked,I bought these boots for work. I ended up returning this product. The tongue in the right boot did not fold properly and hurt my ankle. The right boot also leaked at the toe.P.S. I replaced these boots with some Keen steel toed boots <3 'em!
1,Uncomfortable,I bought this at the beginning of my third trimester I don't know if it's a combo of the third trimester uncomforts or just the sling but my baby hated it. It seemed like he was being smashed or something.
3,Good for wintertime clothes,This did provide comfortable support but the straps that go around your neck were way to visible at the collars of my shirts. They were snug against my neck so that they couldn't help but show. I had to return it because I just couldn't wear it with summer shirts. It would be fine in the winter with a turtleneck.I bought another one instead that is called Mother-to-Be and it does a great job giving my belly the needed support.
1,Don't Waste your Money!,"I was very excited to try this product. This is my second pregnancy, and my first daughter weighed 10 lbs 6 ozs, and I am not a very big woman. This pregnancy has been rough, my body seems to be worn out, and to beat it all, I work at a hospital and am on my feet for 12-13 hours a day. I thought the cradle would help, but it is just a jumble of elastic. It does not support like it claims and I did not even notice ANY difference in having it on. AND, you can see it under your top, I wore mine with my scrub tops and I peeped out of the shoulder area and all day people asked what it was. Not cool:-( Buyer beware...save your money!!!"
2,looks better on screen,"We had great hopes for this -- because my wife's belly was hurting toward the end of the day. We waited anxiously for the mail delivery and kicked ourselves for not shipping it overnight.Upon trying it out, the belt was too tight to be comfortable sitting (even though my wife was in the lower end of the weight range for the size she ordered). This presented the problem -- when going out shopping, do you wear it or not?? It can't be easily removed. so we ended up not using it, and wish we never had purchased it. It helped somewhat when standing -- if that is all you do all day. But for the average person, there must be a better designed belt."
2,Sizing Inaccurate,"I very much looked forward to the support of this cradle during my twin pregnancy. They don't seem to be sized for petite women; rather taller women with long torsos. I tried two different sizes and neither fit appropriately for me. Both fit well through the shoulders but were baggy through the middle, thus not supportive, even in late term. Alas, I returned the cradle for a full refund."
4,lch,I bought this for my wife. She's 7 months along and teaches so she's on her feet for about 5 hrs a day. She was having a lot of discomfort and this cradle really seems to have helped. Her only complaint is that its not that breathable so it gets a little sweaty on warm days. Still a great product though!
4,CA mom,I used it during the day. I found it very helpful to support my back. And I found it difficult to get in and out of the support belt.
2,Not worth the money..............,"I bought this thinking it will help with my back, but it's very uncomfortable to wear, especially during the summer time."
2,not adjustable,"A few other reviews mentioned that the height fit them, but the waist did not (or the other way around). I was hoping it wouldn't be this way for me since most of the reviews were positive, but it was - height was perfect, but the waist was too tight. Oh well. I was already 7 months along when I began using it, so maybe it would have helped more if I had started using it from earlier in the pregnancy? It aggravated the pain I was trying to alleviate, so I ended up returning it and using a velcro adjustable one."
3,I really wanted to love this support belt...,"I am having twins and my back has been killing me lately. I read so many good reviews about this belt I had high hopes, but I just couldn't wear it for longer than a few hours.Pros: When standing, it does hold the belly up, which did relieve pressure from my back.Cons: Unfortunately there were more cons than pros....first I had to safety pin the top straps to my bra so they didn't show. I thought this could have been designed a little better--even with more modest tops it would show through. Second, I thought the part that goes below your belly should have been a little wider. Whenever I sat down it folded/cut into me. So now instead of a backache I had stomach pain where it would cut into me. I feel if they made it a little wider this wouldn't have happened so easily.So while this belt has a good concept (and I was really really really hoping this would be the answer to my back issues), it is not for everyone."
1,"Prenatal Cradle , Enough with my Pregnancy worries !","Although the idea is good, the prenatal cradle has to be modified in many aspects:This product was not made thinking about fashionable and practical pregnant women.If you live in a hot weather,clothing is light and does not cover all your body,therefore,the prenatal cradle will show up either from one side or the other!!!!!!! (specially if you are proud of your new body and use low rise pants or short t-shirts)it also can be seen through your clothing because the cradle is white and made of a thick material. It is one added worry,every time I have to dress up for work, workout or just going out, I have to spend a long time thinking how to cover it. I am dissapointed about this product, it makes me feel frustrated."
4,Prenatal Cradle a Plus!,"My doctor told me to buy this because my back pain was so bad by my 3rd month that I couldn't stand upright without a pinching pain in my lower back. Within two days my back pain was at a tolerable level, and now I am even exercising! It is a little difficult to get on, and it shows with ALL of my maternity clothing, but it is worth it. I tightened two straps with safety pins so it is a lot more comfortable for my growing belly. This is the exact invention that I needed. With a toddler running around I couldn't be laying in bed all day. If I have any more children, I will definetly use this."
4,More helpful than anything else I tried,"I have trouble with my lower back. I just gave birth to a 10 pound baby. First I bought one of those belly bands, and that worked until about 6 months. I was crying every day and rewind pain killers and muscle relaxers to go to work on my feet. My doctor suggested this and my chiropractor seconded it. I bought it and it was a huge relief for me. I hate how it looks, I hate the material, but I would've worn anything to take the pain away."
3,"Book, the Right to Innocence","Seems a bit outdated. It clearly drove home the title ""the Right to Innocense"". I would recommend it, but it's not at the top of my list on sexual abuse recovery books."
3,Story wanders along with his travels,"Coonts travelog of his summer with the Cannibal Queen is interesting. I almost gave up mid-way through but then the story picked up again for a bit. I conected with Coonts story and could envision the small-town stopovers he made wih the Queen. Overall beig along for the ride was a nice escape... not a must read, but I have no regrets either."
5,Works great,This product has been very helpful for my French Bulldog who has a sensitive stomach. We used to give him lactobacillus about once every 10 days after which the gas would be terrible for 24 hours or so. Fastrack has eliminated the need for lactobacillus supplements and has limited the amount of gas. Be forewarned -- your dog may experience an increase in gas in the first day or two after starting Fastrack or any other probiotics. This is because the probiotics are working to get the digestive tract balanced. The gas is produced when the bad stuff is dying off. It will go away once the tract is in balance (a day or two). This size bottle lasted us almost a year for a 28 lb. dog.Note: it should be kept refrigerated.
4,Great product,This was recommended by our breeder when we picked up our 8-week old Weimaraner. We have fed him these microbials 1x daily for his first six months and have had excellent results.
4,Inspiring Young Minds,"The Oregon Scientific Smart Globe Deluxe is great in that everyone in the household is learning a lot and coming together to play with it. In the hands of my 7yr old however, after less than a month's usage, I'm already seeing wear and tear. If the electronic continue to work over time, it will be worth it. All in all, great value."
1,False advertising,"Like the other reviews, my 6 year old loves this globe, but when I went to update with Oregon Scientific's own software, it crashed. They offered to sell me a new version 3 pen for 15% off the $60 price for the pen. Outrageous. Buyer beware"
2,Do not update the pen,"We bought the delux version of the Smart Globe for my 7 year old son and it's a wonderful educational toy. However, do not update the pen via the USB connection of your computer. In our case, the pen failed during the update process and is not operational any more. when I tried to return it to Costco for a replacement, I found out that Costco does not carry the Smart Globe any more!"
1,WASTE of $$$$ DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!,"Like many reviews before me, we purchased this globe for our 7 year old from Costco. At first it was great, worked fine and was very entertaining and educational. We plugged it in using the ac/dc (with batteries still in the unit...who wouldn't do that!?) and loaded the software and went to sync up the pen with our computer. CRASH...the globe is now completely inoperable. Could be the ac/dc or the software, or both that caused it to fry. We purchase it at Costco and they do not carry it anymore. We emailed tech support at Oregon Scientific to no avail. DO not buy this junk. Now we have a VERY expensive plastic globe. NOT HAPPY!"
3,OS replaced globe free,"Like others I had trouble with this globe shortly after purchase. The pen batteries died and after replacing them the pen died. No little red light, nothing. However, unlike others I got great customer service from Oregon Scientific. They were very helpful on the phone. I explained the problem, they stated it was under warranty and needed proof of purchase, or a photo to prove I owned the globe. I emailed them the Amazon statement, and a photo. They promised me a replacement pen, but actually sent me a new globe - the most recent version in under 2 weeks. So far that one's working fine. I have not tried connecting to the internet yet, but customer service stated that many problems were caused by disconnecting the pen before it had completely updated, and to wait until the message to disconnect. As for the globe itself, my 8 year old daughter loves it, plays with it frequently and has learned a lot already."
3,Of course it's not hardcore,"I am really tired of seeing reviews of these vids complaining they are not hardcore porn. This is Amazon, folks! Amazon doesn't sell hardcore porn. So if you buy it off here, don't be shocked that it is softcore."
2,Nasal sex would be more interesting,"Agree with the the other reviewer who wasn't John. I get more turned on watching Scooby Doo (I would like to see Daphne get mounted by Scrapney or whatever his name is) than this over-stuffed Playboy menagerie.SAD.Actually it would be nice to see Jenna do some (good, not this) softcore, with someone other than a cartoon canine."
4,She is like the Phoenix Bird,"I've never a story of more personal suffering and overcoming that suffering than Nien Cheng's account. For a woman who led a fairly simple life is suddenly tossed into prison for being a ""capitalist-roader"" during the Cultural Revolution. She endures seven years of hardship while struggling to hold on to the last threads of her sanity. Only after is she released does she learn the terrible fate of her daughter, Meiping. I have never read a story more hope-inspiring and thought-provoking than Nien's. She displays such immense courage and she proves to us that if we set our minds to it, anyone can triumph over adversity such as she did."
2,Memory,"Wow. Just wow. I am so impressed with Cheng for remembering every single tiny detail of her life in China. I mean, remembering the exact words that her captors repeated to her, every single word her interrogators asked her, and then translating that into English? I'm impressed. Or at least I would be, if I believed that she could remember everything down to what color the dust was on the bottoms of her feet. This book was a required read for my group, and I was surprised at how dull of a read it was. Topping 600 pages, It would be a much more interesting read if it was chopped down to... how about 300 max? This book is so full of prejudice and angst, it can not be viewed as an objective point of view. But in the end, your memory of these tiny events (which were torturous to read) and some few larger events, are quite laudable. So good job. Thank you for telling me about what a spider looks like as it sits on its web for hours.....zzzzzz"
4,life and death in shanghai,A story that is quite exciting at time but also gives the reader a wonderful picture of life in China at that time still a worry as one suspects a lot of the same practices still happen today.
5,Read it if you want to know what a really good book is.,Author Nien Cheng has provided one of the most lurid and heart wrenching details of her experiences from a socialite in capitalist Shanghai to her painful days of undergoing 'thought reform' in China's terror driven prisons during the Cultural Revolution. Wish I could give a 6-star for this one!
5,live and die in Shanghai,"I have bought this book at least 5 years ago, I never got around to it until 6 months ago...It makes me appreciate what I have, where I live and really stop sweating the small stuff...She is a couragous woman and a great writer. Her strength can move mountain....."
2,It is interesting to read about life in China during the cultural revolution but this book is boring.,I understand that the author's plight was horrible but this goes on too long. A shorter version of the hardships in the detention center would benefit this book.
5,Read this before you land on a desert island.,"Nien Cheng transported me to a destination I never want to visit. Still, her ability to glimpse hope and cling to it and to, somehow, create life sustaining games to keep her mind active and her survivalist attitude strong mesmerized me. I kept reading this thick book about a horrific experience because she demonstrated what strength of character and postive thinking can achieve"
3,"Clear reporting, no passion","Nien Cheng reports clearly and factually, almost dispassionately. She clearly and courteously supplies all the background needed to follow her story. You really can come at this book with no knowledge of this period of Chinese history.However for the blurb to say ""a gripping, poignant chronicle"" or ""the powerful story..."" is a bit much. She tells the account with excessive caution and detachment -- odd considering the circumstances. This isn't literature and it isn't gripping. It is not a story of Nien Cheng so much as an account of China. As she says near the end, throughout this period she changed ""not one iota"". Her final words sum up her attitude, ""God knows how hard I tried to remain true to my country. But I failed utterly through no fault of my own.""It is also disappointing that her faith (early on she states that she is Christian) supplies her no comfort nor strength. If she relied on prayer at all she keeps it a secret from her readers."
2,Informative but Dull,"Nien Cheng wrote quite a bookful with this one. This book was mildly enjoyable due to the very interesting course of events about which Ms. Cheng wrote. Unfortunately, I personally found that the book really dragged on and on in the middle. I can see that this could have been done to actually reflect the mood of the situation in the middle of the book (tedious) but it seemed like a real chore, plowing through the wordy and repetitive areas (there were a lot of them). Mind you, I'm no light reader, I do often read long novels, but I dislike feeling the weight of the book holding back my enjoyment.On the positive side, the tale itself is fascinating, dealing with a dramatic and shocking imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution of China.I didn't much care for this book, but then, I don't really like biographies and I think that autobiographies are typically worse."
1,Just Horrible,This book was soooo bad.I hate my teacher right now for making us read this awful book.Its just way too boring and not interesting at all.If only it wasn't a required reading for my class I would have never had to experience this horrible book.
4,A Pillar of Strength,"Nien Cheng takes the reader through the culture revolution in China. More precisely, she shares the trial and tribulations of how a life can be turned upside down just because someone in power says so. I had a slight idea of the oppressive Chinese government during that time; however, Cheng's autobiography details the treatment she recieved in the detention camp as well as the years after her release. Her story shows that with strength and strong beliefs, a person can manage to live through a great deal. A real moving and poignant story on how a person's life can change by just a mere knock on the door."
5,Life and Death in Shanghai,I bought a second copy of this book to share because it is so well written and gives a clear picture of what went on in China during the Cultural Revolution. What a brave lady!
4,Life and death in Shanghai,This is a really excellent book. It is amazing to see how much energy and drive the woman had to survive her long imprisonment and still maintain her sanity. It is disturbing to note that things like this still go on in our time.
5,"A ""must have"" for every kitchen!","Why oh why is this timeless cookbook out of print? The fish recipes are uncomplicated yet sophisticated - likely to be found in trendy restaurants today (although the book was written in 1986). We take our ""Seafood Cookbook"" with us on vacations knowing that the ingredients will be available in most stores and that we won't have to give up hours of ""beach time"" preparing a fresh and delicious seafood dinner."
1,Don't buy it - the Self-Cleaning Part is Useless,"We bought the Whirlpool built-in oven.The third time we used the self-cleaning option, it burned up the circuit board.We found out from the repairman that Whirlpool is the absolute worst self-cleaning oven you can buy because eventually the self-cleaning option burns something up and breaks the oven.Why have a self-cleaning option if you can't use it?The repairman recommended that we buy a GE because the self-cleaning option on a GE works."
3,cool remake of the lakeside classic,not my favorite lakeside sample but it was cool and coolio was riding high at this time.
2,George Winston?,"If you like the music of George Winston's earlier albums, especially the ""seasons,"" December, Plains, Forest, Montana.....you will probably not like this one. Unfortunately, it is nothing like his earlier works. I would never have fallen in love with his music if it was all like Gulf Coast Blues. This new one is way too heavy, loud, and generally abrasive. I am very sorry to have to say these things, because I am such a big fan of his."
2,Not up to George Winston's Standard of Excellence,"I was disappointed in this CD and have only played it once. There was nothing about the music that ""grabbed"" me or even made me identify with New Orleans jazz or blues. Not what I expected, but I was still happy to contribute to the hurricane relief effort."
3,French Mood,"This is one of the classics, if you are looking for a french mood this will do it.Every home needs one."
2,What a dissapointment,"I was absolutely thrilled with volumes 1-4 in this series. This was, stylistically, more jazzy than chill. It has been a couple years since they released a chill colection. I think that after the feedback they got on this one, they gave up. Nooooo- Just bring back the producers on 1-4!"
1,Not in the same vein as previous UCs,"I have all of the Ultra Chilled series and while I usually enjoy 80% of the music on those collections, with about half of that entering my permanent rotation, there were only three songs in this version that I could even sit through.Those were the tracks done by Jon Hopkins, Bent, and Federico Aubele. The rest were not strictly chill, dreadful as music and some were depressing (a few tracks regarding death, including one where the singer is ""waiting for suicide"" or some such angst).There is a bit of jazz, electronica, blues, dance and alternative music in Ultra Chilled 05, but little chill and nothing exemplary."
1,Not like the others,"I just wanted to reiterate the other one stars... if you liked the first UCs, then you may be disappointed. The emphasis seems far less on electronica and more on an eclectic mix of low key music. Some of it isn't bad, but I feel like someone stuck a lot of remakes of old jazz songs into what had once been a compilation series of forward looking trance/electronica, etc."
1,Misleading,"While this book would be useful as a reference, it is difficult to read straight through. This however is not the real problem. The real issue is that the book applies to the retired exam (9E0-569), not the current exam (9E0-402). Unfortunately, this little parcel of information is not written on the cover, but instead on one of the introductory pages, making it impossible to know this when you are ordering the book online. The worst thing is that this book was actually published after the exam it covers was retired. Why Cisco would release a book on 01/15/2002 when the exam it pertains to was retired more than 2 months earlier is beyond me. As you might guess, I am not particularly pleased to have discovered all of this after I had already purchased the book."
4,9E0-402,"While I passed the 9E0-402 exam, after 3 weeks of reading this book. I am giving it 4 stars, because I found out in the exam, the book missed out on some details. However with work experience, you should be able to pass the exam with this book. I am not working with IP Telephony at the moment, so I will say I got a good bargain for my money. I aslo used Boson test, but the questions were too easy compared to the real thing, personally not worth buying. To pass the exam read this book twice, and you should be ready. I am willing to answer any questions regarding the exam prep."
1,Don't bother.,"This book is poorly put together, dry, repetative, and does a very poor job of explaning the material. Whatever good there is in it seems verbatim from Cisco's web site.Save your money."
3,Not sufficient for IP telephony certification,This book does not cover all the topics probed in the exam.Needs to be updated and aligned with the latest Cisco IP Telephony Certification Exam.
2,Very hard to read and understand. May not be what you want!!,"I am preparing for CIPT exam. I thought this was the preparation guide for CIPT. I was hoping that this book goes in depth analysis of all components of CIPT clearly. In my opinion, this book is short of explaining VoIP protocols. It needs a little more elaboration on the fundamentals. For example, I read about clusters in this book. I was very much confused. Then I read about the same subject in Cisco CallManager Fundamentals. It was actually a streightforward concept. All discriptions in the book are confusing, and insufficient. I vote strongly against this book if you are planning to buy this book only because you are preparing for the CIPT test. It might be a good reference for using the CallManager menus."
1,What Exam is this for?,The current exam for CIPT is 9E0-402 - in the first few pages of this book it states that this book is for CIPT exam 9E0-569...the recently retired CIPT exam!!! What is the story here?? The book just came out and it is already out of date?
3,Rough Start &#65533; But Moving Forward,"When I first opened this book I knew html pretty good and did not understand this book at all.... It has taken well over 24 hours and I had to find coding off the internet to see live working examples but once I got a look at how PHP worked, I am whipping through this book. It's a good book if you have dabbled around in PHP but really had no idea what you were doing,"
3,Good Introduction but needs more editing.,"This book gives a great introduction to PHP4, programming concepts and structure, and Database integration. It was very easy to follow and well designed as far as how it led to more difficult concepts.My real beef with this book, is it *should* be called ""PHP4, Edited in 24 hours.""There are NUMEROUS type-o errors, ESPECIALLY in the code examples. If one was not more attentive, it would cause errors that may discourage the user new to programming.It also remains pretty basic, and is a GREAT starter, but it doesn't go in-depth enough for my tastes."
2,Too many typos,"This book has way too many typos that are confusing. Unless you are an experienced programmer, the errors will throw you off. Also there is not a list of errata on the Sam's Web site for this book. The book has a lot of potential, it is organized well but the author uses too much jargon for a newbie and the typos are downright annoying."
1,Dont buy this book..unless you want to waste your time,this book is not the one to get if you want to learn PHP. I bought it on impulse before checking out the others from Wrox or from Julie Meloni. Professional PHP programming is a good basic one if you know some basics of PHP.
4,Awsome Book!,"I'm still reading this book, but it has helped me out a lot already in the PHP arena. The book has great examples, quizzes and activities to make sure that you are getting the point of each hour (chapter). The only bad thing I can say is that the book does have some minor layout problems, but you can just over look those. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to start scripting in PHP. **Side note - the book covers Unix based installs of PHP4. If you want to install PHP4, MySQL and Apache on your Windows machine go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptriad/ and download their install program."
2,Sams Teach Yourself PHP,"This book is definately not for the new programmer. It is written in Geek and for a Sams teach yourself not very well presented. I have been using the Sams books for a number of years and not had the difficulty with the comprehension. As a refrence book there is a substantial number of better publications, all of which should be consulted before wasting money on this volume. The volume I have is the Second Edition Published in 2001."
3,OK,"I think the book was OK, just OK. It was well-explained, and is good if you need an answer to a basic question.However throughout the book i saw frequent spelling mistakes, and invalid examples, and contradiction when he explained things and then what he later said.It got so bad that when i was half-way through i couldn't fully trust the book and so discovered the best resource there is, the official website at php.net.The book left out alot of functions that are necessary for alot of coding in the language too. But you can't expect all the functions to be in there.This book is good if your new to PHP, but i would suggest you buy another book, such as the o'reilly published book on PHP by Rasmus Lerdorf. I've spoken to him on the official php.net irc server and he helped co-create the language.Don't buy this book, there are plenty more books out there that provide what this book does and more, and that isn't as rushed as this one."
4,"Pretty good, but SLOPPY mistakes","Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, technically sound, and well organized. In fact I recommend it to anyone with some programming and HTML background.But how HARD is it to write a book free from errors??!! Some of the errors are just irritating typos, but some are far more dangerous. In a few places I was actually taught a concept incorrectly (evil of evils!!), and was only set straight later in the book when the author actually taught it correctly. I don't think this guy actually went back and reviewed his own book, if he had, he'd have caught the errors.sorry for negativity, it's a good book, but I hate errors, especially when they occur a lot in a programming book."
2,"Allright, but not reccomended","I havent even finished the book yet, and I have found about 5 mistakes in it. Some of these mistakes are at very key concepts, and if a new php programmer doesnt pick up these mistakes, and think they are right... there is going to be problems.I would wait for a revised copy of this book to be available before you purchase..."
3,Good book spoiled by typos,"The topics here are explained in plain English and are easy to follow. All the basics of PHP4 are covered along with some more advanced topics towards the back. My main gripe with the book is all the type errors. Do 'Sams' test these books out on anyone before publishing? When learning a new language or just taking those first steps, typos are a real hinderence and I wasted lots of time figuring out what they were, although it could be argued that I gained experience at de-bugging! Worth the asking price but you'll still need another book to go at."
3,"Inconveniences and Errors, but still a Good Book","Most technical books have web sites provide their examples for downloading. This book has a lot of useful examples, but compels the reader to type nearly all of them. The SAMS website has only two chapters worth of examples. There are well more than 20 chapters in the book. If SAMS really wants this to be a book that can be done in 24 1-hour sessions, then they are to be faulted for not making sure all of the examples are available to the reader in electronic format.One complete section was technically incorrect. The book explains that the isset() function can be used to determine if a given page is being parsed as a POST or a GET page. The author incorrectly says that the variable $HTTP_POST_VARS is only set when handling a POST page. In fact, on my Apache 1.3.17 server (the current version), this variable is also set on GET pages.So, this book has inconveniences and some errors. But most of it is good and the examples provided help tremendously."
4,Travel the World in 60 minutes!,"With this older Solitudes album you can literally travel the world in 1 hour...from Japan, to the Arctic Circle, to the North Atlantic to Hawaii--accompanied by all sorts of beautiful whales and music that is sometimes soothing...sometimes energizing and engaging.One artistical endeavor the makers of this album took were to spontaneously create the music...and it works so well to the effect that at times you can't discern an instrument from a sound of nature! It's very interesting...and worth listening to.Along the way of your journey you'll become friends with beluga whales, killer whales (or orcas), narwhales (like belugas with marbled skin and males with a ""tusk""), and everyone's favorite...the Humpback.I am very fond of the sounds of the breaking and floating ice on track #2...accompanied by the sounds of red-throated loons; it transports me to Northern Alaska."
4,To go into deep sleep...,"Ever since I rediscovered it in my CD collection, we've been playing this album to help soothe our baby and it's done wonders... but not only to him, but to us too! Beside being the musical trip another reviewer described, it is a great new age album that takes you into deep relation mode. Highly recommended after a stressful day at work or simply to chill out."
4,Page turner..,"I found myself engrossed in the book by the third chapter. This author has written a book that is not just science fiction, but also historical. I like the way he combined the two. My favorite parts were the chapters involving the pirates and the love affair of Julia and Webb. The letter at the end brought tears to my eyes. It was a very well conceived and written book. For a first novel, I would rate it 4 to 5 stars, but thought 4 would be appropriate. Can't wait for books 2 and 3!"
5,If only it could be sold in Thailand . . .,"I live in Thailand and when attempting to find out about this book, every website that mentioned it was censored by the Royal Thai Police as being a threat to national security. So much for 'Thailand' being translated as the 'Land of the Free.'The book was well researched and illuminating. It is a great shame that Thais are kept ignorant of their own history since the Ayuthaya Period. So many of the subjects discussed in this book might as well have happened on the far side of the moon: they are not taught in Thai schools. The unfortunate result is xenophobia and ignorance. The 'sakdina system' of feudalism continues in this oligarchy and knowledge is reserved for the priveledged.If this book could be published in Thai, it would be a boon to democracy here."
1,Kinda fake research!,Just read the book and I have to say it's fun to read as a light reading but don't take anything serious out of it.the content is bias and not enough supporting fact.a lot of info can be found on Internet and that's not proof if it's all true.found his so called research to be wrong too.and you can find out the true easily if u visiting Thailand once.I don't think this book is worth your the money.
3,Que?,Bought this as a present for someone and had it sent to them. Not sure why I'm being asked to review it.Long Live The King.
2,The bottom line.,"The bottom line is that if you're not Thai, you will never fully understand our love for the king. We never talk bad about the king because we love him like a father and we take pride in knowing our leader is better than yours. Thais may smile a lot, but we are not so ignorant as to think people can be perfect and we should worship them blindly. There have been many scandals dealing with the royal family and many jokes made within Thai homes. All you need to know is that Thais love their king, because they choose to, not because of propoganda. We love him, because he loves us. We love him more than you farangs, because he loves us more, We can see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice, and feel it in his presence. Why would we point out his shortcomings when he has done so much good. It is like Thai idea of ""kraeng chai"" to the fullest. Westerners do not have this term. I'll leave it at that.p.s. Why is Handley's research so highly credited by you folk?"
2,flawed and biased,"For anyone already familiar with the Thai monarchy, the holes in Handley's work are two obvious and too numerous for it to be taken seriously. It's hard to believe it passed Yale editorial.Many of the aspects of the monarchy are spun in a ethnocentrically negative light. The same aspects seen from the typical Thai perspective are in fact oftimes positive.The definitive Bhumibol bio has yet to be written."
1,Truthful opinion from a common Thai,"This book is very fake book. The author pained the black color to the King Bhumipol biography through his very negative mind. Mr.Handley is too disqualified to claim himself like the profesional journalist or for writing the professional work. As he put his worst intention to exaggerate for authoring this book and almost parts of this book are distorted out of the fact. I would like to appeal the publishing company to stop printing this book and heartly recommend, so please, do not waste your valuable money for this fake book. There is no any usefulness from this book. In fact, I would like to rate this book as ""zero"" or ""negative point"", but, there is no option for this."
5,The King Never Smiles,"Very well researched and extremely informative. The only book I've read which 'pulls no punches' about the Thai Royal Family, and can be highly critical - it will certainly be banned in Thailand! I was surprised the book contained no photographs. A family tree of the present Royal Family and their ancestors would also have been enormously useful."
4,Absolutely worthwhile to read,"I have traveled to Thailand many times as a tourist and have to admit falling victim to the image of the king that is projected within the country. This books gives a detailed analysis of how this image was built and how it is used to maintain modern day Thailand. There is a LOT of detail in this book...more than I needed to know. It seemed very thorough. There was some redundancy. I had problems remembering all of the long Thai names presented in this book. But, in the end, it didn't matter. The book seems to hold a lot of truths that were not accessible to me elsewhere. I will no longer travel to Thailand as the naive tourist but will now understand the machinations behind the facade. Thank you for a very good read."
4,Informative,"Having visited Thailand and traveled a bit, we were interested in the royal family. That information isn't readily available. We found it informative."
1,WPOS (Worthless Piece of ...),"I bought two. Tried to install the first one, over-tightened and broke. Tried to install the second, being extra careful not to over-tighten it -- it would either leak or break. Buy a different filter."
3,Iconic cookbook from the San Francisco restaurant.,Beautifully presented recipes from the restaurant. Well written with beautiful photography. A must have for the well-rounded cookbook collection. Zuni!
5,Daughter very pleased with this cookbook,Our daughter asked for this cookbook for Christmas as her boyfriend's mother recommended it. She was very pleased with the gift. It is a lovely high-quality book.
2,"Not bad, but......","Not bad, but I don't think I'm qualified to prepare these recipes! As stated before, It's great for a more professional cook/chef. I, too, like to see a picture of the dish before I make it, and there are no pictures in this book.That being said, I did enjoy reading it, and learned a lot of new ideas and methods."
1,My Own Fault,"Alas, it's my own fault for buying a cookbook it turns out I'll probably never use. Seduced by a review in a major publication, I broke my two self-imposed rules about buying cookbooks. Never buy one by a chef and/or restaurant owner and never buy without looking first. But the review was so warm and enthusiastic, I went straight to my computer and ordered it. Would that I had read both the reviewers' and readers' comments first. Then I would have known I would not be at all interested in the first 52 pages. Having cooked simple but good food for almost half a century, there's not much I don't know about kitchen tools and basic techniques. Judy Rodgers is, indeed, a good writer, but if I want to read about one's formative years in the cooking field, I'll look for a memoir. Then, too, there's the early salting recommendation which informs many of the recipes. I strive to reduce sodium in my cooking, not increase it. Perhaps I shall give it to a daughter or daughter-in-law."
1,Very disappointing.,"I received this book as a Christmas present from my husband. I am interested in healthy eating & cooking. This book does not fit into that category. He ordered it based on a review from our newspaper, which I also read & stated that it sounded like an interesting book. It is not!"
2,I'll Make 10% of These Recipes,"I received this cookbook as a gift from someone who thought it was about Southwestern cooking (as in Zuni Indians - actually, the food is mostly Mediterranean). I am not in the restaurant or food business, nor am I a personal friend of the author's.Undoubtedly, Zuni Café is a wonderful restaurant experience. But, if like me, you are a home cook with limited access to quail, various imported Italian goodies, and glasswort, etc., etc., etc., forget this book. Much of it is just too dang precious.Precious also is the language. Like the author, I have spent significant time in France and speak French at near-native level. However, I really question her use of French (sometimes Italian)when English will do - example: ""restes"" for leftovers. The impression is one of insecurity or a need to elevate herself and her recipes.The book is a giant step backwards to someone like Narcisse Chamberlain - eurocentric cooking for Americans."
4,chicken recipe is well worth the price,"zuni is my favorite san francisco restaurant. i bought this book for the chicken recipe, the restaurant signature dish; it works perfectly and satisfies a life long goal of making a perfect roast chicken. have only glanced at other recipes."
4,Bunch of laughs,"Although not as clever as his first book, ""Politically Correct Bedtime Stories"" it still made me laugh and it brought a new light to the classics.If your thinking about buying this book and you don't have ""Politically Correct Bedtime Stories"" don't buy it, get ""Politically Correct Bedtime Stories.&quot"
3,"Great ingredients, poor bubbles and high price tag","I love that California Baby is all natural and the smell is great. My main complaint is that it is super pricey for just bubble bath/wash and you have to use a TON just to get any sort of bubbles going in the tub (and this is a modest amount I am talking about). Before I knew it, the bottle was gone in a week and at this price, I just can't afford to use it. If it were just a little bit cheaper or even if you only had to use 1/2 of what you normally would to get some bubbles in the bath, I would most definitely continue to purchase this because I do love that the ingredients are less harmful to my girls."
3,Master's Violin....Old fashioned wisdoms,"This simple little love story is full of wisdom. It is meant to be read slowly, as perhaps one could, in the early 1900's. Each page has somethng of meaning within it's words and although our world is busier and more cynical now, joy and sorrow mingle on the pages of this book just as they do now.I love the common sense of the writer and smile at the ""rules of propriety"" deemed necessary to live the ""proper"" life she portrays.This is an old-fashioned story written quaintly but with much charm. It's something your Mother or Grandmother might have read as a young girl. It's a treasure."
5,So much more than just another country song,"He lures you into it. The first time you hear his songs you might not appreciate the poetry. But after a while, you begin to sing the lines to yourself. And the poetry is deeper and more universal than you thought the first time around. I don't think I'm the only one who knows people like Lorraine, who has ""been thinking of joining a movement, but doesn't really know what she's for"". And then there's the stunning honesty of ""Town Too Tough to Die"", where Darryl Rush grew up and he remembers not just the town but the ""black dirt gumbo"" and the ""acres and acres of milo and cotton"" and ""the days before he ran away from a town too tough to die"". I can't stop my leg from tappin and I can't stop singing Darryl's songs. Good poetry is like that."
1,Too much bias by the author,I could barely get through the first two chapters of this book as I found the author's views intruding too much. As to what to do about such humans I am never a supporter of the death penalty as it is uncivilized so life without parole is just fine.
5,Crystal Method is back: A must have,"If you are a fan of techno/trance/dance, this music will not disappoint you. The first track sets the pace and you are taken on a journey that culminates with one of the best tracks on the album, 1979. There are 1-2 selections in the middle that I thought were boring but, overall, this album is a gem.Buy it and you will keep it playing as I do. Never mind the neighbours--Its crystal method!!!!"
5,"If there is such a method, it IS the Crystal Method....","How surprised was I to see a new release for TCM when browsing amazon! Went right out and bought it that night and has not left my CD player since. I first thought it was slow in picking up, but once track 5 hit (The Doors), it caught me.....and then track 6 was just sick.....one of my favorite tracks on this album. After that, the rest flowed consistently running thru track 16 (pumpkins) which is a very nice remix of 1979! There isn't really much I can tell you except to get the album. It is a GREAT compilation and especially following the great Community Service 1 album, it won't disappoint. Also, if you ever get a chance to see these guys on tour, by all means, get a ticket. I went to the Legion of Boom tour last year and the remixes of Busy Child and Keep Hope Alive was unlike anything I can put into words. Needless to say, the energy was felt!!!! Can't wait for TCM's new album to hit again! Keep it up guys!"
3,so-so,"I am a big fan of TCM, but I was kinda disappointed after listening to this album. And not that it is that bad, some of the songs, like #2 & #7 are great....but overall I got too much noise and not enough good beat and music. In my opinion it lacks balance and it's certainly no match for any of TCM's previous albums."
3,A mixed bag,"I really don't go for the remixes of Doors, Evil Nine, Dylan Rhymes, New Order, or Smashing Pumpkins. For one thing, I'm not really a fan of that music, to begin with. Beyond that, I really think most of those mixes just didn't come out very well. I'm also not big on tracks 13 or 14, or some of the vocal samples scattered throughout the other tracks (especially the otherwise impressive track 10).As a point of reference, I'd rate Vegas (the only other TCM album I own) a 4. In electronic music, my tastes range from older Chem Bros, older Orbital, and Kruder & Dorfmeister, to RJD2 and Dieselboy. I only mention that, because the large number of 5-star reviews mislead me, slightly. So, maybe it will be of some use to someone in determining why my reaction differs from so many others.Anyhow, balancing out this album are some good beats and some very infectious riffs. In fact, a few of the tracks do work quite well."
4,whatever,this is a great mix. and to say it doesn't compare w/ Legion of Boom just shows that you dont know this music very well. Legion of Boom was garbage. this is the first interesting album i've heard from them since vegas.
4,A DISTANT CHALLANGE,THE BOOK TOLD OF AREAS THAT I. PERSONALLY WAS DEPLOYED TO FIGHT THE ENEMY.IT MENTIONED 2 OF OUR GUYS THAT I HAVE KEPT IN CONTACT WITH THRU THESE MANY YEARS AND HELPED ME REMEMBER FIREFIGHTS WE WERE ENGAGED INTO.A GOOD READ MAYBE A LITTLE EXAGGERATED AT 1 POINT BUT I AM NOT SURE BECAUSE I WAS NOT IN THAT PARTICULAR ENGAGEMENT.BUT ALL IN ALL A GOOD READ FOR ME.THE CONDITION OF THE BOOK WAS NOT VERY GOOD BUT YOU CAN TELL IT HAS BEEN READ MANY TIMES WHICH IS GOOD.
5,Entertaining and Ineteresting,"I was 17 the first time I saw SOM in 1965 and I still get a thrill everytime the camera pans to Maria and she starts singing. Having seen the movie countless times I was excited to get this book! I thought at first that knowing about how the film was made would take away some of the magic. However this has not been the case. Informative ( would you believe Gene Kelly turned down being the director!) and the names of some of the actors who were considered for parts will really surprise you. If you are a die hard SOM fan then the price of this book is well worth every penny. Not a fan? Buy it anyway, a good read on how a film is made and how success can be measured not only by the money a movie can make, but by the hearts it touches as well!"
4,A Must Read,"This book was very interesting. It is what every ""Sound of Music"" fan should read, if they are at all interested in how the movie got made. The behind-the-scenes stories are wonderful. What I thought was interesting was who was considered for the leads--can you imagine Sean Connery as the Captain??? ack! Or Walter Matthau as Max? To think that the best cast came in at just the right time and that it produced one of the best loved musicals of all time. If one thing had been off, think of what a different movie would have been made.I was especially interested in reading the sections on the REAL von Trapp family and their story. Maria really was a powerhouse in keeping her family the way she wanted it. The pictures were beautiful and the background material (sketches, notes, etc.) were wonderful to see.A must read for any ""Sound of Music"" fan."
5,Great Book for All movie-goers;you will LOVE this one ! AA++,"Very well written book. A must have for all ' Music, ' fans!"
5,very good hiking boot,I have bought my second pair after I wore out my first pair. They are lightweight and probably more suited for day hikes and short backpacks rather than extended trips. waterproof and only problem I had was the toe seam started to come unglued and a quick trip to shoe repair and $6 fixed me up. I really like these boots and are the most comfortable hiking boot I have ever owned and I am 63 and have been hiking over 40 years
1,Misleading Title - I fell for it too.,"I guess I wasn't the only one mislead by the title then. I suppose I should have waited for or found a better description, but I never would have assumed that the phrase ""Adult Edition"" refers to two previous novels being crammed together and sold as one. I have little to add to what has already been said by another reviewer; I mostly wanted to vent my frustrations.I would, however, like to encourage anyone who hasn't read the first two Georgia Nicolson books to give them a try. They really are very good, very funny. And bonus, you now have the option to choose between two small books or one big book."
4,He can do no wrong.,"I'll admit to being biased to Nitin Sawney, to the extent that I think the guy can do no wrong (virtually) - this album, just as good- while the lyrics are kinda vacuous compared to 'Prophesy', ""Philtre"" (means medicine, or something) is essentially a feel-good album in an entirely non-vacuous sense- and the better material, as always, is the stuff without vocals or lyrics.How does this guy do it? He continually comes up with not just new material, but new approaches- there's no way to differentiate between the flamenco, the drum & bass, the hiphop and the IDM/middle-eastern themes - everything combines to one tune.Not his best work - he seems too settled now to bring up the subtler emotions and confusion of 'Beyond Skin' but still wonderful music- just more restful than his previous performances.m@"
3,Carving the Female Face :How -To Carve Pretty Faces in Wood,"I almost bought this book hoping it would give me the necessary missing elements for my smaller faces .I got to preview it at a woodworking show .Glad I did because ,though it is great for an individual to learn to do a mouth ,nose, eyes ect. it is somewhat lacking in showing the technique and how to put it all together .A great book for someone needing to know how to go about doing the individual elements of the face but left me feeling like I needed much more than there was offered here ."
4,One Wintry Night,"The illustrations are absolutely delightful - each full of color and magnificent detail. The story is a full summary of the Biblical account for salvation in the context of Christmas, starting with Creation, through the Old Testament, to Jesus. It's good reading for young ones who are learning these Truths; yet a little too much detail for more mature readers. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and getting lost in the illustrations! I highly recommend this book!"
5,Best Christmas book ever made,"We received this as a gift when my daughter was 6 and absolutely loved it.It quickly became tradition to pull it out every Christmas and read it and mull overthe brilliantly done illustrations. My daughter discovered that the artist hid catsand roly polys in most of the pictures, so we had fun looking for those and noticingall the intricacies of the paintings. It took the artist five years to illustrate and each oneis a masterpiece. The story is brilliantly done as well and takes the readerthrough the Bible from the beginning to Christ's birth. My daughter is now 23 and stillpulls the book out every year as part of our decorating. We still enjoy sitting by the treelooking through the book. Every family should have this book."
5,Wonderful book about Jesus' birth,Such a great description of the real meaning of Christmas. It will be a Christmas ritual at our house for years to come
2,Misleading title,"When buying this book I was very interested in learning which are some key cultural differencies with moral implications and the title of this book promised to provide me such information.However I found that the real subject is the Relativistic approach versus the Ethnocentric one: which is mainly, from my point of view, a discussion between two philosophical parties without supporting the real matter."
2,Wish I would have waited ...,"I purchased this swing a few months before my daughter was actually born. When I needed to use the swing, I opened the box, and unfortunately the swing didn't work. The music played and it was super cute. It just didn't work no matter what we tried. We changed the batteries and fiddled with it a bit. I ended up just donating a brand new swing to Goodwill and having to purchase another because so much time had elapsed since I purchased it. I would definitely recommend that you purchase from a local store and closer to the time you will actually be needing the swing. :)"
5,Essential for Any Silent Hill Superfan.,"This is NOT a game. It's a collection of media relating to the world of Silent Hill. This includes a comic book, pictures from the games, some art, interviews with some of the game's makers (including musical genius Akira Yamaoka), and a selection of music from games 1-4.If you're crazy in love with Silent Hill, and you have a PSP, then this one's a no-brainer. Buy it and love it, or Pyramid Head will drag you away."
3,JUST FOR SILENT HILL FANS !!,"THIS IS JUST FOR DIE HARD SILENT HILL FANS !! THIS IS NOT A GAME, IT'S JUST A DOCUMENTARY FOR THE SERIES."
3,Buy it for the music,"This psp title is great for silent hill fans. This is not a game, but rather a ""best of"" from other silent hill titles. The best reason to buy is the soundtracks from all previous silent hill games. The experience includes clips from silent hill 2 etc. nice, animation of a comic book and an interview with the creator."
4,Great product -- IF you're a Silent Hill fan,"This is NOT a game. Some people seem to think it is. Just remember that it's a UMD, which basically means it's a video. It's got interactive menus, which are pretty cool, and set in the school of Silent Hill. Creepy atmosphere, exclusive videos and comics make this a very cool addition to your collection.There are a few problems, such as in the sound track area, you cannot ""play all,"" and must go back to the list every time and select the next song. I usually don't listen to the entire Silent Hill soundtrack, though, so this isn't that big a deal. The comics also are not as good as the box makes them sound, but that is just my opinion.All in all, this is a very good addition to any Silent Hill fan's collection. However, I would not say that this is a must-have by any means. If you like the series, I recommend it. If you're new to the series, then I recommend playing the games first; a lot of this game would not be very interesting. Yet."
1,Not worth the money,Comics are ok but the narration passes by too quickly. The rest is blah. I was under the impression that this would show the origin of pyramid head and more of how Silent Hill became what it is.
3,Silent Hill Experience,"If your not a big silent hill fan like me, don't purchase this. If you are a fan this is a great UMD."
5,looks good so maybe...,"i just ordered this but no i do not have a psp yet, but im going to buy that next. I bought this because it sounded interesting and strange and ive seen clips of all the recent games and saw the movie so I figured what the heck? right? so we shall see"
4,Top Form,"Battles know what they're doing. They didn't come into this deal with that adolescent inexperience and uncertainty of what direction to take. Their former musical projects already have them at the top of their game, and their sound was patented to a tee from the very first recording. I put off buying this EP for awhile; I was wary of 'Fantasy' because of their other underwhelming electronic blip-and-bleat tracks such as 'Uw' and 'Bttls'. As it turns out, the track isn't half-bad, especially on headphones. Also, 'Tras' is probably Battles' most accessible track, with a rock propulsion that makes it instantly palatable. Not a bad buy at all, especially if you already have the other EPs. I can't wait for future releases. Oh wait, I forgot about the 'Tras' video. I was disappointed, because I was expecting a live performance, but instead I got this white-washed recording that reminded me of a Macintosh commercial."
2,Not worth it,"2 1/2Terrible gamble for anyone except the biggest fans simply due to the horrible consistency of getting only one track that resembles the exciting qualities inherent with the groups way better work, and another long track that plays like a lazy beat-fest session of uninspired undertaking. Strictly for those familiar and engaged with everything else Battles have put out"
5,Work great,These worked out great and are very durable. The key fits snug and makes it easy when your using it.
5,Not Bored By The Chairmen,"I first heard Chairmen of the Board on the Invictus Soul Box Set. Why weren't these guys famous? This is incredible Motown soul. Acid, fuzzClav. Hypertight, bassdrum heavy rhythm. Wah-wah guitar. Soulful harmonies reminicent of the Tops or Temps. Above all: great songwriting (some courtesy of Motown's legendary Holland-Dozier-Holland hitmakers).If you like funk, if you like soul, if you like Motown, you gotta get this excellent set.[DW]"
5,Opens up a whole new world!,"This CD opened up a whole new world for me. Now, I cant wait to answer the phone, and PRAY that it's a telemarketer. What a blast. The title tells it all. Now get *your* revenge."
4,a good comedy CD for rush hour traffic,"If you like Roy D Mercer or any other prank callers then you will like this CD. Tom does a good job on keeping the telemarketers on the phone as long as he does. There are some tracks on the CD that are not so funny but over all the CD is good. I really like the one where the carpet cleaning compnay calls and wants to sell services. Tom tells them that he just shot a family member and he needs someone to come and clean it up. He hangs up and they call back and he tells them he was just shaving and it got out of hand. Unlike Roy Mercer, Tom does not tell the callers that this is a joke and he shouldnt."
4,Hilarious!,"I heard Tom on the Radio once and thought I got to hear the rest of this guys stuff. I wasn't disappointed! This Cd had me laughing incessantly for weeks. I admit it does get old with time but I think it will always bring a smile to my face and at least of ""Humph"" no matter how much I listen to it."
3,Be forewarned,There are a lot of explicit matters on this CD and you should be aware it is not fit for family entertainment. It is also not as good as the clips make it sound. It actually gets old quickly.
2,It's OK but...,"The guy kind of crosses the line to obnoxious from funny. A couple of them are OK but it gets old fast. He's a one trick pony.Save your money - download a few of the more interesting ones for free and see if you like it. Then re-consider buying the cd. As an example, if you listen to one, would you like to hear it again? No. My point is, unlike Sam Kinison, or any talented comic, this material interesting and a little funny once but it has no staying power. Once you've heard one or two, you've heard them all."
2,Real calls?,"I heard these a coupla times, and, I don't know, but some (not all) sound like they're staged calls. The ""telemarketers"" seem to play along too easily and know just what to say to set up the ""jokes"". Most of the telemarketers I've dealt with don't have a real stake in what they're selling so they would more than likely just hang up rather than keep feeding him the straight lines. Sorry, just a nagging thought I had while hearing some of these. That being said, a few are semi-funny once, but they get old fast."
1,"... , and not funny","I really thought I was getting a great comedy CD when I bought this. I figured it was a great idea and when I looked at the track titles I thought this has to be funny. Well I was wrong. First of all, the sound is horrible. It sounds like it was recorded in a toilet. Second of all, it just isn't funny. I don't know what's worse: his Southern accent or his attempt at comedy. Very disappointing."
2,Funny once,"After you listen to this CD once you'll have little desire to do it again. It is ok, but only a one shot deal."
5,Rockport Quality Wins Again!,"We ordered the Rockport Women's Faisel Oxford, white leather shoes, to accommodate needs for a wider toe (regular running shoes are nice, but characteristically have narrow toes that rub where wide toe areas are involved). We also wanted them in classic white (without the new psychedelic colors). We also wanted good looks, long wear, and overall comfort. We got all three, and elegance thrown in. The shoes are soft, almost kid leather quality and flexibility. They are very light and go with any casual outfit. The price is less than most running or walking shoes, and bear the mark of excellence: Rockport. The soles are built like heavy duty running shoes, with hard rubber cleated surface, and a toe tip wrap-around. For comfort, quality, multi-use, and the feel of real leather, we recommend these shoes, as well as Rockport's regular soft leather oxfords, the sport jacket go-with."
3,Amusing look at 70's skateboard culture.............,"I do not know which ""version"" of Skateboard Madness this is being sold here on Amazon. Through the years, segments have been added to this movie to keep it relevant (snowboarding, punk rock, animated sequences etc.). I am reviewing the original 1980 version in this summary. If you liked Dogtown & Z-Boys, this film should be right up your alley. It features some great pool and pipe skating as well as tons of grainy 16mm footage of the 70's skate ""scene"". There is a thin plot about a photographer that travels around with a group of skaters that outlines many skateboard and some rollerskating segments. It also includes a Claymation animated segment about a rat and a hippie skating around a concrete skate park. If you love striped tube socks, long hair and Vans shoes, this is a movie for you."
1,swag lights,"The lights are not what I expected. They have green wire when I expectedwhite wire. All the rest I have are white. As a result, I never used them. I don't recall the item indicating what the wire color was. I would have returned them except the cost of shipping really didn't make it worth while."
4,good for organizing,I bought these baskets to organize/store stuff in our medicine cabinet with wire shelves. (Stupid wire shelves that almost everything falls through or falls over). They'd be perfect if a little shorter on the sides. But with the holes you can still see a lot of what's in there. And there's room for labels on the black handles.
1,Watch out for Region 2,"It's a shame Amazon allows this DVD to sell in the USA. I never knew of the different regions a DVD would play in, I was just happy this movie was finally out to purchase. It has (Region 2) next to the title, meaning it won't play on any DVD or Blu Ray I have, it is not formatted for the United States. Do not buy!"
1,Regions,If I cannot get Passed Away in the US region why not tell me .instead of letting me go through all the steps to perchase t Just say this DVD is not available for use on DVD's in the USA. When it is not available in the USA region simply state this fact next to the item!And!!!!Why advertize it at all if Americans cannot purxhase a version which plays on American DVD's?
1,Passed Away,"Since this DVD came from London, Eng. I can't even use it.....I'm in America....couldn't someone have told me this would happen? I didn't know there would be a difference in where I got the DVD from. Is it even available in the States?"
3,Very Imformative,I only have time for a quick note. I used this book for a paper I have to write on Designer Drugs. I got a lot of imformation from this book and it was clear and imformative. Perfect for info. gathering. If you need acurate information on Designer drugs this book is for you!
2,Am I missing something?,"I put this CD in the player thinking it would say words in English then translate them to French. Unless I'm missing something, the CD is just a man speaking French. I have no clue what he's saying because, duh, I don't know the French language. Could the book and CD somehow be made to work together rather than separately?"
3,Good for a lush,"Took this to France and forgot the French/English dictionary. Big mistake. This book is great for someone going to France to party and have sex with every male or female they meet, but for everyday use it is lacking many basic phrases. Example: ""Do you have Syphilis?"" is in the book, but ""Where is the nearest gas station?"" is not."
3,Lonely Planet French I think should be called Tiny Planet French,"I purchased this book for a trip to Paris in October, it was so small that I struggled to use it and finally gave up and it rode out the rest of my visit at the bottom of my purse.It is laid out nicely, the sections are easy to find and the interpretations easy to follow (if you can read them).Being of an age now that I require reading glasses this book was a little too little for me."
4,Like it.,This is a good one if you want to get some practical lines down quickly. It fits in a small bag and convenient to go anywhere with it for that matter.
3,A little disappointing,"After falling in love with the characters in These Is My Words, I couldn't wait to read more about them in Sarah's Quilt. Unfortunately, this second book didn't have near the depth of the first. Even though this one is not quite the epic tale as the first book was, and understandably isn't as grand, there just wasn't the same characterization and involvement. I didn't feel as connected to the characters, and they didn't seem to grow and change like they did in ""These...""Also, I'm still left wondering why it's titled, ""Sarah's Quilt."" The quilt was hardly a part of the story. It's as if the author picked the title first, then wrote the book and threw in a few things about the quilt at the end.Although, it did sate my appetite for more about Sarah Prine and her family, overall it was a little disappointing."
5,Very Easy,"I didn't even give it much thought, it was so easy. I ordered the book for a Christmas gift and it got to my house in a very timely manner. I would definetely order more books from this person."
3,good but not as good as the first,I loved the first book but was a little disappointed in this one. It wasnt the same page turner as the first but was still a good book. Sarah was a more multidimensional in the last book.
2,Should have trusted my gut...,"...because every sequel I have ever read has never compared to the original novel. But, after reading all the positive reviews I took the plunge and got this sequel.I absolutely LOVED every word of ""These is My words"" and could not wait to start this sequel. I was greatly let down because I found Sarah's Quilt to be boring, too long, predictable, tiresome and very disappointing. It in no way comes close to ""These is..."".Should have trusted my gut."
4,A Good Sequel to the First,"I read several of the reviews before downloading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed ""These Is My Words,"" and wanted to finish the series. The reviews had me skeptical about reading book 2, but I decided to go ahead, and I'm glad I did. Though the book wasn't as good a story as the first one, I felt myself wanting to know what happens to Sarah and her family. I wanted to tell her that her neighbor is not to be trusted, and to follow her feelings about Lazarus. I wanted to hold her hand and sometimes hug her. I know that most of the complaints is that it wasn't as good a book because Jack wasn't in it, but it proves that life has to go on, even when you might not want to. This book took Sarah through her healing process with the loss of Jack, and showed us her strong spirit we all know well.I gave this a 4 star because it isn't as good as the first, but I think it is worth a read. I look forward to reading the next book in the series."
3,Mixed Review,"As much as I loved ""These is My Words"", Nancy Turner's Book 1 of this trilogy, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed in Sarah's Quilt, Book 2. I realize that during this time in history there was a lot of sadness and struggle to make a life in the Arizona Territories, but I just didn't feel the connection to the characters as I did in Book 1.With regards to the water witch, I thought that was all a little weird. Oh, not that there was one, but just the ending with regards to his character. To me this made his whole character seem unbelievable even though they did exist during that time in history.The third book, The Star Garden is the last book in this trilogy and I will read it, hoping that the style of writing is more like that in Book 1. I loved Sarah's character and I'm excitied to become engaged, once again, in her life story."
3,Good but...,"I so enjoyed ""These is My Words"" and was so happy to find that the story of Sarah continued. The disappointing thing about the sequel was the lack of consistency and some outcomes that lack realism. Nonetheless, the author does a fabulous job making Sarah come to life and I especially could relate to so many of the character's feelings as a mother. I have begun ""The Star Garden"" and am looking forward to what Sarah will face now."
2,Disapointed,"Imagine the Arizona Territories at the end of the 1800's and the settlers who tamed it. Now imagine EVERY possible tragety imaginable, and you have the jist of the book! Come on, now. It becomes a little tireing, unbeleiveable, and ridiculous after a bit. This was a bit disappointing to me because, even though there was plenty of heartache in the first book, it was a great story and you had.... Jack (sigh). In book two the tragic life becomes unreal and there is no...(sigh) Jack. Don't waste your time. I'm not even going to pursue book three."
3,disappointed,"I absolutely loved the first book in this series, so I bought this one. But I was highly disappointed and couldn't get into it. The writing style was completely different. Granted, the character has aged 20 years, so perhaps that is literarily acceptable, but I didn't relate to it as well and missed the character I had grown to love in the first book. It also was less like a diary, lacked voice, and didn't suck me in."
2,Ok this is FUNNY,but personally I'm not looking for humor in my workout.... These girls are just out there. And the moves are goofy!
1,They are bimbos not all American.,Terrible acting. WHat was with the car chases? I didn't like the part with the submarine either. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed!
1,Wrong book for me.,I love aviation and photography yet lack any professional training in either field. I had hoped this book would be at a level I could gain something from--I was wrong.
5,Bill Minor,"I don't read many books, but this book was recomended by so many people, I just had to see what it was about. WOW! This book pulled me in. I felt that I was in the book!"
5,Tolkien-Master of Fantasy,"Wonderful, one of the greastest books of all time. Tolkien creates a completely new world, full of interesting stories and events. Middle Earth has a deep history, making it interests. The Lord of the Rings, being one of the best fantasies ever written, it is interesting and full of action. It makes you use your imagination to picture Tolkien's world. It has something for everyone. Most definately one of the greatest books ever written."
5,Very Good,This is great for a gift and useful too.Light is bright enough and has a great feel.Cons: casing looks like a cheap plastic. But I can live with that.
2,"Well constructed... weak, weak beam.","The construction of this mini-flashlight is very solid... however the beam produced is exceedingly weak, and the on/off mechanism is a rotary switch. So, take your pick... good construction, good price, bad design with a conventional mini-bulb (no LED). Altogether, a good last-resort clipper for the wallet chain or breast pocket."
2,No LED bulb,I like everything about this light EXCEPT the bulb! Come on MAG get with the program and start putting LED bulbs in all your flashlights. These lights are too well made to put such a dim old-fashioned bulb inside.
2,Watch out! You are only paying for the brand..,"I bought one of these, thinking to include it into a small emergency kit.. When I finally received, got really disappointed. If you're even intending to get as a key ring for finding the key hole on the door, better go for a cheap chinese flashlight.. It will be without doubt brighter than this one!!! The light of my cellphone goes brighter!!!! ..Still, this one looks pretty.. Useless.. But pretty!"
1,Do not buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am an accounting student at the Univ. of Sask. I had to buy this text for my Mangagement Accounting class. This book is incomplete when they are doing examples. The writers don't explain where they got their numbers from. It's very difficult trying to learn it. Also, the exercise problems at the end are horrible!! They are so vague!!!"
1,I expected a lot more out of Robert Kaplan,I found the text to be poorly proofread. Some of the examples in the text did not tie to the information given. I found the examples hard to follow and the explanations vague. I expected a lot more from Mr. Kaplan.
2,This book is not what I expected....,"I have studied, practiced and taught managerial accounting for more than 17 years at work, using excellent supporting text and case books from recognized US authors. But to be honest Dr. Kaplan is making easy concepts to appear complicated and cumbersome. His case readings as well as the text materials are very length and hard to ""digest"" since it does not capture the attention of the reader.I would not recommend the book neither for and undergraduate or graduate degree, despite the well known and worldwide recognition of Dr. Kaplan. His book is far from being pedagogical in nature."
1,An Advanced Accounting Student Opinion,"I have studied many aspects of financial and management accounting, management issues, etc. from introductory to advanced levels. I have never used such an unappealing book. The student must sift through much wordiness. There are few, and sometimes no examples of the various calculations. There is very little use of white space. Virtually no colour, no use of bullets. Not only is the material presented in a ""dry"" form, but the book is not pretty to look at. The most praise I can give this book is that it is not too heavy to carry, and it has a pretty blue cover."
1,The Worst Accounting Book I have Ever Read,"I'm an accounting lecturer.This book is very, very poor. Even if you already know what Kaplan is trying to explain, it is almost impossible to follow his incoherent ramblings.A textbook to avoid at all costs."
1,hmphh....,"The explanation is too long, examples are vague, ambiguous and the cases provided is not really relevant to my level of knowledge. This book might be best for PhD holders, but not for me who is an undergraduate. My lecturer also complained that the explanation used is not suitable for our level. No interesting graphics or colour to attract readers."
2,"Into the deep, drowned in the cases","This student textbook assumes a basic of management accounting. Well, I was known with the terms, and understood their examples, but completely lost track at the cases. At first I thought it was due to my language knowledge, but colleague students had the same problems and couldnot explain to me which information to use, which parts of the cases was useful and what was rubbish. Of course 'management accounting' is about retrieving the correct information, but it was a few steps to early for me."
2,Things looked good at first then...,"I read a lot of reviews that seemed to be mixed on the performance of this laser mouse, but decided to take a chance. When I first installed it, things worked great, but after the first time a re-charged it, I could no longer see the cursor in certain applications (i.e. MS Outlook, some games, etc). I had not experienced this problem with the mouse during the first week of use. Not seeing the cursor makes some applications not usable or extremely difficult to use. I sent a note to Logitech and got back a canned response after a week telling me to make sure the device was located away for other electronic devices, etc.In fairness to Logitech, I am running ME as opposed to XP, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1."
1,Be careful of this,"If you need to set your double-click rate to something faster or slower than the default setting, you CANNOT do this after installing Logitech's drivers. Quote from their tech support:> Thank you for your recent inquiry about your Pointing Devices.>> I understand that you are unable to customize the double-click rate on your Logitech 510 optical mouse.>> Please refer the following steps to resolve the issue:>> 1. Uninstall the MouseWare software from Start | Control Panel |> Add/Remove programs.> 2. Adjust the settings with the native drivers.> 3. If you are able to adjust the settings on native drivers please> perform a clean boot of MouseWare software."
1,Made for a large hand,"This laser mouse works very well. The mouse is too large and too heavy. It is definitely made for a man. So mine is being returned! Another item of interest, the base has to sit 8"" away from anything electrical and metal."
1,Got a Lemon ...,"Let me first state that I'm an avid gamer and the mouse got some heavy use. Once the mouse started charging properly the battery had excellent life and would last for days. Overall feel and shape is the same as any other typical mouse out there.Initially I had problems charging this mouse. It would charge sometimes and not others. Eventually took some abrasive paper to the contacts and solved that problem.Buttons started acting up after 4 months, occasionally sticking. By the time 6 months rolled around I was ready to toss this as far as I could throw it. I constantly had buttons locking up and have recently resorted to slamming the mouse on the desktop repeatedly to return function to it. I expected more from the device that initially cost $70 ..."
1,Extremely Jumpy,"The mouse has a tendency to jump the cursor around the screen when moving. It's somewhat random but the jumps can be very severe. For example, you could be moving in a small area at the center of the screen and suddenly find the cursor at the very bottom of the screen. I've tried both a 3M mousing surface and a regular black cloth mouse pad and the issue was prevalent on both. I thought it would be nice to have the advertised level of precision but the jumps defeat the purpose.Update - Tried the latest logitech software, been on the phone with their tech support, and the conclusion is for me to send the mouse back to Amazon. Since many others are having favorable results, I'm going to try exchanging it for another MX1000 and hope for the best."
5,old mouse that beats all the new mouses,"just perfect mouse for dekstop pc, especialy for men(that have usualy bigger hands)logitech gret company with the best mouses in the world, keep doind similar mouse like this.great product with great value."
5,Speedy Mouse,This is an excellent product--the best mouse I've ever had. It holds a charge for days on end and is super fast in responding.
5,The best mouse ever?,"If it isn't, it's the best mouse I've ever owned.I work in the ""industry"" so I suppose I've come in contact with quite a few mice. As such, I've come to value certain qualities in a good mouse... this one has them all.Pros:- Good solid feel (weight, grip, etc).- Plenty o' buttons- Laser tracking... it's smooth and nice.- FANTASTIC battery life. I need to recharge it maybe once a month, if that and I'm on my computer a LOT.Cons:-Price perhaps? Or response time... it might not be the perfect mouse for a hardcore fps gamer, but even for a mild fpser it'd be fine.Just make sure to get yourself a good mousepad too!"
4,cool,"this mouse is of course very good (its a logitech, of course its good). but it isn't flawlesspros--the first laser mouse in the world meaning that it is very precise-many usefull functions (back, forward, scroll left, right, up, down, and application switch)-comfortable-lasts for a very long time before u need to charge it (around 1 month of constant use for it to get it 66.6% full)cons--for some reason, its hard to push the middle button without pushing the scroll left/right button.-forward/back functions don't work on mozilla firefox browsers-a little big for childrenbut overall, its a great mouse, its durable, long battery life, and it made a record (first laser mouse in the world). i highly recommend this product for home users, gamers, and office users."
3,Not satisfied,"I'm a long time Logitech fan, having had many of their products which I've found superior. My previous mouse was a MX500. The problem with the MX1000 was a jittery cursor. The thing was not stable, it jumped around all the time, not by a lot but enough that I had to concentrate on positioning it in a box or whatever. Just not nearly as stable as the MX500. Finally decided to change to a MS Explorer 2.0 Wireless IntelliMouse (on sale) which I like much better. Hate to admit this as I'm one to avoid MS if I can.On the plus side the battery was excellent, lasting a long time before needing recharge."
4,Laser mouse a relief,"I previously had another wireless mouse and it seemed to eat up AA batteries and the charger didn't work well. The main reason I bought this mouse was the fact I didn't need to change the battery. I was dissapointed for two reasons; The first was the mouse is not completely compatible with my KVM switch. The second the mouse configuration software would not always allow me to configure the mouse when after losing the config settings when switching computers. The extra features are OK, but I don't use them. I just wanted to be able to use the scroll functions and not change batteries all the time. This mouse satisfied those requirements."
5,Awesome Mouse,"I was looking for a new mouse because I had the cordless duo and was looking for an upgrade. I stumbled across this mouse and it's amazing. I have had no problems at all with it. 100% accurate, it is a night and day difference from my old mouse. If you are thinking about getting this mouse, then I am telling you to think no more, buy it now, you will not regret it. I have it running perfectly on Windows XP SP2, P4, and 1 Gig of ram. I use Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Flash, Visual Studio.NET 2003 a ton usually about 9+ hours a day, so I am constantly using a mouse and I highly recommend it."
4,Not a significant performance increase over optical,"Mouse works well as I would expect from logitech, who has never disappointed me with any of thier products. It has a great feel, holds it's charge and was simple to install. I have 2 negative things to say. The first is that I have not seen much of an improvement over the optical mouse I was using with my Logitech MX700 desktop. The second is that the scroll wheel feels a little flimsy compared to the old one. The best improvement over the older designs is the left/right scroll wheel. Overall I would recommend it."
4,"nice mouse, not perfect","This is the best mouse I have used. Only problem has been that it won't work on one of those calander type deskpads. The high contrast black and white lines messed it up. Since I use the mouse on my desk, I had to throw the deskpad and just use it on the desk. Works perfect on that surface, and most others."
5,"There's no going back to other mice, now!","I purchased my Logitech MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse about five or six months ago, and I'm hooked. I'm a computer geek -- programmer (web developer), digital photography pro and habitual Internet surfer. I spend countless hours at my computer, and I quickly discover what input devices work for me and which don't. The MX1000 works for me. Its smooth tracking, ergonomic feel and controls, superb battery life and convenient battery status lights and yes, it's coolness (geek) factor due to using a laser, make it the only mouse I use on my desktop computer now.I will note, however, that the first MX1000 mouse I purchased I had to return for replacement due to a loose left mouse button that provided inadequate resistance and caused accidental clicks. My replacement MX1000 has worked without fail since I received it 6 months ago. I use it daily, for hours at a time. No complaints!"
2,"A great mouse, except for the rechargeable battery","I owned one of these for several years, and loved it. I'd still be using it today if the rechargeable battery hadn't died on me. It's not user-replaceable, so when it dies you can throw away the mouse. If they had made this mouse to use AA batteries I would have given it 5 stars. Shame on Logitech for making a mouse that won't allow you to replace the battery."
2,Don't Buy This Mouse!,The battery burns out way fast and it's annoying. I've actually had to sit and not to work while it 'charged' who needs that??Plus I would deal with that ok if it was super specific. It's not. It's skippy. Laser my [...]. This mouse is a [...]. [...].
1,DEAD AFTER 3 WEEKS. NO RESPONSE FROM LOGITECH,I have had to plug in my old mouse.I tried restarting and resetting the Logitech Laser mouse a dozen times.I submitted a report to Logitech about 10 days ago.I included all the model and serial numbers.I have not received any response at all.What a waste of $66.
1,MX1000 BrickHouse,"I bought this mouse 6 months ago and Boy, was I happy. It had EVERYTHING and more than I could possibly have wanted in a mouse.The trouble, though, is that the one thing I do NOT want in a mouse is too evident in this mouse. Whilst new it glides like a dream but after a few weeks it's poly feet begin to scratch.The mouse ScrApeS AloNg your mouse pad like a brick wrapped in sandpaper after only a few weeks and THAT is annoying. I simply can't use the mouse anymore and had to go back to my old mouse."
1,Poor Design,"It doesn't matter how good the mouse is,if you can't CHARGE it.Others have said it's won't sit properly in the charging cradle and they were correct.Unless you hold your breath,stand on one foot and touch your nose with one finger,IT'S NOT GONNA CHARGE.Poor design ,Logitec.Maybe yours will,maybe it won't.Want to take a chance on it?Oh,and Lefties,forget about it.This is a VERY right handed mouse.You won't even be remotely able to adapt to it.2 thumbs down."
2,"Very responsive mouse, but...","I had to replace my first MX1000 because a full battery charge lasted less than five days instead of the 21 days claimed by Logitech. The replacement MX1000 is behaving the same way. On the fourth day, the green LED charge indicator was already down to a single light (out of three). This mouse is destined to be returned as well."
2,Fails when starting from a cd,Overall the mouse works as well as the optical Logitech I was using. However I found a huge flaw in the way the MX 1000 works. The mouse does not work at all when you need to start from a cd (such as Disk Warrior) or when you use the option key at startup (on a Mac) to choose what disk to start from. In order to do anything in these cases you need to connect a different mouse. This is entirely unacceptable to me and I am returning the MX 1000. I contacted Logitech support and they tell me that is not a feature of the mouse. They also sounded rather unsure of what they sell. To have software that will not support the mouse use at these times is completely unacceptable.
5,Logitech MX1000 Laser,"Excellent product! Now that I have a wireless mouse, I'm not too sure how and why I lived with a mouse bound to a box!The Logitech is extremely precise in movement. I bought this one for work... I'm going to buy another for home."
4,Mouse Not just for Gamers.,"The MX1000 is a great product. I would have given it five stars,but the install docs where poor. I had to find information at Logitech's support site to get this rodent working. This mouse is larger and lighter than the MX700, and tracks smoothly around a mouse pad. You can move it with a finger. Now if Logitech made a wireless rechargeable keyboard."
3,MX1000 movement,"After hooking up this mouse, it was constantly jumping to the top and left side of the screen by itself. Even after the patch installation when I was scrolling across my desk, it would stop moving for a few inchs. I then hooked up my Locitech 700 cordless optical mouse and it works perfectly. I also like the way the optical 700 wires go up to the charger- receiver. There is only one vs two on the laser mouse. I really dont see much advantage to the laser myself."
1,Wait until Logitech gets their act together,"Search the internet for ""MX1000 problem"" before you buy. Many units are not level and wobble when on a flat surface. Many users report issues with lag. The Setpoint driver software has issues. I've contacted Logitech and they expect me to pay for a toll call to get an RMA number, pay for shipping, and then wait 6+ weeks to receive a unit without the wobble. Do yourself a big favor and wait this one out. There's no excuse for Logitech letting this slip through quality control and then expecting the customers to bear the expense. On the plus side, the mouse is very comfortable."
4,Only a few minor flaws,"I have two of these--one for home, one for work. The MX1000 is smooth and very functional, and feels good in your hand. The buttons are fairly intuitive and put other, non-Logitech mice to shame. Just two quibbles:1. The tilt scroll (scrolling from left to right by tilting the wheel) is pretty much useless, and appears not to work with a lot of programs.2. The charger base for my home mouse is kind of screwy--sometimes, in order to get it to charge, I have to wet the contacts and wiggle the mouse around in the base (it will charge just fine in my work charger).UPDATE: Well, it's been a while, but now BOTH of my mice give me a hard time about charging on the charger. VERY frustrating.Haven't tried the MX Revolution yet, but apart from that this is THE mouse to have."
3,Logitech MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse Review,"Pros:-It has a nice comfortable feel.-Scroll & Thumb buttons work nice. (in certain apps)-The laser seems to be very accurate.-Love the cordless.Cons:-Don't like having to plug into both power & USB for the cradle.-The wheel is very clunky, not smooth at all.-In some applications I have to switch to a MS driver to get the wheel to function like a normal mouse, but then I loose the buttons.Overall it is a good product. With a couple changes it would be great."
2,A driver bug makes it unusable with a KVM switch,"Switching between computers will cause the mouse wheel and extra buttons to fail until the computer is put into suspend mode and resumed. This is caused by a (probably simple) bug in the mouse driver, but rather than fix the problem Logitech just says they don't support KVM switches. Switching to a standard ps/2 mouse driver takes care of the wheel problem, but you won't have use of the extra buttons or side scroll. My impression is that Logitech is too big to care about their customers."
3,"Doesn't last, was nice while it did",I use this a lot for graphic design and web searching and it worked fine until a glitch developed in the left mouse button micro-switch. Does not appear serviceable and I thought it should have lasted more than a year or so.
1,uncommonly bad,"This mouse looks nice and comes with a resume packed full of features. The big problem is, it works poorly. Very poorly. I have a black desktop, where the mouse works not at all; just wave it around and the pointer remains wherever it was when you started. I therefore use this mouse on some sort of substrate, typically a blank sheet of paper. It works better under these conditions, but still very poorly. The pointer wanders around and I have to labor carefully to bring it to my intended mark. Often it overshoots the target. It's not that I move the mouse past the target, I move to the target, then the pointer continues to drift away slowly, not responding to my movements of the actual mouse. So, I'd keep looking. The idea of this mouse is promising, but the reality is sorely disappointing."
2,"Worked Fine, Odd Shape and Weight","I disliked this mouse. It worked fine and connected with the iMac easily. But it's an oddly-shaped mouse, and very heavy. Beginning to use it, I enjoyed the absence of a wire. But by the end of only an hour, my wrist and forearm were aching -- and my wrist and forearm never ache. I put the mouse back in its box and returned it pronto."
5,Works as good as expected,"The first one that shipped wouldn't charge at all, but Amazon had no problem exchanging it for another one and taking care of the shipping charges. The second one works perfect and is very precise with the movement. I purchased this for my wife since I have a Logitec MX 700 mouse already and I didn't want to get her the same one and have us interfering with each other since our 2 computers are in the same office/room in the house. Also couldn't beat the rebate since no store could match the price. Well worth the money."
5,Easy to use... What a wonderful laser mouse!,"I have had this mouse for about a month now. I bought it so that I can use it at work. It's a pleasure to use since I hated the cheap mouse I had have at work. It's very comfortable to use, especially for people with long fingers. I love the fast scroller button. I bought this from Amazon because the computer stores cost about $30 more. It was definitely worth the money. I'm almost tempted to buy one for my home laptop but I wouldn't want to travel with a large mouse. I have to try and find a laser logitech for my notebook now. :-)"
4,Second Times' the Charm,Having used this models' predecessor (MX700) for a few years it had to be replaced by nothing but the MX1000. The device is as close to ideal as a mouse can be for me. Surfing or my first game playing efforts are really enhanced by this device. The only reason it doesn't recieve five stars is the first one had to be returned for replacement. Amazon is very good to deal with if there is a problem so don't hesitate to try this mouse out for yourself.
5,Fantastic,"I just returned the Microsoft 6000 wireless keyboard and mouse after using them for a few very painful weeks. I have replaced them with the Logitech MX1000 and a wired Microsoft keyboard (I really just don't need to be untethered when using my keyboard; it's not like I can see those tiny little letters on my monitor from 10 feet away anyhow).The MX1000 is absolutely great, and the performance gap versus the Microsoft laser mouse is huge. The Logitech feels better, looks better, and works far better than its Microsoft rival. Plus it's rechargable. You'll spend a few bucks more, but it's so worth it."
1,Major waste of money (and time),"For the life of me can not get the mousewheel to work..Tried everything I could think of plus a few from the logitech fourms.This purchas is a complete waste of money. If you are thinking of buying, Justy remember what Mrs Reagan used to say ""Just say NO"". spend your money on a different brand.The added weight of this mouse will come in handy when you throw it towards a dumpster."
3,easy to disconnect,"i am a huge logitech fan, i had mx500, mx700, rumblepad 2 etc, but this guy mx1000, really annoyed me, it always disconnected, wobble to top of screen, if you are a game player, your gun point to sky when enemy move to you, what do you feel?very bad connection."
1,mx1000 problems,i have a couple of problems with the mx1000. I have problems with the software. The side scrolls dont work on certain browsers like firefox also the back and front buttons dont work. i aslo have the problem with lifting it up. It freezes when u lift it up a slight bit so for gamers this is probably not the best and it is very sensitive.
4,"nice, not for a laptop though","I was hoping it was a re-chargeable, wireless laser mouse, but you have to plug the base into pc making it not very portable. Very fast and reactive though. And works well on virtually any surface."
3,Decent mouse,"This is a great mouse half the time, and worthless the other half. When it works it is the most accurate mouse I have ever used. It is beautiful for gaming or just surfing the web. Then, it just starts spazing out, moving sporadically, and clicking on random stuff. At first I thought the unit I had was defective, so I took it back to the store to get a different one. That one had the exact same problem. I suggest you don't buy this product until they fix this problem."
1,Rushed to Production,"Numerous problems plague this mouse. Lift it from your surface and try to mouse again and experience delays. Buttons do not work in most applications, and are not recognized in almost any games. They are also trying to replace their ""MouseWare"" drivers with a new 'SetPoint' software, with a tremendous reduction in features (less than 1/2 the button assignment options) and an incredible bloat (~17MB instead of 2-3MB).I would advise: stay away for the next month or three, while they work the problems out of this one. Anyone posting to the contrary is probably not trying to make full use of their mouse, or otherwise is posting as an agent of Logitech...If you want more info for YOURSELF, go check logitech's User Support forums at http://forums.logitech.com ... See what people are saying. For every ""I Love It"" comment there are at least 6+ ""Doesnt work anywhere"" comments ..."
2,Needs better drivers,"I was initially excited about this mouse, and it does work well over ANY surface.However, it did not work with my existing wireless keyboard from Microsoft. My system would lock up after about 20 minutes. When I removed the mouse driver, it would work fine for about 2 hours before it locked up.Even when I switched to a non wireless keyboard, the mouse would still lock up the system. It didn't matter whether I used the driver or not.I scoured the message boards looking for an answer to my problem, and I noticed a lot of other users having different problems also. It seems that Logitech developed a good product, but didn't spend time to make sure that the driver was compatible with XP and other hardware/software."
2,"Another hardware failure, just after 6 months","Hey, the mouse felt and performed great, just after few adjustments through the logitech software. During the first 3 months, it was flawless, then signal inturreptions and action button freezing started to occur, I'd say occasionally. Suddenly and after around 5 and 1/2 months of use, the mouse started to act crazy, hanging and freezing windows applications. It caused me losing some of my documents. As I'm now in the middle of finishing my PhD thesis, I wouldn't risk using it with my work.Honestly, I was always a logitech user, but not any more, after investing in such unreliable product, which can cost more than the $50 paid for it.My advise, if extreme accuracy is not a requirements for you, go for an older, more reliable and stable mouse. As I said, if you depend on this one, it might cost you dearly."
2,"Great mouse, Bad reciever","This mouse is great, has excellent dynamics and all. However, the downside of it, that after I bought it, I found out that it doesn't have a little portable signal receiver. Instead, the signal receiver is the same as the charging base. Which makes taking the mouse and the laptop around very hard. Its a great mouse, yet its not that much of a milestone from previous Logitech mouses."
2,Beware of Ergonomics,"I only give it two stars because the laser tracking is magnificent! But the ergonomics of the mouse and the button placement make it un-usable. I tried this out for close to a week and was not satisfied. It left my hand cramped from even 15 minutes of use. It is too large in all directions and is very heavy, which required too much force to move the mouse. It would have been nice if the finger cutouts would be a little deepr for the pinkey finger and its counterpart and that the thumb print be shallower. The back and forward buttons strain your thumb to push becasue they are so akwardly places. The only thing to praise besides the laser is the scroll wheel. If they made a slimer version of this mouse, I would buy it. But until then, the mouse hunt continues."
4,Great Mouser,"Bought this mouse last week when my other mouse died. The response on this mouse is somewhat slow to pick up when you begin moving, so you travel more than the mouse actually moves. Outside of that, the radio works fine (I think that is where the slow to initally move comes from), and the laser is much more reliable. My last mouse was MS's optical mouse. I couldn't use it on my table top because there wasn't much in the way of a pattern or anything. I always had to use a pad or something. But this little mouse works on surfaces where the optical wouldn't! This truly is a terrific mouse!"
2,not much difference...,"I am currently using Microsoft mouse and it is much lighter and comfortable. I like the laser, but I really cannot tell the difference between a laser and an optical tracking... My optical mouse performs just fine, but I bought this just to see how much the tracking will improve... again, not much. This mouse is too big and heavy for me. Like one of the other reviewer said, the grip is really funky! I use my mouse for 5-6hrs a day and this thing is way too heavy!!! it hurts my wrist after about 30min use!!! I was going to give it to my wife, but she cannot use it because of its weight and it is designed only for right handed users... she's left handed... I"
2,Nice item. Poor pricing.,"Can you say ""Rip Off?"" Just because Logitech made an optical mouse cordless doesn't mean it has the right to jack the price up almost 3.5 times more then the usual. Plus the Charging it must take should decrease the value some. You're better off just paying the $14 for that blue & silver optical mouse with block scroller and window switching butten below mouse buttons. Logitech is just a bunch of rip-offs."
5,Superb!,"Logitech has been in the mouse business for quite a few years now and they just get better and better. This mouse is a fine example of quality engineering leaving little to be desired. Comfortable ergonomics, laser tracking speed equalling a USB-connected mouse, all the buttons you could ever want, an on/off switch, fast recharging, and even a well-placed battery meter. This mouse looks, feels, and performs like a high quality piece of gear. Well worth the price!5 stars!!!**Update**The battery life on this mouse is unreal! I'm at 3 weeks right now off of a single charge and I still have 2 bars. Amazing!"
2,BEWARE: NO BLUETOOTH,This is definitly not the mouse you want if you intend to use it with a laptop because you'll have to carry the clunky base station with you AT ALL TIMES. I had thought the mouse would be bluetooth but I found out the hard way that it is not. It is a great mouse for its brief period of usage but those of us with bluetooth ... at least me anyway ... don't want all the extra assessories.First no on/off switch for the 900mx.Now the newer mouse doesn't have bluetooth.Call me critical but I am extremely dissappointed with Logitech's shortcomings and now they're no longer my favorite mouse company.
5,Very Well-Made Mouse,"What would you get if you crossed the Energizer Bunny with a tank and turned it into a computer pointing device? This mouse, of course! Seriously, they must have fed the lithium ion battery in this thing manna before enclosing it in the rock solid construction that is the MX1000. Even after 6 & 1/2 years a full charge can last up to 4 days or longer with moderate use. The mouse is contoured to fit a medium-sized hand very well and the signal/tracking is on par with the very best wired mice I have used.Although not as comfortable in the hand or full-featured as the MX Revolution (the MX1000 is a heavy mouse), the reliability and durability of this device puts it in a class of its own. Even though they no longer make this model, it is definitely worth tracking down a used one if these are the characteristics you are looking for."
5,Get it Mannn!,"WOW..... Truly a god send for computer lovers. I was one of those, ahhh it doesn't matter all mouses are the same person until i bumped heads with this baby. I can't put it down, it's just to fun... never knew it would be so precise towards my movements... stop those long tedious late night hours researching and comparing mouses! Get this one you won't regret it! I got mines at logicalplus.com for $100.00 including the mx 3000 keyboard =(Logitech MX 3100)"
1,Top Of The Line?,"I purchased this mouse with high expectations: at $80.00+ it had to be good right?!?. Unfortunately, it came loaded with problems. Here are a few: poorly placed buttons that required completely reorienting your hand to use, poor software GUI, incompatibility with other Logitech receivers, LESS button programmability than with older products (no minimize all feature?!?! Come on!!!) and the kicker, random cusor jumping. On the plus side, it did come pre-charged and the on-off button appears to work.To be fair; it may not perform very well, but at least it's expenive."
2,Charger & Software are poor,"Generally a good project except the mouse had to be placed in the charger just right or it would not charge. Also, as with all Logitech products, the software is awful if you have installed more than one Logitech product. For some odd reason once you have installed Logitech software, all attempts to delete it or to install another Logitech product requires a full Windows reinstall."
2,Logitech MX1000 Cordless Mouse,"The Laser Mouse performed fairly well. However, I normally never turn my computer off, but just put it in a ""sleep"" mode. About 10% of the time, when I ""woke up"" the computer the curser would lock up and not respond to the mouse. I would have to reboot my cpmputer and the mouse worked OK for a while, then it would lock up again. I contacted Logitech technicians on two occasions, but the problem was not resolved. I'm now using my old mouse with no problem."
5,Like new!,My wife needed this to replace one that was used up. This came packaged well and in like new shape.
4,Lonnie Donegon Years Later,Brings back many pleasant memories of my early life in England. This is an excellent set and has nearly every one of his great songs - it makes this a great choice.
1,very disappointed,"i'm warning everyone, keep your money. it takes too much time to get a shave that isn't close enough. ideally a product should make things easier and better.signed, still using a razor, and out $50.panasonic, go back to the drawing table."
1,No more Panasonic for me,"This is the third Panasonic eletric razor I've owned. The 1st one broke when I put it in my checked luggage on a 2 hr flight. It got a little shook up I suppose and no longer would charge. The second one I had worked for about a month, and after being charged twice, would no longer hold a charge. The third one I bought just died yesterday. Had it about 3 months, charged it for the second time, and it's no longer holding a charge. I've owned other brands of razors and never had a problem with them holding charges, so I've wasted enough money on these Panasonics."
2,Bad battery charger,"I owned this Panasonic shaver for one and half year. Since I'm very blessed to not have as much hair in my legs, I've been very seldom using this shaver. Nevertheless, I've always annoyed with its charger because it takes more than 8-hours of charging. Finally, after one and half year, this shaver has to retired. I don't really know what went wrong with it, but then it won't hold any charge anymore. I only took it on a trip once and it hasn't been charging properly ever since."
5,Cedar and the others,"Hai there,So happy with this record. I was looking around for Cedar's track 'Golden' and here i found it.But also Strong Nature from Meeting Minds is a favorite one ! Not to forget Jupiter in Taurus from Artemis and so on. Does any one know if Cedar (the lounge band, no not the rock band !) did make albums in the past ? I only can find seperated tracks on collector albums like Cookin'. I am quit curious about that !Regards Wouter"
4,Strong album from Good Looking Records,"I've been to a few places in Chicago where this music would have fit right in with the laid back, groove-appreciating attitude of the crowd. A kind of modern and progressive jazz feel permeates throughout the tracks. A jazz album this is not in the traditional sense. I hear Funk, Jazz, a little Soul, a little R&B. This album is definitely worth actually listening to. It is relaxing yet upbeat. If you are familiar with LTJ Bukem's Journey Inwards, this compliments its style well. Both are off the same label. Expect to hear vocal samples and sound bytes, some solid beats, a few traditional jazz instruments, and synthesized sounds mixed together on these tracks. I would not rate it as an outstanding CD, but it is definitely worth listening to and will not leave you feeling untouched by the music, as I find myself occasionally playing these tracks through in my mind."
2,color not as vibrant,"This rug took awhile to receive, however I tried to remain positive. When I opened the rug, the colors weren't nearly as vibrant as the picture. Not sure it's worth $189. You can probably find one at a local department store for cheaper. Rug looks like it needs cleaning and it's brand new :/ not too happy."
3,"ok, but the writing is atrocious","This book is ok, and it does exactly what it claims: provides an introduction to Gnostic thought, briefly contextualizing major figures and movements.Criticisms: Holroyd's sweeping generalizations of Blake and Jung shouldn't be taken seriously, and the citations are a disaster, both in style and content (even an introductory book could have tried to cite primary texts instead of other secondary works). Nevertheless, I'd have given the book a somewhat higher mark if the writing weren't simply atrocious - never before have I stumbled through horrible style to the extent that my understanding of some passages suffered! It makes me intensely disinterested in the poetry the author has purportedly written as per the author notes. There must be better - certainly better written - introductions out there."
4,electric vomit,"I just bought this cd yesterday and, when I heard the opening notes of the song. I was like...umm I like this band! Blake has a good sense of melody and songwriting. I had not heard this band previous to buying this cd. Except the little song clips on Amazon.com. If those little song clips can impress me then you know this bands gotta be great."
2,Cute for a few hours.....,"I really love this because it looks pretty in the light with the ""pearlized"" style...however....after eating and brushing your teeth the pearl like stuff comes off and its just clear. The same goes for the colored ones like this...I put the red one in this morning and now its just plain red with no different color....kinda sucks"
3,What's in a name?,"I bought this game used. I got all the main parts and so there was no problem there. The main problem was the difficulty in describing some of these names to your partner. Names range from very easy to very obscure. Names from all walks of life are in here. Historical, political, literature, TV and movies, sports, and more. If you're good at remembering names and are a well rounded person with a wide range of knowledge, you'll do well in this game. If not, well . . .The game is designed so that in each round, you get partnered with a different person, and you alternate giving and receiving clues. You have 60 seconds and there are 10 names on each card. This game plays basically like the ""Pyramid"" TV show. Only all the answers are famous names."
5,Hasn't left my player yet!,"I have to admit, I was a little nervous perchasing this CD because of the mixed reviews I have read here and other places. I was very happily surprised. This CD maintains all the original integrity and depth of her previous CD's.The Other Side of Something earns 5 stars from me. The lyrics are bold and honest, the music is very catchy yet genuine. It is rare that I find a CD that I instantly like, but this is one of them. This CD is absolutely worth a listen."
3,"Not my favorite, but not bad","I LOVE Sara Groves music!! God has drawn me close to Himself SO many times through her lyrics. He has brought me to tears and revealed sin in my life through her music. God is good, and He has blessed Sara Groves.This is definitely my least favorite of the 3 cds. It's not BAD, definitely better then most of the Christian Pop out there. *grin* But... it just feels like it's lacking something. I haven't heard a song that has moved me, and I have owned the CD for months. I like a lot of the songs as fun songs to sing, but there just seemed to be some of the usual honesty and clarity missing. I will buy the next Sara CD that comes out because I DO love her music and ministry, but I kind of felt like this latest one was...trying to appeal to the general populus rather then be honest.Maybe Ms. Groves LIKES this new style and then I'd say GO HER! :) The lyrics more then anything else seemed watered down to me though."
1,Not worth the money or time....,"Let's start this off with...I went to college with Sara. I heard many of the songs off of ""Conversations"" and ""Past The Wishing"" back then when they were originally written. I used to love to go to chapel when Sara was singing. Her songs related to every person in the building. Her songs were seeping with honesty and sincerity. She is a great person and deserves all of the success that she has had.However, this cd just doesn't cut it. Where did the old Sara go? I miss the transparent lyrics and heart that was put into the other cds. I agree with some of the previous reviewers that said that it is too pop (maybe Charlie Peacock's influence). I'm not sure that I would compare it to Amy Grant's ""Heart in Motion"" though.I guess I am disappointed and hope that Sara goes back to the style that made her a success."
4,"A well-acted, thoughtful film that needs a wider audience.","I am glad to see this movie on video so that more people may get a chance to see it. Both Glenn Close and Judy Davis were terrific and it dealt with a controversial subject in a mature and open manner. No flash here, just a solid, interesting, enlightening movie."
5,Movie Review Of Serving in Silence,Glenn Close & Judy Davis both were superior in this movie. I especially liked the ending where they kiss - very touching & beautiful!
3,"Sappy, But Good","Peter Strauss, normally a wonderful actor, let's his drama-queen persona move to the forefront as he cries to the dying whale to hold on and not give in. You almost wish he'd marry it and get it over with.Over-acting aside, the movie is based on a superb book (of the same title) and STILL is a fine family movie (violent stupidity notwithstanding). I will give it 3 thumbs up."
1,this is heavy metal ????? no way jose!,"Working in music retail for 15+ yrs and having a cd collection in the thousands I'd think I'd know what music, especially heavy metal, sounds like.Are you kidding me??? Iron Maiden, Dream theater, Faith No more comparisons ..... to what ? This cd isn't even heavy metal much less worthy of the tag progressive metal and to be lumped in with those praiseworthy bands mentioned before. This cd is nothing more then basement Collective Soul meets Poi Dog Pondering. From the provided description I was thoroughly ashamed that someone would even dare think this is heavy metal. This is fluffy pop at best but just a tad better than what you hear on the radio. Avoid if you are a heavy metal fan - at all costs! If you like Poi Dog pondering type of pop then check these guys out."
4,Great lyrics........,"Benjie Hughes' lyrics show emotional maturity and youthful energy; the tunes are creative but not so wildly creative that you can't remember them to hum along, and the performance is solid. The bonus track ought to get some air somewhere......it's beautiful. Cut another album, please."
4,"Masterful, thoughtful lyrical discourse","I listened to this CD borrowed from my brother Mike and I really like the track ""September."" It is a very thoughtfully written track beautiful piano / keyboards.It is excellent to hear another finely performed rendition of one of my favorite late 80's bands ""In Living Colour."" The track ""Cult of Personality"" is original song legend in my mind.I highly recommend this CD."
5,Another brilliant piece by Deep Purple,"I once owned the vinyl in 1973 while I was stationed in Minot N.D. but it was stolen. I never thought of it again until I rediscovered the group in recent years. I found and bought the DVD but it was edited not to my satisfaction. I have finally found a CD of this brilliant performance. I like everything about the composition,and I just wish I could've been there in person.I have found that I enjoy it more as I've gotten older. Yes, Deep Purple was much more than ""Smoke on the Water"""
5,A classic album,"It was in September 1969 when Deep Purple gave their famous concert with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The chemistry between the musicians and the orchestra is phantastic and Malcom Arnold has done his best work since his soundtrack for ""The Bridge on the River Kwai""."
3,Fair try,Jon was trying to make a blend of classical and rock and was reasonably successful. Mr. Blackmore got a bit too free a play with the guitar; otherwise in balance. Recommended as easy listening.
3,It was fashionable,"at the time to experiment with classical music. ELP, Egg, Yes all made attempts to variations of the classics, ELP being the worst abuser. Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra was the most honest effort of them all (albeit futile too). Not exactly a masterpiece, it's quite an interesting experiment of combining rock and symphony. While its musical and compositional merits could be debated, the idea behind combining rock with classical (in this case, rather pseudo-classical) music was of much greater ingenuity than that of the rest of the company combined."
5,Women Love It On You,"I learned a long time ago to only buy quality fragrances and so I only have a few at any given time but I always have this one on hand. No cologne should be noticeable from a distance greater than an embrace and this one is very strong at first, but just be sure to put it on a half hour or so before you go out and you'll be fine. It quickly settles down and stays in for the long haul. I never fail to get positive comments from women when I wear it. It has a clean scent with citrus notes yet smells masculine, not feminine. Trust me, women will love this scent on you."
5,sexy fragrance,"When I smell this on my boyfriend it gives me the chills and I'm immediately turned on. Very masculine and natural, like how I want a man to smell."
3,Meh.,"A fairly generic fragrance, it starts off with a strong scent of baby powder and coco puffs, followed shortly by sweet citrus (like fruit stripe gum). Like a great many men's fragrances this one, once applied to my skin turns very sweet, almost unpleasantly so. Hopefully it will go a different direction on yours. For me it's ok, if a bit feminine. I don't expect I'll buy another. And this 3.4 oz. spray bottle will likely end up in the back of a drawer, forgotten, and then rediscovered some years later. ""Oh, that!"" I'll probably say, ""What was I thinking?"" and then toss it."
1,Givenchy,I did not like the product. Givenchy had a great product called Xeryus. Then they changed the formula and it was terrible!
2,Este perfume huele muy mal!,Compre el producto por la publicidad que se le ha dado; luego de ello me arrepentí ya que no huele tan bien como lo esperaba.Hubiera preferido haber gastado mi dinero en Hugo Boss o algo asi.
1,STINKY,I bought this without first smelling it based upon a recommendation from someone. The stuff stinks. It smells like rotten coffee poured on someone wearing too much cheap cologne. I threw it away. It is gaggingly bad. I don't know how they can call this cologne. The bottle is the only thing worth anything.
2,i suppose its worthwhile.,"not the greatest book. lots of military references, a few decent tips, and a bit of a waste of time. If you really care about your actions, and if you want to change, there are much better books. This is a book about pornography just merely avoiding it. If you really want to change your life to be pure rather than just learning to stay away from porn(which is a short term solution not a long term way of life)you need to read and think about more than this book has to offer.Try joshua harris's I kissed dating goodby, or the smaller books in the new testament- phillipains and collosians and such. perhaps even Bonhoeffer's Life Together. These will give you a much better ground to serve god from than the negative ""avoiding porn""."
3,An equivalent book for women?,"This was a very good book for letting me into the world of men and their struggles with sexuality. However, as you may have gathered it is not very helpful for us single women who have strong libidos and face daily temptations. I had read this book not realizing it was just for men, and I was disappointed to find that out. I would like to see a similar book for women."
2,Quotes & comparisons anyone?,"I started out very motivated, but as I read on the numerous scripture references and comparisons to ships and the Navy got very old for me. It reminded me of a teacher I had who leaned 100% on the textbook and did hardly any original teaching or input of her own. There's a book called ""No More Excuses"" by Tony Evans that addresses this subject much better."
1,"Definitely NOT ""Red""",When searching for new Red material I was led to this album-definitely not Christian artist Red. There are two recordings by Red that are excellent! Check out End of Silence and Innocence & Instinct. Can't wait for more recordings from them.
2,The worst book I've read in years.,"Luckily I was given a copy of this book. I have read the top 100 books in this UFO/Alien genre and this is not one of them. I find it hard to believe this rambling, poorly edited, and disjointed book of Popes is a best-seller in the UK."
3,A Nice Read but....,"The author could have been more thorough in his explanation, not sure how I could use thie information presented without a clear understanding how to calculate the values nor am I aware of any charts that provide such information."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought it was going to describe what different objects meant, but it didn't. I recommend the book for a good read in spare time, but I wouldn't take the time if you're looking for something straightforward."
1,Ruining Nature,Why does the human race always has to destroy the beauty of Nature? A CD titled Whale Song should only contain Whale Songs. I'm getting tired searching for pure recordings of those wonderful Creatures. Without human Attachment.
4,One of the Best Ever,"I am a Tai Chi/qigong instructor and there are a few CD's that stand the test of time as a relaxing accompaniment for such meditative movement. This is one of them. On another level, is there any more perfect metaphor for the human condition than the song of a humpback whale echoing paintively through a vast and empty sea?"
4,Great Reiki music incorporating whale songs and sounds,Very soothing music that incorporates whale songs and sounds. Great for Reiki or any kind of relaxation. The whale songs and sounds are very natural sounding as part of the music.
5,Excellent,The book is as I suspected. Very clear and easy to read. I would recommend this book to people who are just learning about planning and scheduling.
2,A good collection of obsolete technology,"I'm afraid the Dockside review above is too optimistic about the scope of this book's coverage--little of what is here is useful to the owner of even a very old fiberglass production boat of any size. What this is, however, is a treasury of obsolete technologies for people with specialty interests such as owners or keepers of wooden schooners and the like. There are excellent diagrams of line-splicing jigs and tons of advice on wooden deck and hull painting/protection. The book was also intended for a British audience and takes up a lot of space on the usual British things such as instruction in the unthinkable practice of leaning a boat against stone piers when the tide goes out...If you are someone dealing with an antique or wooden boat you will want this for your collection; if you are surrounded by fiberglass, best to look elsewhere."
3,smells nice,"This product has a faint scent of lavender if you stick your nose right in it. I would have liked a stronger scent. It had no effect on making my baby sleep, though, and she doesn't play with it."
4,Cute and smells nice,"I don't know that the baby ever cared for it, but I wouldnt mind having a pillow that smells and feels like this. It's cute and smells nice."
5,Lavender Lab really works!,"I got the Lavender Lab -- and it really works. The scent is not too strong; it's calming and very relaxing. My daughter took the first one to college, so I had to buy a second one. Recommended!"
1,Overpriced stuffed toy,"My daughter is 10 months old and prefers every other stuffed toy we have (about 20 of them) to this puppy. I don't know why it has such good reviews. Every part of the puppy is tied by a string to the body, so it's very rigid. The attached blanket is a hazard to babies, as they can easily slip their heads between the puppy and the blanket."
3,Cute puppy,"This is a cute little puppy that my son might someday play with. However, I didn't find the lavender scent to be very strong even after squeezing the puppy (per the instructions). I also wrongly assumed that the puppy would be more like a floppy stuffed animal and he is made to stay in one position. Overall, this is a cute toy but I'm not sure it really lives up to its intended purpose."
3,"cute, but pointless",yeah it smell like lavender Barely- It's cute but that about it... Not worth the price
1,Awful! Sorry!,"I loved Marty Balin's emergence as a soloist (like Miracles, With Your Love, Runaway, etc.) and his first solo LP (Hearts, Atlanta Lady)......but this one doesn't sound anything like that. I bought it and was disappointed not to find ONE song I even halfway liked.Overproduced, too rock-oriented... perhaps likable to his earlier hippy days.I gave it a shot, but donated this one to my local thrift store."
4,better generation,always thought this guy was one of the best rockvocalists. this generous cd gives many reasons martywas the true soul of jefferson airplane/starship.the version of volunteers on the cd is closer to the way itused to sound at the fillmore east in 1969. electric..
2,Oral Vitamin B-12,I used this product twice daily for two months and was still deficient in serum B-12 as confirmed by blood test. I am unconvinced any oral B-12 can work for my serious nutritional deficiency. I will stick to injections. I do wish it had worked.
4,So Many Bad Reviews,"This film was recommended to me and I quickly found out it was out of print so I checked out Amazon. The reviews listed at the time were wretched, all one star and yuck. The film was available for 5 bucks so I bought it. Well this film is wonderful. It's a look at the culture of the late 60's from a youth perspective with humor and music of the time. It's something like the first music video with a humanist, historic bent. I think all the reviews panning this film are comming from a political viewpoint that doesn't care for anything different or critical of the status quo."
1,"YEAH IT'S LOUSY, BUT...","It's now billed as a Richard Pryor film. In truth, Pryor makes a short, mildly funny, very dated cameo. The cast is unusual and varied. Besides Pryor the film features (are you ready?) The Ace Trucking Company; John Lennon; Yoko Ono; Fred Willard; Ron Carey; Michael O'Donoghue; Andy Warhol; Peter Max; Al Goldstein; BB King; Joan Baez and Sha Na Na! Worth seeing (maybe) once just to see what a mess it is! Unbelievable."
1,Stinks.,"Stinks. The only film I ever saw in a theater (re-released in the early 80's) where virtually everyone left before the film ended. Richard Pryor wasn't very funny, the pre-Saturday Night Live skits were very boring. The only benefit that video has is that you can fast forward the entire film."
1,Poor Time capsule,"This is an oddly assembled and poorly edited patchwork quilt of film clips of people and music representing the ""counterculture"" of the late 60s-early 70s era. Basically, the nude scenes, profanity, etc. seem to be more for shock value than for making any statement, and nothing seems to make any particular point. Not even good for historical purposes, it's unlikely that you would want to see this more than once, or even all the way through upon the first viewing. The Richard Pryor scenes are only mildly interesting. I recall in the reviews for Frankie Avalon's ""Back To The Beach,"" a reviewer said, ""It stinks. It smells like poo poo. "" The same is true for this film"
5,Great Atmosphere and Characters!,"This was the first Mary Stewart I read and I was hooked. It is still a favorite along with Madam Will You Talk and The Ivy Tree. The author is masterly in setting up the suspence and romance along with compelling action.In Wildfire at Midnight, the setting is the Isle of Skye and the tension becomes quite frightening as the heroine feels drawn to a possible murderer. Someone is committing ritual murders on the mountainside and the murderer is likely one of the guests at the remote lodge."
5,Definitely my favourite ( so far),"I have read a number of Mary Stewart's books and although I love them all, Wildfire at MIdnight is definitely my favourite. I love the setting of the book and Mary Stewart's description which is as beautiful and as real to the reader as in the other books I have read. I love her main character, Gianetta and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a great mystery with some wonderful description and a little romance as a bonus."
4,"This title is out of print, but...","It was reissued in 2004, and that slightly-different title (Virgil Fox Plays the Wanamaker Grand Court Organ) is currently available on Amazon"
1,TOO DULL TO BEE. CALLED CUTTERS!,So dissatisfied. I never used anything so dull. These should not be called cutters. I use online order to save shopping time - who has time to bother with returns. I feel so rippped off.
4,Decent,"Product is good for a budget pair. Longer handles would be helpful but not sure if metal is strong enough for the force. I work in HVAC and use them daily, haven't had them fail yet."
5,It's AWESOME!,This single is one of the best that I know of...I love the song it's just so funny...and it has a great beat so you can dance/cruise/chill to it w/out any worries...
3,Hits and Covers,"This is an import from Europe. The 3 cd set has some of his hits interspersed with cover songs and instrumentals with Glen on guitar. Everything from his bluesy version 'Learnin' The Blues', cover of 'He Ain't Heavy He's My Brother' which rivals the Neil Diamond and Hollies versions, hit's like 'Rhinestone Cowboy', instrumental 'Classical Gas', 'King Of The Road', etc. The sound quality is variable dependent on which album the tune was culled. Liner notes included. A reasonably good set."
3,odd selection of songs,"For a 3-disc anthology, this set has too many poor and odd choices. Yes, the obvious hits are all here, but this disc also has more than a bit of schlock; see the unnecessary covers of songs like ""My Way"" and ""The Impossible Dream"", or big band arrangements on weak tunes like ""Learnin' the Blues"". The other problem with this collection is that it doesn't flow at all, jumping around Glen's career from 60s to 70s and back again. A much, much better ""Hits"" collection to get is the 2-CD set called the ""Capitol Years."" No need to get this one unless you are a real completist, but then again the boxed set would cover more material and do a better job of quality material. This one is just plain strange."
3,decent item . .but needed work to be good,"I got this partly for the long reach and the price. It is true you do get what you pay for. I bought several different pliers and all needed to have some work to make them work properly. They final machining of the product was missing. Cutter edges did not meet fully, pliers had gaps between surfaces. It took a little bit of filing and they are good. But don't anticipate them to be a great item."
1,you get the wrong version of the movie,This looks like you will b getting the newer version from 2003 but you really get the 1950's version of this movie
4,Good but slow,"The movie was worth watching, and gets bonus points for the brief history lesson. The story lagged and was boring at parts and was a little confusing but I suppose there was a lot to historically cover in a relatively short 2 hours.I like Michael Caine in a supporting role, but did not entirely enjoy him as the main character in this particular movie."
5,Dogmatics 81-86,The Dogmatics were awesome. you can read my dogmatics story here http://redsox1918.tripod.com/dogmatic.html
4,Too Little About More With Less,"I've had the pleasure of hiking into the San Gabriel Mountains with Paul MacCready. I've gone to lectures at Caltech where MacCready was in the audience and I've looked on his [ever present] notebooks with wonder. More With Less is a good read and a quick read, but it left me wanting a full-fledged biography of Paul MacCready AND a more complete volume on efficiency in this high tech world. Despite this, I enjoyed Paul Ciotti's take on both subjects. As an introduction to both subjects, More With Less does a very good job. If you are looking for a more detailed book on either subject, my guess is that you'll be disappointed."
4,Sweet Sound!,"I recently saw Emily live in West Virginia, where she now lives, performing with just her husband on the guitar. I enjoyed the show so much I bought two of her CDs there. If you like bluegrass, you'll like this, but it's more than bluegrass. There's blues, jazz, soul. Emily has a sweet voice. On the CDs she has her band and backup vocals, which make the performances even better than they were live."
1,Least favorite book in my pattern library,"There are some interesting concepts and stitches in this book, but the sweaters are out-of-date and are not designed with the comfort of the wearer in mind. In addition, the patterns are difficult to follow. There is no information to help the reader alter the patterns in any way for a better fit. A very experienced crocheter would be able to manipulate these patterns into something lovely, perhaps, but otherwise don't disappoint yourself!"
2,Better crochet sweater books out there . . .,"Instead of this book, which is quite dated, I would recommend Crochet With Style: Fun-To-Make Sweaters for All Seasons by Melissa Leapman or Today's Crochet by Crochet Guild of America. I found Nola Theiss's book to be pretty vague as to types and amount of yarn needed for most of the projects, and she has you knit (!) the ribbing for her sweaters. Which is a drag if you don't knit, yes?"
3,Pretty tasty crackers,These crackers are actully pretty tasty. The drawback is that the package is very small and very expensive. They aren't THAT yummy to pay such a high price!
2,Can't decide if they're better than nothing.,"I was so dying for a low carb cracker so I could enjoy some Atkin's approved tuna fish or egg salad on it, that I ordered four boxes of these crackers in different flavors. I anxiously waited a week for their arrival and immediately dug into one....Let me tell you what these taste exactly like. When you were young, were you ever feeling adventurous and wondered what your pet Fido's dog biscuits tasted like? I did and used to chew half-heartedly on one now and then. Remember that hard, mealy taste?Smackaroos crackers taste exactly like dog biscuits. Flatter, thinner dog biscuits.I mean, I'm eating mine because I laid out $25 for four tiny boxes (and yes, the boxes are tiny) and don't have money to waste. But I can't decide if they're better than nothing.So if you want to sample Smackaroos, go to a PetSmart or your neighbor's house and borrow a dog biscuit.Same darn flavor."
2,Old wine in new bottles,"Other reviewers have pointed out that what is new in this book is highly suspect. Another problem is that a lot of what is true is not new. The basic themes of incompetent allied generalship and the unfavorable casualty exchange rate were first presented by Churchill in ""The World Crisis,"" and have been fully documented in numerous works since then. At best, this book brings the similar follies of the French to the attention of the English-reading world that tends to ignore the French role in the war. For a healthy alternate view, read Paddy Griffith's ""Battle Tactics of the Western Front"" to learn about some British officers who actually did develop new tactics adapted to the realities of the trench war."
2,"Meh, not that great","First I will preface this review with the following disclaimer: I found the approach the author took offensive. I had to keep reading just to see how offensive it got. Now that that is out of the way, overall this book misses the mark. While the contribution of the AEF to the end of the War can not be discounted, the author discounts far too heavily the efforts of the French and the British in the previous four years of conflict. The book also fails to adequately explore the problems inside of Germany that play a part in the War's end. The book is too U.S. centric to be considered objective. Also, the author devotes only one or two chapters to explaining the contribution of the AEF towards ending the war. I don't think that is enough space to effectively make an argument, even a faulty one, convincing!!"
1,awful...,"not only does mosier revise history in whichever manner he wants to, but his highly irritating and arrogant writing style will put off even the most neutral and open-minded of readers. mosier's books are not history, they are 'history according to mosier.'AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE"
2,"Learning phrases isn't enough, need to be able to reply","I had high hopes for this audio CD, but found it to be a one sided exercise. The problem is that there are over 700 Greek phrases, but the phrases are spoken in isolation and not repeated unless you replay the section. It may be great to learn some Greek phrases, but the CD doesn't provide the listener with appropriate responses - so you will be able to say a phrase, but not understand the response. The book that comes with it is very good, with each phrase spelled out in Greek and also showing the pronunciation. If you're looking to learn some conversational Greek, this isn't the CD for you. Also, the audio is very bad - the English speaker is extremely soft while the Greek speaker is fine. I had to process each file through ""Levelator"" software to balance the voices."
3,Good,"The translation is clear and easy to understand. I would have preferred that the words/phrases most important to a traveler i.e. please, thank you, how much does it cost, etc. were together in order for me to repeat them over an over which is difficult to do on a disc. Nicely done and well worth the money just the same."
5,Nice new look for Jetfire,"Pros: vehicle mode is sturdy and solid and looks great; good color scheme; missile launchers on wings can come off and be used in robot mode as hand weapons; interesting touch with the flip-up tail with rocket launchersPros or Cons: fairly simple transformation; robot mode has no central torso, only a chest and a back; hands can be difficult to pull out of armsCons: missile launchers fall off of wings with a slight nudge"
4,great gift,I was looking everywhere for this particular toy and coudn't find it even in larger toy stores. Now this toy is being thorughly enjoyed by my son.
4,"Exactly as stated, 4th quality","Delivery took longer than expected. The quality of the product is exactly as stated, 4th quality. There were a lot of pieces that were were not cut of extra plastic and a few screws missing that I needed to replace."
3,a lttle on the small side,for what i bought the skeleton for it will do fine with school it is a little smaller then i thought .
3,Sudden spike in cost!!!!,"I loved cooking with these low carb beans. I had been getting the pack of 12 of Eden's Black Soy Beans through Amazon's subscribe and save program for just about $18 for the last several years. I am now told by Amazon that they no longer provide the subscribe and save program for this item, and the cost is now almost $40!! Unfortunately, this has put it way out of reach for my pocket book."
2,Concerned,I ordered a case of these black soy beans with the anticipation of making a low carb chili. I was extremely disappointed when the case arrived and 2/3 of the cans were dented. I am concerned that they are not safe to use!
5,Great way to enjoy beans and low carb too,"With the net carbs being ""1"", this is a great way to enjoy my favorite recipes that call for beans. I have mashed and used for refry beans, used in minestroni soup, used in burritos with a low carb tortillas, etc. They remind me of black bean in flavor just a bit more ""chewy"". The service on the product was quick."
5,Love these black soy beans!,"I am not a fan of soy beans, but decided to try these black soy beans. They are wonderful - kind of crisp, with a ""nutty"" flavor and very filling. I put them in chili and bean soup - any dish that calls for beans. Wonderful diet food too as they are almost 100% fiber."
3,Can be good,I am on a low carb diet and these work great for it. I make chili and they kinda just take on the taste of the chili. They do work well for a low carb diet. I have made a bean dip with them also.
5,Just neat,"I hated trying to fill my little tea ball, screwing the top back on, and cleaning out. This you just squeeze and fill. When cleaning, you just squeeze and dump and then rinse out is so easy. Will have to buy a few more for friends."
4,Does the trick,"My dog hates this (and every other) diaper. But if he'd learn not to pee inside, it wouldn't be a problem. For the most part, this diaper succeeds in REMINDING him that he doesn't want to go in the house. (He's not old or infirm, just stubborn.) And if he forgets, the rug is saved. If you get one, you need two, so you can put the second on while the first is in the wash. This wrap diaper does affect his gait in some way that he struggles to get up the stairs when it's on. He's only about 22 lbs. and wears the medium. We put a woman's pad inside."
2,Not worth the money.,"I have a little dog who likes to mark in the house, so I bought this small male dog diaper and some liners from Simple Solutions. The elastic on this garment left a red welt and chafing on my dog's belly. I know the diaper's not too tight,since it's supposed to fit up to 13"" and my little guy is 11"" where he's getting sore. The liners are so small that you'd need x-ray vision to get them lined up right when your dog wears the diaper. I don't, so the fabric got wet, and totally defeated the purpose of having liners. I ended up using two at a time just to use them up. Ugh. My advice? Go on eBay and see how many people are out there making and selling male dog belly wraps that don't need liners. You can get several for the price of one Simple Solution male dog diaper and they're custom made!"
1,Doesn't stay on,"The first 3 - 4 times my male 20 pounder pug wore this, it stayed on, now he knows how to get it off every time. The medium size seemed a little tight for him, so I got a large, the large is too big, I sewed it smaller, but he get the large one off also."
5,This is great!,"Our 13 year old cockapoo has incontinence problems, especially as we are about to go out and have to use an elevator to get out from our condo. So, this wrap is terrific. The medium fits him with no problems. He is 20 pounds, and it pulls tight enough to ensure no leaks. The Velcro is so strong, that it takes 2 hands to pull it off once we get outside.For best results, and to minimize the need for washing, we use 2 super maxi pads as liners. This way is he starts to go, we can let him finish, then pull off the wrap, and remove the liners before it gets to the wrap.So long as you position the wrap correctly, it does not leak. So, human error is the only problem here, not product at all.We highly recommend this product."
4,Runs small,"I have a 12 yr old Yorkie, who has had to have multiple bladder stone removal surgeries. After each surgery he has a couple of months that he has accidents. This wrap has made the recovery process much more tolerable. Although, I was very surprised that the wrap was a bit tight, since my Yorkie only weighs 5 lbs."
1,bulky doggy wear even a size small could fit a med dog,it is too bulky i bought the sixe for my dog but still is to big to bulky. what a waste of my money
1,HORRIBLE ITEM..DO NOT BUY!,"FIRST OF ALL WE ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE WE HAD TO PUT A STAR. IT DOESN'T DESERVE ANY STARS. WE BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR OUR HANDICAPPED DOG. HE IS INCONTINENT AND THIS ITEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR INCONTINENT MALES. THE FABRIC IS THIN, CHEAP & SLIPPERY. THE SIZING IS OFF AS WELL. BASED ON THE SIZING OUR BASSET SHOULD BE A LARGE AND THE LARGE IS TOO BIG AND SLIPS OFF, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS 65 POUNDS AND WITHIN THE SIZES INDICATED ON THE PACKAGE. WE HAVE BOUGHT WRAPS FROM THIS SAME COMPANY THAT HAVE DENIM FABRIC. IT IS THICKER AND BETTER. DO NOT BUY THESE WITH THE TEAL BLUE FABRIC YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Not nearly worth the money,"Absolutely worthless! It fits poorly, does not cover the anus, and the urine leaks COMPLETELY THROUGH the diaper!! I can just imagine him lying on my couch in this urine soaked piece of crap (no pun intended)! If that's not enough, it only wraps around the abdomen with velcro and elastic bands. That's right, it doesn't even wrap around the legs, so my dog keeps sliding it off with little effort. Definitely plenty of room for improvement. I'm returning it tomorrow."
1,Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap Small,"Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap, SmallHi, I purchased the washable male wrap small trying to purchase the simple solution small dog diaper. I returned the male wrap small 7/2010. I am still waiting on my replacement item. I requested change or refund of the item when i returned the item. I will gladly write a review once i recieve the item i'll paid for.I hope the seller Violet read this & response if not i will contact Amazon next..........Betty sturgan"
2,Nice Idea...,"While this product is a very good idea, it was not properly or effectively executed. First of all, I have a 12lb Miniature Pinscher, and the size medium is kind of tight on him. And, he is by no means overweight. Occasionally, he likes to mark, so we figured this would be a good purchase. We were wrong! The item is not soft to the touch, and it has tight elastic, meaning it bunches too much and tends to squeeze his belly. There seems to be extra fabric, and it almost looks like a diaper or ballerina tutu on him. He looks absurd. Our dog does not particularly mind the product, but it slips and slides, making it ineffective. I noticed some wraps on Amazon that were fleece and appeared to be better quality. I will be purchasing them next."
3,If I could make a wish...,"My coon hound tolerates wearing this very well, much to my surprise. Since he's a big licker, things sometimes get moved around; although the wrap stays where it needs to be, sometimes my dog misses the pad and soaks the wrap. If I had a magic wand, I would make it waterproof. Good news: it washes very well in the washing machine on the normal cycle and I've dried it in my dryer on high heat with no ill effects."
4,Great with a small baby diaper for absorbency,"The large size fits my medium size dog pretty well. We've found that a size 1 baby diaper (with tabs pulled off) fits perfectly inside it and around my dog's boy parts - and rarely leaks. He seems to like it better than peeing around the house because he waits patiently for me to put it on him and is sleeping better. We do what we have to when our loved ones get old, right?I only gave it 4 stars because there is virtually no absorbency without a liner of some sort and the sizing seems really small to me. But with the diaper, it's perfect!"
3,Simple Solution Male Wrap,"I am not going to say that these wraps don't work at all, but they do not work on my dog (20 lb. Miniature Schnauzer) and will definitely be returning it. The edge of the wrap hits right on the edge of his ""privates"" barely covering it, and when he peed it went on the inside edge of the wrap and missed the absorbent liner because the liner does not go right to the edge (there is a 1"" gap from the liner to the edge), so he just ended up peeing on the fabric part and got the wrap all wet. It just doesn't fit him right."
1,A Total Wash,"This worked fine for a few days, but the very first time we washed it, all the elastic just fell out of it. It was completely destroyed. It was a complete waste of money. I suppose if a person were inclined to hand wash this item it may last more than one washing. I was very, very disappointed."
4,Would definitely recommend,"I ordered this for our toy poodle who is getting older. Fortunately, the wrap has been absorbent enough on its own for his needs, as he usually only wears it at night. We have not needed any additional pads as other reviewers have indicated. We thought for sure he would not like wearing it, however he has yet to acknowledge that it's even on him. We received the item only a few days after ordering which was a giant plus for us. One thing to note before ordering is size. I originally ordered a size Small and it was significantly too small for our 10-lb toy poodle. We ended up ordering a size Medium for him. It fits pretty good circumference wise, however it is a little too big for him as it covers a larger area than needed. Even though it is slightly too large for him, there has been no leaks. I would have rated it 5 stars other than that."
3,Get size first,I have a poodle mix and I thought he has big so I bought a med and it is loose on him-but small is way too tight on him-Make sure what size you get
1,Boston Terrier- does not stay on,"Unfortunately, this wrap does not stay on our Boston Terrier and we've tried two different sizes. Although, if it did stay on his body, I'm confident that it would stop his spraying. He doesn't mind wearing it and the velcro is strong. It's just his body shape that is challenging."
1,Did not fit...at all.,"I got these for my 17 lb pug. I chose this brand because of the lower price point and convenience. The medium was wayyyy too big. He had walked out of it within minutes and it was not at all adjustable. The elastic on the outside edges causes the band to bunch up like a loose diaper and the edges are lined with a very itchy fabric. I imagine this fabric causing some problems on my pug's sensitive belly. The inside is lined with cheap nylon netting and the outside fabric wasn't much softer. Overall, very disappointed. Returned the next day."
2,body shape,"Boston terrier has wrong body shape ,kept sliding off, no tighting it didnt work. I am sure it could work on other body types,"
2,Definiately not one step down from a medium,"if i could give anyone a comparison: Small is like a size 4 in ladies apparrel, and the medium is like a size 10. the medium is to big for my larger chinese crested who weighs 20 pounds and the small is too too small for my smaller chinese crested whose waist is 13 inches. so both i purchase were a waste. i will have to attempt to make the myself. i will have to donate them to the humane league."
1,Does not stay on!,"We purchased this for an aging Jack Russel with incontinence issues. Within 30 seconds of being on, he rolled around and managed to get the wrap off immediately. This is something to avoid if your dog is high energy or likes to play."
4,Arrived in good shape,The item arrived in good shape and in the time frame promised. i was a little disappointed in the fit and bulkiness but I guess you cant expect every dog to be shaped the same. :o) They did the job.
3,best for mild drips,product works good if you have a mild wetting. i had to use adult pads inside the band and it worked great. overall though im pleased with the product.
3,It worked okay.,"Had an older incontinent dog. We had to use adult human protection pads to keep this from being a waste of effort. We had to buy two more wraps to allow for washing the wraps as there was leakage from the pads. The elastic on one of the three wraps broke after just a few washes. However, it allowed our old guy a few more months of living with the family even though he was unable to hold his urine."
5,A House Saver!,"We do dog rescues through Westie Rescue. The rescues come with many problems - many are not neutered - and they are nervous. The first thing males want to do is mark this new strange territory. We use the medium size for adult male Westies. The wrap is easy to use and very well tolerated. A feminine pad helps reduce laundry. A must for those dogs who tend to ""save a little"" (or save a lot!) for indoor use."
1,Too small,Very disappointed. There is no way this fits a 15 lb dog. My dog is a 9 lb maltese and it barely gets around him and it's certainly not comfortable.
4,It works,"The large diaper wrap was a little tight on my dog even with the velcro at the widest setting, and I was worried that the elastic might chafe him. The extra large size is REALLY big, though. I went back to the large size without a liner, and found that because the diaper has a flannel interior lining it works fine without any additional pad-type liner (my old dog doesn't leak much, just has trouble in the morning when he first gets up). I've got some non-elastic diaper bands in fun fabrics that I keep him in during the day (just in case) and I overnight him in the Simple Solutions elastic pants. They are the only brand I trust to leave him in overnight because they don't leak."
2,Made well but design is in question,"These wraps are sewn well with perfect material and provide excellent protection. I had a large dog and put a depends pad inside. However, the elastic is continuous and broke the skin down in front of the dog's private part. It didn't take long. He had to go on antibiotics to get over it. I tried a second time briefly, gave up and designed my own with a stretch with no elastic. I hope the company reads this."
4,"Dog in heat, male marking?? No problem!!","I have a female in her first heat, and a male who will not leave her alone. The wrap works wonderfully, and I coupled it with prissy pants for her.. Best purchase in the world.. I just wish the wrap didn't scrunch as much, but I haven't found a better one out there.. They can finally play together when I am around, and they are happy.."
2,Just okay.,"Bought the male wrap to keep my Alpha Male from marking on the condo we were renting. Well, it did work for that. However, it keeps sliding to his tail and must be adjusted often. He is not fond of it and rubs against the furniture to try to get it off."
3,Male wrap,The material of this wrap was not the same as the old wrap we have.The size seems the same but the wrap itself seems skinnier.It would have been nice to have a color description because the color is gawd awful we expected blue denim like the old one.
2,don't work well,I ordered this after i got a belt for my 5 pound chi...this was for my 10 pound mix. Once of them started marking so i decided to order belly belts.This brand doesn't seem to stay on. So i ordered another brand and it works wonderfully!
3,Alteration necessary.,"The medium size which I thought would fit is too large for my miniature dachshund, and the elastic edges bothered him. Because of his large chest, and small middle he is hard to fit. I loosened some of the elastic, and shortened the band for him. He's a shy dog, and recently would pee when strangers came into the house. Because of medical problems, we have had several home health care workers in and out of the house. This is saving my carpet and saving my dog, too."
5,dog diapers,this product is easy to us and effective on male dogs to keep them for marking there territory. it was exactly as stated in the add and arrived quickly.
2,Kept the pee pee in but put a good sore on my dogs underside.,"I have a three year old pug that started lifting his leg indoors after we moved. My mother in law told me about these and I ran out and got one for my local Pet smart because I didn't want to wait for one online and make an easy return if I didn't like it.Well I'll say it worked great and did what it set out to do but after a week or so my Pug had a nasty raw sore on the underside of his penis sheath. There is an elastic band on either side of the band and this is what rubbed him and made a sore. I even got a size larger and even though the middle portion was comfortable the elastic still created the same problem and got another raw sore.So I highly recommend the concept, I'm not happy with this particular product and I am now shopping online for another kind hopping to avoid the same problem again."
2,Might be better things out there,"This band is elastic on the sides, so it's stretchy, which I didn't realize when I bought it. I got a medium and it's too large for my 16-lb pug. It bunches up around his tummy and looks like a skirt. It does the job I guess, but it's not comfortable for him and he can slip out of it pretty easily."
3,Stretched out of shape already,I purchased four of these at the same time. I had previously purchased one at a local pet store and when I saw these offered online for this price I bought the last four they had. One of the bands was used only a couple of times and the elastic on one side stretched completely out of shape and therefore it is unusable. Just hoping the other three hold up longer than a couple of wears. Wondering if they had been around a long time in extreme heat or something to cause the elastic to give up that quickly.
2,Be prepared for this thing to STINK.,"My dog has to wear then as we are walking to his pee spot and as we are walking back because he is an excited pee'er. But even though I wash it thoroughly every time afterwards, it has gained this permanent stench that stinks up whatever room it's in. Not to mention that the fabric is a pain to wash in the first place.Perhaps it is well suited for someone who only needs it for special occasions."
4,Male wrap,I put it on the dog and in 5 minutes he had torn it off. The product is good but a puppy will not wear it so it didn't do my any good. I f he where old and not still chewing up everything in site. Then this is a good product.
2,Simple Solution Washable Male Wrap - Medium,"I had previously bought a small size at a pet shop but it was a little too small. So I ordered a medium through Amazon and it was way too big. So I ended up returning it and getting another small. The new small was not as substantial as the original one I bought at the pet shop. The new one is made of synthetic materials whereas the original one was made from denim and flannel. The new one was cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for.Simple Solution Washable Diapers, Small"
1,If only I swore.....,"I would give this product -1 star if I could. But since I can't, suffice it to say, I have had nothing but problems with this product since the first use. I purchased two for two small male dogs that haven't been neutered..YET. These fellas have a habit of marking behind each other, and these were supposed to help with that. Well, they don't. They bunch up over the back and underneath where they are supposed to cover up their privates. I am constantly following the dogs around and monitoring them to make certain they are covered up. They usally aren't, so I have to re-adjust them. It is very frustrating and such a waste of time. I will have to find another solution, spend even more money. At least until, and IF their being nuetered helps.You could probably do better with a babies diaper (the tab closing type) with a hole cut out for the tail."
4,Secret to save LOTS of MONEY on these....,"I have figured out that you DO NOT need to buy all the expensive liners for these doggie diaper products. They are thin, expensive and do not hardly hold any liquid well.The solution? Any of the hundreds of maxi pad / panty liner products you would buy for adults.In particular, a box of 16 medium Kotex liners is $1...they are at least 3 times thicker and more absorbant that these thin liners that are $6-7 a box of 22. They fit perfectly into the diaper, have the same strong adhesive, and cost me 1/6th the price.Yes, it was a little embarassing to buy these at first, but considering I needed a solution that was less expensive, I decided that my little guy is more important. Besides, I can buy a month's supply for $2 now.Hope this helps you dog lovers on a budget like me!"
4,"Columbia, SC",I bought this for my greyhound that likes to mark in our second bedroom as soon as we leave. It works great for this purpose. He learned not to mark but will use the diaper if he needs to go before we make it back. It stays on well and doesn't leak at all. He deos mess with it at times but has never actually gotten it off and it doesn't seem to bother him - he just lieks to check it out every once in a while. Overall I would recommend this product
2,ok at first but now leaks all the time,"when i first received the wrap about a month ago, i thought it was a miracle. it seemed to hold everything and unless it got shifted during his sleep, it never leaked. well, about a month later and after a few hand washings, the wrap leaks all the time now (i use incontinence pads stuck in it). it doesn't hold as tight as it did just a month ago so i have to wash the wrap almost everyday. it sags and has loosen quite a bit. i just ordered the tinker wrap so hopefully that one will work better."
3,Good for protecting floors but sizing is off.,"My dogs have accidents and these wraps have helped save my carpets. However i have a few issues. You do need to put something inside of them to soak up the urine. I use mens Depends guards. I know others use women's sanitary pads but that didn't hold all of the urine. Depends seem to work better. Also, the diapers fit great when i first got them but after washing a few times, they are more loose. I went down a size and it was way too small, so my dogs occasionally wiggle out of them.All in all, They seem to be the best option available on the market for right now."
3,"Good, but my dog gets these off",The diaper is made well and shipped quickly. I'm only giving it a three star because my dog is very good at getting this diaper off. Yet the size smaller would be way too small for him.
4,Praying with Jesus,"This book is written by David Yonggi Cho, pastor of the world largest church with members more than 700,000. Pastor Cho is teaching us about the Lord's prayer. I would encourage every Christian to read this book to have an in-depth understanding on prayer and about the kingdom of God. Good to read even if you are an experience Christian."
5,The World Turned Right Again: Walter Gibson Explains Bosch,"Art is a mystical and magical phenomenon. For that reason, few scholars of the art of the past can resist the temptation to cloud their work with terminal over-analysis and obfuscating jargon. Fortunately, Walter Gibson (like St. Anthony in the desert) does not succumb to these demons. With a clear eye, he reviews the work, thought and religious sentiment of one of the most mystical painters in human history; however, he never lets daylight in upon magic. The reader finishes this delightful little tome on Bosch with a better understanding of his work, but a profound respect for his mystery. Gibson is erudite without being obfuscatory, respectful without being unduly ingratiating. An excellent work by someone who truly loves and understands art."
3,Little Insight Here,"As someone without an art background I nevertheless felt drawn to the works of Hieronymus Bosch. I sensed that I was witnessing the demons of the subconcious leaping onto canvass. Bosch was sending the world a profound message hidden in plain sight. It was a message I wanted to better understand.The author Carl Linfert does a passable job of describing what's in a painting, but is unable to shed any light on what it means. Thank you, Mr Linfert, but all sighted individuals can see for themselves what you point out. Perhaps I expected too much from him. I wanted Carl Jung or at least Joseph Campbell and I got a plodding, pedantic art historian.This book is an attractive addition to any art history collection, just don't expect any great insights."
2,skip this one,"This book was disappointing. It was more concerned with the life of Champollion and, unfortunately, not enough detail on the decipherment. There have been earlier books that have done it better"
5,The Savant of Ra,"The Keys of Egypt elegantly combines an in-depth biography of Jean Francois Champollion, with a detailed chronology of the saga to decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs. Champollion, a French language savant (Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Chaldean, Coptic), was the first person in over a thousand years to decipher and read not only the hieroglyphs, but also the ancient Egyptian hieratic and demotic scripts as well. Toiling in ill health and poverty, and suffering political persecution and professional jealously, Champollion nevertheless conquered one of the greatest challenges of his or any time. His achievement unlocked the ""keys"" of ancient Egypt, which in turn was the genesis of Egyptology and our modern attempts to understand a civilization whose longevity and accomplishments continue to astound. An immense amount of biographical, Napoleonic Period, and ancient information is contained in this book, and I highly recommend it."
3,"Cute, but not his best","I love Rucker's work... but this was not his best. This novel involves people making 'wishes.' And the wishes really aren't thought through very well, even when the novel suggests they are. This is obviously one of Rudy's earlier works... its fun and enjoyable, but he has produced much better."
3,"Not the greatest, but still enjoyable","Ok.Weird, ... but I liked it.A semi-futuristic world is altered when a couple of bore scientists uncover a way to essentially alter the universe (or universes) anyway they wish. But only 3 times. A mixture of sci-fi, advanced mathematics, philosophy and depth psychology. The adventures are fast paced enough and there's just enough mix of silliness and reflection to entertain."
4,GOOD MOVIE,MY HUBBY AND I DO AGREE ON ONE THING WE BOTH LOVE FACT BASED STORIES. WE LIKED THIS ONE ALOT. THE SUFFERING THESE PEOPLE ENDURE FOR A BETTER LIFE IS HEART JERKING. MUST SEE MOVIE.
5,Listen,"This was recommended to me by a friend, an Orthodox Jew, who correctly intuited that this Catholic would benefit substantially from reading it. Rabbi Soloveitchik's little book belongs among the (my) short list of spiritual classics. And while he speaks with particular insight into the modern condition, his concerns are perennial, and address the heart of authentic spirituality."
4,Twice the pleasure,"This, like so many similar CDs are for training bird known to ""mimic,"" and it works, but the best part was the relaxing background. Very cool and relaxing.Relaxation"
3,Almost There,"The ""Easy Way to Teach your Canary to Sing"" CD does work. Our canary looks around for another male every time we play it. He has picked up some trilling but has yet to break out in a song."
4,Feathered Phonics Vol 7,My canaries responded to the songs immediately.Track 12 & 13 are harsh sounding and you hear a lot of cage racket. Those two tracks could have been left off.
2,Waste of money,"My bird didn't learn anything from this. I put it in the cd player and set it to repeat for hours a day. I found out if you want your bird to sing, put it outside on the porch. Birds sing to find mates. Wont find one inside so why sing? Some canaries just don't sing. My $80 bird was one of them. Eventually one day a rat broke into its cage on the porch and killed it. The rodent got more enjoyment from the bird than I."
3,Worthy of a viewing.,"The Inheritors was a fairly decent movie. I do have to admit that it's not very upbeat most of the time though. The film's plot deals with a farmer that is murdered, and a will is found in his house that surprisingly states that his land be left to the peasants that work on the farm for him. Instead of selling the land to a neighboring farmer that's greedy, the peasants decide to keep it and become farmers themselves to the dismay of certain people. The plot gets much deeper from there. I had to watch The Inheritors more than once to completely understand what I had missed during my inital viewing of it. The story, acting, music, and cinematography are pretty good. Lars Rudolph (one of the peasants named Severin who becomes a farmer) does a good job in his role and can be seen in Run Lola Run too. This film is Austrian with German dialogue. The Inheritors isn't one of my favorite movies, but I still think that it's pretty good and worth a watch."
4,"Not superb, but pretty good","This film is certainly worthy of more than one star, but it is not one of the greatest movies ever. Its just a pretty good movie (better than most mainstream Hollywood productions); I gave it 4 stars rather than 3 because I like originality. However, I could have done without the depression that is sure to set in upon completion of the movie. It has very good characters with complex composition (i.e. neither saints nor sinners, but real people with both good and bad qualities). One thing I liked in particular was that it was not too wordy; there are plenty of scenes that let the viewer think and take in unspoken, visual cues. All in all, this was a good movie worthy of viewing, but there are other movies I would recommend first."
3,It ain't that bad of a song.,"This song is okay,it is basically used for shock value.And to the person who said Enigma is better,are you insane?"
1,GARBAGE!,"Another trashy song from a talentless prostitute made simply for shock value but only to come up as stupid & degrading to society.Enough said!Now excuse me while I get back to listening to my class act, Oleta Adams."
1,good for a Novelty,this Song was Good for a laugh&the Video is a Real Roar as well.these are the kind of Songs that stick in your Mind for a certain time period&then they become whatever happen to Acts? this will be no exception to the Rule.Catchy Title Brain Dead Song but this is what goes for a Happening Song nowadays??
1,TRASH!,"Another stupid song that further degrades women all over the country. This is why I hate female rappers so much.Listen to Peter Gabriel, Oleta Adams, Enigma instead."
1,"One-hit wonder, if you can call this a hit","This has to be the worst song I heard last year. Anyone who liked this song either (a.) was 14 to 17 years old who just wanted to hear something ""dirty"" or (b.) needed something to listen to until Lil' Kim or Foxy Brown released a new album. The subject matter has been done before, see the aforementioned artists; plus the production is weak and her voice has an acquired taste. And she did such a good job on ""Freak Like Me""--oops, that's Adina Howard."
5,"""My Neck, My Back, Licky My P-=-y And My Cr-ck!""","That's what's wrong with Khia. She ain't dancin'. She got a yeast infection. ""All you ladies scratch that coo-hie like this, cause I know that s-it gotta itch."" Someone get her some Monistat FAST!!!!"
3,nice to buy from Amazon,"this is my replacement bit as the first one broke on first use. 2/3's of one cutting edge just sort of flaked off, thankfully imbedding itself in the wood and not me! manufacturing metal fault, at a guess. idk.again, thankfully, Amazon, in usual fashion, replaced it immediately. the second bit has worked fine so far or I would have rated it one star...."
5,An Amazing Life Story of God's Transforming Grace,"This is a book that you won't be able to put down. To read of how God in His mercy transformed Stephen's life from a life of total devastation and hopelessness into one of purpose and meaning and usefulness certainly builds one's faith and creates a desire to know this God of his. It encourages and gives hope to anyone who struggles with feelings of inferiority and ""what's the meaning to life - is it worth the living?"" Well worth the time and money - you will get more than you paid for!"
3,WTF? Where is....,Where is her great cover of ONE with U2? Or AS w/ George Michael? Or WHENEVER I SAY YOUR NAME w/ Sting? Or the new track with Aretha Franklin for the film BOBBY?
2,a so-so Greatest Hits Package,"no matter what title or name you call it, this is a Greatest Hits package. it's a reflection over her career. Problem on this Disc is that there are songs missing. Mary J.Bliege to me did Her best stuff between 92-95. to me that was her Peak&Prime. she has been able to roll on the Drama Carpet for all of her career&it's worked. She isn't much of a Vocalist,but a stylist who was able to get her style over. with Hip-Hop beats, Samples&Loops Mary rode over vintage Grooves&it has worked like a charm.""Be Happy"", Your'e all I need to get by with Methoid Man all still work. Her Mid-tempo to Up-tempo cuts are to me where she is better served. she has a interesting career. whatever she may lack vocally, she makes up for with her trademark stylings, though something about this package leave alot out&doesn't do her much justice. I still say that her 94 album ""My Life"" was Her Peak right there."
2,Could have been better!,This is a weak GH!!! Mary has had a lot more hits then what was included on this compilation package!!! They could have done a lot better and spent a little more time putting this GH together!!!
4,She Had A Breakthrough....,"Since I am a fan of Mary, I found this album to be wonderful. Basically, all you have to do is look at the track listing. These are songs that everybody has already heard so if you don't like the original songs, I advise you not to purchase this album. I think a few songs that should've been on there were missing, and some that were on there could have been left off, but all-in-all, I like this album and recommend it to all Mary J. fans!---Pryncez"
5,I loved this CD,I got this for Xmas and I haven't stopped playing it since I got it. This CD has some of her great songs that I loved. If you like Mary J. Blige then you will love this CD. I gave it 5 stars because I really enjoyed this CD cery much.
2,TOO MUCH LIKE ALL OTHER MARY J. BLIGE,"I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IN RETRO BUT, I ONLY GOT THREE SONGS THAT I CAN FEEL. THE OTHER'S ARE REMIX, SAME OH! I UNDERSTAND SHE WAS JUS' REFLECTING ON PAST. I SEE THIS ONE AS A COLLECTION JUST TO SAY ONE HAS. BUT, THIS WILL NOT BE MY LAST."
4,Very nice conglomeration,"I must admit this is the first Mary J disc I've bought since the 411. Nothing against Mary, but I thought her best work came from a depressed state of mind; I guess, sorta like the old blues singers. But Mary proved me wrong, this disc is excellent and she is feeling good about herself and her life. I didn't expect so many renditions of old songs, but I enjoyed them just the same. The new additions on this disc added a certain freshness (old & new kinda thing). She really deserved the Grammy. Makes me wonder how much i've missed between her first and last discs."
2,Great CD but missing tracks,"The long awaited and highly anticipated greatest hits collections has finally arrived. The one but very important criticism I have is why is the North American version 3 tracks short!! It's missing the key singles like the duet with George Michael ""As"" as well as the one with U2 and the coveted MJB Da MVP. I urge all fans to petition Geffen to release Mary's cds with their full tracklistings. After all, did she not gain international status from support here at home!"
1,Great artist but pathetic collection,"This is horrible! There are so many songs missing...this is truly a lost attempt at making what could have been a wonderful greatest hits album. Awful! Where on earth is ""You Remind Me,"" the song that made her famous? And where are ""Sweet Thing,"" ""Love No Limit"" and ""Reminisce,"" from her seminal CD ""What's the 411?"" Where is ""You Bring Me Joy"" from ""My Life""? Where are ""Everything,"" ""Seven Days"" and ""I Can Love You"" from ""Share My World""? There are no hits here from ""Mary""...no ""Deep Inside,"" ""All That I Can Say"" and ""Your Child."" ""Rainy Dayz"" and ""He Think I Don't Know"" are MIA from ""No More Drama,"" as are ""Love @ 1st Sight,"" ""Ooh,"" ""Not Tonight,"" ""You Don't Have To Worry,"" ""Give Me You""...and...worst of all...they included ""As,"" her duet with George Michael, ""One,"" her duet with U2, and ""MJB da MVP"" on the European edition of this album. WHAT IS UP????? These horrid record companies need to stop ripping us off once and for all. Shame shame shame."
2,Mrs. blige new cd off the mark,Mrs. Blige new 06 rel. is way off the mark & what Imean by that the songs are all wrong for her & this cd gets two stars thats all so does her 2005 cd rel as well wrong songs again. Lets here some love ballads or light smooth jazz songs would better suit her voice. Id pass her new release up or any other cd of hers til she puts out a smooth jazz cd or love ballad cd.
4,Good for your Kids,I bought this book out of curiousity used. ... So i figured i can't really loose. For Kids it can help them do something better with their time. It is a Great little book that shows them different creative ways to make animations. I would say for your kids. GO FOR IT. I will share it with mine (down the road when i have them.) Have a Fab Day...
3,not swiss made,I didnt know colibri had dumped swiss movements for china movements! beside that its not a bad watch for the price!
3,What was life like during the Phony War in 1939 in England?,"Mrs. Tim (from Mrs. Tim of the Regiment) is back. Her husband is in France, and Britain is slowly getting on a war footing. What adjustments does a civilian in a small town have to make? Life must ""carry on"". Read how Mrs. Tim helps her two children and her friends to carry on. Also, be introduced to a new friend, named Pinkie, who is a delightful creature. This story reminds us all that in spite of hardships and uncertainties, we all must ""carry on"". This is the second of four books."
3,Different Way of Telling the WWI Story of Waste,"Ellis doesn't produce anything new or different in terms of his evaluation of life in the trenches. The unique feature of the book is that it recounts history from the standpoint of the personal experience rather from the sequence of battles fought. The material is a review of much contained in the first person accounts of Sassoon, Graves, Barbusse and Junger. Eye Deep is a relatively short work but presents little new in view of the classic works of World War I. It might be a good explanation of the personal tragedy of the soldiers involved for a reader not very knowledgeable of the conditions encountered in the trenches of World War I."
4,Broadly Covered the Life in the Trenches,This book covers just about every aspect of life in the trenches. The first hand accounts that are used by the author tend to drive home the point or points he was writing about. The diagrams and pictures included in the book add value to the text. There is no way someone could really appreciate life in the trenches without the support of pictures and diagrams. This would not be a book to read if you have not read other books on WWI since the material covered is narrow and focused.
5,Gritty account of trench-life,"'Eye-deep in Hell' is an excellent, short view of life for the (principally British) soldier on the Western Front. The descriptions, pictures, and excerpts get the reader down into the grit of life in the trenches. I couldn't put it down!"
4,Postales desde el frente,"A pesar de no ser un lector angloparlante y dado que son pocos los libros sobre la 1ra Guerra Mundial editados en idioma español, tuve que poner el diccionario a mi lado y tratar de entender los numerosos giros idiomaticos que utiliza el texto, sobre todo cuando se trata de racontos de los propios protagonistas del combate.El libro esta muy bien presentado, los capitulos tratados en detalle y con una secuencia de fotografia que ilustran el coraje y el sufrimiento de los hombres en las trincheras.Me parecio sobre todo interesante la parte dedicada a la alimentacion de los hombres, las peripecias que tenian que hacer los equipos de busqueda de comida y la peligrosidad e importancia de su mision, que aqui no se ve soslayada.Ojala este libro sea traducido en algun momento al español, porque considero que todo estudioso del tema se vera favorecido y tendra acceso a una obra de notable valor."
4,Not A WW 1 Overview,"The book provides you want the title implies, a solders view of trench warfare. This was the first book I read about WW 1, and that was probably a mistake on my part. This book does not provide the reader with much of the background or political reasons of the war, but that is not the intent of the book. There is a lot of detail about what it was like to be a foot solder during both combat and off combat times. I would have liked more focus on all of the other countries solders in a comparison format. Overall a good book that reads fast."
3,Not as indepth as I would have preferred.,"I can't say that this book was memorable. It merely scratched the surface of a topic that is quite thick and interesting. ""Death's Men"" by Winters does a much more thorough and entertaining job with the subject."
5,Masterkicker,Hwang Jang Lee is a master Kicker. He is the best kung fu fighter in his town in this film. Don Wong is his name and kicking Butt is his game! LOL A must have! He gets plenty of screen time in this movie. In most of his movies he doesn't. But when he is on screen he steals the show
2,Really poor quality DVD ruins pretty good movie,"Since I am a old school kung fu enthusiast, I am used to grainy images and poor dubbing... however, this quality is very poor. Most of the movie is too dark to be seen and I had to adjust my screen to get a half decent picture. I really wish I could find a better copy because the story and fighting isn't half bad; its sad to see.My feeling is that this DVD should be in the $4.98 range - you can get much better movies out ther efor 10 bucks... go to ""Kung Fu for the Sole"" Listmania to find a few of my favorites."
5,Simply beautiful,"I love this earring, it is even more gorgeous than the picture. I bought it to wear to a wedding since I have the pendant to match. They are so rich together. Absolutely beautiful."
5,Quality fashion at an affordable price.,The earrings were exactly as pictured. I didn't expect the quality to be so good since the earrings were so affordable. I love wearing them! The dangles make me feel sassy and sexy!
4,My bird loves it but.....,Our bird loves this cd but it drive me crazy! The songs are very short. Yankee Doodle is the only song that has a full song. It is funny to hear our bird sing the star wars tune though.
2,FEATHERED PHONICS,I GUESS THIS CD JUST WASN'T WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I GUESS THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE.
5,God Speaks Spanish Too!!!,This is a great spanish New Testament devotional Bible.I got it for my my a few years ago and She has not put it down since!!! Each day devotional just happened to talk about what my mom was going through that day!!! It's like it was written just for her!!! You will really enjoy it!!! I know my mom did!!!TO GOD BE THE GLORY!!!
5,Sterling Silver Statue of Liberty Charm,"This charm arrived on time in a beautiful silver pouch. The quality of detail on such a small piece was better than expected. As it was a gift, the recipient was thrilled with it."
5,review for school,This book was a wonderful book about giving up what you love. I think that even children who don't like horses can enjoy this book.I will probably read other books in this series because I liked this book so much.
5,Great Collection of Political Stories,"A short book of some of the best campaign dirty tricks you will ever find. The author does a great job of ""warning"" readers that he doesn't recommend using any of the dirty tricks, but you just know he has done them all himself.Some of the best:There is a section on how to trip your opponent up in a debate.The fun you can have with negative push polls.And one of my favorites - find out if your opponent has reserved vans for a Get-out-the-vote effort and call and cancel their reservations. You could also use this trick with hotel or restaurant reservations or about a hundred other situation.All in all a great little book for the political junkie or anyone who enjoys a good jok"
5,A funny read,"It was a pretty funny book. I've been involved in a few local campaigns and this book describes a lot of what goes on in the trenches. If you like politics, you will like this book. It's that simple."
5,Excellent essays on modern science policy.,"This book contains essays by six well known scholars in science policy. Each examines some aspect of the famous Bush report (The Endless Frontier)as it relates to today's problems in science and technology. Bush's book is not idealized--some see flaws, omissions, and contradictions. A must-read (as they say) for those interested in federal science budgets and policy."
1,Did not stop blinking problem,"This product did not solve the blinking light problem with my Nintendo. Perhaps I am unlucky because other reviewers had success, but I would caution other potential purchasers to not get their hopes up."
4,My review.,"With this I can enjoy my NES for many years to come. It was a little troble some putting it together, but I managed."
2,"Works, but since its not made by nintendo the games have a hard time going in and out, but it still reads games","This after market 72 pin connector works, but hardly gets the job done. The games have to be pushed as hard as i can to make sure they are fully connected with the connector. & I have an even harder time getting the games out. Next time I'm going to spend the few extra dollars to ensure a quality connector."
2,rediculous!,product was in WORSE condition than the 72 pin connector i already had installed! and blanked just as bad. what a JOKE.
3,Nintendo Replacement 72 Pin Connector,"From the reviews, I understand that this fix works for some people, but replacing the connector did nothing for me. I still have to jostle the cartridges around a bit before they play correctly, exactly as I did before putting in the new connector. There was no noticeable difference. This is just a warning that even though it works for some, it may not be the instant fix that it's made out to be."
1,No Fix,It didn't fix the problem. I'm just glad that it didn't cost very much. It is one of those products that is purchase at your own risk.
5,BUY IT--seriously!,"My husband ordered this for me because I get so frustrated when we *try* to play my good ol' nintendo. It took us a few minutes to figure out the installation but WOW--totally worth it. We threw in like 5 games that never work and boom-there they were! Amazing. Do yourself a favor and stop blowing on the games (I tried to be tricky and blow cold then hot, ridiculous, I know) and get this thingamagig."
1,"this was cheap, in all ways","The connecter I had was really bad, so this helped a little,But it didn't make it so that it was worth spending the time it takes to get a game to work, in order to play it. So I guess I would say it wasn't worth buying it either."
1,didn't work,"I did everything right, but still didn't work. It might work for you, but it didn't work for me. Maybe I'm cursed by playing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
5,Pin Connector,It did what the seller said it would do and now i can play all of my games without having any trouble
1,Didn't do anything for me,"I decided to buy one of these the other day do to the abundance of positive reviews. I hooked it up today, and it isn't any better than before. In fact, I think my old 20+ year old pin connector works a little bit better than the brand new one. I don't know why I'm the only one that is having problems with it. I had my hopes up! Any suggestions? I thoroughly cleaned all of my games. I keep them in really good condition."
1,Sucky Pin Connecter,"I purchased this product , hoping that my beloved NES would be fixed. However, when I unscrewed the whole NES and finally managed to get the pin connecter in. When we turned on the NES the red light still blinked, and the game didn't work. I had varying results with different games, but in short they all didn't work. Also the company I purchased this from shipped it, but it ended up getting lost. I would definitely not recommend this product."
2,didnt work,"bought it to replace in my nitendo and it didnt work,screens still come up all fuzzy or flickers, wouldnt buy it again"
1,Did not work,"Not sure why, but it did not work as expected. Replaced an old connector with this one and it still did not work."
2,Low quality,"I've bought quite a few of these over the years, and it's probably impossible to tell which manufacturer each one was from. All I can tell you is that the one I bought associated with this listing wore out in less than a year, which is not acceptable. Not much choice than to just buy another one and hope it's a little better quality since this is a part they stopped producing decades ago."
5,Broken NES,"My Nintendo Entertainment System was not working, and it was because my 72 Pin connector was worn out, this part was quick and easy to replace, great replacement part!"
1,didn't work.,"Just didn't work...followed the directions and it just didn't work...oddly enough, I cleaned games with alcohol as the directions suggested....then put the old pin back in after the frustration and the games then worked with the old pin...apparently it was dirty games and not a bad pin...but the one i ordered didn't work!"
4,Revived a dead NES.,"Used this part on an NES that wouldn't play games, period. Every cart inserted would result in a blinking red light. Swapped it out, cleaned up the games (again) and that problem vanished entirely. It still takes a little bit of effort sometimes to get the games to properly load (often the image is garbled, I blame poor cartridge-seating design) but it does at least load the game, every single time.If I ever encounter another NES that needs fixing, I'll go straight for another one of these."
5,Blast from the Past,"5 Stars across the board. No question.They provided detailed instructions on installation on their site, and even mailed a written copy with the part.Delivery was speedy, installation was a snap. Just need a Philips Screw Driver.But results were fantastic!I was skepticalat first, I mean, the NES was one of my favorite systems, but it works. Put the game in, and play.Few things to know, however;The pins will be tight. So if you havea older NES cartridge with a thicker board, try not to use it for the first few times.Dont leave your games in your NES! they will wear down the tightness of your pins and then you have to repeat this all over again!During Installation, some things may be tight, or annoying to remove/apply. Dont get frustrated, jsut be gentle. Its most likely a 20 year old console, so its fragile.Kudos to the seller! Great find."
4,A great way to make your NES games play better,This 72 pin connector was recommended to me by a friend to fix the classic game glitches of the old school NES. It is a great way to restore a system to make it play like new. Keep in mind that you have to have clean games too though. It is normal for it to be harder to push in a game cause of the new part.
3,72 Pin NES Connector,"The connector made my NES run a bit better, but did not fix it 100%. I still must wiggle my cartridge around and pull it about half way out before i can get the game to start. I think this is because the connectors are not all the same, also there might be a difference in NES main boards.The customer service from LukieGames, however, was excellent. I called with a problem and they helped me out over the phone and sent me a replacement for free with no questions asked and great attitude. I will definitely be buying from LukieGames again. Great people."
1,cheap,"I've replaced 72 pin connectors before, these two worked the worst. still an occasional blink immediately after installing, and within a week, they are as bad as ever before replacing. Do yourself a favor and buy one that is higher quality."
2,The remedy is more expensive than the disease,"At first all great, but with the weather turn bad.This replacement is of poor quality, the pins are bent over time, being deformed, which makes some game does not work properly, the original is a better material, only with a clean enough.If you understand that the original is in worse conditions and cleaning is not enough, I recommend you not change it and use some cleaning liquid cash.You experience the replacement and truth is a bitter pill."
3,Lolita - Lite,"This is one of Nabokov's earlier books, published 22 years before Lolita. In many ways, the plot and feel of the two stories are quite similar (older man falls in love with younger girl who he idealizes, she doesn't love him but realizes her dependence on him, eventually ends in disaster). It's interesting to compare Nabokov's writing from one book to the other - Lolita is much more emotionallty intensive, challenging, has smoother and richer language, has more to say, and seems far less contrived than Laughter in the Dark. There's not so much to enjoy in Laughter outside of a pretty basic, well-written story. If you haven't read Lolita, buy an annotated copy and read that first, if you've already read it and are a fan of Nabokov's other works, definitely give it a shot, but with lowered expectations. A very good little book, just not a classic."
5,Beautiful,"Laughter in the Dark struck me hard. I loved it, I couldn't put it down, I found it moving and beautiful. My roommate didn't love it quite so much, but still found it captivating. This might not be a great book for a first-time Nabokov reader. It is far more subtle than Lolita or Invitation to a beheading. It might require a somewhat advanced love of his writing to appreciate it. However, if you are already in the club, Laughter in the Dark has some incredibly written scenes. Nabokov is incredible at using one line to create a massive picture; this book highlights that. The last chapter is somewhat anti-climactic though. I think this might actually be my favorite Nabokov so far."
4,Safety vs. Desire,"A fascinating journey toward darkness propelled by lustful aestheticism. To my amazement, there seem to be some echoes of Julien Green's 'The Dark Journey' in this book."
5,A masterpiece,"One of the greatest books I've read in my life,a page turner,unperdictable,highly readable,tragic,very funny,intelligent,great style of writing,nothing comes near it in perfection of storytelling simply nabokov"
3,Very well written 3.5 stars,"This is an extremely well written book, but not one of Nabokov's best -- a little too predictable, the main character unbelievably stupid about his mistress, as if Nabokov enjoys despising him. That can be amusing, but it detracts from the overall story -- hard to maintain that arch tone without boring the reader, even in a short book. Otherwise, somewhat dated and conventional, although told by a master. Pnin was more amusing, and Lolita more compelling. His collected stories is an excellent book."
5,The most convincing tale of obsession and betrayal I've ever,"Outisde of Lolita, not much Nabokov screams, ""Make this into a Hollywood movie!"" But Laughter in the Dark, with its chilling tale of obsession and betrayal, seduction and envelopment, is both so profoundly moving and such a fun read that I wish Brad, Gwynneth, and their pals would put this on the top of their wish list instead of the latest script to roll out of ICM. There is no word in English (and it was Nabokov's first foray into that language) to describe the sinister, spiderlike dance that brings our middle aged hero into a web of sex and intrigue which will cost him forever his family, job, and secure position in society. But we will all recognize the emotions that drive this man to submerge himself further in an illicit relationship -- even when he sees that he's drowning. Read it"
5,The best soap opera I have ever read,"I do not know if Nabokov meant this tightly written and wonderfully plotted noir to be a cautionary tale about adultery, but I do think that any married man who reads _Laughter in the Dark_ might think twice before starting an affair with a much younger woman. This book is a cross between _Lolita_, _Crime and Punishment_, with a sprinkling of ""Double Indemnity,"" and is quite simply the best soap opera I have ever read.Albert Albinus is a married, successful art critic who meets and falls in love with a young, attractive, but low class girl who is an aspiring, but no talent actress. She cuckolds Albinus with a colleague of his who is also a deceitful and amoral opportunist. Together they victimize Albinus in one of the cruelist and most sickening ways I have ever read. Albinus' foolish sin begins with and eventually ends in tragedy. If I may loosely quote Ford Maddox Ford's _The Good Soldier_, ""this is one of the saddest stories I have ever heard."""
5,Perfect Book for a Refresher or New Learner,"I'm not a newbie to blackjack, but it's been years since I sat at the table so I needed a refresher on the rules and also wanted to learn some other poker games that I am not familiar with. This book is well-written, concise, and learning the games for the first time or as a refresher was simple.I'd recommend this book to anyone with an interest in learning poker games, visiting casinos, or even participating in a friendly neighborhood game. Whether you ever play or not, it's always good knowledge to have."
4,Great cart but needs locking casters,"I got this cart at a decent price. It is durable and really easy to put together. My only complaint is, the cart should have come with at least one pair of locking caster"
5,great sturdy cart,"We use this in our kitchen to move heavy items around. works great for our needs! this is not a show piece like the $500 carts, but a great utility cart."
5,Excellent product,This cart is used on a concrete floor under heavy loads. It rolls very easily and is very sturdy. The top tray cleans easily.
4,Rubbermaid Cart,"Great cart, easy to clean. The only thing that bothers me is that it's a pull cart. They should have handles at both ends so when it's necessary to push you are able to."
3,"Cheeky, but not enough","An avid Cheek fan, I found this book thin in plot, and was disappointed the dog did not play a bigger role. On the other hand, it does capture in her inimitably hilarious way the life of a newly single mother with a self-absorbed ex-husband. And the episodes with the neighbor's rabbit were Cheek at her best. Read this, but not as your first exposure to this wonderful British novelist and brilliant comic writer who deserves wider exposure in the United States."
1,There's a Reason They're Unsigned,"An incredibly mediocre collection of wannabe's. Little original here. If you like indie bands, here's a few more. Face it, dear reader, there's a good reason that these bands aren't signed yet ... and it's got nothing to do with being undiscovered!Take your money & get to your local club. When you buy the local talent's CD, have them autograph it for you. It'll be far more satisfying, even if not any better."
4,Triple threat!,"Like a lot of animal-based Transformers, Scourge pretty much just rears back on his hind legs to transform. However, he has a decent amount of articulation, a wicked looking battle axe weapon, and those cool pop-out heads which work in dragon or robot mode. The necks actually have limited poseability to them, and Scourge's sound effects change depending on what form he's in for an overall total of three different sounds from the same buttons: roaring, lasers, and the famous transformation sound effect. The high-pitched dragon roar could get annoying for parents after a while, so you might want to figure out where the batteries are quickly."
4,SCOURGE ... THE EVIL ONE!,"I am a 6 year old boy. I got Scourge for my birthday last October. He is super powerful. He turns into a dragon. Scourge always frustrates me because his tail always falls off. Also, the different colored cyberkeys don't fit in him. You need to use only the Jungle Planet cyberkeys."
2,not worth it,"This looked bigger in the picture, and it's only about the size of a keychain, which is hardly worth anything, especially because it runs off those tiny and hard to find watch batteries, so not much power there. Realize how small it is before you buy it. I was highly disappointed."
3,these are ok,"The only problem I have with this is the glue. It is ridiculous. the applicator tips get clogged which is a given considering. But you end up getting gloued to yourself and your cat. Mines not agreeable at all so I have to fight with her the whole time. Ive taken to wrapping her in a blanket save for the paw I'm working on and this helps. The glue also gets on her fur and when the caps come off they end up taking a chunk of her fur too and its painful for her. I feel bad with how much it annoys and hurt her, but I figure it hurts a lot less than having her claws ripped out of her so i'll keep this up until it becomes too much...I'm going to try clear nail polish and see how that works"
2,Round One Ends in TKO,"Unfortunately, the third album by Principal Edwards Magic Theatre -- now reduced to just six members and therefore shortened to ""Principal Edwards"" -- shows very little of the inventiveness and musical unorthodoxy of their first and especially second.This album is pretty conventional, pretty unadventurous, and pretty unmemorable. Gone are all the influences from folk and world music, leaving only some generic FM rock in 4/4 beats and major scales. Nary a hummable tune on the whole disc.Competent; perhaps more-so than the first two (which may have reached farther than their grasp); but not improved by this provincialism."
4,Another english delight,"Principle Edwards is another englisg folk rock band.Their third album has it's ups and downs.The album has 8 pieces. Among them : ""Average Chap"", a very powerful beginning for the album,""Dear Mrs. O' Reilly - a delightful song, and a 10 minutes long prog piece - ""Rise of the glass - white gangster"".The album format is Japanese digipack format with a very high quality sound.Nick Mason, Pink Floyd's drummer, produced this album.The music is similar to bands like: Spirogyra, fuchsia, trees.It's very melodic and aldo very rocky at times.I like it try it."
3,Arggghhh! Where is all the decent writing?,"I bought Northern Lights, I struggled through Blue Dahlia, but this is getting close to ridiculous. Black Rose was interminable, boring, grating, and often mind-numbing. Did I make my point?Don't get me wrong; I love Nora Roberts, collect every book, read them all six or seven times. But, please, oh, please, someone help. The last three (mentioned before) have been horrible. I only perservered through Black Rose to follow Harper and Hayley, and that will be the only reason I will even think to buy Red Lily, which hopefully will be mildly redeeming.Other than that... If they keep coming out like this, I might have to put Nora Roberts on the shelf with Linda Howard, Jayne Ann Krentz, and Julie Garwood: their old books are wonderful, but I don't buy anything new."
4,Romantic and mysterious,"I am hoping for an encore after the third book of this trilogy.I am now hooked on Amelia and the whole gang of ghost hunters!!!The romance and fun of falling in love mixed with the wit and humor Nora Roberts gives to all her characters makes this book so enjoyable. If you love old houses like I do and the beauty of gardens, good men like Dr. Mitch and strong women then you'll love this second book in the Gardens trilogy."
4,Very Good,"Another of Nora's books that grabs you within the first 10 pages, but this book is a little slower than the Blue Dahlia."
3,Black Rose,This was not as good as the first written in the Garden Trilogy. I have not finished the Red Lily so will review when completed.
5,The best of Nora Roberts,"This is my favorite Nora Roberts book. I am an avid gardener, so the setting of the garden center, and details of the business was an added bonus. The characters in all her books seem real, but never more than in the In The Garden series. I love the balance of personalities, and their wonderful interaction. I felt as if I knew these people! When I started reading Black Rose it was like visiting old friends. Black Rose is my favorite, I think, because it is centered on Roz. She is such a strong woman, but does not let her strength take away from her warmth and femininity. I usually pass on my paperbacks to the library, but will not give away the In The Garden series. I have read them several times and enjoyed them each time!"
5,Witty Writing,I have read most of Nora Roberts books and in this series her witting writing really shines through. There are sections in the trilogy that actually had me laughing out loud. I highly recommend all three books in this trilogy
5,Black Rose by Nora Roberts,"This book was great! Even better than Blue Dahlia, it was more suspenseful and had more meaning. It showed that there is no age limit on finding love. It also sets up the next book well with Harper and Hayley seemingly starting to have feelings for each other. It's nice how these books just fall into place. It makes you think, what else could possibly happen, it is just so logical! I cannot wait for the last book in the trilogy, Red Lily, comes out!"
5,Loved this trilogy!,Once I started this trilogy I didnt want to put the books down and then when I got to the last one I didnt want it to end. I love Nora Roberts and this series was a great one!
5,Haunted Twist.......(Roz & Mitch),"Black Rose is a Great 2nd installment to this trilogy, Roz Harper is a Very Dignified and very Proud woman! who doesn't take any bull from anyone!"
3,not one of my favorites...,"okay so this is not one of my favorite series... and i have read almost all of her trilogies. I like though how she didn't do another 20-30 year old romance though and had a different kind of paranormal problem. But unlike her other books and series (key trilogy, Chesapeake bay trilogy, etc.) i just didn't want to keep reading it, for me there was no hook. so even though this book wasn't a hit for me i still hope to read more of her books."
4,The In The Garden Trilogy,"Nora's ""In The Garden"" Trilogy was great, but I must say not her best. Her characters are so life-like and you actually feel like you're part of the story. She's a phenomenal author and I have not come across anything of hers that I have not thoroughly enjoyed.I also highly recommend ""The Three Sisters Island Trilogy."" By far my favorite.Happy Reading!!"
3,BLACK KIND OF A DOWNER,"Believe me, I love Nora alot, but this book was dissappointing. She tried so hard to make Roz independent that she really comes off as a cold (...). She doesnt want friends, no one cluttering up her life ect. Of course it happens anyway, but this charactor is very unappealing. The love story comes off as unlikely- and What is this new theme running thru Nora's books? Where the female says, I want you in my bed, just so you know, and Ill tell yo when- jeez, wheres the romance in that?? I am afraid I like the old fashioned way, where the man is the aggressor, the female is swept off her feet, and there are problems and misunderstandings along the way.But hey, as I said, I love Nora and will always try her books. this one, tho, is stiff and unappealing."
5,This book has it all....,"This is the first time I've read a Nora Roberts book, This book has it all; mystery,love,heartache,pain,and passion. This book has a real sense to it. I love the charcters, David is an outspoken person who sounds like an amazing cook and friend , Harper, which is Roz son, he is to die for and Mitch, (roz boyfriend) you get to wonder ,you wished you were the females characters in this book. I think in the begininng it has a slow start but once you get into the middle of the book, it's has a fast pace plot and you won't be able to put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone and I can't wait till Red lily comes out in December, so when Christmas comes I know what I want in my stocking....."
5,....,Good read. Would recommend to friends. I like the story line and he way the book keeps me wanting to read more
4,Well- rounded ending,"I was hooked on this trilogy after reading the first of the series. I found the second book a bit forced, but really enjoyed the third and final installment. I hate to say goodbye to these characters and their enchanting home of Harper House. I was glad to learn the final resting place of Amelia and really enjoyed the ghost/haunting aspect of this romantic series."
1,loose sprockets on cassettes,"I was disappointed with my purchase. The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine. I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing. I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem. I wonder if these products were seconds or something? I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world."
4,Much Better than first book,Nora Roberts is such a prolific writer that about 1/4 of her books I am disappointed by. The first book in the series fell in that category. This was much better. I loved the older heroine and the hero had some serious growth. I liked the ghost getting more physical too. I can hardly wait for the next one.
3,decent but not her best.,"I normally love Nora Roberts, but this book seemed so predictable from the get go. In comes Sexy author Dr. Mitchell Carnegie and meets up with the tough Roz Harper. Together they continue the quest of the Harper Ghost. Maybe its because you know the story of the ghost from the start that spoils the small twists and turns. It just didn't have the twists and turns that I hope for in Nora's books. It wasn't bad, but I sincerely hope that with her final book Red Lily she ties it all together with a suspenseful red bow. I felt that she took the easy path of bringing the two characters together. Just not the terrific Nora Roberts style that I am accustomed to reading."
4,Great vacation read,"I read Blue Dahlia and Black Rose while on summer layoff, I could not put them down. Black Rose continues the story of Harper House, its inhabitants (living and not) and In The Garden, where they all work. Roz is pretty much the focus of this book, she is just a great character, she is definitely strong in most respects and the scene at the country club with her ex was one of the highlights. Not all of the loose ends were tied up and I can't wait for Red Lily to be published."
5,Great series,"Nora Roberts - Black Rose in the Garden Trilogy Great series. In the garden with the ghost, and love stories is great reading. It's fun to come to find what happen to the ghost and hoe they found her!"
1,Dodgy retailer,The shoes are a good product but I would not buy from this retailer again. I bought size 13'S and they were too small. I sent them back and never received a refund. They weren't interested in processing the refund.Such a pity as I had Flojo's before and they are awesome shoes.
3,Motley Tube,I love these things. I have mid length hair and I do not like to spend hours trying to untangle my hair after riding so I use these to not only keep my hair safe but to keep sweat and hair oils out of my helmet. And they look great too. Very confortable and easy to use. So many different ways to style them too.If you ride and your hair sticks out below your helmet these are a neccesity.This one and the blue one that are both solid color have lost shape and are now useless. Not too happy with them anymore.
4,Great biography!,"I've grown up with hearing, reading or watching re-tellings of the life of Saint Francis. He is, whether you can relate to him or not, one of the most fascinating saints in the history of the Church. If you look at the lives of various saints, one can see the many ways one is called by God to live a life of holiness, but always through obedience to Scripture and the Church. I've greatly enjoyed reading this and it has inspired me to have the boldness to live out the Faith and the calling God has made. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because this Kindle version of the biography (I do not know if all editions of this book are the same)have typing errors. But it hasn't kept me from enjoying this inside look on this poor beggar's life!"
3,Slipper review,"The slipper is well made but the ""wide"" is not all that wide and ends up being a little tight."
1,Took a chance cause they were cheap..,"I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap. I returned them, and I will avoid buying this brand again"
2,Drill bit,After drilling a few hole in some mild steel the bit started getting dull. I thought for sure this would do the job.Needless to say I was disappointed.
2,Twisted tale,"Amy goes from seeing her abusive father kill her mother with a hammer and into a foster home where she's being terrorized by the sociopathic son. The only thing she's got going for her is a special psi ability which helps her survive.This book has an interesting premise that's trapped in extremely long descriptions of things like a throw-away character's facial hair, wallpaper patterns, and other mundane details that drag the story down. The shrinks constantly making Amy out to be some kind of monster when she's the victim gets old fast, especially when there is justice for abusive jerks and anti-social pervs being dealt out as appropriate.Overly long, poorly paced, Amy Girl is the sort of book you read when there's nothing else around."
4,don't read at night alone,A girls mom dies than she somehow kills her dad than she inherits her grandmas house and.... Read to find out wat happens and what happens to herAND I AM 13 YRS OLD BY THE WAY
4,Decent value for second drill,"Not a Dewalt by any standard...but OK for a home owner..radio..well i've seen better..but it works and what do you want for under 30 bucks..the drill is decent..has only two speeds..wish it had variable slow speed, but them a drill and radio for under $30.00..go for it the price is right I am glad I picked it up...still have my DeWalt, but this is good for a second drill.."
1,Awful,So glad I checked this book out from the library instead of buying it. I couldn't believe how self-important and unlikable the tone of the book was. The author seems to think she is personally responsible for everything that has happened in knitting in the past 20 years. I love books and knitting and was just horrified by this one.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one book that won't be added to my extensive knitting library and I'm sorry I wasted my money to find that out. As other reviewers have noted, the patterns are most unattractive and the name dropping is extremely annoying. Who cares about second rate actresses anyway? Ms. Eig may run a fine shop, but she did not invent knitting,or knitting baby showers, as she seems to think. Save your money for Sally Melville's excellent knitting series."
1,Don't spend the money....,"Check it out of the library if you really want to look thru it. The author comes off as self-important and obnoxious. She is almost sure no one would have learned how to knit if it weren't for her and that she has the only yarn shop to carry good quality stock. I expected the name dropping, it is in Hollywood and all, but she goes on and on. She takes credit as the very first person to ever have a baby blanket making shower---that's been going on for years and that same concept is what is used for the Linus project and any other number of charity groups. The patterns are kind of on the unattractive side but I did like the cashmere wrap, that is cute. I wonder who her editor was because that person did not do Edith any favors."
1,You Are Not Missing Anything,"This book does not teach you any thing that any good knitting book has not already said.This woman is so full of herself, she thinks she is God's gift to the knitting universe. The name-dropping was unbelievable even by Hollywood standards. I got this book through the library, I would not have paid a penny for this book. The patterns are so unimaginable, I have seen better designs in ""how to knit"" leaflets."
3,Mother of Purl,I received this item in a timely manner in great condition. I thought it would have more children's patterns. there were many hints given in the book that I thought interesting and helpful even to an experienced knitter as I am.
1,Ugliest Patterns EVER,"I do NOT recommend this book. The beginning is great for beginner knitters, but the patterns--YUCK! What HORRIBLE yarn selection! And the patterns...atrocious!"
2,Poor pattern construction,"Although the ""how-to"" portion of the book is pretty good, the patterns themselves are not good at all. I am currently almost done with one of the jackets in the book, and find that she does not give directions for joining the pieces! I can figure it out from other patterns in the book, but I was expecting better."
1,Impossible directions,"Found most directions wanting, page 107 a hat knit on circular needle would be impossible to complete with the decreases called for."
2,not really what I expected,"I thought it would be nice to read a mixture of a glossy and a knitting book, but I'm a little disappointed about the book. the patterns are dull and the instructions are not different from any other 'how to book'. not much about the stars too, more about the auteur. take knitting without tears from e. zimmermann if you want a great book , or the sweater workshop for knitting in the round, much better!"
5,This is a must for all knitters!,"I have shopped at Edith's yarn paradise for years. She takes time for all customers. Edith is a master knitter who shares her wealth of knowledge with all who graces her shop door. ""Mother of Purl"" carries through with this vast amount of knowledge for all who cannot grace her shop. She is a task master but in the end you have teacher, friend and beautiful knitted project. Every knitter whether beginner or advanced needs to own this book. It takes you from the basics that all need to know to the advanced. Great designs that take you from being a beginner to advanced designs. This is a must to own!"
5,Fun and Fabulous!!!,"Love it -- I have yet to buy any other knitting book that offers such valuable knit tips as Edith Eig presents in this really terrific knitting book. The patterns are fun and fabulous -- just like the title says -- and Edith really designed something to appeal to everyone! Unique, entertaining, well written and inspiring! I recommend this one."
5,Great tires..,I'm using these as beefy road/trail tires on my Surly CrossCheck and I am very happy so far.They roll nice and fast/smooth on road but have enough grip for all the singletrack I've hit. Nice and fat.
3,General Use Road Tire,"Good all around tire for a Hybrid application such as Trek 700. Good tread for road, cindered, packed dirt trails. Not enough tread for mountain trail use."
5,mom loved this,Mom is pretty picky about robes so I was a bit hesitant about getting something like this online. Turned out i should not have worried. She loved it. (it was a bit expensive though.)
1,Warning! --- Avoid Like the Plague --- A Health Hazzard!,"Vendor, National, should pull this item immediately due to unbelievable amount of shedding --- not just bits of chenille that fall off on floor/carpet (as if you are Gretel leaving a path:-), but also a huge amount of finer fuzz that coats your bed, and upholstery, etc. Worst of all however is the incredible amount of air-born particulate matter --- I have developed chest congestion/bronchitis after wearing for 1 week in spite of 3 washings --- never suffered from any lung/chest condition before, even though I am a ""senior."" More details to come (have photos) after I contact manufacturer, but in the meantime wanted to warn my fellow Amazon customers of the serious danger to health from inhalation --- not to mention the clean-up of my previously immaculate house (hours of vacuuming, dusting, upholstery brushing as it went ""viral"" )."
4,soft bathrobe,"This bathrobe is shorter than it looks in the photo. My mother is 5'6 and it came to mid calf. I had to return it because she thought it was longer. However it is a very pretty color and soft, and nicely made."
3,Bland,"Although informative, this book is bland. It's hard to get through more than a couple of chapters at a time. In fact, I skipped some altogether (although I later tried to re-read it with the same results). I found the first part of the book (especially the Jamie Bulger case) a lot more interesting than the second half."
5,"hypnotic, classic harmonized soulified version of Kraftwerk","This is electro at its very best.......hynotic, compelling, yet with harmony. Produced by the great Arthur Baker.....and an amazing follow up to the incredible Planet Rock. Now, has anyone got a clue where one could find Baker's Funky Soul Makossa which is another old electro classic that cant be found anywhere.....also a clone called We've Got the Juice by Attitude. This Planet Patrol number is the among the very best though. buy it while its still being issued."
2,Be cautious this Book is Great...But NOT for everyone!,"While the concept is cute for little children...for example someone was rude to them at school. Or someone did some other kind of bullying behavior...it's a ""cute idea"" to see it this way! So they will just shrug it off...and think I want to be a Light of Good!HOWEVER....to me if someone was to Give/Read this book to any child and most likely any adult....that had been Severely Abused....I think it would be ""SLAP"" in the face....Someone who has been abused be it emotionally, sexually or physically! Or another example someone has been raped or beaten by a spouse!Yes you should forgive....because it helps you personally to forgive....but lets not make the victim suffer more! ***By making excuses for Very Bad Behavior!Therefore I would not recommend this book to Everyone!"
1,I'm not so sure the 8 yr old can get into this...,"I love NDW & CWG, as I've read & listened with the highest interest & enjoyment & am thrilled with the enlightenment I've received from them. As for this book, which I bot & am giving to my grandaughter for her B/D today , I read it myself and I'm not so sure she is going to understand it. I also bot the other book (....Earth), & decided not to give that one to her. I'll read it & give it to her sister on her B/D this coming spring. I'm dissapointed in the book, as I thot NDW would have found a much more easier & enjoyable way of expressing his message to children. As I said I'm disappointed & am not sure my daughter will let her read it, but after the expense of the purchases, I don't want the hassle of sending them back."
2,Too complex for young minds,"This is a lovely book. Walsch has set out, as he has in all his other books, to bring love, peace and understanding to the world. Unfortunately this is not his greatest success. Two types of children will get this book - those whose parents are CWG fans and can explain the book to their children, and those who receive this book from someone outside the immediate family as a gesture of love. The latter group are the losers because the book needs explaining. The topic of ""slowing down vibrations and becoming heavy"" is something that some CWG readers cannot grasp so what chance the children? I think Walsch has made a good attempt to bring CWG to children but it could have been so much simpler than this. You have to aim at your audience and I think he should have imagined a kid picking up this book and understanding it first time round with no assistance from outside. He would then have tackled it a different way."
5,No Need to Forgive,"Once I began to truly understand that everything that happens in life is consciousness, it became clear to me that 'there was no one but me."" and that my life was a reflection of my thoughts, beliefs and feelings. This book says it better than any sermon or book I've read in a long time. Yes, it's a story for children, but much like the Velveteen Rabbit, it will become a classic for adults as well.A must read - and worth pondering.[...]"
5,Loved the book and want others like it!,"As with all of Walsch's books, this one touched me and gave me great insight into the workings of life. I would like to hear from other readers: - What other children's books have you found with this type of message? - What would you like to see in other children's books on spirituality?My name is Blair. You can e-mail me at ParentsGuide@hotmail.com"
3,Good read for older children,"I got this book for my 5 year old daughter. Before reading it to her, I read it myself and soon realized it was not for her age group. Don't get me wrong, it is a good book with a good message. It's just not a book that younger children will be able to comprehend."
2,"Don't agree. Highly recommended, thou!","I liked this book from the first pages, but...I don't agree with the idea, that ""evil"" is natural, which seems to be the a backthought of this book.As someone told in his review:""Now I understand my choice better"", but if you choose EVIL - it wont make You any better!The book for adults."
2,God and Darkness?,"I love the adult books and looked forward to one for kids.The book idea of a soul that choices to be born is great and the idea that God creates light works for me but needs explaining. I have a problem with the idea that if God only creates light how does he create darkness with another light so the first light can get a sense of how it feels in comparison? That does not work for me or our Church. We believe that man, not God, by our free choices, creates darkness and that God creates light and good and wants only that for us but does not create the darkness.Blessings!"
1,Jessica Lunsford buried alive ...,"... and according to this book, she and her family were done a favor, by someone who went out of their way to be, against their true nature, evil - so that others could forgive them for their atrocities.That is the message of this book, like it or not.Those who like it have probably not been done the great favor."
5,I am the Light...,"This is another great book by Neale. This is not just a kid's book, every adult should read this. It remines me that I always have a ""choice"". Thank you Neale."
4,Cris is timeless..,"Chris Montez is still going strong and performing. He is just as great today as he was yesterday and his music is timeless. This compilation is a cross section of some of his most popular hits, but also includes many other standards and ballads who for his age at the time of recording were a comfortable stretch for him.I have seen Chris two times in the last couple of years and I am never disappointed in the performance or deliverance of his music.He is in the process of making a movie about his life and I cannot wait to see it."
3,Chris Montez CD,"What can I say? Either you love the guy, or hate him. This CD has his most popular A&M recordings, and some that were not often heard. If Chris Montez is your singer, this CD works!"
5,Great CD!,"I purchased this because I couldn't get the ""good"" Chris Montez's songs individually on either iTunes or Amazon MP3 downloads. The CD came quickly and definitely was brand new. I've been enjoying it since!"
4,Good Stuff!,"I've been waiting for Chris's A & M hits to come out on CD for years.Even though he may not have had the greatest voice in the world, he had good material and style. I'm glad Herb Alpert was able to persuade him to change his style from rock and roll to the soft smooth sounds that he became so noted for. As is the case with most of these anthology themed CDs, this is an import."
5,Excellent music for guided imagery,"I have been using this music for guided imagery, relaxation and visualiztion for over a year. It is beautiful and relaxing music. Very conducive to imagery."
5,The color photos are lavish and display many styles,Libraries with strong sections on ethnic or modern architecture will want to include Bibi Jordan's Safari Chic as a unique presentation of over a hundred photos of exotic exteriors and interiors. African bush style goes modern in homes which profile decorating choices achieved through ethnic crafts and fabrics. The color photos are lavish and display many options and styles.
5,The BEST book on GroupWise!,I purchased this book after comparing it to the Novell book. I am glad I bought this book as it is very detailed and informative. There are good examples and illustrations. The authors definitely know what they are talking about!
5,Fascinating,"A combination of hundreds of studies, insights from the work of scholars across several fields, clinical experiences and observations culled from literature across the ages makes for a fascinating, and helpful, journey into discovering what makes us fall in love with people. Reading this book was a liberating experience. The recommendations at the end of each chapter are quite amusing because of the way that they are worded."
3,Just a Tease,"If you're looking for more erotic pleasure, this DVD isn't for you. But, if you're looking for a virtual lap dance without paying the high bucks and driving to a club, this is for you. This is one of a kind in quality. The picture doesn't look like it was burned from vhs to DVD, or poor quality shooting. The angles I think is what sells this DVD. It is pretty cool to go from one to the other. My choice of three stars is because this wasn't what I was expecting."
5,5 Star Book,"There is not much I can add to the other reviews. I couldn't put it down either and spent the whole day reading until my eyes gave out. Bernard F. Connors can really write. Major Call, the poetry loving desperado was an almost likable fellow, but as usual, ""there was something about him."" And God help the person who got in his way. A dedicated military and family man, he couldn't control his rages or his weakness for dangerous situations, fast cars, and stealing. He may very well have been the mysterious bushy haired stranger seen in the Bay Village neighborhood where Marilyn Sheppard was murdered in the 50's. Did he kill her? Read the book and decide for yourself. I went back and re-read parts of the story and studied the haunting photos. There are also documents and additonal photos in the back of the book. This is one you will want to own."
5,This is what a dance song should be like!!!!,"As a gay male, I must admit that I'm not a big fan of dance music because it all sounds so repetitive. I heard this song and all I have to say is WOW!!! This is what a dance song should sound like and kudos goes to Shapeshifters for sampling one of the greatest R & B treasures from the legendary Johnnie Taylor ""What About My Love"". Sampling I also must admit is overdone, but this is the rare case where it works perfectly!!! One of the best dance songs ever. It's a song where you instantly fall in love with it when you first hear and it stays on your mind after it goes off."
1,Song Lola's Theme,"This 2008 re edit is terrible! If youlet someone hear it BEFORE buying it, they WOULD NOT!!! Save your money and read This review first. Teh butchered version for salr here is like throwing your money to the wind!!"
4,Fine albums from underrated singer,"Julius La Rosa is far more than a 50s pop footnote. He was at his vocal peak when recording these two Roulette albums (after three hitless years on RCA, which sadly seemed to saddle him with the novelties that Como turned down). On ""Love Songs,"" he sings with remarkable passion and strength - his version of ""How About Me"" must rank among the all-time best versions of that song, which can be taken to maudlin extremes (even Garland overdid it- here it's just perfect). ""Sunny Side"" is just that, a marvelous collection of uptempo standards. If you like Sinatra or Darin, it's time to discover La Rosa!"
5,LaRosa at his peak...,"If you love great interpreters of the Great American Songbook, you owe it to yourself to grab this pairing of two fine albums from Julius LaRosa. Arguably, his talents were reaching their peak in this early-60s period; with ten years of experience behind him, both his voice and his phrasing were reaching full maturity. His infectious enthusiam on the ""Sunny Side"" album is particularly delightful."
5,LaRosa Never Better,This CD Of Julius LaRosa is Made Up From 2 LPs//And I Was very Happy To Buy It Because I've Worn Out My Lps//Out Of All The Songs On This CD//The One Song That Really KnocksMe Out Irving Berlins HOW ABOUT ME//In My Opinion HOW ABOUT ME has To Be The Best Record That Mr.LaRosa Has Ever Made//If You Listen closely You'll Hear The Most Wonderful Rendition Of This Song//In All Myyears Of Listening To Julius LaRosa I Think That Most People Think Of Him As An Italiansinger Of Novelty Songs//But I Think He has Been Very Under Estimated and If You Listen To HOW ABOUT ME About 6 or 7 Times In A Row//You'll See And Hear What I Mean/HOW ABOUT ME is The Best Record (In My Opinion) That Mr.LaRosa Has Ever Made//So Listen And I Think That You Will AgreeStanley Cooper Jupiter Floridazoundz@bellsouth.net
4,A fine product.,"Having listened to this player using my Sennheiser 433 headphones, I found the volume to be perfectly ample. I am very satisfied with this product."
3,What a waste of time.,"This was one strange documentary (if one can call it ""documentation""--after all, what is being 'documented'). This documentary seemed as though it was placed together by an unskilled editor, but even worse is the torture of sitting through the entire DVD. While watching this DVD, I thought it could have been condensed into a five-minute YouTube video explaining this strange pursuit of visiting every Starbucks in the world. After a few minutes, I started to get bored, wondering what the fascination was in visiting a store which is truly exactly like every other store. I can understand, for instance, wanting to visit each Disneyland on earth because each theme park is, to some extent, different. However, visiting every Starbucks in the country (and the world?) What a waste of time."
1,quality of the VHS tape,I have purchased the used version and it is horrible. I am not able to watch because it is in bad condition. Who ever sold it - shame on you. Irene K
3,For hardcore fans only,"As much as I love Weezer and wanted to like this album, I have to say this CD is lacking in quality. While it is always fun for me to listen to Weezer's live songs it may not be as fun for the casual listener when they forget the words to amazing songs like El Scorcho. The CD cover is cute as hell, though. Inside you can also find comments by Japanese fans in their best attempted English. That to me was cool enough to justify the price I paid for this CD."
4,Rare Stuff,"Wicked cool CD for a hardcore Weez fan. 6 versions of songs that you won't hear anywhere else, but elongated jams that sound really good. Recommended for those that love the Weez."
1,Great Live band but cheap product,Weezer could have put out a full live album. Instead you get some pasted songs put together and the end is clipped off. 100% not worth buying unless your a die hard fan like me. I love weezer but they need to put out a full live album. Packaging is cool though.
1,"""Forever""","In answer to Jennys question, ""Damage"" is the group that sings the song ""I'll be lovin you forever."" Hoped I helped your never- ending search for the song."

You need to go to lyrics.astraweb.com and in the search engine type in Damage and it will give you a list and the song is there. I hope this helps."
3,SONGS MISSING FROM THIS SOUNDTRACK,"I really enjoyed the movie ""BAPS"" and I think the moral to this story is ""Dreams never die - people do. Believe and you will achieve"". Like one customer said in her review, songs are missing from the soundtrack that were plyed in the movie, like ""Can't Wait"" by Robin S. If anyone knows where I can get that song I would be forever grateful for this."
2,disappointed,"The songs that were said to be on this CD were not on it. I read the credits at the end of the movie, and the one song that I really liked was not on this CD. That song is ""Your Love Is Shining Down On Me"" What happened to this song?"
3,Robin S,"The Song people are talking about and want is by Robin S,The song is called let your love shine down on me.It was not released on the soundtrack and she never released the single on anything else,It was one song that was really good and got lost and never made to buy or get anywhere."
1,I was cheated!,"I thought I was getting the Soundtrack with the music listed on the description page. Instead, I received another CD with the soundtrack ""SCORE"". All instrumental music and none of which I was looking for. I wasted my money and I hope this seller realized what they did to me and how disappointed I am."
1,YOUR LOVE IS SHINING DOWN ON ME,"THIS CD WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BECAUSE I WANTED IT FOR THE SONG ""YOUR LOVE IS SHINING DOWN ON ME"" IF ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND THIS SONG. PLEASE POST!...THANKS!"
1,"""Forever""","In answer to Jennys question, ""Kai"" is the group that sings the song ""I'll be lovin you forever."" Hoped I helped your never ending search for the song."
4,Rough Time in Hollywood,A lot of infromation on the trials Miss Tierney went through coping with the whole Hollywood situation. A good addtition to my collection of books about older Hollywood actors.
3,Mixed emotions,"I bought this book because I have become a huge fan of Ms. Tierney's films. I was curious about her life and movie career. I read most of the book with a puzzled look on my face and feeling several moments of deja vu because she repeated thoughts and memories over and over and would jump from subject to subject without rhyme or reason. I would read some paragraphs over just to try and make sense of the whole thing. I do think she was intelligent and a loving mother, which I think the birth of her handicapped child literally drove her insane. My final thoughts of the book as I finished were feelings of sadness for her and truly wishing I did not know about her the things I had read because now I will watch her films through different eyes."
5,An Insightful Autobiography,"Called the most beautiful woman in movie history by Darryl Zanuck (founder of 20th Century Fox), actress Gene Tierney also proves herself a good and insightful writer with this accomplished ""self-portrait"". I purchased this on a whim in an antique store, and have read it several times. I appreciate her honesty regarded her psychological problems and the fun tidbits about Hollywood life in the 1940s. It's unfortunate that the name Gene Tierney is so unfamiliar these days. She was a talented actress and writer, and I enjoy her work very much."
5,"Gene Tierney, a revelation","Excellent! Seems honest and revealing. Great insight into one of my fave stars. Tierney was elegant, breathtaking in LAURA, beautiful and demonic in LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN. I think she's under-appreciated now. Unfortunately, Tierney's life was rife with sorrow and bouts with mental illness. This book seems like an unvarnished, sensitive account of that life. Highly recommended for film buffs and faithful fans of TCM."
4,Not as good as Stings,its to bad that the Sting video came out first becuase it is going to be hard to compete with it in the future. this is a good video if you only care about the last to years of his career. I on the other hand wanted to see atleast a little of the old page who was heavier and had the cigar and gum at the same time. Plus he needed to be out of character more like sting was but the matches that are given are good
1,Useless,"This windshield produced buffeting that shook my helmet so badly my eyes couldn't focus on anything. Powersport Superstore wouldn't allow me to return it because I had opened the box (how else would I have known about the buffeting). They closed my request with the comment ""Solved a technical issue"" before ever contacting me.Shame on me for not reading Powersport Superstore's return policy before ordering. Shame on Slipstreamer for selling this windshield as compatible with my bike (Virago 750) when it is not. (There is more to compatibility than just being able to mount it on the handlebars.) Shame on Powersport Superstore for closing out my return request with that ""Solved a technical issue"" comment. No technical issue was ever solved.An unhappy experience all the way around."
3,unsatisfied costomer,we recently purchased a windshield for my dads bike that came with all the hardware for his specific app. The fork brackets are not even close! The only thing i can do is take it off the bike and send it back or contact the manufacturer but there is no phone number to call anywhere on this website.Not very convenient.The windshield itself is fine not satisfied with the hardware or the costomer service end of things.
2,lacks quality,"Watch is fascinating, but executed poorly.Arrived in a broken case (cheaply made), and had unremovable glue marks around glass edges."
1,"not a bad idea, but...","Ruth Copeland was in an early incarnation of Parlement, and in turn, Funkadelic backed her up on a lot of her solo work, on this set.This sounds good, but a lot of these tracks are ballads which are just not that interesting--well played, but way under Clinton and company's capabilities. Other tracks rock hard, but Copeland's voice is not strong, and it sounds like she is reaching way beyond HER capabilities. On one hard funk number, Copeland fakes an orgasam and, and even this falls flat.She is earnest and her efforts genuine, but her music just doesn't work"
4,A great introduction,"This book provides an easily readable introduction to Voice over IP. It assumes little prior knowledge of the reader on the subject, and provides a particularly good introduction to the Internet Protocol, before launching into the specific details of transporting voice over IP.A broad range of subject matter is covered, although the sections on implementation and Quality of Service are a little weak. Nevertheless, many sources of further research are offered.Written in a clear and unassuming style, we recommend this book highly."
5,THE BEST,"This CD is a life-saver. It is MUCH better than several that I previewed. Sometimes I put it on for hours just to unwind. Especially good on stressful days. Very realistic, but no seagulls."
3,"Okay, but ocean too mild","This recording was lacking in several ways. If you like big crashing waves, this one does not deliver, as most are gentle to medium waves that end peacefully against a sandy beach followed by sounds of water trickling. The sounds are a bit disproportionate with the waves somewhat muted and the ""trickle"" sounds much louder than you would expect. The wave pattern seemed too rhythmic and unnatural to me, as though I were listing to one wave at a time with a pause between each rather than a recording of the ocean. And lastly, there was just too little variation (I know that can be a good thing, but was taken too far on this cd).I have a few of these ocean sound cds as I have found they are perfect for listening at work. They are soothing but do not interrupt my train of thought. So far my favorite is Echoes of Nature: Ocean Waves (I'll review it on its amazon page).There are so many variations of ocean sounds in the world, why hasn't someone developed a 4-cd set of ocean sounds?"
5,Peaceful,"I purchased this CD-ROM about 7 years ago and played it every night. I listened to it until I fell asleep. I have listened to it each night since I purchased it. The constant playing resulted in numerous scratches on the back. Several weeks ago I had the CD restored so that I could continue enjoying it. I have often looked for this CD so that I could purchase another copy since my original one was becoming well used. I am thrilled to find it again so that I can have a new copy and a constant supply from now on when replacement becomes necessary. It is the most relaxing and soothing sounds that I have ever heard. Additionally, I find it envaluable for daytime listening whenever I am in need of some peaceful downtime. While I have found other environmental sounds CD's, none of them compares to this CD-ROM. It is worth the money. Your well-being will be enhanced."
3,Annoying rocks,The sound of the surf is what I was looking for but the added trickle of the water movement amound the tide pools is not restful in fact they are down right annoying.
3,Gets on your nerves,"I don't know what it is about surf CD's. When we go to Hawaii we always rent a house right on the ocean and we sleep to the sounds of the surf all night. For some reason, any CD of the surf we've bought gets after your nerves after about five minutes and is no longer relaxing. It's almost as if they record a minute or two of surf and just keep repeating it over and over. This one was better than most, but it still annoys us after a while."
3,Dan Gibson Ocean Surf,"Dan Gibson, may he rest in peace, made a recording of the ocean that is very accurate (Ocean Surf). But he was obviously fascinated by any and all sounds that were there to be recorded .There's only about 17 minutes of Ocean Surf that is actually from the perspective of someone listening to the ocean (what they would actually hear) the rest of the CD is filled with the sloshing and splashing of water around tidepools and on rocks that you wouldn't hear unless you had highly directional ears and amplified hearing.This is less than soothing, between waves these sounds that make you check to see if the kitchen sink isn't overflowing ! ! !"
3,"great first cd, not so great second cd.","The Little Mermaid is my absolute favorite Disney movie of all time. But lately I've become very disappointed because Disney insists on including music videos in a lot of the rereleases of classics with some random Disney Channel actor singing the songs. I understand that a lot of songs out now are remakes, but these are just bad except for Jessica Simpson's version of ""Part of Your World"", but Ashley Tisdale's version of ""kiss the girl"" is annoying."
5,Loved it then. Loved it now.,"Little Mermaid was the first video I ever owned myself. Loved it from the first day I saw it. I don't hold the same view as I did as a child but it's still a wonderful story. And the music is just plain fun. The best part of this special edition is Ashley Tisdale's rendition of Kiss The Girl. Let me start by saying I have issues about Disney's need to turn every actor into a singer and every singer into an actor and the promote them to the ends of the earth. And it's not so much Ashley Tisdale - though she's very talented - that makes me love this version of the song. Whoever revised the arrangement is who I'd like to really thank. I love every thing about how this version was put together. Upbeat. Fun. Totally ""sqeeable"". But then I'm a hopeless romantic."
5,The Little Mermaid,"I have seen this movie before and I loved it, this was a present for my daughter. The quality was great."
3,Nice but still slightly annoyed,"I love the music but I didn't want to have to buy the whole album for the one track I wanted...really for me it was a slight waste cause I have the broadway soundtrack on my mp3. The track I wanted was ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" by the Jonas Brothers."
3,"Great Music, Bad Audio","This is without a doubt one of the best movie soundtracks ever. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were magical together, with Menken's powerful score and Ashman's use of music to build the story and insight of its characters. Unfortunately, the audio on the mp3 version I purchased is low and muffled. The cassette I bought in the 90's actually sounds better."
4,Don't underestimate the importance of body language.,"The Little Mermaidwas the film that revitalized the animation division of Disney. The great songs in the movie by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken were at least partially responsible for the film's success. Wonderful songs like ""Part of Your World"", ""Under the Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"". But, unfortunately, there aren't enough songs to fill up an entire album, so the second half of the CD consists of the instrumental score. It's a good score, certainly, but it's not as enjoyable to listen to as the songs. But fans of the film should get this CD, anyway."
3,Very cute!,"The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie when I was a little kid, and I LOVE the music! My fave song has to be ""Part of That World"", but ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Under the Sea"" are cute, too. Even if you haven't seen the movie or don't care for it, you should get this CD. It's great for all ages!"
3,Mermaid Masterpiece,"I have not listened or opened it, since I ordered it as a birthday present for my cousins, but I know The Little Mermaid enough to understand why it was such a hit. The music is fairly interesting for me, and Poor Unfortunate Souls really describes Ursula's plot and actions well. I like how that song starts off dark and low, then progresses more tense, just like in The Lion King's ""Be Prepared."""
2,"Great Originals, Remake by Jonas Brothers unfortunate...","Ive always loved the Little Mermaid and was excited to see this set, but I have to say I was disappointed to hear the Jonas Brothers singing Poor Unfortunate Souls. When Ursula sings this song kids know she's one of the ""bad guys"" but its a strange message that daughters and their friends get when the hottest boy band out today is singing about girls needing to basically shut up and be pretty to get a man. Stick with the originals and skip disc 2."
5,Resonates with those who've served.,"Anyone who's been throough basic training will be touched by Heinlein's intelligent and thoughtful treatment of a classic coming-of-age theme, as will those who searched as a teen without knowing waht they were looking for. Heinlein's classic page-turning style will engage and challenge the reader on the import of every subject from historical ethecs to mathematics. Take a poingant and insightful look into the heart of a soldier and come away with a new understanding of what it means to serve."
2,"Should've been called ""starship bootcamp""","Very boring for a ""classic"". The book opens with a hasty battle scene, then is really just about a generic, boring character in bootcamp. Heinlein preaches a lot, and while it's interesting, it gets stale quick. After bootcamp the main character decides to become an officer, and the rest of the book is just really about that. If you have some kind of affinity for reading about people in bootcamp, pick up this book. If you wanted to read about a starship trooper, expecting the war to be anything else than a reason to be in bootcamp, look elsewhere."
3,Interesting,Though I agree with most of his views on how the world should be run this book was a little dry. I read this book primarily for his insights into future society. I must agree with most of what he said. When he wasnt waxing philosophical the book tended to drag. I would like to know how the movie and book are related besides the title?
4,Great military book,While being science fiction this novel was really more a military story that just happened to be in the future. Really more intelligent than the crappy movie that shares the same name. Great story and really a quick read that is quite enjoyable.
3,"A classic, but the edition is not as described.","The book is one I've wanted a hardcover edition of, for a long time.I ordered a ""Library Binding"" and received a cardboard cover on a paperback edition."
4,A very challenging and rewarding read,"Although it is very different to the recent film, Robert A. Heinlein's classic sci-fi novel is just as enjoyable, albeit in another sense of the word. It is less action-orientated than the film, and concentrates more on the metaphorical and theoretical elements of warfare. The main characters, especially Johnny Rico, are developed to a greater extent, and are not as stereotyped as they are in Verhoeven's film. There is a tendency for the philosophical aspects of the book to become waffly, which dissuades me from giving it 5 stars, but overall, 'Starship Troopers' is close to achieving the status of 'compulsory reading' for any sci-fi fan."
2,"Great book, poorly read","This book is my all time favorite Sci-fi book. I have re-read it several times. I was excited to find it on inunabridged audio cassette format.Unfortunatly, who ever hired Lloyd James to read it really blew it. He reads this exciting adventure story like he is bored stiff. He drones on in a monotone voice with extremely few voice inflections and long pauses between conversatons. He doesn't even try to sound like real people would speak their parts.My girlfriend and I are very disappointed with this audio book. As much as I love this book all I can say is DON'T BUY THIS AUDIO BOOK!"
2,Don't bother,"Holy smokes, was this a boring book! If you like reading books where something actually HAPPENS, don't bother with this one. It's just a long, boring diatribe, no action to speak of. And it's not like you're listening to Johnny pondering the vagaries of the universe after seeing his buddies slaughtered in battle, you're listening to his PROFESSOR drone on about in CLASS! I don't think Heinlein could've made it any duller.Bottom line: if you want to read the book because you liked the movie, DON'T. I wish someone had told me that."
3,Star Ship Troopers...not what you expected,"The book Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein was an overall ok book. It was definitely not what I expected when I saw the action packed movie. It had some tidbits of action but those were overpassed by the tremendous amount of conversations. The novel has little developed plot pionts and is mostly the main character's life, with all its ups and downs. I didn't prefer the novel and if someone asked my opinion whether or not they should read the novel, I would tell them not to because it just seems to take too long to read. I felt I would never finish the book because the pace was simply too slow. I believe that it makes a much better movie where there is action and suspense."
1,"starship ,troopers",This book is a characterless bore. A classic this is not. Even the battle scenes are turgid. Half way through I'm giving up.
1,Baaaaad hardcover,"I bought the hardcover because I thought it would be nice to have in my collection. However, the one I bought was an ""econoclad"" book which seems to mean a paperback with a poorly glued on card-board cover. Hardly what anyone would consider a real hardcover. Still a good story if you are not judging it by its cover... but not for the collector looking for a real hardcover."
5,Wonderful!,I loved this book Heinlien really outdid himself this time. I have read alot of his books and this one really stands out. The movie doesn't even do justice to this book. If you saw the movie and thought it was cheese read the book and I promise you will not be able to stop.
5,excellent and a possible prediction of our future,"I thought Starship Troopers was a creative and thoughtful book. I thought it had powerful characters and a barren, alien setting where noone has been before.Altogether, Starship Troopers was an exotic sci-fi novel."
5,This book is cool....,"Starship Troopers is my favorite book. I read it in mysophmore year of high school, on the recommendation of a friend. Iloved the gritty attitudes of the soldiers, as well as their pride, honor, and reality. I was bored at first with the philosophy, but once it I realized it made the story, I kept right on reading. I think the people who don't like the book missed the bottom line of all the philosophy: Only the people who really care about their country are allowed to run it. Those who care more about humanity's welfare then their own. Imagine my disappointment when I was rejected from the Marine Corps, after how much I liked this book! I think that this book ought to be an option for teachers to use in school, possibly in counterpoint to All Quiet On The Western Front."
3,"You should also go look at ""Armor,"" by John Steakley","I've little to add to the other reviews -- Starship Troopers isindeed a must read, I'm trying to get my teenage kids to read itBEFORE the movie comes out this summer."
5,A blueprint for responsibility,"I've read all of Heinlein's books and have read this one 25+ times. Some people have labeled it ""fascist"" but I think they are confusing militaristic with fascist.For me, it works on many different levels. You can relax and treat it like a classic space-romp with aliens, spaceships and cool weapons. Or you can dive in deeper and read several discourses on responsibility and how personal responsibility (or the lack of it) affects all of society. To me, that's what makes this book shine.You will also see a reflection of the times in which it was written. Most notably, the communistic Bugs which are the relentless and hated enemy.This book has had a huge impact on me and I recommend it without reservation."
5,Not an Isaac Asimov or James Clavell but a good story teller,"Starship Troopers -An author, story, probing tale that is as good as all the positive reviews indicate. And a political analysis relative to our present condiditions in this country today.As far as the negative reviewers...""wow"" I wonder what they do like...must be some neo-politically liberal fascist tripe that gives them a grudge against a truly entertaining imaginary book and story.Too bad that the director of the movie (who did a good job on ""Robocop"") gutted the theme and content of the this book to make a mere shadow of the real story line.A friend thought I would find the contrast enlightening. And sure enough I was amazed at what I found. I loved the book but immediately wondered why the film, which had great special effects and which I had watched so many years ago had practically destroyed the real story.Great Book - to bad the film makers could not make a simply movie that matched the true concept behind it.JPL"
2,"Great book, 'sensitive reader makes it, um...sensitive""","Lets face it, for those that have read the novel, the movies are a pretty poor, inaccurate substitute. Well, I like an audiobook, if the reader is appropriate, and inflects their voice (you know-story teller) I can really get lost in it and my imagination makes the experience just as satisfying (if not more so) than a good movie. Well, for me this wasn't going to happen with this character reading. No emotion when he describes combat, or personal interaction. Everything flat, sensitive tone (he seriously needs to put some ""bass in his voice"") Really sad effort for such a great book and not worth a penny, the publisher should pay people to suffer like this."
4,RE: Audiobook Version,"For comments on the content, much has been said before me. I only have this to add. The narrator of Starship Troopers the audiobook is so lacking in skill as a reader, he made it too difficult for me to stay with it. I have given up and ordered a regular book. My recommendation is that you stick with the old fashioned printed format. The wrong narrator can pretty much ruin the experience for you. Too bad, for me anyway, that's exactly what happened."
5,Prophetic,"I don't want to wite a review that is as long as the book, so here's what I say. Although, by today's standards this would be a novella, this small book is packed with action and social commentary. When the fall of western society is explained down to the root cause, it realy makes you think, and then realize that the issues that we see now, were foretold by Heinlein decades before they happened. A brilliant book."
5,I have been waiting for this...,"...I have owned this book for a long time. It's easily my favorite of Robert Heinlein's Science fiction novels, with the possible exception of, ""For Us, The Living"". The reason is because, Heinlein was hailed as the Grandmaster of SF but, this is a book that reminds the experienced reader, that he wasn't exclusively a writer of space stories. This novel is a perfect blend between a war epic and a Science Fiction yarn. It seems as if it was meant to be two, separate tales but, was rushed into being one. The first film adaption was good, the sequels were terrible. No matter what, read this book before you see the movie."
3,Required Reading,Required reading for my son's college course. He is an avid reader so I'm sure he liked the book. Thanks
3,"A good book, but not one of his better ones!!","I can't believe some of the comments people are making about this book. Lighten up folks!I read this book in the late 50's. It was written for kids at a time when Heinlein was putting out a lot of SF. Adults did not read SF! It was read mostly by High School kids who had the imagination to realize we were on the brink of a whole new technological future. At the time I read it no one tried to put any significance to the plot. It was just another good science fiction book at the time a lot of good stuff was being produced.Many years later I met Heinlein at a book signing and told him it was one of the first SF books I had read and kinda hooked me on his writing. At that time he indicated their was no significant effort to send a message to anyone, he just sat down and wrote it as a good yarn.I guess it took a poorly made movie to get people to revisit his book."
5,A masterpiece,"I first read this novel my junior year in High School, and it has remained one of my favorite novels ever since. Some have said that this book makes light of fascism, but this couldn't be further from the truth...In the far future mankind is under the rule of the Federal Government, where before you can vote you must serve the government in some capacity. Usually this is done via a hitch in the military.Rico enlists in the Mobile Infantry, fighting the enemies of mankind in a suit of super powered armor. After surviving his training he goes to war against a race of deadly insects bent on the extermination of mankind."
2,Where's the plot?,"I kept waiting for the plot to start! Heinlein's ideas about citizenship are intriguing, but clumsily presented. There are pages and pages of exposition of these ideas by teacher characters in the book. This type of presentation is way too didactic; it bludgeons the reader over the head. I hope the movie is better"
5,great book.,now this would have been a great movie. really your making me add more words before i can post my comment. amazon fail..ramble ramble ramble
4,Great book.,I thought this book was pretty engaging. It's not all that action oriented (although it has some pretty great bug stomping action) but is a book with a message. I believe a lot of people rate the novel lower because they don't agree with Heinlen's beliefs which is a shame because those same people would rate other sci-fi classics higher and conveniently ignore their blatant biases simply because it fit their views. This book contains a lot of good food for thought.
3,"Interesting, if somewhat predictable","I found the book an interesting read. Though the storyline was somewhat predictable, it proved to be engaging enough, that I read it from cover to cover in just a few sittings. I found his vision of the military dated, and rather conservative, especially as the story line is set in the future. However, if you enjoy Sci-Fi, and/or enjoy military reading, this is a good book to read.If you have seen the movie, there is little resemblance between the movie and the book, and, as is so often the case, the book is by far better."
4,Typical Heinlein Political Messages but a Bit Juvenile,I read this book twice in my life.This book was typical in the Heinlein political and social messages. It was fairly two dimensional. It is certainly not Heinlein's best work. It is a short story that lasted a bit too long. But it is a classic for its kind.
2,Boring,"Although it had it's good moments and some great in depth thought I found everything else to be slow, dragged on, and just plain boring. It took me a week to get through the book because I would find that T.V. was more interesting. Ender's Game is the book you should read."
2,disappointing -- no match for Ender's Game,"After reading so many glowing reviews, I was immensely disappointed in this book. Although it had a few good moments, I generally found it slow, a bit juvenile, and no match for a novel it inspired: Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, a book I couldn't put down."
2,Much ado about not that much,"Sorry, folks, but I didn't find this thing either the work of genius some would have you think, nor the abomination others decry. It basically reads like a recruitment guide for the military. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but if you buy it looking for action you will be sorely disappointed; it begins with action, and there is some action later, but not very much. Seventy-five percent of it is the author's political and/or moral philosophy, as rendered by various teachers, military officers, and the narrator."
5,Starship Troopers,"The book, though used, was in great condition and I am overall very happy with this product. It's a fascinating novel and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure or those who would like to learn more about the military."
2,Boring,Read is just like a military manual. Dry excep[f for once and a while something happens. Mostly it's through the eyes of one soldier. Nothing like the movie and now I see why they doctored the video version so much.
5,Details the Life of a Grunt,"Robert Heinlein's classic of both science fiction and military fiction drama was published nearly fifty years ago. While set in the future, with spaceships and battles with aliens, this book gives a grunt's level view of what being a ground pounder in the infantry is like. The language is cleaned up for the 1950s, but some simple substitution of words and you may think you were watching a recent episode of Generation Kill on HBO.This is a great book, exciting, with vivid detail. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Good book, bad cover.","This book ia one of the best I've read(and I read a lot) but why did you change the original cover? This cover makes the book look like the movie. And if the story hasn't changed then it has very little to do with the movie. Overall I'm very dissapointed with the publishers, but the book is great."
