3,Decent Romance,Two smart attractive people are at a transitional point in their lives. They each take dead end jobs at a zoo to keep busy and bring in a little cash and...whaddaya know: romance blossoms with a couple of standard movie roadblocks that almost keep it from happening. Women will like this one. Men will see every plot twist coming a mile away.
2,Couldn't Finish this Movie,"I was ready to watch an unknown romantic comedy starring some familiar faces, but I just can't finish this movie. It's so formulaic that I just can't. I don't know if the script is to blame, but the situations are just so predictable and there's no chemistry on screen. They go a little too far trying to make EVERY other character in the movie a stereotype of some person the ubiquitous ""we"" don't like very much. This movie might make a front office receptionist feel like a quirky individual with a bright and creative future, but that's a small demographic to win."
4,Adorably endearing,"Though predictable, this movie was adorably endearing. I thought the acting was great, the story was unique and I really enjoyed the plot."
4,Nice little treat,"If you're not too into the impossible fairy tale, A list Hollywood star studded, ultra sappy Romantic Comedies, then this is the perfect little treat for you. This is a nice movie night sort of a film that is perfect for either a couple or the soloist. Its not going to be one of the best movies you have ever seen but it is definitely worth your while and leaves you satisfied."
3,Cute but nothing to write home about.,This is a pretty cute romantic comedy with decent acting. The story stalls in a few places but overall is a charming story with some lighthearted fun. The casting is pretty good but some of the acting leaves a bit to be desired.
4,more than a romance,"I was pleasantly suprised by this movie. Two people searching to find their place in this often overwhelming world...trying to find their voice, their unique expression, and end up finding solice in one another. Good movie."
3,"NOT for everyone, but Good","Sometimes people go through life just not fitting in, not knowing what they want, perhaps even not knowing who they are or how wonderful they are. Things just don't work.But - the right person can change everything. Instantly bring out a really wonderful you... and you just bloom and things just start to work. This is such a story.It's slow, low key - perhaps boring to many for about the first half. The main characters are kind of mousey, quiet, odd personalities most people just won't ""get"" or be all that interested in.... but to watch what happens to them when they meet and start to get to know each other is pretty cool. Like watching a flower grow from bud to full glorious bloom on one of those nature shows.I liked this movie, but it's not one I'd watch again or call my friends and say ""hey, you've got to watch this"" ... you have to be in the mood for something slow and a little odd that takes awhile to start coming together."
4,Nice Little Movie,I really enjoyed this movie. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys romance. I think you'll like it too. Go for it.
2,it aint that good,uhhhhh. a word of advice if you dont have patience dont buy thi game. i read the other reveiews and they said it takes a while to learn tricks. i've had the game for a month or two and i can only do a few tricks. personaly i hate the game. i still cant even grind or spin and i know alot about games
1,Extreme Boards And Blades,This game is terrible and is hard to control and figure out. I recomend you do not buy it.
3,Not too bad to me...,"I think this game is not too bad. The graphics are not too bad (they could be worse!) and the skateparks and locations I thought were very well designed. Those were the good things about it. Now here are the bad things: The game has countless bugs, it takes a while to figure out the key strokes to pull a trick, and if you don't like really weird music, your going to hate the soundtrack. All in all, since I am a hardcore skateboarder, I enjoyed this game somewhat. If your not a skateing fan, your going to wish you bought some Jaw Breakers instead. I wouldn't pay over $15.00 for this game."
2,not so good,"I bought this game because i love skateboar but is not so good the graphism sucks,the grab and all the stuff are badly reproduce,it is good because u have 14 players but who cares and u have the possibilities to choose 154 differents environment which is the nice part but that's all, if i were u know i won't buy it"
1,cheap,"this is a pretty cheaply made game, it is for sure not worth [$] or [$] or whatever they want you to pay for it, it resembles a high school report that was thrown together in a half hour, very cheap, the only way that this game would be worth the money you pay is if you get it for free!"
1,Misses the point,"I'm not going to rant and rave and call Mr. Bennett evil, though his homophobia is sickening. He simply doesn't get it, and I don't think many people do, on EITHER side of ANY argument. In keeping with my ""third position"" thinking, I have a third position here...I believe that the potential societal collapse Mr. Bennett discusses here could be easily averted if only society would be more accepting of those who choose to live without children. I believe a great many people have children almost because they feel like they don't have an option not to. They aren't bad people by any means, they just aren't parent material for any number of reasons, and unfortunately their offspring (and the rest of society) suffer as a result.I know many children of divorce, and I know people who cohabitate. Some of these people are my friends. Blaming them for the downfall of society is something I take personally. There's more to the story than what the morality police will admit."
1,The de-evolution of thought,Bennett book is underpinned by fear and loathing. He blames parties not responsible for the so-called collapse of the family and of morality. Self-righteous myopic heterosexuals like himself need to take stock of their own role in what ever de-evolution they perceive. Stop scapegoating minorities!
1,Poor scholarship; A waste of time,"William Bennett wastes about 20% of this book in an absurd rant against gay marriage. He bases his criticisms on his pathetically out-dated and scientifically disproven belief that gay people choose to be gay. Evidently he wants gay men to marry his daughters, since he allows no other options for gay men in his world. This book is little but empty-headed ranting, scape-goating, and spreading of unfounded myths. To see the basis of this foolishness, readers would do well to see David Brock's ""Blinded by the Right,"" which reminds us that William Bennett once called Rush Limbaugh ""possibly our greatest living American.""The happiest families in America, with the warmest hearths, are those that reject Bennett's demagoguery, ignorance, and hatred disguised as morality."
3,I was a disappointed with this one,"I found out about this recording on the internet. I was a big fan of Bill Evans, especially during his final years with Joe LaBarbara & Marc Johnson. True, this was only Catney's second record, but it didn't live up to the review that I had read. Being that it's out of print I spend a few dollars on it. Wasn't worth it."
4,We're going to have lots of fun,"""We're going to have lots of fun"", is a sentiment of Tommy when talking to Nick about his family, and the fun he's talking about is torture or death. If you enjoy the old gangster movies with George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, and Humphrey Bogart, you will love this movie. A true classic that has been overlooked. Victor Mature is mainly known for his hero roles in the epic movies like ""Samson and Delilah"" or ""The Egyptian"". Here there is no black or white but more grey as he starts out as a criminal that wants to provide and protect his family. When he finds out that his family isn't being provided for by the mob he decides to turn informant. Once they know he has ratted on them, he is as good as a dead man. Mature, Donlevy, and Gray are good, but Widmark steals the show with his giggling over the top psychopath performance as hood Tommy Udo. Right up there with Cagney's performance in ""White Heat""."
5,A Classic From the 1940s,"This movie is an excellent buy for those who enjoy classics of the 1930s - 40s. I especially enjoyed Richard Widmark's performance in his first role as the unstable, evil-laughing gangster Tommy Udo. Victor Mature does a respectable job as the former miscreant trying to start a clean new life by cutting a deal with the district attorney to ""squeal"" on the nasty Udo. All-in-all, it's an enjoyable classic that I would definitely recommend."
4,Interesting Old Movie -,"Richard Widmark plays a sadistic mobster, while Victor Mature is a career thief who wants to reform and take care of his two young daughters. (Originally he kept quiet and wouldn't name his fellow gangsters, but was persuaded to do so after they failed to take care of his wife and children with the proceeds after he was caught in a jewelry heist with three others.) The end of the movie is a bit over the top - Mature gets shot by Widmark in the process of entrapping Widmark and ridding his family of Widmark's threat of revenge. Fortunately, all survive and live happily ever after, except for gangster Widmark."
4,Tommy Udo steals the show.,"This is a solid movie, which has attained classic status simply on the strength of Richard Widmark's unforgettably over the top portrayal of the psychopathic antagonist, Tommy Udo. It would rate acceptable marks in any case, due to it's fine direction, solid performances, and gritty dialogue. Ahh, but Tommy, he has rescued the film from almost certain obscurity...."
5,For a new comer to the movies Widmark is great quite chillin,"Most review the movie about the same Wheelchair cruel etc.You can't help but love him in the part and will not forget him. Has anyone seen Richard Widmark in ""The Bedford Incident"" or some of his later movies? He Is a real fine actor. The movie has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Seeing it once is not enough."
2,Another lousy transfer from Fox!,"Does anyone at Fox bother to look at their DVDs before they are released to the public?Just like with Fox's mediocre release of Mark of Zorro, starring Tyrone Power, in Kiss of Death there are compression artifacts -- check the bars on the holding cell when Brian Donlevy is talking to Victor Mature. Yet this is a dual-layer disc!As well, the print is >bad<. Notice the walls when Richard Widmark climbs to the top of the stairs prior to the film's most famous scene, as well as the walls in the room before he ties up the old lady and pushes her down the stairs -- there are what look like water blotches on the print. Terrible!The obnoxious ad for video piracy at the DVD's beginning accompanied by loud, ugly rock music also doesn't make a good impression."
3,Transfer Belt,Great design with a good buckle and sturdy loops. But the other materials are about half the thickness I pictured and way too slick.With a few modifications such as sewing a good liner to the inside and putting on a keeper so the slack feeds straight into the buckle and does not then slip loose . . . it would be a very good belt and worth fixing.The manufacturer dropped the ball on an excellent design by skimping on some of the materials!
1,"A sad story, badly told","I feel sorry for these two ladies and what they went through in their lives as this is a true story, but this book is just not worth reading. I wish I could say something positive but I can't think of anything. I wish I had not spent money on this book. It is now in my ""donate to the library"" pile."
1,Terrible writing and a pointless tale,"After reading the first page, I wondered; did no one proof-read or edit this book before it was published? The poor grammar and awful writing skills of the author make it almost a punishment to read. I persevered because I thought the story might teach me something important about human nature, or the struggle to survive against insurmountable odds; instead, this is an all-too familiar tale of a mother who had children too young and did not care for them. Nothing more. The build-up that the author tries to give, to imply that some dark scandal would be uncovered, or some deep truth learned by the girls that is important to their lives was a complete fraud. Please do not waste your time on this dreadful book."
3,Boring,This is a three CD set and most of the music sounds redundant. I would have been just as pleased with one CD. I will never listen to most parts of this collection because I would fall asleep.
3,The genius of Ennio Morricone...the producers not so much.,"Ennio Morricone is a genius and his work is monumental. However, when producers create a collection of an artist's work, I wish they would separate the soft, melodic, romantic music from the jazzy, splashy, in your face music. Please put them on separate CDs. After listening to the lovely, sad strains of say “Deborah’s Theme,” I don’t want to have that mood broken by the plucky staccato theme from “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.” I like both, just not next to each other. I could certainly make a remix to suit my liking, but why should I be forced to use my own time and resources to do this? That is why I gave this collection only 3 stars....and it broke my heart to do so."
2,The smell got to me,"I really tried to like this product, but the smell got to me, making it too unappealing to take. Very disappointing."
5,A Long Time Overdue,"This set is AWESOME!!!! The bonus features are outstanding. The remastered prints are pristine. I can't wait for the remaining two seasons. Please Universal, don't make us wait too long."
5,Lindsay Wagner is a Sweetheart.,"What's not to love, I could watch for hours on end, by the way I have watchedfor hours on end. My children love watching as well. Now I just need to know when season 2 is going to be released."
4,A nice trip back in time,"As one of the enjoyable hits of the 70s, it is nice to go back and relive the pilot of The Bionic Woman. A good show, with a nice cast."
5,Lindsay Makes Jaime Run!,"I was so pleased when I learned that the first season of ""The Bionic Woman"" was to be released on DVD; I added it to my cart immediately and pre-ordered it just before the release date. I enjoyed the show originally and, more so, on DVD.The very best thing about ""The Bionic Woman"" is its star. It's always a pleasure to watch Lindsay Wagner's work because her style is so natural. You will never catch her acting. And her style and her personality make Jaime Sommers very real, quite believable, and thoroughly adorable.I'm looking forward to the release of the remaining seasons. Bring them on!"
5,At long last!,"I have been waiting years, no DECADES to see again the show that captured my heart and mind so completely as a child. Watching these episodes again, I understand better why this show meant so much to me. My family teased me for my Bionic Woman obsession, but I see now that Jaime Sommers was the kind of positive older friend/mentor/confidante/role model I desperately needed. She was warm, funny, confident, caring, courageous, and--of course--strong. I can honestly say that watching this show made my life a happier place to be during some difficult years. Lindsay Wagner's charm and natural acting style elevates the material and I am enjoying these episodes as much as I did when I was a kid. I eagerly await the chance to purchase the remaining seasons (fembots!). Good things do come to those who wait."
2,"Not thrilled, certainly doesn't compare to Bionic Man","I got the new Six Million Dollar Man DVD setThe Six Million Dollar Man The Complete Seriesand my entire family was enthralled at how enjoyable the episodes were! Even the last season which certainly was fragmented was far more fun than I recall but I was very young at the time. As soon as we completed those DVDs, we got this, Bionic Woman, Season One DVD and we are SO dissappointed. the first few episodes are good but it starts to go downhill in quality about the 4th episode and never comes back. She just doesn't have the Star staying power that Lee Majors has."
2,"Bionic Woman, seasons 1-3",The TV shows were in color; the dvds are black and white. This was not disclosed at the time of purchase. Disappointing to say the least.
3,Wanted more of Steve Austin and Jamie together,Wanted to see more of Steve Austin and Jamie working together with their bionics. But this had a good story line.
3,bionic woman,"the sound goes out once in a while,otherwise great.i will be ordering more of the bionic woman episodes.i am pleased you have it."
5,good series,Great series although I do like the Six Million Dollar Man better. You know that if they had a television show like this 35 years ago that they probably have a real Bionic Man or Bionic Woman. I'm talking about someone just like on TV with those abilities or maybe even more advanced.
5,FINALLY! NOW ON WITH SEASONS 2 & 3!,"Thanks to everyone who worked hard to get ""The Bionic Woman"" released in the U.S., and to Lindsay Wagner for doing such an amazing job portraying this wonderful character!Lastly, for future posters, please note: The character's name is spelled ""Jaime Sommers,"" and the leading role was played by Lindsay (again, note the spelling) Wagner.Enjoy!"
1,The Bionic Woman / Six Million Dollar man,"For those of your waiting for the Universal Studios release of the BW and SMDM, the wait is nearly over. Universal was in the process of merging with another company and therefore no Universal series were being released until the merger was complete. I'm happy to report that the merger has finally been completed and the studio is now preparing to release it's most requested series on DVD sets, this is to include the BW and SMDM."
1,Why the Delay,"I can't understand why the Bionic Woman and the SMDM are not out on DVD yet. It is frustrating not being able to share with my children a little of my oun childhood, throught the TV shows that my family could not get enough of."
5,JayR,Being a boy back in the 70's and trying to sell an adventure show featuring a female lead was a tough sell back then. There was wonder women with Lynda Carter and lyndsay Wagner of the bionic women. However these 2 shows proved that women could hold there own without relyng on a male conterpart to help them. I'm glad that the bionic women is finally coming out dvd.
4,1980s Classic,"This is not only a great 1980s television classic but a great follow up to your Bionic Man DVD collection. Same great special effects, same great special missions only Jaime Sommers is much better looking than Steve Austin was. If you're a fan of bionics then this is the right show to buy."
5,"Coming out on DVD on October 19, 2010","Yes, Bionic Woman (as well as Six Million Dollar Man) is coming out on dvd in the USA! Bionic Woman will be released on October 19, 2010 on 4 discs. The legal problems have all been worked out. Universal Studios is now in the process of working out all the details of the releases. The episodes should all be remastered from the original source films. It will have the original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 & the audio is Dolby Digital 2.0."
2,American Remake,"This is an American remake of an English television miniseries. What is wrong with the writers in America can't the come up with any ideas that are original, or is it easier to use somebody else's story, and how if the original story was a miniseries, 3-4 hours long, can you tell the same story in half the time."
2,Everyone loses,"The only performance I enjoyed was from Devan Sawa (Final Destination). Anwar's character is first raped, then killed. Pullman's character is unsympathetic. Although I enjoyed the director teasing me with the prospect of Anwar undressing in her apartment. But definitely not a feel-good film."
4,Review of purchase of new wiper blades for 2 cars,"The blades were easily installed and are working very well. I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I will probably buy my next set of plades through Amazon. My only problem was in the ordering as I assumed that one order was automatically for two blades, so when I ordered two, I expected to get two sets of two blades each, but I only received two blades and had to place a second order for two more blades."
1,Never again ..,Despite consulting 2 different auto consumer sites .. each recommending the exact same wipers for my 2007 Saturn Aura .. and despite attempts by 2 different professional auto mechanics .. these wipers were impossible to install and were returned.
1,Not For Infiniti M37X,"Amazon recommended a wiper blade shorter than the originally installed blade. I went with the originally installed length. The orginal blade connector is offset (which I did not notice before and which is apparently why Amazon recommended a shorter blade,) therefore none of the blades will fit correctly. The recommended blade does not clean a big enough space while the orginal length contacts the passenger side blade making a noise during operation. Not sure what the fix is but this blade is not satisfactory for the 2012 Infiniti M37X."
2,Cleaned Great! Doesn't do Car Washes,"It was easy to install, didn't streak. It was on the car for ~45 days, when I went through a car wash. When I drove slowly through the dryer. It pulled it right off!!! And what's worse is the Hurricane Isaac rains are hitting MO tomorrow, so I have to run around town 2 hours before stores close to find a new one."
4,still going........,"I purchased a set of these well over a year ago, they still work great, even after our incredibly hot summer. I would give them 5 stars, but I think the price is a bit high"
1,Windshield wiper 28 inch,"This was the right size for my car, but it did not fit and could not be used. The passinger side worked fine. It must be defective."
4,Great.................,Ended up getting rid of the truck i put them on so i cant speak to their durability but they were excellent for the few months i had them on.
2,Would have worked great if it fit...,Despite using the drop down menus on the product page this was the wrong size for my car. Had to buy another brand of wiper from Autozone and it worked fine. The passenger wiper fit and works great.
2,Poor Packaging,Wipers came fast and excited to put on car. Only problem packed in over large box that was crushed and one of the blades was damaged. Nice return policy but problem could have easily been avoided and my delay with proper packaging.
2,Streaks after a few weeks,"I bought these because I heard they are streakless and last for a long time. The driver side one lasted a few weeks before I started having streaks. I drive a 08 Honda Accord and after 2 months now, the wipers do not clean 100% without leaving huge streaks. I have spray the water profusely for a simple cleaning. After wiping countless times though, my window is clean without streaks, but I am not satisfied and will not purchase again."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE 'em,"OMG, I have been tortured by name brand wipers (Michelin, Bosch, Trico)over the last year. The most common issue is the rubbing-dragging sound across the windshield. UGH! It drives me insane. Someone mentioned that the Valeo resolved this issue for them in a review. In desperation and without hesitation I purchased a pair. Let me just say these cost 1/2 of what I have been paying for wipers.YES! the problem is solved. I have had zero issues since installing them on my Taco. They don't drag and effortlessly keep the windshield clear. I highly recommend these to anyone who has had a similar problem."
4,Good windshield wiper,"Nothing special here. It's a decent looking windshield wiper that does what it's supposed to. Not quite as modern looking as my last wipers (Bosch), but they do the trick, they're inexpensive, and supposedly they are durable."
1,Flimsy connector broke during installation,"When I tried to install this wiper blade, I applied very little force, but the plastic connector broke. I have experience with car repairs, and doubt this result can be attributed to lack of skill."
4,Valeo 600-22 wiper review,I bought a set of these wipers one year ago. I ski once or twice a week in the winter. The wipers preformed above average for the first snow season here in Idaho. They also performed well through the spring rainy season with little streaking or chattering. They work as well as possible running through mud on dirt roads in wet conditions. I definitely worked them in the mud. They mostly lasted through the hot summer sun in southern Idaho. After 1 year they definitely need replacing. I usually buy better than average wipers and these performed very well. But don't expect them to last more than a year. I gave them 4 stars because they did not substantially outperform other good wipers and they are a bit expensive. My most important relevant review is that I have just ordered another set.
5,Veleo windshield wiper blades,"Regarding the Veleo blades ... I really like them as of right now (I just installed them and haven't been using them all that long). They're quiet, they clean the windshield completely, and I've used them in rain, snow, and removing melted (defrosted) windshield ice. I have no complaints and would recommend them without reservation. As a matter of fact, I plan to order more when I need them. For what it's worth, I checked area stores (Auto Zone, Walmart, Costco, BJ's, et al) and was not able to find them. The only place I found them was through Amazon.com. No compalints there, though, because I got them within two or three days and without a shipping charge due to their price. Oh ... caveat ... before you order any, measure your windshield wioer blades because each blade will more than like likely have a different length."
5,Valeo wiper blade,"The Valeo wiper blade met all my expectations - no streaking, no smearing, no rubbing. I really do think it is the best."
1,Bad experience on first use,"Like many others, I have been in an ongoing search to find the ""perfect"" wiper blades. I guess they don't exist!I installed a new pair of these blades before we took a 300-mile driving trip to Minnesota. On the way, we drove through rain, sleet, and snow. The temperature was in the 30s the whole way (never below freezing).The blades chattered and streaked. Yes, I did install them properly. These blades are not listed as ""summer-only"" so I assume they were designed to work in cold weather. For us, they did not.So, it's back to the drawing board. I have used Bosch blades in the past. They are OK. I will also be trying some Rain-X."
1,would not recommend,"I bought 4 of these blades of various lengths (20, [2] 22s, and a 24). Most (not all, mind you) of them smear already. I wouldn't recommend this blade, and definitely would not buy again. I bought due to the other overall good reviews, and the fact that at one point in time, Consumer Reports also recommended them. Considering several of these blades smear already, either Amazon sells blades that have a really old manufacture date and the rubber has worn out, or the product isn't up to par. I'm not sure which since I had a similar experience with some Rain-X blades too (also purchased from Amazon)."
1,Assmebled wrong and customer service was unhelpful,The wiper was assembled backward at the plant with the tabs that hold the wiper to the blade on teh wrong end of the blade assembly. Had to take the wiper apart and reverse it to get it to fit in the wiper housing on my Porsche Cayenne S.Once reassembled it works poorly as there is a good 3 inches of the wiper that do not make clear contact with the glass.I called customer service and they weren't helpful.My experience in this case was that Valeo couldn't assemble their own wiper properly and then when contacted didn't care that they blew it. Won't buy another Valeo product.
1,Absolutely a waste of money.,These did not work properly from Day 1. I should have just bought the cheaper blade refills at Wal Mart.
1,"Steaks out of the package, GRRRR",I'm posting a picture of these wipers leaving streaks behind on the FIRST use.They are awful. I'm sticking with Honda OEM blades from now on.
2,feels cheap,"i thinki ver payed for this wiper. it doesnt seem to work any better than stock wipers.this one in particular came bent, i didnt feel like taking the time to send it back because it was raining and i needed it so, i played with it and bent it to the point where it was useable. never buying these and from this company again. Im gonna try rain X in about 6 months,"
1,flimsy mounting point,"They did not last 4 months the mounting point snapped off first ice event. This was my third set of new style blades. First ones that this happened to. THEY DO NOT compare in quality to any other blades. Store out of Bosch, I tried new top of the line Rain ex and could not get a positive lock with them I ended up with cheaper Michelin on driver side it cleans as well as the EXPENSIVE poorly made Valeos"
1,Meh .. :(,"I've owned these for about a month now. Unfortunately, I had to return them for a full refund just two days ago.The wiper blades worked perfectly when I first installed them. Installation was a breeze, took about a minute to install both. Simple tug and snap on.A few days after the install the driver side started creating streaks while the passenger side was perfect. I tried cleaning out the driver blade to no avail, I even returned it for a replacement blade and I still experienced the same streak.The blades got so bad that they had long streaks from one end of my glass to the other end which wouldn't come off with normal washer fluid. I had to wipe it off with a towel otherwise it would sit there. Both blades started doing this about a week ago.So as I said in the beginning, I returned these and then I purchased Valeo 900 blades, so far they're working even better than these 600's. My windows are squeaky clean."
4,Great rear wiper for Saturn Vue,"I have a 2004 Saturn Vue and have struggled to find a decent wiper for the rear glass of the vehicle. My last wiper was a Bosch and it did a poor job. The ends of the wiper weren't even in contact with the glass, which made the cleaning area even smaller. This Valeo wiper stays in contact with the glass for the entire sweep, and makes a nice, clean pass of the glass.Great product and highly recommended for a rear wiper.One thing to keep in mind though is that the adapter that comes with this wiper won't work on the Vue. You will need to pop off this adapter and the adapter off of the old wiper. Then re-install the adapter from the old wiper onto the new wiper. It's a pain, but will work out in the end. I got the adapters off by prying them off with a small flat blade screwdriver."
3,valeo 600-17 wiper blades,after reading reviews about this product i thought i would try them there are suppose to be one of the best i find they work but not any better then the cheaper ones at the auto parts store but more money will see how long they last but i dont think i will pay the price for them again
2,Not very good,"I am disappointed with the Valeo wipers. They were expensive and have failed to deliver better performance than the cheaper wipers. In fact, they began to streak noticibly on two of the three vehicles that I installed them on, after only one month of use. Don't waste your money; get the cheaper wipers and refils..."
3,Ok......but,"The Valeo blades provide for a clean sweep and are quieter than my previous blades (Petsmart ""special"") but will chatter/skip after the first few sweeps, even during a steady or heavy rain fall. Maybe its my wiper motors??? I have a 2005 Wrangler. May try the Silblades next."
3,Mediocre,"this is the wiper blade recommended for the rear of my 2001 Outback wagon (according to Valeo's application guide) so i went ahead and picked one up since i have the Ultimates on the front and like em a lot. well, the 600 is nothing like the Ultimate. it streaks and leaves dead spots along the edge of the wiper path. i really now only use it when i absolutely can't see out the back, otherwise it just makes a mess of the window. my hope is that they make a bracketless wiper in the size i need so i can use it on the rear b/c the fronts are excellent wipers. until then, i might try the Trico Neoforms since they have a bracketless design to fit my rear window."
5,"High Performance, Long Lasting","-Streak Free, Perfectly Clear Wiping-Whisper Quiet-Performs Great 11+ MonthsApparently you are supposed to replace your wipers every 6 months. I try to stretch that as long as possible, and these have been performing great for about a year. Very little dip in performance from when I first installed them. I could hold out for another 3 months.Keep in mind, I store my car outside year-round, with 4 months of snow and ice.One caveat: The plastic clip used to secure the wiper broke while I was cleaning ice off of it. I was being a tad too rough with it. Just remember to be gentle."
1,Streaks Immediately,"I bought these wiper blades because they were recommended by Consumer Reports, and I have had good luck with Consumer Reports - not anymore!Both of the 24"" blades, for our Corolla and Rav4, were streaky from the first moment used. At least they were silent, but the streaks are bad - worse on the Corolla. I would recommend going to an auto parts store for something like this, instead of ordering on-line. Lesson learned."
3,wipers work but.......,Wipers work good but when they arrived they are missing a clip to connect to the car. I had to find an alternative clip.
1,Doesn't maintain contact with windshield,"Bought 3 of these blades. The passenger side and rear blade work great but the 26"" blade is worthless on my CRV. About 1/2 the blade makes contact with the windshield and the other 1/2 doesn't touch the glass. Unless a product truly fails, I don't write a negative review. This blade was a complete failure."
2,Not in Maine,Great wiper for rain but not good for winter use. Iced up and the efficiency dropped to a very low level.
4,Good stuff,"The blade seems to be working well. My only complaint is that the part finder on Amazon told me to get the wrong blade, so I had to return the other one and get this one instead."
5,Valeo 600-22 Series Wiper,"Great fit and inexpensive. It took a little to install as I've never installed wipers myself, but it was easy enough and they work great. One review was for the driver and the other is for the passenger side wipers."
5,Work Great,"I have had these on my car for about 6 months now and they are holding up great. They held up through a very rough winter and are still wiping beautifully. They installed very easily on my 2001 infinity I30. I also bought them for my girlfriends 2002 Lexus LS430 and had some problems since Lexus has some crazy not at all standard wiper hooks. I had looked up compatibility and they should have worked. I eventually got em on, and they are staying on, but I don't think they were actually compatible."
3,A little complicated,"These wiper blades are probably fine, but a little confusing and complicated to install. I'm not a real handy guy so I had trouble putting them on."
4,Excellent wipes,Excellent performance. Installation instructions not intuitive.Took off one star for the price though.
2,Waste of money,The plastic clip broke off completely when I tried to attach with only the slightest force. I went with the Rain-X instead and couldn't be happier.
1,wiper clip broken,"wipers worked well, untill one of the clips that secures it to the wiper arm broke. It only took two weeks to find a weak link on these wipers. luckily I put electrical tape on it and got it to stay put. hope others have better luck than I did!"
2,Valeo 600 wiper blades,"These were a disappointment. Consumer Reports rated them highly, so I bought them. They worked fine when new, but they needed replacement in less than a year. That's much faster than any I can remember. I'm trying the Goodyear Blades I picked up at Costco now."
3,Hard to install,"I have been changing my own wiper blades for awhile and have never had any problems-except with this one. This was a pain in the a** to get on! After I thought that I had it on correctly, it fell off, so I ordered another one. Same issue-very difficult to get on. I have no idea why since I have changed that blade before and have never had problems."
3,Streaks on the return swipe,"Strangely enough, these wipers wipe perfectly out the outward swipe, but leave a large streak down the center on the return swipe. I've cleaned the glass repeatedly, to ensure there are no contaminants or buildup, and the fact that it will wipe well on the outward swipe tells me the glass is not the problem. Something in the design causes the blade to streak every time it swipes back downward on my 2011 Subaru WRX.Disappointing, because they look and fit great."
5,Great quiet wipers,"I bought these because I read about them in Consumer Reports. They are all they are supposed to be. They clean the windshield streak free in the rain or drizzle, and they are quiet. I like them, and would recommend them.Update Jan 2013... Wiper blades are working well, and are still quiet."
2,Streaks after 2 Months,"Bought these in June 2012 for my Honda civic. It is now August 2012 and there's some streaking with these. To be fair, my previous wipers were Bosch and they had the same issue so perhaps it's something with my car. Either way, the streaking isn't bad enough to return them but I expected these wipers to last at least 6 months without impairing visibility."
4,"Works Great, No Chatter",I use to use the Bosch wiper blades till I found theses. They work great and last an entire year up here in rainy Seattle. I would recommend you use a glass polish before you install these and then every few months (until the windshield gets streaky from contaminates). I really like the No Touch! brand of polish.
5,How many wipers on YOUR car??,"Absolutely no complaints about the wipers...my complaint is that nowhere in the description does it mention you are getting ONLY ONE wiper. I have never bought wipers before that were not in a pair. I'm not aware of any automobiles that use only one wiper. Valero can sell their wipers any way they want, but I think it should be noted somewhere that you are not buying a pair, but a single wiper."
4,Excellent Wipers so far,"I bought these about a month ago and while I would give them a ""5"" star rating not enough time has passed since I bought them. That's the reason I bought them, so they would last longer than a set of cheapies. So far I would have to say they are great. I could tell the difference immediately when I put them on. Nice, quiet, and clean wipe with no streaks. So far so good. Will have to evaluate longer to see if they are truly that great."
3,Lousy Clip,Clip to hold wiper blade to wiper armwas wrong. I had to use an old one Ihad to click in place.Vehicle used on 2002 Odyssey Van.Bought these because pretty high ratedin Consumer Reports.
4,Valeo 600-22 wipers for 2011 Avalanche,"I have only had these a couple of weeks, but they seem to be a quality wiper. They are certainly just as good as any OEM wiper. My only complaint is that they seem to be about .75 inches shorter than the OEM wipers that were on my vehicle. This is not a huge deal, but it caused me to not give five stars."
1,Blade does not work with 2007 Honda CRV,"The 26"" Valeo Series Wiper blade was the right length and connected in correctly to the wiper arm. Unfortunately it did not contact the windshield fully and left a path of 8-10"" unwiped. Very disappointed!"
2,Worked decent for about 3 months,"Worked fantastic at first, but only lasted about 3 months, leaves streaks allover and misses alot of water now. Made sure they were still installed right, but they just dont last very long"
4,great wiper,"I was looking to purchase a pair of wipers. I wanted something inexpensive, reliable, and durable. I got exactly what I was looking for in this product. I've had these wipers for a little over 3 months now and so far so good. I would recommend them to anyone looking to purchase new wipers'."
4,"Good blade, but streaks a little","I got these to replace my old Rain-X blades (one 21"", one 22""). I like the Rain-X ones, but these were rated a little higher so I thought I would give them a try. The first time I used them they streaked quite a bit. When I got home I cleaned my windshield because I thought that might help. It did help, but there was still a little streaking. It was not very bad and I would not return them for it, but I expect no streaking at all from new blades so I was a little disappointed, especially since they were a few dollars more than other blades. I would not say these are bad blades, but I will probably go with another brand next time."
1,Terrible,After all the good reviews I decided try these. Very disapponted. The first frost and they didn't make contact with the windshield. very noisy too. I will go back to rainx or Bosch.
5,wiper blades,"Initially worked perfect and as advertised by Amazon. Have to wait and see what happens after 6 moths. After 6 months they did not last any longer than my Toyota blades. However, I must admit that my Toyota Camry right side wiper blade never worked correctly from when I bought it new. When I replaced it with the Valeo blade it worked perfectly."
5,Superior wipers,"Have several vehicles and tried other hi-end wiper blades Valeo aremost flexible and ""most quiet"" in light rain conditions .Can't comment on longevity yet ."
1,Stay AWAY from these wipers if your a Jeep owner...,"I installed these wipers as a replacement for the Silblades I normally use on my Jeep Wrangler. It rained the day after installation, and they performed horrifically.They left a black rubber residue all over my Jeep's windshield, which of course caused the blades to D-D-D-drag across the surface, the added resistance will eventually cause he windshield wiper's motor to burn out. Now I'm going to have to take a razor blade to the windshield to remove the black rubber left on it and purchase new wipers, only after 1 day of use.In the spirit of full disclosure, the Silblades I normally purchase nominally last 3 years; however, no one had the 13"" Silblades I needed in stock, so I tried these ""high end blades"" due to the good reviews, now I wish I had simply waited for the Silblades to become available, as I've just thrown away good $."
2,It never fitted good,on my car's windshield. I lost one piece while driving in the rain. I don't know why it came off completely without warning.
1,it does not wipe,"I bought two of wiper, one set for a Honda Ridgeline 2008 and another for a Mitsubishi Galant 2001, as these were highest regarded in Consumer Reports web site. on both vehicles the wipers leaves a wide stream of water on the windshield on the way down. I left them on for a few weeks but things didn't improve. A total waste!!!"
2,Needs replacing after 7 months of use,"I'm not sure how long wiper blades are supposed to last, but after just 7 months we have to replace this one. We've been using it on our 2006 Toyota Prius and it worked great when it was new-no streaks or squeaking, but now it leaves a bit of a haze on the glass that we find difficult to drive with. I was hoping to get a year out of it; maybe that was too optimistic?"
3,Not any better than the cheap versions!,Ive always bought the cheap walmart blades (trico?) and they only last about 6mo. these only lasted about 6 mo before they got streaky also; much more expensive and I wanted them to last longer. the first month they probably work better overall and they didnt make as much noise as the cheaper ones. In the end Im happy with the cheaper brand. sorry.
3,Didn't fit Altima,"I've use these 600 series blades and they work great but the 28"" doesn't fit my 2008 Altima even though they say it does. The connector does not fit and there is only one connector in the package. Other manufactures provide multiple connectors to fit various wiper arms but Valeo does not."
3,Smearing,"Put these wipers on an Acura TL and they began smearing almost immediately. Not terrible, but not performing above average."
5,They Wipe,"I haven't even installed these yet, but they're windshield wipers. How complicated can they be? I'm assuming that when I turn them on, they will clear the windshield. Mainly, I want to clear them from the list of items I have to review."
3,Nice Wipers,"Wipers seem to work fine after several rains. They are highly recommended by Consumer Reports. My only disappointment is that the plastic blister packaging was not of a readily recyclable type. Post consumer, recycled cardboard would have been better still."
1,Doesn't conform to windshield and obnoxiously loud!,"When using the new wipers, it doesn't press firmly to the windshield. This causes streaks/smears that sometimes makes visibility worse than not using the wipers. Also, when the wipers hit the apex of each wipe, there is an atypically loud annoying thud. This sound is due to the rubber blade changing position during its initial movement to the other direction. I have never experienced such garbage wipers and am thoroughly disappointed with them. Back they go!"
4,Good product with a decent price,"I purchased these to replace Rain-X wipers on my 2002 Elantra GT. Its performance is probably a bit better but it wipes much quieter. The installation was quite simple and fool-proof. If pricing is under 10 bucks, then it will be a really great deal."
2,Streaky Wipe,"I was previously using Bosch Icons before on my car and I was really happy with their performance until they wore out after only 4 or 5 months. The Valeo 600 wipers are rated Consumer Reports best value and have had very good reviews so I gave them a try. I've had them for about a month now and I dont know if they will get better with age but so far not very good. I use 24"" on the driver side and 20"" on the passenger side as well as one 20"" on the rear. The 20"" wipers seem fine but the 24"" never wipes clean. It leaves a huge 5"" wide unwiped streak on my windshield. Maybe these 24"" dont fit my car very well (Acura RSX). I'll probably go back to using Icons but it was worth a try considering these are supposed to last a good long time and cost less than half the price of the Icons."
1,Leaves streaks,I bought these wipers because they were top rated by Consumer Reports. The drivers side leaves large streaks. The year old generics that I had before wiped better than these brand new. Very disappointed.
2,Product does not fit my 2007 Volvo V50 as indicated,"I purchased this for my 2007 Volvo V50 after verifying that it would fit my vehicle.After receiving the wiper and inspecting it, it is not going to fit into the vehicle's wiper arm.My wiper arm expects the wiper to have a metal post that snaps into the wiper arm. None of the adapters supplied had this type of fitting. Also the width of the wiper would not fit into the wiper arm housing."
2,Wiper does not wipe entire area on a Honda CRV,"These wipers were rated high and they may work well on some cars but hot on my 2008 Honda CRV.One wiper is 26"" long and one 16""The 26"" one does not wipe the entire area. The curve is off.Would suggest just going to a store near you and buy them there. Then if that brand does not fit you can just take them back in the store and pick out another brand.I wish they would not just make in different lengths to fit all cars and hope they work. But acually try them on all cars to make sure they fit."
1,No go on Altima 2007,"Site said this would work on my Altima Hybrid 2007. The connector is so much bigger than the other 17"" wiper blade I purchased on the site. Returned."
5,Great so far,"I bought this with the 19"" for my 2006 Mazda 3-I 4 door. Easy to install, no problems and they work great."
1,Warning for Honda CR-V owners,"This blade does not fit Honda CR-V 2009. It does not match curvature of the windshield. It presses too much on one side and hangs in the air on another side. The same issue with 26"" blade for the driver side.Amazon indicates that this blade fits Honda CR-V 2009 if add it to your garage on Amazon. That's incorrect."
3,Fair,"I had looked at many reviews of wipers online before purchasing. With all of the hype, I was a bit disappointed. The wipers work well but aren't really anything special. I would buy these again but they aren't as great as other reviews led me to believe."
1,Warning for Honda CR-V owners,"This blade does not fit Honda CR-V 2009. It does not match curvature of the windshield. It presses too much on one side and hangs in the air on another side. The same issue with 16"" blade for the passenger side.Amazon indicates that this blade fits Honda CR-V 2009 if add it to your garage on Amazon. That's incorrect.Just got Bosch 4826 and it fits perfectly."
5,Yes! All clear now!,"A nice clear windshield again! Makes my windshield on my 96 Lexus dirt and water free from end to end. Like new! No streaks and it fits firmly to the wind shield so it doesn't miss a spot! Great!My only complaint would be someone should tell do it yourself-ers that the drivers windshield is longer than the passenger side, otherwise you have two different sizes Amazon says would fit my car. It was confusing until I discovered it for myself when replacing the wiper."
4,Best ones I have had yet!,Hard to install but finally got them on. They work great although still some streaking when the windshielis dirty if you don't use the washers 3 or 4 times.
4,Valeo 600-20 Wiper Blades,Installed on my 2002 F150. Installation went well and was documented on the package. Blades move water cleanly.Would buy again.
2,Not recommended. Image Quality suffers poorly,"I've used this tele-converter with Sigma 150 mm Macro lens for taking macro shots (no tubes used). I decided to go for 2X instead of 1.4X as I thought the reach would be better. The sigma 150 mm is a very sharp lens and I've taken some fantastic macro shots with it. When I use the 2x TC, the image quality suffers. The pictures are never sharp even in bright sunlight and very high shutter speed, most pictures turn out to be blurry. The autofocus works sometimes but it didn't work for me most of the time.. I would not recommend it."
1,Too Old - 123 in SmartSuite 9.8 is Most Current,"I'm surprised software this old is still for sale. I've used 123 since the mid-80s and still prefer it to Excel, even through I have the most current version of Office. I believe your best value is to buy the most current version of 123 as part of Lotus SmartSuite 9.8/9.8.2 (available for a couple of dollars more on Amazon); I bought my copy about a decade ago. I originally ran SmartSuite 123 and WordPro under Windows 98 and currently run it under Windows 7 Enterprise and Mac OSX Lion using Parallels. SmartSuite also includes Word Pro, which is an excellent word processor, and Freelance, which was good in its day (over a decade ago) but not competitive with Power Point 2003 or later."
4,Good classic reprint,"When I bought this book I didn't know that it was a photocopied reprint of H. Irving Handcock's 1906 Jiu-jitsu combat tricks. Even though the text is a little out dated; it is one of the first English written books on Jiu-jitsu which makes it valuable to anyone interested in the roots of Jiu-jitsu. It gives the reader an incite into what Jiu-jitsu was at the turn of the century, way before Gracie Jiu-jitsu or Judo was ever heard of in America. This book has excellant vintage photos of old Jiu-jitsu guys showing some common and uncommon techniques. This isn't what I expected but it is well worth the money to have it in my collection."
1,Rip-Off: Literally,This book is a copy of three other books each of which is about 100 years old. I'm not kidding!
1,Scam or Misprint.,Ordered 2 sets of 6 and received only two 12 oz. bags. $43.00 with shipping. No way!!! Still waiting on return info and hopefully a full refund.
1,So long and boring,"I saw this movie 12 years ago when a classmate brought this movie to school to show to the whole class. Because we need a good lession on jewish culture. I'am not jewish and neither were all of my classmate. But my teacher poped this in the VCR and watched it sitting in hard chairs with no deck in front of each of us. This movie was sooooooo boring, it put me to sleep. I fell a sleep with my chin touching my chest. neither of me and my classmate could hardly stay awake. We didnt finish the whole movie at all."
4,Good to see this again,"""Skokie"" was, I believe, the last vehicle for Danny Kaye, and one of his few serious roles. I was most impressed with it when it first aired, and had tried to find it over the years since. Danny Kaye is terrific, and surprising, in the role he plays. A young George Dzundza, whom I did not remember as having been in it, delivered an excellent performance as well. Over all I was delighted with the DVD although I wish there had been some more of the history of the true incident, and of the fine cast, included as special features."
3,"Not bad - pretty girls, interesting plot","Not a bad bit of Phillipine exploitation, but it's either cut somewhat, or the controversial ""lesbian scene"" was a simple kiss. The plot does tell a tale of small-town intolerance, with a dramatic ending - but it's not exactly the peak of storytelling excellence."
2,Holy Fragarolly!!!!!,"I don't know what to say. i got this movie based on the cover and some of the early reviews that it was going to be a a lot of pretty island chicks naked and running around and stuff. How could I have been so wrong? Beheadings, gang-rapes, waaayy too much adolescent nudity(!), animal cruelty, and just for the hell of it, naked grown men fighting with kids. And you know what? I still don't know what the movie is about. I'm not even sure that it's legal to have a copy of this thing! If you want to see a raw, crude, mouth dropping movie, get this film. I've seen cannibal films and stuff like that but this was shocking. I can't even decide if its a good shocking or a bad shocking. Wow...."
1,Silip: Extremely Disappointing,"This is not a lesbian themed movie. Do not waste your time unless you are looking to see one confused woman's view on sex and religion. In summary, this movie is about animal abuse, female abuse, and foreign poverty. Amazon should remove the ""Lesbian"" tag for this flick."
1,the movie sucks!!!,"the movie itself is very lame, the story sucks!!! unnecessary violence, its not good at all. the gals are pretty that's about it."
1,Garbage,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is utter garbage. The acting, the dialog, all of it is horrible. I am going to give this movie away to the first sucker I see. Do not waste your time and especially don't waste your money on this trash."
5,Still a great classic!,"Had to get a replacement disk to reload my computer because my old disk was damaged. Love playing friends on my network. Only problem, won't work on my new Windows 7 64 bit system. I have enough old machines to rely on though! Which Activision would update this to run on the new platforms!"
1,Boring!!,"zzzzz! I was really disappointed! The book offers nothing new, interesting or exciting. The author claims to be a professional photographer as well as a ghost hunter, but I didn't see any photos in the book except some orbs, mist and a vortex or two. Considering the fact that the author has visited some of the most haunted places in the world, I would expect a more detailed and believable account of her experiences. In checking out her web sites I found the same information and photos which that were in the book, which left me wondering why anyone would choose to buy it."
5,Fantastic Scary Book!,This is the best scary book! I couldn't put it down and when I finally did I had a hard time going to sleep. I recommend this book to anyone who likes ghosts and scary things!
1,Even Greater Operatic Disasters,"As a former opera singer and the wife of a retired Metropolitan Opera condutor, I've seen many boo-boos on stage and off. However, Mr Vickers' book, as well as his first one on the same subject, offers spurious stories and ""urban legends"". Many of his ""facts"" are just wrong! In this sequel to ""Great Operatic Disasters"", most of his so-called disasters aren't even funny!"
1,Not too good.,I play a lot of games of all types but this one wont get a second try. The graphics are week and the gameplay isn't too fun.
1,A Headache,this game - is horrible. im a bullrider myself and i scoff at this games existance. the camera angles are horrid - so are the graphics - it might was well be a NES game its choppy and thrown to together - aviod this game. go buy somethin else. save your money.
1,You paid for this?,"Heck, ive seen better games created by 1 man, in 2 hours! Pong has better graphics than this crapola"
2,out of print,i would like to buy this book but cannot find it anywhere. if anyone sell it let me know i will probably buy it depends on the price.
2,Not as good,"I had another brand of Maria cookies and loved them so decided to order some but didn't know what brand they were, just that they were in a red package.. I decided all Maria cookies should be good as its a simple cookie..not so, these a re slightly over baked and leave an after taste like when shortening or oil is rancid...and I had to order a case which is 24 packages...boy will I not make a mistake like that again...I only have myself to blame..just hope the Goya company checks their baking times and their ingredients...never again...."
1,Disappointed with Goya product,"I loved the Goya Maria crackers which I bought initially in a supermarket in Florida. Since this product was seldom on the shelves in my hometown supermarkets,I decided to buy direct from Goya and ordered a carton of 24 packages. Each one I opened was overbaked and brittle. I eventually threw them all out because there was no way to reach the factory. I did buy a package recently when it was available in the supermarket. I feel somehow that the factory was happy to unload some unacceptable batches on an unwary customer."
3,Call of Duty 2 [Mac Download],Had lots of fun planing the game. Did have some performance issue on my iMac 2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4 GB 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM and ATI Radeon HD 2600 Pro 256 MB video.
4,Nice shooter,"The game plays great, sound effects and visuals are very good too. I haven't played the entire game, however until now the only thing which I think is missing is being able to choose the axis side, until now I've only played as an ally."
4,Amazing graphics and story line.,"I found this to be a fairly entertaining game on my Mac. The graphics during the game are really well done. Some minor glitches although very realistic. The small movie klips in the beginning of chapters are very well done and ensure you get an idea of the history of WW2. The surround sound is quite amazing as if you were on the war path, using head sets really helps the environment of the game. If you are into was games and enjoy first person shooting this game is for you. I played in the hard level and if you are no used to the mouse and keybrd combo get yourself a mouse. Also recommend you get a mouse with two button as a single button would be a disadvantage.Enjoy the game!"
1,Crashes on 2012 MacBook Pro,Frequent crashes on 2012 MacBook Pro with 8GB ram. COD 4 works great but COD 2 crashes more times than not.
1,This doesn't open on my Mac,This is worthless and it doesn't open... and apparently I can't get my money back. I bought it for my grandson and it never worked.
4,I Really Enjoyed The Game,Call of Duty 2 is a fun game. The weapons are not high tech but shows what was used in WWII. I enjoyed the different missions that the game posed. The only draw back is that I have a G4 and the game runs very choppy.
4,Buy This Game.,"This game is great. The campaign is better than average, the multiplayer never gets old (unfortunately!), and the price is not bad either, although, it is an old game. Letting you customize your controls is awesome because I couldn't stand the original ones. In multiplayer, you can use well over 25 different weapons, though not all of them are available at one time. Since every game has flaws and is not perfect, this game gets 4 stars, ****. Go buy it if you haven't already. Other than World at War, Call of Duty 2 is the best WWII Call of Duty made."
4,Call of Duty 2 Mac DVD,"Great gameplay, great graphics, overall awesome game. Takes a good amount of time to beat on Veteran, and very replayable. I have a Macbook 13"" white with Duo intel with intel graphics card and it handles the game perfectly, even though the chipset isnt supported (not nvidia or ati).The only problem for me was the multiplayer component. Loading times were terrible and I could never find a good server without waiting for 20 minutes for the server to download the neccessary packages. dont really play multiplayer now because it so boring to waitEverything else was good. If you like action and ducking behind oil barrels forever while the enemy surges all around you, this game is for you. Buy this game if you have a top Mac and you are playing around with Garageband and you are in need of some explosions"
4,"Greate game, BUT not up to date!","Call of Duty 2 is a great game, however the Mac versions are always behind in their updates compare to the Windows versions, which is frustrating to say the least. I got this game to play with my friends, but they are already up to the 1.3 update version on Windows and Mac still hasn't even got up to 1.2 as of today so we can't even play with each other over multiplayer. I just really wish Mac and Windows can release the games all at the same time."
2,Excellent...But Not Worth The Money,This is a tough call. I really like Leonhard's work and this is a work that I agree every professional should read. But the price is just outrageous! I've paid less for first editions of rare volumes by J.F.C.Fuller! If you want to save the money get this one through interlibrary loan. You can read it in about one or two sittings...longer if you are taking notes....But DO NOT buy this book...I believe in making a buck as much as the next guy...but the price on this is unconsciounable.
2,It is ok but ...,I think i kinda wasted my money by buying this thing. I have to plug it and wait for fish to see the light :) It is much more fun to talk to them to take the bait or just pray not to cathc a horse shoe crab. So if you like unimportant gadgets go ahead but fish are no fools anymore. They even know how many pounds of line you are using and even your age ;) so dont try to fool the fish and just fish. Good luck
5,"Listen once, listen 1000 times","I've been listening to this album for what... almost 20 years? It is one of those rare, rare, albums that you never, ever get tired of. A masterpiece!"
5,Kellye Gray CD,"This is not as good as ""Tomato Kiss"" but still terrific. Why doesn't she record more?"
1,W O R S T cd ever!!!!!,I am brazilian and I tought I could listen to this songs with my baby boy. I was wrong!!! This songs are not part of the brazilian culture. They are depressing. Brazilian songs are happy and full of life.I hate this CD. My baby is not listening to this.
2,Save your money and just buy the Latin Lullaby,"This was a remix of some of the songs on the latin lullaby CD which I thought was outstanding. However, I really liked the Latin Lullaby CD much more than this and would recommend only buying the Latin Lullaby...this ""Brazillian"" CD was just too similar and not as nicely done to bother buying."
5,Gorgeous music that makes you melt while your baby relaxes!,"Basically, our baby can not be without this CD! It has become completely indispensable in our household. We call it our ""secret weapon"" when we need to get our little guy to relax and sleep. He literally likes it to be played ALL night long into the morning when he wakes. And here's what I wasn't expecting: I can't be without it EITHER! This beautiful guitar music and the mesmerizing vocals absolutely melt you....all the stress of your day melts away. I'm just as addicted to this CD as my baby!"
4,Does the job - mostly...,"Works well, just has a rather limited light foot-print. Considerable adjustment is required to find the optimal position (not hiding the screen yet illuminating maximum keybord area). It appears to be well-made, excellent price, worth it!"
3,works,"Very flexible, works fine if you know how to type. If not, then this may not be bright enough. Just what I needed."
5,great!,My DH uses this when we are using video IM and he doesn't want to disturb the other guys by turning on a light. Hubby is deployed so I love being able to see his handsome face :)
3,One Good Month,"This item worked as advertized for the first month, then one of the LEDs began to flicker intermittently. Still useable, but agrivating. Good design. Plugs into USB port at back of notebook and is long enough to reach over the screen to light the keyboard--makes it completely out of the way. As others have indicated, it has limited light footprint, but is adequate for my use. I like the fact that it has a switch on the light head. Now looking for a way to disable the flickering bulb."
4,Georgia O'Keeffe,Good detailed book about her life and her career. I specifically like the excerpts of her letters.Though almost 600 pages is a bit long.
4,Fine album,"This is a great album. If you already own several of Kenny's albums then this will go nicely in the collection. However, if you are new to Kenny Rogers, or only want a hit's cd, ""ten years of gold"" or one of the other hit's collections is better."
2,Live by request remake bad. should not mess with the orginal,"My original cd , which got worn out from usage was excellent. When it was redone by the company, they left off many songs that were on the orginal. ""Why cheapen a good thing."" ? Kenney Rogers would be very upset if he knew what was done .Very disappointed in the remake. I think I will write a note to Kenney Rogers website telling him what happened to his cd, live by request He is by far the best artist I have met over the years."
3,Classic aviation film,You really need to be an aviation buff to appreciate the fine Spitfire footage and history. Entertaining and well-made for the time.
4,Superb acting by Leslie Howard,"As one would expect from the actor, Leslie Howard delivers another splendid performance. As with most of the early war films, there is some heavy-handed propaganda, but it's tolerable. England had been at war for three years and fought for its own survival. Historically, Hawker Hurricane fighter aeroplanes were more numerous and had taken a more active role in the defense of the Home Islands, while the beautifully-designed Supermarine Spitfire came to symbolize the strength of British resolve during those bleak and desperate times. According to author Edward Jablonski in ""Air War,"" Spitfire pilots often engaged the Messerschmidt fighters while the older, slower Hurricanes would ""... slaughter the bombers."""
1,MISLEADING PRODUCT,"Upon looking at the product listed, I believed that I was receiving a DVD. It was not. I didn't know if I could copy it or do something other than watch it on my pc. On a previous buy, a DVD on Bull Halsey with James Cagney, the only place it would play was on my pc. That was quite disappointing as well. Summary be careful what you purchase in record to DVD's. If the price is too good to believe..."
4,"Thin, comfortable headphones at the right price","I have been using these headphones for the past 8 years as I have a tendency to fall asleep listing to my mp3...currently a Zune. These are the flattest most comfortable headphones for this purpose.......much more reasonable than specialty items.....I also toss and turn and like the fact that they disengage on their own.......wrap arounds would not work for me. I have tinnitus and cannot use earbuds, which if you turn the wrong way........get imbedded in your ear canal.Downside..............this activity eventually will destroy the cabling at the connection to the headset. Current phones have lasted almost 9 months...I am hoping there was a prod mod to improve the termination. PS: They did fix it. I have been using the current set for 1 1/4 and they are still going strong. Hurray for PhilipsPlease do not ever take these out of production"
4,Good sound quality,"For this price I didn't expect to get anything special with regard to sound quality. However, I was positively surprised. Not at all muddy, and highs and lows are clear. Package advertised enhanced bass but the sound is actually quite balanced. Also rather crispy. Slightly uncomfortable to wear (doesn't adjust very well to the head) but that is a minor drawback. Definitely good and recommended for the price. From hifi point of view, passable at most but anyway lets one enjoy the music. Good for e.g. jogging if you prefer to leave your hifi gear indoors."
2,get what you pay for,"very weak, doesnt cancel out any noice. sound is kind of quiet. but you get what you pay for...."
4,Psychology field needs this,"This is the first of it's kind... lesbian widows. Grief is a taboo subject that most people are uncomfortable even acknowledging. Now you have two social taboos, together, in one book. The book has stories from several women whom have lost their partners for various reasons, and talk about what that experience has been like for them. It is powerful, educational, and a must read for anyone in the counseling field. But please have tissues handy, parts of this book really tug at the heart strings!"
2,No different then other books,This book does not say anything new that other web services books do not.
5,compelling weaving of evolutionary theory and forests,"Chatty and personal, but with very clear interweaving of evolutionary theory into his observations. For example, he suggests the trees are taller on the west coast because they do not have to deal with periodic hurricanes. Nice discussion of why trees are tall and the little plant's strategies to survive underneath them. The chapter on apical dominance explained how we come to have ""bush trees"", and much more."
2,"long on sentiment, short on science","This is the only Heinrich book I have read. I had heard really good things about him. But I was disappointed by this book. I wanted more ""this is how trees work and why they are such successful and unique organisms"", but I got a lot of ""it's nice and pleasant to take a walk in the forest""."
4,More Savannah Reid fun...,"In Death By Chocolate, Savannah Reid is hired to be a bodyguard for a TV cooking celebrity who is known for her chocolate recipes. But once Savannah meets her, she realizes that the lady is really a bitter old woman who is bossy and irritating. She's been receiving hate mail, and wants Savannah to figure out who is sending it. The investigation is barely underway when the Chocolate Queen is poisoned, and now Savannah has to figure out who killed her. And everywhere she turns, she finds people who fit the bill.To complicate Savannah's life, her sister Cordele shows up unannounced and wants to work out some ""family issues"" with her. Cordele can't seem to get past her ""horrible"" childhood, and wants to relive all her pain and agony, while Savannah just wants to send her back home.Light reading, fun story, and all the twists and turns you expect in a G. A. McKevett novel."
3,Interesting B-movie Film Noir,"An interesting little B movie film noir in which John Ireland, visiting an army buddy with his wife, finds himself battling a ruthless neighborhood gang of white supremacists. Notable for its gritty, working-poor setting and lots of dark, expressionist lighting. This work is also an example of how low cost B movies could tackle social issues that the studios of the day would never broach in a big budget release. Well worth the low price!"
4,"Highly optioned, price performer as described","As most people said the realty of this safe is that its heavy as heck but thats what you want in a safe containing the family jewels... Being waterproof and fireproof was high on my requirements, being digital and having neccessary back-up acess was even better. Two quick thoughts 1) ensure that you are home during the deliver scheduled time. The safe was deivered as promised without any damage. I wouldnt sign for it untill we checked it. The other reason you need to be home is that if allowed the delivery guys probably would have left it on the curb because it was so heavy. They wouldn't move it into the house (I even offered them money to do so) so the garage would suffice until I have an extra set of hands. 2) the wheels on the safe are a key feature to anyone who can't lift 175 pounds. Regarding placement - ensure its astable location the pounds per square inch of weight isn't something you would want sitting on most floors."
1,Poor,"Ordered this on 29 Nov. Product was not even made at the time, said I would have by 5 Dec. Item still has not shipped, will not make it for Christmas, but they didn't waste any time charging my credit card. Don't by this product."
2,Maybe fireproof but not really safe,"I drilled holes in this to bolt it to the floor. It, literally, took me two seconds to drill each hole through nothing but plastic lining and filler. Anyone with tools could break into it in no time. Hopefully, the fireproof part works better - hopefully, we never need it to. That said, it looks solid and is very heavy."
3,Seems like a good enough safe for the price,My safe arrived when scheduled. It took about a week. Packaging and box was in good shape and was packed well. This safe is fairly heavy. The shelfs are flimsy and the hanging file rack seems like waste. Seems heavy duty. Not sure about the plastic handle though...
2,Broken Wheel,"This safe is way too heavy for the two small plastic wheels that they put on it. They can do much better on this,My safe came with the wheels broken."
4,perfect for my needs,I searched for a long time and finaly decided to give this safe a try. It is mostly plastic but I do not care. I need something for document storage that was fire and waterproof . This one has nide rollers and a handle to help move it around
4,Good volume vs price value,"After researching a lot of fireproof and waterproof safes I chose this one. The free super saver shipping and no sales tax saved me over $100. There was a minor glitch in the manual concerning how to program a new combination, but a quick phone call to the manufacturer resolved that. Works great now."
5,First Alert 2092DF,"Delivery time was much shorter than expected so the safe was at the front door for 24 hours before being brought inside. UPS did an excellent job in shipping (no outer damage) and it was well packed. After unpacking and getting the correct setup instructions from the internet and allowing about 6 hours to warm up (sat in below freezing temp for more than 24 hours) I could not set a new combination. I left it for an additional 24 hours to warm up and all worked fine. Well worth the price.First Alert 2077DF Anti-Theft Safe with Digital Lock, 1.2 Cubic Foot, Gray"
1,Plastic only no Steel frame,"Watch out what you are buying!! This safe is out of plastic!! I needed to anchor it down and I drilled holes thru side and back. THERE IS NO STEEL!!! It is plastic only!!! I can cut thru with contractor's knife. It is outside plastic layer then fire isolation and plastic inside. It looks like toy from Walmart. My 7 years old daughter cut through with one of my cordless saw in few minutes. She opened it up like food can! I can not believe they call this ""SAFE"". In the documentation is statement ""Your new First Alert Waterproof Theft Safe will provide years of safe and secure protection for your valuables"" THIS IS A JOKE!! A 7 years old kid can go thru this ""TOUGH SAFE"""
5,serves as an easy to operate safe,"needed a safe place to store cash & important papers, computer HD backup, etc. wheels built in really make moving it easy, I recommend this."
5,Great Product,Very satisfied with this safe. Lots of space. I did follow another buyers review on how to set it up rather then follow the directions. Easy to set up for the first time.
3,This is a older model with no bolt down feature,"I bought thinking this safe has a bolt down feature. Model number for this safe is 2096DF. One I was looking for is ""2096DF-BD"". when I searched for the model number, link to this safe came-up and I ordered without reading all the details. This is an older model but a very good safe if you do not need a bolt down feature (based on my friend's experience). Since I wanted the bolt down feature, I return shipped it back to Amazon. I also found the safe with bolt down feature in Costco for much cheaper, which I bought."
3,Wouldn't buy a waterproof safe again,"Ok, so I realize this is an airtight safe, but according to First Alert that means you need to open it up once a month and let it air out. That is a major annoyance and sometimes I don't even remember. I put a bunch of important papers including my passport in the safe and the first time I opened it up they were all damp. My passport was almost ruined and had a horrible smell to it. If you contact First Alert they will mail you some silica gel packs for free to help minimize the moisture, but you still need to follow the 30 day air out procedure."
2,100% plastic safe,"i purchased this safe at lowes. the same price as here on amazon. i made a terrible assumption. i assumed that somewhere within the pretty plastic exterior a steel box existed. i was wrong. after drilling a hole in the back of the safe (so i could bolt it to a wall), my cheap drill bit went through the entire safe in less than 5 seconds.the packaging describes the safe as to be protective against fire, theft and water....maybe fire and water, but i would not put anything in here that you don't want stolen as it would only take a few minutes to drill or cut through this ""safe's"" exterior.would be good for an episode of david letterman's ""will it float"" but not for protecting valuables.just wanted to add 1 thing. if you do buy this safe, do not use the roller accessory attached (like a suitcase roller) to move the safe across your hardwood floors. if you do, you will get a pair of permanent thin tracks across your floor to forever remind you of the safe that really isn't."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I purchased this item obviously to protect my valuables and after less than six months of ownership the numerical number 3 makes a funny sound when you press it. Since my combination contains at least one number 3 in it, the safe tells me that I have entered the wrong combination and will not open. I have heard and read all about these press button combination pads and their vulnerability to fail, but I purchased one anyway and now I am paying the price for it. I guess you just can't purchase quality items anymore and I will never purchase another item made by ""First Alert"" ever again. Now I have to go through the entire hassle to convince the ""First Alert"" company that their combination pads are for junk and how do I get it fixed without it costing me an arm and a leg. I sure hope it's not a leg, because I only have one left!(Not a joke!)Don't waist your time on this product, keep looking and I hope you find one better than this ""First Alert"" garbage!"
3,Touchy to program,This safe meets my needs which is mainly for fire protection.The programing was frustrating until I remember a review from steel6 who explained how to program it.Now it works great.
4,Not bad for the money,I was pleasantly surprised at the space for the $ spent. Would like for it to be heavier though with the ability to bolt down without compromising the features of waterproof and fireproof.
4,Solid and uncomplicated,"I believe this product was everything I expected it to be when it arrived. It was a decent weight. And with the addition of some coins I'm putting in there, I think it will be pretty difficult to carry away if someone were to break into the house.One feature I could live without was this handle that raised so you could roll it like a suitcase. Yes, it might be difficult to move around...but isn't that sort of the point? If someone can carry it away and try to break into it on their own time, that would defeat the purpose.But otherwise, good size, versatile...easy to get into. I'm happy."
4,Our safe,"We found the safe to be all it advertized. We wanted a safe that was large enough to hold some coin books. We found this safe to be the largest one on the inside measurements. So far, after about a month it is working fine."
4,First Alert Safe,"This is a good, solid safe although the interior shelving is a little on the ""cheap plastic"" side. It will work well for cash and important papers."
5,great safe - arrived in good condition,we were hesitant to order based on feedback regarding shipping damage - but took the leap. Safe arrived in great condition and was packaged well.
2,Peace of Mind?,"I have been looking for a safe that is big enough but not pay a fortune. I found the First Alert 2096DF and seem to be what I wanted. I order the safe through Amazon because of the best price and the free shipping. We also like the fact that it has two locks, digital and the key. We were all excited to get it setup in our room and bolted in. Then came the head ache. We are having such a hard time setting up the code. It seemed like we did it right the first time but when we tried to open it with the code, never opened. We called the service line and they said it could be the batteries but nope. We had the safe for two weeks now and we still have not setup the code. It is too complicated or it's defected. I'm sure once we get the locks setup the safe will be fine. But for now it's giving us a head ache."
3,Nice Safe - Bad Setup Manual,"Let me say I really like the safe now that I have it set up. The only disappointment was trying to get it set up. The manual had a typo, where step 2 and step 3 were in reverse order. Well this typo means you would have ZERO chance of setting the access code. I struggled with this for about an hour. When I called for help it wasn't business hours. (24 hour assistance would be nice) So once I got First Alert on the phone and told them my issue they said ""oh, you must have the manual with the typo."" She explained what I needed to do and now I'm in good shape. Again, I really like the safe but it should have a manual that has been proofed."
4,First Alert Safe,This safe replaced a Sentry safe that I had for many years. I wanted a replacement that was easier to use so that is why I bought the digital version of this product. Digital is much easier to use than turning a dial. This safe has concealed hinges which would make it more difficult to open than one having exposed hinges. It came with two keys for use in case the batteries go dead. The only thing that I found to be a drawback was that the adjustable shelf was somewhat flimsy.
4,once you figure it out it's good,"My safe just arrived. The shipper was very good...even though they called me at 7:30 AM. Box arrived in fine condition. Managed to wrestle the safe out of the box without too much trouble. The documentation does leave something to be desired, but I did eventually set a passcode. Having the key override is a good feature.The cheap plastic innards do not allow the shelves or hanging file rack to slide in or out very easily. But I guess once you get them set up once you shouldn't have to do it again. I wish there was more choice with respect to where the shelves or rack can go.Overall I think it is pretty good for the price. I mainly wanted it for a bit of security and just in case there is ever a fire in my home. It's also good to collect important documents together."
2,shipping problems,Crumpled corner due to sloppy shipping. Inspect before you accept! I don't see how to bolt to the wall without compromising fireproof/waterproof characteristics. Seems easy to work and well made.
1,Garbage safe,"May protect your documents from a fire but that's about it. I can tear open this ""safe"" with basic hand tools."
4,"nice, but pricey and poorly sized","OK - I have about a 44 inch chest and a 34 inch waist. I figured an extra large would give me comfortable room, but after a couple of washes this thing is skin tight. I guess it could be an extra large for those 17-year old emaciated models Mr. Klein is so fond of. The fabric is very nice. Seems to collect lint though. I wanted something loose and comfortable to relax in."
3,way too tight,nice if you have a real tight body. it will expose every little fat you've got because the fit is way too tight. I recommend going 1 size bigger.
3,Sleeves and pants way too long,"It's made from modal which I understand doesn't shrink so if you want to hem them then they're nice and comfortable and look good too, however the sleeves and legs were at least 4 inches too long for me and a medium usually fits me perfectly 95% of the time. I sent them back. Jody Koval"
5,Excellent Product,"I was using Egyptian Cotton vests from India because I could not find comparable vests in US for the past 10 years. I bought this at Nordstrom last month and have now ordered more from Amazon. This is the best vest I have worn, it feels so snug, soft and nice on the body."
2,"It's decent, but not worth the price!","Pros:1. The shirt is comfortable.2. It holds its shape very well.Cons:1. It is thin. How thin? It is thin enough that you can almost read your computer screen through it.2. These shirts are not meant to keep you warm that's for sure.3. After a number of washings, there appears to be some slight pilling, but nothing to worry about it if you're wearing it as an undershirt.But for $32,... it's way overpriced. I don't think when I first bought these I paid that much for them. And now that I've had them for almost a year, I'm certainly not going to pay anywhere near that again. The price for these shirts should be $20 and not a dollar more.Buy one or two if you want to impress the ladies when it's hot outside. Otherwise, get yourself some Hanes, BVDs, or whatever and save yourself a chunk of change."
3,A word of caution:,"This is a tight, form fitted shirt. It's great if you have the body for something like that. very cool and very comfortable."
5,Drive an 80-ton heavily armed behemoth into battle!,"This is the game that set the standard for Giant Robot combat simulations. Expect to spend at least 2 hours learning to drive your mech, navigate, use your weapons, and manage heat build-up effectively. It truly captures the spirit of mechanized warfare, as you engage ground, air, and sea units. Once you master the mech, pound your enemy without mercy with weapons like the Gauss gun, autocannon, long range missile, and the mighty and impressive PPC! Stunning graphics truly drag you into this game, leaving you in a cold sweat wondering if there's a Timberwolf or Summoner waiting over the next rise to turn you into twisted limbs crushed under melting slag."
3,Sail On Software - Dishonest Company,"We ordered a new DVD through Amazon via Sail On. They sent us a used DVD (no packaging), which did not work. After stringing us along, we returned the DVD and were promised a replacement or refund. Needless to say, they have avoided our e-mails since. I would recommend NOT dealing with Sail On Software."
3,light entertaining read but light on content,"I thought the book was ok. There were some good inspirational thoughts, but nothing that was life changing. I read the book twice and then discussed one chapter a week with a group- so I pretty much squeezed almost all I could out of this book. It was a very fast, light, and easy read. This book has GOT TO BE one of the most graphic books out there. The paper, illustrations, layout - wow. (I would guess why this book is so expensive, but I loved the layout!). It was a good book - I just like deeper content."
5,most timely business book in years!,"innovation is it. very few big corporations get it; or if they get it, they seem able to do little about it. want know why? read Gordon MacKenzie's matchless Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool's Guide to Surviving with Grace. the rest of the book is as good - wise, witty - as the title. in short i think this is the best/most important business book to come along in many a year. it's a ""must read"" and a ""page turner"" - from someone who's been there (MacKenzie spent decades in creative posts at Hallmark). i have given over 25 copies to friends!"
5,A book by somebody who has been there.,"There are many books on corporate creativity but very few of them are written by creative people who actually worked in corporations. MacKenzie's description of both his successes and failures in, and slightly outside of, the hairball have that ring of truth. Its not like you can duplicate his journey, each ascent is up a different mountain, but it is really helpful to know what pick-axes he used in the climb. It is also a beautifully designed book with great drawings and pictures. It has become my first choice for a Hallmark Card."
5,a must read for everyone in leadership,"This is a delightfully playful book which gets to the core of employee motivation, innovation and involvement. Via great anecdotal stories and illustrations Gordon MacKenzie captures how corporate management culture easily evolves from being innovative and enabling to being obstacle ridden and rule bound. I've given over 30 copies to my direct reports."
5,"Brilliant, hopeful and helpful","If you work a creative job or are pushing for change within a large company, this is an excellent book. This book was reccomended to me by our CEO as a management book I and thought I'd better grab a copy before I met with her. I bought it at a B&N in the real world, and ended up not leaving the parking lot for an hour because it was so fascinating. I'm very leery of management books, but this one is a beautifully non-linear and chaotic version of a management book. In other words, it's much like the real world. It can be read front to back, or grabbing chapters randomly. Either way, there's much that is inspiring and useful, especially if it's a book that's being embraced at a senior management level within your company. If not, it makes an excellent gift! I've returned to purchase 4-5 copies because I keep giving away mine to share the message with people in the company and in my team."
2,If Tom Robbins wrote a business handbook,"Judging by the evidence of this book, Gordon MacKenzie is a twinkling, Merry Prankster-esque holy fool, a cubicle-farm Patch Adams, out to shake up the grey-carpeted halls of corporate America with his own blend of studiedly random wackiness. As other reviewers have said, there is little in the way of practical, take-away advice in this book, and that might well be how MacKenzie wants it -- telling people how they should be is such an authority trip, man. But it leaves you with very little in the end, other than MacKenzie's self-satisfaction and a lot of fake-amateurish scribbling and marginalia. A few nuggets float to the surface here and there; I noted with interest how he told a group of timid executives to ""make marks"" on paper instead of draw on it, as ""drawing"" prompts anxiety in people not used to acting creatively. If MacKenzie could've deigned to offer a little more in that vein, this would have been a valuable book."
1,"Blah, blah, blah",Wish I could give this book a zero. There's no THERE there. Do not waste your time or your money.
1,I would not recommend this seller to anyone,I gave it a 1 star but it should have been a 0 stars. I never received the book. I sent 2 emails and received no response. I hope this does not show up on my credit card.
5,WOW!,"Creative, fun and insightful. Gordon Mackenzie provides you with a survivor guide for the corporate rat race."
5,Very funny and a quick must read for creative corporate types,"Illustrations are beautiful, the chapters short and very entertaining. A must read for creative corporate souls."
3,"good, but not quite what I was expecting","I enjoyed the book, but more as a storybook than as a creativity handbook or survival guide. The techniques that it offered were often vague. The illustrations and layout were playful and fun though. I think the book works best as an inspiration source rather than a guidebook."
5,thinking outside the box,"Found in the buisness section, yet inspiring in every day life. Truly an example on how to make the most of any sitiuation. Positive and uplifting, fun to read, the illustrations are captivating.A good addition to any library."
3,Quite interesting,"This book is interesting reading: I can mirror my own ""corporate warrior's"" experience. It is written in a bit different way than traditional management books. The choice of words is sometime difficult or strange. Amusing. Some sentences are so dense of meaning that I choose to use them our of their context to reflect."
2,Not for Everyone,"I'll first admit something about myself; I'm not a creative person in the traditional sense. I can be very creative, but only in the sense that that I'm able to think outside the box to solve a problem. I have very little urge to create for the sake of creation.I think if you have the urge to be creative and want to leverage that to advance your career AND you have a job role that would benefit from that ability then this might be very useful for you."
2,Confused? What do I do?,I am very depressed. I have been with a guy named Gary for 3 1/2 years. We live together. We just broke up. He was my first love. He said that we can work things out. How can can we work things out if we are not together?
1,No Soul Within,Lackluster production;Naive lyrical commentary; musical ineptitude.Where is the soul/R&B promised?Very disappointing.
2,Too Stiff for Me,I gave this hair spray away because it didn't provide a flexible hold. I had to wash it out to be able to comb through my hair.
5,expensive but worth it,"If you are a phoneticists, you need this book. Nearly every important contribution to the field is covered. Chances are if you know what this book is, you need it."
1,Not worth the purchase.,"I'm quite disappointed with this book. I have been diligently reading it for the last week. At first, I noticed an abundance of typos. I just finished reading the OSPF chapters. Too much effort is wasted trying to figure out what the author is trying to say. The typos are now showing up in very critical areas. Information isn't consistent. After spending a very long time trying to understand the material, I realized that it was the authors presentation and typos that I was trying to work through not the actual material. Rather than waste anymore of my time, I'm going to purchase another book and start again."
3,Worst book in CCNP Exam Guide Set.,"First of all there're errors and typos in this book, especially in the example and figure. The style of writng is wordy and not direct to the point. However, it covers all CCNP exam topics. I think that it's better to read ""Routing TCP/IP vol.1 & 2"" which cover everything you need."
2,"Not the best, but it did help","This book made so much more sense to me only after I read Todd Lamels CCNP Routing book. It has about the same info., but Todds books are so much clearer and easier to read. This book just jumps from one thing to another, it does not flow. I used this book for the new BSCI exam, I know it dosn't cover IS-IS and yes IS-IS is heavily tested on the exam, I got at least six questions. I would suggest using this book as only one of your resources. there were at least three questions I can think of that I could only find the answers in this book. I have passed two exams so far using these three resources: Todd Lamels books, Cisco press books (as a Reference),and Boson practice questions."
4,I liked it,"I thought it was a pretty good book. I used this book and a few cisco whitepapers, and I passed the first time. I thought it covered each topic more than well enough to pass the test."
2,This book is by NO means from hard work,"I totally agree with folks that gave the criticism to this book before me. The book is1. Full of typos and errors! An incredible and inexcusable number of them have been seen here and there. I've been in US for several years and have NEVER ever seen any book, any book published in this country with that many mistakes!2. Written in obscure British English. I really don't understand why they picked an Englishwoman to do this job. The English she uses in this book is technology-wise non-standard and unclear.My conclusion is, you grab any CCIE in Silicon Valley who is conscientious for his job and speaks American English and he/she can do a much better job than Mr. Gough. The book is NOT worth to buy."
2,disappointing quality,"For a book endorsed by Cisco, and specifically targetted for preparing CCNP, you would expect good quality, at least I was. Unfortuneately, it is not like that. The book has some good points, like the quick quiz before each chapter, and the comprehensive answeres and notes. However, when you look at the example configurations and the corresponding diagrams carefully, most of time, they are messed up. Just look at the Chapter 9 example 9-5 and figure 9-9, and its corresponding text!Hopefully, a revision will make this book more useful.BTW, I do like some Cisco books, like ""routing TCP/IP"" by Jeff Doyle, but not this one."
5,must use this!,excellent and well paced the cd covered the material very well.I recommend for any routing 5 students or pre ccnps.
2,"ok, not great","This was the 3rd CCNP exam I took and I used the Cisco study guides for each. I'd agree with some of the others before me in saying this was the weakest of the Cisco series. It's not bad, but definitely not great either. I was particularly frustrated with a BGP Local Preference example that was given which was completely wrong. I spent 45 minutes at the bookstore searching other guides to verify. In fact, I ended up spending quite a lot of time with the Osborne/Syngress press book and liked it a lot. I would definitely recommend that book. I basically read all of the BGP chapters and most of the OSPF chapters and found them very comprehensive."
4,"Covers the exam, could use a few updates.","You have passed the CCNA exam and are ready to tackle the CCNP certification. You have decided to start with the Routing exam but you are not sure of which book to get. Since the exam is Cisco based then the choice should be Cisco Press.Within the pages of the Routing Exam Guide the author takes the reader on a detailed path to routing.

5,A very good protein supplement.,I ordered the natural flavor because most flavored drinks are too sweet for me. The good quality of this protein and small amount for a normal dose of it [30 ml.] makes it is a good deal for the price. I like it and will reorder more in the future.
3,just basics,This is SHORT & QUICK biography about O.W. It covers the very basics.If you did some research you likely know more then what is in this DVD. This is not the deep biography fans of O.W. are looking for. Though it would be OK to use for english classes.If you are interested to see a movie with good representation of O.W. Get the 'Lillie' DVD. A biography about Lillie Langtree. Oscar was her close personal friend and is well represented in this film.
3,"Interesting, but far from original","The book will certainly introduce you with many interesting ideas and theories on human nature and society. However, it won't give you much, if you are already familiar with classical writers and philosophers like Stendhal, Balzac, Nietzsche, Pascal, Dostoevsky and others.It is not that he 'peppered' his explanations with their examples as the other reader noted; I rather had a feeling that Elster simply reviewed their writings with only few original thoughts added.I would rather recommend buying original works as you would gain much more from them than from this abridged review of everything."
5,"""The only good novel about a fighter that I've have ever "" -Hemingway. Now I see why.","Great book. Heinz used his knowledge of sports writing to supplement trying to talk about what a fighter is thinking. It made the book a lot less cheesy and a lot more honest. The parallel between what Eddie was going through as a fighter and the sportswriter's interpretation of it created an accessible, believable look at the boxing game. That is why I believe Hemingway gave it the credit he did. Heinz wrote with skill and made a very enjoyable read for any boxing fan. I would highly recommend to anyone who is at all interested in boxing."
2,Bland,"I'm not sure what the rest of you are talking about. I thought there was so much unlocked potential in this subject. There were so many opportunities for interesting settings, and intriguing minor characters. The sparring partner 'Memphis' was pretty cool and the trainer Doc Carrol was alright. Eddie the fighter seemed without a personality at all to me. I guess I missed something."
2,average but interesting,"finally got around to watching this DVD Recently&it had some moments,but it was just a ok film.I dug the comedy&drama going back&Forth but the film kinda went on a bit too long.still it had a few cool moments."
3,The Hepburn,"As reward for his loyalty to James Stuart, valiant Patrick Hepburn won as his wife prou, beautiful Jane Gordon, the one woman in all Scotland whom he could not subdue! Don't miss this new thriller by the author of THE BORDER LORD."
5,ARROW DYNAMIC SOUND Davie Allan & The Arrows,"If you do not have this LP/CD in your house or car then you ain't livin' life right!Get out your cash and get it!If you are a guitarist watch out because this guys playing will make your guitar whimper and crawl back into it's case!Davie Allan is the most best kept secret about to be discovered by a new legion of guitar maniacs and to us who have known ""na na na na nah"" we've had him for a while!Eat your heart out!!Yep ....up untill him you've been listening to a lesser guitarist!Every song is killer!Everything he ever did is!Get it all!"
1,Screwed up my drum - Don't trust,"Ordered it, got it, installed it - then streaks started after the first print. Took the toner back, bought another brand, and now my drum is screwed up."
1,how many holes are in this Harmonica? This info. is ESSENTIAL!,"This info. is important, I would have purchase this Harmonica in seconds had I known..Please Email Me! Thnank You! ..Phil"
4,Video in and Video out at a reasonable price,Great little card for the $$$$. With the video in you can copy tv shows or movies from your vcr in the vcd mode save them to your hard drive and burn them to disc that will play on most dvd players.The video out is also very useful for viewing your digital pictures on your large size tv.All this for just 79 bucks. Too bad they are no longer avaliable.
3,It's okay... not more than that.,"I have just gotten a new p3 933 pc. With it i got the ATI rage fury pro 32 meg video card. It Has many advantages, like cd player and dvd player, but the sounds aren't all that great. I'd rather use windows media player to watch movies and listen to cd's. Also, my video card has a very hard time supporting 1024x768 and 1280x1024 on both my desktop, and games. It either gets somewhat blurry, or slows down a lot. I have noticed that movie cinematics do not display too well either, (for some games, they display well). Although, this card is very fast with 800x600 display, and it displays non-cinematics in games very well."
4,Fender SKB Molded Standard Dreadnought Case Review,"I had purchased a Fender Villager 12-String Acoustic and discovered afterward that finding a case or gigbag to fit would be a challenge because of the unusually long headstock. I read in a blog that this case might be an option, so I ordered it. I had to remove the molded interior, fold back the cloth material at both ends, then make cuts at both ends to allow the guitar to fit in the case. I used contact cement to glue the material and the bottom of the molded interior back in place. The end result is that I now have a case that looks like it was made for this guitar. Under the circumstances it was the best and most economical solution."
3,"Perfect War Story, Then Downhill","The first half is brilliant. Just is inspired by Hemingway, but transcends Hemingway, he is better than Hemingway. Then, when the story is heading towards its climax, he drops the ball. Yet, Just is a master, and, despite its flaws, Stringer remains worthwhile."
5,Great Guitarist,"Emily was considered (and still is by many of us) a great Jazz Guitarist, and here on her last CD, she sounds so fresh, so straight ahead, and to my delight; so Brazilian Jazz.For years I'd only heard the song ""E Samba"" but came to realize that many other cuts featured Brazilian Jazz hues which I assume Emily loved; cuts besides ""E Samba"" like: ""You Know What I'm Saying"", ""Around the Bend"", ""Carenia"" and ""Simplicidaje"" are absolutely great and very innovative; still up-to-date.Her guests on this her last CD were:- Emily Remler / Guitar & Guitar Synthesizer- Russ Freeman / Keyboards and Programming- Jimmy Johnson / Bass- Duduka Da Fonseca / Drums- Romero Lubambo / Acoustic Guitars- Bill O'Connell / Piano- David Benoit / Piano- Luis Conte / Percussion- Cafe / Percussions- Lincoln Goines / Bass- Maucha Adnet / Vocalsetc.etc.If you definitely are into great Jazz Guitarists, this Emily CD must be in your collection."

4,My kid likes Bullwinkle!,"Hard to find a Bullwinkle and Rocky shirt nowadays, bought a dark navy one from Lands End (they have good quality/good price) online and then ironed this one on. Has held up well, and my son likes having the little patch. I Netflixed the Rocky&Bullwinkle series for him (did you know you could do this?) and he loved it! Cute patch, nice and thick sewing."
2,This is a fairly basic overview of car detailing,"I found this video to be mediocre and the the video quality was so so. I bought it mainly for learning about buffing but I found out after buying it discusses cleaning the engine, interior and wheels. I was hoping it would discuss the different types of buffing pads to use and a discusion about the different types of compounds. The video only discussed three meguiar buffing chemicals and did not discuss buffing pads at all. It didn't even discuss buffer speed. There was only about 5 minutes of discussion on buffing. The section about interior cleaning was a complete waste. The paint video from meguiars which cost $10 was a little bit better than this video."
2,Not even an ADEQUATE Introduction!,"I'm sorry to say that this video completely misses the mark. In his attempt to target the mass market, the author fails to reach any audience at all. The video shows how to use a handful of Meguiar's products, but Meguiar's offers better quality information and how-to videos on their own site. Frankly, you could assemble a better video from YouTube clips. For a better range of video how-to information, visit Autogeek!"
2,Disappointed.,"The clock broke within a week of having it outside. I love the look, but not very functional."
3,"First your kicked, then it tows","A few great tracks where this daring doom duo of violins and drum properly align contains all the real power inherent in the best of the bloated Godspeed side-work, but these poignantly minimal workouts are offset by large clusters of dead air, lending to a confusing experience."
5,Number Six is good Pix,"Once again, Star Wars Tales franchise delivers. Being a star wars fan since the original movie opened (I was 7) has caused me to want to search out all kinds of books, comics, and magazines. Dark Horse has done a great job finding good writers and even greater illustrators to make these unique stories come alive. These stories will stretch the imagination and give new twists and views on characters in the Star Wars universe. I have enjoyed these stories emensely."
2,That Natasha could have put her name to this.........,"....is embarrassing. My opinion of Natasha is well recorded in these pages...cute...sexy...good, clear voice...inoffensive lyrics...a real doll...But.............Whoever did this remix needs to get another line of work. What we have here is short [7'43""] even for a single. Two versions of ""Single"", the one from the album, which is fine, a catchy tune, even if it isn't my personal favorite, and a remix that REALLY grates on the nerves.Natasha, I still love you, and I'm glad you didn't put out a bunch of singles for your second album like you did for ""Unwritten"". Natasha is who I listen to when I want harmless relaxation...she is a treasure. But, alas, the singles from her first album are still around to remind her that we all make mistakes."
2,Not very good,"Bedingfield has a distinctive voice, although it is kind of reminiscent of Mel C of the Spice Girls or Sophie Elis Bexter. She's no Beyonce and neither is she Christina...she's Kylie for the more mature listener...one that thinks she's black possibly.Her success is a fallout of her brother's and primarily in her looks. Her music is incredibly bland and forgettable. Why people like it so much, I just don't know. Perhaps they are deaf? Or maybe I am? Who knows.Bedingfield should've been a psychologist (didn't she study psychology or something?) At least then she could've helped me.Don't waste your money on this CD. Just go the whole hog and buy Kylie's. I don't think Minogue has any talent at all, but at least one no talent and mediocrity is better than two.All in all, I shall give Bedingfield two stars, as her voice is different--alas, not very powerful--but different."
5,Smooth texture and flavor; great value,"For two years, I've eaten no sweeteners of any kind. I've tried many different kinds of 100% cacao or 99%, with the remainder being vanilla, as in the case of Scharffenberger. They are never cheap. The biggest drawback generally is bitterness or a rough texture. You can ease the bitterness somewhat by adding creamy fats, such as coconut butter or heavy whipping cream, but the lack of sweetener is always noticeable -- even to me, after I've lost the taste for sweetness.For the price, this is by far the best pure chocolate I've tried. It's smooth and glossy, breaks apart with a pleasing *snap*, and has much less bitterness. My baked goods and mousse-type desserts have been much smoother; they are rich without being harsh. If this is the case with zero sweetening, then I suspect that this chocolate will be a big winner for all other baking."
5,She's all that,"Machine-age mysticism informs Sandra Collins' darkly luxurious grooves on this Cream compilation. Hits all the right notes of ""Apocalypse Now"" end-credits menace that really good prog-house can bring, without missing the proper sense of silvery euphoria. Cool but never cold, this mix is unfailingly sophisticated, densely wrought, body-thumping, and, as is often said of Collins' musicmaking, ""gorgeous."" Indeed a very classy act-- the most satisfying compilation I've seen in forever. Terrific candy for the ear and the rear."
3,great tees,"I would rate a 5 because they are simple, well made cotton tees with a little longer sleeve which I really like - also great range of colors. Only, problem is that there is an expensive shipping price applied to each tee that doesn't quite make it a great deal, hence the 3 rating."
5,Love these soft shirts!,"I have very sensitive skin and often feel claustrophobic in my clothes and they have to come off right then. These shirts are roomy, non-binding, low necked and with soft seems inside, enough to be very comfortable...and I love the fabric. I have to wash everything before I try it on - a big problem - so I just washed and dried one for starters. It came out perfect! The size and shape didn't change a bit and they were a bit softer, too. The color didn't fade nor change at all. They are made of preshrunk cotton so they wouldn't be shrinking anyway but sometimes the shape can change if they weren't cut on the straight grain of the fabric - these were perfect in quality and construction. I'm ordering a few more!!!"
1,not as described,this shirt was not as described. it was a regular t shirt not qa scoop neck with 3/4 sleeve as shown and it shrinked dramatically
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"To get the liquid of your choosing into this unit, you'll need a funnel and about 5-10 minutes to sit/stand there slowly filling it up, because the hole is so small. If you're filling it up with bug killer, your eyes and nose will be killing you by the time it's close to filled up. HORRIBLE design! Do NOT buy this!!!"
3,Good premise wasted by lack of closure,"The first few chapters of this book give us an interesting set up, perhaps one or two too many characters, but some promise nonetheless. But about halfway through the novel, the reader keeps waiting for something significant to happen. It never does. I would like to know if the author intended the book to end this way when he began or if he painted himself into a corner."
3,"Focus, Mr. Lennon. Focus.","My sentiments echo many of the others here. The crisp prose in the first 125 pages or so of this book had me enraptured. I felt as though I was in the car with those boys when they were driving away from the airport, heartbroken and shocked. But as the story wore on, it lost its focus. Too many words were devoted to seemingly unimportant situations and characters. I put the book down before I got to page 200, and I don't plan on starting up again. It just goes to show you---you can't polish a turd. Even with a writing style and command as exceptional as Lennon's."
2,Curiously cold and inert,"This synopsis of this novel makes it sound as if it would be moving and contemplative. It's unfortunate that it was staid and boring. The characters' confusion frustrated me because I couldn't understand it and they didn't move forward. They just wallowed in this muddled despair and stayed in it. Plus, the failed attempts at closure for the characters was completely lost on me.Ultimately I just found this book boring and completely without suspense."
3,Disappointing,I was hooked from the first paragraph: The author has uncanny insight into how real people think and feel and a talent for making you care about his characters. But the book does not deliver on its promise. Lennon fails to resolve all but one of the many haphazardly intertwined relationships -- almost as though he dug a hole he couldn't write himself out of. Tremendous potential but I felt cheated by its ultimate pointlessness.
3,It could have been so much more.,"The book had so much potential that I felt it just never lived up to. It would have made a great short story had it just focused on the old man and his story. After finishing it, the book felt like a collection of 4 or 5 short stories, only one of which was completed. The author started to intertwine the characters but didn't quite do it. So much was started in this book and never finished.While I thought the author could have done more, I did enjoy the plot that was established. It is quite and interesting idea, I just think it could have been done better."
2,I wanted to throw this book out the window,"Okay, I understand that this is a first novel and indeed the writer was in his twenties when he wrote it, but all I can say is: it shows! The first chapter was great, but it went way down hill from there. I just didn't buy the characters. It was clear to me that this writer has not experienced even half of what he writes about (the death of a parent, a divorce, estrangement from one's children, the loss of a lover in a sudden accident). I am not saying that a writer must always write from autobiography in order for it to be good, but a writer certainly must be able to convey the human truths of these events if he expects anyone to read this as anything approaching quality fiction. There were many moments that I admired. Lennon may have some wonderful books ahead, but this one, I wanted to throw it out the window."
2,"Like its characters, this tale lost focus and direction","Based on the premise, I really thought I'd love this book -- and after the first few pages, I was sure I would. But it lost focus and direction. Characters were introduced and dropped -- for no apparent reason. I wasn't looking for a happy ending, but I was looking for some sense of closure. The book doesn't have any. I can only say if it was a gimmick setting up the premise for a sequel...I'm not interested."
1,Forget This One,"I was really bummed after reading this book. It was to slow and did not seem real. It drove me crazy reading chapter after chapter about someone different. There were several main characters, that by the time I got to a chapter about them, I forgot who they were and where they left off."
5,Very absorbing and thought-provoking,"I was completely caught up in this book the minute I opened it. It took me one weekend to read it, and even though I was initially put off by the subject matter (plane crash), I'm so glad I stuck with the book. I thought the characters were so well-written, especially Lars, and the stories were nicely intertwined. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book a 10 was the fact that I was a little confused and unconvinced about how quickly some of the characters were able to ""move on"" after the plane crash. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone--it's a great read."
4,Thoughtful and restrained,"Lennon presents one of today's most televised tragedies -- an airplane crash -- and brings the reader into the intricacies of what happens when life ends for so many people. So thoughtful and introspective -- not at all what you would expect from a book that could be described as ""the aftermath of a plane crash on a small town in Montana."" My only complaint is that with so many characters to juggle, some felt underutilized. Bring Lars back for a sequel of sorts! I look forward to reading Lennon's latest, The Funnies."
5,Sexy Rock 'n Roll is the new Rock 'n Roll,"That's right, good music is coming back. Thanks to Noah and his team of beautiful boys we can all put on some glitter and have FUN!"
4,confortable fit and adequate sound,"I bought these in-ear headphones to replace the underwhelming ear pods that came with my RCA Lyra. The philips are comfortable to take on and off, and can be worn with the head piece at different levels on your head. While the bass is nothing spectacular, it does the job for my needs and the treble is not the tinfoil variety I got from some ear buds I've tried. Well worth the price I paid."
3,dull video,"After seeing the dabke performed, I looked forward to learning it as well as other fun, high-energy folk dances. Well, the mood of this DVD wasn't very fun - actually, the 2 women in the background dressed in very drab clothes accompanying one man like he was their guru gave off kind of a creepy vibe. Maybe the technical instruction on these dances is good, and Nagi seems to have good credentials. I just didn't feel inspired to dance by his lessons."
2,"Fun for experts, off-putting for beginners","Ironically, the ""Introducing"" books always seem to be least useful for those who really need an introduction. Introducing Postfeminism (an awkward term if ever there was one) is no exception - it's overly stylish and short on transitions, organized paragraphs, and clear explanations of specific figures and ideas. If you already have a solid grounding in these matters, the book may be a handy pocket reference - however, as an actual introduction it's a mess. The ideas jump off the page in the worst kind of buzzworded style, and we're scarcely five words into essentialism when structuralism barges into the picture. Even a reader eager to learn (me) finds hirself skimming."
1,Big time damage,"The valve was working ok for a year, and this week a crack happened in the written part of the connection PVC pipe and sent water everywhere. I have it installed to control the water of the jacuzzi in an apartment building, and my neighbors got their apartment flooded big time. I'm still working on the damage cost, but I already have over $5000 in bill to pay because of the damage. Next time I will buy a honeywell metal valve."
1,Check them as soon as you get them,Check them before you install them. I bought 5 of these for my sprinkler project. 3 had cracked solenoids (at the base of the solenoid on the threads) and one had a bad valve. I don't know if I just got a bad lot but 1 out of 5 is ridiculous.
3,This book combines the Christian Life with Psychoanalysis,"The Becomers examines the problems of living the Christian life from a layman's view of psychonanalysis, specifically from Freud's theories. It would be most useful to pastors, councilors, and other lay leaders hoping to understand the natural change process so that they can help their parishioners grow spiritually. Individual Christians may also find it helpful. My rating of a 6 is based on the author's admission of oversimplifying Freud and on a personal preference toward a more hands-on approach to Christianity"
4,GOOD TEXAS BOY,"THE ALBUM IS EXPLICIT, BUT IT REALLY HAS SOME TIGHT TRACKS. YOU CAN HEAR A SAMPLE FROM THE DEEP SOUTH TYCOON WEBPAGE. ....."
3,"FAST Shipping, Boring Conan book.","I am a avid Conan reader. However i found this book EXTREAMLY hard to get into. It started very slow and maintained that pace well past half of the book. I finally get tired and decided not to finish the book. Out of 9 Conan books, this is the worst one. Its better to stick with Howard or Jordan for good Conan books."
2,Two Plot Lines: One Boring; The Other So-So,"Carpenter is not one of my favorite Conan authors, but the way this tale started off I thought I might have a different opinion of him in the end. But not so. In one story arch, Conan is living off the land, drawing on all his survival skills in the wilderness, sort of like Les Stroud in ""Survivorman"" on Discovery Channel. This, I thought, is a great idea for a story setting. It fizzles when Conan meets a forest maiden and basically settles down and gets married! Conan's relationship with this maiden is not keeping in character with the Conan created by Robert E. Howard. The other story arch is about a girl, her god-possessed doll and her rise to queen of Brythunia. It is pretty dull, cliche in many ways. The archs intersect in the last few pages. It's not an anticlimax, but it's not a terrific climax either. It just sort of happens. Then it's over. You won't hate this book, you won't love it either."
2,DanR.D.,"Firefox and Thunderbird GarageBook Out of Date, and not too relevant to today's program- Firefox and Thunderbird Garage by Chris Hofmann Paperback"
2,Not as advertised,"This filter was supposed to be like a ""HEPA"" filter for a cool mist humidifier. Despite sanitizing my entire humidifier before using this filter, the filter molded over with fuzzy green and black mold within 6 weeks. The regular filter that came with my humidifier was made to last 8 weeks, and it never molded.This is not as advertised.However, I do like the metal mesh instead of a plastic mesh, because it's easier for me to recycle, now that I've had to throw out the filter.I will not buy this again."
4,"Amazing Production, So so Raps","I would giv this record a 5 if i loved the rapping, which is ok, but kindof hard to understand and very mumbled at times. The AMAZING thing about this record is the prodution!!! The beats are all thick and super warm. The samples and music on all of these songs are very unique, creative, and have alot of feeling. Alot of hip hop/rap songs dont really go anywhere musically, have a great beat, but just have the same music and beat throughout the entire song, but not on here. Most of the songs start out with a really basic, simple beat that progresses into heavier beats, dark bass lines and Radiohead'esque keyboard and guitar samples.I love the music on this record, but i feel like it totally outshines the voice and the rapping, making the vocals just seem like something you have to put up with to be able to enjoy the tunes."
1,Awful...painfully awful,"No matter how bad you want to believe that this is creative or innovative or what not, IT'S NOT.This album is abstract, but not in a creative way. This Sole guy just talks with no rhyming to some kind of lame buzzing ""beat""(I don't even want to call it a beat). There is no comncept of rhythm, no flow, nothing!Now I know that there are thousands of suburban teenagers who think that listening to this type of music makes them ""interesting"" or ""hip"" or something. But the reality is that this is just a talentless dude trying to survive off the support of such pretentious people."
1,Not feelin it,"This album left me disapointed, and i really think sole is wack. He is an emcee that can't rhyme...literally. So I thought this album was wack."
1,Pseud's Corner continued,"To paraphrase Mark Pytlik, who expresses himself far more eloquently than me on the matter (see allmusic.com `Selling Live Water' review): Like most Anticon records, Sole's Selling Live Water plays a disingenuous trick on the listener by selling itself as high-concept when it's really hip-hop Dada. For all its dense, breathless wordplay and thick, stewy production, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there's a surfeit of content here, threads to untangle, layers to peel through. The disappointing reality is that all these five-dollar words and murky sonic tapestries are impressionistic at best, a fact that wouldn't be in the least bit troubling were Sole's more lucid moments not filled with blazing rhetoric in deference to some sort of hidden insight."
4,raw & inventive,"Think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set. 'Selling Live Water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats. Sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun. He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'. Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'."
3,Voices of the Dream,"I was looking for books to show children examples of works of art when teaching. While this book has a nice sampling of works in various media from nine artists ranging from Elizabeth Catlett to Samella Lewis and Faith Ringgold the images are a little small averaging only about three or four inches. Having purchased it in hardback at a serious discount through the ""used and new"" option I'm not that disappointed, though it would have been nicer if the book and the images within were larger."
3,Just ok.,If you like Richard Pryor and have seen all his movies then you may as watch this one too. The plot wasn't the best and he wasn't as funny as he usually is. You wouldn't miss anything if you didn't watch it though.
5,"The movie which inspired Eddie Murphy's ""Nutty Professor"" movies",I have loved this movie for years. I was so glad to see it on DVD. Pryor plays 3 different roles in this funny movie. He does a fantastic job. I always laugh through this whole movie & the theme song rocks. Well worth the money!
4,Richard Pryor Fan,"If you like Richard Pryor, you'll love this DVD. Pryor plays three different characters in ""Which Way is Up"" and every character is a riot! His interaction with the children in ""Bustin' Loose will have you in stitches! The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because of ""Brewster's Millions"", which I did not find quite as funny as the other three movies. Three great and one decent Richard Pryor movies all on one DVD---you can't beat it for the price."
5,Richard Pryor at his Best!,"To heck with Tom Keough and Leonard Maltin! ""Which Way Is Up?"" is Richard Pryor at his comedic best. It is funnier than all of his other movies combined!He is able to showcase his talents, without having to play ""sidekick"" or ""buddy"" to a less talented actor.I found myself laughing until I was in pain at some of the jokes.See Which Was Is Up?, and experience the type of humor that Martin Lawrence, Eddie Griffin, Steve Harvey, and the Wayan Brothers could only dream about creating!The Man is a genius!"
3,Nostalgic & still funny,"This movie is classic Richard Pryor.I remember seeing this movie back when it first came out. I laughed myself silly at the antics of the three different characters Richard Pryor portrayed. This was way', way, before Eddie. Murphy created the Klumps.This is the type of movie that you just sit back & let roll. It doesn't require you to think about the plot or character motivation etc. It's definitely dated but that's part of it's charm. The main character gets himself into a scrape with the locals & has to leave town when they threaten him & force a bus ticket out of town on him.If you're a Richard Pryor fan then you'll want this movie in your collection."
4,Good service,I bought the book new so it was no surprise that it was in excellent condition but I had not realized beforehand that the delivery time was within one to almost three weeks from the date of purchase so I was a little impatient by the time I received it. A good experience overall but I wish it had been delivered within less time.
4,Great introductory and practical book,"My life would have been way easier if I had read this book while in college. It has what many other books lack, and that is explanations on how to carry out the different estimation methods in commonly used software packages such as E-Views and RATS. As for its contents, it has an excellent coverage on the topics that concern those who work with financial time series. It is a good summary of the econometric techniques used for high-frequency data. The explanations are simple and clear and it has a very practical approach. I would only add to this book a CD with the time series with which the estimations were run."
4,"Excellent book, True to name","I would recommend this for beginners not only in econometrics, but also who do not have much knowledge in Maths or need a refresher along the way. This book is the best for introduction, the most user accessible text on this topic I know of. For example, it even explains what a trace of a matrix, so that one does not have to back and forth between books."
3,Funny book....but not that great otherwise.,Lewis Grizzard is a funny guy. But I thought the book was lacking in so many other ways. All in all an enjoyable read............once.
1,i could have made this myself,"This wasn't a quality poster. It looks like it was printed off a low grade printer. Cut unevenly. No gloss, no border, lo-definition."
4,a fast-paced expose of modern teeveeland,"I loved this book! MacNeil write with piercing clarity of the world he knows so well. Food for thought, it made me want to race to watch the next newsbroadcast. I'll be searching for Brenda and Gregory Peck at 6 o'clock tonight for sure!"
3,A pleasant read,"I enjoyed reading this book. Perhaps it was because I found myself identifying with the characters, or perhaps it was pondering what Robert MacNeil feels about the state of television news today.Unfortunately, I found that there was very little too the plot. The novel just kept going along, and I didn't find any story dragging me in, though I did continue to read.I found the book did provoke my thoughts in terms of what TV news I watch and why, and was interesting enough that I didn't have to drag myself to finish the book.The ending was unsatisfying for me, but I did enjoy reading the book, and ""connected"" to many of the characters, so while I can't give this book a high rating, I certainly can't deny that I enjoyed reading it."
2,"Definitely not a ""page turner""","MacNeil's new novel is disppointing to say the least. The characters are flat and poorly developed.The plot, thin and uninteresting attempts to grab the readers' attention by meaningless forays into extraeneous, ridiculous scenes. One such example is the attept by a ""georgeous"" stewardess to lure our hero into a nefarious tryst during a flight.That someone of the stature of Mr. Macneil should stoop so low as to publish such trash is ironic confirmation of the those aspects of modern journalism that the book attempts to ridicule."
4,Entertaining yarn about TV news,"Generally entertaining page-turner that also skewers network 'teeveenews."" However, it runs out of steam at the end with a somewhat weak tying up of the strands in the story"
3,Provocative expose of television news industry,"The characters in Macneil's new book are deftly drawn, obviously from his experience as a TV newsman. Macneil's Grant Munro, the aging ""Gregory Peck"" of the network news business provides the reader with plenty to like -- and plenty to wonder about. Although the ending is pat, the issues raised and the surprisingly compelling plot make this a good read. It would have been nice to see some of the characters more fully developed, especially Munro's arch rival Ann Murrow, a face-lifted, flesh-tearing tvnews magazine opportunist with a strong sexual appeal."
2,Not a great book.,This book doesn't include any text about stairs. I guess most complete homes don't need stairs. I find this book more of a coffee table book than a book I can count on for howto information.
4,"Good resource, but it BEFORE you start your project","If you're a pro, this isn't your textbook. But if you're just ""handy"" or starting out on home improvements, read this book cover to cover before you start your project. You can make a LOT of mistakes that are either more costly or impossible to fix after the fact.Formatting for Kindle was good, also good on the Kindle app for Mac OS and for iPad. Pictures were helpful, liked the layout. Not too technical, but not written for ""dummies"" either."
3,Basic is the key word. Still a good book.,"The Black and Decker Complete Guide series are excellent. However, this book is basic for me. Good book for those who are looking for basic knowledge on carpentry. I'd give a 5 star if the book had more advanced projects of framing details of bathrooms and porches."
4,good book,not as in depth as i would have hoped from black and decker but still a good find on carpentry for the home
2,Not Bad... But not good either.,"It is an OK book, but I think O'Dell can do much better then this. Compared to Island of the Blue Dolphins this book has no depth at all. The characters are under developed and the story is very choppy and confusing at times. If you have nothing better to do, this book isn't too bad and it's a quick read. But if you're looking for in depth, exciting reading, this is NOT it."
3,A good book with twists,This book was very injoyable to read because of the vocabulary and the character development. It was well written and had my wanting to read more all the time. Scott O'dell is a great author. This book I would recommend to all readers would like mysteries.
1,WTF?,"I enjoyed the premise and the characters, but so much of the bookwas unexplained and confusing that when I finished it I checked tomake sure I had a complete copy. I mean, WTF? Why does Lucinda's fatherhave 18 crystal coffins full of young dead women in the basement?Where did he find them and how did he get them on the island? Whydid he kill them? And the ending - it seems as if Lucinda will haveto choose beteween her fiance and the doctor, but then they bothget blown up! WTF?"
2,"Good overview of progressive forces in 60's, 70's Detroit.","Bob Mast was clearly involved in the progressive labor and civil rights struggle in the 70's or earlier in Detroit. His interviews with various others involved in the progressive struggle attempt to determine what went right, what went wrong, and where are those people now?"
2,A tough sell,"As a high school teacher, I find this will be a tough sell, even to an advanced English class. What were the producers thinking? The narration is slow and dorky. I recommendEmily Dickinson: A Certain Slant of Lightinstead. Even though the video quality is poor,the narration of Julie Harris is much more palatable. Harris takes the viewer to Emily's home and to other locations of importance in her life. Viewers will see where Dickinson wrote and will see artifacts often pictured in biographies of the author. I purchased both dvds, but I will only show the Harris dvd. Skip this one."
5,Christian Parents and Educators Need to Read This Book,"I am a writer and have read hundreds of books in the last three years dealing with the political and philosophical origins of public education. This book may be the most important one I have read. Read it first yourself. Then give it to Christian school administrators and teachers, whether they work in public or private schools. If you have ever wondered WHY the public schools often seem to undermine the Christian values of parents and children, this book will reveal it all to you.This is a short read (114 pages). Much of it is an analysis of Dewey's educational philosophy, so it may tax those who aren't accustomed to reading about intangible things. But if you are a Christian, and have any involvement with the public schools, you must read this little book to understand HOW so many things have gone wrong with our schools."
5,gritty and visceral,"Lida plays the gringo-mexicano dynamic like a cello. Sexual victimization comes across as a major theme, perhaps serving as a two-way metaphor for US-Mexico relations and for class relations within Mexican society. Although we sometimes sense this dynamic in inter-American news stories, Lida's fiction brings it into high relief. Americans who have traveled in Mexico will squirm as they see themselves in some of these stories, and as they recognize the brutalities of Mexican life that ardent Mexicophiles like to sweep under the bed. Hard to pick a favorite among the 10 stories, but I loved ""The Recruiting Officer"" and ""Taxi""."
1,Twisted and sick..,"These stories aren't about Mexico, and I'm sickened that they're touted among Mexican websites. While the writing is strong and compelling, each story left me with sickened feeling that any reasonable reader might compare the perverted thrust with life in Mexico, even from a traveler's point of view.I've seen fly-infested puestos less toxic that this book."
5,Raw and hard-edged as a double shot of cheap tequila.,"This is Mexico today, not yesteryear. David Lida has an uncanny ability to get into the heads of a variety of flawed, very human characters. If you want Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, you'll find Travel Advisory disturbing and disorienting. OTOH if you watch the Independent Film Channel, like Jim Jarmusch or old film noir, you'll find it gripping, very real and hard to put down. I liked it and found it very centered on the troubled Mexico of the turn of the millenium. But ""heartwarming"" or ""feel-good"" it's not. It ain't hokey or sappy either. The characters are victims, predators, losers and some are just not very nice, but all are very real. Unlike the characters, the style is flawless."
1,Turned my Curly Hair into Straw,"This product did nothing for the color of my very dark, curly hair but did turn it into a dry, frizzy mess. I used it three times and now I am going to toss the bottle into the trash."
1,Doesn't work very well for thick hair...,"I recently bought this with the matching moisturizing conditioner. At first, I was really excited to be using it. However, I found that it takes quite a bit of the conditioner to get a good lather going and to evenly cover my hair.After I dried it with my towel, I noticed that my hair wasn't very moist and it was left feeling very dry. It was even worse when I tried to comb it out. My comb would keep getting caught in my hair and wouldn't run smoothly through it. I think it might have to do with the fact that I have thick, long hair. I definitely don't think that I'll be buying these products again. I'd prefer to use a shampoo and conditioner that's made just for colored hair of any kind. I feel that, for a product that is supposed to be moisturizing, it doesn't do the job. If you have thick hair like me, you might want to pass this up."
3,Do not believe to what is writen in Haynes Repair!,"Cheap but bad book. May be it is good to have it, I would buy it anyway even now, as there is no cheap alternative for it. There is much false information in it, do not beleive it at all. I thought better of it. It is not as helpful as it could be."
4,Its a car repair book- the plots rather predictable,"Typical Haynes repair manual- take vehicle, tells you how to disassemble it, repair it, reassemble it. It would be helpfull if they gave a better list of speciality tools the vehicle needs when working on it.I do wish Haynes would man up and make a book how to overhaul automatic transmissions and standards- along with a parts supply house."
1,Hire a mechanic,"I have a 99 Limited 4.7, and so far this book hasn't been worth the paper it is printed on. It was wrong on removing a door panel, and fortunatly I figured it out before I ruined the panel. My current project is replacing the radiator and water pump. The book did not mention that the front skid plate needs to be removed (minor) as well as the entire front facia (not so minor). The drain plugs need to be removed from the block, I just haven't been able to get to them with conventional sockets/box, or open ended wrenches. hopefully the crow's foot I just bought will do the trick. It stated that the special spanner you need to remove the fan clutch is readily available at most parts stores, just not the major store chains we have here in California(Kragen, Auto Zone). I've replaced a few radiators, and this one has turned into a nightmare. If the book had been straight up, I would have had a pro handle this. Jeeps suck."
2,Somewhat useful but disappointing overall,"These manuals have become fairly common. I bought it to help with some upcoming work on my Jeep. I have quite a bit of experience working on cars but none on this vehicle. I found that the manual has a lot of pictures and description of steps of work to perform but details of sticky situations, tools required and specs on clearances, tightening torques, adjustments, etc. are non-existent. These details are what makes a shop manual worth buying. Without this additional data, you cannot complete a job cirrectly in many cases. Haynes just doesn't offer that information."
3,"Better than average, but . . .","This book, and I might presume the series, are OK for a little extra info for the home user who hasn't attempted certain repairs before, so need a general guide. But I've too often found that the detail I'd like isn't in here. For example, to replace certain things like the heater control door, it tells me that removing the dash should be done by a repair shop. Come on, give me a few tips, and we'd get thru it. It's nice to have the photos, but the book covers too long a period, so that a photo showing a picture for one era doesn't show what it really is for an earlier or later year."
3,Useful,This was quite a useful handbook but I would have preferred one which was more model specific.I found navigation in the book to be tricky. One consolation though the exact same handbook was selling in Australia for twice the price from Amazon which included the freight. Four times the price NOT including the freight! Go figure! Always check Amazon FIRST
1,Waste of Money,"I agree with the first poster. I wish I had read that review before I bought this book. I can't believe the amount of typos and grammatical errors in this book, nevermind the fact that it is supposed to be a study guide for a READING test. Apalling. It has really poor organization and the answers for the sample test actually insult you if you get them wrong. Don't waste your money on this joke of a study guide."
3,MTel Foundations of Reading Study Guide review,I was pleased with the different sections of the study guide as well as the practice tests. I was pleased with the explanations of the test. These different parts of the study guide was helpful. The part of the study guide that was very disappointing was the fact that there were so many errors in the questions and throughout the test. It almost made me think how valid are the responses to the test questions.I would consider looking at other options as well as this study guide to be sure I cover all the bases.
3,Okay but there is better,"I had already read a couple of books where people had gone through really bad circumstances and turned their bad times into really good ones such as AUSSIE JOHN where he had built a business up only to lose it and ended up living in a motel - and I don't mean the HYATT - rebuilt it and bounced back far better than before.This book certainly wasn't about people who had wrested victory from defeat, true they had some bad luck but were no where near the bottom of the barrel I don't think any of them even dropped to middle class - better reading would be AUSSIE JOHN or PUSHING THE LIMITS"
5,Great introduction to home theater systems,"This book gives a good overview of what it takes to put together a small to medium sized home theater system (big screen TV, A/V receiver, speakers, DVD, HIFI VCR, etc..). The book was published this year so it is pretty up to date on all the latest technologies (HDTV, progressive scan DVD,..) which is important in this rapidly changing field. I think the book goes into just the right level of detail in explaining the different technologies available. If you haven't started looking at getting a system yet you will be astounded by the many brands, systems, options, and devices you have to choose from. This book will help you make the choices intelligently. If you don't read this book and think the salesperson at your local electornics store is going to sell you the system that is right for you then you will probably be disappointed with your purchase. Get this book and be an informed consumer."
3,An unholy mess of a film,"Judge Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict -- ""With multiple directors it's somewhat difficult to determine who is responsible for what, but the overall atmosphere of Blood Bath is impressively creepy. Part of that is due to the actors giving some intense performances, but the lion's share of the credit goes to the nighttime black-and-white photography. It's not quite as stylized as typical noir or horror, but the darker scenes have an interesting edge to them, and even the scenes in daylight have an ""off"" quality. The idea of somehow capturing life or death on canvas is a good one. Sure Oscar Wilde did it with Dorian Gray, and it's been done in other pics as well, but the whole ""Dead Red Nudes"" concept is a solidly weird one. But the fact that the film throws in a bizarre vampire subplot to this already over-saturated tale just shows how off the rails an hour-long film can get."""
5,Everybody Luvs Harry,This is a spectacular collection of Latin songs by a vibes player who has got a spectacular Latin feel for a guy from Roslyn.
1,this product sucks and so does the company,i bought this product and have had nothing but trouble. i couldn't get a response from their website either. i got the phone number from the company where i bought the product and waited for 45 minutes to get a rude customer service rep. i sent back the product (6months old) with a check for $89 and all of the wires and remote. got back just the machine without any way of using it. don't buy this product unless you want frustration and to spend more money!!!!!!
3,So far so good,"Just got this a couple of weeks ago. So far I haven't had any trouble getting it to record TV shows. The manual could be written a little more in depth. I haven't been able to figure out how to make copies of my old VHS tapes, so I guess I will have to get my 12 year old to help me with that. It took a couple of days to figure out how to get it to record TV programs with the timer, but eventually I figured it out.I think I got a good deal when I figured out how much it would cost me to take all my home movies somewhere and have them made to DVD...that is...if I can figure out how to do it!!When I emailed their customer service dept. I had a reply within 48 hours."
3,Not bad for the price,I received this recorder as a birthday gift last March. It was working great until September when the eject froze and the machine was being very sluggish if it was working at all. I took it to a repair shop in December and the guy said it was a quality machine with a few crappy parts. So he replaced the parts and I haven't had a problem since. For the cheep price I think it was worth the little bit of hassle that it caused. It's a good first recorder to practice on and to see if you really will use it as much as you think you will.
2,Seems everyone has the same problem.,"This thing works great for six months, just like everyone else says, then just starts having all sorts of problems. It says ""no disc"", then ""reading"", then it says ""open"", but its closed, then its stuck reading ""ch 003 ME"". I just emailed cyberhome, and am still waiting for a response, so we'll see how this all pans out. But by the looks of everyone else, probably not so well. Can anyone say lawsuit....cause I smell one cooking. I'm not throwing out money without a fight. Anyway, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!"
1,What a Piece of Junk,"I bought the cyberhome Dvd recorder the day after thanksgiving. now it is dead. it lasted only 8 months. the trouble started a month ago. when i turn it on the display would read CH 042 ME. and while the diaplay read ME none of the buttons would work, on the remote or the machine itself. and i could hear a slight knocking noise comming from the drive. then after a time it would finaly come on and be usable. i tried e-mailing cyberhome. but got no responce from them. if you want a dvd recorder, DO NOT Buy from Cyberhome. Spend the extra money, Buy SONY. or you could be like me, the owner of a dead dvd recorder, without the money to buy another recorder."
1,Junk! that looks good.,"I purchased my Cyberhome DVR-1500 form HSN. I used it one time and then the eject tray froze up. I e-mailed Cyberhome for support (yeah right), but what they advised didn't work, This was back in May. After 4 more e-mails asking for service I haven't heard from them since. Their phones (or should say phone because they must only have one) is always busy. The unit also is always very hot. Please don't buy this your wasting your money. After seeing all the bad news about this product I am going to write a complaint to the better business bureau and I advise everyone else to do the same. And Stores should stop offering anything from Cyberhome. If I could give no stars I would. I may have to take the loss and burn the unit in a bonfire ceremony."
1,Worked for four months...,"This recorder worked pretty good until the warranty ran out. Unfortunately, the full warranty is only for three months. The unit ran extremely hot and had numerous lock-ups before the end. The heat led to a blown capacitor on the board. This seems to be a common occurrance with other users of this product. Anyway, great dvd recorder, but horrible design. If you decide to buy one (I highly advise against it), open the cover to allow a little bit of cooling. It might last a few weeks longer. One other thing, Cyberhome does not seem to stand behind their products. Forget about tech support..."
1,Cyberhome Replacement,"Cyberhome finally responded to my requests that my 1500 model is locking up. They offered to send me a new 1530 model. Has anyone done this and actual received the new unit from this company? If so how does the new 1530 model work? I don't trust Cyberhome, I can see me paying shipping and getting nothing back!"
4,Design Flaw discovered,"My DVR1500 had all the troubles and symptoms described here. However an electronics engineer at my workplace examined it for me and discovered a design flaw. Two of the main capacitors on the motherboard are smaller in capacity than they should be and this allows the voltage to surge all over the place ultimately leading to the demise of the machine. He replaced them for me with larger capacity ones and the machine cooled down and now works like a charm. Don't know if Cyberhome has discovered this or will admit it, but it seems to be working for me. The 4-star rating is for post repaired machine."
1,JUNK,Please do not waist your $$$$This is junk. And most cyberhome products are made not to last.And by the way their customer service stinks.It's less then 2 years old and going to the dumpster
1,Didn't work straight out of the box,"I guess I'll join the legions of other reviewers who will attest that this product is junk. I wish I had read these reviews before buying mine. After turning the unit on for the 1st time and sticking in the blank DVD that came with the unit, it just says ""format"" on the player screen for a few seconds then won't do anything, not even eject the disc. I have to turn the player off & back on just to get the blank disc out. Tried multiple brands of DVD+Rs and all had the same problem. Contacted Cyberhome customer service via email & they replied that discs need to be formatted, but there is no info about how to do that in the manual. Posted for help on a Cyberhome user message board & others told me you do not need to format DVD+Rs as they are preformatted and there is no way to even do that on the player. So, bad unit, plus bad info from their tech support. Basically I now have a $200 DVD player, not a recorder."
2,the jury is still out,I want to change my last review until We reach a verdit. They are going to send me my 4th recorder.I am hopeing that they have one that works.If they dont I will get back to you.
1,never again cyber home,"junk,junk,junk,junk,junk,junk,junk,junk.no service no answer to e mail or phone call."
1,"Yup, just like everyone warned me!","DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I figured, hey how much of a piece of junk can this be. I am an IT director I can figure it out and make it work. So I went out to best buy and picked it up. Everything seemed simple enough to understand and setting it up was easy. The firmware didnt need upgrading it already had 128A. I put in one of the supplied CD+RW and tested it out. Recorded a couple minutes and watched the results, not bad. Next step to tape a program on a CD+R memorex(on their TESTED list). Recorded the show and went to standby, recording done. Pressed the standby and never got past the CYBERHOME Screen. Locked up solid. Best Buy had to take it apart to get my DVD out. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! Going to try the Philips dvdr75 next."
1,Cyberhome has gone bankrupt,"Please note that it is no longer possible to get ANY customer support, warranty coverage nor even downloadable manuals or upgrades. Purchasing a Cyberhome model of any kind is a poor proposition, owing to their high rate of failure, and, oh, that detail about their being out of business. [...]"
1,Problems Problems......,"Bought this unit March04. Worked OK for a few days then.... First, the unit froze up when recording. After turning off Reset/Power switch in rear, everything was fine, except for the fact that the recording had to be started over again. This would happen every 8-10 discs. This unit has a mind of it's own and I can't list every problem. I have read all reviews and found nobody gives it 5 stars. Hopefully, someone from Cyberhome reads these and reacts. I'm kind of tired of paying good money for things that only last a short time."
1,Avoid Cyberhome.,"Pro.1. The product has good features.Con.1. The product will not work long.2. The company has poor customer service.3. When, there is a problem,they will expect you to ship it to them at your own expensefor either a repairor for a replacement that does not have the same featuresas the one you originally bought.I recommend avoiding Cyberhome products altogether.It's worth it to pay more for a reputable & dependable company'sproduct."
1,Not Happy,I recieved the Cyberhome DVR-1500 last Christmas- by March it was acting up- not recording previously scheduled programs-error messages-stop rec- I contacted Cyberhome and they had me ship it to them at my cost $13 and they sent me a new one which was slightly different. Now 4&1/2 months later (out of the warrenty period) this one is doing the very same thing!
1,PURE JUNK,"If you have the money to waste, CyberHome products is your one stop shop. The CH-DVR1500 recorder is easily outclassed by any cheap AM portable radio. Any blank disc inserted into the machine will automatically go to the format mode (even if it pre-formatted) and hang up until the power is turned off. Tried five different brands of blank DVD's with the same result. Never got the chance to record anything. The playback mode with pre-recorded discs gives a mostly fuzzy picture. The built-in channel tuner didn't recognize 12 cable channels so the unit just bypassed them during setup. I have never in my life been so disappointed with a purchase. Even more disappointed with customer service. It is mostly non-existent and if you manage to get a human voice you are more than likely talking to someone less useful than used egg shells. The only comfort I got out of this machine was when I took my 20lb sledge hammer to it."
1,Mono recording in XXI century?,I was so disappointed when I found out that cyberhome can record only audio only in mono (not stereo). I returned it to the store.
1,"Works great, for 3 months","This worked well to start, once the labor warranty goes, so does the machine, and FORGET service from the company, stayed on hold for over an hour and never got to speak to anyone, won't respond to e-mails either. Will now look for a different brand that hopefully will last more than 3 dvd recordings from my camcorder"
1,Wish it worked,"I love the features and ease of use of this DVD recorder. Too bad it doesn't work. Then the disk tray started freezing up along with the on/off switch. I sent it to Cyberhome for repairs and got it back. It worked once and then froze up again. I have a Panasonic and tried a Sony DVD recorder. They are more complicated to use and do not have some of the desirable features of this model. Thus far the Panasonic works reliably but is more difficult to use, e. g. in editing. Wish Cyberhome could work out the bugs in their product because it's so much easier to operate (when it works)."
1,In the trash,"This player lasted 6 months and locked up. I tried firmware upgrades, removing the drive and manually opening the disc tray, and the suggestions offered on the Cyberhome website. Nothing worked. Don't waste your money on this cheap player."
1,bad product,The recorder that I bought was broke down right after 3.5 months (just passed 90 days warranty period). It some how could not detect the disk anymore. This is the worst product I ever bought...you will be regretted if you buy the recorder.. The worst part was the techincal support did not respone ..the waiting time to reach a techincal support by phone was more than 45 mins..
1,Beware!!,"I have had FIVE units since November 2003! I have had the 2500, 1500 and the 1530, all were junk! The 1530 (which I have had two of) did not work from the first day I received them! Cyberhome customer service is about to send me my sixth unit."
2,Not happy with product,"I too bought this system a week ago thinking I was getting a dvd recorder that would record in dvd quality - I was wrong. First of all when I opened the box and began setting the unit up I noticed a rattle inside the unit itself. Yes thats correct there were loose pieces inside the unit. I thought - well I will plug it in and see if it works anyway. It worked - but the quality of the recordings at the Highest level on my PC dvd was not what I expected. Every recorded dvd that I tried ""SP and HQ mind you"" lacked color depth. It seemed as if was watching the dvd through a fog. Anyway unit is going back!!! And I will probably pay more for something with quality."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK. I HATE IT!,"It's a good thing that it has a thirty day warranty. Good for me because I saw how big of a waste of money this was within the first week that I had it. You get what you pay for, this I know, but still - if you're gonna shell out $245 for something, it should atleast give you a little bit of quality. First, it records everything in a dark, kinda black and white tint. You don't get full fledged color at all. Second, it cuts off automatically while taping things and the quality isn't that great.I HATE IT. I'M TAKING MINE BACK TODAY.It also gets overheated, and the discs are so hot when they come out, that its not funny."
2,REGUARDLESS OF PRICE,"I BROUGHT THIS RECORDER IN DECEMBER OF 03 I WANST OFFERED THE 26.00 ""KEEP AS NEW"" Warranty and on april 02 the recoreder just stopped working i dont want to send it out because i may not ever get it back so when it did work it record fairly well no it wouldnt get pass protected movies ok i can live with that but i'm seriously disappointed with this machine and i havent heard from cyberhome yet"
1,Totally Dissatisfied,After only a week of recording it would not recognize or finalize discs that are compatible with the recorder. After recording it shows nothing was recorded and then comes up with an error message. The machine gets burning hot which I think might be the main problem. Evidently alot of other people have experienced the same problem. I certainly would not recommend throwing away your receipt as you will be taking it back within 2 months guaranteed!
2,"good recordings, but a lazy DVD player/recorder","Sure it's a DVD recorder, and yes it can transfer your old time VHS classics. But it's lazy. what I mean by that is that the player works when it wants to, he accepts only certain types of blanks, you can only use DVD+R all other's will not function, if you want to watch a movie it takes an eternity for it to load. Plus it has the worst fast forwarding feature I have ever seen: instead of fast forwarding the picture it lags even more. The player brings 3 DVD+RW blanks that records but can't be used in another player. The finalizing process to make your DVD recordings compatible with other players takes an eternity as well. Sometimes while finalizing it erases everything; basically everything you recorded is gone. Sure it works, it records, and it has good picture quality. But it sucks and it's slow and lazy. Simply put.MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5"
3,"So far, so good","I received my recorder for a Christmas gift. So far I haven't had a problem with it, although I do agree with the other reviews that state the dvd's are hot when removed after playing. I, also, am not crazy about the 24 hour clock!! So far I have only recorded from the tv ~ live and on timer ~ and have no complaints. I just have to figure out the wiring of dvd player-to-dvd recorder (for copying) and vcr-to-dvd recorder. Nothing to do with the product, I just need to get in gear!!"
1,Think Twice!!,"I have had nothing but problems with the CyberHome product I purchased. The machine will not record on timed recordings, sometimes there is color, other times, no. The customer service @ Cyber Home is a joke, no responses. The sound quality leaves much to be desired, and recording quality is not good. You may only use certain types of discs with this machine, I have found only one type to work."
1,Terrible,"Do not buy a Cyberhome product. I have the 1600 model and started having problems viewing DVD's and using the DVD recorder 2 months after purchasing the product. The customer service was terrible. I e mailed them several times without receiving an answer. The labor warrenty was only 3 months. I contacted them via phone, was on hold for an hour, and finally talked to a rude man who told me that I should have updated my firmware via downloading it from the wedsite. The download wouldn't work and he stated he would send me a disc. It never arrived. Awful company!!!"
3,Does almost everything so far,"I just got this today Seems to do a good enough job recording clear video.I had bought the RCA DRC8000 from sams for almost 100 dollars more. This one is almost as good, but it has IR blaster for changing channels on the cable box.It's good enough, and at a good price.Still I liked the RCA better."
2,what you paid is what you get!,"i works quite well as more expensive one from Phillips, panasonic...however, the device is made in China. the DVD attacment place in front of the dvd tray falled off from the tray. how can it be? does the heat generate after recording 2 movie from my tivo cause the glue to break off? it good be nice if the information display the time remain on record disk. if i record movie or program from satellite (dishnetwork). complete full dvd+rw sometime can read back on bundle dvd+rw media. i also have problem with imation dvd+rw when it write over 4.4GB of data. the last VOB file is unreable."
3,having readability troubles,"I just bought my recorder a few weeks ago. Although it works great I cannot get my discs to read onto my dvd player in our minivan. It is a brand new van, but i guess it is not compatable with the player. I also have a dvd player which is a few years old which doesn't read my disc. Is anyone experiencing these problems? I thought i would be able to tape my kids favorite shows and have them watch in the car. Should i return this for something a little pricer. Any suggestions?"
1,A $300 paper weight!,"If you in the market for a $300 paper weight that looks like a DVD recorder this is the product for you! If not, stay away from this product!! After having numerous problems including, frequent crashes, recording problems, media issues, and finally a terminal lock up that could not be remedied, I decided to have a look at the inside of this thing. Much to my disbelief this thing even looks bad on the inside with some very sloppy assembly (I bought it new with a factory seal). I am astounded that this low-quality product ever made the mainstream market. It is a piece of junk fresh out of the box and I recommend avoiding it at any cost!!!"
4,No aggravation with second unit!,"Update of early March review. Returned one unit since it started giving error messages every time you breathed on it. This replacement works perfectly. Even the remote buttons have a different response. Have had no problems at all, transferring my vhs-c and vhs family tapes to dvds, old vh-1 special programs, recording from cable and network tv. I used it for about 4 hours a day so far, some days 11 hours, trying to transfer the family videos before machine started to act like the one I returned. I usually use the hq setting as I want the best possible results for archiving videos. I did not do any firmware updates or anything else. I made sure to buy at another branch of store so I didnt get one from same batch as the first one. Hopefully this will last for a while. Have been using this one for 4 weeks, with Maxell,Memorex,CompUSA and Kypermedia blanks. All work fine."
5,"cutting board, flexible","excellent product. folds in 1/2, and not slippery when cutting. Also, looks pretty sitting folded in 1/2 on my counter."
3,"Well, I Liked It","It's not a quick, slick or even well-made horror movie. But it's well-cast, well-scored and well worth a small price if it should ever come out on dvd. This is a vampire movie devoid of all the pretentiousness and hit-me-over-the-head-with-your-vampire-sex-appeal monsters and is instead a Gothic story about a female stranger in a strange land who discovers that her Romanian roots includes vampires. And while someone in the makeup department had a little too much fun with the white foundation, the way the vamps get their fix (not through elongated fangs) makes them memorable. Other than the fact that the film has incredible atmosphere, I'm uncertain as to why ""Daughter of Darkness"" has such an alluring, low budget charm, but it does. Mia Sara does a good job playing the troubled American school teacher in search of her Romanian father, well-played by Anthony Perkins. Once you hear the opening music, you'll be hard-pressed to get it out of your head."
1,Movie tape was blank,"Tape received in good condition - went to play it and only had a BLUE SCREEN.Put in another tape and it played fine...... so, tape is blank?????Oh well."
2,Nothing to grave about...,"This is one of those made-4-TV movies that often show a lack of character...'Daughter of Darkness' is no exception. Anthony 'Norman Bates' Perkins makes the best of his role as the father/head vampire. The film starts well, but it becomes lethargic and a little silly. These vampires have no fangs, instead these weird spiky things emerge from their tongues (ala the armpit mutant thing from 'Rabid'.Not a particularly memeorable film, which is a shame considering it comes from 'Re-Animator' director Stuart Gordon."
5,Family Trust improved my trust and helped my family greatly,"You must state in your Trust what you want to have happen.(FAMILY TRUST). My original Trust gave broad powers to my trustee. But, I found out from Family Trust by Franke Croke and then from my attorneys that state law requires that 50% of my Trust must be invested in Bonds. I did not want bonds because I know they will reduce the value of my Trust. I also discovered that if my wife became ill and wanted our daughter to visit her, travel expenses would not be paid from the Trust unless I authorized it. Needless to say, I revised my Trust, thanks to this book. My trustee is instructed to put my assets in growth stocks, mutual funds and index funds and is instructed to pay the travel expenses of my children and grandchildren to visit my wife. I've now got a Trust document that will be a real help to my family thanks to Frank Croke and his book Family Trust. Sincerley, Robert Schilling"
2,Why Lawyers Never Write Imperfect Trust Documents,"There is some useful information in this book, but the main purpose of the work appears to be an attempt to justify all the sins of omission and commission perpetrated by lawyers in the area of family trusts. The most popular and useful of the trusts is the revocable living trust, to which Croke devotes 5 pages out of 300. Lots of ""see your lawyer on this"" though. Better to read the book by the Schumachers."
5,It's easy to understand Norton,"I've used this book over the years with enthusiasm. Even though it is somewhat out of date, Norton's books, as always, make it easy to understand what he has to say."
4,Good book,"The author clearly explains the topic. My only complaint is that some of the problems are rather difficult, and there isn't a solution key."
5,Zune Silicone Cover,This product is great. It fits on my Zune like a second skin. Love the color too.
4,Good for the price...,"I have the same lens but for pentax and the images are taken with my Pentax K10D. Yes, as you will read about this lens it is 'soft.' Meaning that the image isn't entirely sharp. This can be rectified by uping your f stop to help increase sharpness and then in photo editing adding extra sharpness. The lens is very light and easy to use as it is made of plastic, but that's not bad. It focuses easily and zooms easily. For the price you can't go wrong. The lens gives very pleasing images and with slight photo editing they are very good images (though not excellent). Not a bad lens but realize what you are paying for."
4,very good overview,"Johnny Cash was one of the most Honest voices to Ever hit the airwaves no matter what the style of music.He sung songs like He was putting his own Blood on the Line.like the song ""I walk the line"" He truly didn't bow down to nobody. He always had his own way&style about doing things.He was a really good story-teller. Johnny Cash in some ways was a pre-cursor to Hip-Hop because He could create a Atmosphere&tell the story in a edgy kind of way. His vocal Instrument could grab you&make you feel all the details that were going down."
4,"Unique, Enlightening, and Enjoyable","I purchased this album on a whim at my local college record store. I listened to the very first song and immediately knew I needed to get it. The vocals are entrancing and sound a little bit like Sarah Mclachlan with the music a mix between Hooverphonic and Tricky. However, I wouldn't even really consider it to be trip hop. There are so many layers to this album that it is really quite amazing. It is techno, trip hop, classical, and mainstream all blended into one sonic excursion of sound. Song one is one of if not the best on the album. It is simply superb. Song four is a little jazzy which is really fun to listen to (especially the vocals). Song five is an incredible love song, very moving. Other standouts include songs six, seven, and nine. But to be honest, there is not one bad track on here. I highly recommend this album if you would like to hear something refreshingly original, creative, and conducive to your listening pleasure. Nearly 5 stars."
5,music to study by,Great easy listening music with a touch of jazz - great for studying or just contemplating life.
3,Visual Basic 5 SuperBible with CDROM,"Its little bit Advance lavel book, but it contain huge refernce. They try to re-presnt like VB dictionary. Its not bad."
2,Online help is just as good,"I bought this book hoping to get good coding techniques for VB5, especially for some of the newer controls in VB. All I got was a rehash of VB's online help.Get it if you can spare the cash and hate reading the online documentation."
2,Well written regurgitation of the OnLine Help.,"Two volumes, 105 chapters consisting of 2275 pages should have provided more real information.Volume 1 is only useful as a reference. No real instructional value here. Most of it was done better in VB's online help. In Volume 2 are a couple of pretty good but short chapters on ActiveX, OLE and OOP. There are also three chapters on databases which barely scratch the surface.You could throw away the first volume and just use the second volume which is almost useful except that the table of contents for both volumes is in volume 1.I don't recomend it. However, if you hate using online help then this is the book for you."
2,"SuperBible is OK, but Not Super",I have a lot of VB books. This one is fair - but it misses out on some useful items like MSChart and the database section is weak on items like Schema.ini. Some good examples make it worthwhile.
4,Fun Time,"After stealing the game from my boyfriend whenever he would let me have it for a couple hours, he got it for me for Christmas. When he first got it for himself, I thought it was boring and I was going to hate it. But now I can't stop playing. It's nice because the songs aren't long so you don't have to commit too much time to playing each time you turn it on. I find it really challenging, as I have no rhythm. I've been telling people it's like DDR, except you're tapping on a screen rather than tapping your feet on the floor. To me, it's definitely worth picking up. The only negative...too much stuff that can be skipped. Luckily, they have a skip option!"
3,Buy the game new. Not from a reseller.,"I just bought a DSLite. Since Elite Beat Agents is over a year old I dropped by my local GameStop to pick up the game used. I thought I got a bargain. I fired up the game in my brand new DS to see that the game saved all the former player's game stats. The second hand EBA game shows all the sites cleared meaning everything is open. I have no idea where to start. The map is on a free spinning ball so there is no linear way for me to figure out where to go next. This will probably ruin the story line for me, time will tell. The game tap happy game so far is fun. I started playing in easy mode but the sites I picked was already bumping up the difficulty. It a huge turn off when a game you started playing just kicks your butt. I recommend buying the game new. Unless someone knows how to reset a DS cartridge. If you know how to reset this game, I would appreciate the information."
3,Elite Beat Agents=Secret Gold,"Person i bought it from gave me a crappy box, no instruction booklet..was a used box from GAmestop. Game is fun tho, great music and everyone who listens to the song wants to try and join along. Game is kinda hard, but fun."
4,I enjoyed the game a lot!,"I just got this game about 3 weeks ago. I had a lot of fun with it! The music collections are good, and most of them are really popular. There is one mission for each song, and based on the players' performance, the stories have different endings. The other fun thing is that besides competing with each other, when two players both have the game, they can co-operate to complete the missions under DS-DS connection mode. My friend and I had a wonderful time."
3,"Fun at first, but...","When i first bought it, i was really happy.The game was good at first, but after playing it for a long time,it gets pretty boring.i havent pkllayed the game in like 1 1/2 yrs.The game Osu!Tatakae!Ouendan! is the same as this game,but the Ouendan one is better.EBA has only 19 songs,like material girls, YMCA, Sk8ter Boi, and other songs.Ouendan has slightly more songs and the songs are J-POP, so....yeah."
2,Meh,"Don't get me wrong, it's fun enough at first, but then you realize if you don't beat the song the first time, you have to watch all the stupid cutscenes over and over and over and over again. Then you realize there are hardly any songs and the game takes only about an hour to finish. The only way to play more and get your money's worth is to play the songs all over again on harder levels. Once you get to around level 8, you realize even when you hit every dot you're only just above red. That's when you notice your screen is scratched up from playing this gift from Satan, and you have a final exam tomorrow that you've barely studied for because you can't get the song Skater Boy out of your head and every time you close your eyes you see circles.In other words, if you are the type of person who has to finish what you've started, get out while you still can."
1,disapointing game,"the game is disappointing to me. its hard to keep up with the beat in any song in the beginning but since there's only 19 songs... it gets pretty easy. its super boring, and me and my family stopped playing it for years. i don't recommend this game to anyone."
4,Elite Beat Agent DS Lite,It was a gift for someone. She loved it a lot and that makes it a good review for me.
3,Overrated game.,"I thought the game was too repetative and kind of boring after a while. Also, Amazon lowered the price 5 bucks right after they shipped it. What is that about?!"
2,Stick with the original,I bought this game the other day and all I can say is this version is pure garbage. The songs don't seem to match the agents when they dance to the beat. Do yourself a favor and buy the original: Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan. This game was lost in translation.
2,"Potential, lost due to poor soundtrack","I had played Ouendan, the japanese game this game was modeled after, and while they play basically the same, the original was much better. This is primarily due to the fact that the soundtrack for Elite Beat Agents was terrible. The songs in Ouendan were popular Jpop, and had fairly catchy tunes. Elite Beat Agents uses either unheard of or ancient songs such as YMCA. Basically, it seems like they just looked for the cheapest music licenses they could find. It could have been an awesome ""sequel"" for those of us who played ouendan, but instead it ended up being a major disappointment."
1,This book needs a new editor!,"The spelling and editing in this book is horrible. No book should be allowed to be printed without having a professional proofreader review the pages. While the story was interesting in parts, it did slow down and got rather boring by the second half of the book. This became more of an homage to the author than what was happening around him in the world and its effect on his and his family's life.Supposedly this is a novel, but in reality it is an autobiography masked as fiction (and not written very well)."
4,Out for a Challenge?,"If you like shoot 'em ups, or are just plain interested in Firearms, Top Shot is worth a close look. Works like a dream on the G4, and it's not a problem on a 604 either!Give it a go - you'll like it."
5,Want to see the original line up?? with rich killer bass??,"then check this out, unlike the person below me. I don't care about ""extras, special features and s**t like that. I want to see and hear the band live on dvd, and this dvd really delivers the rich sound korn gives out(especially on the bassist side) if you want to see interviews and all the other behind the scenes stuff go on youtube.com. So go grab it, its worth the money. And to me(I like this better than the live on the otherside dvd) :)"
3,"great concert, lacking extras","I didnt really realise when buying this that it wasnt per say a actual 'korn made' dvd, but a release buy the fesitival/dvd company etc. But regardless of that it is a very well produced concert!Super clean video and high quality 5.1 sound.The concert itself would be a 4 / 4.5 for setlist/sound and video quality etcThe only reason i felt it warrents 3stars is because of the complete lack of any special features, some backstagestage or interveiws or something like that would have added to the dvd.As far as the concert goes, i think that if you have seen korn before, or own any other of the Korn dvds then this is in no way essential korn.But for the keen fan it is a well producted concert with a good (yet fairly predicatable) setlist."
5,No more colds or allergies,"I discovered wild oregano 11 years ago after a bout with bronchitis...and 17 years of good ol' seasonal allergies. Since beginning to take this supplement, I have had nary a cold nor any seasonal allergies...and I have lived in three different states/regions in that time. You read that right--no colds or allergies in 11 years! I highly recommend this to friends and have had several tell me that it has helped them in similar ways. Feel free to message me privately and I'll be glad to email you a short article I found that describes a number of health benefits promoted by wild oregano (I promise, I don't have any connection to this or any product, and won't try to sell you anything)."
3,Iffy,"Sometimes OregaMax seems to help and sometimes there is no apparent benefit. Since products of this nature affect different people differently, I can't be sure how efficacious it really is. Therefore I rate it as 3 stars."
5,Oregamax,we've tried many brands of oil of oregano tablets and oils. this is our second fav. it is a good choice as it is readily available. Biotics ADP is our family favorite. you can feel it working.
3,Didnt help me,This may be a good product but it did not help me as it seems to have helped so many others. I did want to mention that one thing that has helped is a Sinus flush- different from the normal irrigation. Go to medhelp.org and type in sinus flush by Friggy. It is the most informative site I have found! I am going to try the Sinus nebulizer discussed there too. Sinus issues are a pain. Good Luck.
4,impressive,"This book is great if you are looking for a single source of information on a wide variety of art techniques. It covers the basics and history of drawing, perspective, watercolors, pastels, oils, acrylics and mixed media and is lavishly illustrated with examples, instructions and types of materials used to create each. While it is not particularily useful if you are looking for an indepth guide to any of these areas, it is an excellent (if pricey) choice if what you want is a good, solid, comprehensive overview."
4,a feast for the eyes,"like all dk books, the illustrations are beautiful. the layout very attractive without being too busy. straight forward information some of which i was not aware of altho i am an artist! i never read ""clean brushes in cold water"" anywhere. i guess it's something the brush companies keep to themselvea to boost sales - it was NEVER printed on the back of any packages of brushes - many of which were very expensive. that info alone paid the book.only minus is that is very heavy and one must stay stationary as opposed to being able to easily cart it around."
2,For Novices to the Topic Only,"This book may be of some use to novices to the topic who want a cursory look at the lives and careers of Ormandy, Muti and Sawallisch, but it's not going to be of much use to anyone who already has even a moderate degree of familiarity with the subject matter.At times, it reads like a high school book report; with just one fact after another, almost in list fasion. And none of the facts are going to be surprising to people who have already done some reading (whether it be other books or on the Internet) on these three conductors.Barry"
3,Not as hokey as I thought it would be.,"I bought this for my husband and he really enjoys it. The graphics are good but you will need a fast pc to make it look good. There is a wide variety of choices/options that can constantly change the game. But I was a little disapointed that I couldn't play one event right after another. Great family game- no violence, gore or sexual content."
5,Mel Torme-Best of the Concord Years,"This was the first Mel Torme purchase I've ever made but I've enjoyed it so much I'm sure I'll get more.Mr. Torme was every bit the seasoned professional everyone has always said he is. Smooth,sweet velvety fog wafting in moonlight.Love It!!"
3,OK for a holiday......,"I am a huge fan of lonely planet guidebooks however I am not a big fan of phrasebooks in general. I have this phrasebook and can honestly say that i have never used it. The problem with phrasebooks is that no 2 are alike. Different phrasebooks give slightly different pronunciations (and with Thai slightly different tones) but again this all has to do with translation from one language into another which is not the best way to learn a new language( acquisition is proven to be the most effective but takes time!). However with this said, phrasebooks are practical for people who do not have time to study a particular language such as Thai which is very difficult for westerners and lonely planet is just as good as any other phrasebook that I have seen on the market to meet the needs of holiday travelers."
4,easy to use,I bought this book because it's small and you can carry it with you on your trips. it's easy to use and understand as well. great book if you're just vacationing and want to learn enough to get around the country.
5,A clear message for a church threatening division,Robert Benson may be the finest Christian writer in America. He has a passionate vision for declaring the reality of God's redemptive love in carefully crafted poetic stories that perfectly capture the truth and power of the Gospel. This is a book that should be read by all Christians faced with disagreement and disunity in their community.
4,Great way to keep Windows in tune.,"SysMech5 may have been superseded, but this is the most cost effective way to keep Windows registry in tune. This 1 year old version does a great job on the 5 year old WinXP operating system. No need to spend more.I particularly like their ability to control those pesky Windows start-up applications. Windows performs like new again - no need to erase all and reload from scratch.The low price of this older version enabled me to purchased System Mechanic for all computers in my office."
4,Great dehydrator,"I am happy with this food dehydrator. I received it in a timely manner, and start using it the end of this summer. It has done a great job. I love the timer and heat settings. So far so good."
3,Ok,"It was okay. A little dated. Reece was great in it though, she probably couldn't do a remake, this is totaly opposite her typical parts she does currently. The effects reminded me of the show Mr. Ed. They put some wires in Kiefers mouth to give it a deranged look. Similar to the wire in Mr. Ed's mouth to make him talk, kind of hoaky."
2,"Boring ""Low Rent"" B movie...","Don't believe the hype, this is not anywhere near as engrossing as similar dark comedies (Natural Born Killers, etc). It is a flat out BORING weak ""B Movie"", it is neither entertaining nor stylisticly creative. The only thing that saves it from getting Zero stars, is some generally good acting by most of the cast. Now I know why the movie is generally available in the ""Bargain Rack"" at most discount department stores."
3,"New disc is NOT 16x9 enhanced, it's the same disc content as the old DVD","I own the old DVD released years ago by Republic Pictures, which was not 16x9 enhanced. Thus, if you own a newer Widescreen TV it will appear stretched and distorted.Seeing this new DVD released by Lions Gate, you are led to believe that it is a new 16x9 enhanced transfer, which it even states very clearly on the back cover of this new DVD edition as ""16x9 WIDESCREEN"".When I popped in the new DVD, imagine my surprise when I saw that it was in fact not 16x9 enhanced, but it is the SAME EXACT DISC CONTENT as the old Republic Pictures DVD release, right down to the generic menu!Thanks for nothing Lions Gate..."
3,Freeway Movie,Thw shopping was fast. There were a few issues with the DVD playing correctly. It would pause on and off during the beginning.
3,FLAW AT END OF MOVIE...,"...lessened what could have been a great dark comedy. Throughout the movie Witherspoon's character performs violent acts on people who cross her, but almost all is justified. I had empathy for her except at the gas station and at the end of movie where this unjustifiable act really spoils the happy ending(in truth she would go back to jail).The acting of Witherspoon is suprisingly top-notch. Except for the above, the plot is enjoyable. For the money, this is worth getting."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Freeway does a bunch of interesting things and is enjoyable enough to watch (in a perverse sort of way), but it never really comes together as a film and falls short of its potential."
4,RESSE WITHERSPOON IS OUTSTANDING!,"Reese Withrspoon gives the performance of a lifetime. She fits into the role of Vanessa Lutz like a shoe. She is so focused in this film on her character that she is so wonderful. Other actresses as young as Reese Witherspoon have not givin such a strong performance. Am I forgetting Kiefer Sutherland? Nope, he is a perfect villian who is so crazy in this film and his sinister presence really moves along the madness of his character. My opinion of this film is, it puts a little ol' Little Red Riding Hood desguise on and follows Reese witherspoon to her grandmothers house. She encounters the not-so-usaul-problems, but little more twisted problems then Riding Hood does. Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of a lifetime and this is really a great film. A must see for everyone. Its really a truthful film."
5,Reese is a psycho b-tch in this!!,"Reese Witherspoon is staggering in this movie...she plays a girl from the seedier side of life who at first just struggles and then decides to make things work FOR her, instead of being torn down. 'Freeway' was the rare film that honestly surprises you, so I won't give anything away.... but really, you have to see this movie. It's a Little Red Riding Hood fable gone 90's."
4,Really good,Kinda trashy;Reese W is my fave actress but it was a good flick BAD points:she dates a black guy in the flick and then he gets killed Good points:she kills the murderer
4,"A brutal, bloody trip","Where's the kinder and gentler Kiefer Sutherland of Lost Boys and Stand By Me? You're saying, ""Say what?"" Trust me, Kiefer was far more K&G in those 2 earlier films. This is a semi-twisted affair, with Reese Witherspoon as a SoCal white trash teen whose already lousy life is going to hell. The car she steals breaks down, & she gets a ride with the wrong dude, Sutherland. Brooke Shields is wonderfully shrill as his trophy wife. A great touch is when Witherspoon's character pulls out a photo of her father to show Sutherland, and it's a snap of Richard Speck, '60s Chicago nurse-killer. This is strong stuff."
4,actually fullscreen,"This DVD is actually fullscreen format.On a full screen tv, there will be bars on the top and bottom of the picture.On a widescreen tv, there will be bars on all four sides, if you set thePicture Size to 4:3 to view the movie with the proper aspect ratio.Depending on the player and the tv's capabilities, you may be able tochoose a picture size that will at least eliminate the bars on the left andright sides of the picture - while preserving the aspect ratio.My widescreen tv will only do this, via picture size 'Zoom1', if I lower theresolution by using a DVD player without 1080 upscaling. This entails usingcomponent video or other lower-resolution inputs instead of HDMI input."
5,Her Life Is No Fairy Tale,"Truculent 16-year-old Vanessa Lutz (Reese Witherspoon) handcuffs her social worker's hand to a bed after the police arrest Vanessa's mother and stepfather for drug possesion and solicitation.Vanessa then makes her way to her grandmother's house in Stockton, California when she meets a seemingly pleasant man Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) on the highway while having car trouble. Vanessa is unaware of the fact that Bob is in fact a serial rapist/killer preying on young women. Vanessa manages to use his own perverse tactics against him. After beating him to a pulp, she is arrested and sent to a juvenile detention center where there's lots of violence (including a very bloody catfight) and lesbianism.Overall, a very lurid, vulgar, explicit rendition of ""Little Red Riding Hood""...Reese was insane, in a good way! One of the best independent films of the 90s."
4,Indy Flick,This is what indie movies should be like. This movie is very edgy with some great directing. Reese Witherspoon dose a great job and nobody will look at her the same way again after her great performance. Kiefer Sutherland makes a lasting impression without an overkill in screen time and the story is exellent but very screwed up. A definate buy for anybody that enjoys a good quality moive that dose not depend on speicial effects.
5,"""Better than Expected","This movie was way better than I expected. I had no preconcieved ideas or thoughts going into the viewing of this film. It was a well balanced film considering the weight of it's message. If you like a movie that is a bit skewered, but with a whisper of irony and justice, then this is your movie."
4,The Tough Girls Version of Red Riding Hood,"I will never be surprised by anything Reese Witherspoon ever does, because after accidentally coming across this film on cable, I have seen that the girl can play any role with ferocious energy and credibility. In this film, Reeze plays a teenager on her way to Grandma's house, only to be accosted by a really bad dude played by Kiefer Sutherland. (Brooke Shields does a good job of playing his wife.) Not my kind of movie -- too gory and cynical -- but it was so astonishing and engrossing that I could not stop watching it all the way to the end.Reese, you go girl!"
3,Reese Witherspoon..,"This film is Reese Witherspoon's best effort. it all start when her mom is arrested for prostitution and she avoid going back to foster care by cuffing a children services representative. She decide to go to stay with her grandma in Stockton, while hitchiking she encounters a man named Bob Wolverton (played by Kiefer Sutherland) who turns out to be a serial killer. This fresh and unique film is hilighted by outrageous performences and crisp direction. Also starring: Amanda Plummer, Don Heyada, Michael T. Weiss, Brittany Murphy. Directed by:Matthew Bright. Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone executively produced this film. Originally Rated NC-17, but was cut down to a ""R"" Rating. Uncensored version not available on videocassette. MPAA Rating: R for strong violence, pervasive strong language, some explicit sexual dialogue, drug use, strong sexual content and brief nudity."
1,Reese makes me cringe...,"I could feel no remorse or empathy for Reese's character. Worst acting role for her.She came off with this high pitched whiny voice that just went through me.Reese was just not believable, if this was to be a tongue and cheek type movie it was really really bad.If it was to be a serious movie, it was really, really bad. Keifer is not a serial killer, just a creep. waste of time. don't bother."
1,way disgusting and horribly boring,"this is quite the disgusting movie. Reese Witherspoon is intense in this one but she cant help with its obnoxious characters and too many other horrible things. Sutherland is totally a bore and when hes had his surgery and his face is messed up and he has his vocalizer its so funny,...a total garbage infested movie, blecchhh"
1,Horrible,"This is the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I'm disgusted with Keifer Sutherland. There is so much blood and guts in this picture there is no room for anything else. It belongs in the trash not in the drama section in the video store.Comedy? you've got to be kidding! Sutherland ought to be ashamed of himself for making such a gross, trashy picture! My opinion of him has certainly gone down. He is not that hard up for cash that he has to degrade himself to that level. The one star is too much."
5,Take the ride....you won't be disappointed!,"Let me say up front, that I'm a fan of Reese Witherspoon. She's done a good job in a number of diverse roles from ""Fear"" to ""Election"". I personally think this is her best performance. Freeway is not a movie for everyone, the subject matter is quite confronting, and the violence is pretty graphic. However, the movie is first and foremost a dark comedy, and it's very funny! The scene in the courtroom with Reese and Keifer had me rolling on the floor. I've shown this movie to a number of friends, and without exception, they've all enjoyed the film. The sound and image quality are both excellent, which adds to the overall value of the DVD. To sum up, if you enjoy dark comedies, fine acting, and are not terribly sqeamish, then ""Freeway"" may be just the ticket for your next movie night."
4,Hello Ms. Witherspoon....,"...and boy what an introduction. This was my first time seeing Ms. Witherspoon and she blew my socks off. The movie is like a white trash/thriller/comedy roller coaster ride. The end got a little intense but you cannot ignore the talented young lady that held my interest through all her trials and tribulations. From trailor park to prison cell to killer of a serial killer, it won't let up for a moment."
3,enough already with false titles....,"While I'm glad there are more books on Muay Thai coming out, enough already with false titles. There is nothing ""advanced"" about this book. In fact, if you have spent more than a few months in any decent gym, you will find this a pretty boring bookI'm tired of so called instructional books filled with pictures of tourist sites, random pics of Thais standing around and pages of ""this is me with my coach"". Noe of that is instructional in nature, nor is advice on how to get a visa to Thailand....The technique is fairly basic, good quality pictures and if you are a beginner you will learn something, but the title is way off the mark"
2,This is not advanced!,"I was really disappointed in this book. I don't know who could benefit from it. It's too elementary for semi-advanced students but doesn't cover basics so it stinks for the beginner!The descriptions are a little vague and the photos do not explain much. There are a few great action shots but nothing you can learn from. There were too many ""portrait"" photos of Thai competitors.Overall I did learn a few things but it was not worth the read ...or the money."
3,Cooking with Spices,Item arrived on time. Only issue is that the begining of the book is coming a part...pages are coming loose from the binding.This was discoveredon xmas morning. I did not contact the seller about it because I did not want to deal with sending it back (paying to do so) so I just let it go.
2,Worth...but not.......,"Comprised primarily of trailers from films, this video is mediocre. Some enjoyable scenes are interspersed with the preview footage but are too short and too rare to salvage the whole."
3,Good b-side,"If you have not heard ""Vertigo"", then you have been living under a rock. The real catch, and what makes this cd-single better than Vertigo #2, is the b-side, which is a good (but not great tune) - a bit of a rocker, lyrically in the vein of ""Always"" (the b-side from ""Beautiful Day"") - and a nice addition to those who will be burning their own HTDAAB+ cd."
2,Who mastered this?,"Great rocking tunes - musically. There is no digital headroom though with the mix - its pegged to the max. The songs are extremely compressed to the point of distortion even at low volume. It sounds like someone deaf mastered these songs. Even the vocals are distorted. Maybe that's how they wanted it, but this seems to be the growing trend with all digital music - to see how much headroom can be squeezed out of digital levels to the point of low level distortion. Bottom line - the songs rock, but the audiophile in me says they sound like c-r-a-p. It would have sounded better having the band play in a garage and putting up 2 cheap microphones to capture the moment instead of wasting money on a deaf engineer :)"
3,Not really worth the purchase,"Let's face it... There are probably only a few reasons anyone would purchase this CD:1. You are a completist (and the rating doesn't matter)2. You want the B-Side.If you are in category 1, go for it (I did). If you are in category 2, save the money. The single version of Vertigo is not any different than the album version. The B-Side can probably be easily found on I-Tunes or other online dealer for around $1. In fact, I don't find this B-Side to be one of U2's better ones. It is a decent song, but is any song really worth a $10 plus purchase? In general, U2's B-Sides have shown a definite decline, probably because little work is put into their production making these B-Sides effectively little more than demos."
3,"Yeah, it sounds great, but . . .","Am I the only one who's noticed that it's virtually identical to ""You Keep Me Hanging On"" - sort of a combination of the Supremes and the Vanilla Fudge versions?"
3,I love this book,The Chocolate Touch by Patrick Catling is great.The main character is John and he loves chocolate he buys a piece of chocolate.He gets the chocolate touch.My favorite part is when he gets the chocolate touch.I recommend this book to anybody who likes chocolate.I love this book.
5,The Chocolate Touch,The Chocolate Touch by Patrick Catling is truly an awesome book! John Midas usually loves chocolate and will do anything to get it. But one day he gets the chocolate touch... now he needs to find a way to get rid of chocolate! My favorite part is when he gets the chocolate touch by eating a mystery chocolate. If you wish everything tastes like chocolate you might just change your mind! So if this sounds interesting you can grab The Chocolate Touch and Read! Read! Read!
4,The Bookworm Bandit's book review,"We read this book as part of an after school book club. In this book John Midas really likes chocolate.....and he has lots of problems with it! At the end of the book he learned his lesson - greediness is NOT a good thing. We think you should read this book, it is a really good book and it teaches you a very important lesson."
4,A sure winner,This was a great book that I enjoyed reading. The content of it was fictional but had very practical application to real life situations. The book is great for any age. I am 16 and was surprised to find how intriguing it was. I would recommend this book to anyone young and old.
5,It Was Great!,I thought the book was great at first. The book is about a little boy who loves chocolate. He finds a store and buys a piece. The chocolate makes him turn everything he touches into chocolate. My favorite part was when he was taking a test and his pencil turned into chocolate. The book was great!
3,A Sweet Book,"This book is about a boy named John Midas. He loves chocolate. This book will remind you of King Midas and the Golden Touch. I think if you like chocolate and lots of it you should read this book. John has a bad habit of chewing things. So when he goes to school he started chewing his glove and it turns into chocolate. But maybe you should check other reviews before you read it.Eliot, a second grader"
4,You'll turn to chocolate,I think the chocolate touch is a good book. This book is about a little boy named John he buys a big box of chocolateand there is only one piece of chocolate and he eats it and everything his lips touch turns into chocolate. suesan his girl friend did not know about it and they do not like each other any more.You should read it because you'll love it I did. It teachs you not to be so selfish and it also teechs to listen to other people.Megan Gibson
2,A tasty book,"The Chocolate Touch is an average book. I don't like the part when the main character (John Midas) eats Susan Buttercup's coin. She gets so, so, so angry she runs away and starts crying. Before John did what he just did, John made another person unhappy. The other person John made unhappy was Spider Wilson. Spider is a bully in John's school. John claimed whatever he touched with his lips turned into chocolate. I think it is an average book because there are some really boring parts.Antony, a second grader"
5,Get this book,I read this book in school in my second grade class. I thought it was sad in the middle because John M's mother turned into chocolate. It was funny when all his food turned to chocolate. I like this book because there are lots of good vocabulary words in it.
4,A greedy boy gets his 'just desserts'!,"I read this book for the first time when I was in third grade, and recently bought it for my niece who is currently in fourth grade. It's a cute story about a boy named John Midas, who loves chocolate so much that he'd rather eat that alone than anything else in the world. One day, he finds a special coin in the street and goes to a candy shop where the storekeeper sells him a big box of the sweetest, chocolatiest chocolate he's ever tasted. I won't give away any more of this story...all I'll say is that John Midas quite literally gets his 'just desserts'. I liked the book a lot, both then and now, and I think your children will, too."
5,Direct From Broadway does it again and I hope it'll make a great part of the collection!,"I already got three ""Direct From Broadway"" plays such as Jekyll & Hyde: The Musical, Putting It Together and Smokey Joe's Cafe and I bet this one will be the finale part of the collection if I do get it that is."
3,happy to see the live production,"The Sophisticated Ladies is such a rarity and treat, you almost forgive the the director, cameramen and producers. I 'm sure they did the best they could but the fact that it's a live play captured on video constantly has you forgiving the quality. Phyllis Hyman is simply breathtaking, she completely commands the stage, you want her in every scene. Paula Kelly shows why she was such a triple threat, dancer, singer and actress. She seemed destined to lead in a producttion of Chicago, the other cast members were fair and the dancing was okay, The Tony nominated performance of Phyllis Hyman is a must for you dvd shelves."
4,Awesome production of a great man,This DVD showcase the awesome gift/ talent of the Duke. Very enjoyable and great for history lesson.
2,Very basic,"Very basic. Useful to build some intuition, but clearly insufficient to grasp the subject. Do not reccommend it for someone looking for even a minimum technical content"
3,Wordy descriptions of distributions,"I had the Kindle edition, which had issues with square boxes where mathematical symbols like less than should have been. Not everywhere, but enough times to be very annoying.In the chapters describing the distributions like the geometric distribution -- the book did not seem to get to the point. You really had to wade through a lot of unnecessary verabage, in my opinion. This was in the latter part of the book.Other areas seemed pretty strong, especially the first half of the book."
4,Probability,"Seems like a ""basics"" course. Not as casual as it might seem. You have to take notes if you really want to learn!"
1,evolution for dummies,"I hate it. Both probability for Dummies, and Evolution for dummies, are much too dificult to understand, without a background in mathematics-algebra, calculus, on evolution, a background in genetics, dna, rna is required to understand-definitely neither are a basic course or reference. I quit reading both, and would like to sell them back-unused, like new condition."
3,Introduction to space dynamics,"I bought this book because I need to know about kinematics and dynamics of missiles. Yes, this book covers that, but you should be well familiar with vector algebra and kinematics before you start with this book!!! I had forgotten a lot of that, and the short repetition in the first chapters in this book became too heavy. All chapters seems to have much concentrated text with much mathematics. Each chapter contains problems, but there is no fasit to them... But in spite of this, I think this is a good book at all."
4,Must own- nearly a 5,"A couple dud tracks keep this from being a 5, but the good tracks are great.The version of Nice and Warm Tab Benoit laid down for this is better than the original release, and as close to live as you'll get, and Clarence Gatemouth Brown will raise the hair on the back of your neck with The Drifter.Interspersed between some serious blues is some more folksy stuff and some nice piano work from Dr. John, but the whole album works very well as a whole for a collaboration. In time, you'll find that the powerful Brother Can You Spare a Dime is as much a favorite as the more raucus, gritty work by Benoit and Gatemouth. The samples selected to listen to don't really convey how good this album is.As I type this there are used copies for $2.99- buy one already."
4,Great stuff!,"Though I could've done without the stunt casting of Britney, How I Met Your Mother Season 3 didn't disappoint! (Plus, since it came back post-strike there are more episodes than a lot of series, so more bang for your buck!) This series continues to be one of my favorites that I can watch over & over whenever I need a little pick me up! Highly recommend it!!"
4,"Let's face it, you're hooked. Just buy this.","This is one of the best shows on TV, and sadly I discovered it late. However, I to get the benefit of watching them in quick succession on DVD. My only complaint is that the bonus content, aside from commentaries, is fairly sparse by today's standards. The fact is you can finish everything within a couple of days. Still, it's more than worth the price. Just pick it up."
5,How i met your mother is legen wait for it dairy,A Lot of people say that the third season is only okay and not up to the qaulity to the first two seasons but i think that its better than the other two seasons. they were both great but i think that this one is better and the fetures on this set is amazing too. This season reminded me alot like scrubs style which is a great show and i officly think that after this season and the fourth and fifth that i ve seen that it can become in the ranks of sienfeld friends cheers A.D 30 rock the office scrubs and i'm pretty sure the big bang theory modern family and glee will be with it soon and the honey moon videos or great and some great episodes or the third whell slaps giving there hilarious
5,This season is...wait for it...AWESOME!,"How I Met Your Mother is one of my favorite shows so I've bought all three seasons on DVD so far. There isn't as many episodes on season three (due to the writer's strike), but the show itself is just as good as ever."
4,Set is as expected,"Nothing wrong with the quality of the set physically, exactly as one expects from a series DVD box these days. An enjoyable season, but that is less objective than the actual item condition."
5,a tv series definitely worth owning,"what can i say to add to everyone else's reviews - it is 100% worth owning. i bought this in october of last year and have gone through the dvds maybe 3 times so far. you can watch barney & company over and over again and not get tired of these episodes!as for how this one rates against the other seasons, season2 is still my favorite, but owning all 3 is highly recommended!"
3,overall good,"This was shipped very quickly, but the 3rd disk skips some, which is pretty annoying and I'm sure I did not scratch it as all I did was move it from the case to the dvd player once. The other disks were fine. I would probably buy from this seller again as long as the item is new and not used at all."
5,I love How I Met Your Mother,"Lets just say that I watched this season within two days. You can't go wrong with this show, great writers and great actors."
4,One of the best on TV,"Great show, great characters! You will absolutely love this show. It drops a little from the 2nd season but still a must have in the library."
2,Shattered case,The DVDs were in good condition but the case and the plastic flap inside were broken.
5,Yummy Fresh Berries,I've just got these plates and I really love them.I'm planning to order the complete set.
4,Handy and Well-Organized,"This is a ""pocket-sized"" guidebook to one of the most civilized cities I've ever visited. It is organized very well, breaking the ""tourist parts"" of the city into color coded zones, with nicely detailed descriptions of each of the zones. Amsterdam has great public transit and the guide has a good description of the tram lines and how to use them. In the back there is a pocket which contains a very nice fold out map--on one side there is a ""day"" map of Amsterdam and on the other a ""night"" map. Each side reflects the activities available at each time, with colored markers for the type of activity and their locations. You really don't need any other guide, this one is pretty comprehensive."
1,"Can't write ""thick & thin"" with this!","It didn't come with the right calligraphy points -- One of my co-worker who is an artist took a look and she say there's no way you can write ""thick and thin"" with the points it came with. So much for spending [money] for a bottle of ink."
3,A good record,"I listened to this cd nearly every day over the summer. Made me wish I had a hammock. Anyway, this record came to me very highly recommended. I think it is good, but couldn't possibly live up to what I'd heard about it. Mostly its a kind of mellow British pop stuff, but its interesting and the songs tend to build in a way that most 'pop' does not. Also, the songs tend to be rather long (6 minutes in some cases). I've heard comparisons to My Bloody Valentine, but I think the 2 bands share only a little in common. January are less noisy, more tuneful, more accessible, and a bit happier sounding."
4,much help in teaching,This book has many helpful ideas for elementary teachers (and parents) in teaching religious concepts in a fun way. It can be incorporated into any existing teaching curriculum.
5,great fitting boot!,"I was looking for another type of boot that would protect my feet and ankles while riding my motorcycle. I came across these and really loved the western inspired look of these boots! I was a bit concerned as they were not offered in women's sizes, however the sizing guide showed me how to choose my size and the fit is perfect! They are comfortable, offer great support and protection for my piggly wigglies. I am not a ""fashionista"", however, have gotten some really neat compliments from friends as they are not the typical motorcycle boot. I would order again as the price was extremely reasonable as these boots are made of leather, detailed stitching and the soles are welt construction and very heavy. Water proof or resistant as well. Cannot go wrong with this boot for this purpose! Thanks Amazon!"
3,"Interesting, but not much of a story.","...it's more like a comic book essay. Alan Moore has written some of the best comics stories I've ever read, but other things he writes go completely over my head. This one falls primarily into the ""over my head"" category. These are the same creators who brought us the excellent FROM HELL, but the BIRTH CAUL doesn't resemble that story much. It has no real characters or plot; and if there's an argumentative point it makes, I can't say what the point is.That's not to say it's all bad, or even mostly bad. Some of the passages really sank in for me and kept me reading. It definitely affects your mood and makes you think, a bit, about how you are living your life."
3,"Not ""crystal clear""","Fits perfectly and definitely gives the grip the slippery Legend needs. However, mine is not crystal clear, it looks sort of yellowish. Phone looks great but the yellowish case looks kind of ""cheap""."
3,Triazzle,"Once you do all the puzzles, they're no fun anymore. They all have bugs and frogs. There are no penguins or anything like the real puzzles. it is fun the first time around but the real thing is better."
2,I would not buy again,"Rather flimsy and overpriced. I would buy for 20 bucks, but not any more than that. I expected more from Bear Archery."
1,Not what was pictured.,We wanted a bow and arrow set like was pictured.Not knowing the bear Archery Recurve Bow meant Quiver only.
3,small groups,Have not had a chance to look at the book yet. We are small group leaders and we were looking up older books to get new ideas.
1,A Sad Disappointment,"This game has so much potential, but it really falls flat. As soon as it loads up, the response of the arrow to the movement of the mouse is delayed about fifteen seconds. Not only that, but the climber on the screen fails to respond to your directions. I'm surprised Power Bar lent its name to such a [poor] product. Save your money."
4,Very nice journal,"I expected it to be a very small journal for the low price I paid, but I was pleased to find that it was standard size. Very nice leather with ribbon page mark and colorful Gorey cats on every page."
3,Dreamy minimalism,"Cyclical soundscapes with indecipheral female vocals, reportedly singing in an obscure Spanish dialect, MUS's music will put you in a trancelike state. It's new age pop for non new-age people, perfect for writing, painting or making out."
2,Drippy nozzle...,"This sprayer has a very drippy nozzle. Forget using this to spray pesticide inside your house. Each time you stop spraying, it leaves a small puddle on the floor. I decided to go for the absolute best sprayer for pesticide. The B&G Sprayer. It's the Rolls Royce of sprayers. No drip and extremely fine and precise nozzle spray."
5,Suddenly one captures the reader,"Suddenly one was taken is an excellent book - It is a ""short story"" compared to others like it (ie.Left Behind) The great thing about this book is that it's beginning pages give a description of what it felt like being raptured. The book holds your attention from chapter one to the very end. I was kind of disappointed about the ending but all in all a very good story and probably quite accurate, but we won't know until it happens."
3,Another decent way to entertain kids,"I have three Semsame Street CD's, and although this one is good...I would have to say it is my least favorite of the three. Of course, there are a couple great songs, but some others are lacking mainly because they have kids singing it and not really the SS characters themselves. I would reccomend the Platinum Songs, then the Kids Fav Songs 1 first. Then this one."
3,Not enough Elmo,"My daughter is 5 mos. old and loves Elmo, but this cd didn't show him enough. She wasn't interested in the other characters as much and got bored very easily."
2,It Is Cheap For a Reason,"I was a little leary of this version of the Joker Tube because the cost was so much lower than elsewhere. But, based on reviews stating that it is of high quality, I made the purchase. The Gung Ho box fell apart as soon as I took it out of the box. The priority balls were a bit dented, but in ok shape. I am not sure if these are factory rejects of just very poor quality. If you are trying to save some money and don't mind a few minor repairs, then this product is a good choice. Otherwise, I would recommend paying full price and getting a set in one piece."
4,He's Genuine,"I haven't lived in New Orleans in a while, but I did live there long enough to recognize real Tiptinas style cuts, when I hear them. This guy delivers that sound, in grand style. If you are a fan of N'Awlins style soul/blues, as I am, this CD will give you your fix. Blues fans of Keb Mo will hear some similarities. Tab's guitar playing has that similar ""fuzzy"" quality to it. But Tab is definitely on a tighter track when he kicks out the Albert Collins riffs on ""Too Many Dishes."" It's almost as if I were put into a Sherman and Peabody wayback machine to a live Tips/Collins gig, via 1983.Fans of Collins, Professor Longhair, Stevie Ray, The Dirty Dozen, and other performers of the era will be happy to see that Todd Benoit and similar groups are maintaining that kind of quality!BEK"
5,"Tab Throws A Party, Louisiana Style!","Swampland Jam was recorded at the House of Blues, New Orleans, Louisiana on February 23, 1997, and what a party that must have been.Benoit is joined by several cajuns including, Chubby Carrier on ""Hot Tamale Baby"", Jumpin' Johnny Sansone on """"Louisiana Style"" and ""Crawlin' King Snake"", Henry Gray on ""Two Many Dishes"" and Raful Neal on ""Garbage Man"". Six of the twelve songs are Tab and his band without the guests. All songs are excellent, but my personal favorite is ""Dirty Dishes"" which features some nice piano playing By Henry Gray which quietly compliments the slow blues guitar playing and vocals of Benoit.Fan noise is kept to a minimum although there is no doubt that the CD captures a live and enthusiastic crowd in attendance."
3,DIdn't Meet Expectations,"After seeing Tab Benoit in concert twice and reading some of the other reviews here, I was expecting a really hot disc. Boy was I disappointed. The performances are sedate, the crowd seems bored and after a few tracks, so was I. Even ""Hot Tamale Baby"" seems to have been performed in slo-mo. It just isn't anything like what his shows give you in person. I'm still a huge fan, but I'll be sure to go for a studio release next time. I'd recommend others do the same."
1,Doesn't do its job,This auger is piece of (s)crap. Cutting edges are not sharp and they are installed at wrong angle so first other edge comes in contact with soil. If you want to dig a hole you basically have to push auger into ground because blades are not cutting soil.
4,Makes perfect holes,"The post hole digger arrived in time for the weekends job of building two privacy screens. It cuts easy through dirt and sand. If you have rocks in the ground, you'll have to remove those by hand. My only complaint is that the auger has no depth markings, so I used electricians tape to mark every foot and 6""."
5,Absolutely superb!,"I'd never heard this guy before I found this CD in the used section of a local store. Boy, what a surprise I got. His playing and singing is simple fantastic. Backed by an excellent set of musicians (who incidently include Reese Wynans - SRV's keyboardist), Tab explores the 12 bar blues with style, humor and feeling. His tone is awesome and his voice is so, so good that this guy deserves much more recognition and exposure. Every track is a gem. Buy it today - you'll thank me tomorrow! :) I've just ordered his other CDs."
3,"OK, but disappointing","I thought it was short of information and long on meaningless pictorials.I gave it 3 stars because what it presents is bare bones basic but accurate. I am a new student of the Bible, and this did not present new information for me. Maybe I just expected too much because I was so enthusiastic about the topic :)While this is no substitute for reading the Bible, it is a good and accurate start that will hopefully whet your appetite to read more of it because there is more information in the Bible which ties the Old and New Testaments together than this.I apologize if I sound ungrateful, as I sincerely appreciate their efforts in this great, necessary and somewhat difficult topic. The world could certainly could use more efforts along these lines."
1,"Very Little Devito, Too Much Raunchy Non-Talent","I'd never seen this movie and started watching it just because I like Danny Devito in most movies I've seen. Well, you'll see very little of Devito in this. He leaves the house with his wife near the movie's beginning to get away from their two raunchy worthless sons, and except for a brief scene here and there you'll not see him again. Instead, the bulk of the movie focuses on the two ""young adult"" sons. There is absolutley nothing redeeming in this movie if you have half a brain, and what little humor there is falls into the category of crude, raunchy, unintelligent, 10 levels below the Three Stooges. It's an absolute waste of time. Skip it. I'd give it 0 stars if there were such a thing."
4,"Gift Item, Housebroken Video","I sent this video to a friend and she really enjoyed thisas a birthday gift. She is 86 and said she played it threetimes because she was laughing so much in the previous viewings,she missed some dialogue. Thanks for making this serviceavailable. Kathleen"
1,Not realistic,"I did not enjoy this movie, because it was not realistic nor educational, and most important it was not funny much of the humor was actually disturbing."
1,where's the real Doyle Bramhall,"I don't really need to say a lot, except that the blues-based, lyrical Doyle Bramhall that I know and like, is nowhere to be found on this CD. Sorry, but to me it was nothing more than a bunch of un-inspired genre-neutral ramblings. It got to the point that half-way through, I just started skipping track after track, each of which sounded no different than the one before."
2,"Talent galore, needs song writer.","I'm a fan, but not enough so that I could recommend this CD. It seems that with every passing effort, Bramhall gets a little worse. He's got a great voice, he plays a great guitar,....but the songs are just out and out mediocre.If you don't own anything by Bramhall, get the Arc Angels first, his debut solo second, then flip a coin over the two most recent. I'll continue to hope that he fulfills his potential with the next release."
5,Yes! Great CD!,"I love this album. This is good friggin' rock and roll. A great band, awesome guitar playing, and great vocals. Why was Green Light Girl not a big hit?? Why didn't this album sell a million copies? Well, screw Top 40. Let them have their Christina Aguilera. Fans of real rock and roll should delight in this CD. This is the kind of rock that they just don't make much anymore. The Black Crowes are gone, Aerosmith has gone pop and the Stones haven't done anything noteworthy in two decades. But we do have Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Doyle Bramhall II and for that we should be grateful. If you like KWS, then definitely check this CD out. A good time is guaranteed for all."
4,"Excellent, well-rounded album. Buy it!","Doyle has been trying to shake the SRV wannabe moniker for some time, and I think his last two albums have done just that. The album starts out with his single ""Green Light Girl"". The first thing you'll think when you hear it is Lenny Kravitz. It has that kind of a vibe to it. Nothing extraordinary or new...but not bad at all. I can just see the record execs telling Doyle to at least put one song on the album that sounds like something you'd hear on modern radio. ""Green Light Girl"" is that song. ""Problem Child"" is very good. My kinda guitar. The song goes from slow, blues-inspired, Hendrix-like guitar riffs to an all out guitar frenzy..and then back again. Probably my favorite song on the album. I'm not going to go on to describe each song...but it is mixed bag of a variety of different styles. Very good, solid album. It's a shame that it'll probably not sell over 500,000 copies. It's not the type of music that radio will give a chance...and that's a shame."
5,Under-rated,"This is a great CD!! I tend to catch myself returning to it when I take another CD out of my player. Seems the more you listen ,the better it gets and I've got an extensive collection of music."
4,great product,more words are needed but this is a great reference book for words to translate to english
4,Nice Work,"I found this book to be a good defence of the “big 5.” James White is a very thorough writer and presents his rebut of “Chosen But Free” with a tiny hint of sarcasm that only adds to this work. Easy to read, nice lay out and well research Calvinist material. Dr. White is so convincing that I had to keep telling myself, “it is systematic theology, as long as I follow the system he is using I will end up with the same conclusions.” One thing to keep in mind when reading this book is that any system of theology will work if you are viewing the Bible alone outside of the Holy Tradition of the early Church."
5,White 1; Geisler 0,"White's book THE POTTER'S FREEDOM leaves Geisler with no excuses. The numerous fallacies and outright misrepresentations in Geisler's book have been exposed for all the world to see.In addition, White has done a masterful job of presenting the Reformed faith for those who are interested in knowing what it really is."
2,Single Minded,"James White writes with a single minded attitude: Defend the reformed position at all costs, even if it means throwing out Biblical truth. This whole book is about refuting Norman Geisler's book CHOSEN BUT FREE. James White does what he is best at which is to focus in on certain texts that support his position and attempts to obscure passages that clearly and decisively show that he is wrong. He can't seem to understand that God, by His sovereign grace, has given us a free will- or at least it's a point he has never pondered in Scripture. If you have already bought into Calvinism and are trying to feel good about that decision then this book is for you. If you want to know God, rather then just a dogma, spend your money elseware."
1,Geisler's Response to The Potters Freedom,"Please be aware that Norman Geisler responded to ""The Potters Freedom"" in his latest version of ""Chosen But Free."" He devotes an entire chapter to rebutting White's book. In his rebuttal, Geisler lists a HUGE list of mistakes in White's book. If one is truly serious about this subject, he should read BOTH books. I find Geisler's viewpoint much more compelling and scripturally supported."
1,The Stupidity of Arminians,"One wonders if Arminians really believe in sola scriptura or scripture plus feelings. I've read the book twice, and I think it's a great book. Although there has been more detailed works out there on the subject, I think White does a great job refuting Geisler. One arminian reviewer writes, ""Note the out-cry of Calvinists against his work...if it was so blatantly wrong, then there would be no need for this silly attempt at a rebuttal."" Not putting Reformed works on equal terms with scripture, but the Apostles themselves wrote against stuff that was ""so blatantly wrong,"" that there was a need to correct. I believe Geisler is one of those cases.. Read ""Chosen but Free"" and ""The Potters Freedom,"" but if you are already convinced that Arminians is right, then you will seek to find proof for it. But so far, Geisler and Arminians really don't have a leg to stand on."
4,"Opened my eyes, but some of the answers to questions do not meet expectation","This is a comprehensive book about what's important for developing reading skills. I came across this book from the book recommendation from my son's school. While reading this book, I realized that the school is following a lot of the concepts in this book, which actually built up my son's reading skills. I would say that this is a book that all parents with small children should read. The area for improvement lies in the answers to the questions in the book. Simply put, the answers are not skimmer friendly. You really need to read everything she writes instead of using skimming skills. In this era of information flood, people appreciate a book that allows skimming for information. For example, when a yes/no question is posed, answer yes or no first, then elaborate, instead of just elaborating."
2,Disappointing,"When I first clapped eyes on the beautiful (supposed) cover by Eric Powell, I was sold. I'm a big fan of Westerns and of Powell's artwork and sense of humor, so this seemed like an easy sell.The first bit of disappointment hit when I received the book. The cover was not the Powell cover that Amazon shows. Instead it was done by a different artist. This development lead quickly to more disappointment as I found that all of the art was done by this same guy. Now, he's not a terrible artist or anything, but I would have much rather seen Powell's art carry the story. I didn't care for the actual artist's style much.More disappointment came when I found that the story had none of the Powell humor I came to love by reading his Goon series. And with a name like Billy the Kid's Old-Timey Oddities, you expect a bit of that humor.I quickly turned around and sold the book to someone else, so no harm done. But I'd love to see Powell tackle a Western-themed book all by himself."
4,Fast & Easy,I purchased (2) of the same kit's for gifts this Christmas..I find it easy and fast to do. The yarn doesn't shed like others I have done and the color is nice!
5,There's nothing like it...except another King and Moore,"Glen Moore (best known from his days with Oregon) and Nancy King deliver an exceptionally eccentric and downright fun LP's worth of bass and vocals. This disk and their earlier album, ""Potato Radio"" are honestly like nothing you've ever heard before, and still I've yet to play it for anyone who hasn't been entranced by it."
3,Kidnapped,"I had an odd chance to see this film, and thought it was OK. The Amazon 3rd party price is pretty hefty, as I write. In his recent memoirs, ""The Elephant to Hollywood"" Michael Caine brushes Kidnapped aside as a distressing memory: ""... a dud from the very start, and the only film I've never been paid for."""
4,Slightly biased review from a distant relative,"The Rev Dr. Donald Caskie was not a novelist, but he wrote well and he lived a remarkable life. The first half of this book is the story of how he, as a leader of the Church of Scotland in occupied France, operated part of an ""underground railway"" to rescue Allied POWs and get them to safe ground. The situations he describes are scary, funny, and profound. The last half of the book takes a very different turn (spoiler). I am ordering the book now from Amazon because I haven't read it in a while, but I recall quite a few spiritual passages while he was in prison. He simply tried to live his life and be the man he was under terrible circumstances. Maybe 40 or more years ago there was a movie made of this book, and there was an announcement last year that the BBC would be doing a new mini-series of the story, but I haven't seen it yet."
1,Not a good product,"I got this for my sister last year for Christmas, the DVD never worked. It wasn't worth the battle to get it replaced. I hate returning things. I tried it in a few DVD players, nothing ever came up. Not a good product."
2,Doesn't even pretend to be sharp.,"There is absolutely no way you can use this thing out of the box. It is just stupidly dull. Think butter knife dull.It may work after sharpening, but that could take a while because this thing is serrated."
2,Blade unacceptably dull,"It works, but requires far more effort than it should because the blade is really dull. I should have paid more attention to the low-rated reviews."
2,Not Sharp,"Grass whip has good length, good handle, and overall it's built to last. However, the serrated edges themselves are not sharp, so how am I supposed to cut grass? Of course they can be sharpened, but they should have already been sharpened."
3,Should be sharper,You have to swing it very hard and fast because it is not sharp enough. It is good enough for light trimming.
2,Too blunt.,"The grass whip did as advertised but it is too dull to cut through many weeds. I would probably buy this again, but without as many expectations."
1,Don't waste your money,This whip is terrible. It has NO edge at all. A butter knife has a sharper edge. In fact a butter knife would work better. Save your money.
3,Disappointed,"The tool is NOT sharpened and has thick paint on it.It does cut if you swing it fast enough.somewhat on the flimsy side.I will keep it and sharpen it.But since I have to sharpen it, I would rather be spending my time sharpening the Bully brand (Which also has thick paint and needs sharpened)The trick now is trying to sharpen a serrated edge...almost need a round file..."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected this tool to be SHARP to cut grass. It is not sharp, at all. It cuts fairly rigid weeds OK, but not grass and not hardier seedlings.I would have returned it but it was such a hassle and expense!"
2,good for upper body workout,"There is no sharpened edge on this. Great for an upper body workout, but won't substitute for a good goat!"
1,grass flattener,"I had medical issues that kept me out of my garden for nearly three weeks. Needless to say the grass and weeds got way out of control. Since I've been trying to be green, I decided to order a grass whip instead of a string trimmer. What a disappointment. It was so dull! It didn't cut anything. No matter how hard I swung the darn thing, all it did was flatten the grass and weeds. Oh well, all was not lost. Once the the grass was laying flat between the rows of vegetables; I found it pretty easy to cut and rake the weeds with my garden shears and ho."
2,Buy American,"As a kid I used a grass whip on my parent's property. It was great! This whip is made in China. Is too short. Did not have blade sharpened; I had to sharpen it. It does the basic work but not like those of my youth. In California they don't sell this type of tool at home improvement stores; only a clunky, heavy facsimile. No good. Was happy that I found it on Amazon. But next time I'll buy the Bully Tools grass whip made in USA (Bully #92399) and have a better tool. I should have researched first."
1,One of the Most Useless Items I've Ever Bought,"The Seymour WE-30 Grass Whip performs poorly. You flail away at a patch of long grass, and at the most you'll tear out a few tufts. The grass is torn by the force of the blow, not cut cleanly, which is unhealthy for the grass. The only purpose for this tool I can see is to roughly trim certain kinds of tall, soft weeds."
1,Literally falls short and is dull to boot!,"I bought the weed whip because I thought it was the longest, but the length given turned out to have been measured down the handle and back to the heel of the blade, then out to the tip: in reality, it is only long enough for a person 5 feet high or less. They also should give us a sharpening file to go with it because it the blades are so dull they could not cut tofu.Please, some one!!! Make a really long weed whip for tall people and make the blades sharp. I hate noisey electric and gas equipment, but the manual tools are so poor we are forced to waste fossil fuel or let things go. Rise, Ye Sea Slugs!"
4,It does what its supposed to do!,"Nothing fancy, but it works fine. Its not sharp, so you're not going to cut yourself. Probably not the best choice for large areas of tall grass, but for a small yard or just knocking down some weeds, it does the job"
3,Beware:It is not as strong as Source Naturals Oil of Oregano!,"This product is ok.....just ok but it is not as strong as Source Naturals Oil of Oregano which I found to be much more effective in helping me fight off colds and other troublesome winter ailments. If you have never used Oil of Oregano, I don't think you will be disappointed but I would definitely recommend the Oil of Oregano by Source Naturals over this brand."
1,"After a week, I had to quit.","It gave me headaches and problems with my equilibrium. After a week, I had to quit and immediately the headaches and dizziness stopped. I tried this product twice and the same thing happened with two different bottles. Wish I could get my money back."
5,Sinus Infections No More,"I used to get sinus infections 5 to 6 times a year and each one lasted 4 to 6 weeks. I'd finally go to my doctor for an antibiotic to wipe out the out-of-control infection. About six years ago one of my sisters gave me a bottle of Oreganol as a birthday gift! She did caution me that it took getting used to because it is strong. At that first sign, you know the one when you get that feeling you might be coming down with something, that's when to take the Oreganol. I haven't had a sinus infection ever since!"
5,very satisfied,Couldn't get this locally. Decided to look online. I am very happy with product. good price. exactly what I needed.
1,Did not work for me,"I purchased this product to deal with a plantar wart, and had high hopes after all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. I used it topically twice a day for three weeks. It made the wart smaller but did not get rid of it. When I came back to read the reviews again, I noticed that many people posted when they had just started using Oreganol and it had made their warts smaller, but very few actually said it made their warts disappear. I guess I was overly optimistic. I'm now going to try Compound W and duct tape!"
1,doesn't work,poor product.... doesn't do anything to help psoriasis ... a scam at best.. don't buy and waste your money. Where is truth in advertising?
5,Excellent!,"This stuff is great, If you have a sore throat or a cold, gargle and it will heal it immediately! I've gotten use to the taste and I think it helps my chronic fatigue ALOT! Love it!"
5,Amazing Stuff,"I got sick so often before this stuff. Did my research and purchased it. Havent been sick in a year and a half. Oncen a year, I start to get sick and then boom, gone after a day and only got one symptom.I use an empty capsule and put one to two drops for my 4 year old in it and she takes it. Being in daycare and a HUGE flu going around our city, she hasnt been sick in a year and a half. One day for 24 hours, she had a temp of 102ish. Her little body fought it right off. This is great stuff! HIGHLY recommend."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I understand that healthy products do not always taste good, but this stuff ranks as the worst thing I have ever tasted, and I used to taste many things I should not have when I was an infant. I would not recommend buying this products, unless you just want it to sit on your shelf, and that would just make you shelfish."
5,Powerful!,I can breath! I don't have azma anymore! Miraculous. From God's garden. I am so grateful I found out about this.
5,No Amer Tea & Herbal,This is one of the best products on the market. I recommend it for the treatment of arthritis related pain.
5,I have purchased and reviewed this many times.,"I have purchased and reviewed this many times from N. American Herb & Spice through Amazon. This will be the last time I review it but not the last time I buy it! I hate to use the word ""miracle"" but that is what this oil of oregano is if you are plagued by severe post nasal drip when you wake up in the morning. If you are spitting up mucous in the morning try putting about 6 drops of this in about 1 ounce of ice tea or other beverage after dinner or just before bed. In about a week I think you will see vast improvement. It not only worked for me but has worked for 3 other people I know. All of them are really thankful."
5,As good as you've heard,"I've used this for everything from rashes to flu-like symptoms. It's strong, versatile, and does the job. I honestly would feel lost without this stuff. Highly recommended."
5,A+,If amazon requires me to leave an actual review besides A+ and won't allow me to just keep repeating A+ then I'm just going to leave a pointless review.
5,Mikey likes it and I do too.,"I had a big ? at first, but once it learned to use it,WOW. Get the hole stared and get the ground moist and dig dig dig."
1,Where's the beef?,"Desperate to learn more about the genesis of the condition that plagues my 7 year old boy, I was upset to find that apparently this answer does not exist. I found it terribly misleading to entitle the book ""Why Johnny can't write."" Unfortunately, in the thirty minutes that it took to read the book from cover to cover I didn't learn any insight into the condition or any new techniques on how to best deal with it. This book does a decent job at providing a rudimentary understanding on the issues related to dysgraphia. It would be better off entitled ""Helpful hints when Johnny can't write""."
2,Dysgraphia,This is a short pamphlet which impresses me as a lesson plan or teacher's notes published as a book. Its not worth the price.
1,Don't waste your money!,"You get 50 pages of overpriced info. Very little was of value. Chapter six was highly offensive to parents, and should either be removed or divided into two parts. The one given; From the School perspective, and part two; From a parents perspective. --- Had I looked at this book in a store I would not have spent my money on it. If I could get a refund, I'd return it in a heartbeat."
3,"Starts Well, But Sags At The End","As one who really got into the Coen Brothers after ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", I was looking forward to this movie. It is set in modern times, but it is set in the South as was ""O Brother"". Tom Hanks fills the role of the G.H. Dorr, PhD, who is the verbose character similar to Ulysses Everett McGill in ""O Brother"". There are many laughs throughout the movie; however, one could argue that it is mostly cheap humor, e.g. having a character that suffers from IBS. Mrs. Munson (Irma P. Hall) is a great rendition of the innocent, Southern Baptist ""Church Lady"". She doesn't want anything to do with hippity hop language or music.The story moves along nicely for most of the movie, but it's as if the Coen Brothers found that they had run out of time and had to end the movie quickly. The resolution comes about rather quickly and leaves one wondering what happened to the entertaining movie I was watching. For most people this is probably more of a rent than a buy."
4,Quirky Amusement,"Coen dark comedy starring Tom Hanks, who at first I thought was miscast, but who I now think was pitch perfect. Marlon Wayans as Gawain was so funny too. And I adore the Edgar Allan Poe quotes.DORR: You sir, are a Buddhist. Is there not a middle way?GENERAL: Must float like a leaf on the river of life...and kill old lady."
3,"Not a good comedy, even with an ""open mind""","Well, I see this film has to be viewed with an open mind. Of course you have to understand that overacting of the characters is the essence of the film, but it gets to an annoying level. And more from Tom Hanks (Prof. Dorr), who is really boring.All five in the ladykillers' gang are supposed to behave ridiculously and the only ""serious"" character is Irma Hall. But the distance is too large. Hanks's character was to give cohesion between her and the rest of the group, but his role is even more disgusting than the other four.The plot is really interesting, and of course the location is wonderful. I enjoyed the way Prof. Dorr gets together the gang, the robbery and the assault and the way the gang is ""dissolving"". But the interpretation is not what it must be.I know this flim must be seen as a cartoon, somewhat caricaturesque. But it was too much for me."
2,"Awkward comedy, uneven at best.","Take away the usual stunning cinematography and some very capable acting from the leads and you have sluggish, sometimes witty, unnecessarily profane project that was just not thought out completely. The Coen brothers have made some great films but this seems like a rush job unfortunately when watching this movie time seems to stand still. Only for die hard Coen fans and not suitable for children or anyone that doesn't care for profane thug language with a church lady in the next scene."
2,a bit disipointing,this movie was ok but it had way to much cursing and it was not funny.this movie is not sutible for young chirlden.the only reason i am giving this movie two stars enstead of one is because it had tom hanks.if marlon wanes would of been left out this movie it would be a preaty good film.
3,It's...different...,"If you believe all of the hype advertised in the trailors for this movie, you will be disappointed. This movie is not a drop dead funny movie, hence, all of the reviews that complain that this film drags on...and it does drag on in spots...What makes this movie worth seeing is that it is a departure from what we see and expect in movies that currently grace the screen. I enjoyed this film probably a little bit more than the average viewer because I respected that the movie was different.The fact that it was different, however, didn't mean that the movie was free of faults. The movie did drag on in spots due to the long-winded-ness of Hanks' character and the naivity of the leading lady. The humor in the film was a times childish (ie- the IBS guy and the stereotypical young black guy).If you're in the mood for something different and aren't expecting a fall-to-your-knees-laughing comedy, this might be worth your time..."
2,Not nearly as good as the original,"I love the Coen brothers, but this is probably their most disapointing offering. I always question why remakes are made when the original is so good. This movie has none of the heart or humour of the original"
2,Not as good as it should be,"A movie starring Tom Hanks as a verbose con man, renting a room from a sweet Mississippi lady, and using it to tunnel underground to the counting room of a casino, should be funny. Unfortunately, this movie misses the mark and never becomes the comic force that it should be. Hanks does not inspire many chuckles for his portrayal of a silver-tongued crook and his henchmen are foul-mouthed, hugely sterotypical, and not particularly funny. The only thing that earns this movie any stars at all is the portrayal of the church-going landlady by Irma P. Hall and the gospel music in the background and the church scenes. This movie goes to show that just because it stars Tom Hanks, it's not necessarily a good movie."
1,I'D RATHER WATCH RON POPEIL'S INFOMERCIAL ON HIS NEW DONKEY GENITAL SHAVER.,"Dear Lord above, I call on you to please return to me the 9 minutes of my life I wasted watching this horrible movie. Tom Hanks is a pretty good actor but in this film I'd have to say his acting was about as good as a retarded old man trying to play the title role in ""The life of marilyn Monroe"". The language used in this film is horrendous to say the least. Every other word was the ""F"" word and in some films it fits. But in this film it fit about as good as the elephant man in a motorcycle helmet. I wish I could only give it 1 star but what the heck, I guess the key grip deserves it.I kneel before you oh heavenly father and pray you'll give me back this wasted time......."
1,a Tax Write Off film for Tom Hanks,I gotta Believe that Tom Hanks did this Film for a Tax Credit because I can't belief in Good faith he would agree to be in this Mess of a Film.it ain't funny at all&nothing works at all.I had to turn this mess off.
1,Tom Hanks Worst movie and Not Funny,"We didn't even bother to finish watching this movie, it was that bad. Probably Tom Hanks worst. Definitely not for family viewing as the language was as filthy as it could be. And not funny either."
1,The Dude Has Left The Building......,"I dont beleive artists who are consistently releasing good pieces should be written off or dismissed when they make a couple of stinkers.The Coens are no exception and nor does this analogy excuse their last two films.LadyKillers is bland,boring and banal.All I have to say is that their next movie better be gold wrapped in silk cause they are dangerously close to losing their crown of odd and more importantly audience attendance on every level."
1,Tom Hanks Owes Me $16.50,"Two friends and I went to see The Ladykillers while travelling through Florida. It was my turn to treat. We walked out after giving it a generous one-hour viewing. The only redeeming quality was that the popcorn was tasty. Why didn't his wife, Rita Wilson, who was responsible for getting My Big Fat Greek Wedding to the big screen, slap him across the face and say ""Snap out of it.""? Woe are we who tried to see, The Ladykillers, and ended up disappointees."
2,"Oh Brothers, Where Are You??","A mildly enjoyable comedy/gangster movie, ""The Ladykillers"" tells the story of five frustrated criminals who pretend to be musicians in order to foul an old lady and use her house as the HQ for a big steal. Despite some funny moments at parts, this movie is too uneven, predictable and flawed to truly recommend. Ok, so Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall are good on their roles, there are a couple of black humour scenes with neat dialogue and the directing is competent, yet the overall result is still forgettable and a bit disposable. Not really a bad flick, but not a particularly convincing one either. Good to watch once as it presents some entertainment value, even if the Coen brothers have done much better in the past.Decent, yet too average to impress and surprise."
2,"Almost, but not quite.",As a fan of the Coen brothers I was very disappointed by this film because it was almost good. The snappy and perfectly timed dialogue they usually have never quite materializes here. The wonderful characters you would expect to find here are mostly hollow and not quite original or sharp. Add to this the fact that the original is a classic and in no way needed to be remade and it's a swing and a miss.This movie seems less like a Coen brothers movie than it does a movie made by fans of theirs that were stealing from them in uninspired ways.
3,And Then There Were None...,"The Ladykillers was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Tom Hanks among others.The acting is pretty good, the humor is average, and the plot is below average.Some of the characters were very good like the casino's janitor (Wayans), the ""explosives expert"" (Pancake) and the General, but the ""dumb"" guy (Lump) and Mountain Girl were just ridiculous. To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that many of the actors were given, including Tom Hanks.Nevertheless, Irma P. Hall is GREAT in her role as the ""good old lady.""Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.A shame really...In a nutshell, it's an okay movie, and that's about it; No masterpiece here..."
2,Very Disappointing...,"I'd have to say that this is the first Tom Hanks film I found to be disappointing. In fact, I didn't even watch half of it. Hanks, as usual, does a good job on the acting of his character (for what I saw), but what I couldn't get past was the massive amount of swearing in the film. I was totally unprepared for it when I sat down in front of the TV.For those who want a family comedy, this isn't it. I would have given it 1 star, but Hanks' acting brings it up...a little."
2,Slight Coen,"A film re-make of a classic has a hard way to go, and this one does not make it. Surprisingly it is Hanks who is the weak link. His weak and unconvincing role in this film dooms it to second class status. See the original!This may well be the least of the Coen Brother's films."
4,Hilariously vulgar,"I finished viewing this movie moments ago. I started watching it merely for a laugh, not even knowing it was a Coen brothers film. If I had that previous knowledge, I may have hesitated a bit. FARGO was one of the best movies I have ever seen, however some of their other collaborations aren't as enlightening to me. THE LADYKILLERS, a quasi-remake of the 1950's comedy, brought me revived respect for the brothers as filmmakers. At first I was thrown off by the profanity, only because it was getting excessive and was very unexpected. (Not that frequent profanities bother me really; some of my favorite films are Scorcese and Tarantino productions.) I will not hesitate to buy this as soon as the DVD is released. The Coen brothers spared no expense when it came to precise dialogue and offbeat humor. I can say that I had a feeling where the money was going to end up, but other than that, nothing was even remotely clicheed or obvious."
3,Well I thought it was funny...,"It's not classic Coen brothers in the same way that Hudsucker or Raising Arizona were, but it is hilarious. Most of the reviewers here seem put off by either a) Hanks' accent or b) Wayans' swearing and I just have to say... get over it! You're watching character pieces and how they interact with each other is very, very funny.Overall I'd rank the Coen Brothers movies (that I've seen) thusly... you can make up your own mind if you've seen more than a few of these...1) Hudsucker Proxy2) Raising Arizona3) Barton Fink4) O Brother Where Art Thou?5) Ladykillers6) Fargo7) Miller's Crossing8) Blood Simple9) Big Lewbowski(I haven't seen Intolerable Cruelty or Crimewave)"
4,We must have waffles forthwith,"Who are these people that couldn't hear the 'curse words' or were 'bored to tears?'. If you're looking for a funny, quirky movie, this is a great one. I'm a huge Coen bros. fan, and I enjoyed this movie."
2,SAD REMAKE OF A FUNNY FILM,"Tom Hanks, a most appealing actor, is locked into a most boring role. His verbal acrobatics as a Southern Gentleman seemed endless, even though no longer than a few sentences at times, The other Ladykillers, his fellow criminal conspirators, although intended to be comic stereotypes, mostly fell on their faces in sad pursuit of a laugh, the lady of the Ladykillers failed ever to evoke the necessary sympathy, being so clearly never in danger and so (deliberately) drawn as a caricature of Aunt Jemima. All in all, it was a sadly unfunny waste of talent.For those who do not find street-language or the use of racial epithets and caricatures acceptable, it is well to repeat the warning: most of the comedy is built on these twin pillars.My suggestion: download or go out and rent, the original minor classic, the British Alec Guinness film."
1,BIG disappointment,"Very disappointing - escpecially for a Tom Hanks movie.Had trouble getting past the fact they every other word was #$%@$@$&%*&On top of the the plot was plotless, the story was storyless.They should have just dumped everyone into the garbage barges at the beginning of the movie and called it finished."
2,So disappointing,"I expected this movie to display the same sense of humor as ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", but I was sorely disappointed. There are some funny moments, but Marlon Wayans' unnecessary profranity is so jarring, it disrupts the comedy before it can get started. The best scenes are the dialog-free establishing shots where you'll enjoy the excellent cinematography characteristic of the Coen brothers movies. Second best is Irma P Hall's performance. She's wonderful, especially in her solo scenes or those talking to the sheriff. You really wish the Coen's had thrown away the script, fired all of the ""ladykillers"" and just rewritten the movie around Irma and the Mississippi setting."
2,"Skip the ""Ladykillers""","Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actors especially after watching and appreciating some of his films like Gump,Road to Perdition and Cast Away.It's not often the man does a sub-par role.In the movie Ladykillers,he plays his role earnestly with elegance and reassurance. The movie however is disappointing.I felt all actors played their role adequately.It's just a little too mixed culture for me.The storyline is rather limited.It's like a dramatic comedy with a few laughs and lot of church. I didn't know what to expect.I heard someone say it's funny.I'm sorry cause this will go down as the one Tom Hanks film I don't recommend to anyone.Anyhow,watch this movie only if you're as stubborn as me and must see every movie by Mr.Hanks."
2,Waste of Tom Hanks' talent.,"This remake of a classic film was disappointing at best. The story as portrayed was inplausible and the character played by Tom Hanks was an absolute waste of his talent. The only somewhat bright spot was Irma Hall, who was by far the most entertaining member of the cast."
1,"Why Mr. Wayans, Why?","The Coen Brothers made O Brother Where Art Thou. Which was excellent! Lady Killers would have been nice if they had cut Marlon Wayans. He curse too much, and didn't make sense during the scheme of the movie. I don't know if any other black actor would have made that role better, but the whole movie just didn't do it for me. I didn't watch the movie all the way through. It had too much profanity, and it didn't make sense. This movie was a total bomb."
1,WACK,"In the words of my daughter ""this movie is wack"". It is not at all what I expected from Tom Hanks and it was quite boring. If I could rate according to my opinion, it would be a zero. I do regret purchasing the movie before I had read the reviews of a normal viewing audience, vice Hollywood."
3,A hearty laugh for Hanks,"Years ago when this movie was released in theaters I went with my friend Cindy and we laughed ourselves silly. There's nothing worse than a movie billed as being hilarious and you hardly crack a smile -- Lady Killers more than delivered. When I ordered my own copy I was wondering if I would still find it funny. Yes! Tom Hanks is such a versatile actor and his supporting cast equally talented, not to mention the amazing Cohen brothers who dreamed this all up."
4,Tom Hanks Has Never Been Funnier!,"The Ladykillers is a smart film with a hilarious performance by Tom Hanks! The film itself is pretty funny! The film may be uneven at times, but it is still enjoyable! An Enjoyable Film!"
2,Not what I expected,"My goodness, what a strange movie! Oddball Professor Dorr (Hanks) and his ""band"" of thieves invade the home of a devoutly religious widow (played very well by Irma P. Hall) in order to pull off a far-fetched casino heist. The characters are colorful and diverse in their personalities, giving the movie a pretty offbeat feel. I have to admit I did not see the original 1955 version and was just expecting a good ol' fashioned fun slapstick comedy. There are slapstick elements to some of the scenes, but I would definitely classify this as more on the ""dark comedy"" side.Unfortunately, many of the so-called humorous moments with the gang of thieves fell flat for me, and the non-stop profanity from one of the characters got old fast. Aside from some amusing moments with the widow or her cat, I'm afraid I just didn't enjoy the movie."
3,"Terrible swearing, but not bad movie","This is quite a funny movie, especially along the lines of O Brother Where Art Thou. It would be great family entertainment if there was not so much swearing involved. Swearing is outdated and unuseful in films and this is no exception."
3,It has its moments.,"The Ladykillers is self-indulgent, self-conscious, and bland. So, you might ask, why did I give it three stars? Well, let's just say it barely made three because of some nice acting, Tom Hanks in particular, and a number of mildly amusing moments. Some of it is visually stunning, too, like the island of trash that looks like an hallucinatory hell in some dreamlike sea. But the camera lingers unnaturally on all manner of objects and sets, as if guided by a film school student who hasn't yet learned that you can only watch a dripping faucet for so long.I wouldn't go out of my way to see this movie. I guess I'm glad I did, and the rating of three is a bit out respect for directors I admired, only a little less so now."
2,It's just not that funny,"This just isn't in the same league as ""O Brother"" or ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" Most of the acting was pretty good, particularly the performances by Irma Hall and Tom Hanks. However, there's not much anyone could have done with the ""Lump"" or ""Garth Pancake"" characters. The story just wasn't ""heist"" enough for a heist film, and sure as heck wasn't funny enough for a comedy. Uh, who decided that Irritable Bowel Syndrome was funny? Oh no, I might have spoiled the movie by mentioning ""IBS"" . . . but if that's a spoiler, then that alone tells you what type of movie you're in for.One last comment: bear in mind that I was one of the few people who actually LIKED Intolerable Cruelty, and still I wasn't impressed with this movie.My advice : wait for the DVD release or at least catch the matinee showing."
1,Who's watching this?,"The audience for the 1955 Ealing Studios film of the same name must be just a few sentimental cinephiles like yours truly. A remake, therefore, has to do something to help the story march with the times, if it is to be a profitable product in a shabby age. This film, however - the second Coen Bros turkey in a row - exhibits some of the worst qualities of the cinematic art in our time: a self-referential irony that constantly rips the narrative fabric to shreds; overdrawn characters who are more like cartoons than like people; a smug and self-congratulatory visual slickness; and a relentless tendency to suppose that tiresome repetition of the ""f"" word represents something like humor, when it just doesn't fit into this tale at all. What happened to the Coens who made ""Fargo""? What a sorry sell-out."
4,A PRETTY FUNNY MOVIE!,"""The Ladykillers"" is another fine comedy film from the Coen brothers (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). Tom Hanks is once again at his comedic best as G.H. Dorr, and is supported by a fine cast (Including Irma P. Hall, J.K. Simmons, and Ryan Hurst). The only problem I have with the film is Marlon Wayans, who is one of the most annoying actors in Hollywood. His comedy is never funny, and his acting is never good. However, the rest of the cast, the many comedic moments, and the great gospel music make up for a lot. Fans of the Coens Brothers, and of good comedies, will surely enjoy it.Movie/DVD Grade: B+"
1,This Ladykiller is a Loser!,"I cannot fathom what Tom Hanks was doing in this picture other than to get it released into theatres instead of going straight to the video shelves. I was barely ten minutes into the movie when the trashy profanity started; inundated with uses of M-F'r, G-d-mn, N-gg-r, p---sy, and other assorted insults. I suppose I could get by all that if the movie was interesting or worthwhile in any respect. But this picture suffers from a terminal case of boredom, and aside from a few good opening moments, it's worthless. I wanted to see this Cohen Brothers movie after the tremendous success of ""Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?"" but this rendering of The Ladykillers isn't just a waste of time and money, it's just really, really badly done poor taste."
2,No real punch,This remake is not even close to the original. It's long and not that funny. Even Hank's southern twang isnt that good. Stick with Guiness's original and watch a good Coen Bros' movie.
4,See it,"You just have to see the movie and judge for yourself. Away for seminars I found myself trapped in my hotel room, and The Ladykillers was available so I figured, why not? Turned out to be a fantastic time, and there is one scene in the film that still cracks me up for a few minutes each time I think about it (hint: hammer). Hanks shows again that he is a fantastic actor. I admit I never saw the original, though, so I have not been affected as other reviewers who seem to favor the earlier ""classic."" If you haven't seen the older one, chances are you will greatly enjoy this film. Just prepare yourself for a fun time when you pop it in the ol' dvd player. I'm looking forward to renting it so I can enjoy again, but with the wife."
3,forgot the foul language it has,"It is a funny movie plot but the language is offensive to me. I had forgotten that when my husband ordered it. I'm sure it was in the product description but he ordered it quickly on a whim, so our fault."
4,Very entertaining,"The Coen Brothers certainly did it again. The entire audience thoroughly enjoyed this movie and clapped when it was done. Lots of laughs and very well cast. Didn't expect it to be so funny, so I was pleasantly surprised."
5,Ladykillers... or are they?,"Hilarious! Perhaps those who hated this movie can be forgiven since they probably don't know anything about the Coen Brothers and their unique genius. Perhaps you don't appreciate the great and funny performances especially by Marlon Wayans and Tom Hanks. Perhaps you don't realize that a great actor like Tom Hanks may want to stretch and play different characters. Perhaps you know nothing about movies!But then again, I'm glad you hated it, because if everyone loved the Coen Brothers as I do, and if they were rich moguls whose every movie was a huge mega-hit, perhaps they wouldn't continue to turn out quirky gems such as this, and perhaps I'd be the miserable one, instead of all you jamokes complaining about a funny and rare film such as this."
2,Why the language?,"This was almost a good movie. Most of the actors did a good job, with the exception of Wayans. Unfortunately, it seems that all Wayans can do is swear. In a movie that had some excellent acting, fun quirky characters, Wayans makes the movie un-enjoyable to watch. Take the profanity out, and it could be worth watching again."
2,Not their best film.,"I do loved most of the films that the Coen Brother have made but this is just a huge mess from the get go. Tom Hanks does well but other than him, this is just not as good as it should have been. They should have just had a very good rewrite before they started to film because as the film is now, its a huge blunder."
5,Another Coen Brothers Classic!,Great cast! It's too bad this movie has been overlooked. The story is hilarious and Tom Hanks and Marlon Wayans are fantastic.
2,A Little Disillusioned...,"I went to see ""Ladykillers"" this weekend, hoping to have a good laugh with one of my favorite comedic actors, Tom Hanks, and to enjoy the silliness of Marlon Wayans. I was concerned after hearing the ""N"" word several times during the beginning of the movie from the African-American female star. Also, Marlon Wayans addressed everyone he met with ""What's Up, (...)."" There is a lot of unnecessary profanity in this movie, so it would not be suitable for youth. That aside, there are a FEW funny moments: the painting of ""Otha,"" the deceased husband of the female star, whose painted expression changes at different times in the movie, and ""Pickles"" the cat, a talented animal actor who ends up carrying off the severed finger of one of the criminals. Marlon Wayan's character is stereotypically the first to die in this romp... Take my advice and save a few dollars -- this is definitely a movie you can wait to see in video."
1,I can't believe Tom Hanks would even consider this!!,"Being an admirer of Tom Hanks' capabilities, I was totally caught off guard with this film. The profanity is unnecessary and almost embarrassing. It may be based on an old comedy, but by today's standards it seems ridiculous and just plain dumb. I had to quickly check out other people's reviews because I truly felt this movie was terrible. I thought it might just be me!"
1,THE MOVIEKILLERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,One of Tom Hanks Worst Film Ever Made In the U.S.A.This movie waSn'T Even funny at all I mean At all.Dnt even think about buyin this movie or rentin it cause it is the worst movie I ever Watched in my yrs.If you're bored dont even watch it. Its that bad I tell you all.If I can I would give it a 0 star movie.This movie had bad acting and why the hell is Tom Hanks in this movie. Shouldn't he be in little (G) rated movies. I was suprised he was in this (r) rated movie. Tom HAnks doesn't deserve to be in (r) rated movies or this sucky movie> Tom is like a thug in this movie. He is white not Black. So I g2g and remember dnt even get this movie. Tom Hanks sucked d*** in this non classis movie. It won't even hit TV LAND.
5,Fantastic,"With our first child we read all the Sears books except this one. I didn't discover it at B&N. Now, with our second we're delighted to see the context of attachment parenting through the lense of our faith. I highly regard this book as a treasure for parenting."
3,Any suggestions?,"Hello, can anyone please let me know if I should also buy the Portable Pediatrician along with this book or are the two books similar regarding medical care? Suggestions/comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
2,Not what I expected,"I am a big fan of the Sears' books and am feeling a bit guilty for giving this book a low rating! I own The Baby Book and The Breastfeeding Book and cannot write enough good things about both publications.I purchased this book recently and was disappointed. I was hoping for a book that would help guide my husband and I in raising our son in a Christian manner. However, the majority of this book is dedicated to pregnancy and childbirth. Since my son is already 5 months old, I didn't really need this information. Very little of the book is dedicated to infancy, toddlerhood and the issues that come about during these stages.The book is well written, but much of the information regarding nutrition, health, discipline, as well as many other questions/concerns/issues is better covered in The Baby Book."
1,Damaging to Family Unit,"I bought this book thinking it would be a good health manual with a christian perspective but I was very disappointed.From a christian perspective, I found it shocking that it took several scriptures out of context in developing their permissive-parenting philosophies. Young babies are to be centre of the family (and marriage), rather than equal members. No helping babies to develope in the way they should go. I think this book could be damaging to the core unit called ""family"" if fully embraced.Try a more balanced parenting style (not the extremes of demand or schedule feeding) like that which is found in ""Secrets of the baby Whisperer"" or ""Babywise 1""."
1,MERCHANDISE NOT ARRIVED,"As far as today (30/4/2011) , I have not yet received the merchandise bought from you on 28/3/2011 (Strivectin-SD three items). Please review my order and inform me by mail.RegardsJaime Soto"
1,compression socks,"These are so tight and painful around the toes I couldn't wear them for more than a couple of hours. I would recommend the open toe socks, not the closed toe!"
2,Can't recommend it.,"Warning: animals and humans are tortured in this book. But that's not why I rated it ""poor."" It's because I figured out, almost from the beginning, who was behind it all and after that, I really didn't care. There were red herrings trying to divert suspicion, chapters that took you into the killer's mind, a massive government conspiracy, a romance for the protagonist, and I still didn't care. In fact, I ended up skimming through most of the book. I've enjoyed other books by Hecht, but just can't recommend this one."
3,"Interesting read, but not his best.","Daniel Hecht has two other books I thoroughly enjoyed. I am speaking of the Cree Black thrillers, ""City of Masks"" and ""Land of Echos."" He has one other book with Mo Ford in it, ""Skull Session."" This book really confused me because I recalled that at the end of the book,SPOILER HEREMo Ford was killed off. So how'd he resurrect his for this book?Anyway, the story is pretty interesting, a serial killer hanging his victims up with string, a la puppets. It really didn't take a great deal of ingenuity to figure out who the killer was, I think Hecht wanted you to know but the chase to catch him is the thrill. Overall, a pretty good read."
3,"New Introduction, please","This was more amusing that I expected. I hadn't read much of ""Li'l Abner"" and was surprised. However, I have two objections to this book. First, the original strips seem a bit truncated. Surely, they could have gotten more of the dailies in this book than they did. And second, the awful introduction by Harlan Ellison. He seems to be in love with the sound of his voice and not necessarily a Li'l Abner fan. The Schmoo seems to have been a craze like the ""Pet Rock."" More information about that and less about Ellison's advertures in New York City would have been welcomed."
5,"Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?","Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.Laid eggs...gave milk......and died of sheer ecstasy when looked at with hunger.It could taste like any food you desire.Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.Even Shmoo whiskers made excellent toothpicks.In essence, the Shmoo supplied all of the world's wants.I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant to you and why you were brought here.I'm sorry, who are you?I'm The Boss."
3,Lively and fun.,"Not as ""Hollywood"" as the video release of the Doris Day classic, but a fine stage representation. More songs included here than in the movie version, and many of the same performers. A lively cast with many fun and memorable songs."
5,Vivid Characters and descriptive locations,"From the opening dialogue sequence, I knew I had in my hands a book that would capture my attention and capture my attention it did. I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Mandy's journey from child to woman was both painful and believable. Every last character sprang vividly into my imagination as did the descriptive locations. I'm looking forward to Laura Catherine Brown's next book."
4,Enveloping,"I haven't seen this novel on bookshelves, but it is extremely well done and deserves some readership. It touches lightly on the mother/daughter genre/cliche, but explores the relationship in such harrowing, disturbing and emotional ways that it doesn't seem like something that has been done before. Expect to want to read this in a day - don't expect to feel ""uplifted"" as Douglas Glover writes in a review on the back of the hardcover edition . . . I found myself rather depressed, but it made me think - about my own previous relationships, about the difficulty in grasping who people are, and who you are, when you are caught up in the first waves of love."
4,Quickening=A Quick Read,"A very compelling tale of the pain of growing up with (very) imperfect parents. I was absorbed and could feel the main character's pain even as I wanted to warn her to avoid it. Well drawn characters and a wonderful ""journey through time"" as Miranda learns major life lessons."
1,A Lousy Read,"""Quickening"" intends to be a moving account of a young girl's journey of self discovery, but instead I found myself marveling at how unsympathetic the main character was. Mandy is a dull, unattractive, easily-influenced, self-pitying dishrag. She mopes, she wallows, she has sex with anyone with a pulse and then wonders why it doesn't work out. To keep her company, the author has conjured up a group of equally abnoxious characters, including an obese, hypochondriac mother to a ""Praise Jay-sus"" country preacher. They're all red-neck grotesques, and though fans of Ms. Brown will most likely claim that they're ""taken from real life,"" I suspect that they've been plucked from repeated viewings of Jerry Springer and ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" The last chapter is by far the best, but by then it's much too late to redeem this condescending, stagnant, and frequently scatalogical read."
3,Good while it lasted,It has a lot of great tone. A nice fat low end and the aluminum brings the brights out.However it made it about 18 months before one of the cones blew. Came with a 12 month warranty so that wasn't very helpful. Pulled out the bad cone to get rid of the distortion and about 6 months later another cone blew. A 4x10 with two cones is pretty useless and they cost so much to replace it is really worthless now.
4,"Good product, and the price is better","I bought this for my husband, and so far, it has worked great. My husband has not had any problems with it, and after a year, still works great."
3,Ok,Thought the housing was steel but it is plastic..... My son is happy so I am happy... Zebco reels R the best in their price range...
4,OK solid reel,"I purchased this reel and used it several times this summer for mostly bobber and sunny fishing. It is overkill for this, but was the right price. I changed out the very thick line for some 6lb Trilene. At first I had issues and then realized it required more line on the spool (nearly full as Zebco instructs). This made the difference and become a solid reel - preferring it over the cheap Zebco 202 by quite a bit. Certainly, there are nicer reels out there you'd want for bass fishing; but for a low end spincast, bober/sunny fishing - this one will work (consider changing the line out though)."
4,Great jazz from an unknown artist,"It's a shame that this woman is virutally unknown...she's a stellar jazz trumpet player and this is a great album. Rebecca Coupe Franks is joined by an excellent band, including legendary sax player Joe Henderson, for a fun, funky, jazzy combination of standards and originals. I first heard of her when I received a free Justice Records sampler. I've only heard one song on her other album, ""All of a Sudden,"" and I loved that as well.Take advantage of the fact that this disc is dirt cheap. If you're a jazz fan, you'll probably love this."
4,Short But Sweet,"Short but sweet. Just four songs but the version of 'I'm A Man' with Jimmy Page bowing his guitar makes it worth the price.Songs are: Shapes Of Things, Happenings Ten Years Time Ago, Over Under Sideways Down and I'm A Man.The Yardbirds are: Jimmy Page, Keith Relf, Jim McCarty and Chris Dreja.German TV-1967"
4,Mixed Emotions,"I feel compelled to give this hypnotic read a high rating alone for its fresh premise. Mr. Lehane does an excellent job weaving many characters into the story with an astounding clarity of individual personalities (many authors creating this many characters would have had us in a state of confusion, but he pulls it off beautifully). The book has one of the best twists to be written in a long period of time. Potential readers will either love or hate the streamlined and simple dialogue. The only thing that prevents me from giving the book 5 stars is that, in my opinion, the book fizzles out on the last 40 or so pages (maybe I just feel this way due to the fact that I guessed the ending). However, this book moves right along, without any sluggishness, so if you are a suspense fan, do not miss this one."
3,"Superbly suspenseful, but ultimately a let down","This book sweeps you along, with marvelous twists and turns, however, it ultimately becomes a disappointment, the ending is not well thought through and is a terrible let down to what appeared to be a powerhouse of a book."
5,Great book,"I watched the movie first and I really enjoyed it but the book went into all the detail that the movie left out. This book was great and it made the story real and linked everything together, which the movie didn't.... Great read....."
4,mystic river,the book jumped around a little to much in the beginning it was hard to keep the characters straight after that book as good
5,Spellbinding!,"I bought this because I enjoyed the movie; but the book surpasses that.A mesmerizing, engrossing read, with a twist at the end that completelysurprised me! It was also my first Kindle purchase and I'm thoroughlyhooked."
3,better than I thought it would be a little hard to get into at first,if its a true story it sure was gruesome A little hard to into a first but once your in its good reading
3,Nothing special about Mystic River,"I'd previously heard of the movie Mystic River, but never watched it. Books are supposed to be better than their movies, right? If that's the case, I'd hate to see the movie version of Mystic River. Since the movie had a cast of legendary actors, I made the assumption that the book would blow me away.It didn't.In fact, it took me almost 3 months to get through the entire book. The storyline has the potential to be great, but it took FOREVER to really get the storyline moving. My biggest complaint about this book was that I felt that many of the details of the story were unnecessary and used simply to fill pages.I was not expecting the ending, so from that perspective, it was shocking and kept me interested. But then again, that was the ending. The beginning and middle of the book were slow going and drab. If you're a reader who is looking to be captivated, I would not recommend Mystic River."
5,Even Better than the Movie,"When I started this book, I didn't think I'd enjoy it since I'd already seen the movie. Boy, was I wrong! Dennis Lehane's mystery is very psychological drama and goes far deeper into the characters than the movie could. I was amazed by Lehane's ability to dig into the minds of his characters, and his ability to write interior dialog. Mystic River is a taught, compelling thriller, and I can't wait to read more of his books."
5,suspenceful,"I had a hard time putting the book down. The charactors are fascinating,enough mystery to keep you on the edge of your seat. As I read, it feels like I am there. I would recommend the book to anyone."
3,The Movie Was Better,"I read the book to see how much it resembled the movie. It was pretty much the same. Maybe the movie spoiled it for me. After all, the book did not feature Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon or Tim Robbins."
4,Great read.,Could have been a 5 star rating if the language wasn't so offensive. It was well written and held my attention throughout the book.
5,Great Book,"I havent read a crime/mystery in a long time, but this was a great introduction back into the genre. The language is gritty yet eloquent, & the plot is suspenseful enough to keep me reading throughout every available minute."
5,Wonderful,"This book was so intense and it was so tragic all at the same time. I cared about all the characters and could understand their emotions well. This is my second Dennis Lehane book (Shutter Island was first) and I have to say, both of his books I've read were absolutely perfect. He doesn't waste tons of pages on useless words - he can say something so powerful in few words - and that is something I appreciate. I hate to read long winded descriptions of mundane things - and Lehane is most certainly not verbose. Wonderful book - I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed. I listened to this book in audio book format, and the reader was absolutely brilliant!"
5,On my Top List,"Although I first read this book several years ago, I recently read it again. Despite the passing of 6 years, Mystic River still remains on the top of my list of favorite fiction. A heartbreaking tale, it's almost common place in real life sends a message to parents, children, and friends alike. In the blink of an eye a life can change and Lehane brings this point across time and time again in his portraying of the ties that bind. A true classic in the genre of modern day crime."
3,"the good , the bad and the beautiful","The boy who got in the car seems to be the theme of the novel.Three boys grow up into men of very different typesand meet again due to a horrible murder of the bad one's beautiful daughter.At the very start of this novel a comment about the boys developing a hate for chocolate candy due to their father's jobs rang false to me.There is an amoral type slant to this novelthat bothers me.There is the systematic assumption that the ""broken"" boy can't be fixed and will be a problem always ...I think maybe that just accepting that assumption has flawed this novel?"
2,"Tedious, unrealistic prose","I could have liked the book if the prose wasn't so overdrawn. The characters are blue collar but the prose doesn't fit.For example, Jimmy is sitting alone on his front porch of his three decker the night his daughter was found murdered. The night was quiet. This is the way Lehane draws Jimmy's perception of the night: ""The noise that normally ruled the daytime wasn't gone, it was merely sucked up, as if into a pair of lungs, and then held, waiting to be expelled. He trusted that hush, warmed to it, because it promised the return of the noise, even as it held it captive. Jimmy couldn't imagine living somewhere rural,...""Does this fit the character and the situation? It just gets in the way at best or undermines the reality of the character at worst.As a result, the characters weren't real to me. When that happens it's hard to get involved with the book. I ended up skimming most of it.If the movie removes this pretentiousness, it could be much better than the book."
1,let down,"I heard that Clint Eastwood wanted to do this movie so I immediately read the book. The plot started out great but the end was awful! I can't imagine the movie could make it end up any better, unless they completely go away from the book. Save your money!"
1,What A Joke!!,"What's wrong with all you Amazon reviewers?I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.Avoid!"
4,A Great New Novel,"It's not Kenzie and Gennarro, but it's still a great read! Lehane's sense of place is phenomonal (sp?), and his way with words and description make this a quick read. There is a lot of pain in this novel and it's more ""literary"" than the earlier novels, this is a broad scoped novel about friendship, death and love. The solution is a bit predictable, but it's still a great read and should be the novel that puts Lehane over the top and on to the bestseller lists."
2,A Sad dissappointment,"Prior to this book, Lehane was my favorite author, ""Darkness, Take my hand"" being my particular favorite. This book, however, felt incredibly forced and was, I'm sorry to say, totally predictable. I understand that the loss of someone you love is incredibly tough, but he milks that pain like you wouldn't believe. It was describes so much that the reader (or at least I), become numb to it. I'm sad to see such a great writer become so bogged down.As an interesting note, I've heard that Lehane's publisher likes this new kind of ""stand-alone"" novel and asked him what it would take to write more like it. So it appears we may not see Patrick Kenzie (his character from previous books) for a while (or, god forbid, ever). Here's hoping his next effort is better."
3,"so much steam going into it, but fizzled in the end","The first two-thirds of this book were compelling and well written - although I think most of the dialogue was trite and weak throughout. Once the identity of who is responsible for Katie's murder the book colapses into a sappy, unbelievable ending with even more lousy dialogue. It could have been great, but it seems the author lost his focus and just wanted to end it. I will see the movie and see if the dialogue is silly or if they spiced it up some for the big screen."
2,Predictable,"In January I saw Dennis Lehane speak at a trade show. He was such a wonderful speaker that I was compelled to stand in line to get my signed copy of Mystic River. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The first half of the book was engrossing and somewhat suspenseful, but once I got to page 264 I figured out the whole entire ending. After that everything was predictable."
1,The 1st story,"I have only gotten threw the first story and will not continue to read this. the plot line is negative and of a black nature. The start of the 2nd story carries the same rotten children to adult hood which I see no point in continuing to read about thier go nowhere, do nothing lives."
4,too long,"this author definitely has talent; his writing is exceptional; only problem with this particular book is that it is too long; in my opinion, about 100 pages could have been taken out of this and the story would have been just as good."
2,His worst book,"First time I tried this book it turned me off Lehane. Fortunately I ran across some of his other work later. I recently tried again and same reaction. Rambling, repetitive, etc. Like listening to a drunk telling a long story meandering story. Try Shutter Island or some other of his work."
5,"Not a mystery, really, but something better","This is by far Lehane's best book. It is a textbook example of a character driven story; even minor characters are fleshed out better than the protagonist of a John Grisham novel.One thing that should be said is that ""Mystic River"" is much more of a ""moral dilemma"" book than a straight out mystery, which is good, because I figured it out about half way through. If you're looking for a whodunnit, you may be better off looking elsewhere. But if you want character development, excellent writing that keeps you involved and just a ... great story told without a false note in 400 pages, this is the one."
2,"Literary in Depth, Dissatisfying in Content","Few novels of recent authorship have really been intended to linger in the reader's mind beyond the closing words -- which was why this story of such amazing emotional depth and maturity was as pleasantly surprising as it was to me. When nearing the finish, I honestly believed I was reading something deep and interesting, dramatic when the plot required it.Sixty or so pages from the end, however, it collapses on itself with all the weight of its own empathetic spirit. The story lapses into typing up the murder's mystery -- doing so in a rather shoddy manner that makes me wonder if Mr. LeHane didn't come upon his deadline in the midst of writer's block and hire an amateur noir novelist to finish it for him.In the end, the unneccesary details of the end feel poorly crafted and lazily drawn, the broad and introspective scope of the previous chapters moot. It's still worthy of a read, but don't expect an ending as dazzling as its brilliant lead-up."
4,Engrossing,"This was the first Lehane novel I've ever read, and overall I was not disappointed. His characters literally seem to be sitting next to you - his talent for bringing them to life is truly astounding.I was enthralled by the intriguing, complex way Lehane weaved the three estranged friends and the people they touched together.I would've given this book five stars if it weren't for the ending and the outcome. Without saying too much, I felt cheated."
4,Lehane- Master of stunning character!!,"Mystic River is a dark novel that revolves around the lives of three young boys who are unlikely friends. Their lives begin to grow apart following the abduction of one of the boys.As adults, their lives have all taken very different paths, but their paths recross after a tragic murder draws them together in a spiraling whirlwind of heartbreaking sorrow.Dennis Lehane is a master of great characters, each one so clearly defined and so real. The writing draws you into the very disparate lives of these unique, dark men, into their homes, their thoughts, their fears and their loves. The book holds your attention, even when you want to put it down! The ending is stunning, not because it is not something you anticipated, but because of the deft way that Lehane crafts it and finely tunes it."
3,"Slow start, but picks up steam.","This was a good book, but I wish I would have skipped the first four chapters. Slow starter. Have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Lehane's writing style. Would have preferred reading the screenplay. Good story line and is worth the read."
2,Stopped reading this book.,Not worth the read. I started it and stopped quickly into it. If a book does not grab me and hold me into the first 100 pages i stop it. I stopped this one.
2,Really?...,"Wow. Book was as predictable as it gets. Really? People loved this?...I will try the movie sometime, hope its better.Plus the digs at western Mass did not help considering we in Western Mass are not to fond of Bostonians."
3,"Good plot, too much psychology","The plot is interesting but the too frequent excursion into the momentary internal goings-on in the characters gets a little much. I tiered of descriptions of visceral reactions and emotional states. At time I wanted to skip over and get to the actions and decisions. I remained with the story however, which says something."
4,lehane at his best,"As a die-hard Dennis Lehane fan, this is a must read. Doesn't rely on the quick repartee of the Kenzie-Genaro series, but is just as gritty and streetwise as you would expect. Great prose and storytelling and a plot full of twists and turns. Looking forward to his new novel."
4,Better Than the Movie,"Read the book years after seeing the movie. Enjoyed the descriptions of the key characters and their human frailties. Good, fast read."
1,terrible language,"actually ended up throwing the book away. the more I read, the worse the language got. I suggest you give readers a clue if the book contains bad language"
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Too much detail for my reading enjoyment. Good storyline, just too much other stuff for my liking. Possibly better for male readers."
2,Mystic river,Read 27% before I gave up. Too depressing for me. Well written but did not keep my interest. Even the murder was unexciting for me. I don't want to read about people who hate their lives and that is what I read.
2,I must have missed something,"I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character."
3,Good start but lost it in the ending,"I am a great fan of Dennis Lehane, with ""Gone Baby Gone"" one of my all time favorites. I was, therefore, looking forward to the release of this book. I can say that I'm a little disappointed, though. The beginning was good and the plot and characters were developing nicely. Once I got into it I found myself engrossed. Then, all of a sudden, it ended and there was no real explanation of why the guilty acted as they did. I could have given motive - in fact I guessed the ""whodunit"" long before I got there - but only the barest of motive was given by the author. It felt empty - all that build up and then, oh well, that's why the crime was committed. Maybe that was the idea by Mr. Lehane, to show that no big motives are necessary to commit such a heinous crime but I didn't connect that at all."
3,"As mystery goes, it's a 3, but . . .","I know I may be going against a lot of other A+ reviews here.I'm definitely a Dennis Lehane fan. But as Mystic River goes, Dennis is struggling to tell a mystery or writing a literature. I read Lahane for his story telling in mystery and the wise cracks of Kenzie and the dark romance with Angie. For me, he spent way too much time in the characters and the mood of thing, and I was lost in the story. Maybe it's me, but reading 5-8 pages to get to a point is way too much for me. I'd forgotten what I was trying to know.But, I'm pretty sure, if I re-read the book as a literature, I may be able to enjoy all his effort in cultivating the mood and the characters and the neighborhoods a lot more.For now, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5, as mystery goes.I'm going right to ""Darkness, take my hand"", where Kenzie and Angie are still my favorite of his characters."
4,"Excellent writing, so-so ending","The characters literally live and speak as real human beings - that's how good the writer is. You already know what the story is about - the film should be interesting. My main problem is the believability of the killer and how things are TOO neatly tied up at the end. Aside from that very minor flaw, this is a must read for anyone interested in fine writing of any genre."
2,Definitely not on a par with the Kenzie/Gennaro books,"I am a big fan of Dennis Lehane's series featuring Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, and I purchased ""Mystic River"" the day it hit the stands. I was very disappointed with it, and so was a friend of mine (also a fan) who read it. The plot is slow, the characters are seedy, the ending is depressing . . . At the end, I was wondering ""why did he write this book?""Save your time and read Mr. Lehane's ""Prayers for Rain"" instead; it's ten times better than this one."
4,Did some ringers for the Publisher write all these reviews?,"4 Stars for the solid writing & major effort by the author. 2 Stars for yet another unhappy story of life in the big city with murder, mayhem, pedophiles, drugs & fill in the blank. Could not endear myself to one character in the book. I like the author. Went to a reading for this book he did over a year ago at the Boston Public Library. Have read his other books & promoted them to other readers. This is a movie script ala Richard Price. Hope it grosses more than ""Clockers."" Huge ensemble, let's cast it!"
2,"Sleepy, boring surprise","I was excited to see a new Lahane. Though never did one need to be Einstein to read his books, I always really enjoyed reading the last few books. This was just boring, way to long and I really just wanted it to end. If I were an author I would want to write different things too but this did not work."
1,Who Needs This Garbage?,"Does the world really need more books about pyschos and serial killers? First of all, it's become a boring cliche, and Mystic River is almost interchangeable beyond some details with too many other dreary and disgusting (non)mysteries. Second, does the world really need this theme perpetuated? Lehane may have made a financial killing here, but in spreading the ""romance"" of pyschokillers he's done us all a disservice. Maybe this is corny, idealistic raving, but you've got to start somewhere in trying to make the world a better place. And anyway, in the end, this book is dull. I've got to believe its success is pure hype and not based on its (lack of) literary merits."
1,Fizzle,"Started out okay, but a puerile ending.And deceitful. Lehane strings us along, letting us think Dave bludgeoned Katie -- strings us along as, granted, all whodunits do. Trouble is, Lehane gets deep into Dave's head and allows the reader to know his most secret thoughts -- in which case we'd have known from the beginning the truth about what Dave did.Also far too much digression and explanation. Lehane should've borrowed Basil Exposition from the Austin Powers movies.But the ending (aka who killed Katie): just unbelievable."
3,Intense!!!!,"A hard boiled mystery set in working class Boston. Jimmy, Sean, and Dave are boyhood friends until the day Dave gets abducted. All three boys are forever changed and they go their separate ways. 25 years later the three are reunited under grisly circumstances- the murder of Jimmy's 19 year old daughter. The thing I liked most about this novel, is that a good portion of it is ""in the head"", getting into the psyches of the characters. A good choice for when you are stuck in bed with the flu."
4,Mystic River is an intense read,"Having just finnished Mystic River by Dennis Lehane, I would like to share my likes and dislikes. I found the plot to be excellent especially for those who enjoy murder mysteries. Truthfully, I found the book to be too graphic, and some of the characters were not entirely realistic in my opinion. Also, one of the subjects discussed in this book is child molestation, and since it is essential to the plot, it isn't something someone could just skip. This bool is somewhat depressing which makes ithard to pick up and read, although towards the end the plot is so suspenseful that it is hard to put down."
5,Great Detective Page Turner! WOW!,"Purchased this book on Friday and finished it on Sunday. Couldn't put it down. Definitely an A+ pager turner. Lehane develops his characters with wonderful detail, giving full attention to the intricacies of their minds so that you felt their emotions in your own soul. This story never lagged and played a whodunnit guessing game throughout the entire book. By the novel's end, I kept wanting more! Keep em coming!"
5,Truer to Life than Patrick and Angie,"Those who believe that Patrick and Angie are true-to-life may well not enjoy Mystic River. Readers who believe life is more complex than that portrayed in Lehane's earlier, admittedly enjoyable, novels, will find Mystic River a welcome sign of Lehane's continued growth as a novelist. Life in the big city is, indeed, depressing, or at least has palpably depressing aspects. Heroes are rare, and despair is the fabric of daily life. Lehane has chosen to portray life as it is rather than to resolve the lives of his characters with clever endings and deux ex machina intervention. In my opinion, a more subtle book than the Patrick/Angie efforts and, therefore, as satisfying if not as therapeutic."
5,This is one fantastic writer,"I've read Lehane's Kenzie and Gennaro detective series and couldn't put them down. I've found the same thing in Mystic River. Same gritty type of voice, but not in the first person. Lehane makes you feel like you are in his scenes. He certainly has his views about certain things that he slips in, but Lehane doesn't preach. He just delivers high-quality stories."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I'm not much of a mystery fan; I was drawn in by the promise that Lehane wrote prose that was as much literature as genre fiction, drawing comparisons not merely to Elmore Leonard and Springsteen but even Hemingway. Those raves must have come from the easily impressed. What I found was overwritten (so much for Hemingway and Springsteen), hard-boiled bluster from the life-stinks-and-then-you-die school. The problem isn't that the worldview is dark and depressing; it's that Lehane hits you over the head with this revelation over and over again, and the attitude is coming not so much from the blue-collar characters as an author who, despite his pose of understanding, is looking down on his creations. A good editor could have shaved this by at least 100 pages, and an author less impressed with the sound of his own voice might have plotted a mystery that contained a surprise or two. If you're looking for a literary mystery, keep looking."
2,"oh, come on","lehane has intelligent things to say about the other side of gentrification. (thus the 2 stars). so why not write a real novel about it? wrapped up in this pedantic police procedural, where the reader knows everything before the cops do, so we're forced to slug through them figuring it out, his ideas lose all their force.By the way, does every victim need to have their face punched in so badly you 'can't even tell what race they were'?this is genre airport reading that shows promise, but has not achieved anything close to the ecsatic reviews above.But, police mysteries can be brilliant, with real socical inight and value.Want to see how its done? Read 'Clockers', by richard price."
3,ONLY FAIR!!!,"Seems like I am a minority of one as I read some of the other reviews. I nearly put the book down after about 80 pages because I thought it was so bad. I kept plugging and it did get better. I still skipped over several pages as I read because they just droned on and on really about nothing. Sean Devin, Jimmy Marcus and Dave Boyle have an experience when they are young that changes their live forever. The book then skips 15 years and starts with them as grown men. Katie Marcus, daughter of Jimmy, is killed. Sean Devine is a state trooper and working on the case. Dave ends up being a suspect. Who did commit the crime? That will be a little surprise, or was to me. But, who pays for the crime? Without saying to much, lots of people pay. A so-so book."
4,A very complex murder mystery,"Lehane is deservedly one of the better mystery/crime writers of the day. It is so much more complex than an old Mickey Spillane type of yarn. It deals with psychological complexity on a much more subtle way, attuned to the criminal underworld and the police structures. The degree to which both sides of the conflict arise from the same neighborhoods and milieu adds to the confusing struggle between good and evil. Both sides partake of the same conflicts, and Lehane does a very nice job interweaving these strains."
4,Good solid read,"I liked this book because I like crime dramas/mysteries in general, but I had also seen the movie with Sean Penn and Tim Robbins, and I thought the movie was great. It is not an ""easy"" read, but it deals with universal human themes such as love, loss, revenge, and the imperfections that come along with being human in a very relatable way."
2,Senslessly brutal,Very little literary value vs. a lot of gratuitous profanity and dull brutality.Not at all well crafted or creative.
4,Mystic river,Liked the twists and turns and the unpredictable turn of events. Recommend this book for all mystery readers. Thank you.
3,Slow,"This book was o-k. I was surprised by the ending, although not enough that I would recommend this book to someone."
2,Mystic River -- it is not my kind of book.,I read only the first 75 pages of Mystic River. There was too much profanity for me to enjoy the book.
4,An interesting ride...,"I just finished this book. I avoided watching the movie so I could read the book first. It was certainly different. The way the characters talked was interesting (and a little over the top), but still a great read. Towards the end there are definitely some (ugly) surprises. The last hundred pages of the book kept me really interested. I stayed up late finishing it. That's a good book when you ignore sleep for it. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants something a bit different. The ending was disturbing, but well written."
5,First-class crime fiction,"With MYSTIC ISLAND Lehane makes his bones as a first-class writer of crime fiction. His characters are complex, their motivations often heart-wrenching. The murder of a 19-year-old girl brings three childhood friends back together and stirs up sins from the past that resonate with the present investigation. Lehane has a gift for conveying sorrow, loss, and the everyday disappointment in his characters' lives while keeping us totally engaged in the plot. The emotions are the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy, but the story has the ring of ripped-from-the-headlines reality. One of his best and highly recommended."
5,no good guys no bad guys,"Mystic River is one of the most substantial books in any genre that I've read in a long time. Every character comes alive on the page, complete with enough condensed history to flesh out even the minor players. ""Good"" and ""evil"" exist as a backdrop but do not motivate the characters. My initial concern that the childhood tragedy that propels the rest of the story was an overdone theme was quickly overcome by the surprising direction that followed. Almost everyone in the book is testing the limits of love and finding out how far they will go to keep it. The three central figures, boyhood ""friends"" Sean, Dave, and Jim, are as conflicted about their actions as they are about the the nature of their relationships. They find very different ways of coping with both the past and the present, all taken to the extreme. Fate is the underlying catalyst, but the heart of this story is what they bring upon themselves."
5,So gripping I could not wait to get home each day to read it,"I have not read a book this powerful in a very long time. It grabbed on to me and would not let go. Just when I thought I had something figured out, the next chapter brought on something more. I went straight to the theater to see the movie after finishing the book. First off, I could not understand why Jimmy's last name was changed from Marcus to Marcum. Then felt that the movie left out so many key elements from the book. With only five minutes of the men as boys, it did not give you a chance to see their personalities. I give the movie a C, but the book an A+++++++. I now plan on reading future Dennis Lehane books. Thank you Dennis for a fine piece of work."
4,"Dark, disturbing, depressing, but........","This was the first of Lehane's books that I picked up and I must admit that it was gripping and suspenseful. However, I was not ready for the brutal reality that hit me. This book is dark, disturbing, depressing and even made me mad at some points. But Lehane is truly a master. He pulls you in and won't let you go. His character development is some of the best I've ever read. I was still thinking about this book several days after finishing it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I just didn't buy the ending. I've read Shutter Island since, a truly spectacular ending, and two of the Kenzie/Gennaro novels, and their endings are much better. If you haven't read Lehane yet, be warned. It will cause you to wince and squirm in your seat. I would compare his reads to that of Larry McMurtry, whose Lonesome Dove series spares no expense at capturing the brutal reality of the western frontier in the 1800's."
4,A great read with one major flaw **SPOILER***,"***SPOILER***Loved the writing and the story. I figured out who did it relatively early in the story, but I had the reason wrong. I thought that Brendan's brother had figured out that Brendan was going to leave him with their awful mother, and that drove him to kill Katie. It seems hard to believe that the beating would have been so vicious just ""because"". However, I can let that go because it was a really great story."
1,"Coarse, tough-guy fantasies","I thought this one was probably worse and even more gimmicky than Shutter Island. I had a hard time keeping the characters straight and, worse, it didn't really seem to matter anyway. And what was with all that coarseness? Does this guy think he's David Mamet? Sam Shepard? What?I think that coarseness was really what did the novel in for me. No one really seemed to care about anybody else. Not that I need (or even want) a whole lot of love and emotion dripping from any novel, but there was no connection between these characters at all that served to pique my interest. It was almost an insult to working class neighborhoods in the East. The portrayal seemed to be more of Lehane's rough-and-tough-guy fantasies than anything else."
2,skip it!,"This book was very easy reading and very predictable. The basic story line is three very young friends have this bad experince between them. They grow older and their lives once again come together with a all new tradgey. I found the book very dry and it left a bad taste in my mouth. This is the first Lehane book I have read, My advice would be to skip the book and watch the movie...."
2,A disappointment,"I had been anxiously awaiting this book after reading Mr. Lehane's previous titles. Unfortunately, this book was not worth the wait. The characters could have been interesting, but they seemed a bit two-dimensional."
2,"His first 5 books were great, this one was not.","I must have gotten used to the main characters in his first five books. I was really disappointed in this one. Please Dennis, go back to the first characters for the next one."
1,Can put it down and did,"I made it through page 50 or so. It's excrutiating; almost every paragraph makes me cringe: Oh what melodrama, Oh sigh, foreshadowing alert, foreshadowing alert. I already know all the sterotypes: the abused child, the angry child. Lehane has nothing to add to those sterotypes - not a single engaging insight.I liked Lehane's first four books. Maybe when he returns to the characters he knows best, I'll read him again. Until then, I have categorized him as an author who has lost his edge."
1,"Excellent writing, poor choice of characters. Disturbing.","An extremely dark and disturbing story about sick people.Low lifes all, except the cop Sean, who deliver their thoughts and their lines out of some pathetic emotional selfishness, devoid of honest conscience or respect for fellow humans. I have read 5 of LeHane's books. This is the only one I regretted reading."
4,Good Read,"This was a great story. A good, quick read. Something a little different. Dennis Lehane did a great job. Definitely read before watching the movie."
5,This is a must read!,"This book is marvelous and very moving.Even though I have seen the film quite a few times, the book was still amazing to me.If you have seen the movie the main plot of the book does not differ from the movie. The book offers a little more background and of course talks about what the characters are thinking/feeling more than the movie.If you haven't seen the movie, read the book first!"
3,Mystic River,It seemed to take to long to get through this book. It was losing interest half way through it. It also kind of leaves you wanting a explantion as to what happens to the killers.
2,My first experience reading this author,"From reviews, I thought I would enjoy this book but found it difficult to figure out where it was going. I kept reading, thinking it was just a slow developing story. I found it very depressing with no hope of it improving and so I finally gave it up - unable to finish reading the whole story. I even went back to the reviews to make sure that I was not missing something but found that - yes- the reviewers enjoyed this type of writing. - not me."
4,Great story,"This is simply a great read. We have interesting characters and a well woven story. This author consitantly delivers good stories. For those who are unfamiliar with Dennis Lehane, if you like a mystery, rich characters and twists, give this a try."
5,Gripping,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Hard to put it down at nite! So many twists and turns. I could relate to the characters.
2,Sounds familiar,Sounds sorta kinda like the true story 'Sleepers' by Lorenzo Carcaterra. I recommend 'Sleepers'. I don't have anything real positive to say about Mystic River.
1,Good Book--VERY FUNNY,"I thought this book was hilarious. The Character, Dave, is constantly cracking jokes. He is so funny. I was laughing to myself when the professer came by. I was sent out of the classroom for disrupting the class. Oh well, the book is excellent."
1,Does this clown even know where the Mystic is!?,"The Mystic and Southie and Dorchester? That's like basing the MOB is Wellesley! For those that care, the Mystic borders Arlington, Medford, Somerville, Everett and Charlestown, all north of Boston(any part). Give this guy geography lessons then go get a good Ludlum book?!"
4,Wonderful but soul trying,Mystic RiverThis is a dark work that really brings the feelings of characters to life. Never read a novel where I more felt the pain and anguish of the characters. This guy really has a way with the psyche; almost painful at times but as realistic as a tragedy can be related.
2,Good book and easy to read,A good mystery. The author keeps you guessing to the end. I'm looking forward to more books from this author.
2,Slow and stuttered,"Started out good and intriguing and went downhill from there. Rarely do this, but literally skipped pages as there was just too much (repeated often). As it was primarily about three men, I found it interesting to ""listen"" to some of their thoughts, but parts of the story line were just too stunted. Certain story lines could have had more to them where the 'personal thoughts' could have been much more limited."
3,Real,Took awhile to get into this book but after a while you could hardly put it down.I felt like I was there!
5,A genre of its own,"This book truly functions on each and every level. This book uses mystery, drama, character developement, fantastic prose, and magnificent use of figurative language to convey a well developed story. The fact that all of the characters have their own vices and virtues really makes it stand apart from the traditional mystery, in that their respective qualities affect their decisions."
2,Inutterably tedious,"Lehane is no Raymond Chandler. This book is short on dialogue and short on action. 90 per cent of the inexcusably long 400 pages consists of self indulgent and tedious narrative. Every stray thought from every character who wanders into the book is unloaded onto the hapless reader. It is full of teenage angst and false passion. Having purchased the audio book version, I had to further endure the over excited narrator's lapses when his 3rd generation Irish characters mysteriously developed Belfast Irish accents (BBC version)."
4,Sucks you in,"I can't think of a better way to spend a weekend then curling up with this book. It sucks you right in and makes you want to read the whole thing in one sitting. Sure, the prose gets a little histrionic at times but it's easily overlooked. And yes, the big ""coincidence"" is a little hard to swallow as well as the assertion that those molested all become molesters, but that's easily forgiven.I especially enjoyed the exploration of different marital and family relationships and the poignant portrayal of the haves vs. the have-nots. As far as the characters go, I defy anyone to not love the Savages. The importance of each wife's supporting role is particularly brilliant. I also love Jimmy's character and the final emotionless acceptance of his true nature.All in all a dang good read!"
3,Does Not Live Up To Hype,"Lehane's words are poetic and at times the writing is beautiful. This is a depressing story with sad characters. Don't bother reading if you're looking for a ""fun"" read. I, like others, found the ending unsatisfying. Also, the real killer was obvious by page 298. Not sure if I was suppose to know who dunnit but I'm sure any reasonbly alert person will figure it out. I liked Trooper Devines character the best and I'm guessing we'll see him in a future Lehane novel. All in all, not great but worth the read. If your looking for police procedurals read Michael Connely's brilliant ""Bosch"" books or even John Sandfords ""prey"" series."
4,"Thought I'd be bummed, but oh man...","Was so excited when amazon emailed me that a new Dennis Lehane book was coming out, immediately checked it out and was so disappointed that it wasn't a Kenzie-Gennaro book. When it came out, I didn't buy it. Thought, no, I want an Angie & Patrick book. Kept seeing that this one was getting great reviews, and decided maybe I would relent and read it, but didn't know if I would buy it in hardback. Then, a friend (whom I had told about Lehane in the first place) read it and told me that it was great. So, as we were leaving town I picked it up from her, and it was sooooo great! The characters are great, the story is great, and now Lehane has created yet another story primed for serialization, and I'm not sure which one I want him to come out with next.Please, if you love Lehane, or are new to him, go and get this book now!"
5,A Heartwrenching Tragic Page Turner,"This book is like driving by an accident site; You can't turn away, but instead are forced to slow down with morbid curiosity.This was the first of Dennis Lehane's books I've read, but you can bet I'm going to snap the rest of them up now. He's a phenomenal writer with a gift for crackling dialogue, and fascinating multi-level characters.It's the story of three boys, Sean, Jimmy, and Dave, one of whom gets abducted, but escapes. Twenty five years later the estranged men's lives converge when one of their daughters is brutally murdered.No one gets out clean in Lehane's world, and the brilliant unravelling mystery creates a tragic chain reaction. With the domino effect in mind, it reminded me in tone of ""A Simple Plan."" I read the other day that Clint Eastwood has bought the movie rights to ""Mystic..."". I hope he can do justice to this moody, evocative, and excellently written book."
2,Implausible and irredeemable,"Too many loopholes and too many unanswered questions in a story that should have been tight. The three main characters bumble around, creating their own tragedies. The wives are pathetic, as are the police investigators. The story doesn't seem realistic, even if it is trying to portray the gritty underside of life. This is what's supposed to happen to people touched by child abuse? This is a new kind of vigilanteism? This is Boston in the year 2000?"
1,Soppy River,"Lehane's latest effort is a great disappointment. It is self-important, bloated and a waste of time. It lacks the wit and tang of his detective series and instead moves with a snail's pace through a neighborhood no one but a resident would find interesting."
1,Dark Dismal Depressing,"When this book first came out, I passed it by because of the subject matter. But then I read Lehane's Shutter Island and liked it very much. I took a look at all the glowing reviews and heard that Clint Eastwood was going to make a movie of Mystic River and decided to give it a try. Big Mistake. I just don't understand why dark, dismal, depressing stories pass for artistic writing these days. When one of the characters (Dave Boyle) recounts his take on how baseball fans react when their team looses, it was so far over the top I had to wonder at the author's sanity. I struggled through to the end hoping for an uplifting resolution, but I didn't find it. I realize I am in the minority here. I can not think of a single reason to recommend this book. I was not enlightened and I was not entertained. I feel like I wasted my time."
3,3.5 stars,I think this is not a bad book and it is not the best book I have ever read. There are few parts of the story which i do not like:1. dave killed [......] and lied to his wife that he killed a robber.2. dave's wife went first to jimmy marcus instead of the police to say that she suspected her husband killed katie. i think she should try to understand why dave behaved strangely instead of running away.3. jimmy marcus killed [....]. dave had already explained that he did not kill [....] and jim did not listen to him.
3,I'd say it was closer the 2.5 stars...,"I bought this book on tape after seeing the trailer for the upcoming movie, which was so compelling with such an impressive cast, and was a little upset that I didn't like the book more.I'm not sure if it's because I listened to it on tape instead of reading it myself, which is something I've only ever done once before, but I figured out the ending. Plus or minus a few details I figured out very early who had done what and why. Maybe it was a fluke but I found the end to be very anti climactic and even a little upsetting after reading the epilogue. I was just curious if other people figured it out as well... or if maybe I shouldn't listen to books on tape anymore.The characters were interesting, and really well developed, but now I question how the movie will incorporate so much inner dialogue. I just found the overall story to be a little too predictable, I suppose one could say that's not a sign of a poorly planned plot, but really impressive foreshadowing."
5,Good Value,"The company that made these filters for my humidifier told me they had discontinued them. Went on Amazon and their they were. Fit them machine, are exactly the same as the ones I have bought previously and less expensive. I bought two (1 for next year)"
5,Well worth the wait,"It took 41 years, but we finally have them all, and in glorious black & white! I loved these as a 6 year old and appreciate it even more now. Looking back at these, I see their influence on more mainstream shows like Star Trek (Space City's chief engineer was even Scottish...beam me back to '62 Scotty!). The re-mastering is superb, the bonus stuff is great. I wish there had been some sort of guide book in the set with info about the episodes, but all-in-all it's still a great set. A must-have for fans and campy fun for everyone else."
3,Fireball XL-5 never thought I would see it released,"I inquired about the series years ago and was told whom ever had the rights to it, they were sitting on it. I was floored when I saw it here.BUT, the price is out of line. $50 for 39 episodes of a B&W; puppet show??"
5,Memories in Black and White.,"The quality of the reproduction is excellent. The memories relived are great. The only problem I have is not watching all the episodes at once, you can bet I'll be watching the episodes of Fireball XL5 again and again and again."
1,Aweful,"Horrible dvd. Picture quality is aweful, equivalent to watching a VHS that has been watched a couple of hundred times. Opposite of relaxation, I wanted slow motion but this whole thing is too fast. Also, I have never seen the northern lights look so bad, never. Don't buy this dvd. This was a one man operation, by an individual that googled a bunch of clips and pieced it together on his PC. They say there is a sucker born every minute and this time I was that sucker."
1,disappointing cliché,"I teach film & video production & in preparation for a course I will soon teach, ""Observations in High Speed & Time Lapse,"" I purchased this DVD, hoping it wd be something I cd share with my students as an example. I am very disappointed. Even with vacuous music turned off, the edited structure of this video & the majority of the image choices are hackneyed & vapid. Definitely not a worthwhile purchase for the contemplative viewer. I won't show this to my students or ever spend time looking at it again."
2,there are far better nature dvds,"i was very disappointed with this when i got it. with this type of thing one always runs the risk of getting a very new-agey product that is heavy-handed with cheesy music. the images are sometimes nice, but there is definitely much better stuff out there"
3,It's ok..,"I purchased this moisturizer about 8 weeks ago. I have dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin and used this moisturizer in the evening. It wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin and I didn't notice much difference with my acne. I'm going back to Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle-Night with retinol. It's much more effective as a moisturizer, an exfoliant and helping with my break outs."
5,Great and Cheap!,"This is the first moisturizer I've used in years that did not cause my skin to break out. Additionally, it softens well and I've seen a reduction in discolorations. I will purchase this item again."
4,Hasn't arrived yet!!!!,"This product was purchased june 26th 2011, it hasn't arrived yet.Frouke Pittelkow"
1,Suzy,"I used Actifed for over 30 years -- it was a great product -- until the government said in 2006 that it had to go behind the counter & Pfizer foolishly changed the formula instead. The new formula doesn't work. Any company that produces the old formula, triprolidine & hydrochloride, can take Pfizer's business away. To put the name Actifed on Pfizer's now useless product is really a misrepresentation to the public."
1,Save your money,"I've taken the ""old"" formula of Actifed (Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride) for almost three decades - with great results. This ""new"" version doesn't work; save your money and buy something else."
1,New formula works poorly,Try 'Aprodine' by Major Pharmaceuticals ( 734.743.6000 )Original 60mg / 2.5mg formula.Ask the pharmacist for them and sign the book - you can buy 2 boxes per visit in California.Under $4.00 for 24 tablets.Compare to the original 'Actifed'
1,"New actifed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sucks !","Other brands available behind the counter that use the old formula include Genac and Aprodine. USA pharmacy chain Walgreens' house-brand version of Actifed, Wal-Act, also continues to use the original pseudoephedrine/triprolidine formula,,,,,THE ORIGINAL FORMULA ACTIFED(the one that actually works) contains 60 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride as the nasal decongestant and 2.5 mg triprolidine hydrochloride as the antihistamine.Plus I think you can still buy the original formula from other countries."
1,So dissappointed,We can't get Actifed here in Canada anymore either even though pseudoephedrine products are still on open drugstore shelves. What a shame. I believe I have used this product for 50 years: is that possible? I used to rely on it for hayfever but now as a decongestant -- it seems to be the only allergy/cold medicine available without acetaminophen or tylenol. I can't tolerate acetaminophen.
1,Try this one guys,"I think it's Walgreens version of the old formula...definitely makes you drowsy. The old actifed was great, and this seems to work for me like the old Actifed[...]"
4,Interesting Character Study.,"This French Canadian film about a middle-aged man who is forced to re-enter his life as a pornographic filmmaker because of his need for money is quite thought provoking. The film he makes acts as a sort of emotional backdrop that propells him to think about his own personal misgivings and his estrangement from his son. For those of you looking for lots of gratuitous sex you will be disappointed. There are several quite graphic scenes, but they are far from titillating. This is not a sex film. Recommended for its quiet, reflective nature."
3,Not What You Think,"Personally, I felt this film really captures the essence of pornography and its affects on people. If this was your business, how would it affect your life? How would you grow old? How would you go mad?Jean-Pierre Leaud plays a fifty year old director of pornographic films who finds himself working again after a long absence. But, while his reasons for doing it in the 60's might have been revolutionary, they are now purely financial.This film is about loss. The loss of contact with his son, both his wives, his friends, and ultimately his mind as the director withdraws into a tiny clean room.Ironically, the sex scenes occur early in the film. They seem all the more disturbing because we are behind the scenes (so to speak) with the characters. They decrease allowing us to engage with the character. A bit depressing, but overall, a good film."
2,WELL DONE BUT KINDA OBVIOUS,"THE PORNOGRAPHER (Koch Lorber) is Betrand Bonello's explicit and controversial portrait of Jacques, a once famous and acclaimed -- but now burned out -- 50 year old pornographer from the 70s who tries to get back in the business of erotic films for the bucks.However, he soon sadly discovers that he has lost his passion personally and professionally and must examine his own life and the trajectory that has brought him to this place. Jacques descends into a lonely isolation as he disconnects with his son, two ex-wives and finally himself.Be warned, there's brief but very explicit sex."
4,Interesting film and probably not what people would think.,"Not what everyone would think firsthand in general opinion this film covers the life of the subject, the filmmaker, and everyone he impacts in life. A moving, though agreeing with another reviewer possibly perceivably boring or rather slower pace, look at the real lifes of him, friends, coworkers, and family. About life and a good presentation. Worth watching even if you don't agree with the title and topic. A bit of warning though some scenes are not recommended for minors."
3,Very Mediocre,"A fair French movie about this ageing porn director whos too 'accomplished' to do anything else. There are some nice visuals & cinimatography, and even some good dialog here but then theres the sub-plot with his alinated son that comes from nowhere & then goes nowhere. There is one hardcore scene in here but its meant to show how the main character hates being on the set. But, its shot from across the room, in picture frame, so its not really even graphic enough that you relate to his discomfort. Dont expect to be blow away by this one..."
4,scooby doo,scooby doo where are you: Volume 4 is just so great to watch for all ages. make you feel like a kids agian
2,WHERE'S WALDO?,"This film is so bad I thought it was a spoof of 70's action films complete with wack-a-da wack-a-da music and disco. Marko Zaror plays hit man Mandrill and is given a voice that sounds like Jason Statham. His parents were killed by a hit man named ""Cyclops"" who lost an eye during the incident. He has become Mandrill's target. Earlier we saw Mandrill looking for a guy named Waldo, asking everyone ""Where's Waldo."" You can't help but laugh. There are flashbacks to his youth and his TV idol, John Colt, an oriental action hero who is also unintentionally comical.In order to get to ""The Cyclops"" Mandrill must get the information from his daughter who he woos.Terrible acting and dubbing.No f-bombs, brief sex? no nudity (arms in way). This film might be better to watch as an MST project."
3,"nice, but wordy","I do like this book and am glad I bought it, but it is for a more advanced reading than I thought it would be. Full pages of text as apposed to a short paragraph and lots of imagery. It's not yet reading level appropriate for my daughter. she get board of the story FAST. We'll get to it later."
5,A Practitioner's view of Estimating,"Agile Planning and Estimating is a core book for any practitioner of Agile. It provides a solid foundation to begin from and as one improves their skills, this book serves as a base station to plan the options that best fit your organization's culture and rhythm.Along with Mike's first book, the Agilist and the traditional manager have a fresh, reasonable,empirically based, and experienced driven approach to offset that wave of realization that you have absolutely no idea what you have gotten yourself into."
4,Excellent,"This book has all the information needed for start working and refining scrum estimation. The only complain I have is the chapter over deciding between story points and ideal days, you should skip it(just use story points) and everything else is very valuable."
5,Agile and not scrum,"I've been doing scrum for quite a while and really appreciated this book as it is *not* specifically scrum and adds other very interesting techniques to use. My favorite is planning poker, which basically all my teams use now with great success.A must to round out your Agile understanding."
5,Your Resource for Agile Planning,"Recently someone asked me if I knew of any trainers in agile estimation techniques in my geographical area. I strongly recommended that he engage Mike Cohn and if Mike were unavalable to purchase a copy of this excellent book. I had the fortune of being an early reviewer of the book, and am not disappointed in the final product. If the book Planning eXtreme Programming was the skeleton, this book is the meat that provides excellent coverage of the following:* estimation techniques in terms of time and effort* business valuation of stories* release planning* iteration planningI highly recommend this books to all agile teams."
5,This is a great book that keeps on giving advice,"This is such a great book for reading and re-reading. I find new nuggets of information each time I go back to it. If I get stuck, or a situation arises, I know I can turn to this book for my answer. It took me a bit to get into this book the first time. I think it was because I thought his first bookUser Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development (The Addison-Wesley Signature Series)was so darn good. What could Mike possibly add to that piece of work? Well, a lot. Every team should have this book available for consultation. It is the next best thing to having Mike there in person!"
5,Practical techniques that deliver immediate results,"As a software program manager, I'm always looking for ways to improve my estimates and the estimates of the teams I work with. Regardless of what is built, we need to ensure the project is the right thing and delivering it at the right time. Being predictable, both on a short-term and long-term basis, is key to project success.This book will address all of the above items, and more. I have found that the techniques described in this book not only helped our team in improving our estimates, they also helped with stakeholder communications, predictability and improving overall product quality.Readers of this book will be able to walk away with new techniques that can be practiced and implemented on day one. If you stick to your guns, you will see immediate results.As a scrum coach inside our company, this book is a great addition to my ""must read list"". Truly a great read."
2,Another Agile disappointment,"I'm beginning to wonder how many agile books I can buy/read which say essentially the same thing. I bought this one because it looked like it covered some of the areas my team is struggling with in our 1 year/1,000 Story project. It is a light and easy to read, but it didn't ever seem to get beyond the basics and there wasn't anything I could suggest for our next retrospective...."
4,A Detailed Guide To Estimation and Planning,"I read this book as part of a reading circle, so I went in not overly excited about the topic having already read several books that claimed to cover estimation. I didn't expect to learn much, but I wanted to participate in the group discussion. I don't think I could have been more wrong, this book was full of useful information from the trenches and strategies for adapting estimating to your company's process. The book does a great job of breaking down planning into levels, describing how much effort should be put into each level's plan, and then showing how the plan is executed. I especially enjoyed the section on calculating business value, I had never had luck translating the complexities of developing a user story into numbers that could be understood by the business stake holders in a project. I'm looking forward to implementing some of these strategies in my upcoming projects."
5,Excellent book,"Excellent book. Sincerely I see how it inspired other booksScrum, The Complete Overview and Guide (Boxset), For the Agile Scrum Master, Product Owner, Stakeholder and Development Team (inspired by Ken Schwaber, Mike Cohn, Jeff Sutherland)"
4,Very good approach,"Good examples, well written chapters and the way the book is structured, all that give you a good and rather practical idea of how Agile PM should be performed. I have found it very elaborating and i should say I was pleased with my purchase."
5,Essential reading for Agile development,This book explains the in and outs of Agile development in an extremely concise and clear manner.Essential reading for agile team
5,My kids love these!!!,"I have to admit I love these cookies too. It's a crunchy lemon cookie, in the shape of a polar bear, covered in a white icing. They are sweet and very yummy. We took them on a picnic once and the icing got pretty soft but that still didn't keep the kids out of them!"
3,Quick summer read,"This was an okay book. It was light and humorous, along the lines of a Janet Evanovich novel. It was the kind of book you'd read at the beach, or when you don't want to get into anything heavy. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a quick, fun read."
3,"Total farce, but an enjoyable way to waste an afternoon","Cute read. Not my usual book selection so I am always thrilled when I walk away not feeling like I wasted my time.It was light, funny at times, and bizarre enough that it didn't intrude on reality for me. Characters aren't overly deep, but the story line makes up for it and distracts you from lesser character development. The thief was probably my favorite character in the story.Worth the read if this genre doesn't annoy you."
4,Maybe Baby,"I enjoyed this book, in fact I stayed up late to finish it which is rare. I thought the main character was a bit annoying but it didn't take away from the overall story. Babs is hilarious and the bird/chicken storyline is just fantastic. A refreshing break to an otherwise boring bunch of books I have read lately. Heading over to buy more from this author!"
3,Just ok.....,"I really liked the ""Fortune Quilt"" by this same author but was kind of disappointed in this story. I didn't get attached to the characters like I wanted to. I never really cared much about what happened in the story and found myself skimming past pages of text just to finally get to some ending.It's an alright book and fast to read. The communication between some of the characters is pretty funny and witty which was the best part of the book.If you like light hearted comedy/romance you'll like this book."
4,You could feel the chemistry.,What a fun and amusing story. You could feel the chemistry between the two even though they tried to fight it. Glad when they finally allowed their feelings to come out.
3,Facing your mistakes,"Facing your mistakes takes courage. Dana moves in and out of courageous. Her mother is a riot - literally. Being from the West coast, a New York winery is a new thought. All the elements work together to form a nice book. Nothing special, but definitely nice."
2,Funny and lovely,"I am certain that any reader will enjoy this story.I am not rating it higher because there were some time frame mistakes, but I really enjoyed reading it!"
3,"Not nearly as good as ""Life Against Death""","This is a profound and learned book that is experienced as much as read. It is a series of meditations, inspired by a wide range of other thinkers who are referenced after each section, as opposed to the unified argument put forward in Life Against Death. few of these aphorisms are enough to think about at one time. Among others Freud, Blake, Buddhism, Roheim, and Nietzsche are refered to.Unfortunately, Brown is too wrapped up in religous mysticism and theistic nonesense. That's why I took off two stars; religous undertones aren't part of any ubiquitously coherent work and they're too prevalent here. If you can filter them out, this work is otherwise decent.Brown was a a heavy influence on Jim Morrison and the music of The Doors, which is filled with Brownian imagery as are Morrison's books of poetry. ""Crowds and Power"" by Elias Canetti is another good book to read. It also has that typical Brownian style."
3,Good for a basic chatty starter book,"I would recommend this book more for people who are just starting out in the entertaining world (like the sorority sister mentioned in one of the reviews) than for the more seasoned party-givers. I bought it based on all the reviews form these party-seasoned folks and had expected something, well, more advanced. I will copy out some of the good recipes, but I don't need all the prose. I will either regift to a younger person or donate to the library booksale. Have to say that this is my first ""bad"" purchase (out of a gazillion) based on reviews, though, so thanks to all you writers out there who do give your opinions!"
5,Great for preschoolers,"All the Caillou videos are adorable. They are short and keep the attention of preschool age little ones. The stories are current and, while they tell a story, the kids are entertained while they are getting a lesson in life. And Caillou's parents are so supportive - a lesson some parents need to learn."
4,Good...,This purchase I made for my daughter as caillou is her favorite character and she like this very much. Worth buying...I recommend...
5,This is a great DVD for any age!,"I love watching this DVD and I'm 14 years old! I shows that even though your not tall, you can still do great things. Also, Caillou tries to trick the tooth fairy, the family car breaks down, and more!"
3,It's a Caillou DVD so it's not Citizen Kane,"It's Caillou. It's all about being nice when you don't feel like it when you're a preschooler. My kid likes it. It's touchy feely in the special Caillou way. No annoying Teddy, Gilbert and Rexy dolls - just straight up Caillou. This might be good if your kids are having issues."
3,The Kids love it.,"The Grand Kids love it. All the Girls want to watch is Cailou, so if it holds the attention of a 5 year old, a 3 year old and a 18 month old than I say it is good."
2,No French language,"This item is listed as having French audio available. However, there is only English available. I bought it for the reason that it did offer French. I am not sure this is worth the trouble of returning. Just an FYI for anyone else buying this for multiple languages."
3,Caillou: Big Brother & Other Adventures DVD~My Review,"I bought this particular Caillou DVD for my grandson, age 3 years and 8 months. Although the Caillou segments were cute, my grandson became frustrated ""waiting"" for Caillou segments with all the annoying puppet shows in between. There were also a couple of songs involving children.I'm not sure why there was all this other stuff in between. Maybe to make the DVD appear longer? Regardless, if you are willing to fast-forward through all the puppet shows after each Caillou segment, then it's a cute DVD."
2,Disappointed,"My granddaughter was very disappointed with this gift - she enjoyed the Caillou segments very much but did not like the puppets! Made me fast forward every time the puppets came on. Not very satisfactory. Makes me worry about ordering other Caillou DVD's for fear they will have the puppets, too."
2,Not the best Cailou Movie,"This is one of the older Cailou movies. It has the puppets in it that the kids tend to dislike. Cailou is pretty whiny in this DVD too. (Not like the more recent ones where Cailou is super sweet). My son (two and a half) loves Cailou and loves this video, though I think I will limit the amount of time he watches it. I think he can notice the difference in Cailou's behavior too. He gets a very serious look on his face when Cailou is misbehaiving. I reinforce that Cailou shouldn't act that way to teach him that it is not acceptable. I'd say try one of the newer Cailou movies. Read the other reviews to be sure that it is the newer movie; don't go strictly on the year of the video. Some are newer versions of the older movies."
3,Puppets,"My granddaughter absolutely LOVES Caillou. This video however, intersperses the animated segments with ""live"" puppets. A turtle, cat and one other one. She does not like the puppets and wants to see Caillou. So she does lose interest the minute the puppets come on."
5,Great for big brothers!,"My son is 2.5 years old and has had this DVD for over a year. He didn't get interested in it until recently when he's really understood what being a brother and sister means. My daughter is six months old, and now when the ""Big Brother"" song comes on, he goes over and hugs his sister. The video also shows how to play together and share toys - a very big thing in our house right now! Very Cute!"
5,Nothing but pure fun for kids!!,"Caillou has been a life saver. My 19 month old daughter absolutely loves this show. It is so cute and fun to watch. Unlike the review below, Caillou is so harmless!! How pathetic to absolutely ban CAILLOU from your home. To the person who wrote the bad review, to allow a DVD to set example for your kids! Come on now, sounds like your household is raised on videos only!"
1,"Horrible, Wretched Piece of Crap","Bought 3 a year or so ago, ordered 3 more and found they were re-designed and perform horribly. Spray changes over a short time with pure water and degrade rapidly. Do not buy."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Master impersonation plan.A Third Doctor story, and a malfunctioning TARDIS, too. As the Doctor is showing Jo his impressive piece of equipment it takes off on them and they are stranded in the middle of a dispute between workers and management on a mining colony world.A nasty shock is had by our favorite Time Lord when the master turns up as the labour arbitrator sent to deal with it."
4,Perceptions or Realties,"Can love be deceiving or what? Illusions Things are not always what they seem is a true romance. Does true love actually happen at first sight. Lea Mishell takes you on a realistic escaped love adventure. Passing the test of love and betrayal, with family and friendship being the allies can sure lay heavy on the heart. With the twist that takes place during this page turner, you never know who is going to end up with the passing grades until reaching the end and finding out whether or not love at first sight really happens! This novel is well written and the story line is truly developed"
4,The beginning of the decline,"King & Moore started out strong and kept sliding as they progressed. Potato Radio is the second outing from the duo and features much less of the stripped down instrumentation (just voice and bass) which marked their debut album, ""Impending Bloom"". Still, there are a number of great moments throughout the CD. It's a pity the duo never released a live CD. I saw them live in Portland summer of '92 and was left most impressed by the sounds that two people could make."
1,Save Your Money!,"Don't buy this one, it's pretty bad. Luckily, I borrowed it because if I had actually spent the $13.00 that it cost, I would have returned it the same day and asked for my money back.I forced myself to read/skim about half of it, but it never improved. The setting of the book- a nuclear devasted future- was interesting, but that can't make up for a totally unlikeable and abrasive heroine who feels as cartoonish as the front cover. With the addition of secondary characters who were uninteresting, a plot that was slow and boring, and sex scenes that fell flat, you've got a book that was too painful to get through. I wanted to stop after 15 pages, I wish I had."
4,Amazon's Cultural Complex at work??,"A colleague suggested I read this book because I often critique psychotherapy's emphasis upon the individual without attention to group dynamics as they express themselves in racism and sexism. Interestingly, Amazon only credits one of the co-editors, Tom Singer, as the ""author"" even though the book cover clearly lists Singer and Sam Kimbles as co-editors. Is this Amazon's own (unwitting) participation in the group dynamic of racism? Amazon lists the White man as but not the Black man? Where have I seen that before....."
5,Excellent Book!,It was very refreshing to see that others are finally picking up on something that I have been trying to explain to people about for years.Sizer puts it in easy to understand terms and presents it very well. I will refer friends to Sizer's book now rather than try to explain these ideas to people from now on.It is so hard to get people to open their minds to these truths after they have been bombarded for so many years by the sadly unscriptural beliefs of authors like Tim Lahaye and Hal Lindsey.I thank you Stephen Sizer!
2,not the best,"Im glad so many other people like this book, because I haven't been pleased by it at all. the directions aren't always clear, and so far what I've tried hasn't been very good. I tried to make the pancakes, and the batter was more like dough. Even my 6 year old son said, mommy it's supposed to be runny. The broccoli-rice casserole wasn't clear about how much rice to use. It said 2 cups, but didn't specify cooked or uncooked, so I ended up with way too much rice and nowhere near enoguh broccoli, and the sauce was gross..way too salty.Also, many of the recipes call for nutritional yeast which is not easily attainable, even in the healthfood sections of large grocery stores.I'd forego this book if I had to choose all over again."
3,Cool Cookbook,"I wouldnt say that this is a favorite of mines but it has a few recipes in it I like nothing you can find off the internet for free. But lets say you are the type like me who likes to have cookbooks then buy, Im sure you will find something in here you like. I havent tried all of the recipes yet, Im going to get around to it one day though."
2,very unhealthy recipes,"While the recipes are vegan, THEY ARE NOT FREE FROM REFINED SUGARS AND HYDROGENATED OILS. I am guessing that 15 years ago, when the book was published, there was less concern about these sugars and fats. In the savory dishes, an easy substitute for margarine is any oil that you include in your diet...but as for the desserts, I would consult a different cookbook altogether, one that recognizes unrefined sugars as better for you."
5,My most-used cookbook,"I collect vegetarian cookbooks and this is the one that I always go back to. I think it's especially great for people just going vegan because it has recipes for common everyday foods using common ingredients. I use the pancake and banana bread recipes on a weekly basis. I send recipes from this book to my sister who isn't a vegetarian but who is lactose-intolerant. She loves the recipes because she's a picky eater and won't eat anything ""weird""!"
4,The Compassionate Cook,Being a want-a-be vegetarian it was nice to finally find a vegetarian cookbook that had recipes of menu items that I was already using. The ingredients were items that I now carry in my kitchen with very few off the wall ingredients. The recipes are easy to follow and familiar. Thanks from the bottom of my healthy heart!
4,Overall not a bad book!,"This books offers a lot of interesting recipes. It gives wide variety of dishes, not simply one or two in each catagory. The recipes are very simple to make and taste delicious. Members of my family who aren't vegetarian liked them too. The only problem with this book is that the recipes tend to serve a large amount of people. If you are a single vegan, or the only one in you house, try to find a book where the recipe size is only for a few people. The recipes where great, but after having some of them for leftovers the entire week, you just don't appreciate them."
4,"Excellent, easy to follow recipes","I bought this vegan cookbook when it was first published (1994). My copy has completely fallen apart, so I decided to replace it. Although I am not vegan, this is still one of my favorite cookbooks all of these years later. The recipes are simple, easy to follow, and delicious. I am still finding new ones to try to this day."
5,"Yum! Easy, Tasty, Veg Recipes","I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to have an array of easy, healthy, vegan recipes at their fingertips. As someone who could burn water, I really appreciate that these recipes not only animal-friendly, they're family-friendly and beginner-friendly too! A must-have for any compassionate cook!"
3,The APA Style and Format Scavenger Hunt,"Problem: You are a student or professional of the Social Sciences; you must write research papers. You are required to follow APA style and format for your writings. Action: You acquire the APA ""bible,"" its Publication Manual, 4h edition. Problem: You now search for answers to your APA style and format questions. You scavenge for hours. Action: You know that the information you need is all there, but where? You experience the Psychological Rite of Passage known as the ""Twilight Zone of Altered States of Reference Logic."" Problem: The Manual is not intuitive. Solution: Develop your own cognitive cues and frames to make sense of the book's layout. Even though I was familiar with its third edition, I still used lots of post-it stick-em things temporarliy attached to sections. And then get on with it."
2,Not What I thought,I thought this was the most updated version of the manual and it was not. My fault for not doing my research.
3,A pretty gift idea,"Ruth Soffer has drawn eighteen flower blossoms for this Dover Publications tattoo book. Some of them (the carnation and the snapdragon) are less pretty than others, to my mind, but I heard no complaints when I gave it to my younger friends. There's a nice poinsettia and a chrysanthemum, and a sunflower and daisy and poppy, but the rest of them are more typical spring flowers. The violet is quite lovely, and the water lily and hibiscus are dainty and realistic. The other flowers depicted are buttercup, orchid, pansy, tiger lily, rose, iris, daffodil and tulip."
1,unreliable,"After purchasing this CD online, the seller informed me that he did not have the item. He offered me another CD without a refund."
4,A Special Friendship,"The book featured a special friendship between a bored girl and a boy her age with muscular distrophy. This is a great book for anyone, not just girls."
3,Very small!!,"While it is a fun toy, please make note of the size! the picture is deceiving, it is only about 7 inches long!"
5,Cesar Millan: People Training for Dogs is Great!!!!!!,"I discovered Cesar Millan's show ""The Dog Whisperer"" and got hooked on it. I tried to find additional information and training provided by Cesar and discovered this DVD.The training methods used made sense to me and gave me additional insights in to how dogs perceive humans and how they prefer to interact with one another and how we should interact with them on a daily basis.If you have dogs and you want to understand their psyche, this is a must have DVD. It will enlighten you and give you additional information you may not have been aware of before watching this DVD.I can't wait for his book to come out!!!!"
5,People trained,"This demonstration gives us the basis for a dog/human behaviorial/relationship. The question becomes who is the calm-leader and who is the calm-sumissive in the pack. Ceasar show how to bring even the most out of control ""family"" to a place of behaviorial calmness. Excellent!!!"
1,People Training for Dogs,"The biggest waste of money. The DVD gave no specifics on how to train a dog. A big come on for future DVD's.I will never purchase another of Millan's products again.My daughter recommended the DVD based on his TV appearence and she was ,also, disappointed."
3,"Pretty good, but too short","Cesar's ""Mastering Leadership Series"" is not as useful as the many seasons of his program, also available from Amazon on DVD. The single DVD's in this series are too short and too much in a lecture format, and not nearly as good a value as any season of his National Geographic channel Dog Whisperer. Still, it's Cesar, and he's really good at what he does."
5,Great training DVD.,My only complaint is that his training applies to adult dogs that have developed bad habits. I really wantedpuppy training for people.
5,Exceptional understanding of both dog and human.,Cesar is truly unique in his ability to explain in word and works how the canine thinks. He also goes to great detail in showing how the relationship between dog and human should be and the common mistakes we all make while thinking we are just showing them love. A real wake up call for us. He graciously shows us our place and theirs. Thank you Cesar. The only thing that would be better is to have one on one session with him.Cesar truly has a gift.
2,Over priced,"This DVD is over priced - only one-hour show shouldn't be charged more then $9.99 plus S&H; although I support Cesar very much and I had read his book Cesar's Way as well as I recently ordered his new DVD (Dog Whisperer With Cesar Millan - The Complete First Season (2004)), and I hardly missed his any show. I love nature and animals. I am licensed falconer and I trained my own dogs. I respect his talent, and learn a lot about dog behavior to watching his show, but I disagreed with other reviewers to giving him just positive rating and ignored all other negative facts. Being a strong critic is better and it will help Cesar to improve his work.Back to this DVD... if you are watching him on National Geography channel then do not throw away your hard earning money to buy this DVD. One hour show and cheap quality packing, bottom line this is a complete rip off."
2,Very Basic,"I feel over all this dvd is very basic and doesn't teach you anything to start training your dog. It is very basic and does not go into detail. I think it could have been more in depth. Just provides a very, very basic outline of the philosophy of training."
1,All talk...no dogs!,"I love Mr. Millan's TV show (The Dog Whisperer) and was looking forward to the DVD. But I was very disappointed that it's mostly just Mr. Millan lecturing to a room full of people. I want to see him interacting with dogs! Surely, all of the pointers he gives in this dvd would be better illustrated via demonstration than just talk.For his next dvd, I sincerely hope Mr. Millan will use more footage of his amazing work with dogs. I will be the first to buy it. This dvd, I'm sorry to report, I returned for a refund."
2,Mastering Leadership by Cesar Millon,"I recently purchased Cesar Millan's new DVD ""Mastering Leadership"" because we are getting rwo new puppies in 1 month.All the things that I've heard him say on his TV shows were said many times on this DVD. What I was hoping for is just exactly how you start out with a puppy and I didn't get that at all! I thought it was somewhat of a waste of money. Quite disappointed."
1,Not Helpful,"I recently got a young adult dog and a puppy which both need training so I decided to do it myself. Watching a little Dog Whisperer led me to this video which turned out to be totally useless. He explains the absolute basics on how to treat your dog, but no tips on how to actually train your dog to do anything. Useless."
4,Cesar DVD,"Love Cesar but this dvd is overpriced for the information. You're better off with the books, I think."
3,Good info but not so good training,"We love Ceasar Milan!! We were disappointed to but several of his DVD's however.Don't get me wrong. They are entertaining and informative yet they do not really show you ""HOW"" to train them.It is basically like watching his TV shows."
2,wait for the book,"I like and respect Cesar. I wanted to support him by purchasing the DVD.The content is great. Succinct and to the point. Fine.The value of the product is not. For $30 I expected 2 hours of material but the 1 hour made me feel like I'd been ripped off. If they'd charged $15, then it would seem a balanced transaction.So if you want to support Cesar then make a direct donation to his Dog Psychology Center or mail him a $20 bill.... and wait for the book."
1,Not worth the money TV show is more in depth than this DVD,"As another reviewer I was very disappointed with this DVD Cesar takes 55 minutes to explain his approach which you can learn in 15 minutes from watching his show. I learned nothing new.I respect Cesar and his abilities and I hope that he will come out with a more comprehensive DVD in the future, so save your money and buy that one when it comes out. This one is not worth its 30.00 price tag. You will be better served by watching his show."
4,Great insight into how to approach dog ownership....,"but I had hoped that it would have in depth training techniques.Cesar's insight into they 'psychology' of a dog has been very helpful in retraining our approach to our own pets, and the way that we live with them. This dvd illustrates these points in an easy to understand manner. Cesar is a very likeable and engaging man, and his obvious calm assertive demeanor works with people as well as dogs.I would love for him to make a followup program to this that illustrates proper techniques to use for specific issues. I've gotten more in that area from the TV show than I did from this dvd."
4,Great start,"This DVD is a great start to understanding more about dogs,whether you've own a dog for decades or just a few days.I've had my dog for 4 years and had never realized I'm a follower, even with those signs like walking out the door first,walking ahead of me,etc. After watching this 45 min short DVD, I understand more on how to correct the problem.You will not get the details of HOW to train your dog but I feel that as long as you understand and acknowledge what your problem is, the problem will be resolved very soon."
2,Not That Great,"I was looking for a video that showed the English countryside, and this was not it! Too commercial and urban, with outdated ""travel tips"" (to be fair, it does date from 1998!)."
3,Missing Appendix A suggests other poor planning.,"I guess I'm angry, after spending more time looking for the missing, and oft-referred to Appendix A than the authors spent planning (or writing) the book. ""A"" suggests even more than one (missing) appendix. The screen reproductions are impossible to read. The authors only ""present"" features of the language, they do not explain or teach it. One good point: They do present an almost readable summary of data bases. Buy and read different one, then return to this one and use it as a reference."
3,Its a Doccumentary About a Boxer NOT a Eros Original,"Perhaps one should never review a movie one knows anything about but I think the other reviewers may have gotten it a bit off when they mentioned erroticism. Its a movie about a realy good boxer. The talking about 'girls' may realy have been about the young females of the species. The other reviewers may have some issues with reality. Yes I actually watched it twice, my brother is in it. As a documentary it's a 3 but for entertainment its a zero... OK, So the French liked it a Cans; Does that make it gay?"
4,"Fascinating History of Laws, Land Ownership, Use, Food & Emigration","This is really a solid book - sort of a gateway book - it purports to be about the potato, but it's really about land tenancy laws, enclosure, the advent of crop rotation, population growth,famine, fuel costs, social history of home baking & the like. The chapter ""Women's Work"" could be an article to stand on its own. He even gets into discussion of the use of utensils, dishes & pots - and given the late adaptation of forks in the US, and the ongoing use of knives for eating in England - it's no wonder that my granddad, who was born in 1910 to English emigrants to who moved SW Pennsylvania to mine coal, perpetually vexed my grandmother with his ingrained habit of eating off his butter knife. He would always laugh and repeat the rhyme of ""I eat my peas with honey..."" before switching to a fork to please her.Fascinating issues raised - highly recommended."
2,Potato society,"The book spent too much time on the social effects and implications of the potato and the Irish Potato Famine, What about Poland, Germany and Russia? Multiple ""cultivars"" were mentioned but not explained, etc."
4,Nice activity book for travel,We bought this activity book for when we travel. It is pretty big with lots of pages to keep the kids busy during a long car or plane ride.
4,travel activity book,"overall, this is a good travel book for little ones because it has many different things that keep them involved."
2,"Great book, arrived too late.","The book is great, but be sure to order it at least two months before you travel. I ordered mine one month in advance, and received it only upon returning from our trip. Too bad; we'll store it until our next trip, or use it as a regular activity notebook."
2,Poor quality paper,The activities in this book look great but I was very disappointed to find that the paper is poor quality newsprint and markers will soak right through them. Not great because you can't use the activities on both sides of the pates.
3,"Nice, but nothing special!","We bought this for our 20 hour road trip, and it occupied the kids for a little while, but nothing special to occupy their time more than most other activity books. Nice ""Travel"" theme, but nothing that different."
4,Good book.,I like the book. They kids enjoy it. We go on road trips and these books are a must. Better than them watching movies all the time.
5,Superb,My children and students love the book and constantly ask for it! Provides endless fun and exciting activities for children of most ages!!
4,good for young children,"This is a good buy for young children. I was impressed with the variety. But many 8 year olds will find it too simple. For kids getting tired of coloring books, you might want to look into a Klutz book or something more exciting."
4,good variety,This kept my 5 and 7 year olds busy for part of a long car ride...nice selection of things to do.
5,Definitely worth it,"Ms. is the most important women's magazine out there because it's about women as a whole, and not just diets and makeup and how to please a man. It's national and global news and spreads awareness without ever talking down to the reader. You may not always agree with it (I take particular offense at a 1993 cover story perpetuating the ritual abuse scare ... and the fact that it seemed like every woman who wrote in had been a victim of ritual abuse, a statistical impossibility) but Ms. encourages dialogue and feedback. I find it unfortunate that a reviewer of this magazine had a bad experience with the editor-in-chief and I hope she wrote back and demanded an apology for being rudely dismissed. You'll want to hold onto your issues long after you've thrown away those issues of ""Jane."" It's that worth it."
3,Feminists Rule but Ms. needs an overhaul.,"Ms. was great when I was trying to find my feminist self. But now everytime I open it I feel like I am reading the same articles over and over again. Most of the writers seem to be older feminists nastolgic for the 60's. Not much in it to draw the younger third wave crowd.It is great that it is still around, but it needs to be brought into the new millenium.I gave it 3 stars because it has survived so long without selling out and sometimes it can still get me fired up about gender inequality. If you are new to feminism it is still worth a read."
4,Looks and feels nice,I put this on my daughter's bike. Looks and feels very good. I suspect you'd be able to clean it with Fantastic or something similar.
5,Great for the price.,"Really good tape if you are looking for a semi-glossy, medium-pebble vinyl tape. The padding isn't too thick, and the edges taper well, so a nice looking wrap is obtainable. The adhesive is very tacky, and there's plenty of strech.There's no finishing tape or pre-cut lever strips, and the plugs aren't too good, so you're really just buying bar tape. Looks great on my vintage bike."
4,Decent for the price,"I wanted an inexpensive wrap. This one was thinner than I had expected, but that is only on the edges and I do not know if this is typical or not. Once on the handlebar, it looks good and feels good. There was plenty for the application and, if wrapped properly, the thin edges overlap and are not at all apparent. Good value for the price."
5,A Most Interesting Book On WWII era War Crimes,"I didn't ""love the book (5-stars)"" but certainly appreciated the openess of the Japanese author pertaining to WWII Japanese war crimes with military and civilian prisoner mistreatment with extreme labor, torture, disgusting medical experimentations, and also battle field canabalisms. Highly recommend this book for those interested in the WWII dark side of human beings."
3,OK,"Interesting info, but author seems to try and make the point the Japanese did nothing worse than others have done thru out history."
1,The wider context matters,"It is important to record historical events accurately. It is also important to place and understand them in a wider context of the time.Japan was fighting one of the bloodiest wars in modern history against Western colonial powers in East Asia. She was trying to defend her interest in the region that had been so brutally conquered by the West. She was trying to liberate the region from many years of colonialism. She was also trying to replace the West as a new colonial master ...There is little doubt that many civilian lives were lost throughout East Asia. However to view Japan's action as an ""atrocity"" and/or a ""war crime"" is one-sided and misleading.It is true there could be a more open discussion of the war in Japan. However again we must remember that the US itself is only slowing coming to terms with its shameful past such as the genocide of Native Americans and the Africa-America slave trade."
1,Some true history but questionable,"This book gave me ideas of how the history is revised. Cannibalism is a custom of China; a lot of example of Chinese history have showed that they ate human whenever they lacked food. Civilians were the likely prey for the soldiers. Some Chinese eats worms, termites and even cockroaches.However, Japan has never had such custom or culture. Though the Japanese eats plants such as root or weed, they don't eat human in its history of 2600 years. They have a culture that they do Harakiri to kill themselves.I don't know why this apologist self-abuse the Japanese..."
3,A History that the Japanese will never Face,"This book can be rated as good by virtue of the fact that it is a Japanese Historian writing about the excesses his people committed in the name of the Emperor. For most Japanese WWII began and ended with Hiroshima & Nagasaki. Japanese often cite these twin events as the US moral equivolent to the Japanese soldiers chasing down men, women and children and killing them at the point of a bayonet, or watching them starve slowly to death. Most people in Japan (and I have lived there for over 10 years and read their literature on the subject in Japanese)still find it difficult to criticise their country.Kudos to Tanaka who was brave enough to write about a subject which can still bring around the boys in the blue vans (the ultra-rightists), and a knock on the door, or a bullet through the window in the middle of the night."
3,"Book Contains Great Facts, but Lame Excuses","The most outstanding attribute of this book is its honest depiction of Japan's atrocities. The description of these horrific onslaughts surpasses similar titles in some portions of the book.But the downside is the author's attempt to explain why the Japanese acted as they did, as if doing so will somehow make us view the Japanese army as something more than the monsters they were. Though Tanaka probaly doesn't mean to, he comes across as making excuses for the Japanese military's barbarism. Nevertheless, when he moves beyond fact description and into analysis, his intentions seem ambiguous at best. But overall, a good read."
1,Not again,"Just out of curiosity, I checked Morgan's other book and found that, yes, he has been reviewed by himself again. The review, generously bestowed by MortonJ is actually Morgan's father, Morton J. Rosenberg, who I doubt has read this tripe. Think perhaps MORGAN wrote this review? Morgan, you are one pathetic piece of work."
2,Entertaining but Unoriginal,"Even if the events are true, which seems doubtful, this book is a weak version of Ellis' American Psycho. The author steals from a wide variety of authors including Vonnegut and Ellis. He even steals from himself; several passages and scenes are repeated over and over.I did, however, find the author's blantant and not very subtle attempts to shock and manipulate the reader some-what entertaining.I would recommend this book, but only after reading American Psycho."
5,Vile and disgusting ... but I couldn't put it down,"This is the most vile, obscene, disgusting, racist, sexist, mysogynistic, politically incorrect, graphic book I've ever read ... and I could not put it down! I simply had to see what he would write next. Not for children ... but definitely for adults. This is pretty much assured to be the ""most controversial"" book of the decade ... think American Psycho but amplify it by 1000%."
4,Time of the End,This is a book of facts. Facts that keep you thinking long after you put the book down. It makes you look at your part in all of this - how it affects you and how you affect it. Lots of information in this book.
4,The author's view,"This book was written with a specific audience in mind: western Christians, especially Protestants, interested in the history and development of Christian worship. As the sub-title demonstrates, Christian worship developed out of Jewish worship practices, that were informed by the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, and were transformed by the early Christian church into the core of Christian worship. For most western Christians, and particularly Protestants (and both author's were raised as Protestants) this is a little known fact. Besides tracing the history and development of Christian worship, the book also contains a step-by-step commentary on the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the common Sunday morning service of the Orthodox churches. This book was written for ""the common person"", and does not require a theological background. It is straight forward and accessible."
2,Not nearly as good as you would expect.,"I bought this at a church book store and was horrified at how horrible it was. The authors speak about the Holy Trinity as developing like the outwards liturgical forms, confuse liturgical functions, and in one part he even places Emperor Saint Justinian the Great in the wrong century (the authors claim he lived in the 7th century when really he ruled in the 6th; 527-565). I would not recommend this book to anyone. Instead, I would recommend ""The Orthodox Liturgy: The Development of the Eucharistic Liturgy in the Byzantine Rite"" by Hugh Wybrew. I think that would be the best choice."
4,T3 Tourmaline Ceramic Wet-or-Dry Flat Iron,Love this! Hair is super shiny after use. Because I have fine/wavy hair I have had to put it on a higher heat setting than the directions suggest.
3,It was great until...,"This T3 flat iron worked great until the temperature dial broke. Then, when I try to return it to T3 Micro, I find out that neither Payless Beauty, nor Amazon.com are authorized resellers of the T3 product. All T3 Micro can do for me is sell me a new one! Payless has not responded to my email inquiry from a week ago, so I guess a bad review is my only recourse. All I can say is ""BUYER BEWARE""."
3,T3 Bespoke Labs flat iron,"I got a good deal on the T3; however, it does not even compare to my Hot Tools flat iron. The T3 is in storage."
1,Poor quality. No Warranty.,"You buy this product thinking you are obtaining a quality product, for the price. Then 6 months later, it stops working. Very disappointing. I have bought several other irons, hoping to find one that will last. I decided to spend extra and overpay for this one hoping it would be better. It states that there is a 4 year warranty. No there is not. They clearly state that they will NOT warranty any product from Amazon. So this has no warranty. Then even if you bought this product elsewhere, their warranty terms are so restrictive, you have to fill out forms in a certain number of days, and also pay an expensive handling fee. Sorry. that's useless. In th end, the unit simply stopped heating up, after only 6 months of use. And the manufacturer refused to stand behind their product. Just because I bought it at Amazon."
3,Just OK,"This product worked Ok. It rips your hair out quite a bit, but with the right product on your hair it does do the job. I was dissapointed with how cheaply made the product appears. The stickers on the side fell off one after the other during the very first use. I get better results by drying with a dryer and then finishing with a different iron, I've used the Chi and the Sedu and can would recommend either.I would consider your hair type before purchasing this item. It is best to dry with a dryer and then straighten. If you have difficult curly hair (thick or course) not ammendable to drying and then finishing a product like this may be a good solution to save time. I am returning this and will try a different model that isn't quite as cheaply made"
5,Love it!,Can't beat the price! This same iron at Sephora is $200. Love the iron. I've used it a couple times already. If anything changes I will update.
5,Outstanding,"The speed with which my order was delivered was amazing. The product was brand new and sealed...although it appears it may not be covered by the warranty because it was purchased through an Amazon seller (is this even legal??), I don't care, as the price savings made it a very good value even if it would need to be repaired or replaced at my own cost...and considering the reviews and good warranty, I don't expect I will have to use it."
3,A little disappointed,"My mom had a similar car when I was a kid. it is a fairly accurate reproduction, but the quality is just not there. It is not shoddy but very plain and lacking in detail."
5,"good product, great price",This was just what I needed and the price was much lower than I've paid for similar products in the past.
5,Great Socks!!,You can't go wrong with these socks. They are comfortable and keep their compression. Wash and wear - they don't shrink for lose their shape. They are a good value for a great price.I would recommend these socks to anyone.
3,I did not like them.,"I bought these because my Doctor recommended them. I did not like them. They were difficult to put on and take off. I could only wear them about 3 hours a day. Thank goodness my swollen feet and ankles became under control with medication so I was able not to wear them anymore. As usual, ordering from Amazon was a breeze!!"
4,"Jobst Medical Legware - Knee High, Closed Toe, X-Large","These compression stockings have given very good relief and are well worth the cost. Other compression stockings purchased in the past were not nearly as good, even though some were more expensive. I'd certainly purchase these Jobst stockings again in the future."
4,Love the Feel,"I think I might have ordered the wrong size, I mean they fit me comfortably when I first bought them, but know they slide down and scrunch around my ankles and at the end of the day, i have the scrunchy marks on my ankles. other than that, I love them. I guess I have to order the next size under."
4,tight,"this product is very tight and strong, so if you need moderate support pick another brand. Overall, the material is good."
3,Nice socks,These seemed very expensive when I bought them. They were for my mother in law who is 85 and is experiencing extreme swelling in her legs went through a battery of tests in the hospital and came up with no issues from the test results. We got her this pair and she has not complained yet. I asked her if she's been using them and she said she was.
1,not fit,it is not fit by size. i have exact the same at home by this size but my purchase is bigger than the same things which i have my house
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered Jobst Relief therapeutic knee high support stockings and I expected them to be a bit more sheer than they were. I returned them. I also used my Amazon points toward this purchase and since I have returned the stockings, I would like to get my points back."
1,not what I expected,I now use medium compression and wanted to get the next tighter. Did not notice these were thin. I will not wear these I think it was a waste of my money.
3,XL for who?,these must have been made for an extra large pigmy.I cannot keep these from sliding down my legs every few minutes. I do not recommend these unless you have short legs.
4,stocking,I think the stockings work very well. I need to bump it up to tighter ones. Im 40 and have veins. It is from standing on my feet all my life.
4,Ken's Review,Arrived early and in excellent condition..Just what I wanted and needed.recommend to anyone that needs support hose.
3,ugh,"the only thing I can say is that the devil himself must have invented these. They do not slide down on me, but they bind horribly at the ankles making life miserable."
1,Home Theater.,Not worth the money. The sound quality is little more than that provided by Sony Bravia TV.
2,So disappointed,"I'm so disappointed that the pronunciation of the phrase is not given which will make actually speaking the phrase nearly impossible! Additionally, I wish the phrases were a bit more basic and used in every day language. Some are a bit unusual. I was hoping this would help my children become familiar with the French language, but I'm now looking for something else."
4,Keep up on your French,Every day the calendar gives one a French phrase and its translation. I especially like the pronunciation guide in the upper left corner. I shall definitely know more French at the end of the year than I did at the beginning.
2,Living Language Calendar,Not as good as another brand because it does not provide phonetic sounds for all words
3,It was OK,"This Cd was ok, I was somewhat dissapointed, a screwed version of this CD would definetly be worth gettin, and there are quite a few classics on it. Number 7 is pretty dope."
2,Doesn't fit my seat post.,"Very nice round 3"" wide red reflector with a mounting bracket that doesn't fit anything on my bike. What the hell?? Seriously. WHY? What bike does this fit? 25.4mm clamp mount (about an inch). Pay attention to that before you buy. I should have. Get out your ruler and measure your seat post. Because I can tell you first hand it's possible to buy something made for a bike that won't come close to fitting a bike. I guess this is for a kids bike. Now I know."
4,reflector,Very simple to install. Very visible. Would have been five stars if the bracket had allowed me to install on a carrier versus just under the seat.
3,An Okay Book,"This book is just ok, don't rely much on it. There are many errors in the book. And it is really verbose. The book can at leat be cut by 1/3 if it were not so verbose."
2,"OK book, but very lacking in detail...","I got my CCIE a few years ago, so when asked I reviewed this book at the request of co-workers for content and validity. I was not impressed, as there are too many errors and verbose language. The book is OK to use as a rough guide, but I suggest if you buy this book you better also look at buying a few other books to fill in all the gaps. I think this book can assist in Lab Preparation, but you will need so much more..."
4,"Nice, but loose on the receiver","Installed this unit on my RV 2 inch receiver. It is easy to put together, takes about 10 minutes. It is a little loose on the receiver but some bungees help to keep it from flopping around. I needed a smaller size and this one does the trick. Has 3 holes so you can vary the distance that it sticks out from the back of your vehicle."
2,Not what was represented,"First of all the packaging arrived already opened. Bolts and nuts are missing. Most importantly, the platform was advertised as 20"" x 60"". The platform is actually only 45"". Off by 15"" is a lot!!Return shipping would be a ton, so am I stuck holding the bag for false advertising?"
1,"45"" wide, not 60"" as described","I saw another reviewer with the same issue, but figured other people would make the same complaint if it were the case. Yet it is: this is not a 60"" wide rack as described, its 45"" wide. Sadly my bag is 60"" wide and lacks the structural integrity to set on a smaller rack.So if you're okay with a 45"" wide rack or have no specific width requirements, its probably okay. Mine never made it out of the box, returned it immediately."
1,Garbage,Needed some marbles to go with my son's marble maze and bought these. Some of the marbles wont even roll because they are so pitted or were rolled in glitter. The wooden box looks like a child painted the decoration on it. It's obvious these are irregular marbles packaged up to get rid of and make money.Really disappointed with these!
2,Throw Backs,"Thankfully this was for my 5 year old that wanted nothing more than to just count and organize the marbles. Had he wanted to actually play the game we did these are absolute garbage. All of them are pitted, a few chipped and most dulled out. I guess ""specialty"" to this maker simply means buying all the throwbacks from the plant and selling them as ""special"" marbles. The box is very nice and looks very good, but the marbles are junk honestly."
3,ok,"The marbles were fantastic, and educational for hand eye cordination. But,four of the marbles were clear with absolutly no design. overall these marbles are fun and ok for the price."
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money on this Book!,"I bought this book in hope that I could find some interesting monologues I could use for theatre class and various auditions, but it was of no use! Most items in this book are in verse and are too short in length to be of much use to the average actor. Also, the range isn't overwhelmingly broad and the written text is poor. The different works all manage to present women in a similar and cliché way, somehow it is overly apparent that the ""collector"" of these pieces is a male. Some selections are interesting or by famous authors, however, they're out numbered greatly by B.S. wastes of ink and trees. I encourage anyone who is considering buying this book to keep looking because they don't deserve the disappointment I suffered after reading this collection. Good Luck in finding the ""perfect"" monologue (unless I'm auditioning against you, just kidding! ;) )!"
1,Horrible Support - Do not buy.,I have to say the same thing as the last review. I purchased the Sony projector 4 months ago. The bulb is only under warantee for 3 months. The first CS person told me it was covered and to take it in to a depot. Then I was told it wasn't covered by the depot but that I could purchase it for $450 plus the labour of $150 to install a bulb that can't take them more then 5 minutes.I have gone back and forth with Sony support for 4 weeks. And they are now saying they'll give me a discount but the discount is based on getting it fixed at the depot and I'll get sony gift certificates back.I have purchased a lot of Sony stuff in my life but I will never buy anything again. I was so disappointed with support on this product that I would never have bought one given the choice.It is very good quality but the cost of ownership is just too ridiculous.I can't stress enough that there are many other great products out there. Go with one that has good support.
1,Paperback version does NOT have color pictures,"The story is beautiful, but the paperback version does not have the gorgeous color pictures of the hardcover version! This is one of the main reasons my kids loved this book- the pictures. Spend the money and get the hardcover with the pictures. The black and white version just doesn't cut it."
3,A classic book but the beauty is gone.,"I grew up with my mother reading this to us, it was her favorite book. So you can imagine how thrilled I was when I found that it had returned to print. However, despite the prompt shipping and well handled packaging I opened it to find that the beautiful pictures I'd loved were very poor black and white photo copies of the originals by Mercer Mayer. The sad thing is that had the book been under $5 I would have expected the lack of color prints. However there are many other fine books that are for the same price with the full color images. I am sorely disappointed in Four Winds Press for taking the beauty out of the art of this book."
4,"Great book, but NOT a hardcover",I saw this book listed as hardcover and bought it to replace our dog-eared paperback version. The version I received is the same beautifully illustrated story with a wonderful theme. It is also the same flimsy paperback.
2,One of the poorest quality children books i have seen,"Really, the paper quality, the quality of images, the quality of the composition- what is going on?! Just not worth the trouble of ordering, let alone the ridiculously high price. The 2nd star is only for the basic story, but this publication does not deserve it."
1,Not the same as the original edition.,This edition is printed in small framed black and white. It's like reading a photo copy of the original. Very disappointing.
2,NOT WHAT I REMEMBER,"When I was a librarian many years ago, I remember this book as being very well illustrated. I think it was a hardbound edition. The paperback edition I purchased recently has VERY BAD QUALITY reproductions of the artwork. (The art is good but the reproduction bad). ALA"
3,Not the quality it should have been,"I feel totally deceived in purchasing this book. First, it's a wonderful story that I read to my children. Second, the book I read to my children was full beautiful color. Third, I purchased the book from Amazon for my grandchildren, only to find it's a cheap reproduction with poorly illustrated b/w images instead of the full color of the original. It could have been made on a school copier. For the $9.99 price, it's a ripoff for this version. If anyone from Amazon has a heart they'd not only refund the money I spent, but also to send the original in full color. NOW. IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS."
2,cheap knockoff,"I also ordered this book as soon as I saw that it was available. It has been out-of-print for many years and was a childhood favorite of mine. I received the book and was greatly disappointed to see that it was a very small, bootleg-type printing. The quality is so poor that you can barely appreciate the beautiful illustrations. I was saddened and disappointed by the false advertising."
5,Christmas Gift. Kids love it.,This was a Christmas gift for the kids. They love it just as they have all the DDR games

4,So much fun,This game is so much fun. You don't have to unlock songs (hint go to all songs.) even though im not that good at this game in basic i still go on basic. once in a while i fall but nothing bad happens. some songs are really hard on basic like dancedance. i fail everytime. but some songs are easy like funky town. other songs aren't to hard like since u've been gone. so what im saying is it takes practice. on basic and up you cant stay in the middle it has to be like you're walking on the mat. it gets frusterating i cant lie and somtimes when im play for a while when i'm done one of my ankles hurt alot. But after awhile i get btter. well i think i said enough. so if you are willing to move and get ready for a challenge buy it and you wont be dissopointed. well atleast i wasnt.
5,DDR,"I love this game, like all other DDR titles. I haven't noticed any repeat songs from other DDR games like the first reviewer said, but I do have more songs to unlock, so that may change.With this game, like DDR Extreme, you can go online and play against others. The graphics are more 3D, and the characters don't look as ""boxy"". There is an easier beginner level than previously and the tutorial is voice guided. There are 70 songs total and some of the licensed tracks include Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, Let's Dance, Heaven is a Place on Earth, Since You've Been Gone, Centerfold, Come Clean, Funky Town, Jerk it Out, Video Killed the Radio Star....a good mix of different types of music and great for the 80's lover. ;)"
3,Maybe to advanced for me,I guess I should start with more basic verisons of DDR.I couldn't keep up with the Supernova even on beginner level.And sometimes I get tired of the same songs over and over.
2,Didn't work,"The back of the disc was severely damaged and was not read by my playstation two. luckily for me, i found my previous Dance Dance Revolution supernova and therefore did not need this copy. the price of this purchase is what made me go for it but overall disappointed in the quality of the disk i received"
3,I'm sure this has been said 100 times,"This was a replacement of the original DVD which had somehow gotten pitted? Not sure how that happened, but we enjoy the workout and the friendly competition (me and wife). We had purchased another game system and hadn't played in quite awhile, so were really disappointed when original disk showed unusual pitting when we tried to load it. I debated for awhile about buying the ""Just Dance"" game for our other game system, but decided to stick with DDR because it was familiar.The main thing I don't like, and I've seen this so many time's it's hardly worth mentioning, is: The songs are mostly stuff from China, or Japan, or some foreign country that I've never heard anywhere else except on the DDR game.I suppose if Konami makes the ""Just Dance"" game, it would be the same, no matter what gaming system You have.It's still a lot of fun, and a good workout."
4,"If you want something to move too, this is for you!","Great game, with a great selection of music and different areasof the game for things like a workout or just a short song or too. Great for 2 players."
5,DDR Supernova,This game is a great product to buy to bring people together and have a couple laughs. It is deffinetly easier for teenagers to understand how to use it than adults. The song selection is decent. It takes a while to understand all this game has to offer. You have to play around with it and search all the options.Hope this helped ;)
4,Good but not the best DDR,"I just got this game and although it is very fun I was a little dissappointed. I have been playing DDR Max 2 for several months and wanted a change so I picked up supernova, it's fun but I passed about half the songs on difficult on the first try, expert is going to take some time because it's a huge step in difficulty from difficult to expert. DDR Max 2 seems to be more about speed and supernova is slower and (atleast on expert) seems to be more about difficult timing steps.I still recommend it but only gave it 4 stars because I prefer DDR Max 2."
4,DDR for a new generation!,"DDR has certainly changed over the years. With the latest installment (Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova) one can see the change dramatically. Stellar Dance Mode is for most a complete waste of time as it requires us to play songs we do not want to and in modes we do not want to just to unlock songs in the game. Some of the licensed songs are remixed versions that are below par to the original versions while other licensed songs are thrown on here just because they are already in other bemani games (Karaoke Revolution, Beatmania USA). There are many Japanese songs on this mix as well as instrumentals that seem out of place in DDR.We get songs from the arcade version (not the best ones in my opinion) and some new licenses (some which came out of nowhere it seems)but the feel of DDR has totally changed now and I miss what it used to be.The Double steps are quite good in this game."
5,Awesome fun,"This is a great way to have fun and loose weight without even trying to hard. I have lost 10 lbs just doing 15 songs a day for 2 weeks, not bad!!!I would recommend this for anyone who would like to get in shape very easily. My daughter and I compete to get the highest score and we are both loosing extra winter lbs to boot!"
3,disappointment,"I have been playing DDR Extreme 2 for almost a year as a form of exercise. I was excited to hear that a new title, DDR Supernova, was coming out, and I preordered it. I am really quite disappointed in the game. I hate the method of unlocking songs, it doesn't seem to make any sense, and I am not an idiot. The Workout Mode is lousy, the menu is not intuitive and I can't set it the way I want. Some of the new songs are great, but since I can't seem to unlock any new ones I am pretty frustrated. I had no problem unlocking songs etc. with the previous version I own."
4,Okay,"A couple of really good songs, but mostly just crap. Unlock mode is really, really, really confusing, so you basically have the same songs the whole time unless you want to spend 5 or 6 hours playing beginner songs in ""Stellar Master mode."" It starts you out with about 6 or 7 good songs, and the rest are really just mediocre. Great step patterns. Recommend buying in the groove or an older version, instead of this. Over-priced and just alright, overall."
5,This album will tear you apart!!!,"Alright this album is heavy as hell, and it's just plain terrifiying! In a good way! The vocalist has an amazing deep, gutteral, and sometimes gurgly growl that makes you want to cower! Or be like me and growl along with him!!! The bass here is amazing it's extremely crushing and dare I say it? Groovy.This album is a must, you must have it. If you don't have it-expecially at these prices-than you my good sir are a moron! This is probably one of my favorite CDs. Deffinatly a must if you need to take out some unneeded anger and frustration!"
5,Great new band !,"This is a great new grindcore band bringing along new sounds and topnoch lirycs but not only are they from my ex hometown but they have the best drummer ! Scarculture's "" inscribe"" is worth every doller you got and more, hehe. I don't realy got a best track here but i sure love ""keep it to myself"" very awsome track ! Peace !!"
5,Grindcore at it's finest right here !,"To all of you out there, who loves grindcore and support top bands like ""origin"" , ""dyingfetus "" , and , ""napalmdeath"" i definaly recommend this fantastic disc called inscribe by scar-culture because it shows just how much grindcore is alive and should be respected by the deathmetal community and blackmetal community heck even hardcore and metalcore community all in one! Not only is this a well done album but also very original with riffs that would make your girlfriend orgasm hehe !!! I always have to say my fav song and that would have to be mmm maiby ""Keep it to myself"" ? Yes i pick that track as a personal favorite! Tchau !"
5,Heavy !!!,"Man, this band ""scar culture"" is sure one heavy band. I just purchase this album and i do have to admit it is not disapointing at all... Not to mention awsome lirycs !! Grind-core is here to stay people ! Scar culture is defenly one of the heaviset bands after ""origin"" , ""suffocation"" and ""napalm death"". Buy it !"
4,Music Themed letterhead,"This letterhead is great! I use it to make end-of-the-year awards for my elementary chorus members. The shipping is a bit high, but as I could no longer find it at Office Max (where I used to purchase it) I had to suck it up.Masterpiece Sheet Music Letterhead - 8.5 x 11 - 100 Sheets"
3,Practical yet uninteresting,"I am a Masters of Human Resource Management Student at Rutgers, and I felt that the book was very practical and could be used as a great reference guide, and I suppose that for what the book was written. However the writing was so commonplace, uneventful, and repetitive I found myself skipping paragraphs, furthermore, I felt that the case studies were not good examples of the points the book was trying to make."
3,"Good themes, repetitive writing","This book is a bit frustrating for me. It has a lot of great themes and concepts regarding teamwork, but very few concrete examples or applications. It gets a little repetitive in how it addresses each topic. It was required reading for a class I took, but otherwise I would not ever buy/read it."
1,Incredibly boring,"This tape should win the award for most boring tape ever published. I listen to tapes in my car on a regular basis, and out of hundreds, or maybe thousands of tapes this was by far the most boring. It's read in a monotonous voice without fun or interesting examples. Don't listen to it in your car - you are likely to fall asleep behind the wheel. Regrettably, I cannot rate the contents because the substance never registered in my brain."
1,Complete waste of time,"This book is a complete waste of time. In 40+ years I have never seen a published piece of work that is this poorly written. There is no way you can draw any conclusion about team effectiveness from the disjointed, incomplete cases prsented. Before these authors create another disaster I would recommend that they take a basic writing course. The book would only been midly anoying had the author understood how to form a basic english sentence.My recommendation - rather than buy this book just throw your money in the garbage."
3,Feels very fake at times,"I'm reading this book for a class, and from the very beginning I get the feeling that the authors are just saying what they are ""supposed to say."" It is very generic and even though it is not supposed to be an exciting read it is very hard to concentrate through the long stories."
3,The Wisdom of Teams,"As a professional consultant, time is well spent with the author is states clearly what he means, and justifies his stand. Good relevant information, and easy reading.Dr. Evelyn J. Johnson"
3,OK,This gadget seems to work somewhat ok. Please note that this isn't a regular compressed air cannister - you pump it up and it can spray a little bit; I think it's meant for light painting or something.
1,an abomination,"Why, oh why put out this muzak inspired POS? The originals were so much better. Please release the original tracks and let this man rest in peace."
5,a great book to read in your spare time,"this book is really great. i bought it because it has many pictures, it is very detailed, and it shows how difficult one day could be for the great Tony Hawk.Tony is a big inspiration to many people including me. So, if your child wants to read something that shows how much work they should put into a day, they should read this book and see how much Tony works for people every day. Anyone who likes skateboarding should buy this book."
2,These measure about three inches square. Very small.,"Everything in the photo is included, but they are a mini set, the paper folds into tiny little envelopes the size of the cards that come with floral arrangements. Nice set, good examples in the book, but not really what you would be expecting."
3,Lurid tale,Very lurid tale. 50's cheesiest at its best. John Russell [later of Lawman fame... quite a shift in gears!] at his slimiest. Long story short... the bad guy gets his just desserts in the end ;o)
5,Really good campaing expansion,"This book tell you all history about the success that destoyed Myth Drannor, but you'll need to have Arcane Age Boxed set (Netheril), to transport your Players into the past, otherwise, this book make well for ancient history proficency."
2,"okay reference, limited adventure","Less a module and more a description of the various battles surrounding the title event. If you are looking for an *adventure* to run or modify, you won't find it here, and I strongly recommend just cooking one up yourself. As a reference, it is okay, but isn't really detailed enough to justify buying it."
5,Caillou the Explorer,I received this video as a gift (?? before the release date??). My son (3 yrs) loved it! He wants to watch it over and over and over..... Highly recommend!
1,He's a brat,"I have let my daughter watch this, but I always say things to her like ""I'm glad you don't act like that"". He is the biggest brat on tv, whiney and short-tempered."
1,"Annoying, Self-Centered, Bald Pain in the Neck","If this is what you want for your kids, knock yourself out. If they don't whine and complain incessantly now they sure will after a few viewings. Caillou(even his name is irritating) also consistently defies the wishes of his parents and is very disobedient. Great message for young children."
2,Mixed Emotions,"This series could be so much better than it is - I have to say Caillou is pretty whiney. Also - why does he have no hair? He looks like one of those poor kids w/cancer. Also - lastly, what kind of name is Caillou?? Anyway, my little three-year old loves Caillou but i wish they would make him less WHINEY. I love that everything (including the kitchen sink) is in primary colors."
4,Blue Thunder swerves just short of the finish,"Well researched and eye opening, Blue Thunder, perhaps in an attempt to appear too responsible pulls its punches or fails to see the big picture. Briefly Don Aronow, speedboat racer and manufacturer, was a good friend of then Vice-President but running for President George Bush who helped Aronow get the Customs contract for drug interdiction ""Blue Thunder"" Speedboats. He ended up murdered gangland style just prior to his being called to testify before a federal grand jury, a fact no one outside of the federal government could have known. Curiously, Aronow was also partners with Donnie Soffer (employer of Donna Rice of Gary Hart fame and the ill-fated ""Monkey Business"" yacht) as well as Ben Kramer, drug smuggler and nephew of Meyer Lansky. Something rotten in Miami? You bet your Janet Reno. R. Roy Blake 14200 First Avenue South #202, Burien, WA 98168"
4,Great fun for toddlers,"I got this book for my 2 yr old daughter for Christmas and we've been having so much fun with it. Some of the pompom pieces are very small, but I just make sure she does not handle them. The glue is amazingly strong after it's all dry. We've purchased additional pompoms, eyes and glue because she used them all in a few days of receiving the book."
4,"Good reference, but requires supplementary volumes","This is a good book to get started with machinery analysis, but be careful since it leaves many of the detailed analyses and remediation techniques to Mr. Wowk's other books. For example, the Amazon publisher's review erroneously indicates that this book contains the procedure for strobe-less 4-trial balancing. It does NOT - that procedure is in Mr. Wowk's follow-on book on Balancing. But as a SET of books Mr. Wowk's texts seem very thorough and up-to-date."
5,the perfect companion,This book is great. The maps are very user freindly. It is a must read before we head out for our weekend day hikes.
5,"gerbil tested, gerbil approved",Love the odor absorption and the fact that it is not very dusty. My gerbils love to burrow in it and it has replaced other bedding choices. Pleasantly surprised by how much it expands once you break it up from the package... this bedding will last you a long time. Nice purple color :)
2,Too many errors,"This book is ambitious in its scope. However it is near abysmal in its editing. There are dozens of errors in the equations and some in the text. Derivations were not checked with original sources and so contain assumptions that are not valid in all cases. As an overall introduction to optical materials this book is OK, but don't rely on it for equations if your job (or your grade) depends on it."
4,Keeps hands busy!,"I bought this product for my child that struggles with fine motor skills.....he didn't take to it but my other children LOVED the peel and stick pictures. I bought a second box just to have on those rainy, stuck indoors, kind of day!"
5,Lots of Fun!,"My 4 1/2 year old daughter received these as a Christmas gift, and she loves them! The pieces are tiny, but she doesn't have a hard time at all with them. It's great for her fine motor skills, and she's excited about the final product. I will buy more in the future!"
3,"Great print, very thick though.","The comforter set was thicker/warmer than I expected. The print is gorgeous and the quality is okay (basic Target quality), but it's really thick, so not a good comforter if you are using anything else. Also, you can't really clean it (other than spot cleaning), so you'd have to use other blankets with it and this would be way too many covers."
2,Woods of Windsor,"I returned this product. The amazon web was misleading. My intent was to order the hand and nail creme but when I clicked on a bigger size of the product, this body lotion was the option. This is not a larger size of the hand and nail lotion (which I wanted ). It was annoying and could have been cleared up with a little better care on the website."
1,Peg Bundy wig,"I purchased this wig for a Peg Bundy costume. Arrived on time, but I was unhappy with how messy the wig was. Ended up purchasing another one elsewhere."
3,Auburn Teaser Wig,My only complaint about the wig is that the curls were not well formed so there are strands of hair that are really curly and others that are almost straight. This is fine for a one time use.
1,Nothing like the picture.,I bought this for a Peg Bundy costume and it looked nothing like the picture displayed. It was longer and looked more like a crazy afro. And you couldn't calm it down are try to replicate the picture by combing it because it just made it frizzier. I do not recommend this wig if you want one that looks like the picture.
2,Not good as a stand alone text,"I liked this book and I hated this book. If I were reading this book for my own enjoyment or in conjunction with a more formal text then it is an interesting and informaive read...even enjoyable at times. If you are in a class that uses it as the sole text then you will have to rely on the professor to fill in the blanks which may be a bad thing as it was in my case. I had the version with the green cover and it's contents are totally in black and white, the graphics are horrible in many cases and do not reproduce well if making copies. Not a good text for a course but a great book for personal enjoyment."
2,Lady Delafont's Dilemma,"I was really disappointed with this book. I had enjoyed the first book so much and was really looking forward to reading Lady Delafont's story. What a letdown! I know that married couples can grow estranged because of a lack of communication, but this story was a bit of much. Did none of the more sympathetic relatives/friends never think of stepping in and shaking this couple (esp the husband). The only justification I can find for this story is that it seems to serve as a conduit to the next installment. Lady May, a character that crops quite prominently in the first two novels, is I believe to be the main character in the next book. And as she has proved to be a more interesting character than Lady Delafont, I will probably wait to read the next book, and hope that the story is worthy of the lady."
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK,"I really enjoyed Donna Simpson's follow up book, Lady Delafont's Dilemma. The characters were real and believable, not shallow and too perfect like some romances I have read. I especially enjoyed the ways the plot developed into a mystery surrounding the strange young Frenchman. (I don't want to let out any secrets). I found that I couldn't put this novel down. I had to keep reading to see what happened next. The storyline was excellent and portrayed how a misunderstanding could break up even a loving couple but also how love could overcome this in the end. I have been an avid reader for 40 years and would recommend this novel. It has become a permenant addition to my bookshelves. Lord st. Claire's Angel, the first novel, was also excellent and is on my shelf as well. Bravo to Donna Simpson! Keep writing your wonderful books...I am looking forward to the next one. Sincerely- a fan from Ontario, Canada"
1,WHAT A LETDOWN!,"I bought this book on the strength of the first book. I enjoyed the first book very much but this book was very disappointing. The plot was extremely weak; it was the basis of the misunderstanding. How could this misunderstanding drive a couple apart who claims to be so much in love and serve as an obstacle for such a long time? Five years. Anyway, I didn't enjoy it much. I only hope the next one is more realistic."
1,0 stars if possible,"While it seems that most romance novels, especially regencies, have one or two misunderstandings in the book to keep the central romantic couple apart, this book was just unending with the misunderstanding. For a couple to be so in love and not even discuss the situation in some fashion was just plain silly. And as a reader, very frustrating. And why did not any of the other people milling around in the story step in? It just did not work. Page after page it just baffled me that they were separated and for what? It just turned me off to the whole story."
5,Met expectations - good for beginners,"If you're starting out with this as a new hobby, this is a great choice since the low price removes the barrier and excuse not to buy it. The piece is sturdy and comes with a plastic cover and basic instructions. Happy I began learning with this."
5,Great starter harp - but not a toy,"A new harmonica player, I was looking for something durable to learn on and take with me. My Blues Harp just seemed to nice to cart around everywhere, and as a novice, I worried about unintentionally mistreating it. The pocket pal plays nice and is comfortable to play. I can try different things without too much concern for damaging it. I've been blowing it pretty hard for several weeks without any signs of blowing it out of tune or having any sticking reeds. Very similar to American Ace, Great Little Harp, Hot Metal and Blues Band. I like this one best of those, probably Blue Band next. They all play well for starter harps."
2,dont buy this!,"this is not durable at all, I had used it for a month and couldnt use more at all, the first two holes of the harmonica are broken and do not give a good sound at all, so then I need to switch to another typedo not recommend!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I am not a very experienced harmonica player, but it was easy to hear the poor quality of sound this instrument produces. This harmonica lets out a good deal of air. I am not impressed. At least the price tag should give you an idea of what it is you are getting."
5,Music Daddy,Wanted to give my daughter a different kind if instrument. She loves it and it encourages her to entertain and learn songs.Product arrived on time and as described.
5,Hohner 80 Pocket Pal Diatonic Harmonica,Gift for my 2-year old grandson. He's so cute. He really gets into it.
2,Broken reed after 2 days,"I was excited to get this and learn to play the harmonica. I got it, it sounded pretty good but I'm a newbie so what do I actually know? The notes sounded right anyway! But after 2 days one of the draw reeds is broken/bent/whatever and I can't use it now. I guess I got what I paid for, but really even a cheap $1 harmonica would have worked longer than this. Disappointing."
4,Decent harmonica for the price,"Yes, there are much better harmonica out there. But there are also worse! This is not necessarily the best or the most durable. I have been using it for almost everyday for the past month. It is still going strong. At times, it seems not to make the appropriate sound, especially with drawing in a breathe. But, for the most part, it was 'operator-error'. You have to be over the hole to make the correct sound.It is cheap enough that if there is problems with it in the next few months, you can replace it. The sound is not as good as the Hohner Marine Band. But the price is only a fraction of the better harmonica."
1,Unbearable and ridiculous.,"Oh, how precious, another-little-film-that-could! Except, this couldn't, and shouldn't. I got about 30 minutes into this cheese-fest and changed channels. One of the first characters that's introduced to us drove me up the wall nearly instantaneously -- the personification of quirky, donning her h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s oh-so-silly hat and $3.99 Wallmart platform flip-flop, if I ran into on the street I would run in the other direction as fast as possible. Other unbelievable and irritating characters quickly follow.The storytelling folksy music, some of the worst dialogue ever committed to screen, acting which veers from average to laughably bad, and characters that ring untrue, this is an absurd movie and worth skipping."
4,"Thoughtful with interesting, sympathetic characters","What happens when you title a movie ""Mind the Gap"" and lead the credits with Alan King? Few people under seventy become interested. But this is a great movie about life, relationships, and ""the gap"".Jill Souble is darn cute, and the overall acting good to great. King did his usual pro job too."
4,touching and well-written,"The novel, Red Earth and Pouring Rain, although not a fast read, is well worth reading. The novel takes a unique view at the post-adolescent world of a college student, his primate counterpart, and the life of an 18th Century man as well.Although a little hard to follow at times, this novel was quite enjoyable and puts a new spin on this genre of reading."
2,"Imaginative and challenging, but fails in delivery.","Vikram Chandra's tale of mythic India weaved in with modern times is a very imaginative, epic tale , but it turns out to be too long-winded, rambling at times and unresolved in my view. He switches back and forth from the past to the present rather well, although, at times, I thought that maybe if you separated the times, they, in themselves, would have been very good books. The story on the whole lacked cohesiveness. It seemed that Chandra kept writing more and more without staying focused on the story at hand. There was too much to digest which didn't leave too much thought to savor. What I really disliked, however, was the latter part of the book where it didn't make sense with the bloodthirsty doctor and the bomb. I felt very disappointed."
2,An overly bloated and all too complex first novel,I much prefer Midnight's Children to this bloated text. I could barely read through the whole text and longed for an editor to weed out much of the excess.
1,Love the cover and recycle the remainder.,"Love the cover and recycle the remainder. A lovely printed book. Bad story, bad language, bad metaphors."
1,Passion? Yes... Character development? No.,"I started reading this book with enthusiasm. I was looking for a good summer read, an escape, something to dive into at the end of a long day at work. At first, it seemed that this would be just the ticket: colorful characters, interesting culture, history, and a novel premise... But it never got off the ground. I found myself turning pages just to try to get through them.I found the characters to have little depth and no matter how hard I tried, I found myself unable to empathize with them or care about what they were doing. The dialog is contrived. The stories--and there are lots of them--are diatribes. Two-dimensional characters + long, boring stories = an uninteresting book.I am a bit surprised by all the praise this book has received. Seems too congradulatory for something so unimpressive."
4,It's easy to get lost...,"I disagree with the reviewers who complain of the stylistic changes and seeming randomness of the novel. The way in which the stories change and dive into each other is reminiscent of the Mahabharata in that the epic style is mimiced here. The stories are not switching linearly but instead are stacked on top of each other.All the same, it is a first novel, and was a bit long. While I think it had many beautiful moments, I thought the framing story needed some bolstering, perhaps at the expense of some of the longer middle sections. But again, I think it's a valuable contribution to the collection of Indian writing, especially since it incorporates the experiences of Indians who have grown up in the United States, or who went to college here."
4,Comedy! Tragedy! Angst!,"Vikram Chandra has taken what he acknowledges at some point in this book to be the essential formula for a Bollywood film (something for everyone) and turned it into a thoroughly enjoyable, intelligent novel. It really isn't hard to keep the different frames in mind, and it is enjoyable to come across familiar friends after a few chapters spent in the company of another tale."
2,very disappointing,"I started this book after reading so many fabulous things about it. But after struggling through all its immense rambling length, I have no clue what the whole point was. The initial premise of stories within stories was novel and arresting. But I found the awkward jumping from past to present very jarring. It might have made the novel more cohesive if Chandra had stuck to the medieval India stories and not tried to work in the American experiences. The events that lead to the end with the mad doctor just came out of nowhere and I didn't get the sense that this novel was being led to its logical conclusion. All in all, very disappointing!"
2,The problem with multiple storylines,"The sentences in this book are beautiful, the paragraphs dense and packed with expression, and the chapters long and self-contained...With all this, the novel manages to be an utter failure. There are two major problems. First, the main plot line of the novel, the story being told, is rambling and long-winded, stylistically correct, and fantastically dull. I wanted to give up that part of the book, and only read the more contemporary of the storylines, which moves at a faster clip. The issue is that the more contemporary of the storylines (which is only adequate) is maybe 30% of the novel...when 70% of the novel is boring you to tears, that's bad enough. Second, the characters are forgettable. I would use more damning language, but they're not worth it..just forgettable. There's no defining characteristic, ZERO personality, and no life. So, it's a tremendously well written book, but a complete waste of time."
3,This got confusing quick,"I was a casual reader trying to finally understand the fundementals of how assembly worked and how it related to machine/binary. It started on it, then launched into VERY specific items that was over my head. You need to understand C and have a grasp of other basics before picking this up."
2,Confusing & loaded with errors,I am taking an Assembly class and I find this book frustrating at times due to lack of explanations and details in its steps. I have always had to Google to help with the material. This books contains a lot of errors which don't help either.
4,Nice addition to my stained glass box,I made a stained glass jewelry box for my cousin and used this movement inside. She loves turning it and hearing the music. Good purchase for price!
5,this is a great cd!,"look mr. im a 21 year old senior in college.this was a great cd. imena the thing is labeled rock/pop. so of course this has some pop sounds to it. and the reason why drake doesnt have songs like ""somehow"" and ""telegraph"" is because those 2 songs are amazing but its you know...sad songs. i love sad songs but drake says in a million interviews that ""Its only time"" is a happier cd where almost every song is fun and happy, because of the fact of his car accident a year ago where he got seriosly hurt and so now he thinks every morning that hes happy to be alive so thats the explananiton on why this cd is very happy. so overall this is a great cd.and i recommend it to everyone!"
1,Not meant for his younger fans to listen too.,"My daughter is a huge Drake and Josh fan but this cd is really not meant for kids her age, she is 7. The first song on the cd ""Up Periscope"" has lyrics that I won't even let my teenager listen too. It's really upsetting for me because she could not wait till christmas to get this and it was a big disappointment. We will not be buying any other cd's he releases."
1,Not for Kids-suggestive lyrics-disappointed,"I am a 45 yr old mom that enjoys watching Drake and Josh with my 16 ,13, 9 and 5 yr old children. My 13 yr old daughter has been waiting for this cd to come out...we were so disappointed when she started reading the lyrics to the first song that was ""suggestive"" of him sleeping with someone and waking up next to them. I wasnt expecting something like this since he is still considered a Nickolodeon star. I thought he would be more mindful of his audience and not have songs with lyrics youth shouldnt be singing. All the songs on his show are fine. My daughter also read me some lyrics that have ... in place of words. We dont listen to profanity and I dont want me or my children singing songs (no matter how ""catchy"" they sound)about being immoral or with profanity.I gave my daughter the money she spent on it and we are throwing this away.We will be more careful to look the lyrics up online since you cant take cd's back once they've been opened."
4,Nice album,"I bought this album for my 7 year-old daughter, since she's a fan of the show Drake & Josh. But I always find myself enjoying the music when she has it on. I was sure his hit song from the show would be the only decent song on the album, but his songs are consistently good - a pleasant surprise.Really, when I hear it, I hear some influence from early Beetles, but also a lot from Billy Joel."
4,drake bell-music!!,"I ordered this for my daughter who is 6, and loves Drake Bell from his tv show. She really likes music and loves to sing along to all of his songs. But the surprising part is how good it really is. The music is fun and I like it too, I always tend to be into music that is written by the artist, and respect that.Drake Bell is a talented musician and I hope he reaches a wider audience!"
4,Surprisingly mature work,"I'm WAY older than the target Drake Bell audience, but I was impressed with this CD. Drake Bell must have taken a stand against his record company to get this CD made---who would have thought the guy from ""Drake and Josh"" would create a Beatles-influenced power pop record? The Beatles influence is a bit too obvious sometimes, but ""Rusted Silhouette"" works. I think this guy, if he manages to stick it out, is capable of really important work in the future."
2,Way different than his first disc.,"I bought this cd for my son, who really likes Drake Bell's music. He loved his first cd, but this effort was so different from the first style, my son didn't really care for it. It kind of has a retro, Beatles-esque (think Yellow Submarine) vibe. You'll like it if you're into that style."
3,Better than one would expect?,"My kids like the show and I have to admit I have watched it with them on more than one occasion.This cd, other than the theme song, has nothing really to do with the show.That's a good thing as the show is definitely much more juvenile in nature and Bell's music talents far outweigh his acting ones.That said, this cd is very busy, as though Bell tried too hard to distance himself from the character of the tv show and prove his worth as a musician/singer/songwriter.He(and/or his songwriting team)is/are obviously influenced by Jellyfish, Michael Penn,Jon Brion and others.However, this cd lacks the depth and brilliance of these other artists and never really seems to hit on all cylinders.Many of the songs have too similar arrangements,styles and personas (with one or two exceptions)to be a diverse album, making the cd a bit one- dimensional.Still a good,not great effort, and better than alot of the garbage(not the band) out there.Give it a listen."
2,"Lightweight, adds little to our understanding","A little bit of self indulgent fluff, easily read in an afternoon. Phil's motives for writing this book, other than my coughing up the bucks, can be discerned nowhere in this desultory run through of the band's history.McNally's book covers all this ground in more detail and with some insight and perspective."
1,"""Searching for the Sound: My life with the Grateful Dead""","Lesh's book is a pedantic missive. The author is clever, however, in disguising his pain. The style is an easy read, but that should not be a testament to any endorsement of a Pulitzer.Lesh would be better off writing a book on music theory. Saddly, he has nothing new to contribute to our knowledge, nor any wisdom one might expect from a mind expanding lifetime. Unless you are a librarian or independently wealthy, I do not recommend this book."
3,Kindle Edition Has No Pictures,"I liked the book! But where are the photographs? Would have added so much ... In the credits it references photos, but they did not make it into the Kindle edition. Weak!"
4,Another great one by Ms. Dunwich.,"This is the second Gerina Dunwich book I have read. My first was The Wicca Spellbook, and it was the book that started me on this path. This book contains a lot of great information as well as some spells and rituals.Very nice.Blessed Be!"
4,Very informative.,This book tells the history story of the craft. It gives a lot of background information that would be helpful to anyone new in the craft. I recommend this book as it will always be a good reference book for me. It covers a lot of material and is very informative.
4,a different type of wicca book,"ms. dunwich's book is very different than most wiccan books,i really enjoyed it however, i dont think it is the best book for the beginner because it doesnt tell very much,but once you got the basics of wicca down this is a good book."
3,Ok,"This is my first book from the author and I have found some things that bug me about it. For example, when she shows symbols, she shows the pentagram pointing down. Many of you know that a inverted pentagram is Satanic and has nothing to do with Wicca. But overall, it was alright."
5,One of Regardie's greatest collections,"These essays will give you a great foundation in both magickal theory and practice. The final essay ""The Art of True Healing"" has been published as a separate book in itself and gives a complete explanation of his middle pillar ritual as well as practical uses for it. The Qabala articles are great as a quick jump start into theory. If you want to buy one Regardie book, this is it."
