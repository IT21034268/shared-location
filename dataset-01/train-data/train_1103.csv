1,horrible,he should have stayed in the rocky horror picture show.his voice is really really badd.the songs and music are long winded and have no meaning.his music is meatless.
5,Meatloaf is awesome,I have been a meatload fan for years. Recently I got an updated version on my computer for music and realized all the CD's of his that I was missing. So of course I ordered every one of them. The best of gave a good selection of his various album selections. He has so many good songs it would hard to get a better selection than what he picked out. I would recommend this to anyone that loves meatloaf. It is well worth the money.
5,AWESOME!,Meat Loaf is perhaps one of the most underrated entertainers in the music industry.His range of vocals is extraordinary and the material her presents are fabulous.This is simply a great set of songs.
5,The best CD I ever heard,"It is the best CD I listen to. I hear it every day in the car, at home, at work. It reminds me of my youth, the unforgettable 80's. Meatloaf's voice and talent are unique, Jim Steinman's lyrics are extraordinary, immortals. It is impossible to remain indifferent!"
4,not a perfect compilation,this cd gives a good view of meat's career till so far al the classics are standing on it however this isn't the perfect compilation (witch compilation is ?) the 3 new tracks aren't very special they are all written by Jim steinman and Andrew loyd webber and they just don't sound like meatloaf songs and some of meat's unknown but very good songs are missing here Read'm and weep and More than you deserve From Deadringerand Surf's up from bad attitude i'm sure they could put op more songs on the album than the 19 tracks here it is a 2cdthe Cover looks good and there is lyrics book in it so it ain't that bad.
4,MeatLoaf Greatest Hits,Super CD! I didn't like all the songs but the CD is worth buying. My wife likes Meatloaf very much. She found this CD to be fantastic.
5,"the best delay i ever used, eats batteries","if you are looking for an awsome delay stompbox, look no further. this delay has it all. what ever the tone is that you are looking for, you can dial it in with ease as well as get some effects that are not really available on others.that inovative foot tap to help get the time down is so useful, i don't know how i got by without it. word of caution though. this eats batties and you CAN NOT use cheap 9volts. I thought that i bought a bad stompbox at first because the light on it would lite up, but no sound would come through. you need to use duricell ultra or lithium batteries and make sure you have plenty extra on hand. But if you can, i get the power adapter. you will be so glad you did."
3,Does not increase depth!!,"If you are looking to increase your depth, this is not the way to do it. On air tests, this coil gets the exact same depth as my 6"" coil. It does however give you a wider field of detection, which is nice when you are in an area that is not very trashy. This coil does not discriminate nearly as well as my smaller coil. I will consistantly dig pull-tabs that sound like quality targets, up side of that is that I get a lot more nickles, which also come in as a high tone. I almost sent it back because of the non-increase in depth, but decided to keep it for relic-hunting. I don't recommend it for coin shooting."
2,Not for a Bounty Hunter,I have a Bounty Hunter Time Ranger and this coil would not work . Must be an aftermarket coil and made for another application. Tried two of them with no success. Too bad because it was a great price for the coil.
3,"Complete, but Inconvenient","This is a Fakebook of the vocals, not the music so much. So no musical bridges, and it's aimed at solo instruments rather than piano or guitar. It does have all (or at least a very large amount of) his songs, but it's the vocal part it has, with a few areas of instrumental notes called out.The biggest problems with this book are that it has a glued binding, so it won't lie flat easily without loosening the pages, and that the songs most often begin on the right-page and require a page flip even when only two pages long. The music is good, and it has a lot of great stuff he wrote but wasn't famous for such as ""Because the Night"" (made famous by 10,000 Maniacs) and ""Blinded By The Light"". But be prepared for some annoyances due to the binding and layout."
3,BUY A SAILOR!!!,"These work for the average weekender. But money is better spent on a sailer.Absolutely NO reason they can justify charging as much as they do. Life span is short and painful. SQL fades with life leaving you to so frustrated you will throw this radio in the water out of frustration!BUY A SAILOR!BTW: NOT ""waterproof"""
1,Defective,"I love this show. The characters are wonderful and the situations are hysterical and romantic.My problem is with the physical product. I've got through four different copies of this set and all of them have had defective DVD's in them. Finally, purely out of the affection for the show, I kept the last one and was thankfully able to make do with a copy of a bad disc.If you can get this show in a different format, such as digital, do so."
2,Cd doesn't work,The cd isn't scratched or anything.it looks brand new but it skips and freezes over and over again.i was so excited to receive this cd and watch my favorite soap opera of all time but it kept skipping.i was disappointed.i ordered two and both of them didn't work properly
5,ME ENCANTÓ!!!,siempre quise comprar la serie completa!!! así que se dio la oportunidad y ya la tengo en mis manos! :Da un buen precio!
2,Tough reading,"This book was written for entomologists. The keys are useful, but the writing is tedious. I was disappointed that there were not photos and drawings of the various life stages of the species of bots.This is an excellent book if you are looking for keys to identification and information on the distribution of the Cuterebra species. It is not a good book if you are interested in learning about the behavior and other life characteristics of the species."
4,The Power and the Gory,"Is this any different from legitimate opera singing? And what's the diference between opera and opry? I never could keep those things straight. More power to her, I say. I wish she was around today; she'd do duets with Andrea Bocelli, who, incidentally, has invented a new kind of pasta."
1,Is this a joke?,"Actually to deserve 0, ""zero"", stars this should go thru an enormous improvement. There is nothing musical in this CD, the vocal technique is so poor that as a listener you feel like praying for the next note to be in tune, in tempo. I have heard of the importance of having rubish also in the music world. This is a typical example of what vultures would eat. It made me laugh though!"
5,Superb! Stupendous! Magnificent!,Her voice is sweeter than an angel's! She makes Whitney Houston sound like aKaraoke singer! Long live the great FFJ (Florence Foster Jenkins)!!!
1,voice of darkness,"as joseph conrad once wrote, ""the horror, the horror."" this is a must own if you are a masochist or a purveyor of kook culture- ms. jenkins is, without a doubt, one of the worst opera singers to ever darken the stage with her presence. although she gets points for effort, ms. jenkins manages to find the right note only accidentally, often shooting her voice across tonal wastelands in the attempt. her rhythym is as shaky as her voice, creating a manic presence-- she is a songbird, but only in the context of being devoured by a large cat. indeed, the recordings of a madwoman. her story is far more interesting than her performance, the rich widow who took her fortune and made a career for herself, selling out carnegie hall with performances more befitting an execution than a opera concert. buy a copy for your next kitsch dinner party, then bury it in the backyard, under consencrated ground..."
5,A classic CD.,I have a well worn copy of the LP and am very grateful to find the CD - anyone who has not had the experience of listening to this has missed on the great laughs in history.
4,The Lady's For Real!,"Honestly! This should not be considered first as an example of operatic/vocal or whatever, as Florence Foster Jenkins was a ""true, sincere artist"" in her own mind! In a way, it's sad to have so much fun listening to this wealthy matron squeek her way through Lehar and Mozart. But, doggonit! She had always wanted a singing career. When her wealthy husband died, FFJ decided SHE would being this career. For this recital, she rented Carnegie Hall, made her own costumes, and even threw flowers back to her audience. She happily chirps on in part of this album with her accompanist Cosme McMoon (for real?) assisting. It's a hoot! But laugh with the dear girl! She was happy and really oblivious to her success.(When she first put her concert tickets up for grabs, she had few takers, but soon her concert became THE place to be!) The ""flip"" side of the disc isn't nearly as ""campy"", but several unknowns making porridge out of ""Faust""....Madge Bruner Hazen"
5,shock treatment!,"Perfect wakeup for narcoleptics, removing unwanted guests, irritating neighbors with barking dogs, getting even with teenagers who play their rap too loud, and the perfect gift for those relatives who hate you but always want to exchange names at Christmas time. It may even help clean clogged drains!"
3,Recommended on official Hopi website,"I haven't read this book yet, but wanted people to know the Hopi themselves recommend it. See this website: www.hopi.nsn.us/Pages/Read%20List/readlist.html."
2,Required reading...,"I had this book as required reading for a college course. For someone thoroughly interested in the topic, go for it. If you have a passing interest in Hopi culture, or are looking for an interesting read, pass on this book. Very dry, definitely felt directed towards academics; this book is a LIFE HISTORY written BY AN ANTHROPOLOGIST for ANTHROPOLOGISTS! If that's what you're interested in, full speed ahead; if you're interested in a good read, pick up something else."
3,Romantic story,"I have family that live in Beaufort (SC), so I was intrigued to read this book and read about areas of which I was familiar. It was a good book, but I found a discrepancy that bothered me. I tend to want to know details about characters in a book, especially their ages. In this book, there was a character named Amun. The book starts in 1860. On page 19, it explains that Amun was orphaned at the age of 5 in a hurricane of 1847, which would mean she was born in 1842. Being set in 1860, that means Amun would be 18 years old in 1860, but on page 23, she says she's 15."
4,Recommended,"Took on a trip to Cancun and it worked very well. Went no more than 8-10 feet deep, but it didn't leak."
1,Cut down version of the Japan rough guide,"I bought this thinking that it is a more in-depth guide of Tokyo. But it is simply a cut down version of the Tokyo section of Rough guide to Japan. I immediately returned it because I'd already bought the latter. For the price, I would at least expect something more original.The only advantage over the guide to Japan is that it is pocket-sized."
3,Good overview -- some details wrong,"The Rough Guide to Tokyo provided a good overview of the city and some of the best tourist destinations. The overview of the regions in the city was particularly helpful, as were the transportation guides (although similar information was available at subway stations.)Several times during our one week visit, my wife and I attempted to find a restaurant or bar that was recommended or described in the Rough Guide, only to discover that it had closed some time ago. This was particularly frustrating as the 3rd edition was less than a year old at the time of publication.Overall, a convenient way to get your feet wet, but ask the locals where to eat for dinner, they gave better advice and the restaurants still existed!"
3,game,"Tetris is a favorite of mine, but this version is not like previous played tetris games so I was a bit disappointed, but for the price its okay."
3,Fun,I have always enjoyed Tetris on my GameBoy and so this is a welcome addition to my collection for Nintendo DS.
3,Needs co-op mode,"I bought this game to play with my spouse, but it only has competitive two-player modes. We're competitive enough in real life, thanks, and what we need from our games is cooperative play, which this title doesn't seem to have. The puzzles (in single-player mode) are really fun to solve, though."
2,sort of bites...,"I've had this on my wish list forever and only just got it off Marketplace. The graphics are super lame and the game play is so-so. I guess I just wanted classic Tetris only with Touch Screen and this is not it. The Tower puzzle in Touch mode is OK but the rest is sort of boring and lame. It was so retro and lacking any innovation as well as the classic mode, I thought I might have been shipped a knock off."
1,Never received product,"I have never received this item and Amazon said they would help. If you have to buy from Sunshine, do not. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon, but we don't forget."
4,Tetris for the DS,"A traditional Tetris game but with some great new twists. I love the two player functions - particularly the game Push where you attempt to shove more rows at your opponent as quickly as possible while they are doing the same to you. The mechanics of the game are the same, but the colors and graphics are better...I think the music is less annoying too but I usually just turn the sound off. This would make a good game for kids, adults who like time killers and puzzle games, and anyone who just wants to have some fun with a friend while they are waiting around. (My husband and I play while we are waiting for tables in restaurants)"
4,Frickin' Addicting,"So much fun. I suck horribly at tetris, but some of the puzzle modes are fun and challenging. I got the game for my wife... The only other game she'll play anymore is Cooking Mama, but that's not too often. You can select your opening music, but not your music during the game :(. Other than that, it's great fun."
5,Tetris DS,"Tetris DS is great introduction to the classic puzzle game. The gaming feel of the backgrounds is great but what makes my day is the multiplayer goodies included here. Tetris DS is a great example of how to make good use of the new portable gaming machine's download features. This game is still just as addictive now as it was back in the day and while it has been reworked to play well with the new DS technology, it sacrifices very little and thus makes this a puzzle game worth your time and money. If you own a Nintendo DS, this is but another game you cannot be without."
5,EXCELLENT GAME,I PLAYED TETRIS YEARS AGO AND THE NINTENDO DS VERSION IS NOT BAD AT ALL. THE GAME KEEPS YOUR MIND SHARP. AND WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THAT. IT HAD GREAT GRAPHICS AND THE MUSIC IS COOL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES A CHALLENGE.
2,it didnt work I sent it back and the person who sent understood the problem and full refund.,it didnt work ! I am still looking for ine that works I had one enjoyed playing it now i want another one/
1,White Screen of DEATH,"Unfortunately, the game I received does not work... Pity, I love Tetris and would never have killed it.After the Nintendo DS warning screen... I touched it to continue and... it turns a ghostly white. The poor game is dead and I am in limbo awaiting the seller on AMAZON to determine what to do.I purchased it used and chose a seller who had a ""great"" reputation and who stated it was in ""like new"" condition.Now, I wait for their determination, I do not like this kind of customer service. Will keep you all posted!"
4,Pretty fun Tetris.,Well I bought the game and took it home to play. I played for a couple hours with all the modes and let me tell you something. It's Tertris with Nintendo characters. The 8-bit look looks cool and you got six modes which is basically Tetris with toching to move them or doing missons. In the end it's pretty addictive and will keep your interest for a long time.
4,good but a few baddies,"I love this cd, its so much fun! Every song on it is awesome except for 3. Staring at the sun is boring and gets old, the end of line makes me cry and pay the man is just bad. The best track is shes got issues cause i can relate to it =)"
4,"Trust me on this, you won't be sorry","Wow! This album is remarkble, in more than one way...The energy throughout is fantastic...A lot of the songs really get your blood pumping, get you dancing around the room like a maniac. The two or so songs that I sometimes skip are ""She's Got Issues"" and ""Why Don't You Get A Job?"", because they're not up-tempo enough for me right then, not because they aren't great...The lyrics of literally *every* song are intelligent, intricate, sometimes biting and sarcastic, but always thought-provoking and never trite. The music itself can be equally sarcastic (such as the tune ""Walla Walla""), but is always well-crafted. The best thing I can say about this album is that it provokes you to move, think, express yourself, and release yourself all at once, without the music ever getting boring."
3,Could've been better,"This is a good album... That is, if you're into pop music. I mean, sure this was my first Offspring album, but that was before I discovered their earlier work like ""Ixnay On The Hombre"" and ""Ignition"".Sure, a few songs on this CD are good, namely these:* ""Americana""* ""No Brakes""* ""End Of The Line""* ""The Kids Are Alright""* ""Have You Ever""* ""Pay The Man"".Basically, the album isn't that bad, but it could have been MUCH better. ""Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)"", ""Why Don't You Get A Job"", and ""She's Got Issues"" are just too pop for me."
4,A fun cd,"This a good, fun, album. It has a good variety of punk style. From the fast pase punk of ""Staring at the Sun"", to the slower catchy rhythym of ""Why don't you get a job"". The best song is ""The kids aren't allright"", its got a great tune, as you probably know if you've heard it on the radio. The whole album isn't exactly what you would call amazingly written music, but it's still a great, upbeat, fun, cd. Get it if you like that sort of style, if you like more traditional rock, don't get this album."
2,THIS IS MTV PUNK-ROCK,"Yes,this is MTV commercial punk-rok for teenagers and BSB fan there are Three good song:Have you ever,the kids aren't alright and americana but all the other songs especially pretty fly are only commercial songs write to make money. I was a great offspring fan and now i respect them but if you want to heard good punk songs don't buy americana but buy Smash, ignition snd self titled offspring album. Thanks."
5,This cd is the coolest cd ever!!,"I think that this cd rocks the world. My cousin listen to it, he gave it 1 star, and he loved it!! He didn't know what to do that's all. His birthday is today and he wants the single of pretty fly (for a white guy). That song reminds me of a young man named Taylor, his last name is to hard to spell, so I'll give his nickname, Taylor Uglysbee. (HE'S FINE, and his nickname has nothing to do with his looks!!) Kelli Farmer"
3,It stinks.,It has two songs that are actually played on the radio.The rest of them(songs) just stink.
3,It's OK...,"The music's OK. I guess I was just expecting the CD to be more like the songs ""Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)"" and ""Why Don't You Get A Job"". The only songs that I would play over are ""Pay The Man"", ""P.F.(F.A.W.G.)"", and ""W.D.Y.G.A.J."" Personally, I think The Offspring's older songs are better."
4,It was pretty good.,"This is a good cd, but not the best. There about four good songs, Staring at the Sun, Pretty Fly, The kids aren't Alright, and Why Don't you Get a job. I thought it was good but could have been better. I would still reccomened it though. They are just like Green Day accept a little better. So all you Green Day fans you'd like this."
3,Americana had it's good parts...and bad parts,Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) would've been better if it hadn't been over-played by radio-stations and MTV. Americana had some pretty funky songs (Pay The Man) but it had redeeming qualities too (Walla Walla). Smash was better.
5,Offspring Rules! This cd rules!,"This is a great cd from a great band- The best songs are Pretty Fly for a White Guy, Why Don't You Get A Job, Americana, and Pay the Man. Stop waisting money on the Spice Girls and Britney Spears, and buy Americana!"
3,"Decent, but repetitive","Overall decent, better than most fare on the radio. ""The Kids Are Allright"", ""Feelings"" and ""Walla Walla"" are definitely the best songs. ""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" gets real old, real fast. Somewhat disappointed in the lack of maturity. Overall, it's not as good as ""Smash"", but not as bad as ""Ixnay on the Hombre."""
1,Comparable to the Spice Girls,"My 11 year old sister recently went through her Spice Girls stage. Now she hates them. what's funny is, her new favorite band is the offspring. All little kids go through stages, and the offspring is just a fad, that although it seems prolonged, will go away. (yes, I've heard this CD, and it IS music for 11 year olds - BAD)"
5,"Great, but not as good as Smash, which was excellent!!","Don't buy this CD for Pretty Fly. It is the worst song on the CD. Songs such as ""The Kids Arent Allright,"" ""Stareing At the Sun,"" and ""Americana"" are excellent songs. If you are looking for your first Offspring CD, then you should defenately buy Smash."
3,"I really only know 1 song, but I like it anyway!!!","I don't have the Offspring CD, but I have an infatuation for the song ""Pretty Fly For A White Guy."" I think that is a really great song. if you love that song like me, buy the CD."
2,Americana is a big dissaponitment,"I traded a cd for americana, i heard it, and they had no energy in this album, pretty fly(for a white guy)is the worsest song ,and why don't you get a job? is too, i think they should more work into their next album, americana is a big dissaponitment"
2,"They've gone downhill since ""Smash""","Smash was excellent, ixnay was pretty good but a little bit tamer, I think americana is just awful. They've left their roots, going from in-your-face punk rockers to 1 and 2 chord playing ""Weird Als"" of modern rock with ""pretty fly (for a white guy)"" and ""why don't you get a job?"" (which sounds a hell of a lot like polka). if you want to experience true offspring, definitely get ""smash"" and then if you're hooked, buy ""ixnay in the hombre,"" but I wouldn't bother with ""americana."""
2,Offspring's stuck in wuss-ville,"Offspring should've stuck to their roots... I probably expect too much from this band, as they're the first rock band I EVER saw live in 1995 (I found out REALLY quick what a mosh pit was), but this does NOT even compare to SMASH. The singles on MTV are amusing at that, but musically it does nothing for me. I would've given it an extra star, but since some people are giving it 5's, I have to stick with 2. If you want some REAL Offspring, get SMASH."
2,This sucks,"This CD has to be the worst offspring ever!! I am a longtime fan of offspring and this CD was awful. Smash was awesome but this........ The lyrics are pathetic, they say absolutlee nothing over and over again. Don't buy this CD.It is awful.O yea...you know Fieldy from KoRn? He rules"
2,Terrible in comparison to SMASH,"This album shows how my favorite Orange county punk-rock outfit is getting progressively worse with each big label release. Ever since they left Epitaph their music has been going downhill. Ixnay on the Hombre was a halfway decent cd, but Americana is outright pathetic in comparison to the Offspring's all-time greats SMASH and Ignition.The only reason I gave this record the second star is because the first two songs on this cd are great, if not inspired. The remainder of the album, however, is awful. ""Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)""? I guess that's how the Offspring sees themselves these days. Too bad I don't."
5,This CD rocks!!,"I have heard every single song on this CD and it kicks butt! My favorites are The Kids Arn't Alright, and Pretty Fly For a White Guy. I definatly recommend Americana."
4,Classic Offspring Rock with a New Roll!,"Two words: Kick ass! The new Offspring album is just that. Having acquired it before it is even officially released, my opinion is completely unbiased. This CD is a great accomplishment for the band, as they not only stick to the classic Offspring-style rock (She's Got Issues, Walla Walla) but they've also added new funk and turntable effects (Why Don't You Get A Job, Pretty Fly), all contributing to awesome powerful sound! Everything's got the expected Offspring extreme attitude too; with Offspring's near-screaming voice setting the tone up one notch throughout the CD. This is a rockin' album; well worth the buy!"
2,GROUP OF SELLOUTS MAKE OVERRATED CD,"The offspring are burnt out. If you liked their previous efforts, or are a hardcore fan, then you will most likely despise of this album. They got lucky with the underrated song ""The Kids Aren't Alright"". But many of thes songs such as ""Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)"", and ""Why Don't You Get a Job"" are of poor quality and are quite annoying. Effort seems to lack on all but one of these songs."
3,Kinda creepy,"I love The Offspring, don't get me wrong. But some of the songs, and especially the pictures inside the case, really creep me out. Although, not completely freaky, it also has some great hits such as Pretty Fly and Get a Job. It is a moderate album with good beats, sort of depressing lyrics, for an all around okay CD."
2,people just dont know,"i actually work with people that think this is thier first album, it makes me think what if they had gotten to know the music like i did. the true angst and pure punk that they used to represent. this cd is garbage, if you really want to hear good offspring music please buy thier self titled track and ignition and truly appreciate these guys back when they had something to say, or just something extremely vulger but entertaining to shout. but if you really dig this cd those 2 might scare you. not mtv material."
3,"Layered tracks, higher production, less music.","ok, I'm not going complain about how this was there major sellout album or whatever. I'm rating this three stars for the music and nothing else. There are a few really good tracks on here, but it doesn't totally make up for the majority.Highlights include: No Brakes, Pay the Man, Staring at the Sun, Have you Ever, and End of the Line was pretty decent. Everything else is pretty much the poppy watered down Offspring that we know today.I think these songs (as well as the rest) would be greatly improved IF, Dexters vocals didn't sound as produced. He used to have such a unique, raw voice, but since Americana, that quality has been lost. I think the main factor was switching to a major label..but whatever. To each their own, right?"
3,Ixnay!,"Everybody knows The Offspring. Who doesn't remember 'Self Esteem'? But it was just 5 years ago that The Offsping made me love their music. That was all because of my sister who bought 'Pretty fly'. On the B-side, there was the live version of 'All I want'. I loved(and still love) that song. Than 'The kids aren't alright' came out. I immediately bought 'Americana'. Yeah well..I was a little bit disappointed. The only song I constantely listened to was 'The kids aren't alright'. The other songs are just above average. Later, I remembered 'All I want'. I got out and bought 'Ixnay on the hombre' and fell in love with it. So go out and buy Ixnay!"
4,Pretty Fly (for a white guy),"ok first of all pretty fly (for a white guy) is not a poser song. It is however a song about posers and how gay the are...anybody who didnt notice this when they first heard the song was really bloody stupid and probably was a poser (posers usually are the ones to yell poser about others the loudest)....this a great cd over all, possibly their best....do not compare the offspring in anyway shape of form to good charlotte..if you do you deserve to be decapitated....the offspring was at one time on the same level as greenday back when greenday was good...Why dont you get a job and pretty fly for a white guy, which only account for two songs on the cd, are intentionally poppy, this is because the irony of it goes well with the song......"
5,Great album!,"The offspring are my favorite band, and all the albums deserve 5 stars including Americana. It's a really great album. The music sounds great, and it has really great lyrics. I think Have You Ever is the best song on the album, but they're all great!"
4,Great! I love this c.d.,"I've liked The Offspring since 1995. My cousin played ""Smash"" on his portable boom-box on the fourth of July in his van. That was a big hit album for them. Then it seemed like nobody noticed The Offpsring anymore and it made me mad. Now I was ecited about ""Americana"" when I heard about it, but I didn't think anyone else would care. I was very surprised when ""Pretty Fly"" became a huge hit! I think this is the best c.d. I own! I don't give it 5 stars because I just can't give any of the c.d.'s I have 5 stars. I really recommend this c.d.!-Matt Laird"
5,I absolutely love this CD!!!!,This has gotta be the best CD I've bought ever! It was really great because after I got sick of Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) I still loved all of their other songs so it was never a waste of money or anything. I'd encourage anyone else to get it.
2,What happened????,"Their other CD's are so much better, Smash is by far the best. There's like 2 good song's on Americana. So if you are intending on buying this CD, don't get Smash instead.(or Limp Bizkit, KoRn, ICP, Sublime, or Rob Zombie)"
5,wHaT An aWESOME cOMBINATION oF mUSIC.....,"I found that OFFSPRING did a very excellent Jop. They really did put different kinds of music(Rap, Crunch, POp,and Rock) together in most of their songs, which my friends and I like. They are really the sound of the Millenium. Betta have one.......of your own."
5,Cd kicks,I have listened to it once than got hooked on it for a while. If you want some modern day music buy americana because it has awesome songs on it. Beter than other offspring. It's about equal to smash.
2,Who wouold like it?,"OK, it was good the first time, but all the songs sound the same, and it is a huge waste of money! Save you money and get the Beastie Boys!"
3,it's ok,"some of the stuff is ok, but nothing is fantastic. If u want a good offspring cd get Smash instead."
2,what happened????,"i gotta agree with.... SELLOUTS .... cuz this is totally telling out towards kids, which is fine for kids, but what about the OLDER fans?? If you want REAL Offspring, go for their 1st 2 albums, NOT this one. This has a couple of good songs, hence 2 stars, ""The Kid's Aren't Alright"" & ""She's Got Issues"". ""Pretty Fly"" can go home, that song gets on my freaking nerves, almost as bad as the annoying video itself. So take a good HARD listen for those over 20 or so who preferred stuff from SMASH."
4,"a good cd, but still disappointing","I give Americana four stars. Now if I was rating the band as a whole,they would get 5 stars. No, they would get 20 stars. But this cd just isn't The Offspring. Now don't get mewrong, it's a good cd. Compare it to almost everything else out there and it just blows them away. But compare it to TheOffspring's previous four albums (that's right, contrary to popular belief,The Offspring are not a newband), and Americana is a disappointment. Us true fans expected more from them. If this is all you've ever heard by The Offspring, then you don't really know what the band is all about. My suggestion: go get the s/t or Ignition or Smash and listen to them before you go dissing The Offspring like you all do when you don't know anything about them. Oh, and by the way, it's ""THE Offspring"", not just ""Offspring"". That irritates the hell outta me."
4,Awesome for the Offspring,A really good beginners rock Cd. Definately worth it. Not much more than 3 or 4 really bad words. Clean for it's genre.--Matt
3,"""WHY DONT YOU GET A LIFE?""","I LOVE OFFSPRING.I HAVE BEEN A FAN SCINCE I WAS 5. AND I THINK THIS ABLUM IS OKAY. BUT GAY PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY ARE OFFSPRING FANS RUINED IT. THE ONLY REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE BOUGHT THIS CD WAS BECAUSE OF PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY. I GUESS THE GIRLS IN THE SONG JUST MAKE THEM HORNEY OR SOMETHING. RADIO, MTV, AND PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE ROCK OR ANY OTHER OFFSPRING SONGS RUINED THIS CD. BUY SMASH. IT IS SOOOO MUCH BETTER"
4,"Among the best of their recent albums, ""Ixnay"" may be better","I have 3 things to say: 1. I wanna get the first 3 of their albums, and see how they've changed. 2. The Offspring certainly are a dynamic and forceful band. 3. I have had a punk obsession for many years thanks to the Ramones !!"
3,pretty fly for a punk band,"Okay, so there are some clever lyrical twists, and it's still prety good compared to most of the crap on the radio. Compared to their previous efforts, however, it seems like self-indulgent grandstanding. It also lacks the feeling of connection to a punk rock musical history that was the true strength of the other albums. It'll probaly outsell 'em all."
1,No Extra Tracks,"This CD is a Japanese import with NO extra tracks, it was originally listed as having extra tracks but Amazon has since changed the listing after I brought it to their attention. I returned it and bought a non-import for a lot less money. I have bought many Japanese imports and most have extra tracks because the prices for cd's are higher in Japan. The other reviewer who says that there is an extra track after Pay The Man is incorrect, that is a hidden track and it's on the lower-priced American release so save your money and buy it instead."
5,This group has a beat that you can really groove too!,I like totally love this band.This is like my favorite cd....I listen to it all the time.My fav song on this album has to be.......She's got issues.I think the beginning of that song is so RAD!~!All in all ...THEY ROCK!
1,come on they can do better than this,this cd sux.i got this cd the first day i got it man was i dissapointed.i mean theirs 2 good tracks no brakes and the kids arnet alright.but the rest......dont buy it every time i turn on the radio their music is on i just want to ......ugggg
2,Its OK,"I bought this album a few days ago and I think it is OK. Its not as good as their other albums like Smash and Ignition. They are losing their place in the hardcore/punk area of music. They should go back and make more of the real old skool punk. Some of the songs, like Amaricana and The End of the Line were good. But the rest of the songs should not even be listened to. I mean, come on, what are they trying to make now, Hip-Hop? I recomend that you think before you buy this album."
2,you choose,this cd is not bad most of the songs arent as pretty fly and why dont you get a job would suggest this is not a punk cd but its not a pop cd eather its kind of an alternative cd its a lot softer than ther previous cds.most the songs where ok besides there two videos songs feelings and walla walla my favirates where have you ever and americana there too good for this album
5,Oddly Favorable,"For some reason I found myself singing and humming to the tunes from this album, that's the first sign of a great album.Buy it!"
1,Interested in punk rock? Buy something original instead.,"These guys make a living off ripping people and other artists off. Every track on this CD could have been on a Bad Religion (but without intelligence), NOFX, or Pennywise album. Yeah, like any of the people who reviewed this care...I simply suggest getting into the artists who invented and actually added something interesting to punk rock. And one other thing: ""Why Don't You get a Job?"" is a blatant rip off of the Beatles' ""Ob-la-di Ob-la-da."" Don't support these rip-off artists!!!"
3,"Definetly a step in the wrong direction, Dexter...","I dont know what you were on when you put together this album, but you must have been seriously trashed. To the listeners, this album is good, but it is not Offspring, the only good songs are Americana and Pay the Man. All the rest are Janes Addiction rip-offs. Buy Ignition or Smash instead"
3,Its ok but...,"This CD is pretty good, i dont know 13$ good. I am a huge offspring fan and have all 6 CD's including the club one. Whoever said there were 4 up there in the review doesnt know... Selftitled, Ignition, Club CD, Smash, Ixnay on the Hombre, Americana. Anyway, if you dont have smash GET THAT INSTEAD! 10x's better. i just downloaded the Americana CD in MP3 format and burned it onto a CD in WAVE format, so its just like a real one for free ;D"
3,Pretty fly (for a white guy),"The best song on this CD is definitely ""Pretty fly (for a white guy)"". Most of the other songs are more like Metallica songs..in a way. But the song I just mentioned is the best dance song there is on this CD. It's great to listen to on your way home after school."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!,"This CD is a great one, if you like heavy metal. The rest of the songs on the CD are better then Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)! I think anyone who likes heavy metal should add it to their collection."
5,Offspring is the best in the world,"This group is the best and the cd is wonderful, I think everyone should own it. I love it and I'm sure the anyone who hears it will agree with me."
3,Could Have Been Worse,"Okay so maybe its not Smash, Ignition, or their self-titled album. Those of you who say Smash is the best have probably never listened to or heard of their first 2 albums. Anyway, this CD is their worst yet. It's real good though just not punk-like anymore. They sucked ever since they went to Columbia. Buy this CD if you like soft punk or just The Offspring. If anything buy their first album (remade in 95) The Offspring."
3,Pretty fly (for white guys),"Punk rock = Offspring...right? Well, obviously, not anymore. Okay, so some songs (""Pretty Fly"", ""The Kids aren't alright"", and ""End of the Line"") were awesome, but can I just say that the songs ""Walla Walla"" and ""Feelings"" sucked? ""Americana"" was alright too, but only if you actually made it through that first minute of drums and stuff- ditto on the track ""Pay the Man"", only that was for the first three minutes.(Okay track if you plan on falling asleep.) Offspring, what happened here? I used to think you did punk rock. Now I'm not so sure..."
4,monkeys,this was a pretty good album but not as good as smash!americana is the best track on here ! i rated this 4 star cause it has two annoying songs on here pretty fly and why dont you get a job! the kids arnt alright are good too! this cd when i got it was no parental advisory!
4,"Watch out, the offspring is about.","This album has the POWER of rock music, more that the previous albums had. Hey, guys! If you like rock music and disortion, Buy it! (The first songs are POWERFUL!!)"
3,uhh,"okay the offspring used to be a very good punk band. with such albums as smash and ignite. now this album is still punk but its just a little boring. there are some good songs and one great one ""the kids aren't alright"". Now i would say 3.5 stars but the terrable song ""get a job"" just kills it."
3,How Do I Put This,"This album is great to own for any Offspring collection. It has some fabulous songs that are catchy and of course send a message, as always. The only reason I give it three stars is because in MY OPINION it isn't their best album. It's a completely different sound (and on some songs, not for the better). For those of you who like Pretty Fly for a White Guy, then you'll love this album. I was not impressed with that song, hence this isn't a favorite. However, this CD is still worthy of playing and owning, especially if you want to have a complete Offspring collection. If you're new to listening to The Offspring, I'd try a different album on for size to start with, maybe Ixnay on the Hombre or Conspiracy of One. Otherwise, it's every man for himself on this one!"
4,"Quit calling it ""pop""","It saddens me that so many people feel the need to criticize this album. Everybody and their brother complains about how ""this isn't the old offspring"" or, ""it's too pop."" Bands evovling aren't allways a bad thing. The term ""sellout"" has to be one of the most overused terms in the music community. People feel the need to declare a band a ""sellout"" if they slightly change their style from one album to the next. From Green Day to Korn, every band is called a sellout because they change. If you like the punkier Offspring, fine; go out and buy Ixnay on the Hombre or Smash. If you enjoy a slightly different Offspring style, buy Americana. It's a very solid album, especially ""The Kids Aren't Alright."""
2,Americana is a big dissaponitment,"I traded a cd for americana, i heard it, and they had no energy in this album, pretty fly(for a white guy)is the worsest song ,and why don't you get a job? is too, i think they should put more work into their next album, americana is a big dissaponitment"
1,This CD was an obvious failed attempt to be funny.,"This CD was a failed attemp to impersonate Weird Al Yankovich. The lyrics are attempting to be funny but are old, bland, and repetitive. The lead singer has no change whatsoever in his voice. He sounds like he has a cold the entire CD. Unfortunatley, Pretty Fly for a White Guy, was completely overplayed into oblivion. I at first liked this song, sadly. I also was a fan of the Offspring before this horrible CD. I especially cant stand the unthoughtful lyrics. The videos are even worse!!! They are so far from funny. I wish that at the end of ""why dont you get a job"" the dynamite would have blown up the whiny lead singer. That about sums it up."
2,the worst Offspring album!,by far the worst! don't buy this! P.S. to Amazon.com: This album is not Parental Advisory!
1,OFFSPRING,I'm a hudge Green Day fan so when I bought a Green Day cd my friend told me that the Offspring were almost the same so I bought there cd and was very very disipointed the cd is lamer than lame. But thats only my oppion.
3,The downward spiral....,"This album lacks the substance and soul of the previous four. As far as I'm concerned, Offspring have become trendy sellouts singing what they think people want rather than writing what they feel. My advice...buy the older ones."
5,offspring fan,This cd is addictive. I bought it like five months ago and I listen to it every day. There has not been a single offspring cd that I have not liked. There are awesome lyrics and it is a must-have cd. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"not their best, but worthwhile!","""Walla Walla"" is an annoying song, but the rest of this album manages to rock pretty well. ""She's got Issues"", ""Why don't you get a job?"" and of course ""Pretty Fly"" are fun punk-pop with the emphasis on pop. I also like the more serious, punkish ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" and ""Americana"". The CD ends with a long, groovy, largely instrumental track. Offspring depart a little from pure punk madness but keep some good visceral rockers in there, managing to steer away from artsy disappointment and entertain us all the while. The CD opens with a funny knock on American push-button materialism. So get your credit card and buy this album, you money-grubbing Offspring fan!"
3,Typical Offspring,"I liked Smash quite a bit. Admittedly, I've only heard the Offspring albums Smash and Americana. However, I fail to notice any evolution in the Offspring's music. It's the same old stuff, no change. They're stubbornly sticking to their own style and not broadening their horizons. This is not always a bad thing, but most of the songs on Americana sound extremely similar. If you're a long-time HARDCORE Offspring fan, I suppose you might like it since they haven't really changed, but there's much room for improvement (and diversity) on here."
1,"Suck, Suck, Suck","That is the only word for this CD. Suck. Every single song sounds exactly the same. Total garbage. Don't waste a penny of your hard earned money, unless your mommy and daddy can buy it for you, then go ahead and waste their money."
1,this c-d has to be the worst c-d i have,this c-d has only 2 good songs on it. The reast are absolutly terribl
3,"Fair album, despite the negative comments","Why does it seem that everyone that reviews this CD seems to look at the world around the album rather than the album itself? I keep reading these reviews and all I see are comments about the people who like ""pretty fly(for a white guy)"" are deemed ""posers"" or ""trendsters"". I've loved the Offspring since I first heard ""Smash"" and I'm not going to let some 14 year old kid who hates all the little preppy kids that seem to all of a sudden ""discovered"" the Offspring because they were watching MTV. Even with all of the overhype, I would still rather listen to this than the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync. But aside from the comments, it's a decent effort by Offspring, but I'm still waiting for another Smash."
2,a step down from punk,"this group used to one of the all time greatest punk bands around with, NOFX, RANCID, PENNYWISE and such... as a huge die-hard offspring fan, it is hard to give my favorite band sucha review. The songs are not as punk-driven as the original offspring...the lyrics have matured, yet are a little worst. The drums/bass are the same...yet not as noticeable as in ""Ignition"" ""Conspiracy of One"" ""Offspring (self titled) and such. Everyone who wrote a good review about this was either because of the song ""pretty fly (for a white guy)"" or because they do not know the offspring well. lets see what offspring can do with their new cd coming out in december 2003.."
1,Zero stars if i could!,"I liked the Offspring even when they got more rock and less punk, this killed them for me. All the other CDs before this were great to good(but not real punk) this is a poppy, lame, pos. I can't tell what is worse, Blink 182 after ""Dude Ranch"", or ""new"" Offspring. No, i mean which was more of a waste of money, ""Americana"" or ""Enema of the State"" Like the one guy said, Pretty Fly made it on MTV, but then again so did Tom Green's Bum Bum song for so long they had to retire it. Just sad."
4,Offspring is the real deal,"Ok, first thing I have to say is that, The Kids Aren't Alright song hits the nail on the head. It's the best song on the cd and they need to do more like it. The 2nd best is She's Got Issue's and the 3rd is Pretty Fly. The rest of them are ok."
3,errr...,"this cd ws a big let down it has some great tracks like ""have yoiu ever"" and ""americana"" but so meny doggy ones like ""pretty fly (for a white guy)"" and ""why dont you get a job"" this cd just dosnt cut it and its not for every offspring fan dont expect a ""smash"" from this oneStand out tracks: Have you ever, Americana, no brakes, the kids arnt alright"
2,*Sigh*,"What happened? Did I miss something? When did the Offspring become a pop-rock band? And after such albums as Smash, one of my all-time favorite albums.I liked that one because it was widely appealing to alternative fans of all sorts. Melodic, yet heavy. This one sounds just watered down. The music is weaker, and the lyrics lack meaning.Except ""The Kids Aren't All Right"" That song is true Offspring, not watered down pop. Please,do yourself a favor and pick up ""Smash"". I assure you that you won't be disappointed."
4,This is definetly a bold new line of music for the offspring,This is a great CD it is definetly a great addition to any CD collection. I am priviledged enough to have heard this before it is available to the general public. It is totally fresh compared to the bands older albums make sure you put this one in your shopping cart
3,More pop-punk from sellouts.,"I own 5 of the 6 Offspring albums, 'Americana' is the one I listen to least. The band has switched its style, image, and lyrical-messages to appeal to a larger, dumber, and younger audience with 'Americana'; much of the depthful punk-attitude from their previous cds was lost in this one.If you're thinking of buying this because of songs like ""Why Don't You Get a Job"" or ""Pretty Fly"", then you won't be dissapointed. Most of the album sounds like that. If you're looking into 'Americana' as a continuation of older albums like 'Smash', 'Ixnay', or 'Ignition', keep in mind that this sounds nothing like any of those. With this album, Offspring have (de)evolved into a more poppish-angry sound."
1,Offspring: Americana,"Offspring had an amazing CD in Smash but they sold out when they wrote Americana. Real fans knew who they were before MTV started playing Pretty Fly For A White Guy. They were good but this CD is horrible. They went from real music to what sounds like polka in Why Don't You Get A Job. Don't waste your time or money buying this CD. If you're gonna get one, get a good one like Smash. The Offspring are sellouts and they only attract teenyboppers now. MTV is messing up the music world. Turn the station."
2,MUST HAVE!,WELL THEN IF YOUR GOING TO BUY THIS PLEASE I ADVISE YOU TO LOOK AT THE CONTENT FIRST AS THEIR IS SOME SWARING IN IT.BUT APART FROM THAT THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE.SINCE TAKING THE ENGLISH AND MANY OTHER CHARTS BY STORM THE OFFSPRING HAVE CAME UP WITH THIS MASTERPIECE.I RATE THIS WELL AND WOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER BUYING THIS.
5,Very good,"This is a good cd. My favorite songs on it are pretty fly, the kids aren't alright, shes got issues, and americana. The other songs are pretty good. I don't like some, but they certainly aren't painful to listen to. This is a cd you can listen to straight through. Worth your money!"
2,Will the real offspring please stand up,"This album is terrible their are some highlights but overall it couldve been much worse. ""Pretty fly""is anawful song and ""why cant you get a job?"" is a not so subtle ripoff. Overall this fits in with all the blink 182, simple plan, good charlotte garbage."
4,A Terrific Effort,"This is one of my favorite CDs for hard-driving, roack-n-roll music. The Offspring shows some maturity and more than a little sarcasm in their songs. Have You Ever is a great start with a strong drum and good guitar licks. The Kids Aren't Alright is another terrific effort, combining excellent guitar, drum and lyrics.THe whole tone of the CD is a frenetic realization that Reality is the Cruelest Dream. THe band is maturing and, with maturity, comes the understanding that life isn't fair and that sometimes, things don't work out for the best. They sing about the different ""pop"" issues of modern culture and lampoon many of them with heavy sarcasm. She's Got Issues is one while Feelings is another."
3,Disappointing,"It was disappointing, but I rated it 3 stars because I really like Offspring. The songs are too commercial, to be played in pop radios. It has good moments, but not too much. It seems that the quality of the songs affected their performance on stage. The last show in Rio de Janeiro was far inferior from the previous one (Ixnay on The Hombre tour, if I can call it this). They were just burocratic, with no energy. As the album, the show was disappointing."
3,i like the old offspring better they were more punk,offspring use to be a good punk band but now they are getting stupid. they have some really good songs on here but i like smash and ignition better than americano.
4,New Album from the sell-outs,"This album is pretty good. This band is no longer a punk band in the fat wreckchords/epitaph generation, but a user friendly rockish punk band. Some songs like staring at the sun and have you ever are good songs though. I dont understand why this band went to columbia, as they could have had sucsess with punk fans if they stayed."
4,Sweet!,"This CD is sweet! I don't have it, so I can't rate it 5 until I hear the other two songs from it that I haven't heard yet. The rest of the songs so far are cool. My favorites are Pretty Fly and Americana. Definitely worth buying."
1,It bites people sorry,"See the Offspring used to be good before they sold out with Pretty Fly for a White guy, which I think is just about the most annoying song in the world other than any rap, and with Why Don't you get a Job?.. that one wasnt AS bad as Pretty fly..etc. but it was still stupid. All I have to say is that Offspring used to be good, but not anymore, they soldout.. so definitely not 5 stars."
5,This CD rocks!,"Even if you haven't listened to any of Offspring's other CDs, I completely recomend this one! I bought it because a friend of mine told me that she liked it, and I can't thank her enough! I'm addicted to Have You Ever, and am listening to it right now. So go buy this CD right now!"
5,Excellent,"This album is the best album I have ever listened to.Especially the ""Pretty fly"",""why don't you get a job""and""Americana"".But why don't they put their photo in this album ?"
4,IT is one of the BEST punk album ever!!!,"i feel that ''The kids aren't allright'' should be the best song of the album.I strongly feel that it should be on the music chart.For me,after listening to 'AMERICANA',i feel that 'Pretty fly{for a white guy}'is one of the weaker tracks from the album..."
3,"Good for ""Job"", not much else","Why don't you get a job is awesome and funny. 'Bout time guys set chix straight! Walla Walla is good, too. Offspring has little talent, but enough to get by. I sense dry humor an almost all their songs, especially ""Feelings.""EXPLICIT Lyrics?! Gimme a break! Three or fours bad words, and they get labeled...what a joke."
4,Offspring=Talent,"I have to admit, The Offspring is a good band, but a little bit of their talent is lacking. Go buy Americana, but before you do, get Ignition and self-titled. If you want real punk this is what you should get.P.S. On top of all the talent, lead-singer Dexter Holland is so beautiful"
1,don't waste your money,this cd's the worst one yet. its not even real music. they only have one good song from Smash.If I could give it no stars thats what I would do. go buy some real music.
5,The improvement upon perfection,"In my opinion, this, the fifth Offspring album, is the best. They've grown up. No, they haven't stopped punk rocking, they've evolved their lyrics. Think about it. Their songs jab at our odd society, most of the time, or use irony and analogy to convey their POV. Or, in the case of Feelings and She's Got Issues, still rely on their old ideas, but comes out on top. The Kids Aren't Alright, for example. Children whose lives suddenly take a wrong turn, like many teens. Pretty Fly For A White Guy. I still like it, even though it is a little overplayed. It stabs at the fact that there are more and more gangstas, and some people try too hard to be accepted. And the blending sounds of Noodles and Greg K are great. This especially shows on Feelings, Kids Aren't Alright, Walla Walla, Have You Ever. The drums are great. If the sixth CD got any better than this, it would be perfection."
1,Terrible...,"God, I can't believe I wasted 20 bucks on this pile. That's the last time I let band-loyalty drive me...now that I've listened to the crap that is Americana, I can go back and listen to Smash and realize just how excellent it was. This, however, is an abomination. Whereas Smash had the classic angry rock and punk tunes, Americana has reverted to ""happier"" tunes. Listen to ""Why Don't You Get a Job"" and then ""Bad Habit"" and see what I mean. I never though I'd say this, but the Offspring have turned into a hybrid of N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys..."
3,Okay.............,"Okay, I just have to say that this c-d only has about 2 good songs on it. They are Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) and Why don't you get a job?. But all the other songs sound completley the same. #1 isn't even a song! and #2 really sucks. #2 song is like the Offspring just got up there and started singing without a song written or anything. it is sooo bad. So I suggest that you get the single for Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) and Why don't you get a job?"
5,This is a great punk rock cd. I absolutely love it!,"This is one of the best cd's I've bought in the recent past. I listen to it at home, car and work (yeah, I wear headphones at the office :)... Offspring is definitely one of the best ""KROQ"" bands. Go Offspring!!!"
2,That's not offspring!!!,"This album is scrap comparing to SMASH, it have only 2 good songs (Have you ever and The kids aren't alright). The offspring just release this album to make money, before this one they would never accept to make a tv interview. If you want some good punk buy Smash or Ixnay on the ombre."
3,i was so disappointed...,"i popped this cd in the first day i got it and it was quite a downshift from the offspring, it seems so incomplete, i was thinking, is this the same band that brought me smash and ixnay on the hombre? cant be. offspring have changed. some people may like this cd, but its just not my thing, although, i have to give kudos on the tracks feelings and the kids arent alright, hey dexter: please oh please return to the way you guys were, if you do, ill overlook this mishap. just please go back to kick a$$ music."
5,Pretty Fly......,"Offspring, one of the greatest bands of all time, really gets the energy pumping with Americana. Most people have heard ""Pretty Fly for a white guy"" and/or ""Why Dont you get a Job"", but some of my favorite songs on here are the lesser known songs like ""Walla Walla"" and ""The Kids arent alright"". I recomend offspring to any one that likes some good uptempo songs that are extremely catchy"
2,"These kids aren't alright, why don't they get a REAL job?","I thought it wasn't possible, but this album sux and blows at the same time. I recommend Smash or ixnay on the hombre. Though ""prettyfly(for a white guy)"" and ""why don't you get a job?"" are OK. Take my advice, buy the singles or get the MP3's."
2,The video rocks and I give the song a 10 and the album a 9!,"The song really shows what guys like and thats to be FLY, and this video has it all and so much more. Not only does it have phat dancing but the lyrics rock also! There's one thing wrong with the album it really only has a couple good songs on it but another CD to buy would be Everclear's new CD. If you like The Offspring than I think this CD should be your next purchase. The song makes me dance whenever it comes on."
5,Can't beat Offspring,"I love Offspring. I only have one album(Americana) but I really want Offspring(self- titled),Ignition, Ixnay on The Hombray, and Smash. But this CD Rocked and it blew all the other new albums away. I want to tell why this album was good:Dexter Holland vocals were funny, angry and even sad. He expressed his music for whatever emotion he had. Noodles played a great electric guitar in ""Pretty Fly(For a White Guy)"" and ""The Kids Aren't Alright"". The guitars in the Offspring band were excellent because they were heavy and down right loud. The percusion was always on beat from Ron Welty and also played very well. I didn't hear much bass from Greg K but didn' effect any song.Go out and by this album now!!!"
4,"Good, But Not As Good As Most People Say It Is","This CD is sort of overrated. Many people say that it is the best Offspring CD ever released, but many of the band's other albums are better than this. Ixnay On The Hombre, Smash, and Splinter (their most recent release) are all better than Americana (in my opinion). ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" is also one of the most overplayed songs on the radio. The CD is still good though. Standout tracks include ""Have You Ever"", ""Starring At The Sun"", ""End of The Line"", and the CD's title track ""Americana"". Also on this CD is the powerful and very emotional track ""Feelings"". I actually got really pissed off after I listened to that song a few times over. This CD is definetely worth the purchase, its just not definetely not The Offspring's best."
2,"Good, but poppy","I know, or assume, that most people who own this album, are people who breath MTV, listen to the top 40, and had a good laugh at Pretty Fly. That is why I am so discouraged.I've always loved bands that made music for a specific type of person (a good example is Radiohead) and Offspring used to be one of those bands. They made music for any teenage kid who didn't care what other people thought of them. This is one of the reasons I loved The Offspring. But with this album they sent their music to the homes of tennyboppers all over the country.So, I gave the extra star for the amazing song ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" (which most pop loving kids probably won't notice) but other than that, I'm dissapointed."
2,Buy Smash or Ixnay unless you are just trendy,I was dissapointed in this album I expected such great things. The Offspring even said that Pretty Fly for a Whiteguy was a mistake. Even people who never heard of the Offspring before love them now. It's sad really. Buy Smash and leave this one for the trendy wannabes.
2,dont buy it buy smash,their used to be a cool punk band called the offspring now they just suck they sound like a pop band greenday also theyve gone soft but atleast not pop like the offspring have i am looking for new punk bands if u like old offspring try pennywise they just came out with a new cd but their was a few good songs americana the kids arent alright the end of the line have you ever and pay the man the rest suck
2,A Little Information...,"For all of you out there you love ""Pretty Fly"" (ugh) and think Americana is the greatest Offspring CD of all time (even though most of you probably have never even heard any of the others, like my younger cousin, who tried to tell me it was their first), I will enlighten you: Americana sucks. Sorry to be so blunt. Americana is nowhere near as good as Smash and Ixnay, and if you think Americana is punk rock, you need to do a bit more research. I'll admit, there were a few good songs on this CD, but most were junk. Unlike Smash, which I got in seventh grade and still listen to now, I sat through Americana maybe twice before tossing it on the mess on my floor in disgust (I have a very messy room). Anyway, for the hardcore fan, it's a let down, but OK if you have a huge surplus of money. Or better yet, send some of that surplus to me."
2,From Punk to Pop - A Sad Story,"Early in the 90's, the Offspring released a self titled CD, followed by Ignition -- two fantastic CDs! Then came Smash, which is one of the single best punk records ever. That was followed by Ixnay on the Hombre, which was pretty good. But here comes Americana, filled with pop songs written to make money, but can you blame them? If you're looking for the good stuff you've come to expect from this little punk group, I don't suggest you buy this album."
4,Americana is cool,"First of all, i would just like to say that people don't respect Americana. Just because its offspring, and this album isn't like ixnay or smash, that's a reason to bash it? No. I like this Cd for what it is. Most of the songs are really good. I really think that i got my money's worth on this one. I especially liked No Brakes, Americana, Have You Ever, Staring at the Sun, and Walla Walla- they're all so funny and the Offpsring have a style on this CD that is consistent throughout. This CD hits a bullseye in my book, and even when i do get around to listening to smash or ixnay, i will still respect this CD for what it is, not what it isn't."
3,offspring,"offspring is a real good band, no questions asked. over the trials and tribulations the band has been through in the past decade or so, I think we all should allow the band some lee-way with the album. It may not be the best, but it's entertaining and fun. as an artist, just let them do what they want, and enjoy the music instead of listening to it with only a critical mind. it defeats the purpose of music. thanks for diversifying offspring and not playing the same stuff every other punk band does. punk can be fast and original, and not be 4 chords and a bridge all the time. give it a chance, and if you don't like it, go listen to NOFX (whom i love dearly) and notice how just about every one of their songs is the EXACTLY the same, with a few exceptions. rock on."
4,Its actually hard to rate this,"I don't know exactly how to rate this album...I guess 4 stars will do. This is by far a very diverse album, which features the songs that basically reintroduced the Offspring to the world (Pretty Fly & Why Don't You Get a Job). Now, while those are not necessarily the most involved songs ever, they are fun, but are not the high spots of the album. Have You Ever, Staring At the Sun, The Kids Aren't Alright, Feelings, Americana & Pay The Man are essential listening for the Offspring fan. Everyone of those songs has its own flavor and feeling, and are among the best songs ever written by the band. The album is very much associated with the singles that came with it. Whether you like these songs or not, they are not all this CD is about. The writing is clever, diverse, and unique, and it still holds up today."
2,THIS IS A BAD CD AT BEST,OKAY THIS IS NOT PUNK. IF YOU WANT OFFSPRING JUST BUY SMASH OR THE SELF-TITLED. PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY IS JUST A HORRIBLE POP SONG AS IS WHY DONT YOU GET A JOB. IT GETS TWO STARS INSTEAD OF ONE BECAUSE OF THE KIDS ARENT ALRIGHT AND AMERICANA WHICH KIND OF REMINDS ME OF THEIR SONG BAD HABIT. DONT BUY THIS.
4,..............................,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST OFFSPRING CD EVER,IMEAN,""SHES GOT ISSUES"" AND ""WHY DONT YA GET A JOB"" ARE THE WORST SONGS EVER. ITS ONLY SAVING GRACE IS ""HAVE U EVER"" AND ""AMERICANA"" AND ""THE END OF THE LINE"". DONT GET ME WRONG, I LOVE ROCK BUT THIS ALBUM DISGRACES THE OFFSPRING'S WORK, OH WELL, MAYBE THEIR NEXT ALBUM,""IN CONVERSATION"" WILL BE MORE ROCK AND LESS POP. OVERALL, FAR TOO POPPY"
2,Dont Buy this Cd,"The Offspring are,a great band,but this is their worst cd its too alternative,so dont buy this people."
2,I wouldn't buy this,"I bought this cd about a year ago, as I was listening to it, I thaught that it was crap and not to compare with the old stuff of The Offspring like Ignition or Ixnay on the Hombre. But after listening it about 20 times I think that it isn't so bad, it's a funny rock CD. Americana can't be compared with Offspring, Ignition, Smash and Ixnay of the Hombre."
1,I didn't like it,I didn't like it because it only had one good song now South Park is a good CD I recommend that CD anyday over this one it stunk. Someone should wave a skunk in front of this CD.
5,SECOND BEST ALBUM EVER RELEASED,"THE BEST ALBUM EVER RELEASED WAS OF COURSE ""SMASH"". THIS CD JUST FALLS SHORT OF THE COMPILATION OF SONGS THE OFFSPRING BROUGHT TO US IN ""SMASH"". HOWEVER ONCE AGAIN THE BAND HAS COMPILED A GROUP OF SONGS THAT HAVE BEAT AND RYTHYM THAT EVERYONE CAN ENJOY AND A MEANING THAT ONLY HALF OF US CAN UNDERSTAND. A COUPLE OF THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM HAVE LITTLE DEPTH TO THEM SUCH AS ""PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY"". HOWEVER OTHER SONGS SUCH AS ""HAVE YOU EVER"", ""NO BRAKES"", AND THE ""THE KIDS AREN'T ALRIGHT"" EXPLORE THE INNER OFFSPRING MORE AND TELL US WHAT THEY ARE ALL ABOUT, WHAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT. I BELIEVE THAT THEIR SONGS CAN ONLY BE FULLY UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME AS THEM. THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NOT WILL BE THINKING WHAT THE HELL AM I TALKING ABOUT WHILST THOSE WHO HAVE WILL ALREADY KNOW. MY FOVOURITE SONG IN THIS ALBUM IS ""NO BRAKES""."
1,one way down a dead end road.,"it's sad, really. I did, regretablly, discover Offspring from ""Pretty Fly"", and I went out and got this album for that song and ""Why Don't You Get A Job?"" (and this was back before they both really hit it big!). that was when I discovered what Offspring was really about. and, most of the other songs on Americana were much better than Pretty Fly and WDYGAJ. now, looking back, now that I have almost all of their albums (missing only the first, self-titled CD), I can say that, of what I've heard, Americana is the weakest of their albums. there are three songs I can still listen to: Have You Ever, Staring At The Sun, and Walla Walla. I can truley only descibe this album as a great band getting back up and running into a wall. 'tis a shame. if you liked Ignition (average), Smash (great), and Ixnay On The Hombre (great), then don't get this one. they used to rock. they don't anymore. period."
5,Americana is the best cd Offsping has made!,Like I said Americana is the best cd Offspring has made. If you listen to it over and over again you will never get tired of it. But I still think that Smash is a pretty good cd.
3,it rocks,"JFKNERINKDNMC,HJFIORNJ FVRFN RNF NF N FJF JFNG FJK JN JKF G JFGHKL F J HJKF GJK HK HF J FJF NMRO CVNRNVRIN HRGLFMNV R O IJGRGJ GIRJ G JIFJ JGIFJ J JI48948 RUOW R AANCVN FJAKNT RKN RIVFN I GFK DJN FRION I F JF JHGF IRITR A MVM PEKASD PW,D SKDP DKK ADF FN FNK F KFKFIRU A A JDFK FJS FJKF JC CKJIOWIIW R E EE J J JSDKADF DFKDJ DJKNFDJKF DJFKCM XMZL W DKFJDK JKLDSJKF DFDKJF IRUWO A A JDKA J DSJF FDJA"
4,Several nice songs,"I liked several of the songs on this CD. My two favorites, though, were ""Pay the Man"" and ""End of the Line"". I dunno why, really, I just liked them a lot. I really can't stand Pretty Fly For a White Guy, and I used to like ""Why don't you get a job?"" and ""The kids aren't alright"" until they started playing them over and over on the radio. That always manges to really screw up a song, doesn't it? But hey, I like most of the songs, whether they're classified in punk rock or not really doesn't matter to me. If you like them, who cares, right?"
3,"Okay CD, Smash is so much better","This CD is average. The best song on it is, ""The Kids Aren't Alright."" But if you want a really great CD, buy Smash. (Ignition is pretty good too.) Sorry to write practically the same thing as a lot of reviews before this, but it is true! So, buy Smash, then Ignition, and if you still have extra money buy Americana."
4,A Great Album,"I am a long time Offspring fan, and I pretty much loved what I heard from Americana. While we are now all sick of Pretty Fly, there are many other great songs. Especially ""The Kid's Aren't Alright"" . When you pop this in the computer, there are also some other cool features, and you can watch four of their older videos, (The meaning of life, All I want, I choose, and Gone Away which is my personal favorite Offspring song). If you buy this CD you won't be disappointed, but, The Offspring's Smash and Ixnay on the Hombre are better, but not by a hell of a lot."
3,Mixed bag.,"Americana by The Offspring is a good album but not as clever as Smash. The Offspring mix silly punk songs with deep rock tracks. Pretty Fly for a White Guy, She's Got Issues, Feelings, and The Kids Aren't Alright are the standouts. Ok album but could've been stronger. Like the album cover though!"
2,DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The only STANDOUT song is ""Walla walla.""WELCOME///(2/10)BAD INTRO.HAVE YOU EVER///(7/10)WEIRD SONG,BUT PRETTY GOOD.STARRING AT THE SUN///(9/10)NOT MUCH TO SAY.I WILL SAY NO MORE."
2,offspring cheated us,I don't know what this was but it wasn't offspring and all of you people who claim to be offspring fans by listening to pretty fly just suck
2,To Whichever Teenie-Boppers this may concern:,"This is NOT an Offspring CD. Get Smash or Ignition instead. If you don't own any Offspring CDs except this one by now, you are IGNORANT! Please, if you first heard about them from MTV, buy Smash and discover MUSIC for the first time. I give the Offspring credit for The Kids Aren't Allright and Feelings. Those tracks rock, and that was the sole reason that I gave the CD two stars instead of one, but face it, the Offspring went commercial and sold out."
1,Did somebody say Sellout?,"I first was introduced to Offspring when I heard Smash at my freinds house. I loved it, it was the best music I had ever heard. So i said to myself ""I need their thers"". I whent to the store a while later and got Ixnae on the Hombre. I loved that cd to. It wasn't as good as Smash but it was great. Then a long while later Americana was in stores. I bought it immediatly. I loved it for a week. Then it clicked that it sounded nothing like the previouse albums. It sounded like pop, it was pop, not the hardcore thrash metal that I was used to. If your one of those teenie pop fans who likes bad music get Americana otherwise get real Offspring like Smash or Ixnay. I can't beleive these guys. One second their the best the other they're sellouts! maybe next time they won't just think about the money, and they will make music that real, loyal Offspring fans will enjoy. Maybe this was just a fluke."
1,The worst Offspring cd made,"This is, in my opinion, the worst Offspring cd that they have ever recorded! It's become too mainstream rock and I guess pop-ish. This cd totally destroyed my taste for the Offspring as well. Pretty Fly for a White Guy (in case you don't know, it's one of their more popular songs from this album...I didn't like it though) was just such a joke. It seemed like they tried to change their style of music in order to actract people that were more into other styles of music instead of just the punk-rock crowd. Its hard to explain...just don't make this the first Offspring cd that you buy."
4,Great heavy metal stuff,I thought that the best song was PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY.I like words alot and it took a few moments to get to the words.But it is a GREAT C.D.
1,"I hate this CD, pure crap",This cd is pure sellout. There is at most 2 good songs. I think that dexter should give it up with his sellout bulls**t and tend more towards nitro where real punk is.
1,don't buy it,"In the words of Limp Bizkit's Wes Borland ""You laughed, you cried, you just kissed you 15 bucks GOODBYE!"" that describes the album."
2,Erratic,"If I took the three or four good songs The Offspring manage to pack onto every release, I'd have a killer 12-track CD. Unfortunately, while Americana has a few high points (notably ""Get A Job"", ""Walla Walla"" and ""She's Got Issues""), the rest of the album veers from the marginally listenable to the irredeemably awful (try tuneless, clueless, and monotonous).These guys seem capable of putting a decent tune together when they try - a pity they content themselves with thrash-fuelled filler seventy percent of the time."
2,it's not that good,"I only found two songs off the CD that I like,(""pretty fly for a white guy"", and ""why dont you get a job?"")"
2,"It could use some work, its a new style for The Offspring.","The Offspring have entered a new style of music than what I've come to expect from them. This is a daring move but I think that if they are daring enough to try it, More power to them!!!!!"
2,Not the Offsprings best work,"I bought americana around the time it came out. I listened to it for a while and I really liked it but after 6 months I got smash and then ixnay right after it. I liked those so much I stopped listining to americana because I realized that americana was pop music. Sometimes I still listen to americana because some songs are good, thats why i gave it 2 stars. I just ordered Ignition and I hope its good. And will someone please tell the offspring to go back to the way they used to be."
2,Not Americana,"The Offspring prides itself from removing its music from the ""poison"" of pop. However, their latest effort, ""Americana,"" is not only pop, but an embarrassment of its incarnation. The album is filled with tiresome vocal delivery, an attribute so important in the success of their earlier sets, ""Ixnay on the Hombre"" and ""Smash."" Though ""Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)"" serves its purpose, the only saving grace of ""Americana"" is ""The Kids Aren't Alright,"" an 80's metal-fused, power anthem. In the end, ""Americana"" isn't Americana. At least, let's hope not..."
5,Realllllyyyyyy cool,"This has got to be the best cd I have ever had even though the song feelings can get boring, number 3-4-5-8-10 r the best for my opinion. definetaly recommended."
4,This C.D. kicks butt!!!,"Offspring has made some good C.D.s and this is one of them!!Not as good as ""SMASH"" but, okay. I hope the next C.D. is better.The Offspring is my #2 favorite band, KORN is #1."
5,Give it to me baby!!!,This CD kicks. All the songs are good. It's a miracle that a CD can not have one suck song! The music video for pretty fly is classical. Walla Walla!!!!
3,Its an Improvement,"actually i would've given it 3 and a half, i've been a fan since ignition and this album(unlike the other reviews) isn't the best, but its the best ""modern"" offspring there is. If a band could sellout any better, then get this CD. u get the point.Ixnay would be the worst, and Smash the best, offspring and ignition right under smash, coming close. i'm a fan of the old cynical offspring.at least the lyrics have a excellent message."
1,Offspring used to be good,"I think that Offspring used to be good but they changed their style to be more popular. If you want a real CD from this style of music Get Nofx, White Trash two heebs and a been. Offspring was good until they went to the new record label. If you insist on being popular and getting an Offspring Cd get SMASH."
3,Can You Say Beasties?,"A lovely array of male pop-rock, but sounds suspiciously like their predecesors, the ageless Beastie Boys."
1,My Worst Album of 1998,"I've listenened to this CD a million times because by manager plays it incessantly at work, and I have to say I can only distinctly recall maybe three or four tracks. It all sounds the same! It's all wailing and four-chord madness! I was sort of impressed the first time I heard their version of ""Feelings"" but pretty soon it all melted down into the same old furious drudgery. Only the Offspring are capable of this low."
4,It isn't the best BUT it's okay,"The Offspring has good lyrics but not very good tunes. There's only a couple of songs with good tunes: Have You Ever, Pretty Fly, The Kids Aren't Alright, Walla Walla and Why don't you get a job. 5 songs, that's not even the whole CD. Another thing about this album is Pay The Man is 10 minutes! (and it also suckes) They should of made 2, 5 minutes songs insted of a 10 minute song. The end of Pay The Man has a stupid very short version of Pretty Fly. Offspring did okay BUT it's not the best."
3,It's Offspring alright...,"Not so much different from Smash, except Smash is better in terms of its hype."
4,It was excelent for people my age,"Sure the cd may be a little immature but the kind of music they play is worth listening to.The cd is definately not for everyone,but if your into punk and alternative it should be on your list."
4,The offspring cd was pretty cool.,"Offspring has written a lot of songs but I think one of the best is ""Walla Walla"" I also like ""pretty fly (for a white guy). It is all pretty cool exept one song, ""Why don't you get a job"" I hate that song!. Otherwise it's a cool cd."
3,Be a part of gay and sporting history with this documentary.,"You've all heard of them. You all know the most recent ones were inSydney. And hopefully you're all wondering what they're all about. It'sthe Gay Games, the world's most inclusive sporting event, and thisdocumentary is an in depth look at the eight days, 31 sports, and 12,000participants of the Gay Games VI-Sydney.This documentary is uplifting. The participants in--and the meaningbehind-- the Gay Games are changing and reinventing both history andsporting events as a whole. It shows clips from all of the differentsporting events and has heartfelt interviews with many of itsparticipators. Though the filming is not spectacular, it's the bestdocumentation of the Gay Games to date, and it absolutely made me want tobe a part of them. Buy this documentary and buy a piece of queer andsporting history"
2,Not Worth The Money,"If this is the 'most comprehensive collection' of the Gay Games, the Games committee needs to reevaluate spending the money on video taping. The DVD menu selection, however hard the editors tried to make it interactive, doesn't do a very good job. The ""highlights"" of the games are simply that, extremely short snipets of the games. There are interviews intertwined throughout - which I'm guessing are the only fools that would agree to be on video. It's a sporting event - show sporting activities. The panning of someone's crotch is not what the Gay Games is about. And if you wanted to go that route, pan more crotchs and worthwhile ones at that! This video is 'okay', but I would have enjoyed a more, A LOT more comprehensive video of the Gay Games from start to finish. (By the way, the slideshow - way too slow and there's no way to view the pictures faster.)"
4,"Very good, but not quite as good as Domingo-Scotto","What a luxury--to have two videos of FRANCESCA DA RIMINI! This one is quite good, both Dessi and Armiliato are in good voice, the sets are striking and well done. If this were the only Francesca available, I'd be very pleased. But the competition is the classic Domingo-Scotto-MacNeill, which is hard to beat. Still, I'm delighted to have this one, as well."
2,The leftover slime lasts forever!,"This was great fun for us. However, please be smarter than me and don't use it in a high-traffic area of your yard. Your best bet would be to put a trash bag or large piece of plastic down to play on. We just mixed it and poured it in the grass and within a week it was the slipperiest slime ever that lasted about 2 months! I would buy it again, but I would mix it and pour it onto something that can be easily disposed of!"
4,Scientific Fun,"I used super snow during a science lesson about polymers. This particular lesson focused on some of the strange things you can do with these unusual meolecular bonds. I was able to give students 1/8tsp of the snow powder, which is mixed with water, in a small ziplock bag. Students shook the bags vigrously for about 2.5 minutes and they had a handful of snow. The ""flakes"" are spherical and sticky and you can control the texture by slightly altering the water/powder ratio. This experiment and one where we put a wooden skewer through a balloon were the most popular. The students are in grades 5-8."
2,Sticky stuff,"This was not what I expected at all, its granules of silicone type stuff which makes the most unbelievable mess. However,the kids however loved it! (They've never seen the real stuff.) I got fed up with cleaning them off and my kitchen surfaces and hid it in the cupboard in the end. Save it for summer in the yard or deck! Yuck!"
5,Tone Port,Great product with near zero latency. For anyone else who needs info on Mac compatibility check here. http://www.line6.com/toneportux1/
3,"Okay, but not really good","Got it and returned it the same day. The control knobs were flimsy with very little headroom. Set up was okay, the sounds were good and it functioned well as a sound card. Had the knobs offered better control, I probably would have kept it."
3,First Time Author,"I am naturally going to be biased because Christina and I are internet buddies. And in actuality the rating would have been better if her editor had left well enough alone, or had gotten someone to proofread it who actually knew English. The story is well thought-out. It actually leads you on for quite a while, where you aren't sure what the point is, until the surprise revelation at the end. She's got that skill down pat. The only thing that will really turn you off is the bad work of the editor. There are numerous places where he took out punctuation and changed words a bit, such as using the spelling ""it's"" instead of ""its"" (which happens a lot). But if you can get past that, it's an enjoyable read for an evening."
4,Tasty Palet Pleaser,Rain Forest Nut is one of my top coffee treats. It's been a good while since I have found such a coffee treat. Love the smooth slightly nutty flavor. It is not too strong and offers a nice coffee pick me up.
2,"Not bad, but flawed execution","I like the flexiblility of getting them out and the shape is great, but with nothing rigid, placing a filled bar in the freezer is very delicate"
2,OK,"They work alright, but initially they're really hard to fill. It's hard not to overfill them, and once you do, it's impossible to pour out part of the water. The whole thing wants to go at once. Also very flimsy so getting them in the freezer is challenging.Too small to really be useful. I guess they're ok if you're just looking to add a little chill, or if you are drinking out of very thin water bottles."
2,Silicon bottle ice tray too floppy,"I got this bottle ice tray thinking it would be a great way to put ice into drink containers with narrow necks. The idea is great, and there are some products that can make the bottle ice, but this silicon tray isn't one (at least not for me). I found the tray too floppy to handle, both empty and full, and the long narrow indentations were too shallow to make good bottle ice."
1,Not very stable,"This product only works if you have a flat service and can pour water into it while in the freezer. Otherwise, it is very easy to spill while trying to put it into the freezer."
4,Vanden Plas - The God Thing: A Dream Theater Clone?,"After hearing the God Thing for the first time, I'm reminded strongly of Dream Theater. The keyboards, drums and guitar have strong similarities to Dream Theater (think Images & Words or Awake).But after subsequent listens, other similarities stand out on this excellent cd. I find that the guitar actually reminds me of Dokken and Conception just as much as it does Dream Theater. The vocals remind me of Conception, too. Though Vanden Plas's vocalist has a higher range than does Roy S. Khan of Conception, they both have similar voices. The music is strong and powerful and Vanden Plas concentrates on writing great songs rather than self-indulgent technical silliness. This is where Vanden Plas has the potential to be superior to Dream Theater, they (Vanden Plas) know what music is about.Progressive metal is about musical innovation, not technical masturbation.If you like Dream Theater and Conception, I think you may like Vanden Plas."
5,Key position in Classical period musician,"Recently I listen the so-called early music, from renaissance period to baroque period music, I find even on instrument change, or composition content, it would be gradually growing and deleloping to more abundance for me. So when I listen Cannabich, it's easy to me understand what classical period music it was, and why it looks like it.If you ever listenned the germanic court music, ex Biber,Bach. And pick up classical period music, Hayden, Mozart to compare. You would understand the picture of Connabich, and find his intermedia role.Besides, Naxos again offer a cheaper but valuable CD to us, I recommand it to all"
3,thoroughly researched,"The work was well researched into even the smallest details, and counterchecked...a huge effort! And perhaps based on that, Jim Teal seems to believe he knew Livingstone as well as Livingstone himself, stating his own interpretations of what Livingstone might have thought or felt about some event or decision as if it were a fact, even about deep and complex psychological issues. One has to respect what early explorers survived to complete the trips they made, and to influence history. I was awed, but still, I found the reading depressing."
3,good for before bed,"This book is great before bed, you will be asleep quickly after a few pages. Not too stimulating but still a good story and comprehensive."
5,My favorite photo book ever.,"I've owned a lot of photo books, all which have provided me inspiration in my journey as a photographer, but nothing compares to this title, which I have revisited over and over again over the last twenty+ years. Bill is not only a great photographer who does things with light and film that others only dream of, but also expresses a personal insight into the process that has proved invaluable. If photography for you is an obsession and not just a passion, if you want to learn to tell a story and not just make another pretty picture, this is a book that has to be at hands reach. I'm rereading it again this weekend and I can honestly say that I'll probably derive something new from it yet again that I didn't pick up the last time I read it. That's what a great book should be and this certainly fits the bill."
2,A lecture. Highly technical.,"I've been building a library about global warming and climate change. I'm not into this professionally but I'm a concerned amateur teaching a course on the subject to other seniors. ""Saul Griffith"" is a highly technical lecture that is of no use to me or to my course, although the book may be useful to professionals in the subject matter."
5,"The ""Bible"" of Celtic Research","If you only buy one book on Celtic culture, make it this one. I've already worn out two copies. Indespensible material on the background and basis of Celtic mythology. Absolutely necessary to understanding the Celtic world view. Definitely not New Age fluffy bunny by a LONG shot. Advanced work and well worth the reading."
4,Solid reading for those who want to explore the culture,"If you have already read some of the medieval sagas of Ireland and Wales (like the Tain or the Mabinogi) and you want to know more about the cultures that gave birth to those tales, then this is the book for you. Although this classic volume is not recent, its content remains factual, reliable, and fascinating. This is not a book to be read at one sitting. Give yourself time to consider each chapter carefully. Perhaps you'll want to read or reread some of the tales before going on. For those who follow this approach, this book can be a source of inspiration as well as information."
2,dull & boring read; suited to scholarly types only,"After a trip to Ireland & Scotland this spring, I thought it would be interesting to find out about Irish & Scottish history, mythology, etc. This book is a discussion of Irish & Welsh myths. It is lacking in actual texts of stories. Instead it contains (at least the parts that I have read) only condensed, abbreviated forms of these tales with all of the exciting storytelling taken out. The authors did, however, give a good enough description of the storytelling culture to make me want to go back and hear the original stories (if there are still any storytellers left). Overall, I would suggest finding something a little more interesting, although this might be useful for someone performing research on the topic."
3,Fried Doesn't include Venona Intercepts,"This is a valuable review of numerous documents from the era that is commonly referred to as ""McCarthyism"", and as a record of actual documented history, it is valuable. However, it was published one and one-half years after the release of the Venona intercepts between the Soviet KGB Secret Service and its American Citizens that were spies, frequently paid, for the Soviet Union and Stalin. Therefore, the opinions expressed, mostly liberal, regarding the documentation presentated in this book, are, at best, dated. At worst, it is a continuing disregard of actual events and the true history of that fascinating time period, when there were hundreds of American Traitors in the US Government."
1,What About the Venona Transcripts?McCarthy was Right,"For decades Leftists mourned the deaths of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, their son, Meerpool, established a foundation to perserve their memory. For decades Meerpool sought to prove their innocence. Every member of the Democratic party and the entire Left elitist crowd claimed injustice. Then, the Venona transcripts were declassified. The Venona transcripts were the word by word communications between the Soviet Union and its agents in the United States. Those agents were exactly the people McCarthy and Hoover had identified. Julius and Ethel transmitted nuclear secrets that put our country at risk of nuclear attack. Alger Hiss, the Harvard aristocrat, was confirmed as a Soviety Spy. Whittake Chambers and McCarthy were correct."
1,Low quality,"The keyboard died after 1 year of very very VERY light use. It is my second M-Audio keyboard that let me down. I do not buy keyboards from m-audio anymore. If one needs disposable keyboard, there are cheaper alternatives."
3,It works well WHEN it works,I bought my Axiom 49 on November 22 from Amazon... it worked fine up till December 26th... I was able to make a couple demos with it before the screen when blank and it stopped communicating with my laptop. This happened all of a sudden and all indications are (from the M-Audio forum) that this is a manufacture's defect. I am in the process of returning this item to Amazon for an exchange; I hope this process goes smoothly. I will let you all know how it goes!
4,Good Product for Hobbyist,"I've had this for about three weeks now and I am very happy with it. I am using it with GarageBand and it works seemlessly with that program. The weighted keys are nice to the touch although they obviously don't feel like a real piano. The drum pads are a nice addition as well. The touch sensitivity works well also and is adjustable according to your style of play.My only compliant is that it looks like it would take a long time to program the controllers (knobs and presets) on this keyboard to work with the software program you are using. I haven't tried it yet becuase when i read through the manual i immediately thought (well i don't have time to go through all of this right now"" It may be me, but I wish this process were easier.I would say this is a quality product for the price and seems like it has the potential to be used for more advanced settings if you get to that level."
1,Dissappointed,This was ordered as a xmas gift for a child and it didn't come with all the.connections and wiring necessary to function.
4,Great Product but....,"i am very happy with this midi controller, it works great and sounds great. It was shipped relatively quickly and it was a good price compared going to Guitar Center or any other music store! Only issues i have with it, the ableton live is kinda difficult to use right out of the box, you really have put your head into the book to learn to use its features or even get sound from it! i gave it enough time trying to pick it up on the fly, but after one night i gave up and now i use garage band for my sounds."
2,Worked great until it broke,Warranty's expired. Oh well. Another $250 pissed down the drain.Maybe an Akai unit will last longer.
1,Worthless. BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I bought this less than a year ago. I have a top of the line computer, and am pretty savvy at using it. I didn't use the AXIOM 49 for more than a few times before I got the ""blank blue screen of death."" For the THREE times I used it, it's now turned out to be one expensive paperweight. It constantly had problems with the drivers, which I had to reload, and reload, and reload.... by the time I seemed to get it working, I didn't really feel like recording anymore... not that it mattered, since it would randomly stop working. So, M-Audio requires that I spend more money to ship it to them (so they can swap it out with a ""refurbished model"" that will probably stop working after a few days. I really wish I'd never bought this pretty little piece of junk.The relatively low price point benefit really goes away in hindsight. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Great product,Very happy with purchase of this prodcut! Received it quickly and the product works as expected. I would definitely recommend this to others.
3,Good but not Epic,"I read reviews that this film was boring and almost did not watch it. It was not boring at all and the 2 1/2 hours went by fast. Lots of action. Depp was great as Dillinger. The problem with this movie is it was mostly action*bank robberies, etc) yet lacking a deep connection to people in the film. I would have liked to have seen more of Depp and Marion together.The movie is too dark that its very annoying and it gets very low and then loud..A good movie, great actors, Mann could have made it great but failed too.If you are a Depp fan you'll love him in this."
3,Just Okay,"This historical drama of the FBI vs. Dilinger had so much more potential than what ended up as ""Public Enemies."" It was a decent movie that kept me awake, but the storyline was flat. Also, there wasn't much character development for either the gangsters or the G-men. Disappointing."
4,Depp and Bale make it work,Public Enemies is about the life of Ganster John Dillinger. It does an fantastic job of portraying John Dillinger's life on the big screen. Supported by an all-star cast of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Both of these actors deliver an all-star performance.Public Enemies is very entertaining and keeps your interest through the whole movie!
4,Very good gangster movie,"This was a well paced movie with good action and good acting. Johnny Deep was good as Dillenger and Bale really fit his role well. The other crooks were mean, tough, and bad - just like you want them. The sets, especially the banks, really brought you back to the 1930s. If you are a gun fan, there is a lot of Thompson and BAR action galore. Crank up your surround sound.I'm a Micheal Mann fan but this didn't seem to have the same feel as some of his other work. Maybe he was trying something different. In any case, it works.I'm not a fan of movies over 2 hours, but this kept my interest."
1,Blu Ray Disc Does Not Work even after updates & different players.,Plain & simple this Blu Ray Disc did NOT work on my Blu Ray Samsung & LG players even after both machines had been updated. I tried two different Blu Ray copies of this movie & both failed. I guess I will have to settle for a plain old DVD.
1,Oh Dear Me!,"i have to say. I love, love, both Johnny Depp and Christian Bale but have to say this is one of the films I actually turned off before the end. Sorely disappointed. Nothing more I can really say.... the Blu Ray was good but boo hoo for the rest of the film was rubbish."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"This movie is very slow and terribly boring. In places the sound was too low to hear properly. And, like too many new movies there was far too much shakey camera. All shakey camera movies get a one star from me. If I could, I'd give them a zero! I shall not be watching this again, so I wasted $30."
1,Suck City....,"Man, Does Mann Owe Us ...........Took Our Moolah On This One............Faith Ain't Worth A Flip Any More....He Got His Money.We Got Suckered..!....No Wonder Depp Lives In France......Can't Smell The Stench From There..!"
2,Not sure how best to rate this,"This movie is very good... it was definitely worth watching... or so I thought until it came to the ending. If you aren't the type to judge a movie by the whole of it, than this choice would not be one of your bad ones. Unfortunately, the ending was entirely too anticlimactic for my liking and more or less ruined it for me. Johnny Depp is very entertaining, and there was nothing wrong with the acting in this movie... all things considered, no complaints."
2,Hang Fire,"Unenvolving, unemotional, no drama. Where gangsters ever so boring? Example: at the beginning of the film guys escape from prison. FREEDOM! But are they estatic, laughing, horsing around? Nope, just blank statues. I have more emotion leaving work on Friday afternoon. There should be the extreme highs of pulling off a robbery along with the extreme lows of constantly being hunted, the constant nagging thought of being ambushed by the law at any moment, all mixed with a overiding desperation of a life shoved into smaller and smaller corners. If the characters aren't feeling it, why should I?"
2,"Sappy, wimpy and boring","Traditionally, I'd give this movie a longer review, but since I was so incensed at the meandering plot and not-so-compelling character developments, I'll wrap it up with this: Skip this movie."
3,Johnny Depp,"I was really looking forward to this movie. There was a lot of action, but in the telling of a true story, there's not much room to entertain. It was a little disappointing to me."
2,Not so great.,"I'm not saying the acting isn't good, but honestly this movie just doesn't work. I never cared much for Dillinger character or his love interest. I never cared if Pervous quit the FBI. Simply a matter of waiting until the last man got shot and history class already told me who, where and how. Just a movie that misses the mark."
4,Excellent film minus historical inaccuracies,"This is a great film. Historians will be quick to shoot holes through it however. The video and sound quality are excellent, especially with the Otis Taylor banjo working beautifully. I would have loved for Mann to put in an accurate scene when Nelson was killed (a remarkable story in itself), and a little more back story involving their pairing as well as Karpis. I was disappointed having read the book first, but still loved the film. If Mann had taken the time to tell this story more accurately (probably a 3-4hour undertaking), I would have given it a 5 star. I did appreciate him filming scenes at Little Bohemia and the prison Dillinger escaped from. Depp does an excellent job, and captures the essence of Dillinger in my opinion. Bale also puts on a great performance, but lacked to convey the incredible stress Purvis was under from Hoover. The special features aren't skimped out on either. A great yet inaccurate film of Public Enemy number 1."
4,A film that drips quality but has some notable flaws,"Most of this film works incredibly well. The period piece feel is completely effective, and Johnny Depp is compelling and watchable as Dillinger. I felt Christian Bale's performance was well judged, as he played a man who was a bit of a weasel but it's not how we're used to seeing Bale.For the rest of the cast, Stephen Graham stands out. The violence and setpieces are well done, some of the best I've seen.The flaws are in some aspects of the narrative, which flags in places, and that some confusion on minor points can arise. But overall this is good cinema and well worth seeing.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Adequate but Uninspired,"Public Enemies, directed by Michael Mann, and starring Johnny Depp as John Dillinger and Christian Bale as G-man Melvin Purvis, is a sturdy and basic film without venturing too far into the showy or flashy realms. The acting is adequate but not inspired. The dialogue is not bad, but not very memorable, either. Gun fights and car chases go on far too long. Although mostly entertaining, the running time at 2 hours, 20 minutes is about half an hour too long - we know that Dillinger will get shot outside a Chicago movie theater, so there's little suspense in the last half hour. Okay, but never quite breaks through to the ""really good"" category."
3,Dillinger Saga Lacks Dramatic Firepower,"Director Michael Mann tries to give ""Public Enemies"" an epic texture comparable to his 1995 masterwork ""Heat."" Unfortunately, this well-made yet narratively thin retelling of John Dillinger's 1933-34 crime spree cannot sustain its 140-minute length. The vigorous shootouts and Depression-era period detail remain impressive, but the dramatic impact is oddly subdued. Despite this drawback, there's plenty of star power from Johnny Depp's Dillinger and Christian Bale's Melvin Purvis - both ideally cast in the classic tradition. Though a noble effort, ""Public Enemies"" does not represent Mann at his best."
3,"The B.A.R., the Thompson, and lots & lots of bullets....","This film is over two hours long and if you removed all the dialogue it would probably still be two hours long, and after a while it begins to seem quite long, because it's another retelling of the story of another real-life gangster who gets what he has coming, and frankly they didn't need an actor of the caliber of Johnny Depp to handle the scant material he is provided with in this film.Personally, I thought Thief more interesting."
2,Disappointing Video Quality,Already have a DVD of this movie...bought the Blu ray for the improved video quality.Very disappointed. The video quality of this Blu ray is worse than my DVD (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV).Skip this one if you are looking for improved video quality.
1,Costume Department Priority,"It seems that the biggest priority in Public Enemies was to ensure that the overcoats worn by the male cast looked good on camera.Lots of fake looking sets (prison wall, farmhouse etc) hey but the overcoats look great.Lots of inaubible scenes but hey don't the actors look great in those overcoats......Sadly disappointing."
1,LONG AND BORING !!!,"When I rented this movie, I was expecting to see a good ole' fashion ganster mafia movie that is set in 1933. When you have a cast with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, you can't go wrong. I WAS WRONG!!! There was way to much talking and not enough action!!!"
5,"Its not where you came from, its where your going that counts.",Great movie. Probably pretty true to life as to how things went down back then. Violence and a love story combined. Gimme zee cash!!!!
5,Johnny Depp,"Great, Great, Johnny does a great job in this film. Plays John Dillinger very well. A little sad that the filming wasn't shot more in the places where they really took place. All in All Good Movie."
3,gangster flick,not one of Depp's best efforts but well made never the less. interesting story however. la dee dah dee dah
5,Interesting Take on Dillinger,"Shipping time was a little long, but Public Enemies arrived within the time frame given.As a review of the movie, it's definately a very interesting, expressionistic take on the John Dillinger case. Not often do you see this type of directing and the type of feel that this movie emits in an organized crime movie. There is some gore, but it's almost cheesy gore (if you're involved in a criminal justic class, you'll almost want to laugh at the gore due to the expressionistic feel the director chose and how inaccurate it seems...)Over all, very good. No scratches, arrived within the time frame. Packaging was good. Me = Happy customer!"
3,Awesome movie. However worst sound quality,"Loved the movie. Saw it a while ago in the theaters. So hubby and I pop some popcorn and settle down to watch! Movie starts. ""can you hear the movie?"" We had to turn the volume up almost as high as the tv would go! NOT THE TV FAULT. Very frustrating. Still had a hard time hearing actors talking. Funny thing..... When we saw this in the theater we got free return tickets for the SAME PROBLEM! So to make sure it wasn't the tv, which we already knew, we put in another movie and blasted our ears....... Sound issues but so sad because this is really a great movie!!!"
5,Must see,Johnnie Depp is a bad @#! in this movie. This is one that you must add to your movie collection.
1,Oh yawn,"If you want to watch a seemingly endless series of fire fights with automatic weapons this is the movie for you. It has Johnny Depp in it, but no movie is perfect. Apart from Depp it is reasonably well acted. The problem is, aside from actors shooting blanks at each other, there is not much here. The movie is at least historical inasmuch as it shows Dillinger being gunned down after watching a movie. I hope whatever he saw was better than this."
2,'Heat' Revisited,"I was pretty disappointed with this film because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale; I also enjoyed the work Michael Mann put into Heat. As I was watching this movie, I simply could not forgive the fact that this movie was just ""Heat in the Depression Era,"" and that's what this movie boils down to. If you want to see Depp and Bale in a movie together, go ahead and rent Public Enemies, but if you're looking for a good film about the cat and mouse game of cops and robbers, save yourself some money on this and watch Heat instead, because Heat did it before and Heat did it better.I've never written one of this reviews before, but I really wanted folks to know what they were getting into with this movie."
3,"Just ok, could have been better","I expected a lot more, love Johnny Depp he must of had to do this with his contract. This is not like the untouchable's or soprano's, somewhat lost my interest"
3,Disappointed,"I adore Johnny Depp's acting style and eagerly awaited the release of Public Enemies. Dillinger's history has always fascinated me and the opportunity to see Depp play this iconic gangster was a thrill I couldn't wait to see. Granted, the movie had great costuming, music, and appeared to be historically accurate. The acting is what led to my bad review. Depp was stellar, as always, but I felt the other actors were a bit stiff and unbelievable in their portrayals. The movie did hold a lot of promise, reaching but never quite touching that realm that would have made it stellar."
2,Disappointing,"I was really expecting a bit more from this movie. The plot was rather hollow, the dialogue was hard to follow at times, and the characters were very one dimensional and uninteresting. Halfway through the movie, I found myself asking ""is it over yet?"" If you really want to see this, I suggest you rent it."
5,Public Enemies,"This movie was very well acted. Johnny Depp as usually was very believeable as John Delinger. This movie is well worth your time.If you enjoy 1930's gangster movies, you will love this one. An extra bonus is that this is a true story and John Delinger really lived!"
5,Johnny Depp fans,"My wife & I like Depp's movies so I bought this one for a Christmas present. It is a glamourized verzion of Dillinger's career but none the less it is a good movie. The acting is pretty good, but just realize that it is fiction. It is a good movie for the price. I did most of my Christmas shopping on Amazon."
5,Time well spent!!!,"I loved this movie; from the story to the setting to the characters, it was wonderful! This movie immersed me into it and somehow made me feel like I was right there. They could not have done a better job of recreating the 30's. Johnny Depp took on the part of Dillinger and he put his whole self into the part ( as usual). I just wanted to keep watching it, but sadly came to an end. I could have sat thru another hour or much more. In all actuality, I suppose I did. As, I ended up watching the commentary and then watched it again. 5+ stars!"
5,HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE JOHNNY DEEP,REALLY ENJOYED THE FILM. MY HUSBANDS CAR WAS IN THE MOVIE SO WE WERE ANXIOUS TO SEE THE SECOND DVD. DEEP'S VERSATILITY REALLY SHOWS THROUGH.
5,Public Enemies Special Edition Blu-ray,"I think this movie was made great. Depp played the character of Dillinger pretty good too. I personally love anything having to do with the original outlaws and gangsters so this movie was awesome. Everything is great about this movie. However for anyone who is a nut like me and really follows time lines, this movie is a little off when it comes to the deaths/murders of some of the other outlaws. In general, the movie is great either was and its one for the collection.... so BUY IT!"
5,action review,great action true story crime film from the 1930's great cast with johnny Depp and Christian Bale the whole cast keeps the film believable and never loses my attention. I suggest this to any fan of action films or true story films.
3,"FAIRLY WELL DONE, BUT DEPP IS JUST SO SO","Public Enemies is a fairly well-done period piece about John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) and other Depression Era gangsters, and how FBI Chief Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) helps to bring about their demise. Decent drama and action by director Michael Mann, but it's hard to get close to the characters, and Depp is just okay in this role. 3-4 Stars. Rated R for violence and language.Waitsel Smith"
4,Getting Dillinger!,"Great movie! Well done, excellent acting, Depp is terrific! I highly recommend it!"
4,Public Enemies,"Good movie, other people say it wasn't that great, don't listen to other people, go buy this movie its worth looking at if not owning."
3,John,This was a great action movie. But I must stop there since many parts of the movie were not factual even though it is about a real person. So high marks for its action but low marks for sticking to history
1,Mann's worst film,Michael Mann put out many great films and this one I had high expectations about. I am even from Chicago and went to the sneak preview! It turned out to be a mess. It was boring and Christian Bale was so bad. He tried to pronounce words and talk like Obama and it was laughable. The slow motion ending at the Biograph Theater was pathetic. The theater I saw it at was packed and yawns were resounding throughout my aisle. I still remember my disappointment today and have to say that it was one of the big bombs by a major director.
3,Not Johnny Depp's Finest Work,"Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger in this shoot 'em up. If you like stories about gangsters, ones that seem to glorify those gangsters, and/or you like Johnny Depp, you will probably appreciate this movie.The date is 1933, the place is Chicago, and much of the story is known from history and pretty predictable. And I'm not one of those who likes to glorify bank robbers and killers. I do love Johnny Depp, though. So it's a movie worth watching, but not all that great."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, however, this movie is just so so. It's very slow and not worth the money or time invested in it."
2,Too bad didn't meet expectations,"Potential was high - great actors/great story content/great director - but didn't make it. The story is disjointed because Mann didn't decide whose story he was going to tell - so he tried to tell them all. Leaving a movie that jumps, leaves actors without being able to fulfull their story. Both Depp and Bale deliver excellent performances, but with their story uncompleted (you need to watch the extra features to understand) they seem missing. Also, by spending time on other characters (Hoover, Pretty boy Floyd, etc.) you don't get to really connect with any character. As usual, the history is manipulated for the movie, but the manipulation doesn't help the movie. It is too bad, some strong acting, but a really hard to follow story."
3,Do Not Adjust Your Set,"It needs to be stated that this BluRay is not of the best quality. Throughout the movie, you will see a disappointing amount of grain. In fact, there are times when the overall image will flicker. I almost thought there was something wrong with my PS3 until I read professional reviews about this disc.The movie: Depp rules as always!"
4,Good movie....but not blu-ray worthy,Great movie - I'm not a gangster fan but I am a Johnny Depp fan (and he looked amazing!). But there were a lot of parts tht were grainy and poor quality for blu-ray. Save a few dollars and get this one on normal DVD.
3,Not what I expected,"Although I am a fan of movies about the gangsters of the Thirties, I was disappointed by this film. While the principles did a good kob depicting their characters, the film was short on the action one would expect considering the subject. It dealt more with the psychology of the opponents, John Dillinger and Melvin Pervis, than with the reasons Dillinger became the folk hero (or anti-hero) he was. The period was a time when the gangsters, especially the bank robbers, were making headlines every day. A good depiction of this is shown in the documentary Crime Wave.Crime Wave: 18 Months of MayhemIn my opinion the two classic films of this genre are Bonnie and ClydeBonnie and Clydeand DillingerDillinger. In the latter Warren Oates, portraying Dillinger, shows exactly why it was so important to stop him. For fans of this genre, it is a much more enjoyable film. While I will keep Public Enemies in my collection, it's not one I will rewatch too many times."
4,Drags a bit but still worth viewing and appreciation,"This films drags a bit here and there, and the characters are not fleshed out a whole lot. Perhaps it would help if we all had a primer on Dillinger, et al. But we must deal with what we are given. Michael Mann knows the criminal mind better than just about anyone else working in film, and we get some glimpses of his insights here. Johnny Depp is wonderful as always, while Christian Bale is solid as the agent hunting him down during the Depression era. The production design is gorgeous, the period recreated perfectly, and the music is unbeatable.This was perhaps unfairly overlooked when in theaters, so now is your chance to catch up."
4,"Johnny Depp, as always, delivers: entertaining and intriguing","I'm a big Johnny Depp fan...both in the ""looks department"" and his acting abilities; he's a strange person...dark/interesting roles seem to find him. I was surprised by how ""normal"" this role was for him, given some of his past movies (Sweeny Todd, Alice in Wonderland, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, Edward Scissorhands....need I name more weird but wonderful roles he's taken on?) but was just as entertaining to watch and he definitely IS ""John Dillinger"" in Public Enemies. The movie and roles are action-packed without being overboard, and you even get a bit of a love story thrown in without it becoming ridiculous or sappy or taking over the whole movie...which is touching and intriguing, given that he is a hard-core outlaw.Take the time and watch this one...I swore I would only watch 30min and get to bed, but I couldn't turn it off!"
1,waste of time,"Save your money!! This dvd is a waste of time to view and a total waste of money to purchase. I'd give it ""0"" stars if I could."
5,The Investor's Guide to Real Security Analysis,"I still pick up my copy and marvel at the relevance of this exceptionally-written book.This book will be beget appreciation from professional and/or passionate fundamental analysts. Meanwhile, this book should be must reading for all young professionals who think that the world is different today and that history has nothing to teach us!"
4,Investing,Still learning every day. A lot of details and research required to get the hang of making good investments. This book will definitely be passed on to my daughter who is studying to be a CFP.
3,Security blanket,"If you can read this book wihtout falling asleep, more power to you. Some of the principals still apply. But a lot of this is so out dated.I made it about half way, then had to put it down. I might pick it up again, but it will be painful.I am sure that in its day, it was prime material, but it has out lived its usefulness."
1,Security Analysis,"It is a book that comes from the 30's and has stayed in the 30's. Being such a technical subject full of quantitative proceedures and techniques, this book disregards it all to focus on qualitative bla bla. This book is all about literature, don't expect to learn any technical insights or even less to see any numbers. One can do much more either with a simple Financal Analysis text or even with Equities tutorials from the web. Don't waste your time and money with this aged and useless book. Just to let you know I am an Equities Portfolio Manager myself."
3,An in-depth way to look at investing from the balance sheet,This book is excellent for anyone wanting to get into the nitty gritty of companies and investing. I would not recommend this book to anyone new to investing or who just wants some general guidelines to follow.
5,WATCH OUT,"This is the dated, as stated 'Classic', edition of the book. The latest edition is the one you may want, not this one. I was not observant enough to realise this...don't make the same mistake. If you know much about finance though you can pick up on which parts are out of date..."
5,Best investing book I've ever read,"Yes, this is the best investing book I've ever read, but I never read the 2nd or 3rd editions so maybe they are better? I do know that the 5th edition is absolutely horrible, it wasn't written by Graham and has nothing to do with this book, and you won't learn anything about investing from reading it.You do need a strong background in accounting to understand this book. There are some archaic accounting terms used in the book that no longer apply today. A law school course in Corporations Law is helful here too.Nevertheless, every more modern book on ""value investing"" never really explained it as well as this book written in 1934.Yes, the book is long, but who said investing should be easy? If you want easy money, go to Vegas. I made hundreds of thousands of dollars in the stock market after I read this book. This book is more valuable than a college education and a lot cheaper."
2,A waste of money,"Go buy the classic 1934 edition. The informal style of the 1934 edition can be easily read and understood by just about anyone. If that one was good enough for Warren Buffet, it's good enough for the rest of us. This latest edition reeks of academic arrogance and is poorly written with points that ramble on forever with no conclusion and examples that make no sense. The 1934 edition has some outdated examples but its concepts and forecasts are so true that you'd swear it was a historical perspective written in recent years."
5,Essential for climbers,"Every climber alive should read ""Accidents"" every year, because it's the best way to learn what you should not do. (For all other climbers, it's too late.) It also makes you aware how easy it is for one tiny slip to become dangerous or fatal, and when those slips are most likely to happen. Besides, it satisfies the morbid curiosity most of us have about other people's accidents at the same time that it serves an educational purpose. Whats not to love about a book like that?"
5,Good value for the money!,"These same cables in Europe cost the equivalent of over $50.00 (US). As I (an American currently living/working in a European country) compared prices here and on Amazon.com, I of course ordered these from Amazon.com, had them sent to my sister who then forwarded on to me with some other things. The savings more than paid for postage. Now they are attached between my HD TV and DVD working perfectly - so very pleased."
3,"Ok, but primitive","Our 6 & 7 year old enjoyed playing this once- and it did take several sessions to get throug it, but I doubt that they will play it again, as it doesn't seem to change w/ each game. The slow play drove me wild, but they didn't seem as bothered by it. For example, when you click on a doorway, to get Max to go there, you don't just go- a voice over says, very slowly, ""should Max go through the doorway into the cellar? Yes [a thumbs up appears]or No [a thumbs down appears]?"", then you click on whichever you want, and the same voice says the choice you made (yes or no), and then you can go through. If you are used to American software it will seem a bit primitive."
2,DID NOT WORK FOR ME,They are very small. My fault for not checking before ordering. I needed them to wrap candy made of Leche Quemada. But these are very small for that. My mistake. Lost time and money.
3,Pecan Meal~~,I have never tried it before. I'm not really sure what I am supposed to do with it. I put a little in my smoothies and plan to use the rest in a low carb cheese cake.
5,What to expect,"If you like Chamillionaire, you won't be dissapointed with this CD. He gives you nothing but the best lyrics Houston has to offer. Alot of the songs are cut short, and DJ Whoo Kidd is extremely annoying in the background yelling and adding alot of gun shots to every song. But overall, Cham can never dissapoint you. Some of my choice songs are, definatley ""Platinum Allstars,"" listen to that flow; ""I'm A Bad Man"" and ""Oh No."""
2,"Its an SF book, but it hasnt got much to do with DUNE.","Firstly, as SF books go, this is better than many ... if only the authors had left the universe of Dune alone.Frank Herbert managed to create a Universe populated by big people with grand schemes, sharp intellects, deep motivations, and competing philosophies, all locked in a deadly eons long battle for supremacy and survival.This book is populated with dim wits with petty concerns, short term goals and shallow desires, all bouncing along fairly aimlessly and counting on luck and coincidence.No gravitas. No substance. No imagination. This book is to Dune as lift music is to a Beethoven symphony."
5,Loop Guru at their best,"Forget the cavilling of pop junkies, The Third Chamber shines as perhaps Loop Guru's most entrancing journey through inner mindscapes. Featuring consummate musicianship and masterful mixes, this disk joins The Fountains of Paradise and Catalogue of Desires to form a triad of lush, ecstatic ambience stamped with the defining characteristic of Loop Guru: profundity mingled with whimsy. For mature mentalities only."
2,Revised my previous review,"Well, I finally listened to this cd all the way through, and then I listened to it again, and again, and again. I still cannot get into this album! I totally agree with the review ""100% pure ambience from Loop Guru"". His review pretty much sums up my feelings. I got this CD because of the rating from allmusic.com. It was like four stars or something; I've noticed they like ambient stuff more. This album might be more 'developed' or something, but I just do not feel the vibe. I actually enjoyed ""Catalogue of Desires, Vol. 3"" more than ""The Third Chamber"". Even though that album does not have much oomph either, there are at least a couple tracks I can get into -- ""After Dark With Reel Tones"" is simply breath-taking. I cannot get into a SINGLE track on The Third Chamber."

4,Smooth,this is one of my favorate gospel reggae artists. Regina adds smoothness & soothing melodies to the gospel reggae arena.
2,Disappointment,"I wish I had really tried to find out more about this little book before I bought it. I wanted to use it as an anecdotal spring board in my leadership study group's work, but it is not at all what I expected. Just a silly little book, if you ask me. ""What Makes a Great Teacher"" is a great book to use as a springboard but this book is not at all up to the other's caliper!"
4,Cold Blooded by Rick James,"I think the album ""Cold Blooded was one of his best albums. Why isn't ""Tell Me (What You Want) with Billy Dee Williams included in his MP3 collection. I would like to buy this selection."
2,Cold Blooded,"This album was the beginning of the decline of Rick James' career. After starting off to a slow boil with his albums Come Get It, Busting Out of L Seven and Fire It Up, and then a 5 alarm fire with Street Songs, Rick douses himself out. Except for the title cut Cold Blooded and the very danceable U Bring The Freak Out in Me, nothing else on this album keeps my attention. There is a duet with Smokey Robinson entitled Ebony Eyes, a ballad in which James tries to equal his sucess with Fire and Desire featuring Tina Marie. All i can say is YAWN. In fact, this album is the last Rick James Album I bought, after buying his previous 5, including the Garden Of Love album which makes Cold Blooded seem like a grammy winner. Hey, tastes vary but I think it would be a better investment if you could get the song Cold Blooded on a Greatest Hits or a Compulation CD with his other hits. PEACE!!!"
2,Cheesy 80s pop,"I found this album on vinyl in a second hand record dealers for $5 in mint condition, which says a lot about the quality of the music itself. The first thing that strikes you about the album is Rick James' appauling dress sense and poodle-like permed hair (the only reason for buying it in the first place). Second is the cheesy 80s script writing and 'pyryamid' theme owing to James' ideas of 'unity'. The music however is merely cheesy 80s pop, with a noticeable funk influence. Tracks such as 'Cold Blooded' are quite listenable though, with great dance beats and classic 80s synth sounds. The last track - 'Unity' - is awful. Attempting to be a heartfelt expression of James' ideas of ""unity"" (whatever that is), this song is laughable compared to the other tracks which have more to do with 80s glitz than saving the world. All in all, a pretty average album worth buying if only for one or two of the tracks which are distinctively 80s in character."
3,The Story of the Disaster in the Newspapers of the Day,"Make sure you have a tall shelf for this book, as it measures 15 inches high. It's a collection of reprints of entire newspaper pages from around the world covering the Titanic disaster in April and May 1912. It includes all 20 pages of the special memoriam edition by the Daily Graphic on April 20, 1912. It's an interesting addition to any Titanic collection."
4,Get a magnifying glass,"If you like looking at primary sources about the Titanic, this is excellent. I found just what I needed -- a key thing, in fact -- for a book I was writing about my great-uncle on the Titanic. The print is very small, though, so get a magnifying glass."
4,"good, but not an A-Z guide","I watched the video so I could help my ten-year-old son pitch. He got bored after about ten minutes. I watched the whole thing and thought there were several excellent drills and insights. But it is not a comprehensive pitching or training how-to video. It is not exciting, but it has a reasonable amount of time with Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson mixed in with others. I don't have anything to compare it to, but believe it would be very helpful for most young pitchers who haven't had much formal coaching, or for their parents or coaches who want to help the kids out."
2,Unorganized and unclear,"In my opinion, this video lacked the organization and clarity to make it good. It would have been nice for these guys to slow down and break each individual segment down in order to let the viewer follow along a bit better. Nolan Ryan was a great pitcher, of course, but I don't think his strong point is explaining and teaching his pitching methods. His input was short and somewhat unclear. There are better instructional pitching videos out there."
2,Thin on information,"I was looking for a video to give to my baseball-playing nephew. This turned out not to be it. This one demonstrates a very specific philosophy about arm, body, and foot position while throwing, but nothing about placement of pitches within the strike zone, how and when to throw various types of pitches, interacting with infielders, or any other aspect of strategy. A few short interludes with 1980's-style titles feature Mr. Ryan's quick and not very informative comments on such questions as handling money when you succeed. Overall, worth $4 but not $25."
3,Nolan's Pitching DVD,"I just purchased the Nolan Ryan DVD for pitching. It was ok. Nolan sounds like he's out of breath through pretty much the entire video and the other guy Tom House pretty much dogs Randy Johnson throughout. The mechanics were kinda hard to understand, and it was confusing as to if this was a TOM HOUSE Pitching video or Nolan Ryan."
2,"Poor production, really sort of a rip-off of the County & Sony Sets","I got this set just so I could have ""all"" the Charlie Poole sides. Big mistake! The Sony set has much better sound quality and very high production values. The County CDS do a decent job of sound and sort of cover the gaps. This sounds like basically a copy of inferior sources and the stuff that the above labels don't cover really sounds bad. I really wouldn't recommend this, even for the die-hard Charlie Poole fan."
1,Would never recommend this,"This went on cakey and tasted absolutely awful. It can't be returned because it has to be unused and I touched it to my lips once. I got it from Beauty Encounter, maybe it was old, or bad, other people seem to like the product. I've never written a review, I buy a lot of cosmetics, but I had to write in case it keeps someone else from throwing $20 in the trash."
5,Speak Out Language Series,"The entire Speak Out language series has proven itself valuable even in those languages where I have strong skills. It is a must for a traveler with no language skills and is organized in an excellent way. The only suggestion for improvement that I have would be to add a metro map for the major cities e.g., for Spanish - Madrid, Barcelona, etc."
4,Very Soft and comfortable,I got this in White and Black and I am very happy. I can wear them under anything and the lace on theh top and bottom adds a little but more interest to an outfit. The sixizng was accurate. They just dont seem to fare well after the first washing and looked a bit worn.
1,Only looks secure,"11/28/08 - I had two bicycles stolen (over $1400 value) from my garage when a thief cut through the cable in one slice. Looks like they used a chain cutter. Unless you're using this as a theft deterrent or for low value items, don't fool yourself that you're buying security."
5,These are great,I wish they were still available! Perfect for elegant drinking or everyday drinking. Also have proven to be very durable under normal wear.
2,A little annoying,"Ska punk blah blah blah. Most annoying, is his Copycat song, he states that Chrisopher Columbus steals the thunder from Amerigo Vespucci, since America took it's name from him. This is retarded, because Vespucci was simply a mapmaker who never came to America, but put his name there because he could. It just irks me."
2,The Naval War in the Mediterranean 1940-1943,Standard short battle history. No new insight or information. could have been copied from Capt Roskill's wotk of the 1950s. If you read this you must read Sadkovich's work for balance and insight into the Italian war effort and why what the UK mediterranean fleet did was not always very inportant to the out come of the campaign.
2,Find a Better Editor,"If I had a dime for every grammatical error in this book, I'd be a rich man. The editing was horrible, and made it difficult to read.The information presented was, on the whole, good. It was nice that the authors made available material from numerous Italian sources. However, the work relies greatly on secondary sources, and aside from attempting to present a balanced perspective, offers little new to the study of the War in the Mediterranean.I had the impression from the dust jacket and other reviews that the book made far more use of primary sources. I was disappointed that this was not the case."
4,It's a good cause,"The idea sounds neat, hearing the best tweets from a great group of people. It was fun to see such an unusual collection of celebrities: Al Yankovic, Sasha Grey, Ben Stiller, Ed Helms, Martin Starr, and on and on. I'm sure the tweets look great in print...they just weren't as funny live. It's worth the 30-minute watch to see the people, and your money goes to a good cause...just don't expect the laughs that you would get from these people in a more traditional comedy show."
1,terrible,"Rob Huebel is my Hero. I love everything that man has ever done. When i saw he was MCing and promoting this video i had to get it. Unfortunately, along with Paul Sheer, Rob only had one joke at the beginning of the show. It went downhill from there. Its just a bunch of celebrities saying their favorite tweet and leaving. Unfortunately none of the tweets are funny.I'm glad my man rob is getting bigger, but what a lame, lame, lame, lame, lame video.At least it was only 3 bucks.You're welcome Haiti."
2,ehhh,Only a couple folks were hilarious. A few were mildly funny. The rest were pretty bad.But it's for a good cause.
5,Jaci's Song Is Great!,"If you are looking for upligting songs, flawless writing and suberb music production then you have to get this CD. I listened to Jaci's song and was amazed by it. What a georgous song! What an excellent CD to put on and relax after a stressful day. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed."
5,very up lifting,One does not find songs now days that will lift and bring you out of depression. but this CD will i find it one that toiuches the heart as the soul. it brings in a peace that only one can find with the Lord. this is one of the very best CD that has came out in years. I recommend this one to everyone. let it touch your heart and soul and bring peace to you.
4,I could sing the enire CD in my sleep!,"I bought this CD not knowing what to expect. I'm glad I did! Just like the TV show, it's inspiring without being preachy. I listened to this CD in my car over and over again when I was pregnant. After my son was born, I discovered that the CD would calm him down when he was fussy. When I didn't have the CD with me, I would sing the songs to him, in order, to calm him. I'm not a fan of the song ""Dignity"" or ""When I See You Smile"", but the rest of CD is great!I've bought it for my mother and mother-in-law. Come on Touched By an Angel, what are you waiting for? We're ready for the next CD!"
5,Unbelievably uplifting!,"I bought the album not knowing quite what to expect, but it's turned out to be the best money I ever spent on a CD. This music picks me up from even my lowest mood! Everyone you know needs to own this CD!"
4,Very uplifting,"I am not usually a fan of Religious pop music, but after hearing a few of the songs, I had to buy this album. I think the variety of artists on this album make it all the more enjoyable. Deanna Carter's ""Color Everywhere"" and Wynnona's ""Testify to Love"" are 2 highlights on the album. The only song I don't like is the remake of Bad English's ""When I See You Smile."" That song would have been better left alone...a 1980's rock ballad turned R&B is a bad idea. But, I skip that track and enjoy the rest of this very uplifting, positive, and inspirational album!"
5,Great songs!,There are great songs on this CD. I love the songs and I also love the TV show so I checked out amazon.com to see what they had. This CD has good singers that sing the songs too. My favorite song on the Touched by an Angel album is Walk with You sung by Della Reese. Go check it out!!!!!!!
5,Wow...what more can I say,"From Della's rendition of the show's theme song to Wynonna's ""Testify To Love,"" this CD is the perfect collection of songs to uplift and celebrate life! You will be blessed by these songs and artists. Come on and get ""Touched"" by this CD!"
5,Great Soundtrack,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to.The best songs on this disc are all of them
5,Loved it,All I can say good 2season can't wait for the third:)...and I just don't know why some ppl be writing bad comments on this lgbt shows
4,a wonderful retrospective of a talented man,"George is back on form with this top of the range Greatest Hits album, he just keeps hitting you with top tune after top tune."
4,George Michael,"I enjoy his singing voice,it has a nice quality. My era was Frank Sinatra and Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole,etc. George has that sexy sultry sound when he sings certain songs. Other songs are romantic or poignant sentiment. His songs can put you in a certain mood if you like. The value of the two cd set was very good. I am pleased with the purchase."
4,Very good,"This album is brilliant, all the songs are classics and you won't be disappointed with this. Highly recommended."
5,Tirets beste samleplate!,Denne plata oppsumerer karrieren til en fyr som har verdens beste stemme. Det er en fryd hre p denne plata. Ord kan ikke beskrive den - KJP DEN!!!
3,Not Quite Right,"It's a good set, worth more than I paid for it on Amazon, but I was very disappointed with the version of ""I Want Your Sex"" they used for this album. This is not the version we heard on the charts, and I can't imagine why they did this. It's a trumped-up yet watered-down variation with none of the punch or magnetism of the original. Bad move."
5,Just another superb piece of work!!,"As we get older it seems that the music we once listened to has changed in many ways. I was a R&R baby who never dared to listen to ""pop rock"" Now that I've aged just a tad. The music I listen to now is much more enjoyable. Hence this box set from G.M. I was never a big fan until now. The quality of music not to mention the choice is first rate. It'll bring chills to your spine. Great music from a great artist."
4,Missing his hits with Wham!,"I would have given five stars to this collection of George Michael music if it had included some of his hits with the pop duo group, ""Wham,"" from the 1980s like ""Last Christmas"" and ""Freedom version"" and others that I remember like ""Wake me up before you go go."" Just because he went solo doesn't mean he can forget those Wham years. He was really instrumental in making a Wham success. Maybe he couldn't get the rights to the music but his rendition of ""Last Christmas"" and his Wham songs are worth listening too.During the Wham years, the music was mellow and shallow but his musical career matured after he went solo. His songs on this collection like ""Praying for Time,"" ""Freedom,"" ""Careless Whisper,"" and his duets with Aretha Franklin and Sir Elton John and the song, ""Somebody to Love"" with Queen are fantastic but I still miss his Wham songs which would have earned five stars easy."
4,Best Of GMich special Limited Edition Gold Disc.......,"The whole album is very good with all the good compilation found on disc. A good recommendation for those interested in this genre of music CD. The tracks are as follows:-Disc 1------Jesus to a childfather figurecreless whisperdon't let the sun go down on meYou have been lovedKissing a foolI can;t make you love meHeal the painA moment with youDesafinadoCowboys and AngelsPraying for timeOne more tryA different cornerDisc 2------OutsideAsFastloveToo FunkyFreedom 90Star People 97Killer/ Papa was a rolling stoneI want your sex (part II)The strangest ThingFantasySpinning The WheelWaiting For That DayI Knew you Were Waiting (FOR ME)FaithSombody To LoveLadies & Gentlemen: The Best of George MichaelN/B: Singapore HMV was selling this album.Review by:DR, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon KahDirector Lou Ye - Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
5,Worth every penny!,"A friend encouraged me to buy this collection and I am glad that he did. It is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! The new songs are fun and the old songs bring back memories. The only drawback was the ""new and different"" version of ""I Want Your Sex"", I want the MTV played track. Otherwise I would recommend this to anyone!"
5,Artist at work,"I like that the 2 CDs are categorized for type of music. ""For the feet"" makes me want to dance and sing along. ""For the heart"" makes me feel it in my soul. It takes me back to a younger time, I loved this music then and still do today. His style and talent are timeless."
4,Complete set of George Michael,This is a excellent selection from George Michaels. The first CD are more slow songs and the second are the dance tunes he's famous for. Great value for the price....
4,Ladies and Gentlemen sit down and enjoy or get up and boogie,This double disc spands George Micheals carreer.I always liked Jesus to a child.Despite his behavior in his personal life{who cares really} its his music that people enjoy.George isn't god he's a singer/song writer...period.Wham broke up in the mid 80's but George continues to perform.I love the sax on Careless Whispers....GOOD STUFF HERE!
5,For the heart and for the feet indeed... benissimo!,The new song 'Outside' is excellent... hopefully a sign of what we can expect in the future from George. The hits are all memorable melodies from his previous albums. Where's the video collection on DVD to accompany this hit collection? I'll be looking for it....
5,CRAZY ABOUT CARELESS WHISPER,"HI READERS THIS IS SOBIA PERVEZ ACCORDING TO MY POINT OF VIEW,THE BEST SONG OF HIS IS 'CARELESS WHISPER.I&MY COUSIN SAMIA&BUSHRA LISENED THAT SONG MORE THAN 100 TIMES,BUT STILL I WANT TO LISTEN MORE. I CANNOT LISTEN OTHER SONGS AS I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN ANY OTHER THATS ALL"
5,Phenomenal collection!,"I bought this double CD the week it came out in 1998. I loved a lot of the songs on there! The ballads still sound good, thought the first CD tends to drag in the middle. His remake of the Bonnie Raitt song isn't all that exciting. I still like Mother's Child, Jesus To A Child, Older, Praying for Time, One More Try from Faith (his best ballad), Father Figure and others. But the second CD says a lot about George Michael as an artist! He can tear it up on songs like the Monkey remix, Too Funky, Fastlove, Outside, Faith, and one other song from Faith. Although George's recent albums have not sold as well, this collection represents the best from his three solo albums, songs from soundtracks, and live performances. It showcases him as a solid performer, musician and songwriter."
4,An almost complete library of his,"If you don't want to go out and buy all of Geoge Michael's CD's (and shame on you for not wanting to do so) than this is a great alternative. Some personal faves like Hand to Mouth, They Won't Go Where I Go, and Soul Free were left off but like every Greatest Hits compilation you can't always get what you want. A couple surprising faves make it on here (Cowboys and Angels, Hard Day, and I Knew you were Waiting) along with critical darlings like Jesus to a Child, Freedom, and I Can't Make You Love me. All in all a worthy work of such a great artist. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was it doesn't have every song from Listen Without Prejudice which is truly his greatest album"
2,Better Than Michael Bolton! Better Than Neil Diamond!,"I am not the biggest fan of this man's music. This man's songs are boring and his singing has always sounded forced, even during his Wham days. Sony seems to have a stable full of artists who they have thrown ungodly sums of money at, talented or not. Michael is more skilled than, say Michael Bolton, but his songs are soulless."
1,GEORGE'S MUSIC DOES NOT STAND THE TEST OF TIME.,"When I listened to George Michaels single ""Outside"" which could only hit one Billboard chart, the Top 10 club play...is it no wonder that this man can't have a hit anymore? ""Outside"" is just a rehash of ""Fast Love"", ""Too Funky"", ""Monkey"" and a little of ""One More Try"" rolled into one. George get out of the 80s! come to the new millenium...Listen to Robbie Williams and get some inspiration! None of his songs stand the test of time except ""Too Funky"", which George even noted in an article as Pop Trash. George definitely wrote songs for quick digestion, to make his bank account bigger, and his fan base smaller. Don't even bother."
1,older but definitely not better,I didn't like the songs. I didn't like the musical arrangements.They were contrived and tried too hard. I didn't like the voices or emphasis of pose. He should do what he does best . Immediate self gratification.
1,Like a Ferris Wheel,The content of this CD is like a Ferris Wheel --- you get the same thing over and over and over and over again. Every song sounds like the one before and after it. So monotonous! Don't bother!!
3,Does my boyfriend named Pee-Wee Herman ring a Bell?,"George Michael - what a character, you say, yep, you are right, a real ladies man, hell, a real ladies lady. He has a couple good songs on this CD, namely the one about, nevermind, I'm thinking about a singer with actual talent, like KoRn. I'm not saying this CD is bad - OK, I am definitely saying it is horrible - do not buy it unless of course, you want to feel like you just got out of the shower, fell on the cold bathroom concrete floor, and banged your head into the comode with vigorous force."
5,"""George lassos the moon!"" (bravo! bravo!)","What more can we sappy adoring fans say? George has gotten a lot of slack over the years, but anyone really listening could hear the depth of emotion and passion that makes him a shining *star* today. If you've never bought a GM album, now is your chance to find out what we're all raving about -- an excellent sampling that deserves a good listen. Five stars, George!"
5,too many bests to pick just a few,"There are definitely just too many great ones to pick from, but I think they did a great job compiling this one. I definitely have to agree with ""Kissing a Fool"" being the best. I'll just keep listening to this cd while eagerly awaiting his next release. Can't wait!!!!!!!!"
5,"The album title beckons you ""come hither""!.","A fitting and relatively complete compilation of the works and times of one of Britain's Singer/Songwiters. 'Ladies & Gentlemen, The Best Of...' is entertaining, mood setting, danceable and so much more. You can visit somber times past or race forward in a dizzying array of funk and club lights. The best of George is all encompassed in these mere 2 disc set. If you're a George Michael fan, this is for you. If you love good music, it's for you. If you want the best of soft and racy, this is for you. It's for everyone...all of us, simply all!"
5,Pure Genius,If you are a fan...you must have this collection. He is a true talent on just about any genre his vocals touch.
4,Fun Romp!,Wonderful artwork and very magical effects! Great choice for the under 6 crowd but may get a bit boring for older kids. My 7 year old still enjoys it but may play with it for a very short time. Still worth it for its story book feel. I really like this title. It was worth the wait!
2,If you have Steve Vai CD don't bother with this one,"Toshi is a great guitar player in the fact that he can play the same licks as Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. If you have any of those two artists CD's then his is not neccesary to own. The most original song on the CD is the last one, which ironically has the least guitar playing on it. He did not push any envelopes with this Cd. A lot of talent, but short on originality"
1,Soooooooo boring...,"[...] This guy is in no way original. His music lacks of soul and his technique is just ok. [...] If you are looking for some ""new"" guitar player other than Satriani/Vai you can buy Andy Timmons just because he's REALLY great! That guy put SOUL in his music, unlike Iseda.>:("
1,WEAK!!!!!!,This CD is WEAK!!! I don't recommend it at all. I was highly disappointed. I heard some people rave about it. ... He has some chops but simply doesn't cut it musically. His playing lacks feeling and he just doesn't cut it in the writing department. The music is not very original. You are better off buying CDs from people you are familiar with...guitarists you have heard before and already know they are nothing short of phenomenal. I'd give it zero stars but it wouldn't let me.
5,Incredible!,"I just got Toshi Iseda's album 'Full On!'. All I can say is AMAZING! Toshi is one of the most incredible guitarist/artist I've heard. This is definitly as good as Steve Vai's 'Passion And Warfare', also another great record! I just picked up Vai's CD the 'Ultra-Zone' and it too is awesome. Toshi is without question, on the cutting-edge of Rock guitar playing. Any fans of virtuosity should pick up this CD! It's truly an incredible piece of work!"
3,good value for the money,This was a cute movie. A little campy at times but all in all a good one to own and watch again.
2,Small,Too small. I assumed it was a larger item. I suppose I should have read the description a little better!!
1,Not worth the money,There are only two songs on this entire album that are good. I am a huge Celine Dion fan and was so disappointed by this cd. Save your money and get the one song off of itunes. Just get Feliz Navidad and you will have the best part of the album.
1,This Cd is the worst ever!,"Before my mom, (who has no taste) bought this CD, I already hated pop music and Celine Dion. But UGHHHHHHH! Oh god! Its torture listening to this garbage. Celine Dion needs to have her mouth taped shut, w/ unbreakable tape! Why don't all you losers who listen to this go listen to some real music w/ instruments like KoRn, Offspring, Everclear, Green Day, Metallica, Nirvana, or anything that actually has talent involved. All this lady does is sit around and sing badly. The real talented people actually play Gutar or bass or something that sounds good, and uses talent, instead of getting all this money for singing crappy songs, and acting like a dumb@$$."
1,These Are Special Times,"I purchase three christmas album this year, and celine was include in the package. Why I purchased it I dont know...Okay I thought with Celine's great voice she could nail some Christmas song. Well she Nail them, but not one single note she hit moved me in any shape or form. It's as though she's a robot with no feeling, no heart. Saddly to say I will not be playing ""These Are Special Times"" for Christmas. I took her right back to the store for a refund along with another christmas song. Celine please try to feel the music, and sing from your heart and not pretend to feel it. These are the special times wouldnt recommend, I would recommend you keep walking passed it or get bored to sleep."
2,Cd would not play in my car.,I love the music on this CD and was disappointed that it would not play in my car. They were great on the refund.
5,Pure Celine Dion music,Loved the choices & whole family agreed best Christmas CD we now own! Oh please that is too restrictive! Love it
5,"These are special Times, Celine Dion","The first song I heard from this CD was The Prayer with Andrea Bocelli. Wow! What a thrill! Then I fell in love with the whole CD! Celine has a great voice, warm, exciting, beautiful! I love it! She has a new fan!"
5,She sings with her heart,"A wonderful Christmas album. Unlike those artists that feel ""compelled"" to put out a token Christmas album, Celine sincerely believes what she's singing about. Highly recommended."
4,a double success,"This is my favorite Christmas album, and also my favorite Celine Dion album. I like a lot of Celine's music on her other albums, but I could do without the heavy-handed production and power ballads. For the most part, there's a lighter touch to the songs and arrangements on this album. Its nice to hear Celine sing."
2,Is this a Christmas Album?? It doesn't sound like it.,"When I heard Celine was working on a Christmas album, I was so happy. I thought it'd be up there with Mariah Carey's ""Merry Christmas"" and Gloria Estefan's ""Christmas Through Your Eyes"" as one of the greatest Christmas albums ever. However, I am truly dissappointed.After listening to the album, there aren't many songs on here that sound truly like Christmas songs. They are your typical pop songs from Celine Dion. Celine should have listened to Mariah and Gloria's albums to get a taste of what a real Christmas album is.The highlights on the album are her powerful duet with Andrea Bocceli, but again, it isn't a Christmas song. And ""Happy X-Mas (War is Over)"", which Celine sings beautifully.If you're shopping for a great Christmas CD, look in Mariah and Gloria's sections, avoid Celine's. If you're looking for a great pop album, buy this one."
2,No Depth to it,Mariah Carey she is not! Her version of O Holy Night is just mediocre compared to Mariah's version. Get the ultimate christmas album: mariah's Merry Christmas
5,Celine is the new Christmas Queen!,"This album strikes a great balance of traditional Chrismas songs and new songs. It is Celine at her finest singing her heart and soul away. I was taken aback by such classics as O Holy Night, The Christmas Song, and O Come All Ye Faithful. Christmas Eve is a fun, dance song that should have made it to radio. The Prayer should be considered an instant classic. This is a must for any Chrismas music fan - whether you love Celine or not."
5,cd,"The CD was just as the seller said it was, received the CD very fast. excellent service by seller. Thank You"
5,An incredible Christmas album from an incomparable talent,"I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but I just had to for this album from Celine. This is the album I put on every year around Christmas time because it just puts me in a holiday mood. Every song is great, some traditional and some new. Celine's O Holy Night really soars! I have never heard anyone else sing that song better. And the last track is touching because she sings it with her family. Anyone who has been to a Celine concert knows that she sounds exactly like her CDs when singing live. She's the real deal. This is a special talent with a special voice. Buy and listen to this album. You won't be disappointed."
5,Celine's Christmas Present to the World,"I've loved Celine since I first heard her sing. She and Mariah Carey are the best singers out there and I encourage you extremely stongly to get both Christmas CD's. Unlike Ryan Borrowman said in his review, it is a total Christmas CD with only two and maybe three pop songs out of sixteen which are by the way sensational. I mean come on, one of the songs is titled ""The Christmas Song"". How more Christmas-y can you possibly get? Plus, seven songs have Christmas in the title. So listen to it at Christmas and July. Just joking. Her songs are old classics with Celine's gorgeous signature trademark on each and a few new Christmas songs that will totally become classics. So pick up this CD along with Mariah's and you will not be disappionted. Quite the contrary."
3,A Noteworthy Effort,"Celine Dion's latest album has its moments. The highlight of it all is the duet with R. Kelly, ""I'm Your Angel"". If nothing else, the album is worth buying for that song alone. The other tracks are decent. This is a great album for true Celine Dion fans, but only a so-so choice for those who aren't sure..."
5,These Are Special Times,"This is one of my favorite DVDs. Ms. Dion had included several of her recordings from other DVDs...but that is ok because they are some of her best works. I am a schmuck. I admit it. Her rendition of O Holy Night is breath-taking and gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. There is something for everyone on this DVD. If you can't listen to it and get into the Christmas spirit then maybe Alvin and the Chipmunks might help...or maybe ""Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer""? :)"
3,Lovely Christmas album from a great performer...,"great Christmas music, although I have to only give this one 3 stars, I was not impressed by the content."
2,Too few songs,I guess I missed the list of selections done with Celine Dion doing the vocals. This is not what I expected. Maybe the other contributors should have been listed. Very disappointed.
5,Fantabulous,This is absolutely a great album. All nice christmas songs sang by the great Celine and also contains real cool tracks like I'm your angel (with R.Kelly) These are special times (written by Diane Warren) The prayer ( a beautiful and warm duet ) .. Can't wait for it to be released!..ultimate album!
3,Like the performance but the recording quality is very poor,"This is one of my all time favorite Christmas CDs despite many of the criticisms of song selection (I agree, some just don't belong). I'm not a huge fan of Celine's music but I really enjoy her performance on this CD. The problem is that the recording quality is, at times, extremely poor. You can actually hear wow and flutter (or their equivalent) on a CD, and incredible distortion at other times. Thinking this was a defective CD, I bought two more, and the exact same problems occur at the same moments played on 4 different high end (home) audio systems. It's a shame a performance of this caliber had to be tarnished by such terrible attention to audio fidelity. These are the producer's and recording engineer's failures. Celine's performance is very good in my opinion, and despite the audio failures, is a seasonal favorite of mine."
5,Like pretty much all of Celine's songs,"I am a big fan of Celine's singing, there are very few songs by her that I dislike. I think that she is a first class lady"
5,When I heard Celine wrote one of the songs- I had to hear it,"""Don't Save It All for Christmas Day"" is truly a brilliant song.I couldn't believe Celine co-wrote this song including the music which came to her while having dinner. She called Ric Wake a producer of hers and sang the tune and first verse and chorus into his answering machine. Later he added the last verse and - voila! the song was ready the next day. Every song is a treasure. It's an all time favorite C.D. Brahm's Lullaby has Celine barely whispering throughout the song and is so sensuous and pleasing to the ear. I'm your Angel holds the record according to Billboard Magazine for the fastest rise to number 1 spot, leaping from 47 to number 1 in one week. It stayed number 1 for 8 weeks. The huge ""The Prayer"" is magnificent and larger than life. The list goes on and on.."
5,"Worth it for ""O' Holy Night' alone","I am simply in awe of her talent. Her voice is ridiculously perfect and this album is stunning. Her version of O' Holy Night gets me speechless every time I hear it. I get literal chills. Its the best version I have ever heard. BTW, Josh Grobin arranged his version almost identically, but even his doesn't come close to her's. Ave Maria is quite beautiful as well. I even love her version of Blue Christmas. It is a MUST for poeple who love Christmas music."
2,NOT UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS!!!,"Although David Foster is to be credited for his excellent arrangements and orchestrations, I felt that Ms. Dion really sounded somewhere in between ""I'm bored"" and ""I'm hysterical"". Truly annoying.Plus, someone should tell her that the Ave Maria that she sang was written by Franz Schubert and not Charles Gounod as outlined in the Cd Liner."
4,Mellow Christmas,I like the CD. Celine is nice and mellow for Christmas. I didn't know there was also a DVD included. I was surprised to see that there are different songs on the DVD. They are not the same ones as on the Christmas CD.
5,One of Celine's best albums to be enjoyed any time of year...,"Celine Dion's Christmas album ""These Are Special Times"" has a little bit of everything from traditional holiday favorites like ""Oh Holy Night"", ""Ave Maria"", and ""O Come All Ye Faithful"", to Christmas ""pop"" classics including Elvis Presley's ""Blue Christmas"", John Lennon and Yoko Ono's ""Happy Xmas"", Nat King Cole's ""The Christmas Song"", and Jose Feliciano's ""Feliz Navidad"". Also included in this collection is her huge hit with R. Kelly ""I'm Your Angel.""The songs on this album are very good and well performed, and this CD contains well over an hour's worth of Christmas music. You are indeed getting your money's worth here! Celine and her family (who also sing on the album's last two tracks) really throw their heart and soul into this album.Any fan of Celine's music will absolutely love this Christmas CD to be enjoyed year round!"
5,A Must Have for the Holiday Season!,"As a great fan of Celines, I was really excited when I heard of this CD! I got it the very first morning it came out and it really put me in the mood for the holidays. Celine's talent is unmatchable."
4,I love the music!But..can anyone tell me about the recording,"Yeah...I bought it right away after I listening in the store!!Every song just sounds great! They made me feel at tha X'mas time... BUT,I've felt trouble! The recording of this albumn just is a little bad... I'll be glad if you can tell me when you listen the 1st & 4th songs,have you heard any noise?? Thanks a lot!!"
5,IT'S AS SPECIAL AS SHE IS!!!!!,"I love everything Celine sings, but I was blown away by her duet with Bocelli. I will probably wear it out playing it for a long time."
5,No more,"If I had to rank the best voices in female music today Celine Dion would have a permanant fixture at the top 10. But do we need three albums in four years? I'm a Dion fan, but I must say this latest album is merely carbon copies of the previous two. The great voice is unchanged, in fact I would say it is better than ever. But the songs are just the same pop music she's been putting out for four years. There is no growth.....how about trying something new? I have her last three albums, and the single ""the power of love"" from the first of those three albums will always be one of my favorites, but it takes more than that to keep your fans."
5,Duet with Bocelli is the best!,The album is beautiful - a wonderful mix. The duet with Andrea Bocelli is astounding - it brings tears to your eyes. Can't wait to hear it all over the radio!
2,First cd works.. the second doesnt... not at all happy!,I bought this item for myself as I love Celine Dion's ave maria.. i bought the collectors version because i planned to give one cd to my friend who also loves her music..Well the joke is on me.. cause only one cd works.I am not even seeing the option to contact the seller.. so its just a waste of money if you ask me.Would never buy again from this seller.. learnt my lesson there.Sabrina
3,Good if you like Celine Dion,"I got it for my mom as an xmas gift, and she liked it. So, if you like Celine Dion I am sure you'll enjoy this album."
4,Very good but not the best!,"I can understand why this album has remained popular since its debut more than 10 years ago. Her producers were very smart including not only popular catholic christmas anthems but also jewesh, she even sing in spanish. Celine vocals praise the Lord, Jesuschrist and Moses at the same time, and as expected she sings in a very classical way, it will surely suit the taste of 40+ people. Overall very good album, just a step below the greatest for me (Elvis first Christmas album, Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas and Trans Siberian's Christmas eve...)"
5,A special gift for anyone who loves Celine,"This Christmas album by Celine is wonderful, includes some Christmas songs like, Ave Marie * O Holy Night * Feliz Navidad & more!! My favorite tracks are.. ""another year has gone by"" , ""the magic of christmas day"" , and ""these are the special times"". Do yourself a favor buy this album for you or for someone special."
5,"EXCUSE ME , BUT IS THIS WOMAN GOD OR WHAT","CELINE DION YOU ARE A MIRACLE TO BEHOLD. I LOVE YOU . YOU ARE THE BEST EVER , THE WORLD HAS EVER HEARD. YOU ARE GODS VOICE TO US ALL. GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR GOLDEN VOICE."
2,"Whining, incredibly annoying voice of a over-rated woman","Having listened to her previous three albums, I can;t help noticing that Celine Dion makes no attempt to produce anything that even borders on the original. Her duet with R Kelly is the only bright spot of a very dul,, 'heared it all before' album"
4,Well er ... uh... this may be for you.,"Walking a Literary Labyrinth is a life-changing book for some readers, a ""yes I recognize that feeling"" for other readers and a ""talk about stating the obvious"" for others. As a Vatican II Catholic who grew up in a reading family, I had trouble relating to many sections of the book. However, I did appreciate the ""rightness"" of her observations regarding the sacramental aspect of secular reading - and the importance of taking care what one feeds yourself through your reading. If you feel guilty ""wasting"" your time reading I'd recommend this book as the appropriate antidote to guilt."
5,"Deep, heart-felt, minimal grooves, caresses the being...","Titles mean nothing... once you get lost in these deep soulful grooves. Combo of house, techno, with that surrounding aural ambient feel; simultaneously making a non-bullish statement that Maurizio definitely feels what he manifests. Other descriptions: PERFECT!!!"
5,Book Review,"I enjoyed reading this book because it was fun and easy to understand. The pictures were cool and neatly done. I hope what you consider reading this book and enjoy it like I did. If you like Halloween, you will love this book.This story kind of reminded me of when I went trick or treating. It was when I was younger and thought that it was awesome to get all that candy in one night. If you read the story, maybe it will remind you of when you were little and went out for candy.Brandon M."
1,Bad purchase,I purchased this but the plus sign doesn't work have to return it let's see how long this takes in the mean time I will use the other one I purchased
2,Great Idea - Poor Execution and Function,"GoodBacklight is nice green.BadBattery life is poor, you must recharge at least weekly.Stock quotes limited, just 15 of only the largest companies,Rubber watch band difficult to thread through clasp.Most time displays (faces) annoying and useless.Unable to delete useless built in time faces from list.WorstWatch frequently loses all content, requiring logging into MSN to re initiate all content."
3,Bulky!,"This watch is extremely bulky, and the wristband does not have enough holes to fit my (admittedly slender) wrist properly. I would recommend avoiding this particular model unless you have muscular forearms."
3,Good watch,I like the indiglo of the watch. I don't like that you have to recharge the watch every 4-7 days.
5,Awesome,"This CD of Bishop Jakes and the Potterhouse Choir is just phenomenal. Every song is unique in its own way. The solists are just awesome. The song entitled ""This test is your storm"" is an encouragement to those who are going through and it seems like they just can't come out. It's only a test and if it was a real emergency, God would have told us. God is great. Continue to be a blessing to the body of Christ."
4,"Pure, unadulterated praise!","What can I say about the the choir and its God-gifted director Steve Lawrence. Steve has truly made an impression on the DC gospel scene. Not to mention the anointed writing of Carol Antrom.""Live at the Potter's House"" puts this choir in the same breath as the other great choirs of our day -- Tri-City Singers, Mississippi Mass, Wilmington Chester, LFT, Here II Praise, and Baystate Choral Chapter (Boston represent)!If you don't believe me, just listen to ""High in All the Earth"". Just remember you heard it here FIRST..."
3,Series gets back on track,"Anastasia returns to form in this volume of the series. Anastasia decides to take a modeling class to help her with her school project ""My Chosen Career""...which is to be a bookstore owner. That sounds like the most excellent career in the world. However, this is also the least realistic of the Anastasia books so far. I find it unrealistic that the Krupniks would let their 13 year old daughter attend a modeling class in downtown Boston by herself. I find it unrealistic that Robert Giannini who appeared in the first and second books of this series would coincidentally show up in this same class. I also find it unrealistic that a 13 year old would have saved up enough babysitting money to take a $119 modeling course in 1987. I remember being paid $3 an hour to babysit in 1991. Oh, well. I always enjoy reading this book, even as an adult."
5,a must read for adults and children alike,"This is a FANTASTIC book. We are reading it aloud with our daughter and all have trouble putting it down! I recommend it to anyone who loves language, imagination and spending quality time with family."
5,mountain path,"I did not get the original book I ordered and after contacting seller, they tried to track it for me and could not locate the book. However, they did contact another seller, bought another book, emailed me that the cover was different, but it was the same book and sent it to me. That really impressed me how hard they were willing to try to a first time customer. I will buy from this seller again if I can. They put extra effort toward seeing that I was happy and got the book I really wanted. I highly recommend this seller. Rebecca Jones"
3,Good for starters,"Bought this as a 'starter' humidor...Loved it at first, great construction, beautiful, etc....however, found it near impossible to keep it at a constant humidity..not sure if it's the glass top or what. I passed it on to a friend who didn't have one after I bought a better one."
4,everything included?,"welp, unless you live in a city that has pg solution over the counter, make another order. it does not come with it. the description says everything you need to get going, well it does have a humidifier and hygrometer to really get these working you need pg solution. besides this small hiccup everything else is sweet. sweet box to store my sweet stogies"
2,Doesn't keep humidity,I cannot get my box to keep humidity above 60% which is no good for cigars. My cigars have dried out. I've even purchased a new humidifier (thing that holds the water) and I have to refill it every week and still can't get the humidity high enough.
5,Great value.,"This is my first humidor, so I don't have a lot of knowledge. Despite that, I can say that it is a great value--well constructed. It seems to get the job done."
3,"won't ""humidify""","My husband was really excited about this gift for christmas, but he could never get it to the recommended humidity. He tried EVERYTHING, filling a shot glass of boiling water, keeping it in different places... it doesn't work. Not even HALF the recommended humidity. It looks nice, but it's useless."
1,Pony up the cash and buy a better quality Humidor,"The hygrometer that comes with this is crap - I had to buy a digital one for $20+ off of amazon so I can make my humidor actually work. If I could do it again, I would of spent more money up front to buy a better quality Humidor."
2,Elegant Paperweight,"As you can tell from the pictures, this is a great looking humidor. It looks great on a desk, shelf or bar. The problem is that it won't stay humid. The hygrometer that it comes with is inaccurate, and you have to get a separate digital hygrometer to get an accurate reading. Even after seasoning the humidor, the box wouldn't stay over 70%. I ended up putting my cigars in a ziploc bag with the humidifying element and hygrometer, closing the bag most of the way, but leaving a small opening for some air flow, and putting that whole mess in the box. It works, but not the way it's supposed to. So even though this humidor looks great, it's pretty useless for it's intended purpose."
3,"Good humidor, useless hygrometer.","The humidor itself is of very nice quality- good seal on the lid of the box, good material, and only a few scuffs on the exterior to complain about. Unfortunately the included hygrometer is 100% useless. As with many other reviewers the included shim is too large so the gauge sticks out of the humidor, and most importantly the gauge is off by a good 20%. Unfortunately, someone thought it would be a great idea to put a drop of orange goop on the one visible screw, so it seems impossible to calibrate my hygrometer. There's really no way to know for sure, as the included instructions don't have a single picture to describe the calibration process."
4,Be sure to calibrate,Got this as a father's day gift. I had trouble getting the humidity up to the recommended 70%. I was only getting 50% (or so I thought). Turns out after I used the instructions to calibrate the hydrometer it read a perfect 71%. It was off a whopping 20%.Works great now.... I used the propylene glycol / distilled water mix (by Madelaine) to fill the humidor. Great deal for the price Amazon is selling at. Love the smell of the spanish cedar.
3,Not the best quality,"A very nice looking humidor. The biggest problem that I have with it is that the hygrometer is trash. My first one was over 20% off of what it should have been. The company promptly sent me a new one, which was still about 10-12% off. I know they're not going to be exact, but this is way too much. While it looks nice, plan on buying a digital hygrometer to keep inside."
4,Makes A GREAT Gift!,"I purchased this Humidor for my fiance as a gift about a year ago. He still uses it every day and is so happy with it. One thing is to make sure you purchase distilled water for the humidifying. Even cigars that were purchased in a bundle and were a little crispy turned out soft and smooth after being in the humidor for a day or two. I don't personally smoke cigars, but he continues to rave about this product even now, and he purchases some pretty expensive cigars."
4,Good Humidor. Bad hygrometer.,Attractive humidor and it seems to be of good quality. Build is solid and the hidden hinges are a nice touch. Keeps a good humidity level of around 70%. The glass panel is great for checking on your smokes and reading the temperature and humidity...after you buy a digital hygrometer for it. The included analog hygrometer is crap. It looks nice but is basically non-functional. No amount of calibrating will fix it. But this humidor plus a $20 digital hygrometer is still a good deal.
3,middle of the road...,"This cigar humidor is a perfect example of 'you only get what you pay for', if you're looking for afine display case to impress your friends or clients you'll need to spend a few more bucks for sure.But overall if you're only looking for an inexpensive way to safely store a handful of sticks this boxwill do just fine- although as mentioned the hygrometer reads low.I tested the level with a known to be accurate unit and at a true 70% this hygro will only reads between 45-50.If you don't mind upgrading to a digital one or can determine the degree of inaccuracy-(e.g.: when mine reads 50% I know it's really 70%) then it's not a bad deal for 40 bucks..."
4,Good for the money,"This is not top of the line by any means, but as a smaller, cheaper piece- it cant be beat.Good looking product that looks more expensive than it is- and it does what it needs to- it keeps my boyfriend's cigars fresh.I think this would make a good back up or start humidor for a beginner. For the pros, this will just look like a joke.No complaints here."
2,looks better than it works,"I ordered this for my husband at he loved it at first. The look and feel are really nice, but when it comes to function...ouch. It is to the point, that I know for Father's Day I will be buying him another one from somewhere else and dropping this one off at Goodwill. It is better than nothing, but it not for someone who cares about maintaining his cigar collection."
4,Short but to the point,Exquisite but a cold performance. It's still better than anything else on the market and thank heavens is not plagued by an overdose of ridiculous musica ficta applications.
3,Rule Britania,"This is not a history book, but a movie script: If it does not move, disregard it. Not a thoughtful biography of a man who is fascinating in the evil he brings to his achievements."
2,"This is a great idea, but needs a ...","This is a great idea, but needs a few adjustments before I would purchase it. First, the tweezers and scissors are cheaply made; the tweezers broke because they're plastic. The scissors are not quite sharp enough to get a clean cut. Second, the case is too small. Once I took the things out to have a look, I had a very hard time putting them back so that the lid would close all the way. I would not recommend this kit to anyone unless those things were adjusted, but it was a good concept."
5,An excellent title for a wonderful book,This book was so good it inspired me to write my first review. It is an exceptionally well-written perspective of small town southern life. The author develops interesting characters that make you feel as if you are living life through their eyes. She bring you to tears with sadness then buoys you up again with humour and the absurdity found even in bad times. If you are looking for an easy-to-read book that will engross you from the first few pages then you have found it with Plant Life.
4,Disappointed again,"Same as one, Is a great moive. Very good effects in the blu ray. sound a bit off. Very disappointed that it was not in wide screen. Really wish Amazon would be a bit clearer on the format of a movie."
5,Finally... A Sequel!,"Forget those garbage sequels that don't have a plot, well this one doesn't have much a plot, but it's definitely worthy. Wesley Snipes returns as the half-vampire, half-human Blade. He joins his rival vampires to exterminate these bald creatures with bigger mouths than Steven Tyler. This is an extremely gruesome movie that actually surpasses its predecessor. I was happy that the mashed potato boy didn't appear in this one. Mashed potatoes are meant for Thanksgiving, not a gross out factor. Tons of action, thrilling moments and a tight soundtrack. You should know that bald people don't belong in the sun and in this movie you'll see why. Besides the glare, it could get ugly!"
3,Missed Opportunity,"""Blade II"" looks and sounds better now that this movie has been remastered on the BD format. The BD version is missing a title screen and special features. The movie company could've made ""Blade II"" even better than it once was. Too bad so sad because it's the movie company's loss."
5,Blade II,"Blade fights super-vampires in this one. This one is especially bloody and gruesome. Like the others, martial arts meets the occult in an all-out war. Ron Perlman(Hellboy,Sons of Anarchy,etc.) stars in this one as as a bad guy. Easily as good as the other Blade movies. Highly recommended!"
3,Hm.,"Nice special effects, utterly forgettable everything else. It's important to point out, though, although the CG is ""nice"".. that dosen't make it ""over-used"".. ahem."
1,SOOOOOO Bad,"I was sooo bored in the theater when I went to go see this with my bf, who liked the first one. The theater only had 4 other people in it and by mid-movie, only 2 were left. I think they were sleeping. Speaking of mid-movie, by then I was so bored I was actually looking around for something to do. Yes that's how restless I was getting. Good vampire v.s underworld of vampire evil. Now I love vampire movies, but this was bad. But you know, at least my bf was transfixed; when he pried his eyes off the screen he knew that was the last time he'd pick a movie. and yes; he thought it was a pretty good movie. Ahhhh!Anyways, the whole thing was really dark lit(obviously, and very redundant- even the fight scenes. Fight to get to the big bad guy, he gets away, plan for another day, all over again."
1,Wasnt feeling Blade II much,I liked the first one alot more. I think it was the change in directors. Part 1 had a better look and feel then this one did. The movie got boring after awhile and around the end the movie REALLY fell off. It just seemed like mindless beatdowns. It does get a one though cuz Leonor Varela was lookin' slammin' through the whole flick but damn that cheesy death scene at the end made me wanna cap myself. If they have a part 3 please give it back to Stephen Norrington.
1,BEWARE - TV VERSION instead of Movie version.,Blade II was 2.35 on DVD but this version is the 1.85:1 TV version. The same as the ALLIANCE version from CANADA last year. The new BLADE and BLADE 3 are in the correct format.
1,Makes Blade look like a masterpiece,"This movie was terrible! I was so exicted when I heard they were making a sequel because Blade was such a good movie, and then they come out with this mess. With a rather dreary plot, the movie projects much more gore on the audience than necessary, and the movie lacks depth. Wesley Snipes is always good, but even he can't make up for the rest of this movie. If you're choosing between this movie and something, anything else, go with the something else."
3,NOT WHAT EXPECTED,"Although this is Wesley Snipes at his finest, this movie came up short for several reasons. 1. It was not the American blu-ray version as advertised, it was a French Canadian Import. 2. Because of this there were no Subtitles and the Menu access was lacking and it was a cheaply made copy. After wrangling with Amazon for nearly a month (on the packaging it clearly states this is a French Canadian Import and also stated that it was only suppose to be sold in Canada only) I am hoping that I have straightened out the problem with Amazon. They have informed me that the distributor has a license to sell this product in the United States, even though the packaging states otherwise, and have vowed that they would in fact indicate that this is in fact an Import. On a side note the Blu-ray version of Ella Enchanted is also a French Canadian Import as was All the Blade Blu-ray movies and all should be marked as Imports now."
4,Big action scenes!!!!,"I knew, right off, when I heard they were making a sequal to Blade, I had to see it. Anyone one who loved the original is in for a treat.Blade II is and action packed thriller, with great stunts and an AMAZING soundtrack! I believe, the special effects may even rival The Matrix!This movie starts off with Blade, shockingly, taking sides with a group of Vampires, to fight a group of super vamps! The mission proves to be harder than they imagined. It seems this new breed of vampires has no known weakness, and loves to partake in a little vampire blood as well as human! And boy are they ever scary, they make regular vampires look like bunny rabbits!The only reason I could not give Blade II five stars is because I found the story line a little lacking in comparison to the original. The special effects were great though and I highly recommend this flick!"
3,a not bad sequel,"I really liked this vampire movie, though its not as good as the first which was really excellent. A lot more blood with some messed up new nemesis'(the effects for how they suck the blood is great, must taste yummy). Snipes is always cool is this part and I think it fits him and I think its his best role, being the daywalker. The action hits cool with some new vampire slayings and there's one dopey scene in which Blade and that chick fight by the highlights, I mean come on you can tell that's fake, but the other effects are way cooler. I just hated that Danny John Jules (Cat from Red dwarf) had to die in the sewers as a lot of those Reapers came up and killed him. A good time...."
4,"Good, but first one is better","I still like the first Blade better than this one. The second one has some dull moment, but slicker than the 1st one. But if you want me to compare the 2, I would say the first one is more original and creative"
4,Nonstop Action,"Blade was a great movie and I actually liked it a little better then Blade II but if you are into action this is the movie for you. The first quarter of this movie tells the story and explains a few thing then the rest of it is one long ... action sequense. Of course, Wesley Snipes plays Blade to perfection, he is the comic book hero of a new era. There are a few twists to keep you guessing and thinking a, little bit, thoughout the movie which with the brutal violense makes this movie great."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Blade and was very much anticipating the release of Blade 2. Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to my expectations.I hate giving this a bad review but I found it completely implausible and had trouble getting lost in it like I did for it's predecessor.I think the acting was severely downgraded, the story was weak and the action was the sole basis for this getting 2 stars.Hard core fans will enjoy it, but I have a hard time believing some of these reviews saying it was better than the original.I've even rented it to make sure that I wasn't in a bad mood that day- nope just another poor follow up sequel that they had hopes to launch into a franchise. No word of Blade 3 because this one did so poorly.Only die hard fans need apply, all others will be left wanting so much more."
5,Pretty Cool,"Well I'm a huge Blade fan and I wasn't dissapointed when with this movie. I was kind of scared to go see it because it seems sequels always get screwed up but this one was pretty good. The first one is one of my favorite movies of all time and I still like it more then the second but the Blade 2 is still awesome. Great fight scenes, the only thing I wish they changed was the way the vampires died, I think it was much better looking in the first. I wish they had another villian like frost in this one... not very good villians in this one. The new vampires looked cool but their character wasnt developed as well as frost or other vampires in the first. If you liked the first you'll probably like this one but still which they changed some things."
1,Why is movie making taking this direction?,"Nothing in this movie redeemed its deplorable violence. The first Blade was original, interesting, and uber-cool. Blade II is a shadow of the first; it is empty, cynical movie making, pandering to the dregs of (male) society. There was nothing surprising about this movie; there was no story in this movie. It tried to make up for this by filling time with the most horrific, violent, bloody, disgusting scenes I have ever witnessed, but it didn't work. It was violent without reason or cause. All of the fight scenes looked staged, and all the technology, which was so ahead of its time in the first movie, looked dated and out of place. Save your money and buy a genuine action movie -not a mimicry of one."
1,Total Doodie,"'Blade 2' suprisingly was just as horrible as 'Blade 1'. 'Blade 1' was absolutely awful(just look at Wesley Snipes' totally 1991 haircut)and this sequel was just as crackerjack crappy. The only saving grace is the much underused Donnie Yen(who also did the fight choreography in the first half of the film, which was the half of the movie that sucked slightly less than the other), but he can't even save this turd of a film. Total Doodie. Can't wait for the third one to come out. I'm sure having the girl from '7th Heaven' playing a vampire hunter is totally gonna continue the legacy that is 'Blade'."
2,"Help, I need a transfusion","One more reason why sequels so seldom work. Kris Kristopherson should have stayed dead. This movie is more like ""A tribute to Wesley Snipes"". The storyline is weak, the plot thin, and if the producers had actually ever read the comic book this was based on, it might have had some promise. The only thing going for this movie is action, probably to cover the pitiful dialogue. If you are looking for a bloodbath, you found it and that's about all. The first Blade was good, Blade II is redundant."
4,"Better than the first, a pretty good sequal",Blade 2 is a great action movie with vampires and blood. The action scenes in this movie are awesome and the dialogue isn't bad. I quite enjoyed this movie and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because at times the movie was too dark.
5,Blade 2,If Blade 2 doesnt deserve 5 stars than what movie does?? I had my doubts when i rented this movie but... It turned out to be sick. The movie is total rush from start to finish very high on the 420 factor. This is probly one of the top five DVDs out there. This movie is a keystone in anyones DVD collection PICK IT UP NOW!!
4,Good but I preferred the 1st,"This is a good movie but I have gotten acustomed to seeing vampires turn into ash. The 1st movie is a little better because every part was fresh and original. The storyline was also more dramatic. In this sequel,Blade seemed to have spent less time a the gym, his muscels are a tad smaller.I still do recommend that you buy this sequel because it has a couple of excellent fights sceens between Blade and the boss of the rebel vampires. And this sequel is a lot better than all the other comic book based movies (X-men,Batman,etc). And if you haven't, buy the first part, that one is a definite 5 star."
2,"This movie kind of..., kind of good too!","The acting was pretty good, some of the action scenes were well done! The parts I hated were all the gory, those were the bad parts, plus the plot wasn't strong, but that didn't matter too much to me. Just the gore! Snipes was awesome, the other actors were okay, good movie with too much gore!! That's why it's 2 stars, said too much, later!"
2,OBVIOUS COMIC BOOK BASED,"This reminds me of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin so much. It's so obviuosly based on a comic book, unlike the first film, which is genualy entertaining. This movie is Matrix Reloaded vs. Bad Vampire Movie. If you liked the first movie, you should see this because the 3rd Blade film is coming out soon, and you should probably bridge the gap between this and that. The ending seems important, but the rest is mind numbing. It's overly long also. It drags on from about the middle to the end, despite the various gun firing and fist fighting."
2,Almost as good as the original,"I liked the sequal slightly less than the original.While this film still possess the kill'em all,take no prisoners attitude by our favorite vampire killer Blade,there was something about this film...it lacked what the original had.It is still greatly entertaining,and the boosted quality in the cgi effects are great,as well as the makeup.It has a decent storyline,and it follows through with a good finish,setting up our hero for his next venture(soon to be released in December).It's a good movie,and well worth watching and owning."
2,"Blade 2 is a boring, gore-fest of a movie.","I rented Blade 2 with some high expectations but was let down tremendously. The special effects are sub-par and the gore was just too much. There is constant fighting in the movie and it all just starts to feel repetitive and boring. I would recomend this to die-hard Blade fans and goth's, but that's about it."
2,Cornball acting and lack of talant,"Wesley Snipes is not a bad actor, so I don't know why he was so terrible in this. The more I watched this movie the more aggravated I became, espescially when everyone around me thought this was the greatest movie they ever saw. Typical sheep who'll accept anything in front of them as entertainment. This was just a poor script, with a lot of hammy acting."
4,Beware of the Reapers...,"The film brings back to the screen the story of Blade, the vampire hunter, himself a human-vampire hybrid in which he must ally with his enemies in order to prevent a new breed of vampires from taking over. It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Leonor Varela, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, though the choice of Norman Reedus as Scud was poor at best as he does overdo it with his character's ""attitude;"" it gets tiring, not to mention extremely annoying after a while (but then again that could have been done on purpose in order to pave the way for his ""ending""). In any case, he is not convincing in his role.Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT! Blade is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment."
4,My favorite of the series.,The 2nd installment of the Blade series is my favorite and I couldn't find a copy of it anywhere but here.
4,Entertaining but gory,"You have to expect gore when dealing with vampires killing vampires and the favorite weapon is a sword. Lots of action, reasonable story line. Just don't let the kids watch."
4,blade 2,i think the sequel to blade is respectable.i find it lives up to the hype.and i like norman reedus in the movie.
5,Blade collection,I bought this movie to finish off my collection. It was a good movie and I enjoyed it just as much as the first and the third one.
2,"The First One Was Art, Not this one","A totally different level of film making and professionalism compared to the original, and not in a good way. The first had a cohesive sense of style, with good choices made in almost every aspect. This one is just a hodgepodge of almost universally bad taste. Somewhat entertaining, but highly overrated."
3,A somewhat worthy sequel.,"This film, though not as good as the original, is a marvel of special effects. The plot is less coherent (and, ultimately, less believable) and moves a bit more slowly. What's missing here is some originality. We've seen most of this in the first Blade movie.Rental only. Buy if you're a fan of the series."
4,better than 1,"nomak is a cool bad guy. the setting (prague) is cool. great ending. cool sound track. only 4 because of some cheap dialoge (which all action movies have) and no car chases. good extras include making of vidios which come out to about 1 hour, half hour of deleted scenes that were rightfully deleted, comentary, stupid music video, and other stuff."
4,Great bloody movie,I thought this Blade was much better then the first. It had a better story. But I'm not really into gory movies but its still pretty good if you like that sort of thing. I thought that Snipes was really cool and believable as a good vampire. He fits the part well. Some of the motorcycle tricks were cool too.
4,Action Packed Adventure,"This is a non-stop suspense action feature with Blade again dominating the scene. This story takes on a weird alliance with Blade and other vampires in a 'search-and-destroy' mission to eradicate an aggressive, militant vampire faction. If your not a blood and guts viewer, avoid this episode...otherwise sit back and see Westley Snipes perform in his morbid action sequences."
2,Part Two is not about Christmas,"Tom Flynn's collection of historical tidbits makes this a fascinating read. Unfortunately, he has an axe to grind and he sharpens it through a considerable portion of the book. He surmises that Christians should shun Christmas because of it's pagan roots, and that Americans should reject it because of its manufactured nostalgia. I agree that children should not be allowed to believe in Santa Claus, but to reject the holiday symbolism because of what it used to mean simply overlooks what it has come to mean to millions of people across the globe."
1,Why not abolish ALL holidays?,"Why stop with Christmas? All holidays should be abolished. Life should be colorless and bland with nothing to look forward to. That way we can work more and produce more.Honestly, why tell people, via this book, that they can't have a holiday? Christmas is what you want it to be, and it's different to different people. It constantly evolves. If some have no religion in their version, so be it. Winter festivals have a long history, so trying to rid the world of Christmas is a waste of time, and would only serve to make life more dull."
5,Can't Describe It.......,"I have heard all of Oasis songs, but this album by far is the 'deepest' of them all. The album's namesake, MasterPlan, was one of my favorites, making me stop for a minute the first time I heard it. If you really listen to the songs, you'll see what I'm talking about........"
5,Why B sides?These would challenge any other decent rock song,Every song on the album is worthy of praise whether it be the rocking acquiesce or the soothing sounds of talk tonight. There is a song for every music lover on this album. Stay Young gets the nerves going. Brilliant.
5,better than other bands' A-sides,"I've seen it written that at their best, no one touches Oasis. Well, these are the songs that did not make the albums, and no one touches these. Say what you will about Oasis and their egos (which of course, members of the Stones and The Who never had egos), no none writes songs like ""Talk Tonight"", ""Rocking Chair"", or ""Goin' Nowhere"". Behind the wall of sound in each song such as ""Listen Up"" or ""Fade Away"" are brilliant lyrics that give an insight about the Gallagher brothers' life growing up in Manchester. The boys will never be confused with Eddie Vedder, Michael Stipe, or any other whiny so-called stars who supposedly would give it all up if they could, but then again, Noel said it best when he said that if Eddie Vedder didn't want to be a rock star, then ""go work in a car wash or Mcdonald's""."
4,"""The Masterplan"" is a great Oasis album...","How I wish ALL bands would do this! Can you imagine getting all you favorite bands' B-sides on one album? Well, that's what ""The Masterplan"" is for Oasis. Fans will appreciate the sharing of the music, and new listeners will appreciate the genuine and good music! These B-sides are non-typical, in that they are very good! ""Talk Tonight"" and ""Fade Away"" are just two of the incredible songs you will find on this album. A great addition not only to an Oasis collection, but to rock music!"
5,Simply Great!,"Usually when a band realeses an album with their b-sides, we hear a lot of bad songs. But this is not the case in here...""The Masterplan"" is for sure the greatest b-sides album ever. I personally think that ""Be Here Now"" is the best Oasis album, but this is a really close second.Noel Galegher is a great song writer and guitar player, and you can see this in tracks like ""Fade Away"", ""Aquiesce"", ""Talk Tonight"", the title track ""The Masterplan"", and even their great version of The Beatle's ""I'm The Walrus"".If you're a Oasis fan, this is certainly a must buy!!"
1,The Rutles,"Naaah, I'll have to pass on this one. Neil Innes writes much better Beatle songs then these guys. At least he realized what he was doing was a joke."
3,Incomplete,"WonderwallAt best, this is only a partial collection, because it omits Oasis's best B-side, Round Are Way, the one used in the movie A Life Less Ordinary and only found in CD form on the Wonderwall single. This is a GLARING omission, and makes this CD much less than a value."
4,"""All we know is that we don't know""","By now everyone either loves or hates Oasis. Me, I love 'em. This album of B-sides is not just another rehash of the previous album. The album spans eight years of Oasis' history. Do not just brush this off as a B-sides album, the songs are great, and most are better than those on Be Here Now. Although there does seem to be some filler (""Swamp Song""), the majority of the CD is superb. The album is very diverse. The songs range from straight out rockers (""Acquiesce"", ""Headshrinker"") to Bacharach-ian tunes (""Going Nowhere"", ""Half the World Away""). The song ""Listen Up"" is a perfect hybrid of ""Supersonic"" and ""Live Forever"". I must not forget to mention the title track. ""The Masterplan"" is the perfect pop/rock balled. If your a fan, your collection is incomplete without this album."
4,oasis's b-sides are better than most bands A-sides,"oasis fans I definately recommend adding this CD to your collection. songs include touching lyrics on Talk Tonight, Going Nowhere, the Masterplan. Cords that rock like Listen Up, Good to be Free, and a beatle cover I am the Walrus.Oasis is the pop rock band for years to come, hate or love their carrisma."
5,B-sides?,"how are these songs b-sides. i ask this question to myself all the time. songs like goin nowhere and rockin chair should have been on another cd, as shoudl the rest of the songs. I love oasis and it kills to see these songs as b-sides when some are better than some a-sides. I will leave it at that and if you like any other cd, then you will love this one evenmore."
4,A lot of goodies missing for USA fans! (why??),"Oasis released a truckload of EP/45's in the UK but because of Epic's lousy promotion of the band, USA fans never got a chance to hear these B-sides. Either you had to pay a lot of cash to buy imports or do CD-R or Mp3 trading to get your hands on them.""Masterplan"" does a outstanding job rounding up the best known ones, and the liner notes and lyrics is a bonus. This is a must have CD for all Oasis fans!But I would have loved to have had ""Whatever"" (which was an A-Side in the UK but wasn't released in the USA), ""Round Are Way"" (which was on the now deleted ""Wonderwall"" EP) and the overlooked ""The Fame"" (a wall-shaking track from the ""Be Here Now"" sessions) on this CD. Oh well thats what CD-R's are for!"
2,Not very good at all,"Probably their worst album ever. I am surprised so many disagree with me! There are only two really good songs featured on this album, ""The Masterplan"" and ""Acquiesce"". All of the others are terrible. The most hideous would have to be ""I Am The Walrus"". I am minimally impressed with this work. No wonder their all B-Sides."
2,Why isn't Freddy scary anymore?,By the time Nightmare 5 came out Freddy Krueger was a pop icon. Nightmare 5 shows this because it tries to make Freddy less scarey and more funny. His one liners aren't that great and I don't know if this is right but doesn't it seem liked they toned Freddy's burned skin down ever since he became a icon? Bottom line this movie trys to be scary but just can't make it. I would not recommend this movie to any Horror fan or any movie fan in general.
1,very disappointed,"Got this for my grandaughter for christmas. Right out of package we had nothing but trouble trying to get it to work. Only one of the pen things worked the rest did not and the 1 that worked only lasted a couple of minutes. Grandaughter got so fustrated that she said hey grandma lets just throww them away. At least she had the doll to play with, because she loves the bratz dolls."
3,Over-Priced,"This book reminds me of ""The Burroughs Cyclopedia,"" a hardcover volume covering the characters, places, names, etc. of many more of Burroughs' works than simply the Tarzan series.""Tarzan Novels"" is a half-inch thick, standard sized trade paperback. That format alone makes me feel the $45 price is extravagant. The entries themselves, however, are much more in-depth than the same Tarzan-related entries in ""The Burroughs Cyclopedia."" Additionally, the illustrations are a welcome addition which is totally lacking in the straight text of TBC.My caveat to the prospective buyer is that you are paying a premium price here. My personal thought is that $25 would be a fair price for this interesting volume. $45, however, is assuming a very generous donation from ERB fans."
2,No tab,"I was hoping for Tab for these songs, but this is standard notation and chords. So if you are looking to get break outs of solos or little Neil flourishes, this book will not do."
2,You may need to be a detective noir fan to enjoy this.,"I didn't enjoy reading this book. I think the noir type writing made me feel like I was reading a spoof that was too long. I enjoyed the Rochester references... maybe I just don't enjoy detective noir... although I enjoyed Agatha Christie... but I think that's not ""noir""."
5,Perfect!,"I bought this for my daughters parent child swim lessons. She loves this thing! She swims around like she's in the bath or something. It's very versitile because of the velcro on the shoulder straps, at the crotch and on the side. She'll be able to use this for a couple of years. It was worth every penny. Plus I get so many compliments from other parents on it."
1,"Good accept big on my 7 month old, and velcroe is sharp","Good quality but the 6 -12 month size is big on my 16 lb 7 month old. Also, the velcroe on the side , no matter how you fasten it, is VERY VERY sharp and i have yet to figure out how to keep it from digging into her armpit when it is on her..."
4,Great swimsuit for the littlest swimmers,"I got the Baby Warma for my daughter because we love swimming but most of our public pools don't have warm water pools and in the regular pool her lips turn blue and she starts shivering after a few minutes.The Baby Warma keeps her comfortable for about 45 minutes (indoor pool at about 75 F) which is plenty of time for us to splash about.Since it opens flat, it is super easy to get on and off, the Velcro is very soft and does not rub against her skin.The suit is generously cut, so do not size up! My baby is average build and at now 12 months still has plenty of room to grow into it.Which brings me to the only point I wish that was different: the Velcro tabs could be bigger (longer) to allow for better adjustment. The suit works best when snug, so I have to fasten some of the tabs directly to the neoprene - which works, but causes piling.All in all it was well worth the money."
4,The Man Who Killed His Brother,This is the 1st in a 3 book series by Reed Stephens.Brew and Ginny are a great team. Mr Stephens has the ability of making less than perfect people very likable.This book is well worth searching and waiting for
1,be careful purchasing from this company,"I purchased this product 2 months ago and loaded the DVD in the player and dvd would not play. Come to find out the company sent me a dvd for the region of Japan and China. The company knew I resided in the United States,be still sent me this video which I cannot send back for it has been 2.5 months. Will not purchase anything from this company again."
5,Jade Director's Cut Review,"Better than the theatrical version. The extra scenes added more depth and development for each of the characters. Better than what the critics would have you believe. Also another spectacular car chase filmed by the director who created car chases with ""The French Connection"" and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" Excellent thriller i give it a 7.5 out of 10. I wish the film was successful. Oh well....."
3,Bad and Good,"Yes, it maybe sordid but this movie is worth getting out for a rainy Saturday night. Friedkin plays with color in this movie extensively and the results are luscious. The editing and direction is top notch given that the subject is difficult to explore. Friedkin achieves a successful disconnect from the subject matter by exploring the story from a neutral POV. This neutral POV is underlined by the film's lack of a clear hero/heroine and the constant use of abstract camera angles. If you sort of lick this get To Live and Die In LA!!!"
2,A Bore,"Sometimes fantasies go too far. I wish this movie had gone too far. Instead, it's a predictable murder mystery. In fact, there's no mystery. If you can't figure out who did it, you should not be allowed out of your house. The sex scenes are not sexy, erotic or titillating. The movie is just plain boring. You want a sex movie to arouse you. This just made me yawn. Besides, who wants David Caruso to star in a sex movie?"
1,READ THE FINE PRINT!!!,"Jade [Blu-ray]This film actually features Chaz Palminteri, Linda Fionrentino and David (I left TV for this and now nobody likes me)Caruso. If you click on the dvd, you will be redirected to a Japanese film.The people at Amazon need to keep better watch over these details. (Come on guys, you should know better!!!) This movie was o.k. on video. I don't think that it's worth the extra bucks just for blu-ray. You're better off getting it on dvd and playing it on a blu-ray or up-scaling dvd player."
1,save your brain and your money,"This film nearly buried the careers of all involved. Nuff said. It is truly terrible, pointless, and I really like Linda Fiorentino, but she couldn't save this stinker. An utter waste. Idiotic. And the car ""chase"" is a joke."
3,OK film,"Not a bad film to pass an evening's time with. A murder mystery with elements of surprise. This film will stretch you neither intellectually nor artistically, but it features some sumptuous interiors and locales (e.g., the real Sheraton Palace Hotel Garden Court done up as a ballroom), and persons familiar with San Francisco will enjoy that and other location shots. Excellent cinematography, interesting music that's not overdone, and so-so acting, but the yarn is at least followable. I've seen a lot worse. Nil extras on the DVD, though, a disappointment."
1,A Precious Gift From the Gods of Cinema,"Thank goodness this has been released in the DVD format so not even a portion of a frame of this trash ""crass-ic"" is missed. If you're wondering why red-headed men never become movie stars (unless you count Yosemite Sam), David Caruso has the answer for you; he sticks out here like a carrot on a bed of romaine. The press said this movie was actually WORSE than ""Showgirls"", released in the same year, if such a thing can even be imagined. Joe Eszterhas shouldn't be allowed to write a check, let alone pen anymore ""screenplays"". Why someone bothers to preserve this while something like ""Chinatown"" has yet to appear on DVD is anyone's guess."
4,"Clever, and VERY original!","All though known for it's shocking and bizarre sex scenes, this is not why I like JADE. JADE is a great mystery, exotic thriller, and anyone who craves action and mystery should give this one a try."
2,Hamburger served on a silver plate,"The technical elements and the production values in 'Jade' are first-rate - fine photography, a creepy James Horner score and lavish, elegant sets. If you are studying production design or film music, this is a good movie to see.The problem is that the script is trash. It's not much more than a 'Basic Instinct' clone with elements, such as ones set in Chinatown, that lead nowhere at all. They just fill the skimpy story out to a feature length running time. Of course, if you are studying script writing, you get some ideas of what not to do.The marvelous cast is wasted because this is one of those movies where the characters do what they do only because the script says they must. AS a result, Caruso, Fiorentino and Palmenteri can do nothing more than give a little color to their cardboard characters."
2,Sometimes you need to trust the bad reviews,"I rented this movie mostly because they goof on it in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" I like Caruso on CSI Miami, but I have begun to see that Caruso always plays David Caruso. Yet, here he plays an even less cheerful cop. What fun. His character in Jade is so stoic that he makes Dirty Harry look like a neurotic. Sadly, this is one of those erotic thrillers that is neither thrilling nor erotic. It's better than your usual Shannon Tweed erotic thriller twaddle, mostly because you get Chaz Palminteri as a supporting character rather than, say, William Katt. The plot makes no sense, however, and the sex scenes are boring. If you want good-looking sex, rent some porn. If you want a good thriller, rent Rear Window."
2,Not very quality,"I would not buy this sweater. It is flimsy, and not very quality feeling. The price was too good to be true!"
5,Great Set of Short Stories!!,Joe Haldeman is one of my favorite writers. This is a great book of short stories that give you a glimpse into the breadth of his writing talent and also a look at his thinking and writing over time. Very interesting compilation. Worth your time to read!!
3,Doesn't make a great first impression,"Writing as someone new to Haldeman, this reviewer found this collection... largely unimpressive. A pall of melancholia hangs over much of the material, which may be a good enough thing in small doses, or in the service of some political aim, but more often came off as merely depressing for depression's sake. A lot of the shorter pieces seemed mere sketches, begging for someone to write a full-blown story about them someday. On the other hand ""For White Hill"" seemed positively endless. The title story was pretty good, even if you haven't read Haldeman's ""Forever"" series, but one can't help but suspect that it would have a lot more impact if you had. Still, it possessed the elements of action and energy that too many of these entries lacked. No doubt there are enough decent stories here to please Haldeman's many fans, but the rest of us might be better advised to start our explorations of his oeuvre somewhere else."
4,Haldeman's Latest Collection,"While this collection is subtitled ""36 Years of Award-Winning Stories,"" 12 of the 15 short stories included span the years from 1995 to 2005. Of the newer stories, ""Finding My Shadow"" and ""Civil Disobedience,"" stand out from the crowd. The stories are angry, disenfranchised, and examine the the state of America during the Bush administration by looking into the future. Short stories, even from a writer as talented as Joe Haldeman, can be hit-or-miss--for instance, the ""hard SF"" piece ""For White Hill"" didn't work for me, since I'm not a big fan of ""hard SF."" Based on the shorts that I enjoyed, I'm definitely going to pick up some of his past collections (all out-of-print), includingNone So Blind: A Short Story Collection,Infinite Dreams,Dealing in Futures, andWar Stories."
5,"Near perfect condition, and best collection ever!","I'd been looking for copies of John Brown's Body and The Mountain Whippoorwill, and here they were in a single collection! Arrived as a boxed set, which I didn't even expect, with some minimal damage to the box but nothing to complain about--that's what the box is for, right? I couldn't be more delighted. :-)"
1,This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot,"This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called ""Look Out, Officer"" that Stephen Chow made in 1990. Shaolin Idiot is not out yet to my knowledge. If you want Stephen Chow's ""Look Out, Officer"" you should buy this DVD if not, don't."
1,Not Formated for USA (Region 1),"I bought this DVD for my husband for Xmas. We loved Shaolin Soccer so much, I thought it would be a great present. We sat down to watch it on Christmas night and it would not play, in any of our DVD players. It was only 4.99, so it's not a huge loss, but we were really looking forward to watching it. Save your 5 bucks!"
1,........,"This movie is the worst ever it has nothing to do with shaolin stuff, it's a story about a cop who got stuck with a ghost and it has bad acting,stupid story and not funny at all, so it's nothing at all like shaolin soccer so you better save your money."
1,Stephen Chow is a comic genius,"This movie, while not one of Stephen Chow's best is still on the hilarious side. There are all the great things you would expect, possession by ghosts, hilarious hijinks....suffice it to say that you'll like it. Personally it was my least favorite of all his movies but still worth seeing."
1,Only Looks Secure,"11/28/08 - Buyer Beware: I had two bicycles stolen (over $1400 value) from my garage when a thief cut through a related productOnGuard Akita 5080 Bicycle Security Cable (Lock Not Included)in one slice. Looks like they used a chain cutter. Unless you're using this as a theft deterrent or for low value items, don't fool yourself that you're buying security."
4,Ambigrams are Fun,"It should be noted that the text ""wordplay"" on the cover of the book is itself an ambigram. Turn it upside-down and it will read the same as right-side-up. You'll find dozens of examples of ambigrams that the author has patiently created.I've always had an interest in calligraphy and different typefaces. John Langdon's Wordplay allows the reader to look at this from a different point of view, and brings insight into how he goes about creating his intriguing ambigrams. It should appeal to the type of person who likes visual riddles or illusions. I first learned about the author's work through Dan Brown's Angels & Demons, which features several of Langdon's ambigrams. I'm glad I purchased the book and love looking through it. Recommended."
3,Comedy and Soccer. What else?,"NOTHING. However this film survives on those two elements alone. My friends and I saw the film in Brazil with a theater full of brazilians who love soccer and cant speak english. While they didnt laugh NEARLY as much as my friends and I, they still enjoyed it.A basic storyline is: After a great life in international soccer, a man is arrested and sent to prison. The warden of the prison is a huge football fan and thus the delima begins for the inmate. Freedom or Soccer?If you dont enjoy soccer, pass this film up. If you like soccer and your friends dont...watch it alone. But finally a film for us soccer fans."
4,In good condition but...,"The dvd region is not one that works in the US. Wished i would have known this. Was able to find a fix but took a while and not worth the hassle. Could have been an oversight on my part (the buyer). Still, was shipped quick and came in good condition."
3,Remake of the Classic,This was far and above better than the Adam Sandler piece of crap. It is definitely a remake of the Burt Reynolds movie. Fun to see Vinnie Jones not play the ugly mean scarey guy. I thought Stathams character was a little too over the top and that is the only thing I didn't like. It was an ok movie. Not great. Not as good as the original but still worth a watch.
3,Play-by-play the way it should be done!,"The play-by-play calls and the inside views from Monks head make this movie worth while. People that cry about it being a remake of ""The Longest Yard"" apparently do not watch many movies as every other movie out is a remake or carbon of something. Pay attention to the play-by-play and you will definately laugh."
2,"Rent It, Don't Buy It","""Mean Machine"" was a predictable and less than appealing movie. The movie had bursts of humor here and there (e.g. commentators Bob and Bob during the final game, Jason Statham as ""The Monk""), and the soundtrack, probably its only saving grace, was quite good...The DVD is NOT worth the price tag because of the lack of special features. Granted, the British slangs were a bit confusing and the alternate ""U.S. Release"" featured on the DVD was helpful. But, one could easily turn on the captions while watching the ""Theatrical Release"" and not miss a word.Rent the move if you want to watch it and save your money for the soundtrack."
5,This book is a treasure.,"This book is outstanding. The three scholarly articles by the authors, the beautiful color photographs of Amish quilts, and even the abundant white space in the lay out of this book all serve to communicate explicitly and implicitly the art, the lifestle and the values of the Amish. This book is a feast for the eyes. Many quilts are shown both in their entirety to show the impact of the quilt as a whole, as well as in close up photos highlighting the hand quilting. And the colors in the photos are brilliant, capturing the startling and moving contrasts and color selections that distinguish Amish quilts. Also scattered among the articles in the first half of the book are both black and white and color photos and illustrations of Amish life. Invest in the hardcover edition, if you are able. This book is a treasure."
5,"Great service, Great product.","The service from the seller was great, and this product has never failed me with my two large-breed dogs who otherwise are nice bait for fleas and ticks. They live indoors with me, and make summers and dry seasons here in the South so much more enjoyable. Easy once-a-month treatment, and unlike topical treatments, you can bathe them/let them swim/get wet without worrying about the treatment's effectiveness."
4,Flea med tablets,This is a great product. It's easy on older dogs and works great. The price is so good I bought a years supply for all 4 of my dogs. If you want protection from fleas this is the one to buy. Trust me I've tried them all.
5,Finally something killed the flees,I tried three or four different types of the on the neck type products. I even researched which one used which insecticides trying to make sure I used all different types. Some of them would make a dent but we had such a bad infestation that they would come back with a vengeance when it started to ware off. I use program for about two months combined with 2-3 strategic uses of capstar and bamm no flees anywhere. It did take a few months because all the eggs that were still viable had to hatch but after a year or more of all out war it was amazing when they just disappeared roughly two months after we started program.I wasn't really keen on the idea of giving my dog a pill but frankly I think this stuff is way better than spreading insecticides on her skin.
2,Cable was cut...,...and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery. I have HALF the cable now.Good price and attractive product for a LOW security environment.
2,A Disappointment,"The entire cast is excellent. It is among the best versions of the Don that I have ever heard. However, the recording uses both sides of one DVD, which means handling to avoid possibly oily fingerprints somewhere requires considerable care. The most serious problem, however, is that no subtitles appear on Side Two, which for me limits my appreciation. This lack is not unique to the copy I received from Amazon. I had had a copy of the identical selection and that had the same problem, which is why I ordered another. It's a shame,because the performance is so good."
2,Elderly females,"The main impression I come away from this performance with is one of elderly females attempting to play young characters. Julia Varaday looks as if she were in her late sixties, and Anna Tomowa-Sintow, her late seventies.Kathleen Battle doesn't look so old, but she has pitch problems.Even Samuel Ramey sounds much older than the Don should be."
2,"a cold, dark production","Karajan seems to have cast a cold, unemotional spell over the performers and had the assistance of costumers and set designers in their using blue and black as virtually the only colors under bright white light I also found, as does another reviewer, that the technical recording has unpleasant distortions in the high registers of the sopranos. The Met production with the Ramey is far better and more human"
3,Good but dark,"I enjoyed this production of Don Giovanni, even though there are some aspects I did not like. The musicianship of everyone was excellent. The opera proceeded at a good pace. However I found the constant darkness overwhelming, even though the light background showing the city was very well done. Similarly almost all costumes were black, as if everyone, no matter what was happening, was dressed for a funeral, even those celebrating the wedding between Zerlina and Masetto. Although that is not their fault, Donna Anna, Don Ottavio and Donna Elvira appeared too old to make their passionate roles believable. The parts of Leporello and Don Giovanni were acted excellently: Leporello a servant, ambivalent, who enjoys, but then also dislikes his role; Don Giovanni: a very charming seducer, who can also be cruel, who does not care at all about the effect of his actions on others."
5,worked well and as expected,this item is a special item for our cheap phone system. It added cordless option to an office without a phone jack. came on time and as expected.
4,"cute shoe, but needs classic footbed","Overall, the quality of this shoe is excellent, but I was surprised Birkenstock would release a shoe that didn't have their classic footbead. Fortunately, I was able to swap out footbeds so I have stylish shoes that are actually comfortable."
5,The Title Says It All,"I purchased this book for an Introduction to Spirituality course. I learned a great deal from it. I started by assuming that Spirituality referred to ways of praying and mysticism. ""Thirsty for God"" taught me that Spirituality really refers to how we live out our faith in God. So a history of how different traditions developed and how they each express their faith in God makes sense and this is what Bradely Holt's book is about. A few times, Roman Catholic beliefs were misrepresented, but that was very few and far between. The book is an excellent overview of the History of the Christian Church and how the Church prays. It is easily readable by any High School graduate."
1,Save your money,"As others have indicated, the quality of Teach Yourself varies from book to book. Teach Yourself Swedish is confusing, boring and of little value to the true beginner.1. First, the book does a poor job of explaining regional pronunciation differences and does an even worse job of explaining general pronunciation.2. Not all of the dialogues written in the book are recorded on the CD. Therefore you are always skipping through the book trying to figure out which dialogue you are hearing.3. The storyline in the book is tedious and boring.4. The different portions on grammar are OK, but there is very little organization with respect to vocabulary.To conclude, the book and CD are disorganized, confusing and of very little help to people with no prior knowledge of the language."
2,"Some Help, but not much","I really found this book difficult to use, leaving you with a small stock of colloquialisms but no knowledge of the actual structure of the language. Why has the ""Teach Yourself"" series changed their format so much? I have a copy of the ""old"" Teach Yourself Swedish as well, and while it's short on dialogues it certainly covers the entire grammar of the language, as well as giving a complete explanation of the pronunciation.With the tapes, this book can guide you to some skill in pronunciation, but I suppose any book with tapes can do that. Aside from that and some of the cultural notes I didn't get much from this book. The material produced by the Swedes themselves is much better and written for literate adults, which doesn't seem to be the case here."
4,To believe un dreams again,"If you are looking for a master piece of theater, you have to get this book. Alejandro Casona shows a story based on dreams which became real for a grandmother who meets a completely different grandson after many years. Her happiness don't let her realize if he is his real grandson..."
1,A Negative View,"As a former member of the scion society of The Silver Blazes, I found this alleged biography of the life of Sherlock Holmes well researched and doubtless correct in many of its assumptions. Having said that, however, I must also say that I have rarely read a book so tedious, uninteresting, and downright plain dull; I only finished it to see if it could really get any worse. The author takes a career filled with events of the caliber encountered by SH and reduce both them and him to insignificant ciphers of unimaginative and prosaic mediocrity. This is not my kind of book: is it yours?"
3,Ferris meets Reese,"Something is a miss when Ferris Bueller gets out done by a "" Girl "". What is this world coming to."
1,Simply not funny.,Although there were a few humorous lines the movie as a whole was pretty disappointing. Matthew Broderick gave a credible performance but the script is lacking i.e. Marlon Brando as Barney the dinosaur wouldn't be very interesting.The films' premise was a good one and certainly promised to be funny but it just wasn't. Not funny from either a high school perspective (check out '3 o'clock high') or a political one (I recommend 'Bulworth').Broderick's great talent was wasted in this one.
1,Avoid this movie,"I wanted to give this no stars, but the system does not allow it. This was one of the most deceiving movies I saw last year, billed as a great comedy. The Mtv movie productions should clue you into what will come next. It is crude, highly offensive and you should save your money. If you like Matthew Broderick in a high school movie, watch Ferris Bueller again."
3,Er...,"It could've been better without all of the sexually charged humor. No doubt, this is a very funny movie, but the sexual jokes just make you wince and try to stick it out until the end. Reese protrays her classic over achiever very well, but the movie just isn't as charming as ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama""."
1,This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year,Don't buy this DVD !!! I invited some friends to watch this lame excuse of a movie. They wanted to take me out and shoot me. It is not funny !!! It makes the popcorn taste bad.
2,not that great,I had heard some great things about election from friends so I was psyched when my friend let me borrow it. truth is its um not very good.. Its really weird and to me it was kinda depressing so do yourself a huge favor dont see it...
4,A disarmingly crafty flick,"I barely knew what to make of this other than I really liked it. Certainly there is the story of a teacher doing himself in by trying to put the class overachiever in her place. Then there is the angle of the teacher who suspects he's not getting all he should out of life and strikes out. (only to have it backfire on him) But a scarey lesson that might be lurking beneath the surface is that those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. The performances are, for the most part, excellent. Reese Witherspoon even WALKS right. There are a lot of nifty gags and some genuinely touching (bordering on sad) stuff. Do the indiscretions people indulge in here warrant the penalties they receive? Is what they receive what they should have had all along? As funny as this movie is, it takes a hard look at some things, and I found myself squirming in my chair more than a few times. Definitely worth a watch."
3,"Skip the movie, read the book","Tom Perrotta's book gets twisted up in a Hollywood vision of the life of a middle-America 30-something guy. It was a pretty good book, and a pretty mediocre movie. Too bad."
4,Wonderful acting and highly original story,"When I first saw Reese Witherspoon in ""The man in the Moon"" back in the early 90's, it was clear that she'd be a star one day. Her stunning acting talents were also very evident. Here, she is nothing less than stunning. In a performance completely devoid of self-consciousness, she embodies a character she herself bears no resemblance to in real life. Matthew Broderick is amazing here, too, in a film of real originality."
5,A Fantastic Film!,"I loved this movie so much, I wish I could see the unedited version. Tracy Flick's plight was the only thing that ever made me cry in a movie."
4,Hilarious High School Satire,"This is one of my top five favorite movies of 1999. I laughed all the way through it and loved its intelligent approach to satire. People whose idea of comedy is fart jokes might not find much to their liking here, because here the humor comes from the characters and the situations they believably get themselves into. It's criminal this didn't catch on to be a big hit."
5,Excellent in all aspects.,"I really loved Election and I'm glad I saw it. It is one of the best comedies of the year and one of the best films of the year, no question. The acting is simply superb, especially from Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein who are quickly becoming my favourites. The directing is marvellous, the script is smart and clever, and the film itself is fully enjoyable with smart plot twists and clever changes.Election is a 'must-see' for the year, it is simply superb and enjoyable. My 10th favourite movie"
5,Very funny,"I found this to be one of the freshest comedies in years. However, among my group of ""movie geek"" friends, people have either LOVED it, or have been very underwhelmed. I fall under the former. It delivered for me in acting, writing, and clever direction. I thought the story was sharp and exaggerated stereotypes to the point that they were humorous, but not obnoxious. This director seems to never ""take sides"" in his movies. Very admirable."
4,VERY WELL FROM MOST ASPECTS,"Reese Witherspoon plays Tracey Flick in Election as the typical American High School council leader. She has a free run with no competition at all in sight until Matthew Broderick, school teacher suggests to Paul Metzler(Chris Klein) who is one of the popular guys to run for president against Tracey for some fair competition. He does so and it gets very close. In between the election mess, Broderick cheats on his wife, Paul Metzler's sister experiments in life and it gets funnier and funnier as it goes!"
4,"SMART, FUNNY AND CLOSER TO THE TRUTH THEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!","This comedy has a great cast headed by Reese Witherspoon. Reese truly embodies this character that I'm sure we all remember from high school. The over achieving, over obsessed teen that would be involved in every school function and would stop at nothing to get what they wanted. This film will remind you of those 80's school comedies but, it's a much smarter satirical film then those type comedies. Well above average for these types of movies."
3,"strange, very strange","when i rented this film i thought it was going to be a cuetsy lil' thing about highschool....WRONG! i soon realized i wasn't watching something wholesome and family like. this movie is very, well it's different. i don't think i would buy the movie, but it was an interesting one to rent."
2,well...,"I really thought I was going to like this movie, but I didn't. I thought it dragged on continuously and the story was third-rate."
2,A bit too harsh for my tastes,"I knew going in that Election was a black comedy, but it was a bit too harsh for my tastes. Standout work by Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon (her performance should dispel any teen queen preconceptions). The overall story presentation was well paced, but there were moments of jarring darkness. Not one I will be watching again"
2,Rambling & Smarmy,"I thought a lot about this film, which usually means I like it, however, I think this film comes up short. I think whether it meant to or not, this film had a pretty low opinion of women, there wasn't one in the film that wasn't domineering, backstabbing or a lesbian. That isn't a lot for a male to choose from. This movie rambled on way after it should have ended, the entire ""New York"" episode could have been cut. But my biggest complaint about this film is: who am I supposed to like, to ""connect"" with? almost every character in this film is odious. ""Rushmore"" was far more poignant and ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" was far funnier."
2,Disappointed and disgusted,"Perhaps it's because I'm a teacher, I live in Omaha, and I'm a women (and this film disgraces all of those), but I think the most likely reason I really didn't like this movie was because there weren't any characters you wanted to root for (except as others mentioned, maybe the lesbian). I like funny movies, but this was not funny. It's a pretty dumb film overall, a waste of brain space, and needlessly smutty. Will not be blindly picking movies with 4 stars again."
1,Plain Awful,"Reese Witherspoon only did the best job. She has the aggression just like everyone has running out for something. Like I did running for Student Council Secretary. Matthew Broderick did a terrible job. It was so bad I laughed at it. Although it was not funny. The football and cheerleader porno video was so dumb to put in there. It made the movie slutty, disgusting and on it's way to an x-rated film. I don't reccommend this film to people. This movie contains some sex,lesbian issues and things worse than that. Chris Klein just made himself looked just as stupid such as in the movie American Pie. All in All don't watch this I was greatful I rented this at my local Dillions store for fifty cents."
1,tacky,having just watched this Mess of a Film I See Why I Stayed Cleared of it for a While.it wasn't funny&the Story has been done so many times already.nothing here gets my attention.very Predictable&Full of High School Cliches.you have seen this film oh about 60-70 different times already with far more Laughs&Understanding of what it was suppose to be.
1,freak show,Maybe the last half makes up for the first half: I could only watch for 45 minutes. It's sophomorically prurient. A production of MTV - I should have known.
1,This Movie Stunk.......,"As a 38 year old male this movie offended me greatly. It was made by MTV films which says alot about the politically motivated aspects of what happens when a Music Video cable channel decides to starts making movies which are politically based and totally one sided. Its hard to believe that Matthew Broderick went from Ferris Bueller ( A Hero ) to a conniving,evil,audulterer (Mr McAllister). Another thing that hurt (following MTV'S political agenda) was that it glorified Homosexuality and made men look stupid,evil, and immature. ..."
1,Horrible movie!,"This movie was disgusting, disrespectful, and a waste of an hour and a half of my life! There wasn't a plot at all, and it is a shame that it contained good actors.. The movie didn't do them justice at all! I don't recommend this movie at all!"
1,Worst movie I've ever seen!!,"I've read so many good reviews about this movie and thought it would be another great Reese movie, but turns out it was BAD. The whole movie is weird and I didn't even get it. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!"
3,This captures the pettiness of high school,"More than most movies I've seen,Electionreally captures the stupidity and pettiness of high school life. While it isn't the funniest film, it has a lot of relevant irony, from the over-ambitious resume-builder to the outcast dropout. The movie focuses on the election for student council president, and each of the three candidates represents a stereotype of each of the main types of high students: the dork, the jock, and the druggie.The movie had funny moments (mostly with Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein), but overall wasn't hilarious. Some of the plot elements, like Broderick's affair, seem forced. Frankly, the movie is funnier because of the parody of high school than any explicit jokes.Also, a note for parents: this movie isn't a family movie. It's not likeLegally Blonde. Several scenes include depictions of sex and vulgar language."
4,A Smart Teenage Dark Comedy!,"This is one of the smartest and more sophisticated teen comedies of the decade. Matthew Broderick lands his best role since 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', and Reese Witherspoon gives a good performance and makes the best of an un-simpathetic character. Essentially a dark comedy with sharp dialogue, this is the smartest and brightest teen comedy since 'Heathers'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
3,AKA: Portrait of Hillary Clinton,"If this movie was older I would say Tracy Flick and Hillary Clinton are the same person. Think about it. Anyway, better than average teen movie. Probably because of the quality of the co-stars and writers. Every high school is required by law to have a Tracy, a Stupid Athletic Hero, 20 bullies of assorted shapes and sizes, including bus bullies, cheerleaders who think their poop is ice cream, teachers marking time, 2 teachers that could actually teach, Pizza on Fridays and the rest of us who didn't count. Enjoy!"
3,A simple movie that is not for children.,This movie is like a teenage flick but I would say it is more for adults with its crazy plot line that dosent even make any scence with its pridictibility. I would say this movie dose have its good moments but other wise this a dull movie that drags you down with its cookey charictors in a story that is far from the truth.
1,not funny poor taste,So dissappointed that talented actors would stoop so low and I agree that it was also disturbing that so many people gave this type of entertainment a good rating
1,Beyond Bad,"I can't believe I watched the whole movie. Don't waste your time watching this movie. I thought it would be somewhat better than it was. Reese was pretty good in her role, but the storyline was terrible."
1,okay movie just NOT one to watch with kids around,"it was an okay movie. I really like Reese and several of the others in the movie but didn't quite expect the sexual content in the movie that it had. There are a LOT of sexual scenes in this film.The only reason why I gave it 1 star was because of it's sexual content, but then the plot of the film revolves around that whole topic. There are some R rated movies that I have watched while the kids were home, but just not in the room actively watching it. This isn't one of them.....I'm glad I watched it while the kids were still in school and not while they were home bopping around the house like they do."
2,mean spirited,"Minor has sex w/ teacher #1. Minor implies (or maybe I just inferred as the history teacher did) that minor would have sex w/ history teacher, teacher #1's friend, after she becomes student body president. History teacher sets out to unseat minor to protect himself from her. Finally, years later after graduating from college and now a young senate page, Tracy appears to be repeating the pattern she's established w/ older men; the implication being that she's having sex w/ the Repulblican Senator from Nebraska. The ending seems to imply that Tracy Flick is going to get far in this World. This could have been a really interesting story if told in a certain wat, but mostly I was just repelled by it."
1,A disgrace,"What a waste of time... This movie has been praised as beingone of the best comedies of the year, but I found it to be nothingmore than a dark expedition into the minds of two very sad and pathetic characters... I only watched it to completion in the hope that it would somehow redeem itself. It didn't. If you find you're not enjoying this film after the first twenty minutes, don't waste your time watching the rest of it. In terms of DVD extras... there are NONE! END"
1,Boring,"I was disappointed by this movie. I had expected a comedy, but found a rather unmotivated mixture of stories, badly put to screen. Flat characters interacting in an uninspiring manner."
1,Booooooring and pathetic,Don't waste your time it is very very very booooooring and pathetic.I would put 0 stars but I cant
2,A must-see for anyone with a braces fetish,"I knew what to expect from this one. I was also coming off Abel's book [Lionel Abel's _Metatheatre_, reviewed elsewhere], and so I looked at the film through the rose-colored glasses of metatheatre, which is exactly what Election is-- Matthew Broderick's character brings about his own destruction through attempting to bring about the desctruction of Reese Witherspoon's character. It's funny in places, stupid in others, and is a must-see for anyone with a braces fetish. Just don't expect too much-- after all, it's an MTV production. Their best, but still, that isn't saying much."
2,Not so good,"I was really surprised by how much I didn't like this movie! I read the good reviews and was expecting a smart, biting comedy. But what I got was a bunch of really, very obnoxious characters with no redeeming qualities. Whoever wrote this could have learned a thing or two from Rushmore. You can have pretentious, annoying characters, but redeem them in the end so we're not completely turned off! Or at least make it funny! I didn't see the humor, and the characters are awful from beginning to end. Sorry, but I was disappointed by Election."
5,Reese Witherspoon... Need I Say More?,"There are many different sides in this multi-faced dark comedy flick. It has a wonderful, colorful cast, including Matthew Broderick (Inspector Gadge), Chris Klein (American Pie) and the talented Reese Witherpoon (A Far Off Place), who give it all shes got and comes out with flying colors. Witherspoon, without a doubt, deserves an Oscar for her hilarious portrayal of this ""go-getter"" character."
4,Fun to watch,I think this movie is fun to watch. Its quirky characters make the show interesting and different. I enjoyed this movie.
4,Not your typical teen movie,"Here's a movie that's greatly underrated, a dark, biting satire that takes place during a high-school election. More about characters and how they really behave instead of the fantasy world too often portrayed in other teen movies. Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick give performances that have to be seen to believe. Unfortunately, the only DVD extra is a audio commentary by the director."
4,Election is a must see movie,"This movie was hilarious and dramatic. Matthew Broderick did a great job as the teacher with problems of his own and the election. Furthermore, Reese Witherspoon makes you want to choke her. I loved this movie"
5,Awesome.,"This movie requires multiple viewings to get most of the jokes. After I first saw it, I knew I liked it and knew that I needed to see it again. It proved much better the 2nd viewing because I listened and watched with more attention. I was laughing at the jokes while other people just sat there. I loved how it reminded me of my highschool...a windowless prison. The DVD is good. The commentary by Alexander Payne is well done."
4,More dark than funny,"This one more than flirts with the teacher/student sex equation, teen lesbianism and adultery, and the result is way better than you'd expect, maybe because little is left to innuendo through the clever use of fantasy sequences. Quite a bit dirtier than you'd think, given the cast and premise, the sophistication level is pretty high for a Matthew Broderick vehicle. This one is a keeper."
4,An Imaginary Jazz Quartet,"This is a delicious album. If you liked Amon Tobin (and you really should), you will like this one, too. They are very similar in many ways, but Tobin sounds more overtly ""electronic."" Drumming is (too) realistic, creative, keeps you on guard. More ""jazzier"" pretenses than Tobin, especially with the bass lines. (a very minor complaint: I wish he didn't use so much of that electric ""organ""(?) sound, though...it risks sounding like sixties elevator music)."
3,Eh,"This marionette isn't something that interests more 9-10 year old girls because they want to play with it more like a Ken doll, not Pinocchio. This toy isn't very educational. It is frustrating. The joints are stiff and can be difficult to move. It is extremely durable because after a few days, it gets forgotten about."
3,Not The Best But Worth a Listen,"Cosmic Wheels saw Donovan working again with his old producer Mickie Most. Some of the songs have an astrological theme since Donovan and his wife Linda were into astrology. There is the rocking title tune perhaps his most rockin' out tune since ""Season of the Witch"", the funny and often nauseating ""Intergalatic Laxative"" one of the songs Donovan fans love to hate. From the second CD produced by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham there aren't too many great songs, but a few highlights such as ""I Like You"" the last Donovan song to make the pop charts and ""Sailing Homeward"" featuring Carole King on piano."
5,"Such a Helpful, Well-Written Book!","Gloria Gaither had a brilliant idea --- get celebrities talking about their own family histories, discovering lessons they'd learned from their parents. You'll find humorous, wise, heart-warming stories on every page --- and if you're like us, you won't be able to put this book down! The chapter by Christian comedian Stephen Hicks was worth the whole price of the book. Thank you Gloria for giving us this excellent book about wise parenting.Dr. David & Lisa FrisbieThe Center for Marriage & Family StudiesAuthors ofHappily Remarried: *Making Decisions Together *Blending Families Successfully* Building a Love That Will Last"
4,Hide and Seek,"I really enjoyed the sequel to Finders Keepers. Darcy's past was different from most characters that you read about. It was neat that she was able to over come her past and try to go on. Most main characters you read about if they ever were in jail, it was because they were wrongly accused. Rarely, do you find a christian romance where the woman was put in jail for a murder she really did commit. I also liked that Buck was able to realize what she wanted and why, and tried to keep his father from harassing Darcy. I would advise to read Finder's Keepers before reading this one. It will help to understand some of the minor characters better."
5,Love it!!,Love this book! I didn't want to put it down. I loved Finders Keepers and I love this one as well! Great read.
5,Inspirational book,"What a great book. I never had any regrets buying this book. Plus the author has so many other great books to choose from, all of which has helped me and my kids greatly. I would surly recommend this book to anyone with children."
5,"Great book, great price",I needed this book for school. It came in the exact print I needed as promised and was in very good condition. I saved a ton of money so I am very happy with that and it also arrived quickly.
1,THE WORST EXPERIENCE SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON AMAZON!!,"I ordered this book July 21, 2010 and was told it shipped on the 23rd. It is now August 23, 2010 and have yet to hear from the seller or received my book. My class is over tomorrow and have to do a 10pg paper using the information from the book and have yet to do any of it. If I fail my class Im definitely going to be upset."
2,Not that great,"This book is extremely thin on the ground, and won't teach you anything particularly useful. I first bought this book around two years ago when I first started developing in Director professionaly. I used it for about two weeks, decided it was nothing like as detailed as I needed and ditched it. Now I use Catanese's book, the native Director help function, and the Dir-3D mailing list (which is a fantastic resource). (David Mennenoh himself is a member of this list and posts questions with surprising regularity)"
4,What is the new url for the book's training sources?,"I just bought this book in Sydney.Overall it's a good book but when I tried to access its URL for the training material,it gave nothing.So can anybody inform me the newest URL for Mr. Mennenoh's Director book?"
5,a desert road from vegas to nowhere...,"One of my favorite movies! The acting is excellent, the plot, fantastic. A quirky little independent movie with a lot of heart, and some really engaging music. Don't miss the main song, ""I am calling you..."" An extremely moving and beautiful song... it will stay with you, as will this movie. Super cute."
5,Movie To Share With My Family,"We have always enjoyed this movie. Its values hold true over the years. The acting is excellant and the story is timeless. People can and do pull together when under stress. We may need a reminder from time to time, maybe this film should be re-released into theaters."
4,excellent&seek vhs-comp.108m.German(subtitled?)version,A dear friend described a wondrful new relationship as having begun/feeling like this movie. I sought & was fascinated but appalled there is a 108 minute German version to which I can find no access. Is there assistance from cyberspace?
3,Unusual story and pretense but it works,"I usually like off center, quirky, far side movies. So I really liked this one even though you never get to know why Marianne's male companion dumps her in the desert. CCH Pounder was terrific I wonder why she didn't make any more movies? Though I question her character's wisdom about opening a diner in the desert. But, it made for an entertaining movie anyway. Enjoy!"
3,Quirky but accurate,"This film presents an interesting relationship between two women from opposite ends of the world. The people are stereotyped, however, contain the necessary quirks to make them real. Highlighting the German's taste in coffee was an interesting touch. The haunting soundtrack and distinct visual style add to the mood presented by the script. Certainly keeps one thinking"
4,"Funny, yet tender","This is a film that nicely illustrates the way people's lives affect each other. It does so with humor at times and poignancy at times. There is a surreal quality to it.The one scene that I was not expecting was the painting scene, when Palance exhibits Ruebenesque skill. And that scene came off quite well showing the unexpected beauty of the star.The chemistry was indeed just right for the three main characters. The direction and cinematography alternated between keeping one on edge and then gratifying our senses.This indeed was a ""sleeper"", and if it did slip past you, I recommend heartily to see it for a very different treat to the eyes."
3,Hard too dislike,"As odd as it this film is, it's hard too dismiss it or dislike it. The story is so unique. I've never really seen another film quite like it. Good performances all around. This is one of those films that isn't really for everyone. But even if you watch it and it turns out it's far from one of your favorites... Well, I doubt you'll regret it. This film is too vibrant, one of those films that's just impossible to dislike."
5,A Total Delight,"I don't have anything to add to the other reviews but just wanted to add another five star rating for this wonderful film.The story, the cast, the music and the visuals are all just right. See it when you're down in the dumps or have lost faith in humanity--it will restore you to hopefulness."
5,One of the best!,"Bagdad Cafe is one of the best movies around! Marianne Saegebrecht is delightful in her role and so is CC Pounder. The movie takes off right from the beginning and never stops. There are a lot of laughs, chuckles, snickers, and just plain broad smiles. The music, of course, is quite haunting. Saegebrecht is quite a popular character actress in Germany and it is good to see that she is getting out to a broader audience."
5,One of my wife's favorites,This was one of the replacement dvds my wife wanted as soon as possible after Katrina.
3,You Must Be Patient,This film is snail slow but interesting. Watching misfits find connection with othet misfits kept me going. CCH Pounder is the spark of attitude needed to keep you awake.
5,"Great movie, the kind that makes you understand life better","People care about people, this is not obvious, but in this movie you can see how what go's around, comes around so beautifully, and simply.it's so nice to see the transformation which the characters are going through, warms my heart, and give me hope that things might be different, now and simple for all of us, only if we care about and for one another.The movie is done in a special way, unlike many movies, the story looks simple, yet it's full of depth which you would like to dive into and become one with the plot...This movie will warm your heart and cleanse it as well, you will love life more after watching it...Micha"
1,Bagdad Cafe in suitable format,"Happy to find this delightful film in a format I can view using standard, Australian, equipment (Region 0).This is most important as, whereas PAL and NTSC work equally well, I am constantly needing to double check the Region.It arrived in a reasonable time.Quirky plot, superb performances.A sweet film without being sacharine."
2,Yawn.,"I'd heard nothing but good things about this movie from critics and family members. Clearly, a lot of folks like this movie. It didn't do a lot for me, though. It had its moments."
4,The Afrin No-Drip Nasal Spray did a great ...,"The Afrin No-Drip Nasal Spray did a great job of clearing up any congestion in my sinuses for at least 10 hours at a time. It was quick to use and lasted the whole day. I didn't have the watery running that you usually get with other nasal sprays, but did feel some wetness within my nose, so """"no drip"""" is accurate. Would recommend this product to friends and family."
2,"Slow, unnatural, and unlikable","I disliked this book, though I did manage to finish it (hence the two stars). As I began the book, I couldn't shake the feeling that Roy and Sam were in their mid-50s, not their actual age of 35, and it really affected how I took in the novel. Their actions did not seem congruous with the way they spoke, and vice verse. The dialogue was stilted and the writing was often confusing with unnecessary phrases. I keep reading reviews claiming that Berger is a ""master of the human psyche"" but I found his ""revelations"" to be weak and obvious. Additionally, I found Sam incredibly unlikable and could not understand why Roy and Sam bothered to maintain such a ""friendship."" This was my first Berger novel, and I wish I liked him so I could read his many other works, but I will not be reading another."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"This book was an absolute waste of time. It read like a stale Daniel Steele novel... actually, I do Ms. Steele a disservice by saying that. The book was completely unoriginal. The characters were poorly developed and uninteresting, the lead character in particular. Save your money and time."
5,TNG - Still the best?,"Season 5 has the TNG cast at its best, with some of the most interesting, entertaining and challenging episodes of the entire Star Trek franchise.However, we are all going to have to consider that ""Battlestar Galactica"" just may be becoming the best science fiction television series ever. If you haven't checked it out yet, you should. It is NOT like the 1979 version."
5,Your DVD player will come alive with season 5,"Spock returns in ""Unification Pt.2""...an episode dedicated to the memory of Gene Roddenberry. Other quality episodes include, Time's Arrow Pt.1, Cause & Effect, The Inner Light, & The First Duty...which is now a required training video for our armed forces!"
4,Miss Codependency Personified,"The woman, Kamala (played by Famke Janssen, aka Dr. Jean Grey of the X-Men), is Codependency personified.I really didn't like how Picard let her give away her life into endless sex slavery and overt, unhealthy codependent bondedness, without the hope of escape or even comfort. But it was a good episode, none the less.Letting her go must have been one of the hardest decisions of his life, and he's made quite a lot of hard decisions. The last minute was very great acting."
3,Neutral,"I found the episodes in season 5 to be a bit lackluster. There seems to be a very large change in the writing staff.Many of the episodes felt like reused ideas from earlier seasons and the more original ones just weren't very good in my opinion.Too much Troy and Riker, not enough Data. There is almost no Picard. While he is in almost all the episodes, he doesn't ever do anything (except squeel ""Abandon Ship"" once like a scared girl, totally out of character).I was VERY surprised at how many episodes there were in season 5 that I had not ever seen before. That was a pleasant surprise, but I think I see now why these episodes are not re-run very often.One of the episodes in season 5 is one of the best of all the TNG episodes. Inner Light is the title I think.I still plan to buy season 6 however."
5,Best TV Series EVER!,"I finally have all 7 seasons, and I will cherish them forever. Finally I can watch Times Arrow part one and two! I would have to say Measure of a Man was my absolute favorite episode, but this Times Arrow is my favorite two parter."
3,"Enjoyable Season, Way Too Expensive","As a fan of Star Trek TNG, you really cannot go wrong. Season 5 has many memorable episodes. However, 45 dollars for shows that are more than 20 years old is ridiculous. It should cost no more than 25 dollars."
5,Unification Part 2,"This is the show at its best. The sense of drama and conflict in this episode is very strong, with humor where needed (see Worf's music request). Watching the two episodes of this story, I can't help but feel, if only the entire series was a continuous storyline instead of great episodes interspersed with some less good ones. Unfortunately, TV at the time had not really gotten into continuous story threads yet (aside from soap operas), and Star Trek would have to wait until DS9 for it."
2,Armband or tourniquet?,"The strap on this armband has no elasticity so that if it's tightened enough to keep a heavy 60/80 gig iPod from slipping, it feels like a tourniquet. At least you can listen to music while donating blood. The click wheel and dock connecter are completely exposed - no protection from the elements or sweat."
1,Wrong Book Inside,The cover of the book was as described. The entire contents was a book about James Madison. Thus the book was a total hoax.
5,Great dvd,This was a really great dvd. I enjoyed seeing the scorpions 20 something years later. I suggest this for any diehard scorpions fan.
1,Images keep freezing,"I have a 57 inches Samsung 3D TV Set, and a 3D Blue Ray video system and The images just keep constantly freezing in a very annoying way. At First I thought it was a disk defect and I even bought The product again, with the same result. I was very dissapointed for I am a huge Scorpions fan. I wish my feed back was as good as the rest, but my personal experience was not."
5,Str8 Cooling,"If you want to just chill and cool out with your girl, this is the CD that will make you just simply enjoy the night ALL NIGHT!!"
5,Variety of stories of a doctor in the 60's.,"I didn't realize this was about a doctor in the 1960's until I read the book. Those were the times when doctors made house calls to patients' houses to visit the sick in their homes. They carried black doctor bags with their basic equipment in it.There are variety of separate stories on all his house calls and the relationships he has with his patients. The stories were interesting. It's like reading, ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"".Makes you realize that back then, doctors took their time to know their patients and established relationships unlike now days.Perfect for people who are in the medical field and are not as well. I am not in the medical field at all but I enjoyed the stories very much."
3,Slippery Casing,"Hi, I purchased a Neoprene Sleeve for my laptop, either this one or one very similar to it. One day, I was walking fast with my computer in my arm and it just slipped right out of my arm, casing and all, and hit the cement. Fortunately, the only damage was minor cosmetic. I no longer use the case though. Don't want to take another chance. I suppose it would be fine if you were to put in another casing like a bookbag, briefcase, etc. But be leary if you are using it on its own and are in a hurry."
4,Fun,It was nice to have all the series together. It brings back fun memories from watching it as a kid.
5,"great series,from bigging to end !","a series that was a head of its time,good story,great action.the animation,was pritty good.look forword to being redone in blue ray"
4,Excellent 80's Anime,This anime may be old but it is classic in my mind. This is the complete story that covers all the books the series takes after. Personally the First Robotech War series is the best but the others are just as enjoyable.
5,classic,An old school classic from the 80s that help start the giant robot craze. From space battles to love triangles and from heartbreak to fresh found love it remains a classic to this day.
2,I can nap to Robotech at this point,"Being that this is another reissue, repackage, with some really lame bonus material that you can see for free on Youtube, I cannot see purchasing this over the previously released Protoculture Edition, or prior releases.Had their been additional animation that was unreleased, like Sentinels material, or Dorvack, dubbed into Robotech, etc. I could see warranting a purchase, but the fact rremains that the most you will get out of this set other than the same old 85 Robotech Eps. is a rushed, lame version of MOSPEADA's Love, Live, Alive. Which, with no remastering visuals, or Blu Ray is like watching classic anime from the late 70's or early 80's. Do waste your money. Watch it on your Youtube app for free on your cell, or on your tablet, Hulu and YT, even Veoh for free is the way to go. Unless you need to nap for over 35 hours without the PC on then by all means. Otherwise, save your money for a real new Robotech production in about 2 more decades."
1,Yet Again? How about Blu-ray?,"Gee, can I buy this all over again for the 3rd or 4th time on DVD? Or, you could try a Blu-ray release and get people to actually buy it... again....Hey, I'm not saying that the show is bad. It's great. I just don't feel like buying it again. If they could do a good Blu-ray release, then I'd pay a lot more. I'm just bummed out that there is no BD version."
5,"awesome show, great value","I have been a long time fan of this show, and this latest edition is by far the best value that it has ever been had at. The additional features are very extensive and include a whole new featurette. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Robotech is seminal......,"If you need an introduction, look no further than this: Robotech is an innovator and legend in Sci-Fi.This show is responsible for many ideas that came after it. It set the bar for animation, sci-fi, storytelling, and character arcs. If you have not seen it, do soimmediately.For those of you who are waiting for Blu Ray, continue to do so. It will be worth it.5 stars for Robotech, 1 star for waiting for the Blu Ray release.Robotech is SO worth it, and it will be in your heart forever..... guaranteed. You won't be able to stop after you see the first episode.Let yourself experience this masterpiece!"
3,Re-release The Perfect Collection,"They could make everyone here happy if they re-released the Robotech: Perfect Collection (Macross - Sothern Cross - Mospeada). This was where they had both the English version and Japanese subtitled version together. This was way back it the days of VHS. All three series had their own Perfect Collection. Really not sure my they are not releasing a dual audio set and just explaining the difference in the stories and the how and why the multiple series where edited into Robotech. My only guess as to why they have not is that ADV translated it to be able to create the release, but never sold that translation script to Harmony Gold.Release it on both DVD & Blu-ray."
5,an excellent film,"i really enjoyed this film and to think that only one professional actor was used is amazing-the lead actress isn't even an actress-she's a banker of all things-the film illuminated a real issue-the situation of Tibetan refugees- and it did so in a non-preachy way-it was in the context of a mystery/romance/semi documentary which did not come across as the usual patronizing view of Buddhists as nice little pacifists(they aren't)-the Chinese weren't demonized as people -just the communist regime,which is really evil and always has been-this film was definitely a ""watch again"" effort that is well worth purchasing"
4,Did I dream it's that good?,"Not really being a Tibet=o=phile, I had no real motivation to get this movie, but I loved it. The simplicity of the stories of these endearing characters is heart warming and mind-opening. And it's always nice to see the darker sides of Tibetan culture - I loved the disco scene. Go into watching it with no expectations and you may be pleasantly surprised."
3,Great Voice..!,"What a great voice! It is too bad that on many of her songs you cannot understand the words. Nevertheless, her greatest song recording is still ""The Journey"" on the THE WAY I FEEL CD..(if you can find it)."
3,Good enough--but not great,"Better at evoking a time and place (60's Catskills) than being a fully actualized film. Diane Lane gives the role of a bored middle-class Jewish housewife her all, but let's face it, honey--not with THAT punim.Liev Shreiber is much more believable as her husband--and of the supporting cast, Anna Paquin does a neat job as her awkward-stage, rebellious daughter. But all in all, the movie has nothing very fresh to say, and is best as an exercise in nostalgia for a milieu that has never quite been given its due."
5,"Touching, intriguing movie.","Diane Lane is simply one of the best actresses there is. Unfortunately, she is rarely seen on screen due to the fact that she is tasteful, has integrity, and is picky about her roles. In this movie, she plays a bored, burned-out housewife looking for romantic adventure. When it becomes clear to her that she isn't going to get that from her nice but straight-laced husband, she turns to a traveling blouse salesman, and the steam begins! They begin their affair on the night of the moonwalk and goes on through Woodstock. Anna Paquin does an outstanding job playing Lane's daughter, also experiencing a longing for some romantic attention. The chemistry between them is great. This film is definitely not for the judgemental. Still great, in my opinion."
5,One of my favorites!,I could view this movie over and over and never get sick of watching it. It makes me wish that I was Diane Lane having a passionate affair with Viggo Mortensen. wink wink ¿~
5,A Must See,"A must see movie, buy and rewatch kind of DVD!!! The premise is great, the actors were totally cast correctly. I enjoyed it immensely!"
5,The best movie I've seen in ages,"I saw this movie in the theater six times and bought the soundtrack - - my ultimate stamp of approval!The emotions are heartfelt and speak volumes about the real life struggles between mothers and daughters, within mariages and with one's own self.The portrait of marriage is the most compelling in that it gives life to something that often goes unsaid... things don't have to be bad, love doesn't have to be lost, for there to be a quiet growing apart and a whispering ""what if"" eating away at the heart and soul of a relationship.Likewise, a young mother, and a teenager daughter reflect many of the same emotions - - wondering what lies beyond their safe world, wondering how much they can get away with before they've gone too far - - with the difference being that it is expected of one and shameful for the other.A sweet exploration of universal feelings and questions. I highly reccommend it."
3,Watch 'Unfaithful' instead.,"This movie is somewhat similar to Unfaithful but it lacks the erotic intensity. If you haven't seen either of them I recommend Unfaithful instead. If you have seen Unfaithful, you can do without it. I found it a bit slow, and if it weren't for the gorgeous Diane Lane I wouldn't be able to finish it."
1,Why can't we review the DVD instead of the FILM?,"I think that is a very fair question, considering the gushing over the film and five star ratings for the DVD. Ordering it on a whim, I have to point out now that this disc has never seen so much as a frame of playtime on my 32"" plasma set, and never will. The reason is abundantly clear during the opening credits. The jagged edges in the credit text, visible on a 19"" CRT, leave one wincing at a bad viewing experience about to be had. A viewing on any PC software such as PowerDVD reveals why this disc is so hard to look at. Clearly taken from an interlaced source, a frame-by-frame viewing shows the line structure becoming visible whenever there is any kind of motion. In summation, this is a dog of a DVD, and even if you seriously dislike the film itself, you cannot argue that any film does not deserve better."
3,Worth a viewing....,"I watched this movie last night and while it did not seem exceptional at the time, I have found myself thinking about it all day.I enjoyed this movie and found that it was like watching a super-sized episode of ""The Wonder Years."" Diane Lane was good, but I found her character too similiar to the one she played in ""Unfaithful.""I have to admit that I decided to watch this movie because of Viggo Mortensen. However, I was disasppointed in his performance and found him very stiff and unimpressive, similar to ""A Perfect Murder."" Cute, but not much else. It is actually hard to believe that this is the same actor who is so incredible as Aragorn in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.Anna Paquin is good, but I actually felt the husband, Liev Schreiber, gave the most impressive performance. I found myself rooting for him throughout the movie and hoping that Diane Lane would get her act together.Anyway, a good movie but don't expect to get blown away. This is a well worn topic."
2,A good film,A good film but BEWARE!! Despite what it says on the packaging this dvd is NOT widescreen and i feel like i have been ripped off.
5,Walk on the Moon,Wonderful movie. Just like it was in the 60'd when everyone kind of went crazy. I think she should have gone with Walker.
5,Spanish soaps,I have not seen this soap in a long time. I would love it it had all the scenes but I did notice it is missing some of the scenes originally in the soap.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this DVD because a lot of the original version was cut out and therefore the movie did not really have a good flow. Sometimes the DVD skipped, and the quality was not the best. I was left wanting, and really sad that the original version was so altered."
4,Good for the cost.,"This item is cheap, easy to use, and has lots of color options. It works well and the openings are perfect for use. It's not super rough/tough but does a good enough job. I use the neckband for my daily walks and it's great because I can see the menu with ease."
5,deanar,I thought the price and the product was excellent and i received it very fast. iw would do business with this company again.
1,The Waltons,"Bad mistake. But my fault.I thought it was the seasons worth of dvd's (looking at the picture). Turns out it was only disc #1. I paid 25 dollars for one disc and got the whole set recently for 28 at a shop in the mall. I will be more careful the next time. So I have 53 dollars in the set. Oh well, live and learn. Just make sure when you buy something from here and or anywhere you are getting what you really expect. Makes it look like you are getting the full set, but look below and it is Disc #1 only and you can get the whole set for under 30.00 dollars. Shop smarter friends and don't be hasty."
3,Thank you to Amazon for removing incorrect picture promptly,"I just wanted to say Thanks to Amazon for removing the incorrect picture (which showed the full 5 DVD set with 5 DVDs visible) within 24 hours of my submitting ""Image Feedback"". Hopefully that will stop anybody else being misled like the previous reviewer."
3,Bertrand Russell Bundle: Common Sense and Nuclear Warfare (Routledge Classics),"Short but concise, and was an interesting read considering the book was published before the moon landings, and after the hiroshima bomb. Before reading this book I was led to believe that Bertrand Russell was a promoter of the nuclear holocaust obliteration of the planet, and not one who believed in the beauty of the life that enriches it. He showed some good insight into the problems that now surround us, with European Unions etc destroying life as we know it via their destructive control of nations (a control which Russell seemed to think would save us!)"
4,Absorbing read!,"I have just finished reading this book which my mom bought for me in the UK. I read it in two days and couldn't put it down. The book tells the horrifying true story of a daughter's discovery of her own father's involvement in the murder of a 12 year old girl who vanished in the 1950's in a small Scottish town. The book traces Sandra's investigation of her own father, and the hideous discovery she uncovers of his [love of underage children] and the deplorable policing that failed to investigate the murder or pursue many allegations of [physical] abuse against Alexander, Sandra's father. The lesson in this book is to recognize that abuse is everywhere, often in front of our very eyes, and we need to be conscious and vigilent in order to prevent it's continuance. I highly recommend this book."
4,Lessons of the heart,"Laurel Canyon is just another up scale California suburb.Into this life style of free and easy rock and roll comes an uptight psychiatristand his medical school fiance: his mother is of another generation.Seduction of the relatively innocent girl friend by the English rock singer and of the psychiatrist as well by another beautiful girlleads to a lesson in humanity. The acting is pretty good and their is a lot of loose sex and nudity, but I wasn't really entertained except by the song that reminded me of one in Shakespeare..."
2,boring,"and predictable, one really good line of dialogue, and i can't even remember that! good cinematography and professional production values, nice overflight of LA area, and the swimming pool looks very refreshing, all in all a seemingly very self-indulgent self-referential theme, which means: boring!"
2,Don't bother,"Don't waste your money on this stinker. Either McDormand and Beckensale needed some dough that week and were willing to look foolish to get it, or they were swept along by Hollywood's distorted social consciousness. Maybe both? In any event, this is a silly porno movie without any porno in it: a repressed girl opens up to ""new experiences,"" egged on by her campy record producer mother-in-law, made lonely by her absent doctor-husband. Sound like a 1970's paperback? You bet. Want to see McDormand and Beckensale kissing for about 4 seconds? This is the film for you. The main mover behind this four-legged barker is someone named Lisa Cholodenko, who both wrote and directed it. Hopefully film has heard the last of her because Fellini she ain't."
3,Students of terrible music should appreciate this one,"I loved the track that Frances Mcd was striving so hard to produce. It reminded of nothing so much as an attempted serious version of the fantasy Eurovision song contest entry 'My Little Horse' which appears in the peerless sitcom Father Ted and is intended to lose the competition so Ireland do't have to foot the bill of sitting the next one. It had everyone I was watching the film with convulsed with laughter.Other than risque, well yes especially if you have lived a sheltered life, but the script is more banal than subtle I'm afraid. Give me Woody Allen anyday."
1,Dull as ditchwater,"This is one drab & predictable exercise. A young couples strength is tested by rock stars and foreign accents. Christian Bale as the uptight, stuffy guy and Kate Beckinsale as the repressed bookworm. After the temptations are overcome the 2 lovebirds relationship is all the stronger for it. Just like life only stupider. Avoid this like the plague unless you are a big fan of head trauma."
3,"Okay, but not great. A disappointment, actually.","A semi-disasterous drama about an uptight son of a famous rock music producer (played by Frances McDormand) who grew up resenting the chaotic nature of life with Wild & Crazy Mom, and as an adult still seems to have a big [problem] about it. His character is really unlikeable, but the director never clearly tilts us in favor of either his mom or his fiance (who gets stuck between the two of them during a trip to California), and thus the film feels unfocussed and shambling. Frankly, I thought this film was poorly written and sluggishly directed, and I think that writer/director Lisa Cholodenko really doesn't have much feel for or understanding of the rock'n'roll lifestyle she's trying to examine. It felt belabored and awkward, which is a tragedy, considering she had McDormand's immense talent to draw upon -- why not make more of that asset? The music wasn't great either: strike three, I'm outta here."
3,"Great acting by McDormand and the Music is Good, the Plot too Obvious","Another excellent acting job by Frances McDormand as a care free hippyish record producer but the couple played by Christian Bale and Kate Backinsale are way too obvious. Bale plays the seemingly depressed son who has an uptight girlfriend played by Backinsale sharing the house unexpectedly with mom and the rock band she's recording. If you guessed that someone one gets liberated, then there's no surprise. Bale's character is so pouty he seems almost in slow motion. In fact after it gets interesting, Bale's big scene at a crossroads slows it down with his interning colleague and conflict interest, Natascha McElhone. McDormand playing out of character is pretty convincing and the rocker played by Alessandro Nivola is quite good. Bale looks more appropriate for the Bruce Ward charcter in Batman as he later becomes. . I would wait for it to come on cable."
1,"With such a great cast, why is the movie so boring?","Most casr members had a chance to prove himself / herself as a great actor / actress in previous movies, and made his / her character a rich & interesting to watch. But somehow - this just doesn't happen in this movie, but I'm not sure why. Maybe it's the standard and predictable characters and story line. Maybe it's the obvious lack of attention to details (Sarah, the supposed 'Israeli' has an obviously Russian accent, grammar and sentence structure). Maybe it's a combination of both - the director decided to focus on the wrong detail to 'thicken' the plot and make Kate Beckinsale's charactetr's dillema easier to identify with, but nudity & sex are too obvious and predictable to add any interest to this already boring film."
4,A reversal of generations that&#65533;s bound to clash &#65533; and does,"Well, I'll watch anything with Frances McDormand in it - and this one's a beauty. Laurel Canyon is a generational role reversal. Hippie counterculture mom, Jane (McDormand), has produced a child, now an adult conservative, Harvard grad, psychiatric intern with an equally proper girlfriend. The young couple move into mom's house, expecting it to be empty, but Jane's still there, in residence with her current lover, a British rocker who's experiencing problems finishing his album. Betrayal and attraction vie for supremacy as the young couple is pulled in opposite directions and struggle with their true natures. Wonderful hang-it-all-out acting by McDormand, and equally wonderful trying-to-keep-it-tight acting by son and girlfriend (Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsale)."
3,Laurel canyon,"Laurel Canyon,I did not care for Kate B. in this role I like her more in a role like Serendipity."
5,A Must See,"I rented this movie because I am a Joni Mitchell fan, and the title just drew me in. I'm glad it did, because it turned out to be an excellent movie."
2,LADY OF THE CANYON,"Maybe one has to indulge in lead character Jane's party favors to enjoy ""Laurel Canyon"", a domestic comedy about a newly graduated physician intern who temporarily moves into his rock and roll mother's home with his girlfriend. As it is, the lusts and loves of the characters inside this Canyon mini-mansion mostly reminded me of a Frankie and Annette beach party movie complete with the foreign exotic beauty who shows up on the beach to steal Frankie's heart. Successful rock and roll producer Jane is all attitude, no characterization, strutting around her recording studio in a muscle T-shirt, smoking joints, and behaving like a poster child for a renewed subscription to 'Rolling Stone' magazine. The rest of the characters buzz around her like equally bland insects to a glaring light. This movie concerns corporate rock and roll and that just isn't cool enough. It also suffers from a sad desire to be ""Absolutely Fabulous""."
3,about this movie Laurel Canyon.....,"I find that the story base of this movie is only average and at around the end of the movie, Sam accuses Ian of having sex with her girlfriend Alex which was soon 'resolved'(if I review the story, it will not be nice to watch). Alex and Sam is having sex on the opeing shot of the movie and there sre no other sex scene appear during the movie."
3,The Graduate Redux,"Like Al Pacino, Frances McDormand tends to dominate any film she plays in, and so it is here. Unfortunately, it's not enough to salvage this cliche-ridden remake of The Graduate (the major difference being that the girl ends up sleeping with the guy's mother). The other actors provide uninspired, wooden perfromances.Spend your money elsewhere"
1,Unfunny Home Video,"The film begins by using a body double for a shocking sex scene that covers up body parts. Symbolism? The couple talk about rentals. There is an academic party with small talk. [No gossip?] The couple fly over Los Angeles on a clear day. Houses are sprinkled over the hills among the trees. [What happens during a fire?] We see a strange household and hear strange conversations. They are working at home to avoid expenses for rented business space. [Acoustics?] The conversations reveal their personalities and quirks. Is that a crazy business? Polite isn't her thing. The boring conversations roll on. Are they tedious? ""It was nice meeting you."" Sonic ooze?I couldn't watch it for more than 30 minutes. Was it meant as a joke? The music doesn't add value."
3,Seen better,"The writers have a great concept story line. However, it unnecessarily repeats itself numerous times. This distracts the audience from watching what's really happening rather than revealing the events in a deeper level. This seemed to have prevented the producer and the director to perform at their fullest. Otherwise, ""Laurel Canyon"" would have great potential because of its high creativity. All the actors are great, especially Oscar winner Frances McDormand in her role as a music producer. Those looking for a great drama are recommended to rent this movie only once. They can form their own opinion."
2,Too many shallow people in one DVD,Regrets that I spent time watching Laurel Canyon which fails to capture the excitement and free spirit of independent musicians and producers. Laurel Canyon attempts to explore the relationships of upper middle class young adults and their parents. The script is unworthy of the quality actors. Finally the possibility of being a mature adult who is capable of enjoying life is explored in the most superficial ways....
4,Spend the time to watch this one..............,"it's not ""edge of your seat"" or dripping with romance, but its good. good, in that you can FEEL it. the tension, the issues, the past, all of it. kate b. is OKAY, her guy is okay. their generic relationship is okay. but, i think its real.Now, lets look at francis. SHE, ONCE AGAIN, IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if for no other reason you rent this movie, RENT IT TO SEE FRANCIS!!!!!! could she be any more real???? what an actress!!!!! actually, what a SOUL. i mean, what a soul she must have to pull from (to play these roles). rent this movie. she, alone, makes it worth it."
2,East Coast establishment encounters West Coast crazies,Uptight girl from Harvard Med School travels with her boyfriend to LA to stay at his Mom's house and while there faces the temptations resulting from exposure to West Coast free-spirited pot smoking types. Almost destroys relationship. Sound trite? It is. Characters lack depth with the exception of the Mom played by Frances McDormand and the ultimately the film takes itself way too seriously.
1,Poor Recording Quality,Great music but very poorly recorded. Consider a different source for your Ray Charles music or at the very least listen before you buy this collection.
1,Not the best,"When I saw the movie Ray, I heard (in additional to many songs I'd heard before and loved) a song I'd never heard and had to get a copy of: Leave My Woman Alone. I went to the local Best Buy and looked at every Ray Charles CD they had, and this was the only one with this song on it. It was only $4.99, so I bought it. Ugh. As the previous reviewers said, the recordings are NOT good. At least the one song I wanted isn't too bad. Several of the others are duplicates of others I already had on disk, and those duplicated songs on this disk are much poorer recordings. Stay away from this one."
1,Seriously nasty,"I was looking forward to using this for my project, but after opening it, it smelled EXTREMELY grotesque. I don't know if it supposed to smell like crap, but I just wasted $8 because of that."
2,Nice material but adhesive is poor quality,"The material is pretty rugged and heavy duty, far stronger than normal duct tape. However, the adhesive is less than what I had expected for the price. I have used it on different types of surfaces and it just didn't hold up. As others have mentioned, a little sunlight or heat (nothing excessive) and this will turn into a sticky mess. Any high quality duct tape will easily outperform this tape. I will not be purchasing again."
1,wouldn't even tape a cardboard box,"I paid over 8 dollars for one roll of this tape because I was moving and I wanted to make sure my boxes were sealed securely. I don't know if I got a defective batch but about a half hour after taping the boxes (brand new cardboard boxes made for moving!)I walked by a bunch of boxes I had taped closed and the tape was CURLING off the boxes- ALL of them, this tape would NOT stay stuck to cardboard! I DO NOT reccomend this tape for ANYTHING. It does NOT stay taped- so what good is it? You're better off with the dollar store brand- at least it tapes and stays taped! It's worse than regular tape."
2,Hyped; short sticking time,"Gorilla tape will not even stick to itself for very long! I tried it to repair broken crayons by wrapping them in it, but the section stuck to its own back let loose in a short time. Other applications soon became unstuck also."
3,Wish it was better...,"I bought this thinking Gorilla glue is good stuff so the tape version should be good too. WRONG. The price was about 10 bucks a roll so I savored the tape for special projects. The projects that did need it, the tape was a tad worse than the huge multi pack of duct tape from Costco. Maybe I got a bad batch of tape so I contacted the company. They basically said ""oh well, sorry to hear"". Since I savored the tape, it was well over a year so I would feel bad bringing it back to Home Depot."
5,Killer Tape,"Killer strong tape, black. Easy to rip. Yes, there is nothing like duct tape in looks and function, but this tape is great."
4,"Awesome, but the black has to go.","Gorilla Tape ""For the world's toughest jobs"".As you may or may not know... black conducts heat. So the tape doesn't last long out in the sun. The shell absorbs the heat and the black color intensifies the heat. It wears the adhesive out by a process called heat contrasting. Where the heat causes the adhesive to shrivel and dry up.For indoor projects it aces, but when it comes time for outdoor projects... you might have second thoughts. The tape is significantly stronger than any other duct tape I've used. But when it comes time to tape up that ole' birdhouse, I'm using my standard gray duct tape.So for now, keeping the side wall on my birdhouse together, must be one of the world's toughest jobs; cause my gorilla tape won't do the trick."
3,Paying for Name,"While Gorilla Tape works well, cannot see that it works any better that other quality duct tape brands and you only get about 1/2 the amount on a standard roll as compared to other brands and it is 25% more expensive per roll. Seems to me it is a case of paying for name on the packaging.Please check out competing items here on Amazon.3M Company 2X60yd Pro Duct Tape 1260-A Duct TapeIntertape 5038-3 PK Fix-It DUCTape 1.87-Inches x 60-Yards, 7-Mil, 3-Packand3M 1260 Scotch Pro Strength Duct Tape, 1.88-Inch x 60-Yard, 1-PackYou will probably find one of these fits your needs at a substantial savings, and ALL are Prime eligible."
4,"Sticky, smelly","Highly effective, very strong adhesiveness!It loses a star for the awful smell. I was wondering ""oh my God what died in the walls"" before I realized it was the tape. It does limit the potential uses of the tape as you wouldn't want to have it near food or your person."
5,Gorilla Tape is strong!,Gorilla tape is all they said it would be. Strong. More or less waterproof too.
1,gorilla tape is bad!,"this tape is the worst tape i have ever had ...doesnt even compare to military duck tape aka ""100mph tape""..it doesnt stay stuck to anything...i hate it.. dont waste your money...dont buy it!"
5,No Question - Great Stuff!,Absolutely the strongest commercial tape that I've used and nothing but positive results.I've used this roll for everything from auto repair to furniture repair and it makes duct tape look like scotch tape.No problems recommending it or using it again and again!
2,Not impressed,"This is thicker than duct tape but doesn't seem to be as sticky. I was using duct tape to patch a hole in my convertible top and that had been holding alright. After awhile though, it would come off. So, I bought this and the next day I see areas where the tape has come up. It's not sticky enough. The area I put it on was clean. Duct tape wins out. I just wish duct tape wouldn't leave the glue residue when you take it up."
5,Gorilla Tape assessment,No complaints whatsoever . Works in burning hot sun as well as rainy weather . Packaging of the item was good and as other reviewers had stated it will peel off paint on some surfaces because it is THAT STRONG .
3,Bahlsen Truffet cookies,I was not very happy when i recieved my order. All the cookies were melted. Very good product. Word of advise. Don't buy any products in the summer time that will melt.
5,Deliciously different little wafer cookies,"I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love. The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk. The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway. The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)"
5,Delicious decadence!!,"These are great! And they can get to be habit forming if you are not careful. I bought the whole case, because you save overall versus going to the supermarket. Very rich dark chocolate, crisp cookie. Worth every penny. Oreo, eat your heart out!"
5,Good with coffee,"These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters. On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut. There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage. Nuff said."
5,delicate biscuits,"When we couldn't find these in our local grocery store anymore, we were very glad to find them available through Amazon. these are light and delicious and a true treat!"
5,DEEEEEE-FREAKING-LICIOUS!,"1. I love Amazon's grocery/makeup/cleaning products subscription service. It is only beta now, but I truly hope they will continue it.2. This cookie is amazingly delicious. I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar. These are cookies just like that. Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world. I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies."
2,Arrived melted/stuck together,The title says it. Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted. Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below. It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here. It was 65F here when the package was delivered.
2,Rather Bland,"I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'."
1,bal,"Bahlsen Butter Cookies,4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG.Also i emailed not send me any cookie with EGGS"

5,Battery cables for learning dynamic ColdFusion MX,"This is one excellent book that will super-charge your ColdFusion MX skills! I've learned more about building front-end web sites connected to back-end databases from this book in the shortest time than anywhere else. The author builds on everyday concepts that are truly useful in the real world. Each line of ColdFusion code is printed out and thoroughly explained. My own web site ""graduated"" from being simply a static site to a database-driven dynamic one in a month's time by applying the techniques I learned. This book is a ""must have"" if you're truly interested in seeing and learning about the power of ColdFusion MX."
4,"For a book touted as being ""for the beginner""....","...it didn't disappoint. It's rare that a ""beginner's book"" turns out to be just that, but this one is a rare exception. The book does such a wonderful job ""introducing"" you to ColdFusion, it makes you wonder why all tutorials can't be written this way. Moore does a superb job of breaking (what I thought was a monster of a language) ColdFusion down to its simplest terms and made it VERY easy to digest. I've not yet completed the book (currently on step 8), but I have already ordered a more advanced book for further study - he writes in a way that MAKES you want to learn more (as well it should)!Bravo, Mr. Moore! Excellent introduction to ColdFusion - highly recommended reading for anyone wanting to take their design and site management to the next (necessary) level."
4,good entry level,"R. Schleicher's ""N Scale Model Railroading"" book though older is detailed ehough to aid your planning yet a little opinionated.It's still a very good starting out venture and an interesting read.Rich"
4,A Nice Book,"Robert Schleicher is a master when it comes to model railroading. This book is a nice supplement to any other books one has about N scale. Offers helpful information about couplers, remotoring, and scenery."
4,More than you want to know,"This year marks the 225th anniversary of the siege of Yorktown, the action that efectively ended the Revolutionary War, and this book takes you through the entire scenario. Unfortunately, I found that the book, though informative, was perhaps too much of a good thing! While I'm a history buff, I didn't feel it necessary for my understanding of this engagement to know who was the Officer of the Watch on a particular day, or exactly how the redoubts measured, or the order of the various regiments, or which group was in which revetment at what time on a paticular day. The book just gave the reader too much info, and that really tended to bog down the exciting story that is Yorktown. I've walked over thesse fields, and find the whole thing fascinating, but could have done with a lot less nonessential info, so that the narrative could have flowed much better than it did!"
2,Expected it to be much better,Disappointed in the book. Really loaded with lots of details but very little story that grabs your interest.
5,U3 1Gig MP3 by Cowon,"This is first time i got mp3 player from Cowon and i m very impressed with the quality of this little mp3 player. First thing is this player is very small player and it has tons of features such as fm radio, picture viewing, eq, and u can also watch videos. And this little device makes such good sound, best i ever heard, i used to have players from iriver, philips, creative, never had ipod because i just dont like it^^, but out of all the ones i used own this thing made best sound. its veryt portable, and looks very strongly built. I use it everyday to go to classes and also use it in classes and until now i have had no problem. one thing i wish they gave us was ac power connector its kinda annoying everytime u try to recharge the battery u have to have computer... other than that i think this is the best mp3 player i ever owned so far. Good JOb Cowon"
5,Hands down....,"The best mp3 player I have ever had. It is much smaller than the picture makes it out to be. Fits in your pocket easily and the sound is amazing. I was able to charge the device, put over 50 songs in it and play it about 30 minutes right out of the box. It's so easy and simple to use, highly recommended. It also has a lot of additional features."
3,Serpent 1/144,"This is an overall good first gundam kit. it's not very detailed. It doesn't have many pieces so it's easier to build. I can't really say much about it cuz it's been so long since i built it. Get it for your first Gundam model. Contrary to the box, there is no such thing as the Serpent Custom. Only the Serpent. There can't be a custom cuz there wasn't a Serpent in the GW series! Well that raps it up. Have fun!"
5,multiple requests for more!!!,"I've given this as a gift, and have had requests for more!!! You can order gift baskets online on the company's website....and you can occassionally find the products at specialty stores. The gift baskets are a DEFINITE must for gift giving!!!"
5,It isn't....It isn't....It isn't....It isn't.......Thank God!,"It isn't as gloomy as Sweeney Todd. It isn't as good as Company. It's not as deep as Passion. Or as engrossing as Assassins.Good grief, people, stop griping.Here's a great big fat clue: SONDHEIM DOESN'T REPEAT HIMSELF!Follies isn't like Sweeney Todd which isn't like A Little Night Music because each of those shows, and all the others by our resident genius, are once in a lifetime occurrences, special in that they will never be repeated. That's why Mr. S. had been known to got back and rework, fine tune and re-polish a show. He doesn't want to repeat it, he wants to perfect it.So stop grousing and be grateful he wrote each of these great shows once.By-the-way, it may have been mentioned here, but I didn't see it: There's a major change in this CD: Night Waltz 2 has been added. I'd say that's a pretty big deal.Of course, it doesn't sound like Sunday in the Park with George........."
3,A Soft Sondhiem,"Like other Sondheim shows, the lyrics are fabulous. But theres no horribly dark lyrics or moods. Myabe a little hint of one in ""You Must Meet My Wife"" but you have to listen for it. The music is nice and soothing. Everything one would expect from a master. It is a more classical show, but a good one. I would definitly suggest this to anyone. Ballad rich, small talented cast, and a well known Sondheim gem ""Send In The Clowns"" is hidden here. Nothing like Sweeny Todd, but still wonderful. Favorite songs: ""Now--Later--Soon"" & ""Praise to Women"""
3,A Sondheim classic!,"Glynis Johns is in the best role of her Broadway career! She sings the wonderful ""Send In The Clowns."" Plus Len Cariou provides for excitement."
3,Not that exciting,"Seems silly, but the only reason I purchased this album was because my favourite version of SEND IN THE CLOWNS is sung by Glynis Johns.I can understand why this did not have a long run on stage. It is based on an Ingmar Bergman play and he isn't the most cheerful writer. That is not to say I don't like Bergman. Stephen Sondheim made a mistake here but I now have one of my favourites, and it was written for the voice of Glynis Johns. Frank Sinatra also sings it but with a kind of couldn't care less attitude. Whoops now I have upset someone."
1,"Broadway used to have love, then sex, now its divorce.","There is only one track on this thing worth listening to: ""Send in the Clowns"". Otherwise, it's a schmaltzy story of two ""upscales"" on the way to filing in divorce court. The score is mundane with that one exception. The book is less than inspiring. I'm trying to sell my copy in a zShop. West Side Story it's not."
2,Stephen Sonheim is so overrated!,Sondheim has written some beautiful song over the years but most of is just tuneless little melodies that arn't that good.
3,Amazing paintings...brief explanations and advice,"the mastery with which timothy easton paints made me want to learn from THIS book rather than several others. He appears to use brighter colors (especially greens) than the other painters with instruction books which drew me in. The book is fairly short though and the instruction sections are very brief. For a basics book, I would prefer one that started from square 1 (or even zero) whereas this book seems to jump ahead pretty quickly.I would say this book is a good companion to ""All About Techniques in Oil"" which gives more instruction. However, I continue to look at this book for the author's fabulous examples and use of vivid colors."
4,"Lovely melodic, almost operetta","If you're at all familiar with ""Die Tode Stadt"" or ""Das Wunder de Helena"" you're be surprised and perhaps delighted by this frothy work. The performances and recording are quite lovely, and it's a charming work if you're in the mood."
4,good but too short a story,"I enjoyed this story the best of the ones in this book. I was disappointed that it was so short. I think that it could have been a full-length novel instead of the short story that it is. I would like to see her give the other bandmembers their stories also, perhaps Ms. Palmer could have her own book of short stories based on the band"
5,Tourmaline provides an excellent product AND customer service,"I absolutely LOVE my T3 Tourmaline travel hairdryer. My hair is never frizzy and dries so much faster with this product than with other dryers I have used in the past. It is compact and yet still powerful, perfect for travelers.Tourmaline also provides amazing customer service. After a year, something happened to my hairdryer and the motor was making a funny smell. I emailed the company (as they have a 4-year warranty - an incredible policy these days) and they responded within 2 hours! They backed their warranty 100% and replaced my hairdryer within 2 weeks! I will definitely purchase future products from them and recommend them highly."
1,Don't bother...,"I'll keep it simple: In the famous words of the comic book trader fron The Simpsons, ""Worst book ever"". Tom is a dolt."
4,More people should (try to) read this book.,"This is one of several books I've read on music analysis. What separates this one from the others is the focus on pop music. It provides a solid foundation for how to analyze a song, not just review it from the traditional ""I liked it / I didn't like it"" perspective.Using many familiar songwriters, and comparing works against other music genres, helps to drive home the author's points. The only criticizm I'll make is that I agree with the other reviewer - this book is heavy on academic verbosity. I could see this scaring away some potential readers."
4,Excellent collection ...,"Can't complain here ... a collection of all of the best early Humate singles and remixes. Of course, there's the classic trance opus: Paul van Dyk's ""Love Simulation"" Love mix. Then there's Humate's brilliant collaboration with Rabbit in the Moon: ""East"", and two parts of his ""3"" masterpiece (excluding the gorgeous ""3.2"" for some odd reason). These tracks still sound great even today! His remix of Oliver Lieb's (under the alias Paragliders) ""Bagdad"" is quite good as well.The last three songs don't do much for me though. Oliver Lieb's (this time under the alias Spicelab) ""Feather"" is not very interesting, and the two part ""1996"" just sounds dated and bad. Still, for how old some of this material is, this compilation is still a worthy purchase for those interested in checking out Humate's catalogue."
3,Breakage,The product is good - it produces a nice fragrant vanilla scent in the room that you place the reed diffuser in. The packaging that it comes in is pretty shabby. Many that I ordered arrived broken as they were only shipped in a flimsy plastic container.Other than that I am pleased.
4,Smells good,It took about two weeks to really fragrance my bedroom. It smells of lavender and it's a nice fragrance. Came packaged well and in time.
5,very helpfulAmazon made a,"Amazon screwed up my order, and this seller was very gracious in sending the correct item immediately."
2,Meh.,"The store has really good customer service, but the product didn't do anything for me. It smelled more of sugar than sandalwood."
2,Dissapointed,"I have purchased several reed diffusers and these ones are poor the reeds do not soak up the liquid as quickly as others, and consequently the perfume is not as strong as it should be."
2,not so much,The scent smells really nice but you can't even smell it unless you lean over the top of it. I've had reed diffusers before that you can smell as soon as you walk in the room but this one is not even close. Kinda waste of money.
4,Very impressive but.........,"I wish I could get a DVD of the New York Metropolitan Opera version done around 1978 and broadcast on PBS Live From the Met. That one, sung in English, blows this one away. But still, the Salzburg version is better than none at all!"
5,Great compact book,I have purchase two of these books already. One for German & the other for Italian.I have taken both books on several trips. I find them to be a compact & convenient way to check on translations.I would recommend them for a easy translation check on trips.
3,The Start Of Perfect Cell Saga,"This dvd contains 3 episodes:Episode 138:Sacrifice: As Cell mutates to his second stage affter asorbing Android 18, the more human-like warrior, sets his eyes on his next objective:Asorbing Android 18! But Tein, is lurking above, and will do anything to save the Earth from the incoming terror of Cell!Episode 139:Sayins Ermerge:As 16 and 18 escape from the destructive Cell, Goku and Gohan prepare to enter the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. In the meanwhile, Cell starts his hunt for 18, as Vegeta and Trunks ermerge from the chamber!Episode 140:Super Vegeta:As Cell continues his search for 18, the Sayin Prince appears to challenge Cell to a battle! Has Vegeta acctully transformed into a level beyond Super Sayin? Or is his bluff going to cost him his life?"
2,Not as up-to-date nor user-friendly,"We got the atlas for an 11-day trip to Minnesota, and ended up hardly using it at all.I've used many road atlases, as I prefer them to folding maps, but this one was more of a nuisance due to its size and unclarity.I also doubt its up-to-date-ness, as a couple of roads that looked promising in this atlas turned out to be non-existing or dislocated.To me, the most undesirable trait was the fact that it was quite unfriendly - graphically-speaking.Some main roads (and even freeways) were represented similarly to smaller roads (color and width), which required really exerting our eyes in order to figure out which is what.We drove ~2500 miles in Minnesota, and after a couple of attempts, the atlas ended up on the back-seat, and we switched to the AAA map we had with us, luckily.Disappointing."
2,Lock may not make bike rack as secure as you may think,"WORTH THE PRICE? Maybe not. The lock replaces one bolt. There are 3 other bolts that assemble the Allen bike rack I purchased. The lock bolt attaches the rack to the hitch. Another bolt can be removed to steal the rack. However, doing this would require the thief to somehow purchase the missing peice to attach it to another hitch. The missing piece may be cheaper than a full rack. Also, the nut for the lock bolt did not easily fit on the lock bolt. It wasn't machined properly. I used the bolt from the screw pin that came with the bike rack and it worked. Not sure if another manufacturers bolt would work."
1,broken already,Even though I hand tightened the nut on to the bolt it seized up on me when I tightened it with a wrench and then the head of the bolt snapped off. Cheap Chinese steel is what I assume was the problem. I'm looking for an American or European made lock. Any suggestions?
1,Poor quality,"Just like a few others, nut with plastic stuck on pin. Absolutely unremovable and will need to be cut off. Not much room to do it in but a recip saw may work. Crappy nut ruins product."
4,"Installed within a minute, no problems","I just purchased the 500L and installed to secure my Allen 555RR bike rack and the installation was very quick.1) You push the bolt thru the receiver hitch and Allen bike carrier 2)Screw on the nut with your fingers 3) hold the nut in place with a wrench 4) Turn the bolt with a socket wrench until the nut is tight 5) push the lock down on the bolt 5) Turn the key counter clockwise to lockI purchased this to deter someone from walking away with my entire bike rack when the car is parked for a long period of time. As far as locking the bikes, I can use a cable thru the metal loop on the Allen 555RR or the holes in my receiver hitch itself.I thought the price was a bit too high, otherwise I would give 5 stars. Will plan to update if anything changes as I use the product over time."
1,Be careful - pin replaced under warranty.,"Be careful - pin replaced under warranty. The Allen hitch has been fine. This locking hitch pin installed OK although it was stiff to put on. Taking it off resulted in the stop nut (with interior plastic collar) SEIZING and the hitch pin head broke loose and unscrewed - it is supposed to be permanently fixed to the pin! The nut is jammed but good so now I have to cut the pin off near the nut. Should take about an hour with a hacksaw and it won't be fun. When it's off, I'll use the original unlockable pin with a regular nut, not a stop nut. Now that I think about it, if you just use a regular 3/4"" nut on the locking pin, maybe with a lock washer for long trips, then you will probably be happier than I am right now.Later, the manufacturer replaced the pin under warranty and I think it will work fine as long as I use a plain replacement nut instead of the included stop nut. I would revise the rating to three stars but my initial rating seems permanent."
1,Terrible,"Bought this allen locking hitch pin to go along with the allen bike rack. Was suppost to be an anti-wobble locking pin, but did not keep it from wobbleing. The bike rack still moved and moved back and forth and mangled the latch for our pop-up camper and was unable to get the tongue of camper off ball on truck. Only made it out of my driveway for that to happen. Nightmare...Bike rack garbage along with locking hitch pin.Returned all products. And then $400.00 later to get pop-up camper fixed since could not be towed, had to have a service call come to us."
1,Nut seized up on first try - had to cut bolt!,"Amazon you should remove this item from your store. It is expensive and flawed. As many other reviewers have experienced, I couldn't remove the nut from the bolt after the first application. I had to cut the bolt with a Sawzall to remove. I got this for Xmas and didn't try it until yesterday so I am beyond my return date. Terrible experience all the way around!"
2,Nut seized and bolt came apart,While I was installing this for the first time the locking nut seized up on the nut. While trying to get the nut off the hex bolt head came un-welded from the bolt shaft. Not sure if this was a defect or the product of me putting a tremendous force on the bolt trying to get the nut off. If you get this you might want to spend about $2 at Lowes to get a standard nut and a locking washer.
5,Works as it should,Fits the receiver hole and it locks and unlocks fine. Only had it a month so I don't know if anything happens to it over time (e.g. corrosion)
4,Good enough lock. Wish they have a combo-lock version.,"I don't feel the lock is very secure, judging from the size of the key (small), but I guess it will help deter bad dudes from stealing the rack. It's a little inconvenient having to carry around another key. It works fine, and fit my Allen rack well."
4,Very secure,"The design makes this very secure. It even has a rain cover for the lock. It keeps my bike rack from swaying, rattling, or moving at all during transport. My only gotcha is that it requires a socket wrench and a combo wrench to tighten the lock nut. I wish there was a way to install it without other tools."
5,Allen Bike Rack Lock,"Found that with the Allen Bike Racks, you need too use this lock.It works great. Keeps the bike rack from wobling back and fourthas you drive down the road. Very little play once you put thislock/bolt on."
3,"..A compelling book on methods of the ""The art of LIFE""","During my years of administrating my own business, I had read many books relating to this common topic. And this book, is not just one of hundreds. It gives you real methods on modifying situation, to enhance our success. I believe its worth the time to read it, to improve leadership skill which are vital in this modern ""millennium"" time."
5,Lovely Hostess Set,"Different pieces of this set have come in handy almost every day since I purchased it. The pattern is beautiful and of good heavy Oneida quality. After numerous washings, they show no sign of wear. I will be purchasing more pieces of this pattern in the future."
2,Slides too much,"Great concept, but the mat slides all over the floor, pretty much no matter what you do. This basically ruins the game."
5,Lots of fun. Exhausting!,This game is a lot of fun. I'm fit and in my 30s and the beginner level is enough to get me moving. The feet sensors are closer together and good for kids too. Definitely recommended if you want an exhausting game.
5,Best blues rock slide ever!,"This guy is incredible. I bought his first album on the recommendation of a friend and was instantly hooked by the astounding slide playing that this guy is capable of. This album is just as good, with a great mix of hard blues rock, intricate dobro playing, and at times beautifully sweet melody.I met Sardinas after he opened for Steve Vai and he was such a cool guy - friendly, talkative and genuinely interested in who I was and what I thought of his music. This is a great album by a great guy, and even hardcore blues fans used to the more mellow side of blues will not be disappointed. I was only into mellow country and chicago blues before I heard Sardinas but he has opened my mind to the beauty of all blues, no matter how heavy or sweet they may be. Buy this now."
5,Techno how it was meant to be heard,"The legend of 90s techno hits you smack in the face with this collection of techno greatness.From melodic to down right furious, every track is superb.....dont sleep on Surgeon !!"
3,A solid 3.5 movie,"My only previous experience with Broken Lizard has beenSuper Troopers, which I thought was just fantastic. Although 'The Slammin' Salmon' has many funny moments, it just doesn't measure up to Troopers.The premise of the movie is simple, but as someone who has worked in a restaurant before, there were some hilarious truths. Michael Clarke Duncan plays an intimidating and irrational boxer who owns the Slammin' Salmon. He does an amazing job and really makes this movie worthwhile. The movie follows a great cast of restaurant wait staff competing to make the most money for the night to win a prize. There are so many conflicts and sub-plots that you are never bored. I have to say that the beginning of the movie moves kind of slowly but once it gets going, the laughs keep coming. I think it's a good movie to put on and watch with friends. Good times will be had!"
4,Pretty funny if this type of humor is your thing.....,"I had seen Beerfest on cable and thought I would give this movie a try. While not a true 'classic' of the genre , such as Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle for instance, it proved a fun way to kill some time the other evening with some friends. The plot is incidental to the performances and plethora of snappy one liners. Basically, if you have ever worked in a restaurant, you will most likely be amused by this film. The transfer to DVD is pretty darn good and it includes some very good special features including comprehensive commentaries. This movie is NOT Citizen Kane, but then again Citizen Kane is not The Slammin' Salmon! (whatever THAT means! ) Even at my advancing age of 55 ( !!) I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion."
3,"humerous, a good movie if you are looking to waste some time","I haven't seen SUPER TROOPERS or BEERFEST and this movie is from the same creators as those movies so I really didn't know what to expect.The movie was....funny. This isn't one for the family to watch, in fact I watched it while I was working and it was a funny distraction. There were parts of this that were incredibly funny and there were other parts where I almost turned it off.Would I buy it? Probably not, this is one of those movies that at least to me as no replay value. It will sit in my dvd library until I decide to get rid of it. I do imagine that when my wife's younger cousin comes to town he'll watch this and find it much funnier then I did."
2,Salmon gone off,"Basically this is a movie for those that like the genre of comedy, with physical and sexual and bathroom humor. It has everything, bad language and back stabbing as the wait staff tries to win a prize in Slammin' Cleon Salmon's (Michael Clarke Duncan of `The Green Mile' fame) restaurant...so the evening is shown with the customers and staff; with some guest spots by people such as Morgan Fairchild, eating their meals and the wait staff trying to make a huge amount of money.The DVD has English subtitles for hard of hearing and Spanish subtitles. There are outtakes of goofed lines over the end credits. There are two audio commentaries from the writer/director/actors and an extra of the movie trailer and one called 'Hellish Kitchens: Art Imitates Life' but the sound on that part was so bad, since it was recorded as they were riding in a van, I could barely under stand them.All total not a complete waste of time, but just not a great use unless you like this type of comedy."
2,Disappointed,This really was not a funny movie. I have pretty low standards but obviously not low enough. Their other movies are far more humourous.
5,Well done zany humor,"We have seen many of these comedic actors in movies such as Beerfest and they perform up to standards here as well. For those of us who appreciate crazy, outrageous humor, this movie should not disappoint. The only fault that I could find with the movie is a lack of variety of location. The entire movie takes place in the restaurant. This is a bit limiting, but they do just great with what they have. There are also plenty of extras, such as a featurette and two commentary tracks."
1,Very Broken Lizard,"At points, the Broken Lizard crew has put together decent films. Their theatrical releases have been at least watchable with a few decent laughs. This one which went straight to DVD did so for a reason. Just a poorly done movie from start to finish.One of the most interesting things about this movie is watching how far Michael Clarke Duncan has fallen. An Academy Award nominee just over a decade ago and he is related to the straight to DVD poop joke circuit. Frankly it is depressing, as is this movie."
4,slammin salmon,"This movie is hilarious! So many good scenes and quite a few big names in this one. I was skeptical at first because of the name, but this film turned out to be really funny."
4,Fun movie.,"This was a fun movie about a restaurant owned by a boxer. He needs money for a debt, so he puts his workers into a competition against each other to raise the money he needs. The result is a silly and goofy comedy. There is actually a good cast in this movie too.Michael Clarke Duncan - ""John Coffee"" from The Green Mile (not sure about that spelling)April Bowlby - she was Alan Harper's girlfriend in Two and a Half MenCobie Smulders - from How I Met Your MotherPaul Soter, Jay Chandrasekhar, and Erik Stolhanske from Super Troopersand a few others.No drama. Just a bunch of silliness. And I loved Michael Clarke Duncan in this."
4,Freaking Hilarious,"Thought this was a great movie. Has us laughing so hard it was dangerous. On par with Super Troopers. If you have ever worked in a restaurant before, this movie is for you. Definitely worth a watch, wouldn't hesitate to share with friends."
2,A broken broken lizard,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was ok, but just barely. The plot was a pretty bad idea in the first place. I really enjoyed Club Dread and Super Troopers, and thought Beerfest was decent. All of Slammin' Salmon took place inside the restaurant which got boring fast. Club Dread had a much better plot and scene. The highlight of the film, and really the only moments I laughed out loud were with Zongo."
2,Not Funny at All!,"I guess if you were a fan of Broken Lizard this might be a great comedy for you. A lot of the jokes were flat. Maybe it would be funnier if you had several drinks before you watched. If you do watch this movie don't eat out at a restaurant for a while. Maybe this movie is more for people aged 25 or less or younger than 17, Sorry it has a R rating. As an older adult it mainly falls flat. Of the 339 movies released in 2009 it ranked 322 and this was a Christmas season release! I don't even think the theatres wanted to show it! Don't waste your money on this or wait until it is in the $5 bin at WalMart. I hope that nice restaurants are not like this in the kitchen."
3,Sometimes you want a movie like this.,"This movie is implausible, filled with unpleasant people, and bases its humor on puerile slapstick and vulgar gags.But you know, sometimes you want a movie like that. For those occasions when you want a light movie with jokes about alcohol, drugs, and bodily functions, this is a good choice. It has interesting camera work, plenty of action, and relatively complex characters.The premise is this: a prizefighter turned restaurant owner needs extra cash, so he and the restaurant manager, with threats and bribes, cajole the miserable staff into competing to rack up the highest sales for the evening. In the course of their competition, they resort to sabotage and deceit. Shifting alliances, an assortment of restaurant patrons, and sheer luck keep the outcome a surprise until the end.Enjoy it."
2,"Makes ""Dumb and Dumber"" look smart","I can enjoy a good satire as well as anyone and can also laugh at a raunchy joke. But I found this film very juvenile as though these guys (""Broken Lizard Comedy Troupe""), had one too many beers and came up with a loose plot and said ""let's fill the script with a lot of F and S words and sell to high school or college audience. It's an R rated film so the high school kids can see it at home, since they couldn't see in the theater.You can read other reviews to give you the plot - as it is. If you laugh a lot when you hear the F and S words or like childish slapstick, you'll actually enjoy this I guess. We are only given 24 hours in every day. I can think of better things to use this time for than to watch this film. Then again, that's just this one person's opinion.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
2,The lizard is broken.,"I am so disappointed in this film.I've been waiting since 2002 for these guys to come up with something in the same league as Super Troopers and it just hasn't happened. Time after time I optimistically plop myself down in front of a Broken Lizard project and end up dejected two hours later. It's not fun, and it happened again tonight.The comedy is low-brow and juvenile; even awkward at times, and while there are some endearing moments, they were so few and far between that they made no difference. This is just a horribly ran comedy.I think it's time I came to terms with the fact that I'm not a Broken Lizard fan.Aside from Super Troopers, this crew is clearly failing.- t -21 June, 2010"
2,not up to their original standard,"The Slammin' Salmon is a mildly humorous attempt to document the comedies of daily life in a restaurant. The movie highlights Slammin' Cleon Salmon's attempt to pay off a gambling debt with one night of sales in his restaurant, all while seemingly inept employees are constantly sabotaging their own jobs and each other. The employees of the restaurant are promised a handsome reward if they are the top seller, getting Salmon to his goal of $20,000 in sales. The night ensues with crazy antics and wild attempts to coerce patrons into spending more money on top dollar items. Each employee is trying to one-up the other. Unfortunately, the movie lacks consistent comedy and leaves the viewer with relatively few moments of laughter. The creators of Super Troopers really did not provide a solid encore performance with this movie. I'm glad that I don't have to eat there!"
4,"Funny, but not Beerfest or Super Troopers funny","I thought this was a much better movie than Club Dread, but based on the reviews here I was expecting it to be as good as Super Troopers.I think it is the type of movie that you need to see more than once to appreciate everything in the movie. Over all it was a decent movie that definately had it's funny moments. Though it did feel a little low budget at times.Solid B effort on thier part."
2,The Slammin' Salmon Lacks Punch,"Broken Lizard has created a cult following with mildly funny comedies on the cheap, their latest of which is The Slammin' Salmon, a movie that just never comes together. Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile) gets plenty of laughs as the owner of the Slammin' Salmon and former Heavyweight champion who seemed to have a few screws punched loose during his days as a boxer. As does April Bowlby (Drop Dead Dive) as an over eager waitress. But the actual members of Broken Lizard, as waiters and cooks in a contest not to be fired, bring nothing to the film. And cameos by Olivia Munn, Morgan Fairchild, Vivian A Fox, and Will Forte fall flat."
4,tribute or rip-off?,"I watched this movie about a year ago, and really thought it was funny, especially Michael Clarke Duncan. Now I'm watchingIn the Weedsand thinking, hey this is exactly the same movie... I get that these guys poke fun at movies/genres, but this is a little to literal. Anyways, it does take ""In the Weeds"" to a new level of ridiculousness, but not too far to be enjoyable. It's not exactly a smart movie, but has some good laughs."
5,This movie is hilarious.,I don't understand why everyone is downing this movie. I watched it last night and bought it today. I thought it was perfect. I haven't laughed at a movie that hard in a long time. I highly recomend this movie.
4,Very Funny Movie,"First off: Don't buy it on Blu-Ray. There is no reason to, and you can save a few bucks if you just buy it on regular DVD. The movie itself is very entertaining. It has a breezy tone that is great. The characters are all funny, especially Nuts. Broken Lizard movies hinge on the chemistry of the actors, and where they faltered with ""Club Dread"", they succeeded with ""The Slammin' Salmon"". All the actors work well together, with major props going to Michael Clarke Duncan. He was much funnier than I was expecting, and had some of the best lines. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for an entertaining, light-hearted comedy."
4,bought as a requested gift - no complaints on my end,"bought as a requested gift - no complaints on my end, didn't watch it myself so I can't speak for content"
4,Historically significant,"The harmonica work and field holler interplay by Terry on Lost John makes this album. Granted Woodie Guthrie's vocals are a little hard to take, but given the debt popular music owes to the man, we should all be thankful he never lost the desire to sing.He is, by the way, the Hank Hill sound-alike that ""A Music Fan"" is talking about. I'll be willing to bet Woodie was never mocking the music."
1,hank hill mocks the prisoners,the title of this cd is very mis-leading. There is mostlya guy who sounds like hank hill mocking the chain-gangmusic idiom.
3,"Leftist, but in a good way.....","I'm inclined to disagree with the reader form New York - while I can't imagine Campbell ever liking much about the Reagan administration's foreign policy, I nonetheless believe that his work asks questions which are not easily (read: comfortably) answered in american foreign policy.That being said, this is NOT a book for the reader uninitiated to either abstractly theoretical examinations of internation political science, or to the postmodern/poststructuralist philosophy project.All the same, though, a fascinating read for those in the field, or with an interest..."
1,Writing security is Campbell's politics repackaged,"Campbell would probably be more persuasive if he were up-front enough to admit that he simply dislikes Reagan, Bush, and US social and foreign policy in general. Instead, he throws a superficial veneer of deconstruction over the discussion of various domestic and foreign events (e.g., war on drugs). He so easily exposes what he claims are others' motives, but is too hypocritical to admit his own. This book is not worth the time or money to read."
1,Entends tu less chiens aboyer? Vangelis,"This cd was manufactured wrong...the second half of this cd (part2) is actualy La Fete Sauvage, and even this is not in its entirety...so such a sad mistake."
3,Good Movie,Definitely no academy performances but it was a good movie for as long as it was. If they would have had more of Petra (Yamen) Jamen in the movie it would have been even better!!!!!
2,waste of time,what is up with these remakes ?this one was not interesting one bittreat williams is a good actor but this movie is garbage !
3,Indiana Jones Meets Lost World,"1999 version of Journey To The Center of The Earth combined from TV drama series is not the usual dramatization of Jules Vernes classic. It is a bit skewed by recent movies such as Jurassic Park series. The location of the vocano is changed from Iceland to New Zealand hidden sanctuary to Mauri tribes. What surprises us most is human-like dinosaur as a result of ""parallel evolution"", which in itself is intriguing idea.Verdict: Even being Jules Vernes novel fan the movies offer some surprises.Rating: 75 out of 100. If the director ever able to revive the old Mauri tradition, he should get the Mrs. Hastings change her dress more fit to the journey."
1,Jouney to Nowhere,This was a poor adaptation of the original 1959 version. Good things come to those who wait. Hopefully the original will be released soon!
2,Long Day's Journey into Nothing..........,"Any resemblance between this and the original Jules Verne classic is purely unintentional, an accident at best. That they strayed from the source material is evident the moment this epic begins. That they had no desire to lay claims to anything but Verne's title is also evident. A cynic would push that suspicion one step further by stating the obvious; they hoped to cash in on Verne's book and its reputation. Which makes this a cheat, fraud at the worst. When certain expectations are offered but not given, purposely, that's the definition of a swindle.All that aside, this is simply not a good feature; the title is the best thing about it. The journey aspect was brief and then they became landlocked, embroiled in a get rich quick scheme (seven years in the making, something that was not explained in the story).They should have named this movie something else so I wouldn't have bothered buying it. Not a keeper."
2,Journey to the Center of Ennui,"This movie is not bad enough to be good and not good enough for a second viewing. The acid test for many movies is ""do you care about the characters"". I found myself wishing that the monsters at the Center of the Earth would eat Treat Williams and his co-stars quickly, to avoid a 3 hour slog full of wooden acting, stilted dialogue and primitive special effects. I agree that the human-like lizard monsters were pretty cool, and the whole center of the earth environment was pretty cool. Trim this puppy down to a solid 70 minutes and you might have had a cult classic - but alas, not a mini-series. If you can buy a used copy for about the price of a video store rental, as I did, then it is still worth a purchase. One thumb half way up is better than none."
1,TERRIBLE!,This movie is so bad. The orginal with Pat Boone and James Mason is so much better. I can't understand why it is not on DVD.
4,"Perhaps no classic as the original, but...","...my expectations were low, I haven't seen the original or red the book - so I actually enjoyed this movie. It's not Lord Of The Rings, but the effects are actually rather good, it starts a little slow, but after 30 minutes or so it becomes rather entertaining - the acting could have been better, but the cast function ok for a tv-production - I really liked the ""underworld-ocean"", in my opinion it looks beautiful, and the blue forest as well - the green creatures are done very good - but if you are curious on this movie, don't expect too much from a tv-production like this one is, but if you like adventure and fantasy - you might enjoy it as I did. It's highly recommended fot those who like Hallmark-productions."
4,A light fantasy,"Okay, this movie will definitely offend Verne purists, so if you are looking for a straight-from-text adaptation of the story, skip over this film. However, if you are like me, and have no other expectations for a made-for-tv-movie than it be enjoyable and the actors don't grate on your ears, check this movie out. I thought it was hilarious. The costumes and scenery are definitely out there and the whole story is a light-hearted fantasy. Plus, it's got two love plotlines (both with men pining for supposedly unattainable women). Sure, you know how it will end, and yes, it is not one of the most intelligent plots, but it's not boring or annoying! I thought it was sweet and humorous. Parents with kids, the special effects and dinosaurs will keep 'em entertained and you'll find it amusing enough to stay awake."
3,Opinion of Journey to the center of the earth,The dvd was fine but it did not have closed caption capability. That would have given it 5 stars. For people with severe hearing capabilities CC is a must.
3,Corny but Good!,This isn't an oscar winning film but it's entertaining and fun if you like the Hercules or Zena Series type of shows. Same bad acting but for some reason I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the book even though it was altered alot. I guess so they could film in New Zealand. Don't expect alot from this film just simple fun!
1,Pretty bad.....,"....This is a bad movie, but I must clear something up. THIS IS NOT FROM THE DIRECTOR OF ""THE ROAD WARRIOR""! This is from the director of ""Zeus And Roxanne"". They're both named George Miller, but they are different people. One is from Australia and one is not. That is all."
2,Where is the original version in DVD,"This movie was OK,.... But of all the trashie movies put to DVD... Why can't we get a classic like the 1959 Journy to the center of the earth put on DVD. I would buy it right away, like now if I could. Oh well,... I'll just keep coming back and checking every 6 months or so. At least they got the Time machine on DVD. NO DVD COLLECTION WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT BOTH OF THEM!!!"
4,Great Adventure Film,"My wife and I were pleasantly surprised. We were afraid it would be a cheesy, low budget film with terrible special effects. We found it a well made production which really transported us to another interesting and exciting world with believable characters. It apparently put people off by its claim to be based on Verne's classic. It is, sort of, but if anything it owes a lot to Burroughs Pellucidar as well. One thing I liked is that the creatures live in an environment which could possibly support them. Something laughable in a recent film is a huge dinosaur and carnivorous plants in a landscape which doesn't look like you could find a rabbit. The lighting problem is somewhat explained but then, this is more science fantasy than hard core science fiction. We get a big dose of now discredited Darwinism which gives it an authentic 19th century atmosphere. I thought the lizard men were great, certainly after seeing so many costumed Gorillas in older films. All in all, a good four!"
1,Absolutely awful adventure film.,"Unbelievably cheesy adventure film stars Treat Williams as an explorer searching for a missing man, which eventually leads him to another world underground. Potentially enjoyable miniseries features a handful of awe-inspiring scenes, but is sunk by second-rate direction, terrible acting (Even from the typically reliable Williams) and writing, horrendous special effects, a grating musical score, and an uninteresting main conflict. You know you're in trouble when the opening fistfight is as badly choreographed as a 70's chop-socky flick!"
1,How could they make such a bad movie!,Whoever directed this movie should find a new career. It is terrible. I don't understand why the orginal with Pat Boone is not on DVD. It does deserve 5 stars.
3,Journey to the Center of the Earth,"Journey to the Center of the EarthI think this was a little disappointing but still, good fantasy"
2,The Original was better,"This movie was okay, but the original version of it was great! I would buy the original in a heartbeat if they ever release it on DVD."
2,"okay at the start, but then","they spend too much time at the center of the earth and that's where things start falling apart...hohum...really bad... Like what the other reviewers said, I also wish they release the original Journey to the Center of the Earth by Boone and Mason."
2,Journey to the centre of boredom,"I quite enjoy Hallmark's tv series. They release remakes and adaptations of enjoyable fantasy movies and legends with a modern twist and great effects. Naturally I saw their stamp on this DVD and thought ""Great!"" Oh dear....what a shame.This movie tries hard to be interesting and it is watchable, but only just. Explorers searching for a missing doctor make their way to the centre of the earth and get caught up in a conflict between two prehistoric races. There is almost nothing from Jules Verne's classic story here, as has been mentioned already, but I found even for a fan of fantasy this was much less than what I expected. I think it is fair to say that Hallmark relied on the cast and title to sell the movie rather than a decent script. It's lazy, uninspired and often very dull."
1,Let's have the original with James Mason,"As a fan of the James Mason/Pat Boone version I had hopes for this adaptation of the Verne novel. I wish amazon had the option to give movies no stars, because this movie isn't even worth one star."
1,Where it the original?,Why can't we have the original version with James Mason and Pat Boone? It is one of may all-time favorite movies. This one doesn't do much for me.
2,Barely Watchable,"This movie has a few good points such as it plods along and has some decent scenes like the Amazons fighting the men, the lizard men stalking them, and the evil husband they came in search of getting killed. Hallmark once again you have taken a classic story that all ready had a great movie of it and you made a second rate copy. On it's best day it can't hold a candle to the 1959 version with James Mason and Pat Boone. I can only hope since another great movie, Mysterious Island, is finally coming out on DVD October 29th, that perhaps they will put the original Journey to the Center of the Earth on DVD as well soon. Then this one won't get any interest at all."
1,Absolutely awful adventure film.,"Unbelievably cheesy adventure film stars Treat Williams as an explorer searching for a missing man, which eventually leads him to another world underground. Potentially enjoyable miniseries is sunk by terrible acting (Even from the typically reliable Williams), horrible writing, horrendous special effects, a grating musical score, and an uninteresting main conflict. You know you're in trouble when the opening fistfight is as badly choreographed as a 70's chop-socky flick!"
3,Only have a movie,"I did enjoy the movie, I had it on VHS, so when I upgraded to the DVD; the two copies I tried only showed a little more than half of the movie.Amazon.com was kind enough to refund my money.In the meantime I can my VHS copy away, I would like the DVD, but I don't want to get another bad copy."
5,Cheryl St. John is wonderful!,I enjoyed this book tremendously and I would give it 6 stars if I could. The characters were well developed and I have decided that Ms. St. John offers a gauranteed good read! This is the type of book that makes your heart sigh and you feel what the characters are going through. Cheryl St. John is wonderful!
2,Not that helpful,"I should have read the description more closely. This bit, ""when de Carle first set out to write Practical Watch Repairing in 1946"" would have prevented me from buying it. I'll be giving this one to the library - or putting it in the recycle bin."
2,Practical Watch Repairing,"I have found this book extremely difficult to read. It is worded like it is the 1900's, too wordy and hard to follow. I find I have to read the same lines over and over to comprehend and it is hard to keep my concentration.Not too pleased with this purchase."
1,Not for Novice Watch repairmen,Practical Watch RepairingMuch to detail and busy text for the novice user. Pictures are to small to really be very useful in simple repairs.
1,Book: Practical Watch Repairing,"I didn't pay much for this book, and I just wanted something basic, you know, hobby stuff. It's ok, but way too wordy. And here's the kicker: YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THIS BOOK FREE ON THE INTERNET!"
3,Not What I Expected,"This is a very good book for working on the watches of antiquity... you know, the wind ups. But, if you are looking for a primer on repairing battery watches...LOOK ELSEWHERE!!! The information included regarding modern watches is severely limited. Maybe I'll relist this book and sell it as slightly used."
2,Practical Watch Repairing (Hardcover),"I wanted a book that would help me understand and at the end allow me to repair or clean, oil and adjust a watch. This book didn't do it. It says you can start as a beginner. Wrong. Regardless of what other reviewers say, you will not end up disassembling and reassembling a vintage wristwatch. The material is too old and does not cover how you can do the tasks mentioned in the book with today's technology. You'll wind up falling to sleep."
5,Practical Watch Repairing,"My husband says this is the best ""watch repair"" book he has seen. The book came within a few days after ordering. He has an antique pocket watch belonging to his grandad that he has needed information as to how to repair. The book was very instumental...now the problem is ""where to get parts for a watch over 100 years old."""
1,Book is about old movements....,If you are looking for a book about newer automatic movements and newer information look elsewhere. While the book itself is new in condition and print. The material is dated and quite old. It reads like it was written 100yrs ago.
3,"try to use it, didn't have the patience to read it","more or less a training manual in my eyes. tried to read it for some specific information, but lost interest. still will use it as I have watches still in need of repair and several jewelers said they wouldn't fix them for various reasons."
3,its okay,I think this book helps some but for a beginner like me it isn't what i was looking for. I wanted something that would provide very basic information and eventually bought a beginners book.
2,Practical watch repairing,"Very old material, lots of detail going nowhere, not easy reading nor clear in meaning or directions of use, not for beginners"
2,Watch Repair Book,"I expected more, I don't think that this book would teach someone with little knowledge of watches how to repair their own watch."
2,Watch Repair Book,"I ordered then promptly returned this book to Amazon. Save your money, folks. The pictures are antiquated and the commentaries of ""how to"" repair your watch are looooong. If you like visuals with 1, 2, 3 directions like this: ""1. Get your tool, 2. Place it on your watch like this, 3. Turn it clockwise like this..."" then you're better off googling the directions with your newly bought Watch Repair Kit which you undoubtedly are thinking of buying with this book. I paid shipping to get this book, then paid shipping to send it back. Almost the cost of the entire book. Ugh!"
1,no for dummies,Do no buy this if you are not a repair watch professional. I just want to replace the watch batery but not instruction wich tool to use.again I do not recommend to a dummy.
5,Great Book,"If you are looking for a book to help you learn the art of watch repair this is the one, great book."
2,"Great service, book lacking somewhat","The service was top notch. The book was ok, but did not contain enough detailed information for a beginner like me. Still can't open one of my watch cases to replace a battery.Fred Rosser"
3,"Older reprint, disappointing","While this book is widely touted on watch repair ""training"" websites it is not exactly the easiest read or mostly clearly detail how-to book I have ever used. It is a good reference, and I am not sorry I purchased it, but I wish I had some thing a little more clearly written. For example, the author frequently refers to parts and assemblies that he never shows."
1,Total waste of time!,"I didn't spend any money on this. I watched a copy I obtained from the Library. Even though it was free & only 84 minutes long, I still feel cheated. This movie is terrible. Every scene is dragged out. I guess the reason Jerry Lewis is such a hit in France is reflected in the ""humor"" of this offering. Do not spend any money on this. If you must,waste your time only."
1,Boring.,"If you are between the ages of 0 months and 3 years of age or 75 years or older you might find this ' waste of time' to be a thought provoking, star making stunner (what a joke)! What's annoying about on line reviews like this is that it seems like any positive reviews are being written by the people responsible for tricking us into renting it. This, this sorry excuse for an after school special is A WASTE OF TIME, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT A REAL MOVIE WITH REAL TALENT, THERE IS NOT SHRED OF TALENT ANYWHERE WITH THIS MESS."
3,Honeybee,"The film is remarkably well-acted and believable, except perhaps for the ending. Although the boxing scenes are obviously staged, the impact of the film is quite authentic and insightful, particularly for a young female who may be thinking about the boxing world as an avenue to pursue. One scene is sexually graphic and may ""put off"" gifting this film to unsophisticated recipients. I'm and experienced granddad and bought the film for my 17-year-old granddaughter who is just beginning to spar.Honeybee"
5,Excellent,Service is impeccable. Christmas present was so appreciated.My friend was extatic.Packaging & delay were absolutely beyond expectations.Bravo
3,Very Disappointing,"There is absolutely nothing new on this CD, and seeing as that the digital remastered reissue came out only a couple years back, I essentially bought the same CD twice. The packaging is very nice, and the bonus tracks have been on the Rykodisc CDs since the Eighties. The version of ""Holy Holy"" is not the original single version (which evidently has fallen off the face of the earth), and the remaining ""Arnold Corns"" tracks have eluded official release. It seems that either the vaults have closed, or no one is really trying anymore. I'll stick to the bootlegs."
4,Classic Bowie album not given classic treatment,"Ziggy ranks as one of Bowie's best albums and, in fact, definitely deserves to be on the millenium list. What troubles me is the lack of thought put into this reissue by EMI. The sound is terrific, but this reissue lacks the bonus tracks on both the Rykodisc version and the first reissues by EMI (which, for all intents and purposes, duplicated the Rykodisc version). I'd hold off buying this album until they issue it on a music DVD since. I have the feeling EMI will add the bonus tracks back again as a marketing ploy to convince fans to plunk down more cash for something you already have.Taking advantage of your fans David, Emi shame on you! I've knocked this down a star for the shabby way EMI has reissued this (in much the same way they reissued the first batch of Beatles albums)."
2,5.1 Surround mix is just not good.,"There are some great tracks on this LP. But, I bought this for the 5.1 surround disc. If you are thinking of buying it for the surround mix, do not. It's just not done well. The low end is gutted. Stray sounds appear randomly from different speakers for no reason. Vocal levels are all over the place. You'll never listen to this 5.1 disc."
5,ill be a rock n rollin b**** for you,When i first bought this album i didnt know what i was in for because i never bought a bowie album before so i figured i would start with this one and what a great album i found i loved the album from start to finish not a disappointing song on this album in fact i stayed up all night long and listened to it like three times and then the fourth on my headphones and it sounded even better what a great 1972 release i love bowies voice he has a great voice just listen to him in the labryinth that movie displays why he is such a good singer the piano in lady stardust is amazing i love that song i know bowie plays a 12 string guitar but i wonder if he plays piano too if he does that just makes him better in my eyes moonage day dream is a rock n roller and a very good song anyways great album i loved it from the very first time i heard it mick ronson is the guitar player and he just plain rocks this album what a great guitar player he is
2,Overrated!,"Now, I know I'm probably gonna get beat up for saying this, BUT i dont particularly care for this CD. I'm a huge Bowie fan and I have most of this CDs. Maybe it's dated, or maybe I just dont understand early Bowie all that well, but I was very dissapointed in this album. After all the hype, I expected a listening extravaganza, but it didn't quite happen.I like Scary Monsters, Low, Outside, and Station to Station much better. These are stand-out stellar cds. Get those instead.Ok, now you guys can rag on me all you want."
2,"Pleased his teen fans, not his best.","The stage persona of Ziggy is one of the most famous images in rock. But is this a great album?I suggest Hunky Dory, or his tryptich (low/heroes/lodger), or even Scary Monsters. All have more complex and interesting songs. Ziggy itself is a great song. Soul love, Starman have memorable offbeat syncopation with the guitar, but much of Ziggy is done better elsewhere.If there was one record of Bowie's to get, this would not be it, though this is probably his most famous work.It is funny to see how androgynous Bowie was, to say the least, and then suddenly in the macho 1980s he made a big goof of it in interviews. Rock's Chameleon for you."
2,No Thanks,"This album has always been over-rated. Bowie only had 3 or 4 decent songs from the 70's (Fame, Golden Years,Changes). Most of his stuff from that era was just glam garbage that appealed mostly to British teens who couldn't seem to get enough of all those self-absorbed, self-important and mostly over-rated glam acts like T-Rex, Slade, The Sweet, Sparks and Gary Glitter. Most of Bowies albums from the 80's are FAR superior!"
2,"Over-rated, over-played radio pop -- but it is catchy","People rave and rave over this but I just don't quite get it.Would anyone have listened to this if it weren't for the image that went along with it? Well, OK, probably, after all it is catchy -- however I doubt nearly as many people would have taken notice. The music on its own is kind of irritating. I still can't deny there are some good hooks like the main guitar riff from ""Ziggy Stardust"". However there is just some kind of sickly sweet quality to a lot of the music, mostly in the vocals, which just bugs me somehow. The first time I heard nearly all of these songs I felt it, and it grows with repeated listens."
2,Hang Ziggy!,"Probably the most overrated performer of all times, Mr. Bowie is a perfect mystery. While there are moments when his genius clearly shines through (Life on Mars, Space Oddity, All the Madmen, Kooks, notably The Man who sold the World and few more)it remains a pretty frustrating thing to like him overall.I saw him live couple years ago and he really pulled the crowd's strings, undeniably an incredible showman. What about Ziggy Srardust then? A classic rock and roll album topped with Bowie's characteristic juicy English eccentricity.That's all fine, but why should everybody go raving mad about it?I'm utterly perplexed.At the time of its release much more talented bands like Led Zeppelin and The Who were in full swing, Queen were just starting to gain prominence, but people still paid much more attention to the thin white duke.Oh well, must have been his make up..."
3,Less than fantastic ?,Compared to DeepPurple Machine Head and Pink Floyd The Dark side of the Moon in MCH mix I found this Ziggy mix less impressive.
5,Amazing!,I recieved the cd in perfect condition and it was delivered in good timing. I was very satisfied and will use this company again.
5,"Boy,Can He Play Guitar","The first 70's Bowie I just added to my collection and was it well worth it.Having owned many of his 80's and 90's stuff,it was time to dig deep to the ""Classics"" as they are.From beginning to end,just a strong and amazing album.Soul Love,Moonage Dream,Starman,Lady Stardust,Star to Ziggy Stardust and Suffragette City. It is just an amazing album from a Legend.If you are a Bowie fan and ready to dig deep,start off with this one.The others will follow after you buy this one.A solid 5 from me..Raw and amazing!!!!Buy it now,it is never too late."
5,Simply...THE BEST,"I feel that this particular album by David Bowie, would have to be his finest. Not only can he combine silly lyrics and a strange idea into a great album, but he does it great. Some Favorites would be Starman, Ziggy Stardust, Five Years, Soul Love, and Sufferagette City. This is Bowie in his prime people, so understand that this is a great buy for any fan of Rock or Pop.~^*Sam^*~"
5,Ziggy makes history,"There are only four CD's that I will listen to completely: ""The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust"", ""Low"", ""A Night at the Opera"", and ""Innuendo"" (the last 2 ablums are by Queen.) Released in early 1972, not long after ""Hunky Dory"", this album introduced us to a character: Ziggy Stardust. David Bowie and his mates outdo themselves on this album. Bowie is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and this album is a must for rock fans.1. Five Years (9.5/10)2. Soul Love (8/10)3. Moonage Daydream (8/10)4. Starman (9/10)5. It Ain't Easy (8.5/10)6. Lady Stardust (9/10)7. Rock and Roll Star (9/10)8. Hang on to Yourself (9/10)9. Ziggy Stardust (10/10)10. Suffragette City (9/10)11. Rock and Roll Suicide (10/10)David Bowie is the most beautiful rocker from his time (and Freddie Mercury...), and I will always love him. I recomend this album to anyone who likes classic 70's rock, or is looking to add to their Bowie collection."
4,"Overrated, but still very good","Well, I'm a huge Bowie fan, and I really like this CD. But I think that those who tell it's the best Bowie has ever done are wrong. To my mind ""Hunky Dory"" (THIS is Bowie's best) or even ""Aladdin Sane"" are better. Indeed, ""Soul love"" and ""It ain't easy"" are quite annoying and the whole disc is a little repetitive. But don't forget this is the one with ""Starman"",""Lady Stardust"",""Rock'n roll suicide"". So, one day, you will have to buy it..."
5,His masterpiece,"I still remember when about 10 years ago I found this old LP owned by my uncle and he told me:listen!!!I was about 15 and didn't like music at all.Well I changed idea.Here there are some truly masterpieces: the soft ""Five years"" ,""ziggy stardust"",""lady stardusyt"",""starman"".Hey people this cd is just story...you're only loosing time with other stuff!!!"
2,A classsic...,"...All of the material could have easily been fit ontoone disc and the packaging is shoddy. This album, in its original for or the RYKO release, are a must for any seriousmusic listener, which is why I gave it two stars."
2,A Waste.,"And for the 100th time we get another release of 'The Rise & Fall Of Ziggy Stardust...""I got this in several incarnations over the years- the Ryko Gold disc, which too me is the best version out there, and the 30th anniversary edition which has the best packaging.This set doesn't sound much better to justify another purchase.Bowie/E. Costello/E.John- enough with the re-releases of the same cds over and over.Each time the artist/label will claim that 'this is the way it's suppose to sound'- so does that mean you've been selling poorly sounded cds over the past 20 years.This cd is just another ripoff.If u don't own it, then get this. The review is based on the labels constant re-releases of the same material over and over.Don't bother.----The Album is one of the best ever but you can find it available in a better sounding and cheaper version on Amazon."
2,Most of the songs don't wear well,"Sure Ziggy Stardust and Suffragette City still stand as great songs...but primarily fans of the early Rolling Stones will appreciate the rest of the period-specific music approach. If you haven't purchased this album, I strongly suggest you listed to all the previews and then decide whether this is your cup of tea. So, I'm not writing this review from a historical perspective and this review doesn't reflect the historical significance of this album in the annals of Rock, but rather whether it's worth listening to today on its own terms...and in that regard I find it lacking."
5,"Another re-issue, WORTH IT","It's a shame that another re-issue, this time on an Enhanced CD, has made my Bowie collection obsolete. I have the Ryko Versions with the extra cuts and enjoy them a lot!ZIGGY STARDUST is one of the Great rock albums! If you don't have it...now's the time!Tom (Panic) in Detroit"
5,This is one of the most revolutionary albums ever.,"David Bowie invetned glitter rock. It is a masterful style. This album contains the hit ""Ziggy Stardust,"" about a plastic rock star's descent from glory. I also liked ""Suffragette City"" and ""John, I'm Only Dancing."""
5,One of the most entertaining album ever,"This is an album that must be heard to believe it. Calling it epitome of glam-rock does not say anything. From start to finish, it is such an unusual experience that I have no idea how to describe it. I though album like ""Heroes"" cannot be topped, I was a fool because Ziggy can do anything. Although the album has to be listened in its entire but even the single tracks are brilliant. Apar t from the hit ""Starman"", the other standouts are usual rocker ""Suffragette City"", ""Soul Love"".No, can't even find a good track here, all are either very good or excellent. I am quite sure this is a great starting point to Bowie's music. I agree with most of the world, that it is a masterpiece which cannot be ignored. I fail to understand why the most entertaining album of all time has not sold too many copies.This particular version is remastered with good artworks. Get it without any hesitation, you won't regret if you like rock n' roll in general."
3,Could have been Better,"For a 40th Anniversary Re-issue this doesn't quite hit the mark if you are a collector.Having several versions that have been released this is not my favorite. Why couldn't it have been done,as before with extra tracksand better packaging,say like with a good booklet. But still worth having."
3,Doesn't add to or detract from the original album,"I give this edition the same ""score"" as I do the original album. I think the extra disc neither adds to nor detracts from the presentation of the original.I do wish that ""Sweet Head"" had made the original cut. It is so much rawer than anything that wound up on the album (not that ...Ziggy Stardust... was ever intended to be raw).Holy Holy is also quite pleasing and contains an unmistakable, dramatic Bowie chord sequence."
4,"Innovative, fresh, catchy...","One of my favourite albums, 'Ziggy Stardust' is indeed more than a novelty. Intangibly linked with a fiction created by Bowie, its songs resonate with glam, style and overall a sense of enjoyment. 'Starman' is an unforgettable soaring ballad, 'Star' has an unforgettable melody while Suffragette City is also great. Not so great were Five Years, Lady Stardust and Rock and Roll Suicide. Overall, an album EVERYONE with even a faint interest in music should have in their collection."
5,The one and only; The Great - Ziggy Stardust!,"If youre a big music fan like myself, you have to own a copy of this album in your collection. From '5 years' to 'Rock n Roll Suicide' gives you inspiring melody and and great lyrics. Plus I think vocaly wise this is Bowie's finest work. If I would of produced a greatest hits by this man, 90% of this album would be in it. Also check out 'John I'm only dancin' which is a b-side. Classic stuff."
2,"great album, terrible remastering",I was very excited when this CD remaster came out but I use it as an example of how to ruin a great record with a poor remastering. Get the old version on LP and enjoy it that way until they remaster it again.usuallyplesant
5,Visionary.,"Although David Bowie and his band were more polished than the punk rockers, this album is more intense than any punk rock you can hear and it has form and meaning as well. I've heard that the story of Ziggy Stardust is the story of Jimi Hendrix but I think there's more to it than biography (or even autobiography). David Bowie created a novel rock n' roll persona with a distinct vision of the world, and a sound that was melodious but was also as thunderous as any heavy metal or punk rock you've ever heard."
4,Freaky!,"This is a strange album. I got it on CD, with about four bonus tracks. The one above you is not that CD, but I think I saw it on the way here...Anyway, the album's quality is at its peak (in my opinion) with numbers 1,2,3,4, and 11. The others are good as well, but those five are really my favorites. They're melancholy, but they're telling the story of Ziggy Stardust in a really subtle manner. Good! Still, I deducted a star because, it's, well, it's a pretty pretentious album. Most progressive rock stars were for some reason. That's okay, though, because the music matches up."
5,Gorgeous,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. terrific music all over, one of the best albums ever...if you've never listened to it, you are seriously missing out."
5,classic bowie :),"If you're a new David Bowie fan, this is the perfect first cd for you to buy... This is very quality songwriting here and this is a masterpiece. ""Five Years"" is one of my favorite songs EVER. ""Lady Stardust"" is another stand out track and ""Rock n Roll Suicide"" is just simply fabulous. This is a cd that you can listen to start to finish over and over and over..."
5,One of the Best Concept Albums of All Time,"You know, this isn't really an entire concept album devoted to Ziggy (well, yeah, it is) as there are some transitional songs. But all of 'em are great. Five Years, Moonage Daydream, Suffragette City, and especially Starman and the title track...all great songs. Say, Amazon, where's that Bowie Essential Recordings List? I've only got three records, and all I could say is that this is a winner.Ranks up there with Tommy, Dark Side of the Moon and Sgt. Pepper. My next project is Arthur by the Kinks."
5,A lovely start to The legend of Bowie,I am big classic rock and progressive rock fan but had somehow how not been acquainted with David Bowie music at all ... so i was wondering should i start with the best of or go for some of his studio albums Well i purchased Ziggy Stardust and i was absolutely surprised as this album contains some amazing music ...absolutely every song is a classic...the album contains mostly rock numbers ...it contains some good jazzy ones as well . The album starts off with 5 years which after one listen u just cant get it out of your head ...the fast rock nos are great as well and the ending Rock and Roll Suicide is just an amazing ending to an amazing album. I just loved this album ... a great start to david bowie ....now i have to buy more david bowie stufff soon..
2,5 star record - 1 star for massive error,"We all know this is a landmark album, we all agree on that point.However....The ENTIRE STEREO L - R CHANNELS ARE REVERSED!!! Not just one song, EVERY SONG!Many are wondering how does it sound? I am a sound geek, here is my take. The bass and drums are a touch muddier and have more warmth then the previous releases. I think that is good because Bowie's vocals are more prominent in the mix giving each song more bite. The older pressings on cd have more of a vintage feel. This is basically Ziggy Stardust version 2.0 for a new audience.But still, how can you have the sound channels reversed?"
5,I LOVE IT...BUT I RETURNED IT TWICE,"I won't even try to explain what a brilliant and important recording this is. Previous reviews have done that. I write simply as a heads up about the manufacturing quality of the record its self. Amazon is very sensitive about their shipment of records and developed that swell shipping box. It works great. I think the two albums I've had in the last week were bad before they ever got packed. The first record was visibly bowed before I cut the shrink wrap. The record was the same shape. It would not sit on the turntable. OK, back to Amazon. Record two looked good from the outside. It sat nicely on the turntable. Side one was glorious. Side two skipped on the first band. Not an up and down bump but a side to side one. With every revolution the needle was shaken side ways. So, again, back it goes. This is the first bad record I've gotten here so no hard feelings but this is an album I have to have. I'll wait a month and maybe they'll get a new batch."
4,A great recording,"I initially got this CD because I had heard some of the songs on various compilation albums (Cameron Mackintosh's ""Hey Mr. Producer,"" especially). I was surprised by how much I like this show. Elaine Stritch is, of course, delightful in her role. I like the original ""Being Alive"" better than the Larry Kent version at the end of the CD.This CD is filled with many songs that take you through the life of Robert, and how he interacts with his married friends. It illustrates a life at a precise moment. I think that Sondheim & Prince did a wonderful job of bringing it to life.Pick up your own copy and listen to it in one sitting the first time--it is definitely an experience."
3,"Company, the Musical CD","Excellent musical. The original cast is talented. Because I'm a Sonheim fan, I'm glad to have the CD."
4,Underrated Musical? You Bet!,"I own this album, and the revival cast album as well. They are both fabulous in their own right. Although this version does not have ""Marry Me a Little"" which is a gem sung by Boyd Gaines on the revival, this original cast ""fits"" the style of the show better. They are not supposed to be outstanding vocalists (although they do hold their own.) This show requires each character to be a vocal stylist, and that is accomplished beautifully here. Also, for anyone really paying attention, the lyrics in this original version refer to a ""fag,"" whereas the more PC 90'd lyrics were changed to ""gay."" Hmmm. I'm not sure that was necessary, but apparently someone thought it was."
2,what's the fuss,"I'm an avid fan of musical theatre and a college theatre major and, frankly I do not understand why people are so in love with this musical. I found it to be dated and a chore to listen to. While most performances are good there are a number of actors in this show who have voices that are almost painfull to listen to. They screech and cut through the rest of the voices. Sondheims other work i really enjoy and I found myself disappointed by this muscial that many call ""genius."" what am i missing?"
4,Bring on Company!,"This is really a 4.5Absolutely one of my favorite shows. The lyrics and orchestrations are spectacular. If you are doubting Sondheim's genius, this musical will clear things up. Company is truly a model for musical theater. It has great ballads, wonderful company numbers, and everything in between. The music acts as its own unique characters as well. The opening chords are the dial tones! GENIUS! If you are new or old to musical theater this is a must have. There are MANY recordings, but I only own this one, the original. While this recording isn't the highest quality recording and there are some harmonic issues vocally, I would still say get this recording. It is truly fabulous. There are so many good songs which is my favorite?! Favorite song: ""Sorry-Grateful"""
1,the last battleship,In all the years that I have purchased from Amazon I have never been disappointed till now. I ordered the book as new and was snt a used book for new price. the book was bought for a gentleman who was on the USS Missouri and delivered to his house when He gave me the receipt it said I ordered a used book but paid new price. I am glad that the seller did refund my money but hated to tell the gentleman that I need the book back. My husband says he is going to get the book through someone else. I am very disappointed in what happened.
4,Nice cleanser for combination to oily skin types.,"I like this cleanser and use it every day. It's made for the combination-oily skin types and is nice on the skin. It is one of the only foaming cleansers in the Eminence line that I've tried, and I really like that! Foaming cleansers are often laden with chemicals that you would typically use to clean your floors with, and this isn't! I love, love, love eminence products and this I love as well. The only thing is that it kinda smells like vapor rub, but not quite as strong. I highly recommend it to those with more of an oily skin, as I have. And in the summer it is nice and cooling to the skin. It's very highly concentrated so a little goes a long way. Just put a little on your face with a bit of warm water and you've got foaming action!"
3,Oneida Golden Julliard hostess set,"I was pleased with the expeditiousness of ordering and receiving the above item. It matches the set I already had - with one exception. All my other pieces were made in the USA. This set was identified as having been made in either the USA, Mexico, or Thailand."
5,great cook book,"As a firefighter, this is a terrific traditional old style firehouse recipe cookbook. My father is even shown in the pictorial section of the book doing an exterior attack in 1965. I recommend it heartily, but prefer the cooks at the Presidio Firehouse"
2,"Was it Really the ""Real War""","Not only have I read the book, but I was also one of the Tank Commanders in the book. Not only was the book poorly written, but a total disappointment to myself and to the men of C co. 2-34 Armor. I Do not reccomend this book to anyone."
3,Great subject wasted on a poorly written book!,"A very interesting look at the individuals that fought the war; it's a shame that it was written in such a style that makes it tedious and difficult to follow in an enjoyable manner, (that's why it only gets a 5 from me). In spite of being badly written, the book manages to convey what it must have been like in the Gulf for the servicemen and women who were there, and it does give an insight as to what their mindset was. I wish I could have found it more enjoyable and easy to digest, though."
1,Dont waste your money,This book is hard to read and difficult to understand at times. I should have taken the advice and not read it.
3,Well said,"I read company c several years ago and had a hard time following the flow of the story(non-linear). I was the gunner on Shaffers tank and knew how the story ended but it was still confusing at times. Perhaps from a third party perspective it might be easier to follow,but having first hand experience of the whole thing can make the book very frustrating. Some events are out of sequence and some seem to have been embelished (not outright lies but not entirely accurate). As for Scott Medine I'm apalled that he would attack a fellow soldier,though not completely surprised. Well said Steve."
4,The One That Started it All...,"This is the debut album from Kylie Minogue. Although it barely went gold in the US, it racked up multiplatinum sales in the UK, where it was one of the biggest selling albums of 1988. Minogue dropped her acting gig from the Aussie soap ""Neighbours"" to launch a career with producers Stock Aitken Waterman, and the result is a debut album full of innocent, simple, well-crafted pop. If you're looking for an album of social commentary or deep lyrical content, go somewhere else. ""I Should Be So Lucky"" and ""Got to Be Certain"" are singles that have strong hooks, memorable choruses, and are undeniably catchy. While the rest of the album shines with gems such as ""Turn it to Love,"" and ""It's No Secret,"" Minogue's sole cringeworthy moment is her terrible cover of ""The Locomotion,"" which sounds even cheesier by today's standards. But no matter. This debut album is great for those who want fun, bright dance pop."
1,Poor TV with very poor customer service.,"The tv only worked for a little over two weeks then it went dead. I have been dealing with their customer service for over 2 months with no resolution. They keep promising to send someone to fix it, but they never do!!!! They then promised a new tv, only to go back on their word and say they can order a part that will fix a problem (even though they have never been to my house to see the problem)."
2,Extremely salty - not worth the money,"They are not kidding when they say ""old fashioned movie theater style"". The popcorn has yellow coloring and its extremely salty. A single bag has 750mg of salt. Enough salt to induce high blood pressure in the healthiest of eaters.Instead of this I would reccomend the Newman's Organics, which has the picture of Paul Newman and his wife standing on the cover."
3,"Good product, bad seller","I'm not kidding when I say I opened the outer mailing package and there was a dead flea on the box. Kind of ironic really--but gross.This product is really good and a great help in fighting fleas. It's oral which is easier for my cats. The seller wasn't good. The package was flatten since it wasn't in a good mailer. I mentioned the dead flea already. Also, the ad didn't mention that this was the European version. I mean that's the same active ingredient and all, but I don't know my cats' weight in kilograms! Why the European version and not the domestic one?"
5,Like it! Faster than expected.,This product works great. I have used it before and I refilled though this merchant. It does take a while to take effect if you already have a problem. I prefer an oral medication vs. topical so my cat doesn't lick it or get it on me. She likes it better too because I mix it with a small can of wet food which is a treat for her. I did not want to have to go the vet for another prescription so I order here. It comes from UK so it take a while but I received it way before the expected date of arrival. I almost canceled the order when it told me it would take 6-8 weeks for delivery but it didn't take half that long. I am glad I waited. I saved money on the actual cost and the cost of a vet appointment. I will come back here when I need more.
4,good product,"I hid the flavor of this liquid flea product in canned cat food and one of my cats gobbled it up. Another more fussy cat wouldn't touch it. However, the white fluffy cat who has terrible flea problems is the one who liked it. The product worked very well for about 2 1/2 weeks which is about 1/2 week longer than the topical products last for her. The fleas love white and she is constantly plagued by fleas. It would probably last a whole month on any other cat. Overall, I liked the product and it was much less messy than the topical products."
4,Good product,"This is a good product for my two cats that will injest it with tuna juice. I have a third cat that will not eat this mixed with anything and I give her the program pill. Unless your environment is mostly flea free, you will need to use another product in conjuction to kill the adult fleas. I use an occasional capstar pill for that and it seems to work for me."
1,Didn't last even a week!,"I have used the pill by this brand but this was an oral liquid that in my opinion was totally ineffective and I did use it in combination with the capstar pill. I Will never buy the oral liquid again, big waste of alot of money!"
1,Too much,"I was instructed to read this by a medical professional. I read it got a few things out of it but there is some medication that you are to take along with the diet and I do not feel that I should have to dole out more money for ""stuff""."
2,"Flimsy, cheap, and definitely not what was pictured","I have $10 costumes that came from Walmart that are much better quality. The material is thin. I am afraid to wash it for fear it will fall apart. If it wasnt for the fact that we leave for Walt Disney World in a few days and my daughter intends to wear it to the pirate and princess party, I would return it. The costume looks vaguely like the picture but nowhere near as tailored and nice."
2,Careful when ordering,This item's size runs small. I wish they would warn you about sizes running small. Seller is not being very cooperative in the returning process.
2,Poor quality for the price,"Although the costume is stylish, more so than most pirate costumes, it is of very poor quality. The seams ripped and the buttons fell off after being worn twice. Also, the shirt is a half shirt and only covers the chest."
1,Poor quality,"I ordered this costume for my daughter for her lead role in the school play and thought it would be outstanding for her part. The item was nothing like what was pictured on the package. The materials were very thin and flimsy and weren't the color pictured. It looked like the fabric pieces were cut and attached carelessly. The belt was the same way. The boot covers didn't cover the pants properly. The hat looked like it was made from construction paper. Also, when we opened the item, it looked like it was used and sent back by another customer. The seller shipped the item quickly and offered the item at a better price than others. I was pleased with that. However, the item was very disappointing, especially for being a Disney costume. I expected much better from Disney. I'm not rating the seller here, just the item. When the return is complete, I will give accurate feedback for the seller."
2,Just not worth the money....,"I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers on this product, but my 8 year old really wanted this costume. The costume is SO cheap, thin, and poorly made. It does not look like the photo, but sloppy and cheap when we tried it on. Not to mention the hat. It arrives flat, and you have to bend it into shape. We were able to bend it into a correct shape, but it just did not look good. For the price, it should not look this cheap! We sent it right back. Thankfully this was a prime purchase, so we have an easy return!"
3,Pirates of the Caribbean 3 Elizabeth Pirate Deluxe Child (2007) Child Halloween Costume (Large (10-12)),"The costume arrived with lots of time to spare before Halloween! For the price, it came with lots of costume pieces and the overall look was good. The only downside was the hat, which although meant to be ""weathered"", was impossible to re-mold into something useable due to shipping/packing. Ended up buying a different hat from the local Halloween store.Otherwise, my daughter loved her costume and the quality was there. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and the shipping time was great!"
2,Cheaply made,Quality of product is very poor for the price. Boot covers do not fit over shoes at all. Would have never bought product had i seen it in person.
5,esta si es musica!!!!,"I have mostly all of the tambora Antonio albums and I have to say, they're all awesome! this one is a classic, with great exitos like Lamberto Quintero (who remembers the movie?), albur de amor, Las Gaviotas and valentin de la sierra. I remember buying a copy of it down in tijuana a few years ago, pero, I lost that one =( and to pay 19.99 for it? I was lucky enough to find this one at my local swapmeet for 10 bucks. Mejor download it for a cheaper price, or try to see if you can find it at your local cd stores. This is a must have in your colecction!!!"
1,The monopoly begins again,"Bless the Philharmonic, but who decided NOT to make this available on regular DVD (regions 0 or 1)? The monopoly is the group of manufacturers who made Blu-ray the new quad 8-track. And what if someone DOESN'T own a TV, let alone HD? I watch on my PC. Curses, Red Baron - and may you fail with this venture, too."
1,NO DATA on DVDs,Two DVDs ( One original + ne replacement ) of this event received with NO DATA on them !.No DVD Quality Control applied to this product prior to sending these DVDs to Customer
2,"Interesting, but not the best.","There are some good quotes in this book, but there are more that are not. The ""Best things anybody ever said,"" should be changed to ""Interesting Quotes.""Example:~Quote~""What luck for rulers that men do not think."" A. HitlerI don't see how the above quote from his book is considered ""Best things anybody ever said.""He even has some of his own quotes in the book. The book is funny in some ways and serious in other ways. Also, the pages are not numbered."
5,Inspiring movie based on a true story about an autistic marathoner,An inspiring and heart warming movie about a boy with autism who sets a record in a marathon. Great cast and great acting by the supporting actors and actresses. It also highlights the challenges of living with autism and the sacrifices family members must make.
4,nice little kit,"It's not quite what I needed but it is a good kit, will come in handy for many things! thanks"
1,Retractable USB Synch & Charge - Absolutely Frustrating,"I purchased a Retractable USB Synch & Charge as a ""stocking stuffer"" for Christmas for my wife to use with her Motorola Razr Cell Phone as a charger from her PC's USB and as a car charger -- sounded like a great idea, but didn't match with reality. Upon connecting the phone to the USB via the Emerge Technologies Inc (Irving, Texas) product, the PC went on a wild goose chase for software and never can back so the charger didn't work; I then tried the car charger adapter and got an error message from the cell phone: unable to charge. I've never gotten a return call from customer service, and the documentation on their webswite is woefully lacking. I would not buy any product from this company again and only hope I can get my money back!!! What a waste of time!!!"
1,DO NOT buy this.,"I bought this item today so I could avoid adding a new slot to my old P.C. However, when I hooked this up from my computer to my Wireless G router, the router started smoking and making crackling noises. I wouldn't recommend this product at all."
4,Marinate on It,"I remember the Onion AV club's review of this album mentioning something about how the songs require double digit listens to sink in. Not only is this true, but I'm finding that the album reveals itself over double digit months. I got the album when it came out, nearly three years ago, and tried to love it but couldn't quite figure it out.""Will My Lord Be Gardening"" and ""Catherine (Let A Positive Stream...)"" were immediate favorites, but while much of the rest of the album intrigued me, I wasn't sold. Now, the songs are all familiar to me, as they've entered my random iTunes queue over the past few years. On occasion, I listen to the album all the way through, and each time is more rewarding than the last.Now, after a considerable time living with Precollection, I've come to love it. Not merely out of familiarity, but because it's great. Truly great (except for Melusina).""Something something something something something isn't there."""
2,kinda/sorta,"This latest one by the Lilys has definitely left me wondering if I should/would ""impulse-buy"" any future release. Seeing as past albums & ep's range from My Bloody Valentine to the Creation/Kinks to Kraftwerk, I should've guessed that it would be a different experience compared to previous exploits. But this one seems a bit like an album that was recorded because it had to be (like a contract filler or something). The songs aren't as dynamic as past compositions and the mixes seem a bit underproduced. I'm all for underproduction; if you're talking four-track + one mic catching a good performance. This left me feeling like I needed to get the older albums out and not dwell on the money I'd just spent. This one should be titled ""History of Amazing Let-downs."""
2,mad,"heasley's gone mad again. genre-hopping from ripping off MBV early on (a good thing, actually) to ostentatious chord changes in SPADES in ""the 3-way"" era to this mess of melodyless melodies (ok, there's one"" ""will my lord be gardening."") much much better pop was released this year by such groups as BLACK WATCH, GUIDED BY VOICES, ROBYN HITCHCOCK."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I usually do not write reviews but feel compelled to warn people NOT to buy this album if you are expecting something even remotely similar to the Lily's last album Three Way. This album is nothing like it and I found it not even remotely enjoyable to listen to. It has none of the blissful pop magic of the last album. Instead it is much more dark and brooding with frequent annoying shifts in register that made it almost impossible for me to listen to. I barely made it through the CD once and will not listen to it again. My advice if you are curious about this album is to wait a month or two and then buy it used, as I am absolutely positive that a lot of people who bought it based on the Lily's last album will be dumping this one pretty quickly."
3,Movie Fan - Fan,Movie Fan - Fan is almost totally correct. It is not as good as the first one. Anthony Edwards is terrible. He should never had tried this roll. He did not carry it at all.
5,In Cold Blood - 1997 remake,"I loved close to Holcomb, Kansas when the Clutter family was murdered. This video and the original are a must have for me. The remake is much longer than the original movie. I enjoy both videos. I also recommend two other movies -- Capote and Infamous. Both are Truman Capote's association with the murders and the writing of his book. I recommend all four movies to those intrigued by a murder in a small town many years ago."
4,Doctor Rockit - The Music Of Sound,"Doctor Rockit, Matthew Herbert's downtempo alter ego, brings his first album, The Music of Sound on the sadly defunct Clear label (Herbert, however, has grievances with the label -- but that's a different story). The album skips willy-nilly across the globe, stopping by the Middle East for ""Café Beograd"" to ""Hong Kong."" There are moments of absolute beauty, such as ""Song Without Words,"" and moments that are funkily askew, like ""Music Box."" He also seems to be wrestling with his other guises: ""Babykiss"" and ""Theeeee Ennnnnd"" aren't far removed from his work as Wishmountain. But ""Male James Bonding"" is pure Doctor Rockit, with its nimble spy funk, while ""A Quiet Week in the House"" is a subdued house track. Although the album as a whole is uneven, it's still worthy every penny."
2,A Strange Variation of the Isshinryu System,"On the good parts:An overall interesting read.Everything else:Okay, this book is rather divergent from any branch of Isshinryu with which I have dealt. In it, Mr. Rosenbaum propagates much of the false information of Isshinryu, such as the patch ""Megami"" (meaning simply ""goddess"") being named ""Mizugami"" (which means water goddess, or goddess of a specific body of water), Shimabuku's uncle refusing martial instruction (he instructed him in both martial arts and fortune telling), the Japanese helping Tatsuo avoid conscription in exchange for karate lessons, and several other misinformed ideas.As for the technical information presented, it is not particularly in-depth.In closing, pick another book."
3,A good attempt at explaining a complex system,"I'm all for any book on my style of Karate, but there really isn't much in this book that isn't found in other isshinryu books. Not only that but there are some errors that give away the fact that one the author's reference were obviously older isshinryu books that are know to have said errors. Also there are no techniques in this book, its purpose is more aimed at just giving the history of Isshinryu. However with errors, like the founder's birthday being the wrong day and year, it could use a little bit more work."
2,This book wasa big disappointment.,This is a well-written but poorly-argued effort to concoct a conspiracy theory about certain events in the Civil War. It is uses few primary sources and not well. It seems a clumsy combination of Jones' book Eight Hours Before Richmond and Tidwell's April '65 with very little that is new. Far too many errors of fact make it a poor account of either the Kilpatrick Raid or the Confederate spy service. It wasted my time and money.

2,Disappointing,"Very confusing entry in an otherwise stellar series. The 4 books before this one were of a very consistent quality, but I could never get into this one. New characters kept popping up with each page turn, but there was never any commitment by the author to any of them. They were all shadowy, shrugged off. The plot was just plain silly. I will say this: the claustrophobic atmosphere of the plague certainly penetrates every page. I suppose that's an achievement. Ultimately, I just didn't care about the people, the crimes or the punishment."
2,Not enough info,"I was hoping to see a lot of info in here - but instead, there's a few good tutorials and that's it. The coverage of the program is seriously lacking. There many areas of LightWave I wish the authors covered. I think the few tutorials included are good, the book isn't really the best for really learning Lightwave. There's no information on expressions and very little modeling coverage."
3,6.5 & 7 ???,"Yes it IS a weird way to title a book. I didn't purchase this book. I picked it up in a bookstore and read through it. It seemed no different from any of the other Lightwave books that have come before it. There was no new impressive ways of doing things. There was a lot of work with tools that have been in the program since versions 3-5.6. I understand that they DO need to go over the basics, but to tell people that it is lightwave 6.5 & 7 applied? They should have focused more on the new tools for everyone to learn such as new light options, new voxel effects, the spreadsheet and motion mixer."
4,A must for new and experienced Lightwave users!,"Great book that is simple to use, yet powerful in it's delivery. Many useful techniques and very well written. The only reason for not giving it a perfect score was that there were a couple of typographical errors. Being an experienced Lightwave user, I was able to figure it out, but new users might get confused. If you have any questions, the authors are available to help. Something I wished more authors would do to help out their readers if something needs a bit more explaining. Lightwave 7 is a very powerful animation program and this book helps in providing the user with a better understanding of some of the more complex tools."
3,Just an average dictionary,"I wouldn't say it's a bad dictionary, but there's nothing that stands out about this one. I have the American Heritage Dictionary, 4th Edition paperback version. Comparing these two, they both failed about the same number of time when looking up words; this one just slightly better since it is thicker. I strongly recommend Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary 2nd Edition over any other desktop dictionaries. Since Amazon has excellent return policy on books, if you don't believe my words, simply get this one and Cambridge one and see which one you like better."
5,A well-worn (and tape-fortified) mainstay always at my hand,"This is my ""resolution"" to the need for the large hard-cover versions of my favorite dictionaries. It gets to sleep in the drawer at night, but mainly it lives on top of the desk - always at hand; often consulted. I won't claim never to make errors, but I do try to avoid them. The Oxford Dictionary of Current English is how I do it."
4,One of the best of the paperbacks,"I use dictionaries every day in my high school courses, and this is one that I often recommend to my students. The Oxford Dictionary of Current English is one of the best, and I've seen many of them. Its name gives you an idea of its usefulness. There are many current terms that you will not find in other dictionaries, especially pocket paperbacks. I highly recommend it, especially for high school classes!"
1,Mostly Useless beyond 8th grade,"I am so sorry I bought this dictionary. It may be that I expect too much of a small volume, but it's been less than useless to me because I've mostly used it to waste time looking for words it does not contain."
2,Not good on the Kindle,This book does not look good on the Kindle or IPad. The content is good but the publisher did not do a good job translating it to the electronic format. Almost like they never looked at their product---or didn't care. It is very hard to read with the font they use.
1,Broken in the Box,Came broken in the box. Number 7/8 engine was broke off laying in the packing. Rockets under port wing bend at a 45 degree angle to the point if you try to bend them back they will break off. First time ordering from this vendor and more than disappointed.
3,Needs Better Packaging,"The retail packaging this model comes in is NOT suitable for shipping. Mine came with engines, pods and horiz stabs broken off. Fortunately, they were fairly easy to glue back on, but it could have been much worse. The package does not protect the model at all. Once fixed, the model is sturdy, has good detail, and the detail is accurate for the time period (in this case Vietnam era)."
4,Steve Bug - Volksworld,"_Volksworld_ shows off what Steve Bug can really do. From the sweet chords in ""Rhodes Flash"" to the light, sunny vibe of ""I Like It,"" Bug demonstrates that he can go beyond mere thumping (though there's certainly nothing wrong with the thumping of ""Original Polystar"" or ""Extrem Expedit""). The smooth house of ""Deep Blue,"" ""This is No Chanson,"" and ""Drives Me Up the Wall"" slides right into your shoes, while ""Kurze Pause"" and ""Big Cheese from Wisconsin"" go for some slow electro-funk. Fittingly, ""The End"" closes the album on a mellow trip, all chords and bass. It's a ride that doesn't get old."
4,That's Really Funny - It's True!,This is a very funny book containing quotes from the foremost comedians of our time.
3,don't be a euro-elitist!,"it never fails. somebody from europe finds something american that they like and they have to come to the conclusion that, if it's so good, it must have a heavy connection to the uk. these folks really don't know diddley about what's going on in the states. what a bunch of self-congratulatory snots. jeff mills is very detroit - sorry, not very london.and being from detroit actually means energetic, yes, but also samey and unitextured and dated, so i don't really agree that this smokes the competition."
4,don't be so regional!,"it's true that detroit djs invented this flavor of techno. but the soul of techno music has always been in london, england.all the waveforms recordings betray mills' love affair with europe. for those of us privileged to hear the master during his long residency at the voyager club, london, this record brings back memories of long hot summers full of raves and festivals.government legislation has destroyed the soul of the dance scene in the uk and the us. corporate infiltration has buried the body. but this music stands as a worthy tombstone."
2,I hope this isnt his best,"What a bad first impression of Jeff Mills. I hope the King of Techno is better than this. My biggest complaint is this ISNT MIXED! Big 5 second breaks between songs. So no DJing here, just Jeff Mills composing techno. I thought the dance music standard was to mix your CD and release the vynls with seperations for Dj's. If your CD has track marks your asking for every cheeze ball CD-spinng DJ to play your songs. If you can forgive Jeff for this and just try to listen to his compositions, they are still terribly weak and repetitive. Some of the songs sound decent, hence the 2 stars. Maybe they would be better if they were DJ mixed but not much. If you listen to this on a regular basis, you are definitely from Detriot."
3,Dying to know,A superficial look at alternatives for the dispoal of human remains. Entertaining and possibly helpful if you're in the market for such services.
2,1937 recording quality,be warned this CD was made from records recorded in 1937 and the quality is far below a modern CD (or even 1950's LPs). It may be artistically significant (I can't judge) but you probably don't want it for your only version of this music.
1,Poorest quality CD on the market.,"Recording quality on this CD was the worst in my entire collection. All tracks have persistent (and loud) hiss. Dynamic range of an old 78 rpm recording. If I still had my receipt, this one would be going back."
1,Read any Veryan book except those in the Riddle series,"Another reader mentioned several anachronisms that jar the reader out of the suspension of disbelief. One of the worst was the heroine referring to a garment ""two sizes too small."" Standard clothing sizes in 1749? Yeah, right. Does anyone really think that the gifted, intelligent writer who brought us quality work in the Sanguinet series and the Golden Chronicles could possibly have written this book? It reads like a poor imitation of Veryan. The humor here seems forced, the romance contrived, and the main characters just not very interesting. And it hurts my feelings to say these things in regard to an author whose work I have treasured for years. The quality of the work began eroding -- IMHO -- with the first of the Riddle series (although the first two books were ok; not great but ok) and has declined with each successive book. It's very disheartening."
1,Is that you Patricia?,"This book is certainly not up to Patricia Veryan's standards. As an avid reader of her books, I was quite disappointed. Usually, the name Patricia Veryan on the cover is a guarantee of a wonderful read. Not so in this book. The plot is muddled and implausible. Our heroine, Elspeth, is dimwitted and silly. She gives us absolutely no reason to like her. Our hero, Gervaise, is rude and unkind. It is unclear why these two fall for each other. However, they deserve each other! Steer clear of this book."
3,Cute design,"The Drummer Boy sock kit is a very cute design. It has nice colors and except for a couple places, good instructions. My biggest objection to this product is the quality of some of the felt. I have done these kits for many, many years but haven't done one for about 8 years. The quality or thickness of the felt has diminished greatly, which at times makes the sewing difficult and harder to make look perfect. I wish I had gone and bought my own piece of gray felt and replaced the one in the kit. I made the sock for my future son-in-law and my daughter was thrilled with it and thought it was great."
2,what happened?,"this cd is a major letdown especially in contrast to their excellent album, a place in the sun. the songs on atomic are boring and redundant and simply do not display the talent that they showed on their previous effort. it may grow on me will more listening, but i dont foresee that. its a good thing i only paid $5.88 for it!"
5,A fantastic value!,"While shopping in my local record store I noticed this Lit CD. These days new CD's at that price is a rare thing, I couldn't resist picking it up. This CD is a great mix of fast paced melodic tunes that all have something that grabs you. The lyrical comment is all very entertaining and relevant. It's not often you find at CD that has more than three good songs on it, this has at least eight."
2,Where's the Energy...? Maybe they should be called Lit(e),"To the guys in Lit, what happened? All the energy from the last two CD's is gone. A bunch of mellow wimpy tunes with some of the dumbest cheesy lyrics I've heard in a long time. It just sounds like the boys didn't have many good ideas this time around. I love good melodies that are interesting but this album is so predictable and juvenile. Buy either ""Tripping the Light Fantastic"" or ""A Place in the Sun"" before this. I love bands like All, Descendents, Strung Out etc. but this album pails in comparison. Next time, they need to rock out more. This is lame."
4,Atomic vs A Place In The Sun,"Following up their last CD, A Place in the Sun is a very hard task. It created a base for fan friendly music. I enjoyed their last CD greatly. In their latest CD, Atomic they have some great songs in, ""Lipstick and Bruises"", ""The Last Time Again"", ""She Comes"", and they threw in ""Over My Head"" which is a bonus. Atomic also has some mellow and lighter songs in, ""Happy In The Meantime"", ""Sunny Weather"", and ""Live For This"". Lit has done a good job with keeping their sound similair to A Place in the Sun. So, if you like lit you should be happy with Atomic."
5,Atomic will blow you away,"This cd is a incredible mix of songs.From Lipstick and Bruises to Addicted it is sure to be a crowd pleaser.These guys are so multi-talented ,and in this day and age ,it is so rare to find a group that really stands out..With all the BSB and Britney wannabe's it is nice to find something that has a nice beat but with a edge..I would deffinately recommend this cd to anyone that wants a feel good /ride in ya car/hang with ya friends sorta cd...plus the Limited Edition cd has a extra cd with a awesome video on it.. How could you go wrong? there's no way that I see...so BUY THIS CD!"
3,Good ol' rock,"Lit's newest album, had a large reputation to follow up on. After the success of A Place In The Sun, it was impossible to hope that any other Lit album would be as good. True, this is a good album, but nothing extraordinary. It sounds just like all the other alternative pop bands there are out, Eve6 for instance. There are no brand new musical arrangements, and the same chords over and over again get quite repetative. The same back up vocals over and over again get repetative.This album has many setbacks, but many niceties as well. The band's style is very energetic, and the lyrics are quite creative. While, again, nothing is out of the ordinary, the album does manage to stand on its own."
3,Not as good as I expected it to be,I give this CD a 3 star because some of the songs were o.k like Happy In the Meantime and She comes. However the songs aren't very catchy. If you haven't got a Lit cd yet I recommend their other cd-A place in the sun.
4,Takes place of A Place In the Sun,"This third album by the band Lit follows similar lines of their second album A Place in the Sun. The guitar on some of the songs resembles the more hardcore musical stylings of Tripping the Light Fantastic, but keeps that So. Cal. feeling. While some of the songs sound more like pop, there is still a feeling of the boys from Orange County. Atomic is a good album and is a great addition the any fan of Lit."

5,Atomic review,"This album is a really good album that I think everyone should be listening to right now. If you do not have this album then you should get it. This album is packed with great songs such as Something to Someone, Addicted, Happy in the Meantime and Over my Head. It's just a great album. Need I say more. It's definately a must have if you are a Rocker or a Rocker at heart."
2,Two Stars for Two Good Songs,"There are only two good songs on this album: Something to Someone and Everything's Cool. After hearing My Own Worst Enemy on the radio dozens of times I decided to give the band a try. The store I went to didn't have the CD with that song on it, but this one was only $5.88 so I bought it. What a dissapointment. You can tell the band didn't even put much effort into this album because there isn't even a booklet to go with it, there's just a paper with the tracklisting on it. I will admit that all the songs are catchy but they're also entirely shallow and generic. This CD was a big dissapointment."
3,There are problems with the sound,"I read another customer review which mentioned the poor sound quality, and I agree. Before reading that review, I figured I was being too critical. However, I have the same recording on LP and it sounds better.This is very unexpected coming from Sony/Columbia, as they have been re-issuing a string of outstanding remastered classical discs which have incredibly good sound, many of them from the same era as this recording.I was disappointed with the sound here, and wonder why it isn't up to their usual standards. The performances are still the best, though, and the booklet has very good information."
4,Broadway Classic Sounds Great in Remastered Edition,"One of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best musicals is given a credible representation on this album, which showcases the original Broadway stars Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza. Martin is lovely as Nellie Forbush, and Pinza aquits himself well as De Beque. William Tabbert is one of the best recorded Cables, and Juanita Hall shows us what was missed by having her dubbed in the film. Although the tempos seem a little slow here and there, this recording is a polished classic that belongs in any decent musical theatre collection - of particular interest are the bonus tracks, including the cut songs ""Loneliness of Evening"" and ""My Girl Back Home""."
5,Just as it should sound!,"THis is right in every respect and added a little brightness to Broadway. It's a comical lightness to a love story that is, in my opinion, the best musical ever made. Bali Ha'i is especially catchy and you will for sure find yourself singing to yourself when you're a little unhappy. I recommend it very highly."
5,BRILLIANT!,"UNFORGETTABLE! Once heard - totally hooked! Another one of those guilty pleasures - and well-deserved!The album is perfect - a superb transfer from the originals to this medium. The Great EZIO PINZA still seduces with his unstoppable charm and magnificent voice - ditto Mary Martin as the 'innocent' abroad during those troubled times. [Nothing quite surpassed this original cast]. AND fortunately, not all of this is 'sugar and spice' after all - the musical {and subsequent movie version} was banned in various 'conservative' countries - [and still is cut and butchered abroad.]Visit this recording often."
3,Wha-?,"Although I love the message behind the story, I must admit that the soundtrack left me a bit...cold. Mary Martin must have been one of those ""you had to be there"" actresses- because her voice seemed flat and lifeless to me. I am sure I will get a lot of flack about this comment, Mary Martin was my mother's favorite actress, topped only by Ethel Merman and any kind of review less than stellar will irk many."
3,1949 on CD does not work,"Yes, it is great to have one of the greatest musical theater pieces preserved on CD with the original cast, but it is painful to listen to the lackluster quality of the recording. It would be better to listen to the original 78rpm recording. There is a wonderful 1967 Lincoln Center recording in the Columbia vaults with Florence Henderson and Georgio Tozzi. It is beautifully produced and performed. Lets go Sony Classical! We need to have this on cd now!"
3,Not Enough,The story line is fine building up to the Hubble but not enough photos from the Hubble of fantastic space beauty!
2,very disappointed,I thought it would be full of photos taken from the Hubble......views of nebula. NOT. Seeing IMAX I thought it was going to be 3D or high def. My fault for not looking more closely.
3,Not images from Hubble,I expectes images Tork from space but in fact this is a documentary about how it was fixed on space.
1,The worst 3D DVD I own,If you are looking for great 3D effects you won't find it here! Most of the video is on the ground or in the spacecraft. Very disappointed!
5,Everyone needs to see this!,"I saw this Movie on the big 3D Imax theater in McMinnville Oregon after checking out the ""Spruce Goose"" flying boat. This DVD just can't compare with that, however at least it has the basic pictures of what I saw there and I can watch it over and over. God's creation is truly amazing."
2,HUGE POTENTIAL BUT DISAPPOINTING,"I am a huge fan of NASA and highly respect the brave astronaut community. I visited Cape Canaveral a few years ago and was mesmerized. That said, this film is a disappointment. FIRST - WHAT IT IS NOT: It is NOT a film about the fantastic images shot through the Hubble telescope. Yes, about 1/4 of the film is that, but it is far too short. MOST OF IT IS about the astronauts, suiting up, launching and then repairing the telescope. We were disappointed. This was a grand opportunity to present the awe and wonder of space through visualizing the images brought back from the Hubble itself. Instead we were given images of astronauts unscrewing bolts in space and discussing the lack of toilet facilities while on EVAs. Again, hats off to the courage of the astronauts. However, PLEASE PRODUCE A FILM WITH THE MAJORITY OF FOOTAGE COMING FROM THE HUBBLE ITSELF. The magesty of God's universe is a show of a lifetime in itself."
5,Great educational DVD,"We bought a few 3D movies, and found the Imax DVD's the best. The kids never leave when we put on these movies, and the ooo's and ahhh's are classic. They are worth every penny and the educational value is priceless."
5,this is about the hubble telescope not it's findings!,This is a great awe inspiring show about how nasa saved the Hubble Space telescope. It's not about the findings or the things it shot in space very much. It's impressive and beautiful. The picture is perfect on blu ray 3d and the narration is excellent by LEonardo D c. It has webisodes for extras and you get a good sense of how hard it was to save the telescope. It does wet my appetite for more footage of the actual deep space findings of the telescope though. If you KNOW what this is then you Wont be disapointed.
1,Good to watch if you want to fall asleep,"This was just awful. The 3d effects are few and far between. The content is boring, its only about the building and maintenance of the telescope...not actually images of what the scope sees."
1,ANOTHER WARNER BROS TRANSFER TRAVESTY,"Dont know whats wrong with Warner Bros recent DVD releases. The transfers are unsuitable for display on large screens, exhibiting macro-blocking and pixelation. This one will be relegated to the shelf along with: Sherlock Holmes, Inception, and Legend of the Guardians. Yes, it took 4 purchases to see the pattern."
1,it sucked,I have seen quite a few 3D DVD's but this one really sucked. I can't see what the point was but only to make money. They should be ashamed.
4,very interesting,"Vídeo de ótima qualidade, com imagens sensacionais, recomendável para um programa interessante com a família, despertando interesse por conhecimento.Imagens belíssimas."
2,regret,"i was expecting something way better than this. it was not as bad as ""the grand canyon, river at risk"" but it wasn't much better either.all in all, i'm not going to buy any more of these ""educational"" 3d blu rays. they've pretty much all been disappointing. i'm only going to buy actual 3d movies."
2,Ho hum,I thought it was going to be great... 3D images from the Hubble. Well if I psych myself enough they might seem to be 3D in some suggestive or fleeting manner. Good information about the scope but ho hum images that I can get for free from nasa.gov.
5,Hubble 3D,Very good 3d Film. Makes you appreciate this place we call home. Did it make itself ?? I don't think so.
5,Amazing!,The producers of this film did an AMAZING job. I believe this is the kind of thing that Imax was made for! I originally had seen this at the Reuben H. Fleet Science center in San Diego a year ago and went looking for it in there store recently. They wanted $40 for it!! Started looking on Amazon and discovered Prime instant videos and got it for $15!! I love this film and would recommend it to anyone who likes seeing great high quality shots of space and learning about how small we really are on this place called Earth. Very well done.
2,Not enough space footage,"If you are looking for the many amazing images that Hubble has captured of the universe, this is not for you. I was hoping for gasp after gasp floating through space listening to scientific speculation about Hubble's findings. And you get about 10 minutes of that. The majority of the picture is about astronauts fixing a few bolts and panels in space.I am sure there are those out there for whom that is fascinating. Please enjoy.If you are looking for Hubble's magnificent images go to the NASA page or do a Google search. You will have more luck than in this video."
1,Big Let down!,"I wanted to love this video. The stunning clarity of the visuals are incredible. The shots taken from the Hubble are completely mind blowing. But, please, 3/4 of the film is about the astronauts and their telescope repair. Ok - 1/4 could have been about that, but where were the additional extraordinary images from the Hubble - isn't that what we are paying to see? Big, big mistake! Could have been a phenomenal DVD, instead of OK"
1,Save the money!,"Several minutes of commercials and trailers for completely un-related videos into the program, you finally get the rest of the thing which is merely bragging about how they went about making the video, with frequent references to the personnel on the three missions to the HST, most of these lifted directly, or shared with, the footage from the NASA website and/or NASA TV. There are precious few shots of a VERY few of the discoveries of the HST over the years. A few of these are animated to abstraction, closing in or moving away from the objects that are subjects of the current view. I'll save the jewel case and toss the rest of it. I'd be too embarrassed to sell it to anyone, even used, and I surely wouldn't wish to build up anybody else's hopes and have them crash as mine did. The Hubble Space Telescope was a brilliant and quite valuable project; this video is not!Save the money, or use it on something worthwhile. Like a box seat to watch paint dry."
3,Has that WOW factor that only 3D can give you,"Grossly over-priced for this 40+ minute movie, but enjoyable, although maybe a little boring. I questioned the native 3D camera, let alone an IMAX camera, in such a tight and small space, but the effects were pretty cool however they achieved them.The best part for me were the titles, which would burst into stars that appeared to float all around the room.There are a couple of special feature clips, in 2D, but haven't checked them out yet.Nice watch, but wish I hadn't actually purchased it."
2,Don't get the 3-D version.,After about 10 min. of watching the 3-D version we were all starting to get headaches.So we switched over to 2-D. The 2-D version is not in high-definition.2-D in standard definition is still better than the torture of 3-D.
4,Informative,Great picture quality. Very informative. Would recommend to anyone who really wants to know the facts. Love the 3D. My favorite subjects are Science and Math.
5,Great Job,I bought Program Green for cats 11-20 pounds 6 month supply through Amazon. The product was shipped right away and received right away. I am very happy with the purchase and this vendor.
5,cat's like it,"We've tried pills and the liquid you put on the back of the neck. Both are too hard to do as our cats dont allow us to easily apply ointment or give pills. Bottom line, our cats dont mind eating this stuff! We mix it in with the wet cat food ( meow mix) and they eat it right up, no problems. This product also seems to work as far as the fleas being kept away. We don't have fleas. So, its easy to give them and it seems to work. What more could you want? No more nightmare everytime flea medicine time comes around is a ggod thing :)"
1,poor description,"The description said ""oral suspension"" which I took to mean in pill form. It turns out to be a liquid that has to mixed into a cat's canned food. Very messy and the cat didn't want to eat it."
5,Photography book,"The Book of Photography: The History, the Technique, the Art, the FutureThis book is excellent, It has the history of Photography and many pictures from famous Photographers. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants information on Photography."
3,The Story of Serra and his Missions.,"""The Royal Road"" is a book about the life and career of Fr. Junipero Sierra, written with teenagers in mind. The subject is the inspiring story of the founding and the early days of the Missions of California.The writing is almost like a novel and, with some of the details included, probably could be considered an historical novel. While not as instructive as the adult reader might like, it does give the reader a sense of the dreams, successes and trials of early California. While focusing on Serra, it also gives a reasonably good history of the Missions as a group, but not individually.I read this book in anticipation of a visit to two of Serra's missions. I am glad that I did. I have read other books about him and his work, but this highlighted aspects of the story which I did not pick up in other volumes."
4,Fascinating but challenging,"The premise of the book is that the esp experiments of the Theosophists who examined chemical elements can be closely matched to the late 20th century quark model of atomic structure.The book contains quantum dynamic equations, which require an understanding of the mathematics of the subject. It is not written in the form of a 'popularising' book, and can be challenging for the casual reader. However as it claims to offer a view into areas of physics not yet being explored by experimentalists, it offers the intriguing possibility of showing how our understanding of atomic structure may look in 30 or 40 years."
2,Somewhat Interesting But Not Very Practical,"There are about five pages worth of useful info in this book. The rest is a bunch of history that may or may not be interesting to you. ""Citrus"" by Walheim was more on target for my purpose of selecting, planting and caring for an eight tree home grove."
5,the Perfect Vase,I bought it as a gift and had the florist add a floral arrangement before I presented it. It was a big hit.
4,Great head!,"I love the head. Very warm and ""organic"" sound. Made my djembe sound better than before. Although my djembe is another brand, I found the head a little difficult to fit. Maybe it's my djembe or it's the head. But nevertheless, I was able to work around it. If not for this, I would give this a 5-star rating."
5,excellent,"I am a native Texan and did not mind the country talk. James Hime is from Houston, and he did well with his characters, setting, and plot."
1,A Mistake,"I picked this book up at the library by mistake, then I compounded my mistake by actually going ahead and reading it - all of it. While I thought the plot had promise and showed some imagination, I was more than just a little put off by the contrived ending, the stereotypical, unimaginative - often sophmoric dialog, and the complete lack of any sympathetic characters with the possible exception of a black lab who gets blown up at the end in a failed Rin Tin Tin attempt to rescue one of the story's heroines. If the author was going to steal his ideas for characters from Tony Hillerman (a legendary retired Texas Ranger instead of a legendary retired Navajo police captain, a black sheriff's deputy instead of an indian police sargeant, etc.), it would have served him better if he had also learned something from Hillerman's genius for recreating authentic speech patterns and plausible, imaginative and frequently witty repartee."
4,Strong Beginnings,"This is a very good story of a small Texas town and the very human people that inhabit it. The solution to the mystery is not a huge surprise, but our hero's handling of it bodes well for the future of this character. Let's hope the author can sustain the momentum."
4,daughters of the house,"I enjoyed this book immensly. i was confused as to when it took place, but besides that it was a great book which i read in only a couple days. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for an interesting book with a little different taste to it."
4,gripping story,"After having read Stephen Ambrose's book The Citizen Soldiers, I wanted to read more about the Battle of the Bulge, and especially about Bastogne. This was the only book I could find in our local library so I took it out. The book is not a dry military history, but rather, like Ambrose's book, it tells the stories of the people who were there, in the middle of the battles. It gives the reader a good idea of the importance of the town and the lengths to which the units and the individuals went to prevent the Germans from taking the town. Of course, the history is helpful, too! I often find myself wanting to buy a book immediately after I've read it in a library copy but, if I hold off long enough, find that I don't need the book after all. It's been some months now since I read this one, and I STILL want to own it. Hope it becomes available again!"
3,Not what I expected,"For the price I guess it was a good buy but I would not buy another one. It feel and looks very cheap, It's really flimsy and does not zip up. In my opinion is does not look very professional."
4,Logical & not boring- helps organize writing and thinking,"The text suggests many excellent patterns to organize technical writing: how to describe processes and mechanisms, how to organize a classification, an interpretation, a recommendation, a proposal, a research effort. My writing gets noticed for its quality and professionalism. The book makes me think more clearly and helps me organize my thoughts on paper - an unexpected result."
3,Nice to look at,Once its all put together it looks good and you feel it was worth it after the difficulty of putting it together.Pretty simple as models go and the instructions are easy to follow despite being in japanese. I would suggest having a model kit beforehand and some of the pieces are quite small.Not very durable however you'll have to find somewhere to admire it from afar.
5,Give Credit Where Credit is Due,"I read this book with the explicit purpose of exposing the flaws that I expected to find for an article I was writing about racial myths. Instead, I found myself convinced by the statistics and arguments, notwithstanding intensive and prolonged scrutiny of the data. It proved two things. First, I'm not as much a closed-minded leftist as my critics like to claim and, second, that the Thernstroms are not as susceptible to error as people like me like to claim. (and it was interesting being labeled as gullible by my ever so fickle fans) This is an extremely important voice in the race-relations conversation. Give the Thernstroms credit for a job well done."
5,Excellent,"Mr. Lehman seems to be more concerned with who funded the Thernstrom's work, rather than focusing on the validity of their thesis. A tour de force, sure to be the most important book on the subject of race"
1,The authors have an Conservative agenda,"I agree with those who point out that the authors have an unstated agenda. They received their funding from conservative think tanks. And guess what! They think affirmative action is unnecessary!Many Americans are racist. Maybe not in Cambridge, but look at black sterotypes in movies and tv. Look at the fact there are no black actors who've won Oscars in so called Liberal Hollywood.Not good social science; a book with an agenda."
3,"Good but not as good as ""No Excuses""","Because I had enjoyed ""No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning"" I read the Thernstrom's previous book. ""America in Black and White"" provides a well-researched historical, contemporary, albeit conservative perspective on black-white race relations in America. In ""No Excuses"" they held back their strong opinions at least while presenting the information. However, in this one I thought that the Thernstroms allowed their opinions to interfere with the presentation of the prodigious factual information at their disposal. However, I still recommend the book because the data presented is worth having."
5,"""America in Black and White"" explodes myths, points way.","""America in Black and White"" is the definitive book on race in America. A landmark, it will be remembered for years to come. The Thernstroms exhaustively examine race relations from the dark days of Jim Crow to the present. Their conclusion: America has made great strides. Though panned by liberal critics committed to defending the indefensible -- the continued treatment of people according to their skin color -- ""America in Black and White"" stands tall as the definitive research on, and statement about, race in America."
2,General promotional copy misleading,"This may be a very fine headline book, but it is not what I was looking for. I ordered what I thought was a general book about headline writing, but this book is geared to an Indian college student audience - with all samples from the Indian press. Also, the history is very specific to Indian journalism with a section entitled ""Headlines in Pre-independence days."""
1,Disapointment,"I read a review of this CD in Real Detroit and decided to pick it up. This is defintley not a Rock N Roll band, they are more like NYSYNC with an edge. I will not knock any performer for what they do, but I feel I was mislead. The Cd really does not have any tracks that stand out as singles. The vocals sound alright but the album seems to drag from start to finish. I also caught these guys in Detroit and although I only saw the last 3 or 4 songs, I must say that the live show is 10 times more boring than the CD. If this is Rock N Roll than I must be Elvis Presley. I give these guys credit for trying but this is not a record that I would recommend.Gary Detroit, MI"
1,sick sick sick - beware my review contains spoilers,"If you want to read a book that is so twisted it sickening go ahead and read this book - if not steer clear.Plot -1) H sleeps with the 'Sister' leaves town not knowing she's pregnant (I've already lost the will to live here)2) H comes back finds out he has a son - but in reality always had hots for the 'Sister' = h ( of course, of course.. h is also in love with him - regardless of knowing he's slept with her 'sister' and left her pregnant)3) We find out the Sister - aka mother of H's child is in reality the Mother of the h. (keep it in the family... yip very romantic)Conclusion - H gets to sleep with Sister and Mother, h is left to raise the child until he makes his way back - .. wth? think i'll steer well clear of Penny Richards and her idea of what is romantic."
2,"Grim, yes, but rarely disturbing","Maybe I'm more densensitized to screen violence than I give myself credit for, but I didn't find this movie anywhere near as disturbing as ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (in a good way) or ""Happiness"" (in a stupid way). It certainly didn't distinguish itself from any number of other exploitation films on the same subject."
4,creepy!,"This is the type of movie which could leave you checking yourdoors and windows at night to make sure they are locked.HENRYis a charachter you might find anywhere.This is a disturbing lookat people you might calll neglected and passed over.And when they fall through the cracks,they become very dangerous.If youever watch this movie, make sure you are not alone and with somebody you trust.Don't expect a great movie but a well donecharachter study loaded with violence ang gore.What harm can one man do?Ask HENRY."
1,not good,"I was really disappointed in this movie. I thought it was at least close to a true crime movie and would be some how correct, but it isn't. I do not recommended it to any true crime fan."
1,Horrible Movie,"Im an avid Horror movie enthusiast and I was interested in this movie, but unfortunatly I was very disapointed. It's just a poorly put together film, with poor acting and I wouldnt recomend this to anyone. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.-Casey"
1,AWFUL & STUPID!!,"Can't believe u guys gives this movie 4 to 5 stars. Stupid & cheesy Unbelievable movie...is like ""firday13th""with Jason the killer, just thro bunch people and he killing them left and right and he never get caught!!But at least u accept that from that movie because is just slashes horror flick.But this movie about serial killer ,Where is police in this movie??/??Ever anyone see these dead bodies he kills in streets or homes, they don't have friends or family????/He kills all these people with bare hands, how come no police and finger printing or discover this killer before he goes further..And in End, he just kill another then BAM, ""THE END""!!. Leave u all cold, what the hell happened/?/?/very stupid ending and start with NO result or bit reality of the serial killer ,Don't believe these hips and all. Skip this lame movie don't make any sense! Wasting time and money for NOTHING!!"
3,mediocre,I was disappointed in this movie. I guess I was expecting it to be more authentic. It's still scary that there are real people out there like this. That's why you should train in realistic armed and unarmed self defense and always use the color code of awareness.
3,Henry Lee Lucas & Otis Toole,"This is a fictional account of the lives of two serial killers Henry Lee Lucas and Otis Toole, the later the alledged murder of the son(Adam Walsh) of the host of Americas Most Wanted. This film touches briefly on Henry's life at the time he meets Otis Toole while in Chicago, if that is even true. I read a book about these two losers,cowards,low life scum and the movie just barely comes close to what these two did. They both died in prison( the movie takes a differant view) where they were serving life sentences for murders they confessed to. A lot of these were to get attention. This is not a horror movie but a movie of what happens when two low life loosers are raised by monsters. By watching the news I am convinced there are a lot of Henry's and Otis's still around."
2,Please consider before you see,"I have seen many films that will stay with you long after the viewing of them. I rented this film because so many people on this website felt that this movie was so disturbing. Well, it's really not. I'm not saying this simply because I have a high tolerance for violence in films. But I'm saying it because this film is as scary as watching the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Friday the 13th"" for the first time today. It may scare some but for those of you who find the uneasiness of films like ""Irreversible"" more to your taste, it would be wise to pass this one up."
4,130min running time is deceptive,"There are two things which prevents this film from receiving the 5 stars that the contents merit. The first and main reason is that the 130 minute running time listed gives the impression that, since this is the directors cut, there are 47 minutes more than in the original VHS release. This isn't the case. The running time for the film is totaled along with the time for the suplemental materials. There is no additional material in the body of the film that I could discern (But the VHS screening copy I own may be different from the general release copy in the video stores). The second gripe that I have involves the lack of letterbox. But then again, they may not even have a letterbox version since the original intention for this movie was not to be shown theatrically, but on home video."
4,Disturbing horror movie.....,"The one thing that sets this movie apart from the other slasher movies is its tone..It's more realistic than Jason and Freddie(comic book stuff really)and doesn't glorify the violence.A great cast of unknowns(Michael Rooker is more known than the others)help make this more believable than some Hollywood actor..The direction,the pacing and the music blend together perfectly....You wouldn't want to watch this movie in a theater then going home...No Hollywood ending-thank goodness! As far as that ""viewer""that wants more sex is missing the point and should stick to Sorority Girl slasher flicks!"
4,"Good movie, bad DVD...","Let me just start by saying I liked the movie. Interesting plot, if a bit short. Both Michael Rooker and the guy who played Otis did a great job.Now, I rented this DVD from Blockbuster. It MAY have just been a bad copy, but the quality of this DVD was terrible. The sound was out of sync repeatedly throughout the movie. I'm talking wicked bad. Very poor. I would consider buying this movie, but not if all of the DVD's have this flaw."
4,Chillingly memorable,"Some of the scenes in this movie were so chilling and disturbing, I can't get the images out of my head. Worth seeing."
2,I'm Too Scared to Watch It.,"I may be a coward, but I have not seen this movie and I don't plan to. I was too frightened to see it when it was released in theaters over a decade ago, and the reviews I've seen here reaffirm my fears. ""There are other ways of learning about the hind feet of a mule, than being kicked by them."" -- Uncle Remus, ""Song of the South""In this ""review,"" I wish to discuss what happened to the real Henry Lucas, on whom this film was based. Several years ago, Texas Governor George Bush (now US President) commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. This was the only death sentence Bush commuted in Texas.It was shown that Henry was actually innocent of the murder he was convicted of. A time card had shown him to be at his job in Florida the day before the murder was committed in Texas. Also, many if not all of his several hundred murder confessions also appeared to be false, and even incredible.It just goes to show how different things can be from what you think you know."
2,dull,"This movie was so predictable.Henry is a stereo-type,his girl-friend is stoopid,his side kick probably has bad breath.No interesting insights and angles.He's just the same 'serial killer' we could find on cop programmes on t.v."
