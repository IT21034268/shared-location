4,This isn't the radio Melanie,"If you like live acoustic albums where the artist changes the presentation this is probably for you. The arrangements are very nice and the guitar work is superb. It has the feel of a live album but without all the clapping and audience noises. This is a great sit down and ""see how she can change her song"" album."
3,"Too many jumps, too many questions","Evil Eyes is the story of a writer, portrayed by Adam Baldwin, that finds that what he writes comes true, in a tale eerily similar to the true crime movie he happens to be working on. In that case, a writer director turned serial killer after everything he wrote came true.However, while this movie had the power to be fun and scary, like Stephen King's Dark Half, I had a few problems with the film.One: The editing style on the film is choppy, and the story jerks around quite a bit. Several times you're left wondering if what you saw actually transpired or if it only occurred within the realm of the story.Two: Even after one of his best friends is killed in a manner parallels a story he just wrote, the writer continues to picture friends in the scenes, or to write scenes about people he knows. This doesn't seem very logical to me.Over all this is one of the better films to be produced by Asylum lately, and it shows their growth as a movie house."
2,MORE LIKE DROOPY EYES,"EVIL EYES is a derivative a la Stephen King/Dean Koontz variety. A failing screenwriter (Adam Baldwin) is approached by a mysterious ""agent"" (Udo Keir) to write the screenplay based on a true story of a screenwriter who went mad and killed his mother, father and wife. As Baldwin begins writing his screenplay, it seems that the things he is writing start to come true, with tragic results for some of his friends.Veiled in inexplicable ambiguity, EVIL EYES never fully explains what is going on so the viewer is left with no sense of resolution or understanding. Vague film making at the least."
5,Rammstein!,It turned into my favorite T-Shirt and I absolutely love it! But it did have a flaw. The seem in the bottom in the back ripped out on the their wearing of the shirt. But I still love it! Yay Rammstein!
2,not very big,"I thought it would cover two burners. It covers the big burner and then the edges don't sit on any heat. If I would have looked into it better I would have known this, and I would have just bought the square one. I was looking for a two burner one for when I was cooking for more than two"
2,Siz is too small,"It says this is a 2 burner grill pan but that is so wrong. It does not cover 2 burners it sits in the middle of each burner causing the handles to be right ove both burners. Very dissapointing, I love the le creuset normally and was really looking forward to having a grill pan made by them. Unfortuanatelly due to the shape it will not work for just one burner either. Hopefully they will come out with an updated one, until then my search for a good 2 burner grill pan continues."
3,Hard to handle when hot,"Great idea, and easy to store for those of us with limited space. But if you're an amateur griller like me, it's too easy to push the grill pan off the burner while you're trying to flip food, especially if the food sticks. The handles are so close to the flame that it's hot on your fingers, and you have to hold the handles with the ends of your fingers with a potholder, so it's hard to get a good grip. I'm returning mine in favor of one with a nice big honkin' handle to hold it really well, at least until I'm better at grilling. Great idea though."
5,One that I did not bring from NY,This is one disc that I did not pack when I moved to Houston. I had it on tape but a brother of mine loved it and you know that story. I don't understand why no one pushed the student prince cut as this is a great song and playing that only Leo can do.
3,Good book,As a military man I deal with lots of injuries and rehab situations. This book is very good for helping with the people who tore their shoulders or knees or have hip injuries. They still have to work out with us so this gives them ideas of what they can do while we're doing other stuff.
3,Extremely clear illustrations and instructions,"This very small spiral bound book lies flat while you are trying to use it. The illustrations are clear and the instructions for the various stretches are clear as well. The exercises look accessible to anyone who can sit up in a chair, but as with any exercise book you need to be careful."
1,Don't buy this item!!!,This isn't even a good phamplet. It is an insult. Save your poor badly needed funds and don't let this con artist get your money.
1,Wrong part in a box,"Got wrong part in a box. Similar shape but different PN 33-2773 on the filter vs 33-2267 on the outer box. Unfortunately, none of mine friends drive Porsche to whom it could fit."
2,Incomplete explanations,"Explanations are often incomplete, only explaining why some (not all) of the wrong answer choices are incorrect. Unfortunately, this seems to be most common when there are a couple answer choices that both might be good options--it is in these situations where an explanation of why one answer is better than the other is most important, and it is in these situations where the ""second choice"" answer is conspicuously absent. For example, this book states that methadone is the best option for treating a heroine addiction, but even though buprenorphine is one of the answer choices no explanation is given as to why methadone would be a better choice."
4,Purchase review,My book purchase was in excellent condition and reached me in perfect time. The service was very good.
3,"Very soft, but there are issues","I really liked this blanket when I bought it. It's soft and cuddly. It's heavy enough for winter. My problem is that this is essentially two blankets sewed together and because it's not quilted it (I don't exactly know how to describe this) it comes apart and doesn't lay right or wrap right unless you lay it flat first.The embroidered ""baby"" is cute, but it makes the blanket a bit stiffer there.Very cute, but not very functional."
5,Central Station made a huge difference for me,"Prior to buying this box, I had my DAW's analog output directly connected to my studio monitors and used an old stereo receiver as a headphone amp. I would not have expected the Central Station to make such a huge difference to my way of working but it's been incredibly convenient to be able to control the system volume with a real knob, switch between studio monitors and a cheap boombox and to have the built-in headphone amp with plenty of volume. I can't explain why but being able to run my sound card (Digital Audio Labs CardDeluxe) at full output has made my mixes come out better in the form of crisper sound and better separation of instruments. Next step is to hook up the DAW's digital output to the CS so that I can have a custom headphone mix and leave it up during the tracking process without disrupting whatever mix decisions I've made. This box did exactly what I needed and helped me streamline my workflow without degrading my audio quality."
4,MBM's reivew of Guitar Hero 1,"""Iron Man"" is an excellent song for beginners, it only requires 3 notes while on ""easy"" and lets you feel a rock star. Parents will love the music from their generation; Boston, Black Sabbath, Heart and more. It's also a game for adults, they can be taken back to the days of listening to their music on 8 track players. You can choose the level of difficulty, and increase the difficulty of play as you become an expert."
5,Revolutionary,"Multiple difficulty levels, songs everyone knows and loves, and the ability to rock out with friends? No wonder Guitar Hero became such a phenomenon. With guitar classics that range from Deep Purple's ""Smoke on the Water"" and Motorhead's ""The Ace of Spades,"" the song selection is varied and deep.The only weakness this game displays is in its multiplayer - there's no cooperative mode and any competitive modes have to have both players on the same difficulty. Other than that, this is a game with no real weak points that can stand up well to the sequels it spawned."
5,Guitar Hero Rocks,Lots of fun even for a novice. Also bought the wireless flying V to make playtime even more exciting and not restrictive!
3,Guitar Hero 1,"This game is for people who like timed puzzle games. If you are expecting to learn how to play the guitar, you may be dissapointed. This seems like the type of game for those who like puzzles and have really good reflexes."
4,Great Game,"We purchased GH1 because we love GH2 so much. Though you get a bit more functionality with GH2, this is still a great game. The music is terrific and the game is a bit more forgiving in the scoring that GH2. All in all, it was worth it simply to get a few more great songs."
5,Guitar Hero 1,"This game was a hit with everyone this past Christmas! With plenty of songs to choose from, it was fun for all ages. Kids and Parents, and even Grandpa got in on the action! Now when we hear ""smoke on the water"" come on the radio It means Grandpa is a GUITAR HERO!"
3,Fun for a while,"As a party game, it's great... Back when it belonged to my roommate, it was fun... When I actually owned it, and could play it whenever I wanted-I got bored of it realllll quickly"
5,FUN!!!!!!!!!!!,It's an awesome guitar game and i love the songs that are on it. my sister and i play it all they time and the difficulties make it much more fun.
5,video games rock,guitar hero is a great game. My family plays it constantly. I guess you could say it's almost to much fun.
2,"The set looks nice, but low quality",perhaps you get what you pay for.I have a few discs that are hard to start playing and one that won't play at all. I was never contacted back about getting the disc replaced.The DVD set was not send with any foam or bubble wrap around it and so it was badly dented in shipment.
2,Lame Uebermensch,"There are a bunch of movies here, like 6 of them. Fortunately, each of them has the same quality special effects, acting, and script: lame. I know Superman is supposed to be kitchy, but from time to time, it seems that somebody is trying to break out of the box. It just isn't working, the box seems to be made of Kryptonite, because when they try to break out, it dies.I wish somebody would approach me to write a Superman script. I wonder if it would turn out just as much of a disaster as those 6 films. I mean, maybe Superman is like ketchup: whenever you pour it on something, it becomes the ketchup. Superman is the kitch ketchup. Anything you do with him turns into kitch.There was a Supergirl movie a while back, I think. And there was another film where it wasn't Supergirl, I think it was titled: My Girlfriend is a Superhero, with Uma Thurmann. That was pretty good, better than these 6 films combined.They are a bit too noisy to have on in the background or to try to fall asleep to..."
5,Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition,"Seen these movies when they were first released.Except Superman Returns.Good to see Christipher Reeves before the accident.Very entertaining,special affects good for the times then.Didn't realise the politics around the original Director of the Superman films."
5,Best Gift,I have not personally watched any of the videos and can only tell you that my step-daughter's boyfriend is a Superman collector and that he was beside himself over this present. He is thrilled with all of the extra DVD's included with the movies.Thanks Amazon for making me look good!!!!!!
5,Superman Flies Again...and Again....and Again....,"This collection is wonderful, for any Superman fan. The quality of the mastering and the bonus features make this the best Superman collection yet. With the addition of The Richard Donner Cut of Superman II and the latest movie, Superman Returns, this also the most complete. I highly recommend this. Despite the cool packaging, I do wish each movie was in a seperate box. It would make your DVD collection look bigger."
3,Still Waiting,"I'm still waiting for my replacements discs. It's been over a month now. What terrible service. Anyhow, the picture quality of this box set is not as good as the new James Bond box sets. I would think that the picture quality of a newer series would be just as good or better than an older series of films."
4,good anthology,"i continue enjoy a rather complete video anthology of a mythical super hero.our country needs hero that expresses the values and morality of the USA . . . . ""Truth, Justice and The American Way""."
1,superman ultimate collector's edition,"I bought two separate ""new"" collections from two different vendors and had to return both due to malfunctioning DVD's. The first DVD in both sets had a haze around the edges--don't know if this was the cause of the DVD locking up. Last DVD was full of scratches in the 2nd set and the 3rd one in the first set had scratches and didn't play. Both were shrink wrapped so wonder if they are having problems in the manufacturing or copying of the DVD's. Buyer beware."
2,dissapointed,I saved for months to purchase this set. It was almost unbelievable that Warner Bros was supposed to have cleaned it up. There were so many defective discs ... I returned it to Amazon for credit. I think it will be a long time before I ever purchse anotherWarner Bros. release.
5,Everything you could want for the Superman collector!,Bought this as a Christmas present for myself! Tons of extras and the movies are great to have all in one place. It took me over a week to view it all. Be aware that some of these sets have disks that are missing items. I had to call WB and request new disks which they replaced quickly. All the disks work fine but one disk is missing extras and another one is missing a sound track. You would never know these are missing but I was able to find out by going to different Superman fan sites were they were talking about the problems. But if you did not know they were missing you would never know you did not have them. Otherwise this is a wonderful collection! Enjoy!
5,Superman Collection,"This collection was worth the price. All of the movies that have been included have been viewed and produced great picture quality, and I have even come across a problem were there are more DVDs than I can handle. I have to make decisions with regards to which movie I watch and when since there are multiple disks for each movie (superman 1, 2, etc.). If you are a collector or just like to watch movies with your family or friends this set will be a great addition to your collection!"
1,Superman III disc is the old 2001 disc. :-(,"From DVDActive:Those of you who have pre-ordered copies of Warner Home Video's forthcoming Superman: Ultimate Collector's Edition might want to think twice. Due to a massive technical blunder, the Superman III: Deluxe Edition discs contain the original 2001 release of the film, rather than the advertised disc with commentary, additional scenes and a vintage featurette.Reports indicate that The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection and the individual release of Superman III: Deluxe Edition are unaffected. At this time there has been no word on whether or not Warner intend to issue replacement discs. Even if replacement discs are made available, non-US residents who purchased the set will most likely be left out in the cold."
1,Still sending out sets with defective disks,"As some may know, the initial shipments of this set went out with defective disks of Superman the Movie (wrong audio), and Superman III (film used old print and lacks special features). I just received my set today (Feb 23, 2007 - on the second attempt, actually; my initial order got lost in the mail) from Amazon (sent on Feb. 7, 2007) and it contained the defective disks.I am going to contact Warner Bros. to obtain replacement disks, but I thought people should just be warned that the defective sets are still being shipped out by Amazon."
5,You're still on the fence about buying this set? Let me help you out.,"Are you a comic book or a Superman fan?If yes, then buy this set.Are you a big DVD collector?If yes, get this set.Hate Superman?There's no way there's anyone like this. So, buy this set.This DVD set comes with every Superman movie and even the Superman serials, and some of the Fleshier cartoons. Over 100 hours of features, plus a Superman comic. This all comes in a nice tin that will grab the attention of the room where ever you place it. Trust me, this set is worth the money."
3,The Ultimate superman Collection,"This would be a great buy Except!!! Mine came shipped to my door missing disc #10 of 14 which really ticked me off, so now what do i do about this!!!"
5,A wish come true.,"I have been an avid comic book reader since childhood (and I am in my fifties now). This latest version is my favorite (not that I disliked the Reeve's versions). I was looking for the old cartoons for a long time. I remember as a child that they played it on television on occasion, but it was only in black and white at that time on our TV's.Thank youJBD"
2,Not worth it for the price,"i bought this 2 weeks ago at $24.99. i am not a superman's biggest fan but boy it was worth it..7 movies,over 20 hours of extras including documentry and old cartoons...plus a reprint of a comic book and a daily planet style menu...to top it the metal box seems very impressive on my shelf.but now its up to 75$...and when it is all said and done the movies arent that good. for 25$ its worth it to dvd collectors,superman fans,and movie fans in general..but at 75$ you need to be HARDCORE superman fan for this"
4,Replacement discs for International customers!,"My Superman Ultimate collection was sent by Amazon to me in Australia last week. I have not recived it yet, but when I do does anybody know how International customers go about getting their replacement discs through Amazon?"
1,Thank you all!,"Thank goodness for the reviews on the blunders of this set. I have it my shopping cart right now, and will delete it as soon as I'm done typing this. I cannot believe a company like WB can screw up like this. Then again...maybe I can. I'm not a die-hard Superman fan, so maybe this isn't for me, anyway. But if I were, I'd be extremely disappointed.Thanks for the heads up!"
5,Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition,"WOW!!!Five stars This set of films is the best way to watch the man of steel. If you love Superman and grew up reading and watching him, this is it!"
2,Great Box set BUT. . .,"I bought this in 2007 and in the space of a few months DVD rot took hold. Now I have a fancy box set with with NO usable DVDs. I bought it so I could show my kids (who are crazy for SUperman) what a GOOD Superman movie is, now I have resorted to finding these movie elsewhere and in a digital format. Not worth buying. If you do. . . RIP IT TO THE DRIVE AND OR BURN A COPY. . . otherwise fantastic collection."
2,"Product is great... Manufacturing, not so much!","The set comes in a cool tin case and has a bunch of cool extras. The only problem is two of the discs were covered in what looked like a a dusty glue solution that had to be cleaned off. Believe it or not those discs work fine albeit stained. However disc 3 of Superman 1 won't even load. Tried it 5 different dvd players, three computer drives and 2 home DVD players, with no luck. I've read about all the problems WB had with these sets and now I can personally attest to the fact... What a shame."
5,Superman - Ultimate Collector's Edition,"I'm not a movie snob, I wanted to purchase the complete movie collection for entertainment purposes; this fit the bill and I've enjoyed watching them."
1,simply appalled,"i am simply appalled at this. i also purchased the original version of this box set and yes, mine had two problems: i had the original DVD release of Superman 3 with no special features (which is really embarrassing considering it has the new Ultimate Collection label on the disc) and i didn't recieve the bonus disc for the theatrical version of Superman 2, i recieved two copies of disc 1. granted, i am happy this version is supposedly the right version of the set, but where does that leave people like me who shelled out the 76 bucks for the original flawed version? do i get a FREE copy of the corrected one or do i have to replace the ENTIRE set? this move makes me not want to buy anymore Warner's DVDs......i will however, but this is still truly disgusting."
4,The ultimate Superman,"This was a great box set, absolutly anything and everything i could have expected as well as a few additions."
2,I'd wait a little longer to buy this.,1. A couple of the discs are missing material. They play fine but Warner forgot to put some bonus stuff on them. They are replacing the discs but you have to mail them back. So I would just wait a little while longer to buy.2. The case they come in is total garbage. My case was broken in under 5 minutes. The binding completely fell apart and the discs fell out. So if you actually want to watch the movies buy something else to put them in because Warner WILL NOT replace the junk case the put the movies in.
2,no tin holder,"I ordered this product, but when it arrived . Their was no silver holder and case was falling apart. I felt that it should havebeen specified. I was also missing the index and the comic book"
2,A little more than just elevator muzak...,"Your best bet is to pay a little more and get a compilation fromthe Capitol Lounge series. This is primarily a mish mash of ""has beens"" not even on the top of their game. The only true spark of life hear is track #13 with Mae West babbling on during""Picado"". You'll be playing this disc for back, back, backgroundfor sure, as no one will be paying much attention."
5,"At times almost chaotic, always fantastic!","I first heard Affentheater while in Germany. Unfortunately most German music I heard was in English, but when I pressed my friends to show me some truly great German music they put in Westernhagen. At first I was confused--so many different sounds coming from the same man--but soon I began to deeply admire the talent he displayed. It is nearly impossible to get bored with this disc; there are heavy gutteral songs and light slow songs, deep introspective songs and critical political songs. I especially recommend ""Ich brauch ne Frau"" and ""Willenlos"", ""Unter meinem Fingernagel"" and, of course, ""Es geht mir gut""."
5,the bigest lost cousious music ever had,garnett silk is not dead he lives in his music the only singer i would match with the silk is sizzla i would of like to hear a whole cd with silk an garnett sometimes i think that may be jah took him from us because he has done his work for the human race his voice was like an angle we miss you from / wendell .. phillip
2,Not a great tournament poker book.,"With all of the books currently on the market about poker and, specificly tournament poker, this is not the one I would recommend. Sklansky's books about limit poker are excellent reads, however, this book is lacking of any advanced poker theory. For beginners, I would recommend any books by Tom McEvoy and T.J. Cloutier. For advanced players, I would definitely recommend the Harrington on Hold 'em books by Dan Harrington, both volumes. These are probably the best books on the market about no-limit hold 'em with some great ideas for the more advanced player. But leave the Sklansky book on the shelves."
3,There is better out there,"It is a quick read and give novices some very useful, important information on the adjustments to make for tournament play. However, in my opinion I would buy Harrington on Hold 'em Vol.1 and 2. The two books cover far more ground and give details on short-handed play in volume two."
3,"Good information to think about, but....","This book holds some good information, but if your not a ""numbers"" player then it will be of little use to you. I learned some good concepts and some great plays to add to my strategy but as for formulating a new strategy from this book... i would have to say no.Theory of Poker was great but this book was a let down..."
4,"Good information, bad writing","When I read this book, I had JUST finished playing my second-ever tournament, which I won. I was amazed to read this book and find that I had intuitively followed nearly every principle in it.The content here is solid and is directed at those aspiring to play tournaments - not experienced tournament players. However, that content is brought down by Sklanksy's usual difficult writing style.Bottom Line: worth picking up if you're new to tournament poker. Can probably be skipped otherwise."
1,Not a Good Tournament Book,"The major problem I had with this book was the fact it mostly covered limit holdem. There was only one chart on statisticsand it does not cover no limit holdem in depth like I expected. There was few helpful tips from the book. Introducing the ""gap"" concept-where you play loose when the table is tight. And strategic betting when you are about to get eliminated from a tournament other that that there isn't a lot of applicable stuff here. I will look to sell this book. For tournament books stick with Mcevoy."
3,Echoing the other reviewers,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is not terribly useful for advanced tournament players. Sklansky's Hold 'Em Poker for Advanced Players is a classic of the genre, but this is not the natural follow up for advanced players looking to up their tournament game.For that purpose, I recommend the groundbreaking two-set Harrington on Hold 'Em books that embrace and extend the Sklansky theories for tournament play. Everything other reviewers said they hoped would be in this book are in Harrington's book. If you've never played a tournment before, this is a decent (although somewhat dated -- written in the pre-Internet poker era) treatment."
1,No Luck,"I haven't received it yet and have been trying to email Amazon with no luck, It was sent on 3rd Dec to AustraliaThey promised to deliver by the 22 Dec if I bought before 4th Dec so I don't think I will ever buy a book from Amazon again. No book no review"
1,Not impressed,"This is not Sklansky's best work. The books does have 2 or 3 good concepts but the rest of the book is vague. I wish he had combined this useful info in another book. The rest of the book is junk, with some filler quizes and crap advice. I mean geesh...his discussion on final table play is horrible."
4,For Tournament Players Only...,"Extremely instructive if you plan on playing tournaments. Note that it covers all forms of poker, not just Hold'em, Omaha, or Stud."
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed reading this book and it was my first book on tournaments. I have to say, I thought it was useful and it did have some good concepts that I was able to use in my game."
5,The best Civil War epic ever!,"What makes this movie so powerful are the 5,000 Civil War re-enactors. They allowed no theatrical shortcuts to uniforms or equipment. They needed little rehearsal before filming the battle scenes. Their cannon made the artillery battle so riveting. Without them, the movie would have been just another theatrical release. Add to that the magnificant acting by Sam Elliott, Jeff Daniels, Tom Berenger, et. al., and the story based upon Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, and it couldn't be anything less than outstanding. If you can get it, I strongly recommend the director's cut, which adds about thirty minutes to the theater version, and gives far better continuity. When you get it home, hook the TV up to your stereo, so you can get the full effect of the artillery bombardment. Then enjoy a real experience."
5,Best Civil War Movie Ever,"If you're a fan of Shaara's book ""The Killer Angels"" you'll love this movie, as it doesn't stray from the book. If you're a Civil War history buff, you'll love this movie, as it portrays the situations, strategies, decisions and results of the most strategic 3-day battle on the North American continent accurately. It gives credit where credit is due and lets the blame fall where it may to both the North and to the South. The fate of the Union is at stake. It portrays the generals and the soldiers as the real people, with feelings, dreams and hopes. My girlfriend even liked this movie just for the story and the drama. Excellent cast, beautiful scenery and the largest civil war recreation ever on film."
4,Gettyburg,"This is a good long movie that doesn't feel long. I enjoyed it totally. Jeff Daniels finally had a character that I liked his as. I think he deserved an Oscar for this role. Unlike Gods and Generals, which is a long movie that feels longer, this was quite entertaining."
5,The most authentic war movie ever made,"Something that is very interesting about this movie besides the number of great things about it, is its authenticity. Ron Maxwell really went to great lengths to give us a quality film. Everything in the film is precisely the same material (the clothes, the guns, places), the same settings, even the same language. The genuine feeling that this movie gives me every time I see it is the emotion. All of the extras are civil war re-enactors another great link to authenticity. Everything about this film is incredible. Truly a landmark film in the history of cinema never to be surpassed ever again."
5,"Great movie, great price!","I saw this shortly after it came to home video back in the 90s, and ever since it has remained one of my favorite war movies ever. The screenplay and acting are both excellent, and from everything I've heard they well represent the book on which it is based,The Killer Angels. The movie does a great job of presenting the politics and philosophies of both sides, North and South, without passing judgment on either. It makes one realize that both armies had various complex reasons for fighting, only one of which was the issue of slavery. By thus humanizing both sides, it masterfully sets in contrast the tragedy of this battle (and indeed the entire war). Themusical scoreby Randy Edelman is perfect for the movie and very well sets the emotional tone throughout the film."
5,Awesome movie,"I highly recommend this true depiction of a really dark time in our history. We have watched it numerous time, and most enjoyed it after a trip to Gettysburg, PA touring the battlefield. The acting is superb."
3,"Not bad, fairly realistic civil war","This movie was a fairly realistic portrayal of the era, or so I'm told not having actually lived in that time. The acting by the major players was decent. The biggest negative is that it was intended to be a mini-series and it shows. Proper editing could have easily removed another hour from the length. That being said we did watch it all the way through with only a handful of breaks to look up more information on the internet."
3,"An Long, but Intriguing Epic!","This film was Ted Turner's baby. He wanted to produce a movie that re-enacted the bloddiest battle on American soil. When it was completed, the film was over 4 hours long. Much too long for theatrical release. So he premiered it on his cable network, TNT in 1993. The battle scenes itself are worth the long run time. It's not too graphic and works as a historical referrence. That may be it's downfall, as well. Another is the long stretches of dialogue. Though needed for continuity, after a while, the film started to suffer from overindulgence. If you can endure it's length, you might find this film rather entertaining. Give it a try!"
4,gettysburg,This film is one of the greatest reinactments I have seen. Michael Shaaras novel was brought to the screen with extream detail.
5,Beautiful reenactment of the bloodiest battle in our history,"This movie was, without a doubt, the best account of the bloodiest battle of the Civil War I have ever seen."
2,Blu Ray is barely an improvement,"This is a great epic. However, the extreme graininess of the blu ray makes it no differentthat the DVD. My system indicates general bitrates of about 15 mbps...compare that to 33 for the recent star wars.So for blu ray...not worth it if you already own the DVD."
3,OK if your a civil war buff,"Acting wasn't too deep. More like a TV drama which I think this might have been at one time. Lots of heavy handed speech making and soap boxing contrived to present morality to the audience in a way so as to make them not have to think too hard. I'm no civil war buff, but was curious to watch this movie after watching Ken Burn's CIVIL WAR documentary which was a far far better use of my time in every way. To sum it up, this film wasn't nearly as deep or interesting as it tried to be, but if TV-level drama is what you like then this is worth a watch. Civil War buff would like it, but it really was made for folks who really don't know much about the civil war and probably will never show a deep interest."
4,WHY ONLY ONE DISC,"You have got to understand. I love this movie. Being a reenactor myself, i take great pride in watching the movie not only for historical purposes, but to also see some of my friends in it as well. BUT WHY one disc?? Why do I have to turn over the disc to watch the second half of the movie. Its a shame. Movie like this coming out on dvd. Its what dvds are specially known for, their compression to have more room on a disc. Why not just have the movie itself on one disc and the extras on another. I would well pay the extra money for it. For that I give this dvd 4 stars. Maybe in the future they will reconsider their fault and make it 2 discs."
5,One of the best movies about the America Civil War,Like this movie so much I decided to buy a Blu-ray copy. Never get tired of watching it because of the way it details the lives of so many civil war heros.
5,An Epic Film,"I love reading and learning about the Civil War. This film provides a thought provoking and thoughtful portrayal of the people who served there. I saw this movie when it was released at the theater many years ago. I have practically worn out my VHS, yes VHS release of this film. It gets better every time. Now I see it is on Blu-Ray so I will purchase it. My hats off to the wonderful job the actors did in their recreations of these historic individuals. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone, especially those who have an interest in the Civil War."
5,"An excellent, emotionally ""charged"" depiction of the Battle","Soldiers laying it on the line for what they believed in...so we all could live free... This movie is a visual memorial to all those who died, and to those who lived to pass on the legacy of the ""true"" price of freedom. Thank you Mr. Maxwell for bringing it to so many people's attention."
3,"A VERY average movie, but after seeing ""GAG""... okay, it's not so bad.","Yes, silly, terrible beards... very slow, plodding battle scenes (nothing about the real battle of Gettysburg was slow or plodding), but it's an OK movie overall. Some great moments, some great shots, but it could be as long as it is and be much, much more exciting. I think Sheen is miscast, much too small and soft-spoken to be Lee, Costumes are crappy, but great scale and after seeing ""Gods And Generals... well, this movie doesn't seem as bad. I first saw it in a special pre-release preview in 1991 and at the time gave it a C-... It's a solid C now. Has aged pretty well over time, but still a definitive, ""great"" movie on Gettysburg hasn't been made yet."
2,Poorly Done,I really don't think this movie does a good job of capturing the realism of combat or the actual events at Gettysburgh. The dialogue and acting is also very poor.
2,would not play smoothly,Probably a great film but would pause every ten minutes or do to load. Just could not get into film with all the pauses.
2,Review of Gettysburg DVD,"The DVD arrived damaged. I returned it for a ""refund"" which was handled quickly. The movie itself was very good until it would no longer play."
4,An Outstanding Movie Minus One,"This is a great movie and Civil War movie. I ordered it from Netflix and liked it so much that I bought it from Amazon. There are some memorable actors from generals to foot soldiers. The dialogue is authentic and the situations historically correct.There is only one negative performance in the movie, and it is a biggie. It does detract whenever he is on the screen. Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee is one of the most miscast performances I have ever seen in any movie. He has the whiniest, hokiest Southern accent of any actor I have ever heard. He is distracting and painful to watch and hear. I enjoyed him in West Wing but not this role.Recommended with the reservation that Sheen is a terrible Lee."
5,Civil War,For this price you can't go wrong owning this DVD .You get 2 disc with great sound I really enjoyed this video.
5,Gettysburg,This is one of the finest representations of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. I highly recommend it.
4,Historical Referance,"I found this movie to be an excellant composite of historical facts and charactors.Heavilly based on the book ""Killer Angels"" by Michael Shaara."
4,Good teaching tool,"While the ultra-purists may criticize this movie, many of the battle and camp scenes are excellent teaching tools for young people seeking to understand the realities of life in Civil War armies. And the artillery barrage that preceded Pickett's charge isn't duplicated anywhere else on film."
4,"A very good movie, certainly worth seeing","Gettysburg is a good movie, quite faithful to the book ""Killer Angels"" on which it is based. The author of ""Killer Angels"" states in his book that his work is NOT intended to be a precise historical reference. Instead, it is a great story, based on historical events with a fair amount of poetic license.The movie is a great visual experience. Literally thousands of volunteer re-enactors participated in the making of the film. These fellows would be the first to tell you that the movie is a ""historical novel"" and not a precise re-enactment. But, that said, no movie I have ever seen is Gettysburgs equal on the subject. Perhaps ""Glory"" comes close.I recommend this movie to all."
5,One of the greatest and truest historical depictions ever,I have practically worn out my video of this movie. It is so good. It's amazing how closely it follows the book and gets into the mood of the time. All without the usual obligatory vulgarities and sex that most modern films have to have! The truest test of how great this film is can be seen when you randomly freeze the frame--you'll notice that almost without exception you will have a perfectly framed picture. Awesome!
4,Outstanding Family Movie,"The presentation left out some key facts like why JEB Stewart was late, and how the Union Army gained initial control of Little Round Top. The Little Round Top battle centered on the 20th Maine and not enough on the other regiments. The battle of the Wheat Field changed hands several times and I did not see where it was shown at all. The movie did a good job in depicting the stress and stuggle of ""brother"" fighting ""brother"". After touring Gettysburg, it was very interesting to see the action on film. I will watch it again and again. We need to learn from history. It could have been shortened some but not significantly. The music was a little much at times but still OK. Good and room for more: Maybe a more extensive video of each day with a bit of drama added. Perhaps a story centering on one of the characters and their family (assuming there is enough information) in a part 1, part 2 part 3 type of production with each day ending in summary fashion."
2,Average at Best,"Gettysburg is a mediocre reproduction of Michael Schaara's historical novel the Killer Angels. There are some parts of Gettysburg that are quite good, such as Pickett's Charge and the 20th Maine's defense of Little Round Top, but the excess speechifying and moralizing, along with some poor casting choices and poor production qualities, hurt this movie badly. Killer Angels the book gets a strong 5 star rating, Gettysburg the movie gets a tepid 2 star ranking at best. Gettysburg is not nearly as good as Glory, but it is mildly better than Gods and Generals.The history of the Civil War is replete with interesting stories to tell, why can't the people at Turner Productions hire the best directors and cast to do the job right instead of cheaply and swiftly ? Turner productions is the fast food of TV & motion picture entertainment, and Gettysburg and Gods & Generals are their blue plate specials - bring your antacid when you sit down to watch them."
1,blue ray is garbage,"this movie on blue ray, all it does is skip & freeze, no matter how you clean the dvd a waste of money"
2,too long,"gettysburg on both tv,the movies,dvd and vhs is not a movie for the general public only for civil war buffs who can sit through a movie that is four hours long.this movie was so long that there was exactly an intermission on the dvd.BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE IT GO AHEAD AMIGOS..."
5,Great Movie!,"I love this movie, as well as Gods and Generals. I just hope that The Last Full Measure is also made into a movie."
5,"question, hollywood","It's a great movie. I bought it, watched it, and will watch it again. However, I'd much rather watch the extra scenes version. So why can't I buy that on DVD? I saw it once on TBS. I know there was a VHS version out there about a decade back. But I haven't heard anything about the longer version since."
5,Makes an awfully confusing battle clear as day,"This movie is beautifully superb. Very accurate on almost every aspect of The Civil War and the battle, which is very hard to do. A great screenplay, great directing, great acting, a great movie. Period"
4,Very good film about Longstreet and Chamberlain.,Confederate general Longstreet and Union colonel Chamberlain(later a general and medal of honor recipient) were two fine officers on opposing sides in the U.S. Civil War. I highly recommend this film as it shows how individuals can make a significant difference in other peoples lives.
5,Excellent Civil War History,"The history of the Civil War as it entered Gettysburg, Pa. , fighting thru Gettysburg and the third day, the South was badly defeated just south of Gettysburg. Even though smashed, the South still fought on for two years before their surrender. A well done movie and very close to truthful happenings."
4,Gettysbeard,"This is an awesome movie, and a real epic. While true that up close it is not very bloody and people stay intact, it still gets across well the scale of the battle. While being impressed by the bravery of Picket's Charge it still seems stupid and forlorn, and maybe it wasn't so clear cut on the day to those taking part. Even so I thought Martin Sheen was convincing as Lee, while Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Richard Jordan as Armistead were excellent. My only quibbles for me were the unconvincing Oirish sergeant and the sniffy British observer. The unpaid extras were great and must have had a wonderful time."
4,Gettysburg Very Nearly Perfectly Accurate,"As a Civil War buff, I found the film to be very historically accurate with only a few fictional moments. Ronald Maxwell undoubtedly researched this battle for years and came out on top of all other depictions of that battle that turned the war. The defense of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge was so real that I had to visit the site once again to replay it in my mind. Sheen as Lee was brilliant, Berenger portrayal was irreproachable and the casting of the entire film was near perfection. The part of Sgt. Kilrain, while fictional, was inspirational and encompassed the spirit of someone who must have been in that battle. While more men died at Gettysburg in three days than in the entire Viet Nam war, one has to be seriously moved to imagine the scope of that battle that changed the war and saved the nation. ""Gettysburg"" will remain in the halls of great films forever."
3,"""Gettysburg"" is great, but it could have been better...","Yes, there are great special effects. And yes, it is very accurate - EXCEPT... Robert E. Lee is, just like he was portrayed in ""The Killer Angels"" (which I think is NOT as great a book as I would think would win such honors) a WIMP who is short, fat, and unsure of himself. All the other actors were very superb. However, I would add, that it did seem a bit over-sentimentalized. Meaning, it added LOTS of extra drama with the music and camera views... which is great, but a bit overdone. Life isn't like that. While you've got to put situations and people in the spotlight as necessary, I think they overdid it just a bit, making it kind of slow at times. Overall, great - but I think it could have been better."
2,Poor Copy,"It is a great story, Unforunately the quality of the sound was very poor. Had to turn up the volume and then got a loud buzz."
5,Gettysburg is a big hit,"Gettysburg, perhaps the most well known battle of The American Civil War, is an amazing movie to every history buff. The movie Gettysburg is created from the book The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. With a great cast and story it is not even a question why I gave Gettysburg five stars. This movie shifts from Union to Confederate sides showing plans of attack and reason of fighting the war. The battles are present through the entire length of this movie. As all three days of the battle are shown it is an incredible site to see especially the final day. Picketts' charge is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The speeches provide courage and bravery for the men as they walk into Union ground accross an open field."
3,could have been better,"Movie was slow. The amount of film used could have been about half and been more entertaining. Lee was shown in a negative light, and no mention of General Custer heading off J.E.B. Stuart as he headed for Gettysburg. Otherwise an adequate use of time."
2,Overbearing Soundtrack,"The first 2 hours and twenty minutes of this 4+ hour movie had about 2 hours of soundtrack that overpowered the dialogue and the sounds of battle. It was so irritating that I finally had to stop. I like a good soundtrack but this was not one of them. It was WAY too sentimental and over dramatic. And it never clicked with the film. Maybe one day there will be a director's cut that deletes about 80% of the score. Until then, I won't be watching the second half of the movie."
3,A Great Epic hiding poor performances,"It is very hard to bash this movie. The shots are great (when else do you get the feeling of 100 cannon firing at once.) The script is fine, the cameos are fun (Ted Turner, Ken Burns) And little round top was clearly Epic. I have watched this movie over and over for the battle scenes, but....It still seems to be missing something, it took several viewings to figure it out, but what it is missing is acting. I have never seen so many bad performances by good actors. Tom Beringer and Martin Sheen were not believable in their roles. Jeff Daniels , I could just see Dumb & Dumber. Jeb Stuart wooden. John Bell Hood, wooden.There were just too many subpar performances, it took away from the few fine ones, ( Lang, Gordon, Howell Conway.) The real stars were in my opinion the reenactors from all over who considered this a labor of reverance. It is worth watching for their sakes.I only hope we will see better from the prequel."
3,Good movie that could have been GREAT,"A really good movie that could have been GREAT except for the nearly constant, annoyingly unnecessary music. At times it drowned out conversations (why is there music for a conversation?), battle sounds (first war movie ever that the sounds of battle were overpowered by music), and even drowned out artilary sounds. The moronic idiot in charge of the music for this movie should be banished from the face of the earth. They could not even create appropriate martial music. Violins for a war movie? DIPSTICK!Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition)"
1,"A BAD MOVIE - a depressing movie about a sad, sad story","I'm not rating the movie itself, or its ingredients, I'm rating the feeling it creates. Of course, in the first place, the story it tells is a terrible nightmare that came true, just like WWI and II.Concerning, the movie : the quality of images, the light, the music, the noise,the soundtrack , the historical reports , the costumes down to the hats, the technology, all the techincal details are prefect, even TOO perfect in a way (how can I dare say that). Most actors are fabulous, the performance is great. Some scenes are excellent, some squarely bad or depressing.However, among all the sadness, I also perceived a lot of underlying irony, and I can understand part of it but I also hate it ; I felt mostly uneasy watching this movie from start to finish.The final charge of the Virginians led by Pickett is terrible and very moving; in one way it is an example of utter courage, faith and sacrifice, but such a big mistake essentially."
5,Gettysburg,Great movie! If you have home theater so much the better. I saw the movie in the theater and this is just as good. The first half of the movie looks at the battle for Little Roundtop from the North's perspective. Th second half looks at Pickets Charge from the South's Perspective. This is where the stereo sound comes in. The cannonade before Pickets Charge is spectacular. It also has bonus of the Making of Getttysburg which gives an insight on how the movie was made. GREAT MOVIE One of my favorites
5,Gettysburg,"This super-fine movie, was originally aired on Turner Network Television or commonly known as ""TNT"", as a short Mini-Series. Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen, Richard Jordan, Jeff Daniels, and Sam Elliot, just to name a few of the Actors involved in this very good movie on the bloodiest battle of the Civil War. I had taped it from TV minus the commercials, when it aired, I also bought the VHS Tape set of two, and now have bought the DVD, a very good movie offered by Amazon, a must see for Civil War Buffs!"
5,Very Moving and Insperational,Great Sound Track comes accros over my system puts me right in the center of the action. Very moving and emotional story. It is one of the ones I will treasure and keep in my extensive collection of war movies.
3,Well,"This movie was good, but the book was much better. I was a little disappointed by the portrayal of the main characters in the movie."
5,Gettysburg Director's Cut Purchased from Amazon,This was an awesome version of the orginal. The battle scenes were more realistic and the bayonet charge down little round top felt as though I was somehow running down that hill side with the men from Maine. The extra scenes showing the beginning of the battle put more understanding of the importance to stop and hold the high ground for the Union Army. I highly recommend this version to anyone interested in the Battle that turned the Civil War.
5,Gettysberg,This is another Ted Turner masterpeice.I've seen this movie many times and I'm amazed how well it is done.In a way it's like being there.It's hard to imagine swo many Americans being killed in a 3 day battle.Martin Sheen played Lee and did a incrediable job.The entire show is well casted from top to bottom and interesting througout.A Must have .Gilbert Campagna
4,Video of Gettysburg,"For those whe are interested in the American Civil War this is the wonderful movie to watch because it accurately follows Michael Shaara's book Killer Angels, a book that American historians have praised."
3,A Sadly Flawed DVD,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Gettysburg in the theater and on VHS, I excitedly preordered it on DVD when it became available. After watching the DVD version I am extremely disappointed in the formatting. Such a superb visual production should demand an anomorphic letterbox format that would give the viewer the whole picture. This DVD doesn't - it merely gives one a cheap TV-style format. What a waste of a great movie! I still love the movie itself but this decision by the DVD's maufacturer is a major mistake."
5,superb from start to finish,i had the good fortune of seeing this movie during its limited theatrical release in 1993. i left the theatre with puffy eyes and muscles sore from four hours of tension. this movie will make you want to buy a bigger tv. outstanding.
4,A Great Civil War Epic,"I first saw this film a couple of years ago. It was a great effort to attempt a realistic account of those terrible three days in 1863 when the history of the United States was changed forever. A little slow in parts but this can be overlooked as the battle scenes are extremely well done, although perhaps not as realistic as Saving Private Ryan. Many of the men who survived the battle suffered terrible injuries which left many of them losing limbs, but not their spirit. A must see film if you want to develop some understanding of what Gettysburg was all about. Many good performances from Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, and the late Richard Jordan who portrays General Armistead who died two days after the battle."
4,Historically important Director's cut.,"It is unlikely that anyone anytime soon will recreate the battle of Gettysburgin the stirring detail that Ron Maxwell did. This Blu-ray versiongives several scenes not in the theatrical release and that makes this versionimportant, historically. However, the difference in image quality between the originalDVD and this Blu-ray version is quite minor in my opinion. Buy this not mainly for Blu-raybut for the expanded length and special features not seen in the original DVD release."
2,Martin Sheen ruined the film,"This movie was excellent except for the depiction of General Robert E Lee which was absolutely horrible. Martin Sheen's depiction of a snivelling, second guessing, wimp was so off base. Casting Sheen as Lee was a total blasphemy of Lee's character. Regardless of his service to the Confederacy, Lee was an outstanding leader, intelligent and strong, You would expect to see a bigger then life man motivating and captivating his troops while standing strong and true. Whoever made this casting decision made the wrong one. Every other character and aspect of this film was almost true to life...it is an excellent experience if you can get past the scenes with Sheen. ...but, to be truly honest, Martin Sheen really ruined the film for me which is the reason why I have never viewed it again since it was released."
3,Gettysburg on DVD,"Gettysburg is one of my all time favorite movies, but not on DVD. Too many scenes have been edited out of the video tape version. If you want to see the best and most complete Gettysburg get the video."
1,Movie froze many times,I have Netflix as well and never have this problem.....this movie froze numerous times which took away from the viewing experience
1,This sux.,"The blue ray version stinks. The original widescreen production was chopped to fit the hd size tv's. It loses alot due to the cropped picture. The addition scenes are worthless, and I see why they endeed up on the cutting room floor. I'll give it away and watch my original DVD copy thank you."
3,"Good movie, really long","The movie arrived on time and exactly as described, but it's really long. However, if you LOVE the Civil War, this movie is for you."
3,Ok,"I hadn't seen the movie in some time so I enjoyed watching it. However, the best part of the moive(the last 30min) skipped very badly. I suppose you get what you pay for."
5,"Richard Jordon, Jeff Danials, Michael Sharaa",Mostly I wanted to say what a great job Richard Jordon does with Armisted. I just now see that Jordon died of a brain tumor. I always wondered what happened because he was a very good actor. A wonderful swan song as Jordon was dying as he played this part. Armisted is tormented by the war because his dear friend Win Hancock is on the other side. Jordon plays this wonderfully. It is so important in the Sharaa trilogy and I am thankful such a fine actor received the chance to do this. I think Steven Lange is better cast as Pickett than he was as Jackson. Daniels is perfect. The whole production is very good. I can watch it over and over. I wish Gods and Generals had been edited as well as this was.
4,Gettysburg,"I liked this movie very much, but yet I do believe that if it were made at the same time Gods and Generals was, it would have been a much better film. I thought that Sheen did a fair job at playing the great General Robert E. Lee, but he is no match for the outstanding performance of Robert Duvall. I like Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, who was also from my native state, South Carolina. Jeff Danials did a spectacular job in this film as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in Gettysburg as well in Gods and Generals. The effort these actors put in to this movie are so dramatic, it takes your breath away to see these men, in fact, you don't see Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, or Jeff Danials, you see Robert E. Lee, Jamse Longstreet, and Joshua Chamberlain. But I must say, if you are going to watch Gettysburg, you mite want to watch Gods and Generals first."
3,A must for Civil War buffs but others may be less excited,"""Gettysburg"" is an epic recreation of this pivotal battle of the US Civil War.It combines huge battle scenes with intimate conversations among the famous personalities including Lee, Pickett, Armistead, Longstreet on the Confederate side, and Hancock and Chamberlain on the Federal side.Standout performance are Tom Berenger as the cautious Longstreet and Martin Sheen as the legendary Robert E. Lee.At over four hours in length ""Gettysburg"" will test the patience of many viewers. It has feel of a mini-series and would be ideal to spread over two nights rather than watching it in one go. The characters indulge in a little too much speechifying and some of the battle scenes - staged using Civil War reenactors - seem a bit tame - but overall this is a well-made film.(****) for Civil War buffs and (***) for everybody else."
5,Gettysburg - Visit the Battlefield,"For all it's worth this movie at least makes people want to study the civil war and perhaps gets them out to Gettysburg to learn how the battle really occured.Even though the beards were at times badly done and the acting was over dramatic, this film will give you a good basic knowledge of what occured in July of 1863"
5,An important and excellent movie,"There aren't nearly as many films devoted to the American Civil War as there should be. Gettysburg, the best of the bunch, is just amazing. That's all, amazing. I can't think of any other word more suitable."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"The movie seemed historically accurate as told from the Union side. Unfortunately, the movie leaves out many important battlefield events--events like the ""battle of the wheatfield,"" or the fighting in the orchard. Much is left out. My main complaint was a lack of passion in this movie--a lack of emotion. The characters walk into the battle like toy soldiers, albeit colorful ones. They seem to take pride in a lack of emotion. On every level, this movie fails to show the stress of battle, the fear, the hatred, the horror or emotion of human beings shooting each other down by the hundreds like cattle on a smoky, choking, dusty, noisy, confused battlefield. Maybe I am missing the point, but I just could not feel this movie--it lacked emotion, and I probably would not watch it again."
3,Gettysburg 1993,This video was purchased for my grandson for Christmas. He was very pleased with this movie.
3,Shorter Is Sometimes Better,"I just finished watching this movie for the third time since its release. I still haven't found Ted Turner in the ranks of Confederates but Alfred Hitchcock look-a-likes abounded. I don't think there were very many Civil War troops who were candidates for lap band surgery.On the bright side, this is a story that needed telling but four hours worth? Turner's bias shows in portraying the Confederates as noble defenders of liberty with strong personalities. Union troops were mere androids (Chamberlain's 20th Maine the exception). Kudos to Jeff Daniels for a fine job portraying Col. Chamberlain. Cut the campfire prattle and the remaining 2 1/2 hours would be a pretty good and accurate film.In September, I'll be in Gettysburg for my fifth visit. I make a point of paying respects to those buried there - especially the unknowns. This time, I think I'll add an apology for the shoddy treatment of Union soldiers by Mr. Fonda."
1,non appearance,since you haven't actually sent me this dvd I don't know how you expect me to review it. Up to you.
2,"Long, violent Civil War movie","This would be a lot better movie if it wasn't so long. There is only so much violent warfare that I can take in one sitting, and this movie has about one hour more than my limit. The movie is also a lot more sympathetic to the North than the South. This movie certainly makes me glad that I didn't have to participate in the Civil War."
1,Boring,"This film was on TV a few years ago and I tried to watch it. One of the first red flags was Martin Sheen playing General Robert E. Lee. Egads! What an insult to General Robert E. Lee! Robert Duvall was a much more believable Robert E. Lee in ""Gods and Generals."" And did you know that Robert Duvall is a descendant of General Lee? Yes. Click on the trivia facts link on the ""Gods and Generals"" page here at Amazon. Duvall even kind of looked like Lee, which I cannot say for Sheen.I have seen some negative reviews of ""Gods and Generals"" saying it was too much dialogue and not enough battle. Thats interesting, since I thought ""Gettysburg"" was too much talk, and just plain boring. And sorry to repeat myself but Martin Sheen playing Robert E. Lee puts this movie in the toilet for me."
1,Wrong run time delivered on a good movie,There are two run time versions of this movie.This listing had it at 261 minutes which I have only seen on TV and has some interesting added material to the 254 minutes length of the origional release.As I had purchased a 254 minute length DVD years ago I was disappointed to get another 254 minute version on this order. I didn't want 2 of the same length.It was only 8.99 so not worth sending back.
4,Sheen is awful,"Sheen's Robert E. Lee makes him look like a ""Weeble"" on a pony. You remember the child's toy...""Weebles Wobble but they don't fall down"". His zombie-like performance and slovenly appearance do not fit the historical figure at all. Aside from the above and Ted Turner giving himself and Ken Burns embarrassing cameos, and some really ""cheesy"" beards throughout, the rest of the movie is quite good. Hollywood will never get it ""right"", but this is a noble effort."
5,great soundtrack,"Simply put, this is the best movie I have ever seen. I particularly enjoyed the story being told from both sides (the North and the South). Also, it has THE best soundtrack. If you liked it, check out the Dragonheart soundtrack."
3,A relative disapoointment if one expects footnotes...,"This book is, on the one hand, convenient to have, as it contains all the works of the Bard in one spot. On the other hand, for those of us who grew up weaned on the individual Arden editions in school, with their gloriously thorough footnotes, this is bound to disappoint.I guess this is a good volume to have to ensure you have everything, from womb to tomb, soup to nuts. Then, hie oneself off to look for the older individual editions for the footnotes we crave. Nice to have (a bit pricey, even as big as it is), but not really complete."
1,beware: false advertising!,"I purchased this work for my niece for her graduation from high school. She preferred this edition because she liked the way it looked: all handsome in its red cassette. So I ordered it for her. But behold: the picture doesn't match the actual product! What you get doesn't come in a handsome red cassette, but actually is the oversized regular version with its rather dull jacket.After complaining about this to Amazon, the image mysteriously disappeared for a while, but now it seems to be back. No doubt misleading many more oblivious customers into paying for something they in the end aren't getting. So Amazon: please remove this image, and place the correct one, so at least customers know beforehand what they are getting."
1,Poor quality printing,LOVE Shakespeare and was looking forward to reading his works again. Print quality is so poor- skinny font and faded ink- that I can't read it. Had someone with better eyes than mine look at it and they agreed with the poor quality and illegible print.
4,Fine as a reference,"Arden's edition of Shakespeare's works is an essential item in everyone's shelter. It's a great buy (for a carefully sought edition), but it lacks the critical discussion of the single-play edition."
2,"Reader, Beware!","For those of us who love (and rely on) the individual editions of the Arden Shakespeare, the Complete Works is a huge disappointment. What has always made the Arden editions stand out from the others is the in-depth scholarly analyses and copious footnotes. The footnotes alone are worth the price of a copy but, guess what? In this edition, they've disposed of all but the most general of critical apparatus. Unfortunately, this serves to make this complete edition just another big book to put on your shelf to impress your friends. Curious readers who want assistance with the complex Elizabethan language in the plays will be much better served by the Folger or Bantam editions. That is, at least until someone gets smart and brings back all the individual Arden editions that have been allowed to go out of print! What were they thinking?"
2,I must agree,"I must agree with the reviewers who rated this volume so low because of the lack of footnotes. I remember being introduced to the individual Arden copies when I was acting in college - the footnotes were SUPERB, much better, more authoritative, more in-depth than anything else out there. I was hoping for the same with this collected works - but was quite disappointed not to find it."
2,What happened to the notes?!,"I bought the famed Arden ed. of the Works of Shakespeare, shrink-wrapped. I peeled it open in glee...opened it...and...and...NO NOTES! What a waste of hard-earned money. I'd say stick with the individual plays in the Arden series in paperback. Sheesh!! (I rate the ""book"" two stars; Shakespeare gets five.)"
2,Not for Teaching,"I have taught several Shakespeare classes with several different texts. In the interest of my student's pocket-books I chose this complete works. The lack of editorial notes makes it unusable in class. I am also surprised by the decision to alphabetize the plays rather than arrange by date of composition (or presumed date of composition.)This is a sturdy volume, for a paperback, which is a mark in its favor, but the Riverside will be my edition of choice in all future classes."
2,Incomplete Works,"As an actress, I often use the individual Arden play texts. The footnotes are numbered as such and touch on not only definitions, but expressions, historical figures, and locations. These appear at the bottom of the page where the word or phrase appears. This ""in-complete works"" lacks these. It contains only definitions in a glossary at the back of the book. Not helpful in the world of acting and even less so as a teaching reference. Very disappointing."
4,Good comprehensive edition,"Even without the notes I've found this edition more than helpful. It's good to have the complete playtexts as verified by the Arden team in a single volume. It also includes introductions by the Arden editors which are very useful.I wonder if the skeptics realise that a Complete Works with all the Arden notes would run to about 10,000 pages? And just for the record (to the best of my knowledge) all the Arden single editions are still in print.A very comprehensive and valuable edition. Mighty pretty-lookin' too..."
4,"Dark, yet romantic...","200 yr. old reluctant vampire Barnabas Collins and Victoria Winters intensify their relationship. The scenes in this episode are full of suspense and intrigue, especially when Barnabas's vampirism is almost discovered after Dr. Julia Hoffman tries to cure him. This is yet another fantastic episode in the short-lived 1991 series. Ben Cross is fabulous as Barnabas."
3,"Good, not great",The story was going so well. Characters were interesting and the sense of closure was near. Then ??? What happened? West needed to write another couple of chapters.
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I know I'll get criticized for not ""getting"" this book. I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this. Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts. The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today. Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone."
1,"Great story, horrible publisher","NOTE: This review is for the Indo-European Publications edition of this book. I am reviewing this specific edition, which is horrible, not the story itself, which is great.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! It is full of misspellings and typos, all of which are distracting and make one wonder if there are other major errors and omissions that would go unnoticed by someone not familiar with the story. The novel deserves much better than this. Find a better publisher, and enjoy the book!"
2,Decent Book - Terrible Print,"I bought the hardcover version of the book and was disappointed with the quality; it feels very cheap, and is definitely not worth the price paid.It has no jacket and is riddled with typos - sometimes so much so that it could change how you interpret the book.However, the content itself is decent and I recommend giving it a read, just make sure to buy a trustworthy copy."
2,An exercise in pessimism,"The Day of the Locust takes place in Hollywood in 1939, at the end of the depression and the brink of World War II. The book is a character study of the interactions of various hanger-ons at the edges of the motion picture industry. The book is written in a tone of absolute dispair, and it tries to point out how pointless dreams and wishes are. There is no joy to be found in sunshine, oranges, the ocean, life... My optimistic soul wanted to rage against the author and the characters. I guess I can understand how a Jewish man would feel a sense of pessimism in 1939, but I can't recommend the book as anything but an example of the wrong way to see the world."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a depressing book. There is nothing in it but busted dreams, unfulfilled lust, misery and sadness. Don't waste your time reading it. Just listen to the song, ""Maneater"", by Nelly Furtado and you will have the gist of the story!!"
2,Typos!,"This kindle edition of THE DAY OF THE LOCUST has a lot of typos. The first chapter alone has three, including ""truculent"" spelled as ""truculentas"" (Is it being typed in a Tiajuana chop shop?). Annoying. I will read on a bit, but if I find many more, I will be returning the book."
2,"Shoddy, unprofessional copy - don't buy it","I bought this to teach to high school seniors instead of the New Directions edition, which also contains Miss Lonelyhearts. I was attracted by the interesting cover, but the inside copy is not professionally laid out. There are misspelled words and the formatting is way off. Lines break in some places for now reason at all. The paragraphing needs work, too. It seems to me that this was rushed to press without quality control. Seeing how the New Directions edition is cheaper,and contains Lonelyhearts I see no reason to buy this. This company should do better work before issuing great books like this."
1,Illiterate,"DO NOT buy this copy of The Day of the Locust. I was shocked at the poor quality, as though it had been translated from another language. It is riddled with typos, and sometimes they even misspell the main character's names. The formatting is awful and the type is very very small. The book is also strangely large for a novel; this is not a professional print job. I can't believe I even paid money for this print, it managed to make reading un-enjoyable. Amazon, don't you do quality control? Jeez...."
4,Enlive from Ross is good value and good vendor,"Prompt delivery with no problems. Have purchased from this vendor before, and will purchase again."
4,This is DANG good,"Carlonie Cobb's voice is absolutely awesome, but she comes across as still being a real person. Her lyrics remind me of those by Jill Phillips-- real words of love for Jesus and a real connection to the truth of humanity. The song about Hosea is one of the best songs I have heard in years. If I can ever find another Caroline Cobb CD, I will buy that son of a gun in a heartbeat."
5,This album was an under appreciated masterpiece,"Released when the rock world was going back to the basics with the inital punk purge, Mental Notes by Split Enz was overlooked. This album was a little too smart, a little too musically sophisticated for the time. It was beautiful, sad, odd, offbeat, heartfelt music that Spilt Enz was not able to duplicate or build upon in their later recordings."
5,Enchanting,"George Abdo is one of the most fantastic musicians for belly dance. All the tracks are enchantable and emotionfull. I'm a belly dance performer and had the contact with this album since the beginning of my classes. When I start to listening to it, I cannot stop dancing. You just have to let your body flow..."
1,Just a semi-nice spiral notebook -- waste of money,"The description makes it sound as if the ""author"" gives you ideas on topics to write about, but all this product is is a spiral notebook with kiddie pictures and the occasional (not even on every page!) blurb. Save your money, buy a nice spiral notebook from the drugstore. The Toddler Journal by Christine Harris took a lot more work and is money better spent. I'm disappointed and am returning the Mommy Journal."
5,simple but effective,"This is a cute but simple journal with blank spaces for dates and entries. I suppose that you could always just use a plain journal, but it is really adorable with drawings and sweet quotes and it serves it's purpose. I think a little more space per entry would have been helpful. Overall, a great buy and something that I know my daughter will appreciate when she's older."
5,Awesome mommy journal,This is an awesome journal. I have two kids (almost 2 and newborn) and don't have as much time to write long entries as frequently as i did with my first child. I still wanted him to have a journal and this is perfect. This journal has cute illustrations and allows three entries per page. It is well made and an added bonus is that a portion of the profits are donated to a foundation to care for neglected and abused children. I love journaling for my children. You forget many of the little things and this a great way to preserve those beautiful memories. Happy journaling!!
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would have guided letters for you to write to your child on different topics, but its not. its basically 3-5 blank spaces for letters per page. I returned it."
3,not what i expected,"I thought there would be a little more to this journal than what I got. It's okay, it doesn't have a lot of space which I understand is the idea behind the book but I find that I need a little more structure and space for my entries."
5,LOVE THIS,"I absolutely love this book. I've got little notes jotted down in my daughter's baby book, a 1st year calendar and on facebook of all the adorable things I want to remember. Now I just have to go back and compile them all into this book. It's the perfect amount of space for a quick anecdote of the amazing moments that you think you'll never forget but inevitably do... My only complaint is that I didn't have this book before I had my daughter!"
1,The Vanishing,If you are thinking of buying this because you liked the movie so much...don't bother. I didn't like it at all.
5,Great Traveling Music,"Many songs on this album will make you want to drive down the highway with the music turned up loud! Neanderthal and Flying Surfers are interesting, artistic pieces that show Danny Click's ability to paint pictures with music. The pace of the album is balanced with Blues Are Too Good For You. Along with his album, Forty Miles, this collection continues to build a showcase of this artist's talent and originality."
4,I really liked it,"Ok, so have never seen any of the Terminator movies, so that may make my review irrelevant to some, but I really liked this Season. I am pretty sad there is not a Season 3 because I wan't to know what happens next, but I think if you saw Season 1 and liked it then you are going to like Season 2. I do think you need to watch Season 1 first though, because there is a TON of back story. Anyways, it was good! Thumbs up from me. (Only 4 stars not five because the show didn't blow my socks off, but I did think it was really good)"
5,wish there was more seasons,"hubby has both seasons, had to send this one back because i thought there was more seasons of it but there arent...was a smooth transaction even to send it back was easy..would buy from again"
4,I am a fan of Terminator movies and series,I really like it I am a fan of Terminator Movies I was 10 when T 1 came out and my wife and I really enjoy watching this TV series. We loved season 1 and Season 2 is even better. I am in a way sad that they did not continue but with the turn that T 4 took and the possibility of doing a new series in the future as well as T 5 and T 6 on the way I think that I am going to see plenty of Terminators in the future. Plus this serie had a time limit as it was between T 2 and T 3 so it could not be too long. In any case I enjoy the special effects and the characters and the way they interacts as well as the new characters that were not in the original. They definitely did a great job and I am very happy to have bought this series. We own both seasons.
3,Menue issues,"Just finished watching the first disc of the Blu Ray version and also put in the second disc.NO DISC MENU? What the heck... The episodes just start. I hit the disc menu button and it brings up a menu for the first episode on the disc, that's it. I cannot skip to a different episode easily, so if I don't have time to watch all 4-5 episodes on a disc I am hosed when the next night I want to pick up where I left off.I have an LG BD390 and the firm ware is up to date, so I doubt it is my player.This really detracts from the utility of having this on Blu Ray, and is VERY annoying.The story is good, crappy execution of the product."
2,Mediocre at best,"I thought the first season was decent so I turned into the second with high hopes but the show never really got beyond mediocre the second year which is ashame. Good cast but fair writing make this on par with the third season of Heroes. If you like Sci Fi and good writing, you might be smart to head in another direction than this show."
2,ANOTHER CANCELLED SERIES,I DIDN'T CARE TOO MUCH FOR THIS SERIES BUT I PURCHASED THIS DVD SET FOR A FRIEND WHO JUST ENJOY WATCHING THIS SCI-FI DUD!
1,stupid crap!,"Wow! How many john conners do you need 5? 2 or 3 sarah's? different movies, different series give me a freaking brake trash that stupid crap!!! They should get the Blade the series back!!!"
4,Season 1 is better,"In this 2nd season, we are introduced to some new characters. There is a machine posing as a technology corp. CEO. Zeiracorp is looking for the machine called the Turk. This ""woman"" that's in charge of the company is apparently part of the future resistance, and is an ally. John also meets a girl named Riley. He spends more and more time with her, in doing so he alienates Cameron and Sarah. The story does progress a little bit in this season, but not as much as I would have liked. The issue I have with this season is the ending. Season 2 ends at a very interesting and critical event. I hope they decide to continue this show. This season also seemed to drag a little bit at times. Riley was focused on too much I think. A character like her wasn't really all that important to the main story. She did serve an important purpose, but she wasn't worth spending the time that they did on her. Overall I really enjoyed season 2. I think fans of the 1st season will probably agree."
5,All these Sara Conner's Cronicles series are worth it . .,"As a Terminator trilogy fan, I can say without reservation that, although this series will not live to be a legend like the Terminator trilogy, after all it is TV, the plot, characters, and directing are first rate.I measure the quality of a flick by whether I return to watch it again and again. I was and am still surprised to find myself returning to my Video Purchases page to watch this bunch crunch, burn, electrocute, and incinerate the bad buys.[...]"
3,Whats going on with the subs?????,"I think this series is great, the only complain about the blu-ray release is that they didnt include the spanish subs, whats going on warner Bros???, i mean, danish subs, finnish subs???? The same thing happened with Smallville Season 8, and with Everwood Season 2 on DVD!! Not even the DVD release came with spanish subs. I guess they dont care about it that much, but they should, i mean, its an multinational network isnt it?? [...] !!! Im gonna have to buy the DVDs and forget about getting the blu-ray, since the DVD has all the subtitles, you people think we are too cheap to buy blu-ray??"
5,A SERIES TO GOOD TO BE ON FOX!,"A cable network should pick this show up, it's to good for network tv where the adverage viewer has no clue what this show has in store. If you like good writing, plots, stories, characters, action and suspence.Then this series is for you, order it today to save Season 3!"
5,Still a big fan !!!,"Loved season 1 in every way, but season 2 had its boring points.Started strong, went downhill in the middle and finished with a bang !!BRING ON SEASON 3 !!!!!"
5,Awesome!,"Love this series! I only wish that there was more to watch! I highly recommend watching it, and I hope eventually there are more made or a movie is released."
3,decent,"I'd say in a word, fair. Worth seeing, yet maybe not enough to pay 'good money' for. Buy it if its a good deal."
3,Not so much...,After watching season 1 I had high hopes but season 2 was less than stellar. It seemed the writers knew they were doomed so they just starting grasping for stories. I was quite disappointed.
4,Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles 2nd,"I was a big fan of the Sarah Connor Chronicles, both seasons 1 & 2, however, with the 2nd season, some story-lines left me a bit cold. I will say, as I watched the show I felt disappointed occasionally, but as things started to come together by the end of the season I liked it much more. There were a few ""a-ha"" moments that I enjoyed.A warning -- the 2nd season leaves with a cliff hanger that has not been resolved as of this review.I wish the showed had been allowed to continue. The ratings did drop some because of some of those erratic episodes, but I was very disappointed it wasn't renewed."
1,This episode made no sense no real point to the story,"This show started really good but now its like they are all filers or stupid.This episode made no sense no real point to the story.Cameron is useless in most episode now. She is the only reason i like the show to begin with. The other character aren't as interesting has a T101 female terminatorWhy am i paying money for this.If they don't watch out they will get canceled.kyle xy is getting canceled but this show is not WTF.I don't get it, is it me or is it really getting boring and pointless to watch this show recently. I really want this show to be great it has so much potential. But lets face it Fox is not what it used to be.How many American idol have we gone through yet?.........manyI have all the terminator episode but i will stop i work so i don't get to see it on TV.But at least hero is still good and supernatural also"
4,FOX [shakes fist],"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was a great show. If you haven't seen it and enjoy well-written, engaging science fiction, do yourself a favor and check it out.On another note, FOX is the reason I literally do not watch FOX. They have aborted more promising material that most networks see in a decade. I'll purchase DVDs of their series after they've been renewed (it's how I caught this show, Dollhouse, and Fringe), but I utterly refuse to watch them while they're being broadcast."
3,Liars Marathon = Suspense?,The second season is good entertainment for the money. I just found at some point in the series it gets bogged down with all of the principle characters becoming chronic liars to the other characters to the point of losing any empathy for any of the characters. The show becomes a circular quagmire of deceptive lying which is overused by the producers in order to produce the primary suspense in the series.
3,Back to mediocrity,"The show was getting good starting from the 5th episode of the first season to the beginning of season 2, but as season 2 went on the episodes were too similar. We were no longer getting flashbacks and further information on the characters back story, and one of the key relationships (John and Cameron) was drastically diminished this season. Overall, I felt like this season was a step backward for the series, and I'm not that upset with it's cancellation. Although I will say that the finale could have set up some interesting scenarios for a third season."
3,This one was unpleasant to watch,"This one was unpleasant to watch, a depressing comedown from season one, and would've gotten even worse had there been a third season. Summer Glau had the best of both seasons and by the end of this one probably had no idea where her role was headed.I don't remember much about the extras- they'd be the best reason to watch this one."
5,"""Darn"" them for canceling this series, it's great","Season two was even better than season one. The characters become more filled out and you actually begin to care about them. This season starts out strong and gets better and better. I was becoming emotionally invested in this tale and the idiots at Fox cancelled it. As you may have guessed, ""Darn"" is not the word I would like to use.As to the Today is the Day episode; Queeg? as the captain? Did you not read the Caine Mutiny? Talk aout foreshadowing .."
4,Really Good,"This series grows on you, the second half is where it starts to pick up speed and the last four episodes are outstanding, the ending is absolutely perfect and quite unexpected, will leave you amazed at its originality.Acting is very natural, Garret Dillahunt is charismatic as John Henry, all actors are very good, a great team.Third Season, if they don't cancel the show promises to be brilliant, if they do, the ending of the second Season will be remembered as one of the best ever done."
4,This Show Just Got Better And Better...,Some shows take time to get in a groove. By the last 4 or 5 episodes of season 2 TSCC was my favorite show on TV!I thought the writers did a great job of setting things up from episode to episode. The tone was dark and appropriately gritty (hell it was nuanced even).I've heared that TSCC has been canceled. I can only hope that it ain't so!
4,Terminator Fans!,"If you're a fan of the Terminator series, this is for you! This being the second season of this show, it's a must have for fans. It picks up right where season 1 left off, and doesn't disappoint. Both seasons take place between T2 and T3. Enjoy."
4,DVD box sets.,"this was a box set,when i received it the case was broken.I had to return it for another one.This has happen more than once.Amazon needs to package these fragile items better.The one i received was in a bubble pack envelope.Put it in a box with some kind of packing material in it."
3,Sarah Connor Chronicles season 2,"The second season was ok. It wasn't as good as the first season, so i see why the show was cancelled. Having said that, though, towards the end of the season the plot was starting to progress and get really interesting, so it's a shame that there can be no closure for the millions of viewers that watched the show when it aired on television.The characters are really good, the twists are predictable, but still worthy of the show, and the special effects are pretty good for t.v.All in all, it's definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the show."
5,A great series!,"A great series, killed by the networks.It will live on in the DVD and the fans will get their money's worth on this set."
5,Great television,"The opening is unforgettable, one of the great episodes. Music, cinematography, acting, and superb writing."
1,I FEEL CHEATED - IN FACT I'VE BEEN CHEATED!!!!!!!,"I ordered this book to use with my daughter that has Autism. Since there was 'no image' and it was 'no longer in print' (as stated on the Amazon.com site), I went ahead to order. I just received the book and not only is it 60pages of probably photocopied material, there is nothing to show that it's worth the $209.99 I paid for it.I wish Amazon will review some of their Sellers more critically.I am sending it back to Amazon right away!!!!!! BTW in it's original package."
2,Foghorn Leghorn - Cartoon Classics.,"This tape consists of very old cartoons that are in the public domain. If you're looking for Foghorn Leghorn cartoons, look elsewhere. This tape contains one mediocre Foghorn Leghorn cartoon (Crowing Pain), and three other non-Foghorn Leghorn cartoons (I Want To Be A Sailor, All's Fair At The Fair, and An Elephant Never Forgets)."
5,The Title Says It All,This book is thoroughly researched and beautifully written. Anyone with an interest in baseball history or American history will find a lot to like.
1,5 star,"I love the platters and has not found a cd in my town, thus I was glad to be able to get it on the internet"
1,I played for Ringling Brothers,"I played for Ringling Brothers several times. I don't know who these guys are, but I know the Ringling band I played for never sounded like this. This is not good at all."
2,Old Timey Circus Band For Rael,Sounds like a second rate circus band. Not very impressive but useful if the repertoire appeals to the buyer.
2,A shoddy and disappointing compilation at best.,"I waited a long time for a compilation of the Royal Guardsmen's work and, boy, was this a disappointment! All of the tracks from the Snoopy and His Friends LP are muddy sounding. Return of the Red Baron has an entire channel missing which cuts out all of the sound effects and the intro is chopped off. Snoopy for President has two words edited out of the opening line, making it sound like a record that skipped while it was playing! Also, the compilation is not exactly perfect either, as lame covers of sixties classics like I'm A Man (which the Guardsmen cannot do justice to) and So You Want to Be a Rock and Roll Star (which they do as an instrumental! ) are included over tracks like So Right (to be in love) and It Kinda Looks Like Christmas. Someone needs to do another compilation like this and make some improvements."
1,Look Elsewhere,"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!! It is missing key sound effects and intro on ""Return of the Red Baron"" and even some on ""Snoopy vs. Red Baron."" The people who put this together were only interested in collecting your money and not checking to see if they got it right."
5,It was great!,I read the other reviews and I think they are just nitpicking. Just because they think The Royal Gaurdsmen don't sound like they use to is no reason to critisize. Maybe they don't really remember how they sound. I had never heard the song Snoopy for President before I bought the CD. I did not notice any skiping in the first line. I had an 8-track player of my GreatGrandmother's with an 8-track that had Snoopy vs. The Red Baron on it which is why I bought the CD. Overall it is one of my favorite CDs.
2,Unorganized and bland,"I was very disappointed in this recording, which includes the songs of the Royal Guardsman seemingly thrown together at random. Also, the recording lacked the story that was so much a part of Snoopy vs. The Red Baron. In the original album, there was a story to high command's search for a hero that would rid the skies of the Red Baron that led into Snoopy vs. The Red Baron. This was followed by the story of how the Red Baron was shot down and everyone wondered if he was dead, followed by the song Return of the Red Baron. This led into the story of the break down of the Christmas Truths talks and then into the song Snoopy's Christmas. Down Behind the Lines is a natural follow up to Snoopy's Christmas, followed by the Littlest Astronaught and Snoopy for President. Without this structure and story, the recording looses its appeal. All of the songs referring to Snoopy should come first, followed by the rest. A great disappointment."
2,I bought this album for one song.,"I bought this album for ""Snoopy's Christmas."" I could have saved my money if I just downloaded this one song."
2,It's not what I remembered,I just finished reviewing the album of what I thought to be Snoopy Christmas. The one I remembered form 30 + years ago was a red album cover with snoopy flying a plane and the song Christmas Candy song by a woman. I am guessing it was by the Royal Guardsman by now I am thinging it might not be. I ma dissapointed that I don't remember the guardsman to be as good as I remembered so long ago.
4,A Needed Tool for the Bible Scholar,"This book makes the study of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles much easier, since it shows the parallel passages next to each other on the same page. The pages are conveniently divided into 2 larger columns, one for the Judah, one for Israel. This method takes much of the confusion out of trying to figure out what is going on where and when, since the ""overlaps"" are shown side-by-side. I think such a harmony in essential to have available to the Christian community. I myself teach Sunday School and have found it indispensible. My only objection to this particular harmony is that Mr. Crockett has seen fit to rearrange the chronology in places (rather than just going straight through Samuel and Kings, incorporating Chronicles where it overlaps). His way of doing it has made it difficult for those without harmonies to follow what it going on."
5,History made clear..,Many people do not even study these books and therefore do not understand the history within them. Without understanding history they can't truly understand prophecy. This book makes that essential study much easier. [...]...
1,check the price,I ordered this book for an unbelievable price then they couldn't deliver. I guess it was too good to be true.
2,"Not the soundtrack, more like an album.","Don't buy this in hopes that it is the soundtrack you remember listening to while playing the game. While listening to this ""Game CD"" I BARELY heard anything that RESEMBLED what I remember to be key music in the game. Still it was a nice idea to have this soundtrack made, however it is not the original music the sega game tracked. Your best best bet if you liked the music is to go to the jukebox in the menu option of the game and burn that on a CD. And be sure to label that the CD box the soundtrack as not to confuse others."
2,The Horrible Voice of Howard Drossin,"The clay faced musician, Howard Drossin, whose most notable projects include his intense work on video game soundtracks. He created the whole album himself, played every instrument and sang his heart out to deliver this heavy hitting CD of epic proportion. It perfectly captures the music from the SEGA classic, which coincidentally was also created by Mr. Drossin. This picture perfectly chapters the stoned vocals and lethal perceptions of Howard Possard. The album features post apocalyptic grudge sequence and deep rooted blues and jazz sequence, followed by a riveting drum sequence which will knock those spokes off. The best track is the prolific ""Fred MY Disease."" It features intensive drum belted accompanied by hilthrong vocals of the southern musician. The prosthetic chapter conveys sweat and bullocks with the redundant drum beat and symphonious cacophony of organs and horns."
3,La Batelera,"En realidad yo estoy solo interesado en la canción llamada ""La Batelera"", pero antes de comprar el disco, me gustaría saber si es la misma que ando buscando, y si existe algún otro disco o cantante que interprete esta canción."
5,Desert Island Disc,"I've listened to a LOT of albums, spanning most of the major popular genres, and this is in my top ten, period. I've listened to it dozens of times and never seem to tire of it. The other reviews you read are all true -- Kottke's playing is more than masterful -- it's transcendent.It's been said before that the best way to hear bluegrass music (and this might well fit the genre of ""Newgrass"") is ""live"" outside the studio. While Kottke's early studio albums are all great, this is the very best he's done, because the spirit of the music comes alive. I can't imagine anyone from the western hemisphere coming to this from any musical preference and not enjoying it.Want more joy in your life? -- Listen to this record. You have to hear it for yourself."
5,Solo Guitar Effort,"i can't review this record because i haven't heard it yet. looks o.k.? but i'm strange. to me Baroque is horse & buggy. yeah, i'll take a chance on it?"
1,Boring,"I was disappointed in this recording. A lot of it sounds like just a cacophony of finger exercises. True, he does play fast--on and on--boring."
5,I am so glad to find this record again.,"In my transient years, I lost this album. It was an LP. It was my favorite of my entire Leo kottke collection. It has Eggtooth on it as well as the better versions of songs that were repeated later. Don't pass this one up, it is sure to please. It was out of print (unavailable) for many years. Thank God for technology. Did you know that June Bug was played on a classical (nylon string) guitar? PS Leo, thanks for the autograph at Mishuwaka inn."
5,Brilliant Film Noir,"This film, though over 50 years old, is incredibly modern. It is the film that so many crime thrillers of the past 20 or so years have copied shamelessly. And you can't blame Tarantino and the rest for it-- this film is simply terrific."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An engaging heist movie with a heck of an ending, The Killing is notable not just because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick but because it's a solid piece of filmmaking that's sure to entertain."
5,Kubrick's film noir groundbreaker.,"""The Killing"" is a stunning piece of film noir. What's even more stunning is that this movieis only Kubrick's third major release! It features an excellent cast(Tim Carey is awesome as the too-cool killer for hire). Claustrophobic camerawork, and a shocking ending make this movie a must-see for Kubrick fans, as well as crime fans. Chances are, if you're watching a movie about a robbery gone awry, the ideas were derived from ""The Killing."" NOTE: excellent script by Jim Thompson."
5,"Highly recommended, a classic.",This is a masterpiece. The parallel narration is difficult to follow at times but still excellent overall. The beginning of Kubrick's amazing career.
4,Lenny Bruce makes a cameo trivia,"Cogent comments by all. Just another piece of visual ephemera: When Sterling Hayden emerges from the shop with his bargain used luggage in the last reel, we see that next door is a strip club; it's acts currently emceed by Dirty Lenny. Excellent young directors' film."
4,In the mood for noir?,This film just took me back to the '50s. Characters are great. Story is great. Buy it.
3,"Good, but no ""Asphalt Jungle""","Stanley Kubrick obviously modeled ""The Killing"" on ""Asphalt Jungle."" He made a nice attempt, but stick with the original. Kubrick gets first-class performances from Sterling Hayden. Elisha Cook Jr. (eternal fall guy) and especially Marie Windsor, whose cynical glamor-girl housewife character just about carries the film. But Kubrick annoyingly fritters away valuable time and attention by flitting back and forth over the same time and turf from the perspective of different characters. Contrast this self-indulgence with the taut, spare, nothing-wasted direction of ""Asphalt Jungle."" He introduces a nice touch--a lady with a little dog that you know will have some big, unforeseen impact--but that's a Hitchcock trademark, not a Huston signature. Worth watching, but ""Asphalt Jungle"" is still the undisputed champ of heist films."
3,Kubrick Owes An Apology to John Huston!,"I am astounded at the extravagant praise that this movie receives. Yes, it WAS directed by Stanley Kubrick. But clearly, at this point in his career, Mr. Kubrick was not exactly a master of his craft. The voice-over narrative is really distracting,irritating and corny, even for those days. Also what really gets me is this movie a clear rip-off of the outstanding noir film, The Asphalt Jungle, which was made eight years earlier and also featured Sterling Hayden. Now THAT was (and still is) a great crime movie, the progenitor of all ""caper"" films and a movie very sadly ignored by most film buffs, especially the younger generation. Stanley Kubrick should have taken all the money he made from ""The Killing"" and sent it to John Huston, with a note of apology. Forget ""The Killing."" Buy ""The Asphalt Jungle."" You won't be sorry."
4,a good racehorse movie.that doesnt happen much,"this is one of those old,slow 50s movies.the lighting is poor in places.these guys are going to rob a horse track.thier idea is basicly a number of distractions and a clean getaway.the kids wont like all the drama and thriller stuff.stanley kubrik directs so you know its good.i think its a very good movie!"
5,ununderstandable saving,"Truly one can hardly understand how a so perfectly planned robbery can fail owing to a second hand suitcase with so feeble locks. These isn't the moment to economize a few dollars! Also these dog in the airport... What can one say after that? A truly pity. One wish for once to see winning the bad guy, but..."
3,"Good Story, A Little Dated",Watched this primarily because it was directed by Kubrick. A nice taut story-line which seems a bit stiff and dated now. Still enjoyable though.
1,A complete Disappointment,"I bought this DVD because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick,but it was obvious a film in his earliest stage of development.The movie is narrated like a Walter Winchell crime documentary or in the style of the old Dragnet program.The only thing good that probably came out of this film was Mr Kubrick remembered Sterling Hayden,and used him later in one of his terrific films Dr Strangelove.A very laughable old film about a racetrack robbery.I don't recommend."
5,Sterling Hayden at his finest,"This is a great movie. Its in black and white and it is classic noir. Sterling Hayden is the classic example of a movie STAR of that time. He is big, tall as a tree, handsome and like a piece of granite. The guy is just a mans man and in this movie he is a criminals criminal. He leads a cast of characters in a robbery of a horse race track. The movie goes thru the set up and the actual recruitment of the thugs and the envolvement of their broads. Ex professional wrestling legend and promoter Kola Kwiriani makes an appearance and is involved in a great brawl against about 20 cops and he kicks their butts. Hayden is the guy that is too dumb to do the right thing and too smart to not try to plan the wrong thing, the perfect crime. He brings along his mousey girlfriend who he is going to take away after the ""last big score"".Just love this movie. Its a keeper and a legendary film noir movie. Oh and also... Stanley Kubrick is the director!!!"
4,Great Noir!,"I bought this movie because Vince Edwards was in it, and I'm a huge Vince Edwards fan. He has a very small part, but the movie is interesting and some of the dialogue is cutting edge for it's time. It has some surprise twists and turns. Fans of film noir will love it!"
4,Pulp-It-Up,"Stanley Kubrick sure had a dark vision, a Noir vision. The ex-cons crawling over Sterling Hayden's sting are salivating over the prospect of becoming rich. Marie Winsor is the Noir bad girl married to the wimpy cashier Elisha Cook. If Cook is in the film, it's going to be good. He always played the young punks in old Bogart films like the Maltese Falcon.The robbery is complicated. Guarded by a phalanx of coppers, the racetrack cash will be tough to crack. A hip-cat sharpshooter is engaged in order to distract the police. He's going to shoot the best horse in Race 7 on the down stretch as the robbery goes in gear. Sure, this is Hayden's last caper before he settles down with his girl. We know it's not going to work, but the character acting, Colleen Gray, Vince Edwards, the entire cast, pulps-it-up into a satisfying crescendo. Sure, crime doesn't pay in a 50's Noir, but this film is so influential, a hundred caper movies has it spawned."
5,A Luminous Biography,This biography of woman haiku master Chiyo-ni is interwovenwith beautiful translations of her haiku as well as intelligent background material on the form itself. A must-have.
4,happy bellydancer!,"I have had this album on tape for many years, and although now we tend to use more modern music,every now and then we need something more traditional, but still pleasing to a western ear.This album is one of my favourites,and perfect for us more traditional bellydancers!"
4,Easy to move to!,"I downloaded this as an MP3 file. I really like this music! I use them for my exercise routines. The songs are fairly short and most of them are instrumental.I bought the belly dancing videos with Neena and Veena. I pick out specific movements that I want to practice. After my workout, I have fun mastering the individual movements using this music.I have wanted to learn how to bellydance since I was very young. This music makes it easy and fun to dance. Great for making up your own routines!"
3,Palm stylus MultiPack,These were not what I expected based on the description. I kept them but they were not what I wanted.
4,Briliant Book.,"An absolutely brilliant book,it covers every move made by the two oppossing armies. The mistakes that led to the defeat of the volunteer Union army.And it is told like gripping novell placed in the most gallant time."
4,Good Account of the War's First Major Battle,"Davis has written an interesting read on the Civil War's first major battle: the narrative is interesting without being overly simplistic, the criticisms and praises are balanced for North and South, and the maps are okay (would have liked to have seen more and enlarged).While the book's approximately 270 pages are small by Civil War standards (of course, other battles were larger and had more political developments and changes in leadership as opposed to the time of 1st Bull Run), Davis does a good job of weaving the political climate and military strategy in with the battle descriptions. I particularly enjoyed reading in the book's last chapter summarizing what happened to the battle's main participants after Bull Run.All in all, a good and recommended read as the definitive account of the war's first major battle."
5,"BEAUTIFUL, great content, hard to find with all prints well attached","One of the nicest books in Russian art that I have ever owned. Absolutely STUNNING. The only real problem with this book when found today is that basically all the art prints are seperate sheets attached to the pages. with age and reading wear, these can loosen and become separated from the book. Or, just as bad, some may have been purposely taken from books as they are all suitable for framing. One needs to make sure that every print is with the book when buying it now as it is 45 yrs old as of 2009"
5,FOX...an American Company Screwing Americans,"If it were not for the Simpsons,(which appeared to be on a rebound last season)I wouldn't even give FOX the time of day.Here we have a great show like Futurama,that they never gave a fair shot,pre-empted ad-infintum,and now we're bludgeoned with garbage like (insert titile of reality show you hate the most here.)Thankfully, they've gotten these DVD sets out more quickly than the Simpsons. Though Europe had Season 4 of Futurama quite sometime ago (way to screw the Americans over,FOX!!)Okay,okay..I'll stop being grumpy now..because I WAS quite elated to see this in my recommendations!:D:D There's really not much I can say that wasn't covered in the Amazon review. You probably already know you like it,so whaddaya waitin' for? (how many other shows could actually get away with several visualizations of sh**ting a brick?) Stop reading. Buy (or pre-order) now."
5,fox sucks!!,"I love Futurama. Out of any tv shows in history this one goes right at the top with simspons and family guy. so why must it get cancelled and replaced with such retarded reality tv series. i praise cartoon network for giving one of the best shows of all time another chance. i say we destroy fox, and rid ourselves of american idol forever. oh and buy the dvd, no matter what you are into you'll love these classics."
3,weakest season,"i understand that most people reading this would be on the fence about the show so i won't take long. -- This volume lacks the consistency of 2&3. I suspect it is due to the shoddy treatment by Fox (leading to random time slots and NFL games preventing the show from airing for weeks at a time). Still, by the end of the first disc in vol 4 my girlfriend half-jokingly suggested we throw it up on e-bay. I was equally disappointed as I realized many of the lackluster episodes i do remember seeing on TV were in this volume -- kipf gets knocked up, bender shouldn't be allowed on television, the why of fry (do we need another episode that rehashes fry's journey thru time? apprantly!).That being said -- if you like the show there are enough episodes here to warrent purchasing the set. But get vol's 2 & 3 first.EDITED: misspelled ""shoddy"""
1,"Package design is great, but no Blu-Ray is failure.","I don't know what to think about this. I own the all of the original versions of volumes 1-4 (plus the first 2 movies) on DVD. I don't understand why the last two movies are available on blu-ray as are season 5 & 6 and yet, they spring for this package redesign (which is gorgeous and great) but *no* high-def transfer??Way to hold out on the fans, Fox. It'd would be tempting, but i'll pass on this double-dip (or is it triple at this point?) tactic until the Volumes are re-released in high-def blu-ray.5 stars for cohesive design. 0 stars for DVD."
5,I really hoped that this show would still be going,"This show is SO funny. Futurama is from the creator of the Simpsons, Matt Groening. This show is far better than the Simpsons and has a very accruate view on the far future. In my opinion, this is the second best season of Futurama. If you don't have any of the Futurama box sets, then watch it on Adult Swim (Adult Swim is on Cartoon Network and it is recommended for people 14 and older) at 11:30 pm (thats for all U.S. timezones) on Monday- Thursday and Saturday."
4,"Futurama is great, commentaries lack John DiMaggio!","The voice of John DiMaggio (Bender) is not on many of the audio commentaries. Not sure why because Billy West is there and so is David X. Cohen. It's a shame. That was the funnest part of owning the first few seasons, Bender was always on the commentaries. Buyer beware."
4,"Awesome show, but Amazon is not the best deal","Best Buy was expensive, so I figured online would be cheaper. Amazon has it for $5 less with free shipping, so I order it. Gets here pretty quickly. But, go figure, when I'm at Wal Mart the next time, I see the same thing is ten bucks less than the Amazon price!!!"
3,good,The purchase went well. The book was in great shape and it arrived promptly. I look forward to giving it as a gift.thank you.
5,excellent inspiring,has the ability like his father to give us the strenght we need to push on in diffucult times thanks
1,SmartMedia never works,"You cannot use a smartmedia card which has been previously used in some other device. You cannot transfer songs to the smartmedia card, it keeps crashing all the time.Basically you will never get to use a smartmedia card with this product although you can continue to use the in-built memory"
1,Enormously cumbersome software package,"The player is small, cool looking and pretty easy to use.The included software, however, is a *NIGHTMARE*. And to add insult to injury, the driver disables recognition of the device by Windows Explorer so you cannot use that simple interface to manage songs on the player - you *have* to use their software (or MusicMatch Jukebox if you download another driver).I ended up returning the player. A shame, because the player itself really is quite nice. I spend too much time copying and deleting songs to and from the player to put up with the unnecessary hassle though....."
1,i wish i could give it zero stars,"i have never ever had so much trouble with an electronic item in my life. i was never able to get music from my music manager to my mp3 player, though i followed the instructions to the letter (the message boxes that should have popped up to take me to the next function never did). i called the company for tech support and got a voice mail; i called customer service and got a voice mail; i called and didn't choose anything and got a voice mail. when i e-mailed tech support, i got an auto-response which seemed very helpful, but in the end, got me nowhere. they obviously do not wish to be on hand to help customers, so i am returning my mp3 player today for a full refund. i highly discouraging purchasing anything from this manufacturer."
1,disappointed...,"the good thing is that it is small and lightweight, but sometimes the software doesn't work on my computer and I always have to restart it. the 2 memory cards i bought for it also doesn't work even though it is the right type thats suppose to be used. i'm thinking about getting a different mp3 player because i get to frustrated with iRock."
3,"pretty chintzy, but it works",The software is awful. Even with third party software I had trouble downloading files until I tried editing the ID3 tags. If I remove the album art from the tag it seems to work.
5,quite a story,"i very much enjoyed this story - my first by this author. well-defined characters, all easy to like despite human flaws and shortcomings."
4,Pretty good,"I wish the author realizes not everything must be put in the form of an analogy! Apart from that the book is a good review of how to go about a research paper, giving valuable advice on how to avoid pitfalls. As somebody mentioned, the Computer Prompts really are very basic."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this was going to be the greatest. But I was disappointed because of the adjustable frame. On the bottom of the frame it's difficult to see in the picture, but their are two thumb screws to adjust the bracket up and down so it lay flat on the bed. If you have a foot board which I do most bed do you need to reach way down between foot board and mattress to get at these screws, and the sheets and blankets are in the way. Very cumbersome this way I take it out and put it back under at night thats how difficult these screws are and caregivers have difficult time need to explain how it works it's hassle. BUT otherwise! It holds the sheets/blankets well and size is good it's made well but this was very disappointing. The white cheaper one which I had was easier to use but not as well made as this one."
5,Damn fine boot,"Never owned a pair of Tim's before. Took them out for an all day hike and WOW! Really resistant to water, comfortable, and are durable. look forward to owning these for a few years."
1,Awful text errors. Avoid this edition!,"Get any other edition at all of Iqbal's critically important work. This 2009 production from the ridiculously named ""Dodo Press"" suffers from terrible textual problems presumably resulting from 1) translation of one electronic text format to another and 2) no proofreading! For example, on the bottom of page 2, Qur'an is rendered ""Qur'n"" --presumably the source text had a diacritic character for the long a, but the text has been corrupted. Qur'n continues, page after page, and the problem gets worse as longer names of people, titles of books, and quoted passages come in from Arabic, Persian, and Urdu."
5,"Amazing product, esp if you have muscle problems","I recently had a severe calf strain from sports, and the muscles in my injured leg were very tight. Even a week after the injury, i could barely walk with crutches - I would get muscle spasms and muscle twitches at almost every step. On the 8th night, i used some of this salt in a bucket with hot water, and put my leg in there for about 20 mins. Next morning I woke up - and all of a sudden now i could walk without spasms and twitches. The night before, my muscles seemed to be locking up at smallest movement - now they felt softer than the muscles in my unhurt leg! This stuff is seriously amazing - and yes, it really does relax your muscles! I am planning to use this regularly going forward, because i believe it can really accelerate my recovery over the next few weeks. It makes the skin much softer too - i noticed that after several nights' use, the skin of my injured calf feels a lot smoother than my other leg! Smells great, and thank you Ahava!"
5,You've got to be kidding,"It's absolutely nuts that this title is not available today on CD. Whoever owns the rights - please either reissue or sell the rights to a company that will reissue. Anyone who grew up in the 70's, 80's knows this title and what a wonderfully unique collection of songs it is. If you love NGDB - you have to own this along with ""...Circle...."""
1,Did not work,This dvd was a dud - it did not work at all. I was not sure how to get a replacement for it.
2,for whom the bell tolls movie,too much minutiae....the intent from the outset is to blow up a bridge and it finally happens as the movie ends...the actual event is drawn out to make it exciting and it seems phony....great actors though...
5,Great gift,I bought the move for my father. He really enjoyed this classic movie and the price was right. Definitely great!
4,Gary Cooper plays a good Hemingway Hero!,"A very young Cooper stared with Helen Hayes in "" A Farewell to Arms"". In this film he does even better! Ingrid Bergman was a very young girl and captures the war torn raped Spanish girl so well. This is the screen version of a novel that is a Nobel recognized masterpiece with two of Hollywood's all time stars in lead roles. It is what they mean by a ""Classic Film"". How I know a classic tragedy is that I dread and hope at the same time when I play it!"
3,this mediocre adaptation DEMANDS to be seen for the great performance by katina paxinou,"literary adaptations can be quite overblown and this is no exception. gary cooper and ingrid bergman (looking stunning) give performances which neither could have been very proud of: more wooden than pinocchio. but the supporting parts are excellent, notably akim tamiroff, and more notably katina paxinou, the legendary greek stage actress who herein gives one of the finest performances ever seen on screen. paxinou made only a handful of other motion pictures, and none so memorable as this, but for this alone she deserves to be called one of the greatest of film actresses. apart from that the movie is way too long and unimpressive."
1,Not comfortable to wear,"First, the color of the stones is lighter than is pictured. I realize it is hard to capture color in a picture, but the ring I received has stones that are light purple to almost a pink color. For the price of the ring I can deal with that though, I mean, what can you expect for $29? The worst part is that it's just hard to wear because it's not comfortable. It would have been better with five stones instead of seven because the two outer stones rub against your other fingers and it gets annoying fast. I'll be returning this ring and will try something else."
2,"Good Performances but Poor Script Sinks ""Training Day""","After hearing so many good things about this movie, I was greatly disappointed. Denzel gives a great performance, but I would hardly call it Oscar-worthy. Actually, it's hard to say what an Oscar worthy performance is anymore,since so many of the awards are given for political reasons and are based less and less on artistic merit. It was the same with Al Pacino and his award for the very trite ""Scent of a Woman"" Ugh. The performances by Washington and Hawke are very good and very steady throughout, but the script seems to be thrown together. Basically, it's a mess. I would have liked to see more of a build-up concerning the deal with the Russians-it's almost presented as an afterthought.Yup, more clarity in the narrative would have made this film a whole lot better...Episodes of the Shield are better written than this!"
3,An average Hollywood movie,"There is everything a typical Hollywood movie has in this movie: violence, sex and an not-so-logical story. You are entertained with the cool acting by denzel washington, but as the story gets non-sense, especially in the ending, your expectation will be betrayed."
3,"Great Beginning, end a disaster","I've rarely seen a film with such a promising beginning go so terribly wrong at the end. The first half crackles with tension as the Denzel shows the ropes to the wet behind the ears new guy.The second half degenerates into typical Hollywood crap, with a formulatic ending and Denzel going over the top, as usual. If they had been able to keep the story as taught and gritty and Denzel as restrained as they were during the first half, it would have been one for the ages."
3,Washington & Hawke deliver strong performances,"This is a movie that wants to be a hard-hitting, powerful, blow-your-mind about cops kind of films, and it comes very close to that mark. Denzel Washington goes fairly deep into his dark side as he portrays Alonzo Harris, a dirty cop who meets out his own brand of street justice. Ethan Hawke, playing a naive rookie looking to be promoted, becomes more and more appalled as Harris' corruptions are revealed, and he is drawn into a web of deception and crime.I suspect people will come down on different sides, in terms of how much they sympathize with or despise Washington's character - he dances on (and then stomps all over) a very thin line between making sure criminals are punished and making a mockery of the law. Where will you stand?"
2,Waste of time.,"Although the filming and acting is good,...The language is terrible and unnecessary, and almost made the film un-watchable for me. The movie doesnt have a point. For the first hour you wonder were it is going, and then the ending doesnt really resolve any of the subplots that I saw 'sort of' develop. Also you have seen this before a hundred times. Basically a waste of plastic. There are many other movies worth renting."
2,Very Unimpressed,"I heard from numerous people that this movie was great. I was so excited when it finally arrived on DVD. Boy did I make a mistake. The acting was very good yes, but the story did not have an ounce of believability. The story about Denzel's character having to pay off the Russians, or whoever they were, was so dull and seemed like a mistake at the point of the film where it was introduced. Watchable but very uninspired."
3,Ups and Downs,"The movie was great, but I was rather disapointed in the performance of Ethan Hawke. He is a horrible actor in my opinion, and is the reason I did not like the movie as much. Denzel Washington did deliver an amazing, and deserving of the Oscar (I heard he got. Didn't watch the Oscars myself). I would reccomend renting this before you spend the [money] on the DVD."
4,Good movie....RENT FIRST,Its a good movie but the plot can get confusing sometimes. After you watch it a few times you kind of get tired of it. But it all depends on your taste in movies and how fast you get tired of watching movies over and over again.
3,Not what I expected.,"Expected after Denzel getting his Oscar for the movie to be atleast worth buying. The movie was a disappointment. Keeps your suspense at the beginning, then slowly goes downhill. Movie wasn't horrible, but defintely wasn't an Oscar performance by far."
4,The end justifies the means?,"Ethan Hawke plays a young policeman who wants to enter the narcotics division of the L.A.P.D. He is teamed up with a cop played by Denzel Washington who is supposed to train him and test whether he would make it on the tough streets of L.A. Hawke discovers in an ever more horrifying day that Washington will do whatever he considers necessary to get the job done. The senior cop alternately shocks, bullies, and terrifies the rookie with every kind of mayhem imaginable. Both men put in terrific performances in this gritty, raw tale of life on the narc squad. Be forewarned that there are lots of tough scenes in an ever-escalating tale of terror and corruption."
4,Intense film - dark and disturbing,"Training Day is a very captivating flick. Denzel does a great job of playing the hardened cop with a very dark and evil side. Ethan Hawke plays off him well as the innocent rookie - the young and hopeful.Some of these scenes were just gripping in their intensity. The drama mixed with extreme violence will leve you breathless at times.One thing I question: I'm not so sure the line between lead and supporting actor is clear in the film. Denxel is the ""lead,"" but I honestly think Ethan Hawke could have been considered the lead actor. Just my opinion though."
3,NOT A POSITIVE MOVIE,"This was not a movie that makes a person feel good after watching it. It was about a bunch of Police officers who are criminals and killers and think this is the right way to be. I think the acting was good, all the actors did a fine job & the ending was just. I would not recommend this movie since this movie did not make me want to watch it to the end or have a positive message."
3,Much to violent,"I have always enjoyed Denzel Washington in the movies he has done, but did not like this one at all. The movie was much to violent, and did not give a favorable protrayal of cops. I didn't think that he deserved the Oscar for this performance and for a movie of this nature.I would not recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 18. If you have to see it, go to the theater or rent it, but don't buy it. I did and will probably not watch it again. There are alot of movies I would watch again and again, but this is certainly not one of them."
1,More than dislike,"Dislike is too weak to express my feelings. I bought the movie after seeing reviews and absolutely hated this movie. The action parts seemed contrived. The characters so flawed that no one was likeable. I didn't even like Ethan Hawke's character. He was so weak in the beginning of the movie that his sudden change to a ""man of character"" didn't work for me. I just got the feeling that the director and cast decided to experiment with a new genre and it didn't work out."
1,Wouldn't have paid to see this,"The previews to this movie are extremely misleading, the film lacks a decent story and is basically a violent shoot em up bad cop flick! Denzel Washington is definately not meant to be the bad guy, although convincing in his portrayal, it somehow did not fit. Ethan Hawkes preformance was shoddy at best.I have not seen very many movies that are this bad, however I rented it for free and yet still feel as though I paid too much!If your into watching two straight hours of violence then this might be the flick for you, however if you are looking for a film with at least a bit of a story behind it, then you should definately look elsewhere because this is certianly not it!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"It's sad that as talented as Denzel is that he won the oscar for this [junk]. He is a terrific actor, but I guess it was a black year, no way was he better than Russell Crowe. He has done many great movies, for which he deserved an oscar, but this was not one of them."
1,Training Day,"This was one of the worst Denzel films I have ever seen. I expected something amazing (after all he did win an oscar for the role) . This film does not compared to the other great work he has done (Malcom X, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bone Collector). I feel sorry that of all the roles Mr. Washington has played this is the one which Hollywood most appreciates.It is the typical Hollywood portrayal of Black men. Negative."
4,"""Hey, pig, you ever had your s__t pushed in?""","Ha hah hah! That was a GREAT sequence and a funny line. Also good was when the talk of an insane man in court putting his hand down the back of his pants, back out and up to his mouth with fingers covered in s__t. But it wasn't s__t, it was PEANUT BUTTER! He was declared INSANE and eventually released! Great performances throughout (including Snoop Dogg). King Kong ain't got nothin' on me!!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THE worst! Washington and Hawke exchange badly scripted rants in performances no better than those found in really wretched community theatre. Fuqua's uninspired directing turns this movie into a typical made-for-ghetto blaster. The corrupt-cop genre has been done better MANY times before. As for Oscar, God in not great, D. In this case, God is overly generous."
1,What's that smell? Oh . . . it's cheese.,"This ""film"" was a painful experience from start to merciful finish. This movie was Copland, Boyz in the Hood, and Colors rolled into one film of far lesser value. If you are looking for a well written and interesting ""action/drama"" skip this one and try ""American Yakuza""."
3,a dirty movie,"About half way through this movie I starting getting sickof it. The Denzel Washington character of the undercover vice cop is painted as black on black.He kills his long time friend who he calls his ""Dog"".He tries to hire the killing of the rookie Hoyt.Some people may like this sort of movie as being realisticbut the LA Police have a long history of documentedabuse of their powers.The acting is very good in this movie, so that you believethese roles are factual.I think this movie makes me like [...] Tracy...."
4,Denzel's Definitely Different In Here,"A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans when it was released. I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one ""Alonzo"" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one ""Jake"" (Ethan Hawke).This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started.I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one."
5,More proof that Denzel is a great actor!,"Denzel Washington is one of the best actors if not the best actor in the history of movie making. He further validates that with his performance as Alonzo Harris, a rogue veteran detective with questionable behavior. Ethan Hawke is equally outstanding as Jake Hoight, Alonzo's idealistic and conscious rookie partner. The story really takes off when Jake discovers the other side of Alonzo. Now it's a battle of wills as Jake sets out to stop Alonzo once and for all. This is a kick ass movie with great action and an excellent story line. Like Alonzo's phrase, this is a boom!"
4,awesome,"This was a flawless performance by Denzel and Ethan. This was not a shoot em' up type of flick. It did not have a lot of action but it did have two solid performances by great actors, which made this movie. Denzel definitely deserved respect for this role and this is a definite buy for a real dvd lover."
2,dull,"Tediously written and dialogue heavy. It would have been better as a play than a movie, with so much dialogue. And Ethan Hawke is really miscast...he's frail and pale and totally unbelievable as an L.A.P.D. cop. Denzel Washington's performance is contrived. He's not believable as a hard manipulator. I know he won the Oscar. But I still think his performance falls short."
3,"i saw it in theaters, and i was ""okayed""","I saw this movie in theaters, it wasn't that great. i still don't say that i liked it even after the awards it won. The best scene is when denzel gets shot by the russian mafia. that scene is worth 3 stars."
4,So tense it hurts,"""Training Day"" is unflinchingly bleak yet so much more morally realistic than other cop dramas. But for one ridiculous coincidence which allows Jake (Ethan Hawke) to miraculously avoid having his brain sprayed all over a bathtub, this is an exceptionally fine film. The tension is agonizing, the performances superb, and the script has something important to say. Denzel Washington is magnificent as always, though I'm not sure his performance was Oscar-worthy. But no matter. He surely deserved one for ""The Hurricane"" in 2000 but lost out to man-of-the-moment Spacey in ""American Beauty"": another occasion when a brilliant actor got an Oscar he deserved, but probably not for that performance."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"This movie is SWEET. Denzel totally rocks, he plays a bad dude that you really don't want to mess with. This movie is just awesome, every part of it, it's the sweetest movie I've ever seen."
4,Don't miss out this movie!,I didn't though that Training Day was going to be this good. This movie has lots of action to keep you on your seat pretty entertained during the whole movie.
2,"This is not entertainment,","nor is it even enlightened social commentary.It's just another fantasy movie about a good guy (white rookie cop who lives in suburban LA - what was his last job? corporate CFO?) and a bad cop (black guy with Latino wife living in middle of gang infested jungle - I haven't been there, so can't comment). This movie is a downer from start to finish that left me wonder why I spent two hours with it.Denzel best actor? Not based on this film. The political tide of Hollywood finally turned his way. Sure, the character is scary and creepy, but he's ultimately just another Hollywood fantasy thug.I gave it two stars, because it at least inspired me to comment on the sad state of moviemaking these days."
4,"Well acted but false images of ""the jungle""",I saw this film twice and thought that was a good film. Denzel delivers a powerful performance and he takes charge of the gloomy film as it violently wages thru the 122 minutes...
3,Ethan got robbed.,"I'm still not clear on why Ethan Hawke was nominated for best supporting actor for this film, since he's the star, or co-star at the least. And his performance was much more nuanced and convincing than Denzel sleep-walking through another tough-guy role. Of course the twist on this one was that he's the bad guy. But we've seen it all before, and better, in some of his other films (of course, The Bone Collector was a huge piece of garbage, too...).So I give Ethan five stars and Denzel two. And you gotta subtract some brownie points for the everybody-gets-what's-coming-to-them finale that is completely disjointed from the cynical tone the rest of the movie carries. Hollywood is out of ideas."
3,Gotta Love Denzel but...,"I have been a huge Denzel Washington fan for a long, long time. His nearly flawless portrayals always hit the mark, and this is no exception. If you're looking for gritty, down and dirty urban cliches this is your film, but it left me wanting. Maybe I wanted to see some kind of redemption, some bit of humanist in Washington's character. There is none -- but of course that's the point. I supposed the problem boils down to this: Denzel is too good in his portrayal of a corrupt, cynical, and debased police officer. It was a disturbing bit of ""realism"" and it took a while to get it out of my head. Denzel's portrayl, so against type for him, is impeccable, but it is just too disturbing to provide any real form of ""entertainment."""
5,very realistic HD-DVD presentation,"This is a wonderful movie, fantastic acting, great story. The HD-DVD completely does justice to both the aural and visual aspects of this motion picture. The soundtrack is very lively and the image captures all the grain and oversaturation perfectly. Highest marks on this HD-DVD."
2,Not good,"Aside from Denzel's character throwing obsenities around every five seconds, this movie did not hold the viewer's attention. Although the events took place in one day, the movie dragged on for what seemed like a week. Denzel has just played the protaganist too many times; his transformation to an immoral cop did not show his range as an actor...it just proved trying too hard to be ""evil"" ends up making you look like the exaggerated villian of a melodrama."
2,Wake me up when it's over,"I'm very pleased that I only RENTED this movie. Why this was worth an Oscar is a mystery to me. As the DVD doesn't contain any ""extras"" disregarding the usual trailers stuff, this really isn't a Collectors DVD.The movie never gets around to a motive for the actions. There is ths good guy and this bad guys. The good guy could have gone away from the bad guy many times before the action really starts. But why the good guy stays around the bad guy seems a real mystery. Why the bad guy is a bad guy is obviously not interesting as we never even get a hint why someone becomes corrupt and crazy as Denzel plays.The actors are fine (not great) - I have a problem with the story line. It's clear that lots and lots of background scenes have been cut out leaving you with an empty feeling and not really enganged in the movie as it runs.If you don't believe me - rent it first - it's not worth owning."
4,Overall Good,"The acting is supurb by all, especially Denzel. I had some qualms about the type of character he played in order to get the statue, but actually seeing the movie put all that on the backburner. This film is not as cookie-cutter predictable as most cop dramas and in fact I was left honestly waiting to see what would happen next. There was a point where I felt the movie was dragging, but when the credits rolled I didn't feel at all cheated of my time or money."
3,decent at best,wasnt the great movie everybody made it out to be hokey rapstar level acting but not even good for that genre denzel is the only decent actor and even he isnt that great in this beware u might fall asleep
5,Training Day,"This is the type of film that you see once and remember vividly for some time. It's a great story. Both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke give good performances. The DVD includes additional scenes and an alternate ending. As soon as I finished watching this movie, I wanted to see it again."
4,"Washington and Hawke Power the Relentless ""Day""","This movie will probably be remembered as one of the best urban crime films ever, mostly because of the hellish presence of Denzel Washington, the fine acting Ethan Hawke, and the ultra-gritty directing Altonie Fuqua. The film follows Hakes' character in his first day in LA's notorious Narcotics Division. There he meets Washington, a veteran of the Division, whose morals have been corrupted by years of seeing the worst of humanity, or his appetite for power, which ever you believe, but either way he seems to give justification to every action he takes (""Were wolves among sheep, it takes a wolf to kill a wolf."") But some of Washingtons' action seem to go far beyond the line, and Hawke questions his reasons for them. The movie is also given a great, challenging script in order for the actors and the audience to question the limtis of the law, and power."
4,They messed up the ending.....,"I generally liked this movie. Good to great performances overall, but hey, look at the car as Denzel is about to get blown away at the end. Funny that not shortly before both the front and rear ends were totalled in the fight scene between him and Ethan. What happened, did he find a body shop in the middle of the night that did perfect work in five minutes? The damn car looks brand spankin new. This is what's always bothered me about ""Training Day."" If you're gonna spend so much time and energy making things realistic, why not cover all the bases?"
3,Good Movie but...,"Training day was a better than average cop movie but not as great as the hype. Hawke's performance is adequate and Washington's is very good but not quite oscar material in my opinion (I have seen much better performances not even be nominated). If it would have been up to me Crowe would have gone away with the best actor Oscar for 'A Beautiful Mind' in which he delivered a much more powerful, dramatic, oscar worthy performance than Washington in this film."
4,A Powerful Epic of CRIME/DRAMA ever told. Denzel Made This.,"Denzel Washington plays an oustanding Performance.. and one of the best roles hes played. This show wouldn't be good , if it hadn't been for him and his great role play in one of most powerful Crime/Dramas ever told.It shows how LA, california is all about.. in the neighborhood of how society can reflect to others who haven't lived that moment.Denzel made this movie what it is. He can play just about any character. Hes a Legend of hollywood.Ethan Hawke played well too.The movie gets real intense.. and gets you on the edge of more and more interests growing in your mind."
2,"Denzel Shines, Average Film at Best",Denzel Washington Finally switched His Game up here.He was becoming the Babyface of Movies where you could tell His Next Line 5 Minutes in Advance but this Film He takes a whole different turn.Ethan Hawke does pretty Good in a Judd Nelson(New Jack City Meets Donnie Brasco)Meets Johnny Deep kind of way.but the film on a whole is very Cliche in spots where it only shows certain elements but misses taken the Picture fully.everything about the film after a while becomes predictable&after almost a Hour it loses steam.while it exposes some interestign Elements it suffers from not being able to hold on&it spreads to thin overall.Denzel does a Solid Job in this otherwise Patchy Film.
5,Denzel is brilliant,What a brilliant piece of acting. Denzel Washington did an excellent job. This movie is worth watching.
2,I expected much more from an actor i admire so much,"Training day is an over the top violent movie that excedes credibility on all levels. I could not recommend this movie for its violent content,foul langauage and script absurdity. I have found denzel to be one of today's better actors and wished he had one the oscar for one of his past performances that he could be proud of.Though the movie is intense and carries with it heart pounding performances they are monotonal through out the movie with little to no depth of character. Shock value does not sustain a movie. So even though i am the minority here i can not recommend this movie-- go see Hurricane that was the oscar."
4,"ANOTHER ""OSCAR"" CALIBER PERFORMANCE FROM DENZEL","first of all, CONGRATULATIONS to denzel washington for winning an oscar (finally). i suppose he did not need the little statue to validate his acting. but, it is always nice to see dedicated actors get their just due. training day is not unlike any of denzel washington's other movies, with him turning in a great performance. except one thing: he does not play the hero in this one. from ""glory"" to ""remember the titans"", the audience has always rooted for him to triumph. in this film he plays a corrupt officer who takes the law into his hands far too often. being that this is DENZEL playing a dirty cop, you still root for him to change his ways and somehow redeem himself by the end of the movie..."
3,Depends on your likes,"It is a violent movie with good actors, about police corruption. If you like movies that are about so many negative things, you will like this one. The actors are good, I just prefer movies with a more positive tone."
4,Must own Blu-Ray,"One of the finest films of Denzel Washington very impressive career, Training Day is a must have for all Blu-Ray owners, because this film clearly demonstrates the huge difference between DVD and the high definition formats. Initially, I was skeptical about this film on next generation formats, but the impressive sharpness and three dimensional nature of a great many shots, sold me on it right from the beginning of the film. While I remember this movie being bland and demonstrating a lot of crush in the nighttime shots at the conclusion of the film on DVD, the Blu-Ray showed all of those scenes the way they should look and infused a film that has a very limited palette of colors with a lot more life. So sit back and enjoy a great film in a great transfer with Ethan Hawk and Denzel Washington at the top of their games."
3,"Outstanding Film, just not my taste...","This is another phony black cop, white cop buddy movie. I feel the plot and relationships in these movies are not realistic. In this one, both actors do great characterizations, especially Denzel. It's very intense from the very beginning. I was O.K. until about three-quarters of the way through the film when the bullets start to fly, and it turned into just another...action movie. Luckily, the good guy wins in the end. Objectively, it is an excellent movie, but not my preferred choice in entertainment."
4,Excellent Movie Made by Excellent Acting,"This is a excellent movie that could have been dangerously bad had anyone else had the lead rolls. Denzel Washington plays one of the best bad ""good guys"" in recent history and Ethan Hawke works well with his over the top counterpart.What makes this movie work is Hawke's right and wrong perspective of the world and how it is slowly shattered by Washington's good guy gone bad cop. Washington, lets the character grown in the course of one day, only going over the top when it is truly needed. His soft spoken to explosiveness gives his character the insanity needed.The deleted scenes were interesting, but would not have changed the movie all that much.This is one of the few times the Acadamey made the right choice for Best Actor."
2,It's more like a drama than an action movie,It's more like a drama than an action movie. It has its moments. It's worth watching once.
2,Disappointing movie,"This movie was a great disappointment to me....I suppose I didn't expect it to be so full of violence and deceit. My husband says I wear rose colored glasses, so it was much too realistic for my taste. I guess it's one thing to know something like that might actually happen, but to see it is another story. Denzel did a good job, however....can't knock his acting in this, but the movie on a whole left me feeling sad."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though it's refreshing to see Denzel Washington play someone who isn't a saint, his character is evil just because the screenplay demands it, not because of any intrinsic reason; as a consequence, the movie never manages to be about anything but itself."
1,Did they really give him an award for this trash?!!,"This was not a good film. One questions whether the folks at the Academy even bothered to watch this film before they voted on the award for Denzel (who by the way didn't do any better a job with his acting in this film than you would expect from the average actor). If you have not seen it, do so, for it will expose to you the fact that these awards were politically motivated, there really can be no other option...and you will understand after you see this...for it was not talent which earned any awards here. I really do like Denzel in most film, just not this one....and if you see it...I am willing to bet...you will agree!"
1,I hated this movie,"I first of all am not a Denzel Washington fan. So my review is a little biase in the sense that I went in thinking this movie was going to be bad....and boy was it. I first want to say that Denzel Washington is a good actor he just doesn't do anything for me. I thought this movie was waaaayyyy over the top unrealistic and I could not in good consious recommend it. For one thing all the singers and rappers in the movie who can't act took away from any beliveable scenario. Ethan Hawkes character was such a wimp he had literally no back bone. Every ""bad"" thing that Denzels character wanted him to do he did it. I think this is one of the worse movies I ever seen. And the ending who didn't see that coming a mile away."
1,Tired cliches and stereotypes.,"Oscar winning performance, indeed. This movie is an amalgum of every cop movie made in the last 20 years. There are no surprises, and the plot is transparent. Anyone could've played the Washington character, including some of the bums I pass every morning on my way to work. What a stupendous waste of my money and time. Save yourself!"
1,so bad!,"i would just write bad 1000 times, but frankly it's not worth it. denzel washington is an amazing actor, here he is showboating to no end, and does a poor job at it. ethan hawke at least doesn't embaress himself, although he was in this muck."
1,1 star only because there's no ZERO,"this movie starts off pretty good, but then gets completely ridiculous. it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
1,overrated junk,"After Denzel won his Oscar, I rented this expecting a great performance in a great film. I got neither. The film was utterly mediocre and, frankly, boring. Not because there wasn't any action, but because none of the actors gave me any reason to care about the characters. And all Denzel should have gotten was an Oscar for Best Shameless Scenery Chewing by a Lead Actor. This movie, and Denzel Washington's performance in it, are absolute proof that the Oscars are blatantly political and have nothing to do with the actual quality of any given performance."
1,Clean up the LAPD,"I kept hoping for a morale to this ugly movie.In fact, I tried and this is the conclusion I came to: If this movie causes the LAPD to be forced to clean up its act then the movie will have a redeeming factor. The movie is so full of violence and ""shockers"" that I became bored with them and was anxiously awaiting it to end. If I had been the rookie, I would have had the bad cop stop the car and let me out when he offered the pipe. End of movie; but, no, we are somehow ""required"" to buy into the training day ""test"" proposition. The rookie was an idiot at every turn running the gauntlet knowing it was all rotten to the core--for what purpose. The prize? A big home in a better area of the burbs for his wife and daughter while he rolled in filth all day. The only thing he said in this film that rang true was that he should have been a firefighter.If this is LA, California should drop into the ocean."
3,Not a Good Film,"First of all the acting performance of Denzel Washington is very good in this film, But that doesn't justify a good film. First of all they never give any proof that Denzel is actually a police officer. You never see him in uniform. You never see him going to the police station. So what's up with that?...!... This film is badly directed and written. Flat out! Denzel doesn't make it any better saying the ""N"" Word over and over again. What I kept asking myself is what was his motive for doing the stupid things he was doing in this film. I was embarrassed as an African American male watching this film. All he does is ride around in a car playing mister bad guy. Ethan Hawke had a couple of good scenes. The director did a bad job and the screenplay could've been better. Flat out. Now u see film isn't getting nominated for anything. Only Denzel's performance. Geezz....."
5,HOTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is the hottest of the year.This movie was a great way for Denzel to show his real talent.He took on a role that is totaly different from any other he has done.Hawk also had an alstar act in the movie.If you like any gangster movies and/or drug movies you will love this.If you like this you should check out the movie Colors. Peace.
3,"Powerful, disturbing","This movie was both powerful and disturbing. That being said, I would never watch it again. The violence, the language, and the wanton disregard for the sanctity of human life is appalling. While it may be realistic, and the movie may be well-done, I cannot endorse it for viewing. It makes me sick."
4,It made the cut.,Denzel's outstanding preformance brought him home an oscar for best actor in a leading role in this fresh new thriller that kept us waiting for a decade to come out. It's so unpredictable and thats what makes it a classic thriller. The cast is great and the storyline makes sense beyond what we imagined it to be. This is a must see movie.
4,Great Performances! Disturbing! Very Disturbing!,"Training Day was not one of Denzel's best films but he more than earned his Oscar just spanning his career he should've got it for Hurricane and Malcolm X ... Anyway lot of folks out there think it wrongfully depicts cops as basically corrupt, anti-social, authoritarian parasites and really I've met many of those types in my very bad habit of driving while black but there are good cops out there and they are the norm. This movie was very disturbing in the sense that people in a position of power and authority will more than likely abuse it and shamefully at that I mean police officers are human beings and given power and authority on certain levels can turn anybody into a sociopathic monster. It's just terrifying to watch a character on screen that was so twisted morally and basically evil. I was reminded of the pimp in Taxi Driver and for some strange reason that crazy guy who hardly said a word in Fargo."
2,2 1/2 stars really,"The problem with this film is that is was more designed as a vehicle for Washington to show off his tremedous acting ability than to actually create a solid story. Even the best actor can be limited by a bad script which is what happens in this movie. Denzel Washington is in my opinion in the top 5 actors of modern film, but a movie like this just doesn't give him the room he really needs to stretch out and show off the amazingly varied characters he can create. But, of course, this was the Academy's year to award the black actors (Washington and Halle Berry), both of whom are much better actors than their oscar winning roles showed them to be. If only the academy had given them oscars for the roles they truly deserved, then the academy wouldn't have to award less than stellar roles out of guilt. Any Denzel Washington role is still better than 90% of the other roles out there, but his better roles (Hurricane, Malcolm X) lie in the unawarded 10%."
3,3.2,"This movie is a sucker in progress. It doesn't quite suck, but it's not great. Don't let any big scary people like the Academy award men tell you any different. The acting is good, but the movie is average. I like watching Ethan Hawke stoned, because while he's training now, he'll hopefully get physically stoned in his next movie."
5,great movie denzel was superb,"This was a classic that I wanted to add to my dvd collection...I had it on vhs....great action movie, all actors were great...love Denzel in this new role...thanks for the great customer service I recvd..."
4,Good but maybe not realistic?,"I have to say I loved this film. Principally, because I empathised so much with Hawke's character that I spent at least the first hour of the film trying to make excuses for Washington's character's behaviour. Perhaps I am just slow or naive, but I genuinely could not decide whether Washington was good or evil or just human in this film until the last half hour or so, when it becomes very obvious. I was sitting there debating with myself; is that truly the only way to approach this? Is there no other? I study Criminology and as such, the film was fascinating. I make no pretence that it was a particularly deep or thought-provoking film, only that it did address issues that I am interested in.I fully admit that I am no expert on crime on the streets of L.A. and so I make no judgement about how realistic this film was, except to say that while probably overdramatised, the issues raised are extremely relevant and far more common that you might believe."
4,Good movie,I like the way the movie slowly reveals Denzel's character's dark side. He goes from being a tough guy in the beginning to being a total psycho but the end of the movie. And the ride the take you on is crazy. Denzel Washington as usual does some great acting. Ethan Hawke's portrayal of a wet behind the ear narco is top notch. I love the cameo by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre also.
5,Alonzo Harris,Denzel Washington's Academy Award performance of crooked cop Alonzo Harris makes for one of the best Los Angeles crime dramas.
2,"Oh, come on!!","First, let me say that Denzel Washington puts in a good performance. It's not an academy award performace, but it's good. And it's not his fault. The character is written to be a one dimensional thug, and that's Denzel plays. He's the typical bent cop that turns up in movie after movie. Ethan Hawke's character is a far more challenging role, and he also plays him well.The real problem with the movie is the ludicrous plot. The movie consists of one ridiculous and incredible scene after another. You'll find yourself muttering ""oh, come on!"" time and again, especially toward the end of the movie when the story dispenses with what little credibility it ever had to begin with...."
2,Dissapointing,"I was very disappointed by this movie. I was expecting big things out of it but I just couldn't see Denzel in the ""Bad guy"" role. I actually found myself laughing at times when it was supposed to be serious because it was so funny too see him acting like that. Also I thought that Ethan Hawke was horrible and it is a joke that he was even nominated for best supporting actor. If you want to see a performance where Denzel really shines then buy the Hurricaine or Malcom X"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,I don't know why this movie got as good reviews as it did. This movie was good but it wasn't great.
5,Oscar Nominations Warranted,"I have to say, I really missed out on this one in the theaters. But after watching it on DVD, I can see why both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke were nominated for Oscars. Both gave riveting performances. The story itself was good...it kept you at the edge of your seat. Definite must have for your collection"
5,great,i loved this tale of crookedness. denzel washington plays his best role as the cop whos very crooked and ethan hawke is the rookie cop. alonzo (dw) exposes hawke to drugs and life on the streets. ok denzel deserves the oscar. hawke does too. this is the most realistic cop movie since one tough cop. just see this.
3,good acting bad writing nothing new,"Unfortunately many good actors have to suffer ridiculous idiotic scripts and this is one such case, hard to judge the movie fairly, as the plot is pointless, the only way to watch is just to go with the flow and forget the fact that nothing makes any sense at all.The acting is good and it raises the movie above the level to which it could have descended.pretty standard fare, completely undemanding and ridiculous storyline so ultimately pretty unsatisfying."
4,Routine Cop Drama Bolstered by Two Strong Lead Performances,"Denzel Washington is refreshing in an uncharacteristically nasty role as a corrupt cop. Ethan Hawke is also good as the rookie cop that serves as the moral center for the film.Those two performances aside, what you get is your basic cop drama. The ending strains credibility, but otherwise TRAINING DAY is a very watchable movie. Eva Mendes as Denzel Washington's significant other is an added bonus."
3,Good Tale of a Crooked Cop,"This movie I only gave three stars because the climax seemed to be thrown togather. the begining of the movie is spectacular. They develop the characters well and the forshadowing is excellent. But when it comes to the ending, i have to say, the ending was weak. It was a good idea, but it was poorly written."
4,Mixed reviews,"I watched this video and first thing I want to say is; The Academy passed up Denzel playing Malcolm X and Rueben ""Hurricane""Carter for this?It just goes to show you how the powers that be in Hollywood think. Don't get me wrong, he played the role and all, but I didn't like the character. You got this cop who ""trains"" this rookie cop who don't know nothing about nothing and gets caught up in this we. When he was coerced to take the drugs, he should have walked and asked for a transfer. But when he gets a beat down from the Latinos,all bets was off then. Basically,this guy wanted to be a good cop, and hooked up with a seasoned cop handling his own personal business on company time and got more than he bargained for in the process. This is one gritty film folks."
1,dont bother,"The movie was just like many other cop files/buddy films. Granted it can happen, but really, we have seen this all before. Greed takes over. We know cops don't make much, we know some have to find other ways. Been there, done that.And yes, Denzel got the big award. But he did better work in some of his past films. Much better than this one. Like Glory, or Courage under fire. Or Devil in a Blue dress"
1,ridiculous attempt,I thought this movie was a ridiculous attempt at turning a good guy into a bad guy. Denzel Washington isn't very good at pretending to be a bad guy.The movie drags on for 2 hours and has no point what so ever. Personally I turned the movie off after the first 45 mins because I was so bored.I think if someone wants to see a good movie...they should avoid training day.
1,Don,A great movie to watch if you find yourself feeling too good and want something to pull you down - make you feel really bad and down in the dumps. What a waste of a great actor like Washington.
1,Oscar? You've got to be KIDDING!,"This movive was terrible, let alone the flagrant attempt at street-esque scriptwriting. Come on."
1,This is bad..,"It has every cliched ""gang"",""bad cop"",""LA"",""Rookie caught between his partner and whats right"" scene going. One of the worst films Ive ever seen - on a par with trashy alian/monster B movies from the 1970s. Why Denzel was nominated & got an Oscar for this is a mystery.Why Amazon recomended it for my wish list is another!!!!I gave it one star because LA has some good restaurants...."
2,It's his training day.,"I saw this movie on tv once. My sister-in-law kept asking questions about it. Mostly my answer was just ""It's his training day"", as if repeating this helped answer the question of what was going on. I also speak louder to deaf people so they can hear me. The movie was bleh. Denzel Washington has one of the most symmetrical faces in Hollywood."
2,Too much unbelievability,"Denzel is a great actor, and I enjoyed the overall story, however there are way too many unbelievable scenes. Try running around LA pointing your gun at cars, people on the street, fighting in the street, and see how long it takes."
4,"Denzel is still the man, despite this mediocre movie","Seriously, the only reason I am giving this movie a 4 is because Denzel is in it, and Denzel is the man. I really didn't like this movie because of all the big time evilness and corruption all for the sake of it. It's so terrible to see how a cop could be so corrupt and wayward, as well as the hierarchy rule in the police department and agencies, that I had to wonder if such a level of immorality could really exist. You then look at the world around you and know that this is exactly what goes on all the time. Denzel's character as a bad cop did get his in the end-meaning his ""just deserts"". That's all I have to say."
1,What an awful movie,"I thought with the Oscar award given to Denzel that this would be a great movie, with great acting. Boy was I disappointed, what a stinker. If this is indicative of how Oscars get selected, I guess garbage like this will win many more. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Trash Day,"I fortunately discipline myself to rent a DVD before purchasing one with few exceptions. This was a waste of money to rent, and I would not recommend purchasing the movie. It was typical trash, and if your'e into glorifying gangsters, drugs, slums, and bad cops, and generally, an ""anything for a buck"" movie--this may be of interest to you. Insofar as an academy award for best actor--it had to be a political pick as surely quality acting was not criteria for this winner."
5,LOVE this book,"I LOVE this book. It gets its message clearly across in photographs of real kids & adults interacting, as well as in words. Highly recommended."
5,great book for learning,"Mr. Rogers works!I bought for my then 2yr old son as he started his preschool.He read it many times until he memorized the whole book, and used it."
3,Needs proofreading,Many typographical and/or grammatical errors. Story was quite predictable. Best character was the stepmother who was a bit off beat.
5,Lovely Fun Book With Great Characters,"Take a chance to read this book, it is a great read on a Friday after work in a hot bubble bath with a good Moscato or Chablis! Heroine is solid and strong, I really loved how she grew in the book."
3,Cute but very lite.,"Nerd in Shining Armor by Vicki Lewis Thompson is saved from being the same old Cheerleader falls for Nerd by several interesting plot twists. It is also fun and entertaining, but the tale lacks highs and could have used just a touch more danger. The healthy sexual attitudes were refreshing but everybody was just a little too nice to be believable. The bad guy was scary at times, but nobody was really afraid of him. Even though it was a bit too much like a fairy tale, it made for a nice quite afternoon read. The author showed true originality with her selection of characters and situations and I suspect she may yet come out with a block buster one day."
2,Okay,"I had high hopes for this book, but they were dashed within the first few paragraphs of this book. This book was just too unbelievable. From the sordid past of a girl from The Hollows in Tennessee to the stuck on a desert island with the computer programmer who turns out to be hot, the storyline was a bit too much. I admit that I did some skipping of pages here and there in order to get to the end to see what happened. I just had to know. :)"
4,No wonder I love nerds,"Very good attempt for a first time romance writer. I fell in love with Jack ... although Gen bothered me at times. I love the fact that all women think they're going to be the ones to change a womanizing jerk. And why, WHY?, do women feel the need to try and sleep with their boss. Other than that it was very sweet. A lot of southern terms that I don't even think are actually used. They detracted from the book a bit because there were just so many of them, but other that, a very fun read."
3,Good Read,"Pretty predictable, even from the title...but still good beach reading. I guess I would have enjoyed it more had their been a little more depth to the characters."
1,Boring,"What a waste of a day reading this. Made the people of Tenn look like ""nerds"". I like a good love story but this was just trash. Don't waste your time. No plot was so easy to see thru this just skimmed that last chapters."
5,Awsome Book,"its an exciting adventurous book, i couldn't keep my eyes off the book and it was an excellent storyline, even though it was too predictable it still kept me on the edge."
4,Maybe I'm weird,"I've read a lot of bad reviews about this book, so I went in with low expectations. But I have to admit, I really liked it! Sure it was hokey at times. It's mind candy. It's not meant to be great literature. That's why Kelly Ripa picked it last year. I had so much fun reading it. I actually even laughed out loud (To quote Gen ""so hard I almost gave myself hiccups"").The Hollow is satirical. Personally I think it's silly for someone to be offended by it. That's like a college student being offended by Animal House! It's a good fun read. That's what it's meant to be. I definitely agree with the reviewer from Florida."
3,"A Cute story, but not what I wanted it to be........","""A Nerd In Shining Armor"" had all the makings to be a truly wonderful read, but sadly....it failed. I loved Jackson..I thought he was sweet and adorably dorky..Gen was OK...so I was excited to see how things went when they got stranded together....what a disappoinment! It had its moments, but there werent enough scenes between them..the focus of the story flew around too much ..it took away from the relationship between the h/h...There was way too much attention paid to Gen's mom and her goings on...I dont want to hear about her story!! I wanted just Gen and Jack...also..the whole hillbillie thing was just stupid...these characters were underdeveloped and the story was thin..all in all it wasnt awful, but I wouldnt recommend it."
1,"No morals, no brain","I love Vicki Lewis Thompson--have read most of her books and find her funny and her characters believable.But not in this book. I couldn't stand the heroine. As much as I tried to, I can't like a young woman who is out for sex with any man who shows up. She lost her virginity when she was 15 to a kid who promised he'd take her to the movie. She plans to have sex with her boss who she knows takes a different secretary to his weekend meeting to have sex with her--the idea that she plans to marry him doesn't excuse her. It makes her sound even dumber. Then she has the hots for the nerd in no time.I also disliked her showing people from Tennessee as ignorant idiots who talk funny and have several illigitimate children because the women can't say ""no"".Try something else by VLT--her other books are great."
3,Cute but kind of dumbed-down feeling...,"I admit, I probably would not have read this book if not for the Kelly Ripa bookclub. From the back (and front) cover, the storyline wasn't something I usually go for - stuck up heroine, nerdy beta hero, not to mention stranded on a deserted island. The first few chapters didn't seem all that promising, but things did pick up once Jackson and Gen got situated on the island. I never did warm up to Gen's character, but Jack made up for her tiresome personality. All in all, it was a good read - sort of reminded me of the movie 6 DAYS AND 7 NIGHTS. I could have used less of the dumbed-down hillbilly schtick and more emotion and romance."
1,Tiresome and smarmy,"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read. It wasn't. It was tiresome ... to the point I just skimmed the last half. It was also smarmy as opposed to sexy. Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance novel. But this wasn't romantic. It was juvenile, almost painfully so, and the characters were complete idiots. Worse yet was the author's condescending attitude toward people from the state of Tennessee (for the record, I'm not from Tennessee but do have friends who live there). All I can say in closing is: Yuck!"
4,Fun Read!!,What a wonderful light read. This book was just what I needed after reading an intense book. Jackson and Gen came to life on the pages. I didn't want to put it down becasue I wanted to see what would happen next to the resident nerd and woman he secretly longed for since meeting her. Some parts of of the book made me laugh out loud. I will be looking for more books by this author.
5,"A sexy, funny read","This book was one of the best I've read this year. It was sexy, funny and sweet. I'd highly recommend it to anyone needing a break from the alpha hero. Trust me, Jack is yummy without being alpha."
1,total waste of time!,What a waste of time and energy. It took me forever to get through this book and I'm not ever finished with it. I don't think I'll ever finish it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I can't believe I wasted money on this! Save your money people..... I recommend you get yourself a cup of latte instead!
5,Nerd in Shining Armor,Excellent book for the summer bag. Easy reading and hard to put down.! Of course I fell in love with the characters.
4,Very Good Beach Read,Loved Gen and Jackson's interplay and getting to know each other. I didn't feel like it was rushed and you get to know the characters. Agree with some other reviewers that I wasn't too into the Elvis bits and some of the other things that the author did to try to get the reader to laugh. Enjoyed the plot and the sunny island atmosphere.
4,Wow! What a different type of romance novel.,Thompson really wrote with a lot of insight for her readers. Her wittiness is comical. This book makes you laugh out loud and keeps you interested especially with the suspenseful ending.
4,A Fun and Entertaining Read,"I bought this book in paperback five years ago and enjoyed it immensely. When I saw it on kindle I just had to re-buy it, since my original copy had gotten lost some time ago. I read it through a second time, and even though I knew what was going to happen. The story line was just as fun, entertaining, and scintillating as it was the first time I read it."
3,Thought it might be a cut above the usual romance novel,"I've been hearing little things about this book here and there, so when I saw it at Wal-Mart today, I grabbed it up. I thought that since it had been picked by one of the tv shows for its book read that Nerd might be a cut above the usual romance book.Alas, IMHO, no. It is a very usual romance book with cardboard characters and manipulated plots and unlikely dialogue, with a slightly clever twist---a nerd hero--- and a great title. Sigh."
3,"light, fun read","I'm an occasional romance reader, and I enjoyed this cute, sometimes silly, romp. The dialog was a bit contrived at times, but I found myself liking Jack and Gen and cheering them on."
5,A Masterpiece,If I had to make a list of the best heavy duty albums of all time this would be in the top ten. You get your money's worth with these guys. The song Eatin Dust will make your ear drums bleed and Mongoose is a masterpiece in itself. The mighty Sabbath would be proud.
2,Flunks as a Blue Cheer parody,"First off, a version of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Godzilla"" dipped in molasses oozes from the speakers. But there's no Buck Dharma and the singer is _worse_ than Eric Bloom. Which takes some doing, lemme tell ya. Fu Manchu's ""Eatin' Dust"" almost makes it as a parody of Blue Cheer: raw and brutal guitar riffage steeped in Big Muff fuzz punctuated by a truly useless vocalist who can be counted on to interrupt the mood with bursts of tone-deaf and incomprehensible chatter that is passed off as chant-singing. On ""Mongoose"" and ""Pigeon Toe"" the drummer, bass player and one guitar player are allowed to develop a nice amount of head-bang without the singer wrecking things too much but by this time ""Eatin' Dust"" is almost over. Fu Manchu forgets the dirty little secret of heavy metal: No one who claims to like Blue Cheer actually listens to ""OutsideInside"" or ""Vincebus Eruptum,"" ever. Probably an awesome live band, though."
5,grasshoppers velcro shoes,I purchased these for my mom after she had a hip replacement and was unable to bend to tie shoes. These worked great. They look nice and fit very well. The linen texture and beige color go with all her summer things. She is very pleased with the shoes. Never had a break in period with these either.
1,old part,Part ordered and sent was right number but wrong part new update cap is tan with white ring received tan with black ring call 254-582-2548 if you have any questions
5,Something about being detailed with pictures...,"With a game I have never thought I was going to play 4 years ago to this day, Baldurs Gate: TOSC has went beyond my expectations. This book was no exception... I really believe that pictures in a book more than express the writing within, and that was why I found this guide to be essential in my quests. For once... the maps and strategy parts were very detailed and gave me a sense of direction. Especially when I found myself caught up with the action and failed to notice what was my next move. It never helps to be fending off dopplegangers when a trap is unoticeably behind you. It is for real. I honestly think this book is top quality and a must have. Anybody can understand this without words."
4,Good protection,"The case hugs the player very well. The downside is that the case does not cover the front. I cut a thin, flexible piece of plastic to slide between the cover and the player. Problem solved and the player is fully protected. One reviewer commented about the hard belt clip. You can take it off."
4,Sandisk Green Sansa case,My son really likes the case. It has a belt clip and he is glad that he doesn't have to put his Sansa in his pocket anymore.
3,tries to cover too much ground,"The book delivers everything it says it is going to: 250 ideas for stylish home storage. The problem is that the scope of the book is far too large. You'll get storage ideas for every room in the house, for your garage, your garden, everything. This means when you really get down to it and want some stylish storage ideas for, say, your bathroom, there are really only 10 or 15 of them. I think it is more likely that most people are going to be interested in storage ideas for a particular room and thus a book that offered 250 ideas for stylish storage in the kitchen. Feel free to browse through this book in the bookstore but you'll probably want something a little more focused."
1,Many uses for this book.,"Uses: Hide a burn on table, no one will move it, use when you run out of Sear catalog pages, burn to get a fire started, hit your spouse, and the main reason to build outdated storage that didn't even look good in the 50's. This book is a zero for ideas. What do I have to pay you to take my book? Not even the generous one star I gave it."
4,Nice Wallet,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband as he saw a friend of his have one similar and liked it. I'm glad I read through the reviews prior to purchasing because some of the other similar wallet clips indicated the dollar bills were larger than the actual wallet size whereas this one was larger. The good part about the wallet is that it is larger so the dollar bills easily fit inside however, if you put more than 1 credit card and your driver's license in it, the wallet tends to get thick. All in all, my husband really likes it as he was using a money clip previously. It is a great transition between a traditional wallet and a money clip."
2,Not what I was expecting,A lot bigger than expected. The clip doesn't hold the money very well and it's a mess fumbling with the money trying to get it in and out of the wallet. I gave it a try for a couple weeks but never came to liking it so I gave it away and bought another style.
1,Broke immediately,The clip at the center of this money clip stopped working correctly after about a week. This was a waste of money.
3,Royce Wallet,The wallet is adequate but I am not sure that it is made out of leather. It is an odd material. Time will tell if it holds up....
2,defective money clip,"I purchased this to replace a similar wallet as it had a couple of extra card slots.It has a movable money clip metal insert. The clip opens wide to insert money then supposedly clips shut to hold it.Mine would not stay closed.I hate the hassles involved in returning an item so I did not file a claim or report this to the seller.I super glued it shut. It is quite loose now unless it has a lot of bills in it, but at least it is not flying open.I definitely prefer the clips that are fixed and made of a spring type metal"
2,Money Clip,"The cash clip wallet holds a good number of credit cards and other inportant information. However, the metal clip that is to hold your cash in place will not stay clamped down. It pops up and the cash bills are just loose. It is too risky to try using it. It may work fine if you have very few credit cards to carry but that is not the case with me. I have personal and business credit cards, insurance cards, AAA card, etc. The wallet just cannot handle that much. I was disappointed in the product. If it is going to have all these slots for cards, it ought to be able to handle a full load."
3,"Good Leather, but too Large for me","I hate big, bulky wallets and how they feel in my pocket. I prefer small, slim wallets for my license, bank card, one credit card and some cash. I thought this would be a perfect replacement to my old slim moneyclip wallet, but I found it too big. It has eight card compartments, too many for me. But the leather looks and feels good, and it did arrive very quickly. I will keep shopping for he perfect slim wallet."
3,wallet,"Nice wallet, but I thought it was less of a wallet and more of just a money clip. A little to large for my use, but well made. You good just use this as your only wallet."
4,Royce Leather Mens Money Clip Wallet With Two Outside Pockets,"Looked at many wallets and glad I chose this one. It's made we'll, looks good, and just enough pockets. It looks so neat and my husband likes it!"
4,Wallet..,I bought this for a gift.. looked just as it was advertised.. So with that said i will rate it a 4 star..
3,Could Stand Downsizing.,The quality of construction is great. It is a wider than I like. Four credit card slots inside instead of six would be plenty and make it easier to get in and out of your pocket.
4,"Attractive, good size.","For the last decade or so I've bought numerous wallets. I usually buy them specifically for the removable flip-out panel with ID window and credit card pockets. I don't like bulky wallets, but the plastic windows always tear, and when I carry cash (which I'm trying to do more now) I didn't have a place to hold it securely.This is the best of both worlds, and is attractive as well.The only complaints I have are that it's slightly larger than I was hoping (but still smaller than a bifold) and that it 'flares out' slightly at the edges. I'm hoping the latter will be fixed after I've sat on it long enough to break it in.Overall, I'm pleased."
4,holds much without being bulky,"The leather has great quality. if scratched, you can rub it and the natural oils from your hands smooth out the scratches. Great color and it holds sooo much without it being bulky. Excellency purchase and fabulous gift!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Not even worth renting.,"--And not even worthy of one star (but Amazon forces you to choose a rating, so hence--my one-star feedback). Oy. What a disaster. Unless, of course, you're Ms. Aniston or Mr. Rudd who are laughing all the way to the bank with their this-script-beyond-sucks-but-holy-crap-you'll-pay-me-how-much paychecks. This lame piece of junk is just a bunch of tired cliches tied together with continuous punches of look-at-how-vulgar-we-can-be that is being marketed as ""clever."" I'm no prude, but this is not even good bad humor. It's just ... TOTAL BLAH. Bottom line: When will Hollywood figure out that even with dirty comedy, you still need to employ writers who can actually write. Otherwise, it's just dirty schlock."
3,idiots,"If you commented that this movie shouldn't be shown to anyone underage, you're a flat out idiot. It's rated R for a reason you numbskulls...the rating association already told you what age it was appropriate for."
4,Unexpectedly refreshing,"I'm a Jennifer Aniston fan so I watched it only for her. I didn't expected anything because it was a box office failure or because of the bad critiques, but I'm happy I watched it. I expected a dumb non-sense film because of the bad promotion it had, but the movie is nothing like the trailer tries to show it. It has an amazing script, funny jokes, and a refreshing plot (nowadays, Comedy Films are about stupid jokes and dumb plots), but Wanderlust manages to balance comedy and drama when it has to without any effort. Jennifer and Paul make great chemistry, and it's amazing to see them back since the ending of ""Friends"".Watch it if you're looking for feel-good movies. You won't regret"
4,Paul Rudd,"Paul Rudd is always amazing, as well as jennifer aniston! The movie was pretty funny.. not the best but definitely not the worst."
5,great fun,I saw this movie on netflix and knew it would be one that I'd want to watch again. I was right!
4,Stupidly hysterical!,"This movie is wickedly funny! Is it kinda dumb? Yes. Will 20-somethings not ""get it""? Yes. But for anyone 50+ it will definitely give you ""flashbacks""! LOL!! (My 82-year old mother-in-law loved this movie!!) I admit I was surprised by the very brief but very graphic nudity, but can't imagine the film without it, as it is not what you think and is absolutely hysterical! Jennifer Aniston is perfect in this role, and Paul Judd gives a great performance as well. I could watch this again and again, it is so funny!"
5,Funny movie,Not our typical rom com ... Actually funny I watched it twice and recommended to some friends who thought highly also
3,An ok movie,Being a huge fan of Paul Rudd and also a fan of Jennifer Aniston I had very high hopes of this movie. But alas I came away a bit disappointed. While it does have it's moments hear and there on the whole it just wasn't as good as it should have been. The jokes kinda fell flat. One highlight was Alan Alda in a role you typically wouldn't picture him in. Other than Clueless this might have been Paul Rudd's weakest performance that I have seen. I thought Jennifer Anistion did a pretty good job and as always she was very easy on the eyes.
1,Not as good as I hoped.,"However, it was okay. But it's one of those movies where stupid things just keep happening. Gets old after a while."
2,it had potential,"It had a solid cast, a few jokes but overall I was rather disappointed in its drawn out storyline and failure to capture my attention. I think while watching it I kept checking Facebook to see if anything else was more entertaining than this movie."
2,If not a Jennifer Anniston Fan then don't waste your time watching!!,"The only reason I had to watch this Movie was because it stars my Favorite Lady of Hollywood, Jennifer Anniston, and I was also curious about her new Fiance, Justin Theroux, who is by the way a HUNK, and he also made the Movie really funny. It is a Corky, Screwball, Left Field Foul Ball of a Movie but it had its moments. If your a die hard Jennifer Anniston fan then yeah, you gotta see it, if not then don't waste your time. 2 StarsRobin, Athens, Georgia"
3,Predictable,"The movie was funny in parts, but there was a little too much nudity for my taste. More vulgar than enjoyable. It's always a toss-up with Paul Rudd. All in all, there weren't too many surprises in the film. I wouldn't watch it again."
1,A cr*ppy movie,"Only one word, awful. The only thing positive is that it shows just how screwed up the hippy movement was. I was in my teens when that experiment began and I was totally turned off."
3,Good movie,"As a fan of Paul Rudd, this isn't his best or funniest movie, but it's a good movie that has some really funny moments and hilarious surprises. At times it also has its ""all-to-predictable"" moments. Overall, decent flick. 3 stars."
3,good not great,Funny movie if you like Paul Rudd. Got a few different scenes that are really good. Definitely worth a rental.
3,ok for vegging,"Pretty mindless entertainment. I like Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd and, of course, Alan Alda. But, the storyline is a silly premise with caricature characters. No spoilers, here, but the end is no surprise. Wait for addition to Amazon Prime Instant Video Library before viewing this one. $1.99 on a weekend sale was $1.99 too much."
3,A mixed bag: funny and not; full frontal male nudity!; lots of f..k and other words.,"Rented for wife as expected chic-flic. It was ok. Funny at time for sure but then also serious, not funny at all at times. Do not see the need for all the 4 letter words (proof it is an adult movie??)And surprise with full frontal male nudity however brief it was. Guess flim guidelines are changing. Predictable but that ok. Recommend? Not sure."
1,Made me throw up,"I am not a prude. I watch lots of slasher movies including the first 3 from the saw franchise so I am not overly squeamish. Wanderlust however made me so nauseous that I lost my cookies in a big way. They kept describing smells....and then when the main character started talking dirty to himself in the mirror I just lost it. Might just be me but I doubt it. In the outtakes he even said he was grossing himself out. Maybe if I hadn't spent time in a commune myself back in the 70's the descriptions of the smells wouldn't have come across so vividly for me, but I wouldn't watch it again. I am curious to know if anyone else reacted like I did."
2,a few funny lines and scenes but overall a waste,"This movie was predictable from the beginning, crude and just plain bad. I would never recommend this movie or watch it again."
3,it's ok,"it's fun for all of the expected reasons, including the cast, but because of those very same reasons, it's just ok"
2,Movie Quality...Bad!,"The movie was funny and I liked it, but about middle ways it started acting up. It took a long time to get to the end. It would stop and start...a lot"
1,Horrible,"That by far was the worse movie Jennifer every made. I watch the previews of Chelsea lately and they promoted it to be the funniest movie that year. Boy, were they wrong."
3,WANDERLUST - Total FUN and great slapstick!,"WANDERLUST is NOT ""Wuthering Heights"" nor is it ""CITIZEN CANE!"" It is silly, funny, daring, hysterical and a FUN and entertaining film. If you want serious realism and characters with extreme depth - go find another movie. Personally - I love it!! David Wain is a director with vision and a keen sense of slightly over-the-top humor! LOVE IT!!"
4,Pretty smart for a dumb comedy,"This was a lot of fun, and a lot wittier and more insightful than I had expected. Still a dumb comedy, just a lot smarter than most."
1,Painful,I was completely disappointed in this film. I consider myself a Paul Rudd fan but I find myself questioning his mindset when he chose to act in this movie. From start to finish the movie drags on and on. This is one of those movies where you just hope it ends as soon as possible. It really is that awful! You are warned!
1,Worst movie ever!!,This is the worst movie I have seen. I was about to throw the TV out the window. Dont waste your money on it. Wait until its on TNT!
2,No regular disc,The blue ray is fine but the regular DVD wasn't included. The whole reason I bought it was for both and I only got the one. Little disappointing.
2,Is this what her career has become??,Couldn't even finish this movie it was so bad. It will be a long time before I try another Aniston movie.
1,Bad to the bone!,"This movie was bad to the bone. I can not believe how low some actors have gone for work. Not funny, not cute, nothing......."
1,Not for anyone under 18,This movie was so sexual graphic I would never recommend it to anyone. It was border soft porn. Horrible movie!
3,Wanderlust,"It wasnt the best movie that i have seen and it wasnt the worst movie ive seen. Overall it was ok, but i probably wouldnt see it again."
4,Good movie,Wasnt to sure when we rented it but ended up being a pretty good movie....for adults not one for the kiddos. Funny
2,Dumb Film,The best part of this video is some of the outdoor scenes. The plot is rediculous and the acting is mediocre.I would not recommend it unless you like to see a naked man.
2,No good,I think it is stupid I have to write 18 words to rate a movie. I think the stars should be enough.
3,It was OK,Cute movie here and there. Frustrating chemistry between Paul Rudd & Jennifer Aniston on screen detracted from the viewing experience.
1,skips the whole movie..,"This dvd was in the 'used-very good' condition category, but it skips the whole movie. It skips in some of the best parts, too! Overall, horrible quality."
3,Less than the best,"I was expecting this to be a lot more funny than it turned out to be, and I was expecting a lot more nudity than there is. There were a few sequences that made me laugh but not nearly enough."
1,awful,"I hated this movie. It seemed to have every cliche in the book. I expected it to be very funny, with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. It wasn't."
1,Not great,Too raunchy for my taste. Would not reccommend this movie. Still like Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd though - just not my cup of tea.
2,Lame and unfunny,"There were some great characters in here but either the actors, script writers, or the director couldn't bring it together to make it funny and entertaining."
1,previews are better then the movie,"Remember when you first saw the preview for the movie and you thought, ""this is going to be hilarious!"" Well, you were wrong...and don't feel bad, so was I. Thankfully, I had a coupon for this movie and it didn't cost me a penny. Don't waist your time...it really sucked. It wasn't funny, and it was predictible. If you are looking for an excuse to waist two hours and not get them back..this is the movie for you. And shame on you Jennifer Aniston...I thought you had better taste then to do a movie like this. I guess the $$ was too good to pass up."
2,Not great,"This movie doesn't have much going for it beyond the great cast. I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, but this movie just plodded along. The jokes were contrived and there was nothing really driving the plot forward. A lot of the characters were pretty horrible. There's a long scene where Paul Rudd is saying foul things into a mirror that just went on forever, and was not funny. I'd skip this one unless you are a die hard fan."
2,A Bad Movie,"If it wasn't for some boobage (tons of old lady boobage, tho.), I would have given this movie only one star. A really bad movie and the Jennifer Aniston character is pretty weak."
4,Wanderlust,"Wanderlust is a light comedy that requires no thinking on the viewers part. The characters are interesting to say the least. Overall an ok movie. Would I buy it, no. Would I rent it for a couple of bucks to kill a Saturday night, yes. In an age of reality television this is a much better alternative."
3,Disappointed,"Two of my favorite actors star in this movie, Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. That's why I gave it a 3 for them. I guess that is why I was interested in seeing in this movie in the first place. Glad I didn't pay movie theatre price to see this. Wait for this to appear on cable. It has funny parts but mostly this movie just gets boring. Oh well."
4,Wanderlust,It was pretty good...a little slow at times somewhat raunchy at others. Overall I would recommend the movie to adults.
3,Wanderlust,Not one of the best comedies I have seen. It was not a part I expected Jennifer Aniston to take. There were some funny parts.
1,"Peace, love & vomit",Theme-Urban YUPPIES get fired find peace in country retreat with society's castoffs-yawn! I thought they stopped making movies like this?
1,A 40 minute movie,"I think there is exactly 40 minutes of decent film here, the rest looks like they were literally making it up as they went along. You can tell that some scenes were being improvised on the spot and they made the final cut, which tells you something... Like I said, there is 40 minutes of good stuff here, funny stuff, but the rest of the sheeyit that was interspersed into the film made it hard to watch. Literally. There were some scenes where my friends and I were asking each other ""what the eff is going on here? I can't stand this anymore, can I fast forward past this to the next scene?"" extremely disappointing, especially when considering the talent that was cast. Oh well, at least I didn't waste $12 in the theatres on this dreck."
4,Good fun hilarious entertainment.,Lots of laughs in this nicely made comedy about trying to escape the pressures of everyday life and finding that the pressure just follows you in a different form. Great fun!
3,Mildly Amusing,A mildly amusing movie. At times funny but full of clichés. You'd be better off spending your money renting something else but if you are looking to waste an evening you can do worse than this!
3,Has its moments,This movie had some interesting moments....it's a comedy of sorts.....had a hard time with some of the characters but I don't think it was designed to win any academy awards.
3,Just ok,There were very funny parts but overall kind of boring. Would not purchase. Jennifer was great of course and Paul Rudd was hilarious.
2,Weird,"This movie had so much potential and just fell flat at every turn. It was very weird and had some pretty stupid moments in it. I just didn't get it really, and I have a pretty open mind."
2,Not so great,"This is one of those movies that seems like a great idea on paper, but mostly winds up making predictable and easy jokes. It leans on so many things we've seen before that it just left a bland taste in my mouth. It's nothing personal, as all the actors involved are mostly top notch, there's just no meat on this bone."
1,Funny in some parts,"Glad I didn't pay a whole lot to watch this movie, it was funny in parts but didn't really enjoy it overall"
1,They owe me stars! Movie is horrible. Absolute garbage.,"I hate to even give this one star.This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.. Tried to watch, but had to stop after 15 minutes. Thought Paul Rudd, Jennifer Aniston I like them both, need some light laughs. Boy was I wrong. Crude, stupid ""humor"". Paul & Jennifer should be ashamed to be part of this horrible piece of trash.If you truly want to waste your money and your time watch this movie. You will be sorry you did. Absolute garbage."
3,Fun movie - a little grimy at times,"Not one for the little kids to watch and it takes some of the slapstick humor over the top, but it still had some moments that you just may like. When it's only a 1.99 rental night go for it and make sure your date is okay with crazy sex humor it could be embarrassing."
3,Not as funny as it seemed in the trailer,"Be warned the trailer makes it seem as though your going to watch a cute, funny , hippy dippy romcom kind of movie. NOT SO!! Lots and I do mean lots of constant swearing and sex focus. I mean seriously who the heck spends that much time in their daily lives talking, thinking about and having sex. There is almost no story line here, I kept waiting and waiting and wating for it to pick up or get funnier or SOMETHING! I am not that hard to entertain. I like to just go with the flow of the movie and be surprised , moved, shocked...whatever, I do not over think my movies ,I do not try to jump ahead and figure it all out, I just ENJOY them like it is suppossed to be.This I did not enjoy very much. I gave it 3 stars because I did laugh at a few scenes and once I thought about it I could sorta see a message of some sort, maybe. I don't know it was flat and forgetable. I actually paused it and showered then came back and it wasn't any better.Eh!"
2,Seriously unfunny,"A great cast can't save this stinker. Tired plot, tired jokes. Got it as a bargain rental and still contemplated asking for a refund. Just not funny."
2,don't bother,mildly amuzing-that is all there is to say-acting-probably one of Jennifer's worst-she must have needed a paycheck-was fun to see Alan Alda
1,Disappointment,"As much as I like Jennifer Aniston, this is a very bad movie.In order to fully appreciate how bad this movie really is, one has to watch it till the very end. At first, it seems that the wife of the couple is the stupid one, while the husband is just tired and unlucky. But at the end it gets clear that both are complete idiots (and that is why they are married).There are only few funny jokes. Most of them are captured in the trailer for this movie.If you are still curious, watch it, but do not spend too much money. I spent around 20 dollars on DVD. It does not worth it."
1,another bad movie,"The acting is terrible. Can Jennifer Aniston ever play a role of some quality?This movie had weak characters and a weak story.Will the day ever return when we no longer have the need to show male and female genitals in order to sell tickets.I could go on forever, but please do not rent or buy this movie."
2,Very Disappointing...,"This movie, for me, had so much potential. Paul Rudd is an incredible comedic actor, and I had high hopes for Justin Theroux. Jennifer Aniston, in every role since Friends, plays the ""Rachel""- like character and frankly it is getting old. This movie is simply not funny."
1,Eh . . .,"Raunchy, vulgar, disgusting, and not all that funny. I like Jennifer Aniston (usually), but this one was not so great."
5,Paul Rudd in top shape!,"This movie is great from start to finish. Paul Rudd delivers another awesome comedy. Rudd and Aniston really seem to play off each other very well, and this is probably the best movie Jennifer has been apart of in a long time.The laughs are non stop, and some of the are pretty raunchy, so be forewarned, it has a R rating for a good reason and it earns every bit of it. The characters are just so off the wall, that each one brings their own comedic style, and they are all hilarious and work so great together.Check this one out for sure, you are guaranteed to laugh your ass off, I sure know I did."
4,cute,"Sooooo predictable. Its a typical comedy with characters likeable enough. Its mindless and pleasant not bad just ok, kinda like all of Jennifer Anniston films."
3,The movie is OK,This movie has some funny moments but overall it's not that great. With two really funny people as Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd I believe they could have done so much better
4,Funnier the more you watch it,"I love Paul Rudd. That said, you know his movies can be hit or miss. The first time I watched it, I though, ""It's OK."" But the 2 or 3 times I've watched since then, it's gotten funnier each time. If you're the kind of person who wants predictable, thoughtless comedy (i.e--you found ""Ted"" hilarious) you probably won't like this. If you like your humor a little less deliberate and obvious and a little more thoughtful (i.e.--you like 30 Rock) you'll find this pretty funny. It's not worth paying full price for, but it's definitely a rental with later purchase when it's like $9 at Walmart."
1,Used - Like New?!?,"First, there's a sticker on the front that says ""DVD Now Kiosks"" Insert This Way, clearly indicating this DVD was stolen from a DVD machine. Strike one.Besides the fact that there's no security tape on here, being that it's stolen, there's simply nothing ""like new"" about this. The top of the dvd has finger smudges, crumb-like particles, and unidentifiable crud. Strike two.If I could get past the apparently thievery of this dvd, I might be okay with it, if the dvd had at least looked like it was cleaned once. Didn't happen. Strike three.This product and purchase deserves a giant FAIL.Can't wait to re-gift this...not."
3,A Couple Hilarious Scenes Isn't Enough to Save This Comedy,"Wanderlust is a messy comedy that has a few bright spots, the biggest of which being Paul Rudd, who delivers some of the funniest lines the film has to offer. I'm still not completely sold on Jennifer Aniston's comedic talent as I didn't find her to be that funny. I'm not sure if that was her or the material she had to work with, which honestly wasn't that great. This one was middle of the road for me."
1,Paul Rudd Hurts My Brain,"This movie was painful to watch. It actually wasn't so horrible until a little bit in. For once someone in a Jennifer Aniston movie was more annoying than her character. Paul Rudd was horrible. In one scene he's talking to himself in the mirror to pump himself up for sex and saying things like, ""I'm gonna get all up in that vag."" And then he repeats this and the like for what feels like forever in some of the dumbest voices I've ever heard. Not funny at all. I'm hard to offend but this was just BAD. It would be insanely uncomfortable to watch this with any older members of my family. God, it was uncomfortable just watching this alone. Would any woman sleep with this man? The fact that two women in this movie wanted to seemed insane and just wishful thinking on the part of whatever idiots wrote this script. I kept praying some wild animal would eat Paul Rudd during this scene just so he would shut up."
1,Wonderlost,What a let down. What a waste of talented funny actors. What a terribly unfunny film. What terrible screenwriting. Unwatchable.
1,"Awful, awful, awful","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Did I watch it to the end? Well yes, I like my endings, but I fast fowarded it through about 20 minutes. It's not that it was too vulgar or that I am a prude. It is just a really bad movie. I like the actors, just not this movie."
2,two stars for the trailer,"This movie started out good but somewhere in the middle it just lost steam and got boring. They tried to wrap in a flimsy plot but it just fell flat. I dont even think it was really all that crude or vulgar just not funny. I do not recommend it, the trailer has all the good parts in it. I wish i could get a time refund."
1,Wanderlust,The Wanderlust- movie Would not recommend this to anyone. It was vulgar and really not something I would want to see again.
1,DONT RENT IT!!!,I LOVE inappropriate/FUNNY movies but this one is DISGUSTING!! there are some things that you cant unsee. DONT BUY IT OR RENT IT!!
2,big names but not that good,The movie was very strange but did get better at the very end. The comedy must've not been my style but I usually can do just any type of comedy.
1,Avoid!,"Not funny,bad story,ect.. Save your money! You will thank me later :-) if you wanna laugh look elsewhere..its not here"
1,awful,"Unless you like foul language, a bad plot, and other unpleasant things, you might want to avoid this movie. I love Alan Alda, but this was a bomb. I had mute most of the movie because it was disgusting. Stopped it finally when I couldn't take any more."
1,wanderlus,not much to say about the movie not happy with the video download from amazon. I will not ever rent a movie from this format again
1,Wander away from this movie.,"Ir's bad enough that you'll want your 90 minutes back after watching this waste of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston's talent (assuming you keep watching after the 'mirror scene'), don't make it worse by spending actual money on it. Wait for cable if you must."
4,Funny date night flick!,"Great date night flick. My wife and I rented it while having dinner in bed, and we really enjoyed it! Gave it 4 stars because it got a little slow in a few spots, but overall we really liked it!"
4,"Many, many interesting aspects","This is an heroic film; with very little budget, Kubrick delivers so many interesting and innovative things. It might be very rare that something like the electrifying box combat was filmed before or after. A veritable photographic ""tour de force""! The sequence of the ballet dancer is quite something as well. The history, quite short according to the limited time of the film, is nevertheless vivid. Atention to detail and great photography creates environments very efectively, like the dance club, the evening in downtown, the modest appartments, and the noticeable upward shots in the railway station."
3,Early Kubrick,"In all likelihood we'll never see Kubrick's first film, _Fear and Desire_, on video or DVD. So _Killer's Kiss_ is as close to the director's origins as we're likely to get.There are moments of greatness, to be sure. The vicious boxing scenes have left many a viewer punch-drunk, and a few images are guaranteed to sear themselves onto your retina. Even though _Killer's Kiss_ as a whole is less than satisfying, it's well worth a look, especially for Kubrick fans."
5,Kubick's direction saves this one,Poor Stanley. He got stuck with a pretty lame script for this one. Lucky for him he's possibly the most brilliant director ever. His beautiful shooting in this picture would keep an audience thrilled even with an Eszterhas script. This film is a short sweet morsel of joy.
3,"From small things, big things grow!","Despite a limited budget, some average acting at times, one can see the potential that Stanley Kubrick had start to develop into a career of ground breaking and influential filming. The things that stand out in the film include;- Reverse negative shot of the nightmare anticipates the famous ""trip"" scene in 2001;- Voyerism shots reminds a bit of Rear Window;- Huge shadows reflected on the buildings, similar to The Third Man;- The boxing sequence as good as any around that time;- The final fight to the death amongst the dummies was highly capably staged and filmed;- The seediness of the late night New York stands out;- The chase over the roof tops and the alley ways well edited and flows well.Ignore a bit of corny dialogue, this is where Stanley's brilliant creative genius as a film-maker really begins."
1,zzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Kubrick's second feature is a noir nadir: one ugly, awkward, somniferous crime (void of) drama in the vein of a octogenarian's home come Thanksgiving. Highlights of my lifespan's longest hour include rigid, insipid performances, slapdash editing and a narrative surfeited of immaterial, supererogatory exposition that far exceeds (and inevitably eclipses) a lean and shopworn plot. Only a penultimate scene proves distinctive for its fight sequence, ineptly executed by the standards of exploitation fare. Kubrick's dissatisfaction with his antecedent debut Fear and Desire prompted him to withdraw it from public screenings; had he done likewise with this supreme exercise in tedium, no one save completist enthusiasts of American cinema's most autocratic auteur might vocalize misgivings in concern of its inaccessibility by curtailment.This picture's theatrical tagline reads: ""Her Soft Mouth Was the Road to Sin-Smeared Violence!"" Yuck!"
1,killer's kiss,"what s stinkeri guess every director has to start somewhereand i guess this was STANLEY KUBRICKS starterwhich was the only reason i bought iti now have all of his films in my collectionbut let's be brutally honest here it stnckwith a capital ""S""i will say i'm gladmr kubrick seemed to haved llearnedfrom his no plot crappy or dare i say itok i will no story what soeverok the only thing about the moviethat resembled a story was the endingwhen the killer ""kissed"" hisgirlfreindi guess thats where the title comes from"
2,Kubrick fan,this movie didn't really provide a good story line or plot....I was very disappointed with it. No surprises here I was expecting more
3,Pleasantly entertaining.,"If I am a little underwhelmed by this CD it's not because the performances or recording qualities are poor, no it's simply that I prefer a little more finesse and piquancy than is provided here. In general these are moderate, well-made accounts that may lack the distinction of the very best (Dutoit leads my list) but are nevertheless recommendable in their competency. I do think the selection of works is nice, instead of the ""D&C Suite #2"", we get the slightly less played 1st Suite. The much more rare ""song cycle"" ""Sheherzade"" is also quite welcome and receives a fine performance by Gisella Pasino. Overall a nicely entertaining package."
5,It works for me!,"I had spent a number of hours searching the internet for a windshield covers for my two cars. I had passed this item by on a number of occasions in view of the ""SNOW"" issue as my vehicles would not likely have that problem.I was looking for something to simply keep dust, dirt and moisture at bay as my vehicles are stored under a carport very near the ocean. The cover works beautifully in our southern California Santa Ana Winds.I ordered the Jumbo cover for my Honda Odyssey and the regular sized one for my Honda Fit. I could not be more pleased! VERY MUCH worth the money spent.It takes less than a minute to put them on. We don't even bother with the little suction cups supplied. We just close the doors onto the ""ears"" and they stay on good and tight! It is easy to fold and store. I simply wipe them off each time I wash the cars. Great product!"
3,not a bad item,Not bad for the price. Works at 19 degrees and seems to keep the ice and snow off the windshield. The only negative was the attachment to the inside windshield. I did not have the strength to fasten. But still worked well without.
5,Car Snow Cover,"A must to have....When you need to get going whether a light frost or a heavy snow, you will be a very happy camper with this product in the morning you are in a hurry to get going."
4,Windshield cover working as summer cover,"This cover is doing the basic cover job I needed this summer for my RVon a Ford 350. The suction cups work in the heat of the summer althoughsome previous reviewers wrote that they didn't work for the winter. I dowish that the cover was a bit wider top to bottom to completely cover fromthe top of the windshield to the grill work below the windshield wipers. I don't know how well this thin cover would hold up to winter's heavy ice/snow conditions but all I wanted was to protect the windshield when my RV is parked for prolonged periods. For the price, its working."
1,Not Jumbo,"This was supposed to be a ""jumbo"" sized windshield cover, intended to cover up larger van windows. The picture even shows a woman putting the cover on her van window. When we got it, we tried it on the van and it did not cover any more than the standard windshield cover we already had. Comparing the size to our standard cover, it was a hair larger, but it still did not cover the entire windshield as described. Also the quality was poor. I could have just bought a piece of plastic tarp and cut it to fit the windshield and I would have had something better. I returned it to Amazon."
2,Jumbo is a joke,"Jumbo to me means that it should fit on a Lumina Van windshield nicely but it doesn't. It would be a great product if it were bigger. First of all when on the Lumina APV windshield, there is about 4 to 6 inches on the top and the bottom that doesn't even get covered. And for the length...it's not even long enough to suction cup to the inside of the windshield. I have to just put one end in the door and shut it and pull the other end and try to tighten the slack out of it and shut the door without smashing my fingers. It works where it is covered though. The suction cups that come with it stink. They don't work when cold, so just go to walmart and buy the medium sized suction cups with hook (3 to a pack) and remove the hooks and put those on. They work much better."
3,Is Nutrition the answer?,"I had this book and lost it, so replaced it when my sister was diagnosed with cancer. I really think that nutrition is the answer to disease. However, I found out that the author died of cancer! Either she didn't follow her own teaching, or it didn't work for her! Bummer!"
5,Maureen's Books,She's a great help and encourager in health matters and was a national/international leader in making it possible for the consumer to access the minerals and vitamins. She really dedicated her life to helping people.
3,"Pretty, but small","After reading the Wall Street Journal article on the Hanky Panky business, I, like a lot of others, ordered these. And although they are pretty, they're not all that stretchy -- if you're a size 4, 6, 8, you'll probably like these, but they're not a great fit for a size 12 or more."
1,"One Size Does NOT Fit ""All""...","I have loved my HP's in the past. I had numerous pairs and wore them often. I bought the big 5 pack because they were so great. I am 5'5"" and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy...ugh, what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back...why in the world they don't offer sizes is beyond me..."
5,perfect fit and rise!,"I am a size 8 and middle aged I love thongs because they are generally comfy and leave a smooth silhouette. But lately all the thongs I find are low rise. I wanted some mid rise thongs for a leaner look. These panties provide that, but they still are fun and sexy. The lace is soft too. I hate scratchy lace. I am now buying the 5 pack!"
4,Love the fit of the Hanky Panky thong,"I have been wearing Hanky Panky for a few years and continue to be satisfies with the fit and comfort as well as the look. A bit pricey, I think, but that seems to be about the cost of nice thongs found in department stores."
3,ok item,Not very substantial; I usually wear a medium (size 6) but this seemed small. Probably best for a devoted thong wearer which I am not.
4,Imperanon,"Here we have Imperanon's, first full-length album, Stained. Imperanon is a melodic-death metal band from Finland. They have a standard, run-of-the-mill Finnish sound, but add in a neo-classical twist; much like Children of Bodom's older releases. The guitar riffing is very noodlely and power metal-esque. Fast pace solos and well thought out melodies. The vocals are much like Petri Lindroos', as a matter of fact, the singer from Imperanon just replaced Petri in Norther. There are also a couple of guest appearances from which add to the power metal sound. The Keyboards are also well heard and stand out, and there is a lot of variation with them as well. The rhythm section is spot on melodic death metal at its finest. It is a worthy release and if your into COB or Finnish metal, neo-classical, and anything with virtuoso playing i would defiantly recommend this album."
3,To say they idol Children of Bodom is an understatement.,"These guys can play very well, but Imperanon sound like (old) Children's of Bodom's younger brother, even down to the vocals. Would have been great if it had a shred of originality."
2,not what is pictured,"I didn't mind what I received. It was a wooden letter. I just don't know why a different ornament is pictured. I wanted to return them since I bought a bunch for my daughter and other relatives for Christmas but it was less than 2 dollars, i figured what the heck. Put the right picture of the product you are selling please!"
5,Ear refreshment,"Some listeners will recognize every single phrase and drum lick in spite of the fact that George Martin and son have masterfully reworked the Beatles' catalog into a new tapestry of sound. There were two or three moments the origin of which I was not entirely certain, but my ancient ears were delightfully refreshed by the new juxtaposition of ""old favorites"" from the music of my youth. Knowing that this recording was created with visuals in mind, it's easy to imagine it as a soundtrack for a Cirque de Soleil performance, but it also stands alone as a sonic experience. Listeners new to the Beatles music (Are there any?) should be grateful for such a rich introduction. For them this is like a Greatest Hits compilation of historic moments in Beatle history. For those of us who memorized every song for a decade, this is more than a meandering down memory lane - it is a chance to have a new experience with old friends."
5,George Martin and his son did a FANTASTIC job!!,"I have been a Beatles fan for many years, when they were together and when they were apart, especially of George Harrison. When I read the description and reviews of this CD on Amazon.com, I had to hear it for myself. Now, I can't stop playing it! I love the way the Martins have made the songs flow from one to another, and individualized portions of them. There are certain songs where either the vocal tracks have been upped or some of the intrumental tracks have been left out, and you hear and realize again the magnificent harmony the Beatles had! My only desire now is to find a copy of the Cirque du Soleil Love on DVD - (I don't think it exists yet) - cause I'm going crazy trying to figure out what kind of moves they do to this music!!! I don't think it would have been half this good if anybody other than Martin had worked on it - he really knew the Beatles' stuff and how to treat it!"
5,Did not dissapoint.,Loved this cd.I was worried that it would be a bunch of junk remixes.But I was not dissapointed at all.Even my father who passed down his love of the Beatles to me was impressed.A must buy if you love the Beatles.
5,This is the version to get,"First things first, Love by the Beatles, features music that is all from the Beatles original recordings. That said, the starting point for this CD is very strong. If you can get past the fact that there are what amounts to remixes of many of the recordings. I am a firm believer that any music by the Beatles is great music. Love by the Beatles is no exception to that belief. The sound hear is outstanding. There are many of the classic Beatles songs hear, with some eerie renditions and some excellent. There is an ethereal quality to Strawberry Fields and I am the Walrus sounds excellent. This is a must have for Beatles fans. I rate it a strong four stars.The Audio DVD that comes with this special version sounds so outstanding on surround sound, it elevates this 4 star CD to a 5 star must have. The music sounds perfect."
4,Brings some classics back to life,"You've heard all these songs a thousand times before, but never like this. The fun of ""Love"" is twofold - deconstructing the very clever overlays of different tracks, and hearing some of the best pop music ever recorded remastered to perfection. As others have noted, the sound quality on this CD is amazing, and begs the question -- why not remaster the whole catalog too?Hardly a false step here -- could have been much more adventurous, but definitely worth the money."
2,"""LOVE"" ain't all we need....","This is really just a one-listen curio dolled-up as ""Beatles Lite: For Lovers"", aimed squarley at The SoccerMom and DiaperDad set. What Sir George needs to do NOW, however, is stop the AdultContempo naval-gazing (nothin' but lint, pal), and drop dem straight remasters of the Beatles Canon, poste-haste. Dig?"
1,Stars on 45?,By all means try to get the best quality out of these recordings but why mix two or more songs together into a pointless medly.This is only slightly better than Stars on 45.
5,Beatle Fan,This is a wonderful remaster of the Beatles recordings. This is the same soundtrack used at the Cir De Solei Show at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. We were surprised with a live stage show of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. Great show and great music.
3,"It is what you'd expect, no more, no less","Even if somebody could out-Beatle the Beatles, it would never sound entirely legitimate anyway.Giles Martin has done an admirable feat splicing together numerous Beatles bits and bobs. At times the mix is a mess, most often when he tries to mash one tune with another. The results are more enjoyable in the juxtapositions. The most brilliant moment? The way ""For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite"" runs into the end of ""She's So Heavy"". Heavy! John would have been tickled pink.Altogether, a fun listen, but nothing you'd ever really get into. And that's what we're looking for in music, isn't it?"
3,Excellent sound quality - missed my mark,"This is a remarkable production - using existing ""Beatles performed"" music in a very creative set of mixes that seem a perfect match to a Cirque du Soleil show. The multi-channel sound quality is excellent and many of the songs are really eye-openers for an old Beatles fan (literally - I graduated high school in 1965). But the Cirque aspect is, for me, also the drawback and so the album missed ""my mark"". There were bits and pieces of songs that I wanted to hear full-length, and a bit too much of the later work or instumental (re)mixes for my taste. I previewed the album and if I had heard the whole thing it would still be in my collection - I just wish there were more ""songs"" and a bit less ""music"". For anyone who likes the Beatles - it's a worthwhile investment, just don't expect to sing along..."
2,the point??,"Being an avid Beatles listener, I was curious about what this would sound like when it came out. Let's just say that the version of While My Guitar Gently Weeps is nice. Other than that, I see nothing unique about Love other than a haphazard combination of random songs and studio [...]. Can anyone explain the actual point of this album??"
5,Forever Beatle Fan,George Martin and his son did a beautiful job putting this authorized CD together. If you are a true Beatle fan this CD is a must for your collection.
4,Barry,"If you are a Beatles fan you will love this album. The surround sound, if not 'spectacular' is still 'great'. I recommend this album to anyone who is already a fan, or who is interested is listening to some good History making music.Barry."
5,Beatles Extravaganza,"Simply stated, this album is remarkable. As the liner notes attest, the sound reflects the extraordinary talent of a ""young band"" that merely changed the world. With an articulate and masterful touch from George and Giles Martin, the mixing of so many outstanding Beatles songs into such a cohesive ""set"" leads you to believe you are listening to a magnificent new body of work from the group. A fresh and amazing approach to songs that have filled my life for the past 40 plus years."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"This CD is not the fantastic, crazy mash-up we've all been waiting for. I eagerly picked this up, thinking somebody had done something weird and wonderful with all those classic tunes, and honestly I couldn't tell the difference in probably half the songs. Sure, maybe some lyrics are slightly different, maybe the music has been moved around, but most of these tracks could be outtakes from the original sessions. Either the mixer isn't all that creative or they just didn't take the time.There's a brilliant mash-up Beatles CD lurking somewhere in the future. This, unfortunately, isn't it."
2,Love - The Beatles,"One man's opinion, so please take it as such. I grew up with the Beatles, and as a avid fan of the Beatles I can appreciate their music in almost any format, however . . . If you appreciate the genius and artisty of the Beatles, and can never seem to get enough, get yourself the real thing in its original form. If you appreciate show tunes, get yourself show tunes. Love is a mixture of both, and in my opinion fails at both. I never thought I'd think it, let alone express it, but this is a blatant attempt to exploit Beatle music in order to make a few more bucks. As a collection of bits and pieces of Beatles music that was perfect in the original, but remixed here to give it a new look, it fails miserably. Do what you want, but given a second chance, I would avoid it."
5,Full of Love,"George Martin and his son, Giles, have put a lot of love into this recording. And who better than to enhance the original recordings than George Martin, the fifth Beatle. The new recordings maintain the integrity of the originals while giving them fresh, beautifully nuanced interpretations. I was apprehensive about this recording before I put it in the CD player, but have grown to appreciate the overall work. I do believe the later recordings by the Beatles, beginning with the Revolver album, work better with the multi-layered sound but the earlier recordings come across much richer. The vocals have a clarity that are moving, especially ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps."" This CD is worthy to belong in anyone's Beatles collection."
3,why so expensive?,"Why is this 38$? I wanted to get it for my dad's christmas present, but the shipping time was 5-7 weeks so I went to Borders and found it on sale for $14.99. The Special edition with the DVD was $24. Why is it so expensive on amazon?"
5,Love It!,"I'm a lifelong Beatles fan and I wholeheartedly recommend ""Love."" The sound quality is awesome; Giles and George Martin did a great job. I've been listening over and over -- and can't wait to see the Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas."
3,Mixed collection could have used DJ Danger Mouse,"Everyone has about 42 versions of all of the songs on this album but it nevertheless presents a fresh take on songs we know by heart. The remixes and alternate takes vary tremendously in effectiveness, with some virtually indistinguishable from the original. Others -- notably ""Get Back"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" -- provide provocative new spins.Anyone familiar with ""The Gray Album"" knows how effectively the Beatles can be used as samples -- Jay Z's ""99 Problems"", as remixed by Danger Mouse, is a great example -- but this collection doesn't sustain that level of creativity."
1,Sorry me! Poor me! I bought it.... This is not worth a penny.. ok maybe one,I'm a huge Beatles Fan.... I grew up singing their songs while in the car with my mom. This CD might sound great on stage with Cirque du Soleil but at work at my desk it really sucks... give me the real songs full lenght and original. This mish mash of sound has nothing but made me want to hold to my old cds..Great songs in this CD but terrible mix...
1,Very deciving describtion,"This is not the Beatles, it is a CD made for ""Cirque do Soleil"" it shoudn't be presented as a Beatles CD because the buyer will expect the songs as they heard them originally, not in this form"
4,The Beatles are great --- and you can make your own mix!,"Dear All,I love the Beatles. We all know at certain times love songs hurt and we wish we could sail away on the Yellow Subarmine ,our answer being LET IT BE, and we IMAGINE for a day to get better. We are beyond TRYING TO WORK IT OUT<I DONT SEE IT YOUR WAY etc. This is why I say buy the Beatles from Amazon of course, in the original recordings. Download them to your IPOD or other freiendly MP3 player aand make your own song list or more than one to meat the needs of all of your moods and passions. You should hear my 75 song Christmas play list, a marvel and a joy to have. Joy to the world, make your own. My other playlists all serve a purpose and if I have no purpose I can always hit the shuffle and be suprised!"
2,DVD has no video,"The DVD shows the album cover and apparently has no video, just the music in a different surround sound format. Disappointing.JH"
2,NOT THE REAL BEATLES,"Impressionist group - not bad, BUT when you are expecting the REAL BEATLES, it doesn't compare.AMAZON needs to make it clear UP FRONT that this is an impressionist group."
2,Not for Beatles fans,"If your a Beatles fan your not going to like this as it remixes so many of the songs together, its like a montage rather than a album. I Imaging those who are new to the Beatles or saw the Cirque du Soleil show will enjoy."
1,It's pretty bad,"They finally release The Beatles in a High Fidelity format and what do we get a Megamix.....snippets of Beatle songs. For a lot of you DJ's out there you know how we hate Megamixes. Come on Apple Records, EMI, Parlophone whoever has the power, do it while we are still alive. The Beatles in it's true form on DVD-Audio, DTS ...... that would be amazing."
2,Martin adds his greasy thumbprint. Why????,"Okay- The scene(albeit fictitous)is a graveyard. Dr. Martinstein and son Giles dig up the graves of John and George, open their caskets, and ask permission to completely 'mess' with their completed works. 'They didnt say 'no'!' is Martin's decision, closing the lids! Thus this product. Okay, clever, well done, great sound (yawn), but WHY??????????????This is akin to cutting up family photographs just to insert one's own face. I think it's abysmal, if only for intent. Why Ringo and Paul would ever sanction this is a mystery to me. I got it for Christmas, but it'll most likely end up on ebay, as i aint gonna open it!"
4,Love,"I liked this CD so much I went back and bought another for a friend. If you like the Beatles' music (and who doesn't, really?), and have always been curious about what modern technology could do to it, buy Love. Some people may think you shouldn't mess with a classic, but I say why not experience it both ways. I'll ride on the back of a horse, but I also drive a car."
5,Shows that you can mess with perfection,"Sometimes, you have to be willing to take a chance with perfection. If it ain't broke, don't fix it is a good motto to live by, but the great artists have all been willing to think outside the box. George Martin took something we all know and turned it on its head. We're all better for it."
1,an irritating mess,"First of all, I love a good mashup. DJ Dangermouse did a great job combining the Beatles and Jay-Z. But nobody should get away with taking existing perfection and trying to make it ""slicker"". George Martin had to have known on some level this was a pander to far. To hear the start of a song you have always loved, then hear it has been monkeyed with for a new cash grab by the label is putrid."
5,An unforgettable listening experience,"""Love"" is not just another Beatles album, it is an unforgettable listening experience. This is as close as we will ever get to a new Beatles recording. I wish I had a way to contact Sir George Martin and Giles Martin. I would like to personally thank them for what they have done. Every time I listen to this ""Love"" I feel like I am 16 years old again.To all the purists who are screaming foul: Paul and Ringo love this CD, so why should anyone else complain? If you don't like it, don't listen to it."
4,Beatles,"Haven't listened much to the Beatles in a while, though they were once a mainstay. I have really really enjoyed this CD. It's magical."
4,Pause for thought!,"Well, the fans are really divided about this one. As a lifelong Beatles fan I have to say that I think it's worth $10 of anyone's money, but it will mean more to people who appreciate the Beatles significance in the history of popular music. What struck me most about this CD was the incredible improvement in sound quality over previous releases - for example, the bass lines are so clear but so are all the other instruments and voices. If nothing else it gets you thinking and wondering what the Beatles would have sounded like if they had had today's sound recording and reproduction technology all those years ago. They couldn't improve on the quality of the songs themselves - just the way they were recorded and reproduced. And that is what 'Love' does so well!"
5,I think it sounds great!!!!,"I am not huge Beatles fan by any stretch, but I do like good music and this certainly suffices that premise. There are versions of songs that are light years sonically better than the originals and then the mashing that the Martins use is usually spot on. Makes for a pleasant trip, hearing their ""hits"" along with tracks that are just as essential. I recommend it, buy it for yourself and maybe a few for some of your music listening friends who are hedging on buying this. Good stuff."
5,"Heard it was Great, it was a Gift from Me",My son and grandson both love The Beatles and so this was a gift for Christmas to them. I personally have not listened to this yet but will when I return home for the summer. Both told me they loved this so this is the best I can do.
5,Amazon Never got it to me,"Definitely can't wait to get this, but the problem isn't the product, its the fact that Amazon shipped it to the wrong address, it was returned, but they never credited my account nor shipped it again despite customer service calls to fix this, so I find it a bit ironic now that their automated process is asking me for a review for a product they have not yet delivered (1 month later). :("
4,Watch Cirque du Soleil and listen to The Beatles !,"If you truly like Beatles' music there's no need to buy this CD (no new music !), instead listen to the original music as it was released in the 60s on vinyl, and, later on, remastered on CD. Use a computer to create your own mixing, and, as I did, add post-Beatles material from each of the Fab Four solo career. Of course, the ""Love"" DVD Audio version offers 5.1 multi channel sound, but, believe me, the vinyl's Mono version is all I need !Buy this CD after you watched Cirque du Soleil's oustanding show to remind you of it. The show - it's the only way to ""watch"" The Beatles now ! Great show, great music - 'will last forever !"
2,Unadventurous and very disappointing.,"For a long time, I savored the idea of picking this album up and giving it a good, long listen. I thought, oh maybe this will be fun and even a bit mindblowing, getting to hear the Beatles catalog really given a thorough reworking from the great George Martin, the man most familiar with its inner workings...Sadly, not.This is a profoundly unadventurous record, with only one or two real moments of inspiration. Compared to earlier Beatles mash-ups such as John Oswald's long-suppressed sampling remixes or the Beatles/Jay-Z ""Gray Album,"" this record is simply boring and effete, a simplistic pastiche draped around a few good parlour tricks, but nothing to get worked up about. The mix of ""Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows"" is a bit brilliant, but almost everything else is rather tame and ultimately dull. Oh, well. Maybe a few decades from now, after the copyright runs out, we can really get wild with this music."
4,Mixing good but effects suck,"This is a good selection and a good mix, but there are a couple of little things that are quite annoying.1) Why do we have to hear a British police siren before 'I Am the Walrus'?2) Why oh why oh WHY do we have those idiot Liverpool voices at the end? These voices are NOT the Beatles, NOR are they genuine Liverpool accents.To the educated ear these effects are like finger nails on a blackboard, and totally unnecessary.Overall though an interested new mix of classic Beatles and worth having."
3,"Great new band, shows potential","This album shows great promise. While some of the material is a little uneven, relying heavily on 60's brit-style pop, overall it is an enjoyable listen. I hope this band goes onto record more original material as they have the ability to grow to into a real powerhouse."
5,Very good,"Remember, the beatles hardly performed as a band. Their music is mostly a bunch of edited tracks. A good way to see this is as a different edit. All of the beatles best songs appear on this. It's a greatest hits done right."
1,Save Your Money- Don't Buy It,Absolutely abysmal CD. The remaining Beatles should sue. It was a stretch to give this item one star.
2,That rustling sound in some of the tracks is the money leaving your wallet,"I beg to differ. This is a rip-off. The CD remixes may be masterful, but one has the sense that a bright 14 year old with Garageband could do something much like this. Most annoying is the DVD. Expecting old footage, or even something from Cirque du Soleil--after all, the liner notes tell you that that's the premise for this thing? Guess again. There's a single image that remains onscreen for the duration of album, an image that stays before you as you presumably wallow around on your floor marveling at the Surround-sounded remix. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss twenty bucks good-bye."
3,The Only Thing That Might Be Better...,"Hyped? Yes. Great listening experience? Surprisingly, yes, it's all that. My first thoughts here - being more of a West Coast Surfer Dude musically - are these; Brian (and Melinda) Wilson, are you listening? A similar treatment to the work of the Beatles competing Capitol Tower inhabitants, The Beach Boys (current Mike Love legalities withstanding), would likely put this to shame - even tho' there is no Vegas show to base it on. Same approach could be taken - focus on the more accessible pop-based tunes, harmonies and melodies of the group's later (late 60's, 70's) work, just as the Martin project did here. Brian - embrace your legacy and surpass this with your superior genius! SMiLE II?"
2,Beatles,I don't like the treatment given to the songs. It's better to just buy the regular Beatles number one hits.
3,Yeah Yeah Yeah but...,"Don't waste your money on the CD/DVD two-fer, which is ridiculous. The ""DVD"" is just a duplicate of the audio disc with a severely lame graphics display tacked on. Can't imagine why they bothered."
4,An audio collage indeed,"Having virtually every album the Beatles made (that were available in the U.S.), I never had a doubt that they were the best pop musicians in the world. I remember my 70 year old grandmother bouncing to the tune ""Love me do,"" as she was ironing. This album is a type of closure for me, for I grew up with the Beatles. I was 12 when JFK was assassinated (1963), and the world was in a dark hole, mentally and spiritually. Then the Beatles seemed to appear from nowhere. They were like voices from above that reassured us everything was going to be alright, and that ""Love"" truly was the answer. Unfortunately, like other universal themes, its message still escapes humanity, but its nice to know we have a time capsule in this album we can revisit in our own way and appreciate what the Beatles did for us with their obvious talent (ahead of its time) and timeless message."
4,Beatles via Cirque du Soleil,"The Beatles / Love: Before I say anything else, you do know that this is a reworking and editing of classic Beatles songs created for a Cirque du Soleil performance, right? I only ask because, apparently (judging from the 1 and 2 star reviews on this page) there are over 80 incredibly dull persons who bought this disk and then complained that this wasn't an `original' Beatles hit disc. Please, if your looking for a greatest hits disc, this is NOT it. Now, as to this George Martin re-imagining of the Beatles songs to fit into this `circus' performance, It's really very entertaining and refreshing. I enjoyed the music very much. Good job Mr. Martin! It's not a masterpiece (as it was created for a circus) but it is worth hearing and owning.Four Stars."
4,"Beatles ""LOVE""",I would have given this product 5 stars because the music composition and arrangement and its correspondence to the Cirque was just phenomenal. I have never heard this type of arrangement before with the Beatles library of music and it was very interesting. I love listening to it. The drawback to this particular product was the DVD portion. If I would have known its content I would have only purchased the CD. The DVD only shows the album cover on your TV screen while you listen to the same music that is on the CD. I thought there would be at least some sort of slide show from the Cirque or something more to the DVD than merely one picture of the album cover and music. I still love the music though.
3,Beatles Love,The tape was missing the song that I purchased it for - Black Bird. There were a few notes from the song and then it went into another song. The album is great - just disappointed that the song I purchased it for is missing.
3,Thought it would be better...,"Sorry, but this one I probably could have done on my own computer with a decent music editing program, the concept is genius as is most of the Beatles music but it's really nothing we haven't heard before.Maybe the key to really enjoying this contribution is to actually see the Cirque de Soleil show in Vegas."
5,A Great New Collection,This CD is great. I saw the show in Vegas and itbrinngs back great memories. The sound quality isexcellent!!
4,Best song on the CD....,"...is the absolutely beautiful arrangement of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". I saw the show in Las Vegas and was immediately captivated by this new arrangement. I'd always liked the ""White Album"" version, but this one just melted my heart. When I listen to the CD, I always end up hitting the replay button at least once to listen to it again. The harmonies in the strings are just breathtakingly beautiful. Kudos to whoever is responsible for this new Beatles treasure. The show itself is wonderful. After it was over, I realized my cheeks ached a little because I just couldn't stop smiling! Even my husband, who is rarely swept away by ANYTHING, used the word ""fantastic"" when we were talking about it."
4,makes me look forward to remasters,"I bought this when it came out and frankly I put it away I could not stand the rehash of Beatles music< I thought John and George must be turning in their graves because the way the original songs were messed up for this stupid show. When I learned that the remaster would be coming in Sept 09, I got the cd out again and listened using my headphones and was blown away by the clarity of the music, it's as if it had been recorded recently using state of the art equipment. Now I cannot wait to hear all this great music without all the raping it was put through. ps if you have a DVD-A player with 6ch input in your receiver then use that mode instead it's a lot better than plain dvd or cd"
2,Imagine Something Over Hyped and Not Imaginative,"I'm highly disappointed after hearing all the hype. I can't believe it bought into it. I make fun of my husband for buying all the ""new"" Doors CDs. Like ""Light my Fire"" is great, but how many versions do you need. Likewise with Lady Madonna and Hey Jude. Once was enough. I wasted my money on this effort. Well, at least, it has a new Strawberry Fields Forever. That's my consolation. Wait for it in the cut out bin."
3,not worth buying,"I have been a moderate Beatles fan all of my life. My i-tunes has a very large beatles list. This disk was bought for me as a Christmas presant( I should say 'these disks' since it is a dual set)...I listened to the whole thing carefully, expecting something different. There are a few small bits which you can get if you listen REALLY carefully, but it is the same on the whole. Someone re-mixed the songs for LENGTH. This IS NOT a ""new"" version of the Beatles. It's mixed to fit the length and excitement of the Circe D'Soleil routines.Please don't get caught up in the hype..it is the same except for a few forgetable moments..however, it is a wonderful mix of Beatles tunes."
3,interesting...to a point,"more of a ""novelty"" than anything else.Interesting for one listening,but that's about all.Absolutely love THE BEATLES,but this is not what I'll be reaching for when I want to hear the best music ever made."
4,Bob Gitzen,"I loved this reimagining of the Beatles but I've got a question that I hope someone could answer. When I play the DVD-audio disc on my DVD-audio player (on a stereo system) I'm given no option to listen to a high resolution stereo mix. I thought a seperate Hi-res stereo track was required. When I put the disc in a regular DVD player the ""audio"" option pops up and I can choose PCM stereo. But not on my DVD-A player (Yamaha DVD-C750). Every other disc I own has a hi-res stereo option offered in ""setup"". No such ""bullet point"" appears on the Yamaha for this disc. Is Apple ignoring the rules, or am I wrong about that."
3,Where are the listening samples?,"I agree with the many others who are displeased that Amazon etc did not offer consumers listening samples of this album. I agree with those who feel that Sir George Martin and son should have taken it even further, wilder. I'd like to hear the Beatles FUNKED up! Bring in (sir) George Clinton on the next Beatles remix project!"
5,Love the Beatles,"The sound quality of this CD exceeds expectations! The blend, harmony, and clarity of sound are excellent!"
3,Love kicked out Across the Universe.......,"""Across the Universe"" with sitar vesion in Anthology dvd is So Beauty!! I think they should put it into this hi-fi sound like-new Album.... Hey Jude, you'd understand what I mean ......"
1,Mo' money.,"I did grow up in the 60s, but even if I hadn't, I could recognize this CD as another way to milk the Beatle name for mo' money. I'm not a purist by heart, I'm not upset by this CD release, and taking chances is necessary to explore new musical depths, but this fails. This CD was a gift, and so I guess it's the thought that counts; the buyer knows the Beatles are number one in my opinion. I won't tell them if you won't, but if they want to borrow it and forget to give it back, I won't remind them, either. I'll have it handy when they come to visit, both to tempt them to borrow it and to let them know I haven't thrown it out."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,This is not a greatest hits album---I should have read the reviewsbefore purchasing---I do not care for the way the material is presented
3,Not too keen,"The songlist looked amazing, but the effect of this reminds me of ""Stars on 45"" - ie. a medley - rather than the songs I'd liked. Yes, the Beatles tracks have been enhanced but I guess I'm a traditionalist and didn't quite enjoy this treatment, which detracts and distracts for me. Would I enjoy it with the Cirque show? Probably. But I prefer my Beatles unadorned."
4,Feel the power of sixties !,"This a CD it can take you back 40 years in just one minute. Beautiful music, powerful music.You just have to close your eyes and feel the rhythm !"
3,More reloaded Beatles Music,"Maybe if you had the opportunity to see the Cirque du Soleil spectacle, this Cd can be a good ""souvenir"". If you hadn't (like me),be sure you are a Beatles die hard fan (like me) before you buy it. If you are an average fan, let it go."
1,This is pretty awful.,"This mishmash should have been titled ""Mucking Around With Some Beatles Songs."" The basic music is some of the excellent music of the Beatles, which has been with us now for a very long time. It appeared to be a good idea to someone to sample pieces of a lot of songs and then mix them in and out of each other to make something. Unfortunately, it comes out as cobbled and patched, with unsatisfying abbreviations of many songs, and jumps between songs which are mostly jarring. The songs themselves each had beauty, integrity and even dignity. This collection sounds like a bad motel lounge singer's routine. I can discern no sense or purpose in this album, except the continuing need for money from which the Beatles empire suffers. This is a ""must-not-have"" for Beatles fans, and if anyone out there doesn't have the original recordings, I'd save my money and buy them instead."
5,The Best Beatles Studio Remaster Ever!,"I ""Love"" it! This could be the best re-compilation of music ever. I bought the Love album thinking it was just another re-cut of Beatles music.When I first realized that it was a rework, I made up my mind fast...not to like it. I was pleasantly surprised, though, after listening to it completely through a couple times...while on a road trip.These two gentlemen put out an impressive piece of work with many creative, seamless, transitions... and it has become one my favorite Beatles album overnight.Sounds great through the car stereo too! That's a really important consideration when investing in music that you may already have in some form.Next on the agenda...I hope! The Doors, The Stones, Cream, Bee Gees, Moody Blues, Queen...whomever, they may want to tackle next. I'll be looking forward to more of their work."
1,The Beatles F.U.B.A.R.,"I'm an original die-hard Beatles fan, grew up with them in the 60s; I still think that The Beatles are the most innovative and age-defining band of the Rock and Roll era. No other band had such creativity and diversity in their sound throughout their short but timeless successful career. I had all of their original vinyl albums, cassettes and now all of their CDsThis ""Love"" album manages to take true classic Beatles music, needlessly create medlies and mix together random soundtracks to make a true mockery of their creative music genius. I cringed while listening to this truely aweful CD except when the mucic was recognizable as the original music. If this is what the future holds for new Beatles releases, then I will never buy another Beatles album again, unless it's to replace a missing or damaged classic.If you don't know what F.U.B.A.R. means, ask any military veteran."
1,Garbage Can Please,"I have been a Beatle's fan since 1964. i saw them in concert in 1966. I own every Beatles album in existance as well as the matching CD for today's digital world. In my opinion they are the best that has ever been or will be.I received the ""Love"" CD for Christmas and have been looking for a discreet garbage can to deposit it into ever since. This is by far the WORST Beatle's collection I have ever owned and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason."
1,No no no no no no no,"Given one by my daughter, so not paid for. Bloody weird. Like a halucination of the Beatles. Cant be bothered trying to name all the bits. They all are recognisable, but....why? When you think in terms of Las Vegas it just becomes awful. Where are the woolly rough edges? The bits that went wrong but sounded great. Like Twist and Shout. This is a digitally perfect horrowshow. A George Martin dream of what he would have done at the time. But being done now, it's Lloyd Webberish gibberish. And as for Octopuses Garden.... God help us. The only comparison is Wordsworth chucking out all his youthful visons of nature in favour of his revisionist old age cant (sic).I think Lennon would have booted it into touch. Well they wouldn't have had to do it would they, if he were still around. Just got Macca in a headlock and written some new stuff...- Derek Taylor"
1,Blasphemous,"This release is a blasphemous release. It butchers the Beatles' music in ways I could never have nightmares about. It is an uncreative, pointless album. Most of the songs play as normal, with a few interspersed samples from other songs thrown in for good measure. It's like they didn't even try to create huge differences, so it isn't even that creative. Furthermore, the remixes completely ripped the soul out of the music as originally intended. It rips out some of the best parts of songs, such as the end of Revolution or the chorus at the end of Hey Jude. It uses the crescendo sample from A Day in the Life far too much. In a nutshell, it massacres and dessicates the way these songs should be heard. If you MUST hear this music, copy a friend's CD, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Doesn't fit the title,"Not what I thought it would be, and the recordings don't sound like the original hits."
3,Nothing Unusual,I like the Beatles but this was nothing new or exciting. Good songs but not that good.
2,Disappointing,This could hae been awesome but they tried to do too much. Sun King backwards??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? Give me a break! That is totally ridiculous and an insult to the Beatles legacy. About half of this works (and the sound is magnificent) and the other half belongs in the garbage. Avoid.
1,Awful,This was given to me as a gift. I believed it to be another hits collection. I found out that George Martin and son had fricked-up some of the greatest rock n roll music in the world. Why would anyone tamper with what was one of the greatest song writing teams and music groups that was the Beatles. If George Martin needs money I'll send him twenty bucks but please leave the classics alone.
1,Buy a Geniune Beatle CD instead,"As a collector of Beatle CD's, LP's and 45's with over 4200 items I feel that EMI has really had a good laugh at the collectors expense. This is NOT the way these songs were ever meant to be heard, either from the Beatles or the record companies standpoint. With all the quality music that the Beatles have given us I think I would rather buy the soundtrack from the god awful Beatlemania play. This is capitolism at it's worst. I would of given this 0 stars if allowed but I must admit the sound quality it quite good."
1,John and George are rolling in their graves!,"What is the point to this thing? It is disturbing to listen to, what's next, rap mixes? Disco mixes? I grew up in the 60's, I'm a purist and enjoy the Beatles music as they intended it to be listened to. I can't imagine Paul and Ringo blessed this. Why don't they release the fan club Christmas album? Hey Jude 3:58? I don't think so."
4,Almost classic,"If you're a Beatles fan, you pretty much have to own this album. Unless you're a Beatles purist and don't like hearing the original tunes remixed and messed with in any way. But trust me, the mixes are very interesting and in some cases improvements on the original, seamlessly meshing from one track to another without breaks, sometimes even blending 2 or 3 classics together in a fascinating way. George Martin and the remaining Beatles had a hand in the album, so you know they weren't going to allow any schlock. The reason I didn't give it five stars and title my review ""Absolutely classic"" is because, unfortunately, only about 2/3rds to 3/4ths of the album are new remixes. The rest of the tunes sound like the originals or directly from the Anthology CDs (not necessarily a bad thing). I wanted the entire album to be original. That said, I have no regrets about buying this album. Go for a drive on a sunny day and listen to it from start to finish...you won't be disappointed."
4,A Magical Remix Tour,"If producer George Martin were not involved in the ""Love"" project, I would have avoided this CD like the plague. Happily, Martin (with son Giles) has reimagined the Beatles' catalogue in exciting new ways. The best moments in ""Love"" are the most audacious, such as the seamless remix of ""Drive My Car,"" ""The Word"" and ""What You're Doing"" - not to mention layering the vocal track from ""Within You Without You"" over the instrumentation of ""Tomorrow Never Knows."" Admittedly, some remixes are dispensable (notably ""Because,"" ""Help!"" and ""All You Need Is Love""), yet the overall effect is quite entrancing. As a musical entity, ""Love"" succeeds in erasing the bad taste of 2003's ""Let It Be . . . Naked."""
4,"Inspired, but could have been Sublime","I absolutely love this album, it hasn't left my mp3 player since I bought it! Several of the tracks (Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing, Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter, Here Comes The Sun/The Inner Light) are so good, it almost makes the inner Beatles fan want to giggle :) The transitions are so much fun (often very trippy but somehow still clean) and I love spotting which bits have been put where.. that said, I wish there were more of this in the album. Some of the songs have been very nicely paired down to create a cleaner overall experience, but some of the tracks sound basically exactly the same as the original. If George Martin had just taken a little bit more of a step out of the original tracks, this would have jumped to the top of my favorite Beatles albums! Still great though, definitely worth the buy.."
4,LOVE,I had purchased the Love album before seeing the show in Vegas. After the show I was amazed at how much longer the show was compared to the album. It's a magnificent blend of Beatle's songs done masterfully and enjoyable. I can't say enough about this CD. It's 100% magic!
2,Amazing - I think this is a gem!,"I am an avid Beatles fan and have all their official CD releases and loads of their vinyl. Conseqently I am familiar with their music. This album allows you to hear a different spin on some of their most popular, as well as less well known, music. The segues are fascinating and you will also hear snippets from versions other than the officially released tracks. The mixing has, of course, been done on state of the art equipment and is beautifully crystal clear - top marks to EMI for:1) Impeccable original recordings, and2) Preserving those old recordings so well.The clarity allows you to hear into parts of recordings that were previously 'buried in the mix'.I approached this album in trepidation but I have found myself beguiled. Fans and casual observers alike will definitely enjoys this. Roll out the show in Europe please!"
1,Good sound but there is NO Beatles Spirit!,"Granted - they did a good job to restore original records to quite a good quality, but they added a lot of garbage sounds as well. I hardly listened the record one time till the end. Lucky me, I borrowed CD not bought it! I would not take it even for free now!!!Bottom line: it is artificialy refined to the point of total spiritless though very good quality, original Beatles records reconstruction. Liveliness and pointless..."
3,"Great, but DON'T buy the CD + Audio DVD!","Ok, so LOVE is great. I am in love with it, and can't stop listening to it since I got it, which was like 4 months ago. However, don't buy the dvd edition just because you think you are gonna get to see a small video or something from the actual Las Vegas show. The dvd is nothing but the LOVE background you have on your case, with the song that is playing at the moment. Which makes it a waste of money. But, don't let that discourage you from buying the CD. Cause truly, you are going to fall in LOVE with it. Literally!!! I have never heard anything like it. :) Two thumbs up. Go here, and buy it :Love"
2,Disappointing,I am not a Beatle's purist but I listened to this CD wanting to like it but found it wanting.I felt that it failed as an artistic re-rendering of the Beatle's music and the effort sounded more like a very expensive form of doodling with the original tracks.Very dissappointing effort from George Martin and his son.
4,The music is good...but surround sound woes...,"I've listened to the whole CD, only in plain stereo. The music is pretty good. While, i do enjoy the way they've mixed the songs (and of course the sonic quality), it's a little on the trippy side for me. Nevertheless, still quite good.My problem is that the surround sound is not working for me. The box says Disc 2 will play in ANY DVD player. So, i was under the impression that i can still listen to DTS 5.1 from my regular DVD player...just not the hi-resoultion audio that you get from a DVD-Audio player, right? Well, my DVD player will NOT read the surround info. It keep sending it to my receiver as PCM stereo, and i can't change that. I tested my other DVD's, and they play in DD and DTS just fine.Do i have a defective disc? Has anyone else played in 5.1 on a regular DVD player?"
3,great sound quality; little really new,"I am a major Beatles fan and the walls of my office at work evidence that. After the reading the early reviews talking about a whole new way of hearing the Beatles, I was anticipating this album with great relish. But overall, it is quite underwhelming. The sound quality is magnificent; leaving me frustrated that albums like Abbey Road have not been released in surround sound. But the work of the Martins, pere et fils in reassembling Beatles songs shows little real innovation. The ""progressive"" development of Strawberry Fields is a work of art and the accoustic version of Guitar Weeping is disarming, but otherwise the only really new features are conjunctions and overlaps of various instrumental parts. After countless hearings of the original albums, it is nice to hear the songs in a different order, breaking up the sense of expection, but otherwise, I found this album to be a disappointment."
2,A rip-off,"The Beatles are my favorite band ever... but this CD is a rip-off.. ""The Beatles as you've never heard them before""... yeah right! They should state on the album title that it's just a remix and dissecting of songs."
4,Worth a listen,"I can't give this CD less than four stars because the songwriting and musicianship are obviously of extremely high quality. Having said that, the new arrangements, for the most part, aren't that different than they were originally. There are a few moments that are interesting, but usually the effect wears off after a few listens. Some songs, like Something, for example, probably sound better only because they are remastered and teh original albums are currently not available in that form. Two tracks in my opinion in which the new arrangements are different enough to really catch your attention are Get Back and the Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter medly (for the ending mostly)."
4,GREAT,A WHOLE NEW SOUND TO AN ALREADY GREAT COLLECTION OF SONGS. THE REMIXES ARE EXCELLENT AND 5.1 SOUND IS JUST AMAZING
5,I love the Love,"After recently seeing the Love show in Las Vegas, upon my return home I ordered the CD/DVD audio, which was much less here than at the show where they were asking about $40.00.I enjoy the remix and find the audio quality excellent.The process of ordering is what I expected from an Amazon provider and I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who is considering this purchase."
4,Dug It,"It's a fun ride since you already know all the songs, and here's this over-the-top mixing, ""enhancing"" elements you knew were there, and putting some earlier Beatles within the context of the great psychedelic classics. If anyone was qualified to undertake a project like this, it was George Martin. It's a great mix-and-match medley of Beatles songs that, in my opinion, gets better as the cd continues. It's cool to listen to him (Martin) create this sound collage, and you get the feeling he wasn't taking things too seriously as he did it - though it's a piece of work in itself - and fun to pick out pieces that you'll recognize from all over the place in these re-worked, re-mixed songs. Besides being re-psychedelicized, the sound is incredibly clear.. hmmm, heightened clarity - and the Beatles? Sounds about right!"
2,beware the hype,i was kinda of excited about this but actually listening to it is a different story.you gotta ask yourself - do you really want to hear snippets of beatles songs? do you really want these artificial mixes and transitions to get stuck in your head in place the original songs?if you need a beatles fix - i would suggest getting the anthologies (especially 2 and 3) and putting them on shuffle.
5,Sound Quality,"We all know the Beatles were the greatest. What people aren't discussing here is the sound quality of the disc. It is incredible! I bought a new Acura RDX which is one of the only vehicles that has DVD Audio true surround sound in it. The sound is amazing! Every instrument is so clear and distinct. It is all around you. Even Paul McCartney was amazed at the quality of the surround sound recording! Once you hear a good DVD Audio disc, it is hard to go back to traditional discs."
2,what a disappointment,"i bought this because of the many good reviews and also because of hearing how it is the first ""official"" remix of beatles music. but listening to it was a big let down. this is at best just a beatles best of album which tries to be as mainstream as possible. and at worst a combination of beatles and andrew lloyd webber. to call this a mashup or remix puts those styles in shame. there is absolutely no originality, at points i even have to wonder if the songs are remixed at all.what a shame that the beatles did not allow dj danger mouse's grey album ... that was real innovation."
5,FABulous,I've had this CD for several years now and still do not tire of listening to it. The way the tracks were edited and remixed are phenomenal. Sounds fantastic and has you listening to the Beatles in a new way.
5,A Beatle-Lover's dream come true!,"The Beatles in 5.1! Who'd-a thunk it? And that it was created by their original producer, George Martin, and his son, only adds to the credibility of this project. I have not seen the Cirque du Soleil production for which this recording was created, people with whom I have spoken who have seen it have glowed about the show. Hearing all of these wonderful songs with new, more vibrant mixes and some very effective reworkings, have only reinforced my belief that this was a group way ahead of their time. If this is a precursor to more music by the Fab 4 being remixed for 5.1 DVD-Audio, I will be happy to add them to my already burgeoning collection. Bring 'em on, Capitol!"
5,If I could give it 6 stars I would!,Long awaited & even better than I imagined. Remastered with sheer genius! You won't be disappointed. Can't wait to see the show in Vegas!!!
5,Epic!,This Beatles compilation is the best ive ever heard as in a compilation...how the songs are synced together as 1 song is miraculous. Buy it you won't be dissapointed! I Promise!
2,The Beatles Love,"If you really love the Beatles, you probably won't think much of this. A few good (unaltered) tunes. The rest is not so great."
3,"Good for Beatles fans, but...","...I wouldn't advocate this as a must-have addition to a collection otherwise; some of the re-mixes are pleasantly intriguing at the first listen or two, but few are what I'd call ""compelling"".Fab-Four lover? ...you'll enjoy it, but it's unlikely to supplant any of your long-time favorites."
3,The Jury Is Out!,"If you are looking for a Beatle album, because you like their music and it has always been around you, Then this album isn't it.As a long time Beatle fan, I am 50/50 on this one. I was regularly left with the feeling 'Oh God why did they do that, too that song?' Couple occasionally with 'That sounds so good, I can see why they did that!'Most people I speak too, say they don't like the album as a whole but can pick out bits & pieces that stand out as good. I can see how this would be a good soundtrack for the C.S.So in summary, If you want a greatest hits album, Try- No 1's its a winner. If you want an album that will collect dust at the back of your collection, Love is it."
3,I like the original versions better,I LOVE the Beatles.....This disapointed me. I don't like the mixes or that fact that it's NOT a REAL DVD with pictures. How much would have cost them to add some pix of the Fab 4 to the DVD?! Buy the original cd'sDennis Beatleboy
3,"Beatles ""LOVE"" = Like","I've heard that diehard Beatles fans ""dis"" this album. We'll, I love the Beatles and still have my original ticket from 1965 ""A Hard Day's Night""! The only thing about this album that I don't care for is...just as you're getting into a tune you love...BOOM...it fades to another song. There's just not enough of each tune! Martin does a wonderful job of transitioning here, unusual but smooth and a production marvel. The album just whets one's appetite and then changes the course. A little bothersome, but for what it is, a 'collage', it's great!"
1,Disappointing,"In my opinion, the Beatles Catalogue should be left alone and not suffer from such remixes. At times the voices sound out of tune and this detracts from the overall listening pleasure.With the amount of media hoopla surrounding each Beatles release it is difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff. In this case, sadly, it is chaff. Disappointing and definately for Beatles fans ONLY."
2,4 great songs - the rest unnoticable difference,"i had high hopes for this one. not unrealistic high hopes, but i am VERY DISSAPPOINTED!I really expected some stellar stuff, songs reinterrpreted and fresh.George Martin is a genious, but he bombed on this one.There are apx 20+ songs on here. They are fantastic songs, but they sound completley unchanged. I feel like I just rebought a greatest hits album I already own! The Beatles songs are gourgeous on their own, but the thing that upsets me, is this album was completely FALSELY ADVERTISED.[...]I originally bought this album after listening to the 4 tracks on the beatles myspace[...]Those songs were so gourgeously redone and are truly novel gems.Bad news, is the rest are so minimally altered, you cant even tell the difference.If you are a purist this is fine, it is like being tricked into rebuying another greatest hits album.[...]"
3,Very mixed bag.,Some of the songs aren't even remixed. At all. It has its gems though. Go listen to the whole album on Youtube before buying.
5,All You Need is...,"This is not the Beatle Anthology, but arguably better. It is not new material, but old placed in the hands of the master himself. Listening to songs with bits and pieces previously undetectable to most of us is pure pleasure. Listening to Beatle tunes remixed and edited is just what the music doctor ordered. Hey George, any possibility that you'll do some more? Please!"
5,BEATLES IN SURROUND SOUND,Finally a BEATLES CD in SUPER sound. I Imagine this is the way they heard their music in the control room with George Martin. The entire CD is a trip back thru memory lane only it sounds and feels like it was recorded yesterday.
1,Do not buy this CD - it is crap,"If you are a true Beatles fan, do not waste your money on this CD. It is nothing like the originals. George Martin may think he can remaster the originals but it comes out sounding terrible. It is a sin to try to work some of the greatest songs in the Beatles repetoire into combinations. Had I known this was what this CD was all about, I never would have bought it. This production was made for the Cirque du Soleil and thus was to produce a lot of money. I am beginning to find that their productions are getting too pat and this soundtrack goes along with it. In the beginning Cirque du Soleil was innovative, but like all big money-makers they go stale after a while. This album pulls the Beatle repetoire into the same cesspool. Since George Martin produced so much good Beatles music, it is sad to see him get into this cesspool too."
2,Full disappointment!,"It would be MUCH better to republish ALL originals AS IS, but in high-res SACD."
1,Amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together,I have been a Beatle fan since I was [...]. I even have the White Album on white vinyl. I was excited about the reviews I read so I bought this CD. I was really looking forward to listening to some wonderful Beatles music again.I was so disappointed I gave the CD away. It is a amateur job of mixing multiple sound tracks together.The songs that were chosen for this CD are already very well mixed masterpieces: i.e. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!/I Want You/Helter Skelter/Strawberry Fields.So 90% of the work was already done before George Martin's son Giles started thumbing at the controls.It would have been nice to see an array of Beatles songs that were not so commercial or heavily mixed weaved between these songs.Now that would show real mixing skill.Its a good thing that George Martin is almost deaf. I don't think he would have been too happy if he really heard what his son did.
3,I don't own this cd,"Let me say at the outset that I haven't heard this cd yet and I am not reviewing its quality or appeal. I am merely questioning why this material is not left as the artists intended. How is this process any different than movies being resized and cut to fit a tv screen. The Martins are just a couple of technicians tooling with the music. Is there any reason, then, why any one of us cannot take a creation of any artist and splice and chop until we feel we can market it to the masses and make a buck? Please understand, this cd may sound great, I just feel art should be left to those who create it, and not after the fact tinkerers."
1,This CD RUINS The Beatles classics!!!,"To remain anonymous I have chosen the ""Kid Review"" option(so Amazon please print this review). I just don't know why they would release crap like this...this is NOT true full-length Beatles' versions of their songs. I agree with some of the reviewers out there it sounds like a collage of worthless junk...it really butchers the hell out the original Beatles songs. Beatles on Broadway??? Give me a break!Bottom line: You DON'T go messing with the Beatles classics...End of story!!! FYI: Don't waste your money on this instead go buy their original classics such as ""Revolver"", ""Please,Please,Me"",""Help!"",etc."
2,The Butchered Beatles,"I admit I've never been a fan of re-mix albulms so I'm not surprised this albulm does not appeal to me. Until now I've been fairly pleased with the products that have come out during the past decade to keep making money off of the Beatles, but not this one. I borrowed it from a friend to listen to before I bought it. Thank God I did because I saved myself $12-15.I hate to criticize anything by the Beatles, but really this isn't their fault. Now I just have to hope no one gets me this for Christmas."
2,Disappointing,"I thought there would be more mixing of the actual work. A more intricate mosaic, but it was disappointing. All of those tracks of music, vocals, and fxs that can be manipulated, but it was another tribute album. An iconic group, but somebody was afraid to seriously touch those works. I don't blame them, the collection is timeless, but I was not impressed with the attempt. All of the creativity and technology available today to create something respectful and exciting, it fell short. It seems that somebody needed a job, and to assert their name in the public eye, riding on their father's coattails.A Fan of Music"
4,CD is much better if you have a good system,"DVD audio with 5 or 7 channel music...is not real music listening experience but a gimmick. This is not the right place to discuss, but as this is a popular album i am writing to enlighten most people. 2 channel creates a true image of the recording. Anything more will distort the true experience. Its like adding fake colors to cinematic movie experience. You will love it until you see the original. The biggest drawback with two channel is that you need a real good music system to create the soundstage very accurately which no multi channel can match. Probably 95% of people have never heard what i mean by soundstage. I would reccommend every one visit a high-end stereo (not best buy or frys) retail store in your area."
2,already broken,"My son loves the doll, but not as much now that it doesn't talk when you pull the string....well he'll say a 1/2 sentence. This happened relatively soon after getting the doll in the mail...bummer! Not sure if he broke it (he IS 3) or if it is a product defect. I may just cut the string so he forgets he ever talked. Woody's hat barely stays on so I stuck some velcro on it and his head. Works nice....looks a little silly...if I only had brown velcro.Maybe just a plush doll would have been a better buy."
1,Not Tom Hanks voice!!!!,"Very dissapointed, this toy does not have all the phrases from the movie and not even Tom Hanks voice. Only 5 phrases. The doll itself is well constructed but I would not recommend this toy."
3,Ring came off in less than 2 hours,"Less than 2 hours after my son began playing with this toy, the ring on the pull string came off. When the ring came off, the string fully retracted into the sound box. So, there's no longer any way to make our ""talking"" Woody actually talk. He's now just a silent doll. A well made silent doll, but silent nonetheless.Very disappointed, given the price of the doll and the fact that it's a Disney product. We expected more."
1,Poor quality,This was a gift for my 3 year old nephew. He pulled the string once and it never went back in! I would not recommend. It is not very well made.
5,My son's toy.,"My son loves his Woody!! Everywhere he goes Woody needs to be there too, also he try to go to school with Woody, love it!!"
3,"Cute, but not for younger children","We purchased this toy for my son's fourth birthday. After only 3 times of pulling the string to make Woody talk (literally), it stopped working. My husband likes to fix things, so he was able to take the components apart and fix the problem. The lid to the battery was on too snug and did not allow for the pull-string to work properly. He's had to to fix this one other time in the past 3 weeks. This toy is not for little children as the pull-string is very fragile. It is cute and just like the character in the movie. My son would have been happy to have it even if it didn't speak. Just keep in mind who you are buying it for. (And the hat that comes with the toy does not stay on...easy to lose.)"
3,Woody Needed some repair,"Woody's boots were off when he came, I had to hot glue them back on. I was not impressed with the way the back velcro panel was sewn, only half the velcro was stitched on, again I had to use the hot glue to repair. Woody was well received by my grandson because of his commercial appeal to kids."
1,Disappointed with Disney,"When I received this product, it was wrapped in a plastic bag. The pull cord was broken. The toy didn't look new. I bought this toy from Disney because I thought the quality would be of a high standard. I returned the action fiqure, and I didn't ask to replace it."
1,Woody Has Laryngitis,"Woody is cool, but he can't talk, which is the whole point of having him around. Not a rootin' tootin' good time by any means. What a disappointment. I see others have had this same problem. Disney and Amazon should get this right -- they have brands to protect and shouldn't be breaking children's hearts when they receive mute Woodys."
3,Thought my son would like this better.,This was a present for my son to match his Buzz figure. I thought he would play with it more than he does. Its a cute figure though if you have a huge Toy Story fan.
5,Toy Story Woody,Toy was just what I was looking for . My grandson loves Woody because he wants to be a cowboy.
4,Big Woody,Purchased for my grandson in Alaska. My son says that the toy is very durable and is played with daily.
1,terrible all the way around,"i know Andy's toys have a ""No Toy Left Behind"" policy, but this is one toy that should be left. five little phrases and it's not even Tom Hanks. i was disappointed but thought my son would play with it anyways. after all he's two, loves anything toy story, and plays with cardboard. i was wrong even he can see this toy stinks. still somehow despite the lack of play, woody's stitches are coming apart. total waste of money"
4,Great toy for the kids.,"In the age of alot of toys being useless, the woody doll is highly relatable by the kids today. There-fore a meaning full child likeable toy to last at Amazon."
3,not so durable,"I purchased this Woody for my 2-year old grandson and he really loved it. But I was very surprised when one of the fingers broke off during play. It wasn't as durable as I had hoped and we were unable to locate the missing finger. My grandson was sad when it broke and we had to bandage it for him to not be so upset. My son wants to replace it, but I am kind of wary about purchasing another one."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"I am disappointed with this Woody Doll! The doll is O.K. Nothing great about it. Quality is O.K. It doesn't have the original voice, TOM HANKS. Sellers should have specified that it is NOT TOM HANK's voice. Oh well, learn my lesson. Won't buy this specific doll again, if I have seen it from a store for sure.The doll's information (just in case you are interested):Toy Story & Beyond 16"" Pull String Woody Doll by Disney Store (Disney/Pixar); #44196 (B6 486775700114 11)."
4,"""There's a steak in my boat!""","My twins love this toy; we got this along with the talking Buzz Lightyear, and they've provided months of fun! There are lots of sayings that are similar to the Woody dialogue in the Toy Story film. The voice is slightly different, however, so if you are not familiar with the movie, the lines may sound different. Ex. ""There's a snake in my boot""......"
2,Pull-string broke on the first day of use :(,I think this particular doll was manufactured improperly because we also have Jessie and she has been working for the past two years. I'm hoping to get a replacement soon.
2,VALE LA PENA LA COMPRA,EL JUGUETE ES MUY PARECIDO AL GOODY DE LA PELICULA. LA CARA ES BIEN AGRADABLE. EL DEFECTO ES QUE SUELTA EL CORDEL AL SEGUNDO ESTIRON. ES BUENA COMPRA POR EL PRECIO
3,Price Gouge! This is a $24.50 disney store toy,"I thought this was lots o laughs woody. My bad for not looking at all the pics. I am returning it bc I could have bought this at the Disney Store for $20 had I realized this was the one from the Disney Store. I would have never paid $40 for it. Very disappointed, but my fault for not looking. They should be ashamed of themselves for charging twice what its worth. Not even enough decency to take the original price tag off! I want my money back.As for the actual toy, it is really cute. Any Woody fan would be stoked to get it. I'm sure my daughter would love it. If I hadn't overpaid so much for it I'd keep it. I definitely recommend it by itself, I would just not pay over the original $24.50 retail price."
4,My kids love it!,It looks just like in the movie. My kids love it so much. They also got all other main characters from the movie to play with this toy!
4,Everything you thought Sheriff Woody would be,Except for the voice which is not close to Tom Hanks its a great toy. The pull string has not been an issue either. My daughter loves Buzz more than Woody but he still get a lot of play time. I only wish the hat would stay on better. It fits very loosely and falls off easily.
1,Disappointing,"I was so excited to get a woody doll for my son for Christmas, and Amazon had the best price, however Woody's pull string didn't work the moment I pulled him out of the box. He was sent back immediately."
1,This was disasterous,"I wanted to try something that minimized my pores. I purchased this and tried it. It made my acne worse, didn't do anything to reduce the size of my pores, and had a heavy, sticky feel. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to return it for a refund. DermaDoctor needs to go back to med school! Try Dr. Brandt's Pore minimizer instead."
1,HELLLOOOO PEOPLE WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!,"Why the people doesn`t look at ingredients? i dont know if u care or not, but i wish to let you know this creams has alot of PARABENS in in, so, that make me think isnt so good as the people say...what can be so good when is just chemical inside???????"
3,not worth the $$,"I read a lot about this product before I purchased it, and I was sure I would love it. I've been using it for about a month and a half, and I have yet to see any remarkable results. I guess the pores around my nose are a little smaller, but that is a bit of a stretch. The product smells kind of funky, and tends to peel off when you apply another product on top of it (like a tinted moisturizer). I tried using less of the product and I still got the makeup peeling.Check out the dermadoctor website before making a judgement based on the reviews here. A lot of people wrote glowing reviews of the product there, and there is a lot more information on the ingredients, etc."
4,Good but could've been better,"I saw this movie on TV few months ago and decided to order it because I enjoyed watching it and because I missed the beginning of the movie. I bought it from amazon and was quite impressed by the high quality of it. Anyways to get to the point, I'm the type of military fan movies. I love action and I love the Armed Forces.This movie is all about how a military secret service (Agent Murphy) was sent in to investigate on Lt. colonel Strauss for the disappearing of some of the military soliders, and how some of the high rank officers are involved in this case. The characters in this movie are cool, I'll try to write more about this review soon, and overall it's a good movie to have."
3,"A Good Score, but not among their best.","This soundtrack is very average IMO. There are a few good songs but apparently also a few filler tracks. The best songs would be ""Going West"", ""Plane Ride"", ""Mystery Tracks"" & ""Lost in the Dunes"". Those songs makes this album worth buying if you are fanatic about Tangerine Dream.The rest of the tracks are a bit odd if I should call it that way. It's definetely not the kind of TD tracks you sit down and listen too and think ""Hey, this song is actually great"".There are too many forgettable tracks that doesn't appeal to my ears and makes me not want to listen to this album too many times when I see it in my collection. But if you are serious about collecting TD's soundtracks then I must say it's well worth picking up at any price (just for the few good songs there are) as it's getting very hard to get your hands on a copy in good condition these days.A good score, but not among their best! Try before buy!"
3,Tangerine Dream,"Bedford is one of the most beautiful communities close enough to New York City (certainly not Boston) and yet is predominantly full of horse farms and hilly properties. I actually know this ""Jeremy Boe"" and know he has seen movies, including ""Sorcerer"", which has a fantastic TD soundtrack. At one point, we thought we were the only ones who had seen it. I suggest that you watch this film and recommend that you fly to South America and get one of those cool devil trucks and fall off the cliff back into your oblivion."
3,Excellent new series!,"This was one of those books that you just wander across in the library...I'd never heard of him before. . . Atticus Kodiak is a very well-developed, well-rounded character and the plot (even if you don't agree with the politics) is attention getting. I've since read his two sequels and would highly recommend them. There needs to be some additonal development of the peripheral characters (which begins to take place in books 2 and 3) to make the whole world more exciting. Rucka's certainly an author to keep an eye out for!"
3,Very good novel marred by an unlikely ending,"Enjoyed this novel quite a bit, the field of professional bodyguards hasn't been overworked like other detective fiction. I did find the ending annoying. Not to be specific, but this highly-efficient team of bodyguards who are more or less certain an attack is about to be made, simply overlook a threat from an obvious individual. Seemed highly unlikely. I hope future books aren't quite so melancholy, and I'd like to see the rest of Atticus's team fleshed out a bit. Well worth your time."
4,Excellent,At first I did not know what to think of this book. After reading a couple of chapters I realized that the characters are very believable. The author has created very human (complete with flaws and emotional hangups) characters that seem like your actually reading about a real person. After reading this one I've gone out and read the rest of the series.
4,Just a plain old great book.,"Atticus Kodiak (aside from having one of the strangest names I ever heard, even if it is a literary name) is a great character. He's not a stiff moral guy like Spenser, but he's also not a killing machine like James Bond or Jack Reacher. He's a hard man, a genuine tough guy, but killing people bothers him, especially when it's not in self-defense, or out of anger. Keeper is a very good novel, and it presents a disturbing portrait of how strongly abortion is felt within out country. I really think it's a good book, and I recommend it."
2,Political overtones marred story line and characters,"I did not enjoy this book, the story line, or the major characters because of the political heavyhandedness of the author. The major character of the book is an abortionist, whom the author portrays as a heroine. The author is obviously a liberal, and strongly pro-abortion, and felt the need to use this genre to advance his views on the subject. Regardless of your political views, I believe that most people would find the use of this genre to be inappropriate to advance those views. The characters were political symbols and not genuine people."
1,Poor quality saffron,"I normally do not write reviews, but I decided to write one in this case to help fellow buyers. We recently bought 2 tins (1-ounce) of this item and I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the saffron. Despite its steep price, it is not pure saffron. We are seeing instant loss of color when dipped in water. The threads are breaking down almost instantly in water. Also, the taste and aroma are not very rich. I am quite disappointed with quality of the product and will never buy from this seller again."
2,Updates Pleases!,"This book is in bad need of updating. If I had known, I would not have bought it. I bought this book to use in a project in culinary school, but I had to find information in other books because the information is so out of date."
3,Not what I thought,"I thought this book would be helpful with me working on my HACCP project for class and my paper, but its not what I THOUGHT it was. I was hoping there would be HACCP attachments in the book to show me how to do a HACCP plan."
4,Snowmobile dollies,The product is very heavy duty . The only thing they might do differently is line the grooves in the ski dollies and the flat dollie with some kind of non skid rubber. Overall the product is very handy.
1,"Shoddy, better choices elsewhere","I purchased the 1500lb rated set from Northern Tools today. The first time I used the set, the dolly under the snowmobile track blew ballbearings across my drivway. There's cheap, but this is bad cheap even for a chinese product. Spend the extra $10, get a better name brand set."
2,Disappointing,Difficult to manuever. Mini games are hard to find and quickly over without allowing any play time. Rewarded with stickers for doing nothing.Sometimes pet gets stuck in one location and even resetting did not help.This item is very frustrating for young children and parents as well.
3,"sounds cute, but....","........i wouldn't reccomend this. i don't have 1 of these but in my opinion if u REALLy wants some digital pet i'd reccomend a V3 tamagotchi. i have 3 tamagotchis 2 V3 and 1 japanese V2(which isn't like USA V2 the american V2s are better!) but the LPS says ages 6 and up. now that sounds a little young for like 11,12,13 so i'd reccomend tamagotchis which are like starting at 8. even i'm 12 and i'm starting to get bored with tamagotchis but if there's a V4 coming out i'll just see what's new about it. anyway try getting a tamagotchi first....."
3,Don't let this series put you off Rinaldi,"Being a huge fan of Ann Rinaldi I can only say that this series was defnitely not her best work. If this is the first time you have read her please try something else, like A Break with Charity or Coffin Quilt both excellent books. This book on its own is contrived and sad and unless you have read the other two books I would not recommend it. Nor would I really recommend the series to anyone but a die hard Rinaldi fan."
3,A good book about friendship.,"This is not Ann Rinaldi's best work, though I enjoyed it for the story it has to tell. The author is much more enjoyable to read when she is writing about historical episodes. I have read seven of her books and rank this among the two I like least. For a good introduction of Ann Rinaldi's work, start with ""The Last Silk Dress,"" which I have read four times"
2,Thank Goodness it is Over,"Finally, this trilogy is at an end. What a sad, pitiful, disfunctional family. Even for a work of fiction this is stretching things a bit. The plot is unbelievable (even more so than Broken Days) and is basically a repeat of the previous addition to the series. If you would like to see how the trilogy ends - get the book from the library, do not waste the money and purchase it."
5,Captures the innocence ot the era-by far their best album!,"The sweet sounds of the twangy fenders reverberate through the years since the original recording. Cut after cut brings back a time when rock and roll was simple and uncomplicated. This light but determined effort is, in my humble opinion, their best all around album."
3,Good value for the price.,"As anyone that takes the time to read this review must know, Ventures fans seeking to convert their old vinyl to CD have been at the mercy of ridiculously overpriced imports and spotty availability of certain titles. Here's hoping this Pickwick re-issue of the band's second album is the first of many value priced releases as these titles pass the half century mark since their first release. No bonus tracks and non-existent liner notes, but you can't argue with the price. The band is still searching for it's signature sound on this release, and some of the tracks get a little syrupy with string arrangements that make you think you've stumbled upon a lost Mantovani album where he was experimenting with using electric guitars, but it's worth the price of admission for any fans of sixties instrumental rock."
5,Lessons for many in high-pressure working relationships,"This story of greed and glory is one that has been acted out in all types of businesses - large or small, service or product, new or old. It is a parable of overinflated egos, hyperpolitical environments and the inability of individuals to see their limits when blinded by the light of self-glorification. It is essential reading for anyone in a shared leadership role - partners, executives in tightly run corporations, etc. - and is most valuable for the lessons people should learn about themselves through Lehman's demise."
1,The Mabinogion (sample),The sample is all from the introduction. There is none of the actual text so it is impossible to judge the readability of the traslation. For that reason I didn't buy it.
1,The Mabinogian,"Simply horrible!I can't imagine this entertaining any one.That said, I suppose it has a small niche out there, some where."
4,Mabinogion,"This is a good translation of the Welsh epic, but readers may wish to compare by reading Patrick Ford's translation which I find more lively."
5,The Mabinogion,"An excellent collection of Welsh tales from the high Middle Ages. Like the contemporary Gaelic mythology it leaves one pondering the meanings of so many of the storys' details long after they finish reading it; I think the significance of so much of their content is lost on us modern readers, and probably even on the men who initially wrote them down in the 12-14th Centuries. Overall, this version of the Mabinogion is a worthwhile look into the Medieval Welsh imagination, and a good book for anyone interested in Arthurian mythology."
5,The Mabinogion,"A strange little book of Welsh fairy tales. It's not to everyone's taste, but to those who like the strange and historic, it's fun and fascinating."
4,Put down that Tolkein!,"And pick up the Mabinogion! Lots of captivating stories that lie as close to the roots of the Legends of King Arthur, etc, as we can get. Not the lightest read ever, but often compelling. The introductions to the book as a whole, and each of it's sections, are thoughtful, informative, and reasonably short."
3,Was half my book missing?,"I guess I did like this book, and hey, cute dog... gotta love that. But I felt like the author was in a horrible storm, and half her manuscript blew away, kind of randomly. But she turned the other half in, and they published it at a VERY large price for such a small book. But I just kept feeling confused throughout the book. (and he did NOT come from the east coast. Farms in Ohio don't count as the east coast). The book ended, and I was still confused, with few loose ends cleared up. I feel irritated that I was cheated out of some really good stuff. Oh well. Other reviews seemed to love this book, but I'm suspicious of their motivation. All that said, I liked the guy and the girl, and loved the dog. Makes for a decent read, but no way was it 4 or 5 stars.PS. Add extra points if you like hearing the dog's point of view. I always love that, although there could have been more of it."
1,Disappointed,"The first seven books about Corrie Belle Hollister I absolutely loved!!! I would read a whole book at one sitting.2 of the books I read in one day. But book #8 and this book I had to force myself to finish; especially this book.I have a real problem with Christopher Braxton. He has alot ofemotional baggage. Even though I believe it was a good idea to wait until Corrie and Christopher knew each for 2 years before they got married and I do not believe working for your future father-in law is the answer. He should have been out there looking for a way to support his future wife and family. But the author never really dealt with Christopher's jealousy over the fact that Corrie could command an audience when Christopher did not have that talent. I have not read the next book and I do not plan to, but I can not help but believe the real reason he wants to move east is so he will not have to compete with the Hollister's well-respected reputation in Miracle Springs."
4,Good rare magazine for X-Men fans,"The premier edition of a new posterzine line in the tradition of Future US' mega-selling, monster graphic, in-your-face phenomena Guitar Heroes and Hip-Hop Heroes. Now, the editors of PSM bring you FX Heroes! Just as X-Men III hits movie screens this summer, Future will be there with this exclusive poster-zine. This magazine sized poster book will feature all of your favorite X-Men such as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden), Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and many more."
3,falls apart in the second half....,"The first side of this album ( yes, i had the ""album"" back in the eighties ), or rather the first four songs, are simply brilliant. Too bad the same cannot be said of the last four. Pity. The last gasp of a formerly great band."
5,A MUST,"THE Ultravox's album to have if you can only chose one . One of the best new wave records from the 80's . Dancing With Tears In My Eyes , White China , When The Time Comes are absolutely brilliant examples of what electronics can do combined with unique vocals by Midge Ure . The title track - Lament , which is my personal all time favorite will make you want to listen to it again and again and again . Man Of Two Worlds and The Heart Of The Country will show you that not all electropop is impersonal and cold . To make a long story short : don't miss out , get the album and enjoy this pearl from U-Vox !!!"
3,Too far?,"When the rhetoric of your own camp makes you question where they get their information, it may mean they've gone too far. Mary Lee Smith presents, and the re-presents her case in this book. It is repetitive, slanted, but still has some important things to say. It will change the way you look at the educational political arena. It is NOT light reading."
5,Norishment,Ensure+ was prescribed by my doctor to maintain my weight and nutrient levels. I've used it (three a day) since 1998 and it has kept me in excellent health.
4,Addicting!,This show is addicting. It has been great watching the actors develop the character into their own. Surprises on almost every episode and spectacular graphics.
1,not good,the titles were much too short. Some less than a minute. I'd begin to enjoy it and it was over.
4,Amazing.,"I am a huge fan of the New BG. While watching Season One's episodes, I kept saying to myself: ""I wish I had this music."" Well, now I do. And, it is amazing!!! The composer has taken many differnt types of music from all around the world and blended them together into someting epic. He mixes Tribal, Celtic, Arabic, Electronic, Opera, and Romantic Classical music, and Muzac, into a sound that is compleatly unique, spectacular, emotional, touching, violent, and just about every other description that you can think of. The drums get a little tedious, but in all, this is definitly a ""must hear"".Of all the tracks, my favorite must be the Celtic ""Wonder My Friends"" It's both beautiful and heartbreaking. I feel moved every time I hear it."
3,Warming up,"A nice CD (""Passacaglia"" is a particular highlight), but not a patch on the soundtracks forseasons twoandthree, where many themes from this release are expanded. Of course, this is the one to get if you want to have the opening credits theme, be it the UK (and, from season 2 on, US) or original (season 1) US version."
4,Great,"Fantastic show, awesome soundtrack. The music really is a critical part of the quality of the show, and this CD accents that fact.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I'm unlikely to listen to this for the music alone. The pieces are too short to make it a cohesive emotional experience.But for a soundtrack, it's amazing."
4,"Season 3 is the best, but this is really good","I listen to this music a lot. Season 3 is the best, but the last few pieces on these disks are among the best music from the series."
3,Good for toddlers -- but not the adults....,"My two daughters (1-1/2 and 2-1/2) love this movie. They will sit still to watch the whole thing. Therefore, I can recommend it for toddler entertainment. However, the adults may want to leave the room.... It simply grates on your nerves after the first viewing -- especially the voice casting for Custard. The voice is a horrible match to the cute pink kitty pictured. And honestly, before this video, I didn't realize that a voice actor could be such a BAD actor!!! It is agony to listen to the too-hard voice deliver lines in such flat dreary tones...."
1,Frustrated and Annoyed,"It has been a month since I ordered this product and I am yet to have it delivered. I am leery to try to puchase a copy elsewhere as I may end up with two copies. I have written to them, but they have not replied. I wonder if they are out of business?"
2,Lowbrow rendition of Holst,"Skip this version. The price underscores the delivery - low price, low expectations. Mars, Bringer of War comes across like Boyscout, Bringer of Marshmallows. This wonderful work is defiled by conductor Simon. It sounds like it was recorded by the GW Bush middle-school band instead of the LSO. Sad."
1,Calypso Magic,"I have liked a number of Catherine Coulter's books for many years, but in this one she turns a good story into pornography! I was completely disgusted."
4,It was great!,"This could have been better!! It ended too quickly. It was funny and entertaining. Although I admit, I liked Midsummer Magic better. I can't wait for Moonspun Magic to come out!! I recommend this for people who have read Midsummer Magic!!"
4,I couldn't put it down ...,"I wouldn't describe myself as a big fan of Ms. Coulter's but after enjoying the first book in this series, I was looking forward to this one. It was funny and sweet. My biggest complaint is that it seemed to end too quickly. Now I can't wait to read the next book."
1,Degrading to Women,"This book degrades women. The hero of the story spanks, then fondles the heroine. Then later nearly rapes the heroine, while she is saying no. They are alone on an idea, and instead of trying to find ways to survive, the hero wants sex. This book gives the wrong message to young female readers."
1,things didnt add up,"the characters weren't consistent. The heroine starts out blunt and witty, willing to stand up for herself no matter what and by the end can't speak up to defend herself adequitely. Pretty cover, fun sparring of words, but inconsistent."
4,Baby T,The item arrived fast and was a gift for my 13 yr old niece. It was a bit small so they returned it for a different one. The return process was painless.Excellent experience
5,A must buy,Buy this now! it will fill you with happiness. This CD is wonderfully upbeat.....looking good for my album of the year...yes album so shows that I am not young. Go and buy it and you will play it until it wears out!
2,When Different Stops Being Good,"I don't understand the huge praises of this album I have heard. It starts as though someone is entering a huge gathering of people where everyone seems to be least bothered about each other.These people are completely lost and have given themselves away to the moment. The only thing quite good about Avalanches is their ability in choosing a name for their band and an even better title for their album . The music lacks shape,direction and sounds nothing but monotonous. I have known a lot of music to grow on me but Avalanches refuses to budge from it's chaotic boredom. There is way too much good music in life than to sacrifice my time on Avalanches. I wish they tried not to make the album sound like a 50 min breather of coming back to life significance (much forced)Try some real music, get these albums -The Cure - Seventeen Seconds/DisintegrationCocteau Twins - Blue Bell Knoll/Heaven Or Las Vegas"
1,Looks like a stuff up,"The CD displayed is not Yes Indeed by Ray Charles, which I would dearly love to have."
2,Pleasant 60's style R&B..but not the real Platters!,"If you like top 40 sounds that could be ""anygroup"", this is ok.....nothing to distinguish it from other groups. This is definitely not an album for people who want the smooth, emotional sound of the original Platters. Sonny Tuner does a creditable job as lead, but is definitely not a Tony Williams!!"
1,What a waste of talent,"I could not believe that with such a great cast list I could be so totally bored! There is not a single rectifying statement I can make about this film. Oliver Reed, Michael York and John Mills - acting greats, all - are totally wasted in this venture into Cartland insipidity. The dialogue and ""action"" are filled with cliches, and there could not be a flatter relationship than that between Grant and Anthony - not one spark! Don't waste your time and money."
5,Wonderful Seller,The seller was great. Everything was exactly as stated and then some. Would absolutely recommend using them.
3,good Barbara Cartland adaptation,"Filmed for British cable in the early 90's, this was one in a series of four movies based on the romantic period novels of Dame Barbara Cartland. Set during the reign of King Charles II, THE LADY AND THE HIGHWAYMAN is the tale of a love affair between notorious criminal Silver Blade (Hugh Grant) and Lady Panthea Vyne (Lysette Anthony). When the king's jealous mistress Barbara Castlemaine (Emma Samms) discovers the romance, she decides to send them both to the gallows. Swashbuckling adventure and breathless romance abound in this enjoyable tale. The cast also includes Oliver Reed, Gordon Jackson, Sir John Mills, Claire Bloom, Christopher Cazenove and Michael York."
1,If only I could give this movie an even lower rating...,"The picture quality is HORRIBLE (and the sound is just as bad) Blurry, shaky, and the speed is off as well.The movie itself wasn't much better and Hugh Grant is barely recognizable. Save your money and let this one go by."
1,The Lady and the Highwayman,Story line was fair but the color was terrible and fuzzy. Wasn't worth watching or the price no matter how low the cost was.
3,a remake of robin hood but still a great love story,i think that if your looking for a love story to watch on a lonely night or just to make you feel like your in love then this is a good movie. but if you are looking for a movie that requires thought or any brain power then this is not a movie for you.
2,The quality of this DVD,"I'm fond of movies set in older times and usually there is no problem with viewing them. This DVD however is a very bad one. I'm not reviewing the movie's plot, simply the condition of the DVD itself. The entire movie was quite blurry and in some of the scenes set in a cave, I was unable to see well enough to follow the action. Near the end of the movie strange tracking lines began running up the DVD and I've never seen that on any DVD before, only VHS tapes. Now I'm wondering if this was simply copied from someone's old badly taken care of VHS tape. I'm very disappointed because I had looked forward to seeing this movie. I really cannot recommend these DVDs to anyone."
3,"swords, kings, busting boosoms, and Hugh Grant","I first saw this movie years ago on tv as a teen. I remember my friend thinking Hugh Grant was soooo cute, I remember thinking, is she serious ... ""does she need glasses?""Well Hugh Grant became so popular, but this movie was made prior to this. I love Hugh Grants movies.I don't think it is meant to be taken seriously. So if you enter, don't expect a literary classic turned movie of the week.This movie makes me laugh and laugh, it is so cheesy and so 80's. So much of the time Grant looks bewildered and confused(possibly drugged?), or barely with a pulse of excitement. The women are dramatic with their bossoms busting out of their corsettes as they tilt over and fan rapidly. I'm telling you, that fan was whipping wildly! LOL...This movie and whether it appeals to you is dependant greatly on your mood. But although I give only 3 stars due to lack of visual clarity, I wouldn't recommend it if it didn't genuinely make me snicker."
2,I have to believe ...,"I have to believe that this is one of Hugh Grant's first movies. The acting is reminiscent of a high school production. Don't get me wrong, I think Hugh is a terrific actor, just not in this. The story line is so-so to marginally OK. Wish I could like it more."
1,Bad,This movie is so bad that it's hilarious. Seriously. I thought at first it might be a spoof it was so silly. It's kinda hard to believe Hugh Grant still managed to have a great career after this!
2,I Kept Falling Asleep,"I am a Grant fan but I prefer his movies that were made latter in his career. This movie was made in the 80's based upon how young Grant looked. Next time I will do a better job in determining when the film was made prior to purchase. Otherwise I would not have rented the film. Therefore, my review of this film is not positive--as expected.Disappointing at best. I kept falling asleep, so maybe I missed some thrilling and defining moments. Regardless, character development was predictable, boring and silly.I do not recommend. Cheers!"
5,High quality,"I have had this sander now for 10 years,and have put many hours of use on it. Absolutely no problems with reliability. I have just recently added the graphite platen, which is noticeable improvement in keeping the belts cooler. The purple belts are the best I've tried. Sanding the osb sub-floors inside the house, I removed the dust bag and taped my shop-vac hose to it. This combination eliminated all visible dust in the air or floor, for real dustless sanding. This is a very good no-nonsense sander and I highly recommend it for serious sanding, but if you don't want to risk uneven gouging on mor delicate work, an orbit sander is better suited to the task."
2,Pro's and con's of the Deluxe Edition Scrabble Game,"I'm disappointed and delighted about my new Scrabble Deluxe game.The two things I am very disapointed at is the cheap plastic hinges that fold the game up breaks off after about the third time we opened it.Very cheesy and cheap.Also, the turntable for the game is not what we expected. We thought for $44. we should have at least had a turntable like a lazy Susan, but it rolls on casters which will mar a wooden table. I want my money back or a replacement, so now I will have to pursue that avenue. So, if cheap hinges, and no good turning board are your thing have at it.I am delighted with the size of the board and more letters and score points. Takes three hours of good old fashioned fun to finish."
3,Super Scrabble is Super Long,"After playing regular Scrabble for years, I was interested in trying the Super Scrabble, as I thought the extra tiles and spaces would produce an ""extra fun"" game. It doesn't! Unless you have a lot of spare time, you will need to play this game in more than one session. For me personally, this takes the fun out of the game. Also, the board was poorly made, as the middle seam (where the board folds in half) was not flush and any tiles placed on this seam, did not sit properly. I intend to return to my old regular Scrabble."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my grandson because we love to play Scrabble and he wanted the rotating board with raised tile boxes. When we opened this we were surprised to see that it does NOT have a rotating base, it has some metal beads on the bottom that allow it to turn...if it is on a very smooth surface and even then it doesnt turn well. The board folds in the middle so the tiles down the middle don't sit well and the plastic board surface is not glued down properly. Also, Super Scrabble is a different game with double the amount of tiles to play and a much bigger board so that a game of Scrabble will take much, much longer to play.For $40 I expected better quality. We only kept it because I bought it online and didn't want to jump through the hoops of returning it via mail with shipping costs."
2,Great game but board poorly constructed,The plastic grid arrived in warped condition making tile placement difficult in the affected areas of the grid. While it still is playable the warped grid is distracting and disappointing.
5,Great spin on the traditional Scrabble game!,"Lots of fun to rack up quadruple letter and word scores! It's also easier to get double-double scores, etc. I would recommend subtly marking 100 of the tiles to make it easier to play a traditional game if you desire, as the full 200 tile game can take quite a while. The ball-bearings on the base of the board make it incredibly easy to slide, rotate, and move the board. More fun with 4+ players."
4,Super Scrabble,"The game is more challenging than original version, takes longer to play but loads of fun! We love it!Betsy"
2,no information given about this product by amazon,"This is not the scrabble game I was expecting.I bought it because of the raised grids, which it has. However it also has twice the number of spaces and letters. The board is much larger than the standard game.No such information was given by Amazon. I had to pay for return shipping which I did not appreciate. Be sure you understand what super deluxe means before you purchase this game."
3,should have done better but......,"The turntable was the major disappointment. The quality just wasn't great. I've always liked scrabble and the extra playing space is great, it also adds time. If you really like scrabble you'll like this extended version."
2,"Design, Craftmanship, & Challenge of Game","The design and craftmanship of this board is very poor. They use inexpensive plastic hinges on each end which causes ""warping"" of the thin plastic used. If they would 'spring' for two additional plastic hinges between each end it would greatly help in reducing the warping of the board. As it is I am expecting my third shipment in hopes of finally receiving ""one"" board that isn't warped and I can lay my letters flat. Upon picking up the board one has to be extremely careful as it tends to break apart at the hinges.Overall as a game it's terrific having more spaces and tiles to play with as it makes for a much more interesting and challenging game."
2,Fragile Scrabble Game,"This is a very cool Scrabble game. However, it arrived damaged, one of the little plastic hinges was broken upon arrival. It was a Fathers Day gift. We played it that evening and the tiles wouldn't sit flush because of the broken hinge. I have emailed the company twice with no response."
2,super scrabble deluxe edition,"I was very disappointed in the workmanship of this game. It was poorly made and it did not look like it would withstand years of playing. I owned this game in the past, but it was made by Milton Bradley. This particular game was made by the Hasbro Co. I think Milton Bradley game was of excellent quality. In the future, I will only buy games made by Milton Bradley."
5,Good purchase,"It takes a long time to complete a game, but it is fun to make big words and high scores. Only complaint is the the center of the board doesn't lie flat."
2,Very disappointed,"For the amount of money paid for this game, we were very disappointed in how cheaply it was made. It is basically two pieces of plastic with cardboard sandwiched between them. The plastic is warped so much that the tile letters do not lay flat. The board folds in the middle and the two pieces do not even meet correctly, with one side raised higher than the other. As a result, all tiles placed on squares that run down the middle of the board, do not lay flat. There are several warped areas that lift up throughout the board that will pop if you press down on it, making the tiles pop up in the air.The concept is great. The product is not."
5,Way more fun than the original,"Original Scrabble was great, but it always felt like you were trying to cram words on the board for the last half of the game. Super Scrabble makes larger words easier throughout the game, ups the game length and points, and takes some of the focus off the puzzle aspect and places it back on the word competition, where it belongs.The Deluxe version is definitely worth it... the raised grid keep the letters nice and neat, and rarely bumped out of place. The ball bearings on the bottom help the folding board turn smoothly, but I wonder how long before they get stuck. This game is a ton of fun, a great improvement on the original, and worth the money for the deluxe designation."
3,somehwat flimsy,"Two complaints about this item. 1-The board, especially the hinges are extremely flimsy. I don't expect it to hold up. and 2-Believe it or not, there are too many ""bonus"" squares...makes it almost too easy to score big and takes some of the fun out of it."
1,Very poor quality,"Love the idea of this game, but the quality is extremely poor. Had I seen this in the store, I never would have paid this much money for it."
4,Scrabble game.,Ordered as new. Received as used. Should be better informed.. Price was different. Otherwise we are very happy with the game. Jack OB
2,High price for poor quality,"I have the Milton Bradley 50th Anniversary version of Scrabble and I like the quality of the game board and accessories. Thinking that this Hasbro version would be a new and interesting addition to the Scrabble line, I bought it as a gift for my friend. Unfortunately, when my friend opened it, I was embarrassed when I saw how cheap it looked. I paid way too much for a product of cheap quality. I'll stick with the Milton Bradley line in the future."
2,Super scrabble board not made well,I do like the expanded version. I am not happy with how poorly the board is constructed. I received it in a broken state. Plastic hinges are not strong enough to hold the boards weight. I had to glue and tape it together so it will not fall apart anymore. Pretty pricey for poor weak plastic design.
4,Super Scrabble Deluxe,"Scrabble is a great game and the super scrabble deluxe edition is no exception. Raised grid - must have. Larger board, more tiles - must have. The turntable is a sorry excuse compared to the real turntables. This game has several ball bearing type rollers that allows for turning the table. It works but compared to the real turntable model, pretty sorry. I can get by with that but the really sorry part is that the table folds in half via 2 small plastic hinges and the two halves of the board don't line up which makes for an uneven surface for those tiles to lay. The bottom line is that I'll use it and the real problem is quality control in CHINA!"
4,Scrabble,Product arrived as promised. Waiting for a crowd to play the game. Expect excellent results. Sorry I can't be more specific.
2,Poor quality board.,"I gave this to my mother as a gift. After she took it on a trip to my sister's, they recommended I return it. The board folds in half, unlike the Deluxe Edition of the regular Scrabble game. The board is flimsy and didn't lay flat along the fold line, so the letters wouldn't lie flat. I was disappointed, to say the least. We love playing Scrabble, so my gripe is only about the board quality."
4,Super Scrabble,I played this game while visiting my Aunt and Uncle in FL and we had so much fun that I had to buy it when I got back to NY. The only problem I had was that the fold on the board doesn't allow the letters there to lay flat.
4,"Great concept, mechanically weak","Really enjoyed having twice the letters and space. The black letters on the natural wood tiles are easier for me to read than the gold on maroon tiles. The additional bonus squares boost the high score possibilities. The hinges on the board are weak. The roller bearings allow the board to swivel on smooth surfaces and catch on uneven surfaces. I also miss the having the letter count on the tile holder. With careful use, Super Scrabble Deluxe Edition is a great educational game. Math, spelling, logic and memory skills are constantly used. I recommend the Scrabble dictionary and the Webster's dictionary to develop skills and knowledge."
1,Not happy with,"For the price of this item roller balls are worthless, should have been on lazy susan style. Very shabbily made and must be very careful when opening and closing game. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,scrabble board complaint,The concept is great but the design is terrible. Two of our hinged boards have broken at the hinge with very gentle use. The larger board should be redesigned like the Milton Bradley Deluxe Edition with grid and turntable - a much better design.
1,Not what I was looking for,Was not what I expected. I was wanting the regular Scrabble gamewithout all the extras. Order a different one later
2,Poor quality,Poorly and cheaply made. Board comes apart at hinges with little effort. Not at all what we expected! Miss our old board terribly!
4,Super Scrabble is SUPER,"Our family played a lot of Scrabble on vacation this summer, but found that our games were too short and frustrating on the standard (100 tile) board. This one is MUCH better and allows for longer games/higher scores. I do, however, have a few complaints: 1) The board is set on ball bearings. I don't find it too be much easier to rotate this board than the standard board...and it takes more space, so it's actually more difficult. 2) I love the fact that the tiles stay in place on the board, but they are actually difficult to put away once the game is over. If the board is folded in half with the tiles on it, the board comes apart (it doesn't break....it can be put back together, but it's a pain). So, we actually end up picking off the tiles individually, which takes a lot of time. I bought the Official Scrabble Dictionary when I bought this game and it stores in the box perfectly. That is our rule, if the word isn't in the OSD, it cannot be used."
3,"Scrabble is great, hinges and rollers could use upgrade.","As always, Scrabble is great but,the hinges and rollers could use some upgrades. The first time out of the box, the game board came unhinged and it took a good bit of time finessing it back together without breaking the plastic. Then the rollers are so small they only work well on a perfectly smooth surface. Otherwise it was great fun and the other features worked well."
4,Scrabble Deluxe Review,Great game for (4) people...like the inset board for tiles. Would recommend for anyone that likes Scrabble to purchase.
3,Super Scrabble,"We just purchased this game a few months ago. Although it meets the criteria to play Scrabble, I thought it was cheaply made. For the price, I expected heavier wood tiles and tile holders. Also the board was plastic and does not turn easily. We use it, but were disappointed with the quality."
5,Good quality Scrabble edition,"I purchased this item as a gift for an aunt who loves playing Scrabble. However, due to a significant essential tremor, she can't play a regular Scrabble game. The pieces end up scattered everywhere.She LOVES this version. The grid lines are just enough so that she can place the tiles without knocking others out of the way. The board rotates on little casters, and it works well.Pricey, but if you have someone who really could benefit from the raised grid, it is worth it!"
5,"Edward E. Ford, Phoenix, AZ","Well cast and written. Easy to follow, lots of twists and turns. Very surprise ending,totally unexpected. John Nettles plays his part well, with natural human reactions and yet he isn't one of the many super-detectives. In short, he relates well to the viewer. The viewer can follow his line of thought. His relationship with his partner is honest, respectful, and seems true to life. Everyone was well cast, and I especially enjoy watching many of the older actors."
3,Entertaining and Creepy,"The scenery and architecture of this village was so pretty and serene, yet the crime was so appalling gory. The plot seemed a bit incredible. I'm unsure how I feel about this show; I've never seen Midsomer Murders before this. Apparently this program is always highly rated and thought highly of, but based on this episode, I'm not sure I'm interested."
4,The Ventures are the kings of instrumental rock!,"This was the second Ventures CD I ever bought. The 2-LPs-on-1-CD format grabbed me. Plus I wanted to have ""Slaughter on 10th Avenue"" and ""I Feel Fine"" [a Beatles cover]. So I ordered this CD, and liked it immediately after I put it on. First of all, the sound quality is excellent stereo with great separation. Next, the performances are simply awesome.The Ventures are so much fun to listen to; it makes you want to go out there and play those songs yourself! Just about every song is extremely listenable. The covers of hits of the day are fun (I Feel Fine, Gone Gone Gone, Hang On Sloopy, Oh Pretty Woman, etc.).The first 2 of the three bonus tracks are in mono. ""The Savage"" was a B-side. The second, I don't know about. The third shouldn't even be on the CD - it's some disco thing from the 70s. But otherwise, it's a great CD to play at parties of whatever. Buy it now. Excuse me for being a salesman."
1,Smells like The Green Tree,"It smells like the green tree, over-powering, no jasmine scent. I had it in my car for 15 minutes and threw it away. It took a week for the smell to go away. Yuck"

3,Introduction,Good introduction but I wouldn't use the tecniques until you read Go up and work with God. This is where it all is.
5,Best book for starting your journey of talking to God,"Fabulous information to get you on track to your own evolution and healing. Even though this book was published some time ago the information in it is invaluable to your growth path, the tools and techniques in it are timeless.This book got me started on a simple easy path to my own personal evolution. I hope you enjoy it.Helen MeaderAuthorWeight Consciousness: Changing The Beliefs That Prevent Permanent Weight Loss"
1,"15 years later, still no proof","This book was written because the author claims that she instantly healed herself of cancer. (yes, I'm serious) 15 years after the magical moment, it has been discovered that she never had cancer, which makes it impossible to heal. This, and her other books, have mislead people into believe that the ""product"" works- which is her technique that she claims she channeled from God. There is no proof that this whole ""DNA Activation"" thing works AT ALL, but it's claimed to make people younger. So, why is the author aging? And why are people still dying of cancer (and other ailments).This books is worthless. No, wait. You can use a page of it if you have a wad of gum to throw away and lost the wrapper."
4,Commanding manifestation,"The information in this book, both of Stibal's books really, is fantastic. Western culture has generally lost its identity as creators and co-creators, as well as the humility and grace to see themselves as part of the active process of prayer. Stibal gives an astouding way to not only bring healing into one's being, but to reconnect with the Divine. This book is, however, not for the precriptivist grammarian. It is very poorly written, thus, very poorly edited. Stick with it anyway. The information is genuine and provoking, but you're going to wince a lot in the process."
3,Hard To Understand,"If you're new to energy healing and psychic work, this may be a little hard to understand. You're instructed to go up 67 feet and command the universe etc.But this type of healing works and I'm glad this book is out there. GetThetaHealingwhich contains this info and more, plus it's better edited."
5,Excellent Book,"I really loved this book. I think Vianna sounds incrediable, one day I would love to meet her. This book has really lifted my sprits. I would suggest reading it if you want a good book."
5,Can't beat the quality of BBC's Natural History Unit's photography!,"When it comes to nature films, NOBODY does it better than BBC's Natural History Unit! The photography is superlative high definition, the content very interresting and informative, plus, I personally prefer the original BBC versions with British narrators than Discovery Channel's re-issued ""Americanized"" versions which replace the original voice with voice-overs using American actors instead! Why would they do that? England IS where the English language comes from, don't cha know?"
1,Exceedingly poor quality,"Seriously shoddy quality, back board is really flimsy and doesn't even attach to the the piece you sit on. Parts not manufactured well, pieces arrived scratched, some parts don't even fit."
1,Winsome = poor quality,"Poor quality, poor fit, poor design, cheap hardware, don't buy. Screws stripped, took me 8 deck screw to tighten up joints!!"
4,"Partly raveup, partly cheese, & we love em...","I wonder how many garage band guitarists learned these songs by listening to these two albums? Well, thanks be to the Japanese for conferring god-like status upon the Ventures; otherwise these albums may never have found their way back into print in America. Like all Ventures albums, these two are partly cheese & partly raveup, featuring great songs, not-so-great songs & the interchangeble Ventures originals we enjoy so much (they often recycled them with new titles). Clean, professional, good background music for writers & artists. Of course, the real game is still in collecting the Ventures on vinyl. Highly recommended: Ventures in Space, also available on CD.Bob Rixon, WFMU"
4,Works just like indicated.,Recieved product very quickly. Same item sold on other websites for more money. It works just as the description says.
3,not a toy,"it is a great magnet, and it easy to pull from the wall as it has a nice handle, but do have a problem when they are drop on the floor, because of there size."
3,The cover is cool but...,"The movie itself isn't as exciting as I had hoped. About the escapades of a deaf hitman, it has its moments as he falls in love and out of touch with his life. The are a few easy to hate antagonists as well as the love stricken lead killer. Overall, it didn't hold my attention as I wanted it to. A decent effort but more for big Asian film fans."
4,mophia based film,"I used to live in asia and I have seen some things over seas. It was a good perspective of mophia related activities and generally was able to tell basic happenings among the common people's side of it. A hit man who is deaf, has to even the score of his friends who wind up in situations that are less than happy places to be. It is a street perspective but nothing glamourous and expensive for shooting, not bad at all either though, just basic camera plus a little more, some nice perspectives at times. Decent and entertaining even towards old school and graphic, I liked it and felt like it needs a review."
3,Style over substance,"This film plays like your standard HK action film, but it's from Thailand. There isn't much dialogue since the main character is a deaf mute. The plot is barely there, you just know that Kong, the main character is an assassin for the Thai underworld, and that he was mentored by a guy named Joe in the art of gun handling. The plot is also cliche(bad guy seeks redemption, you know the story).Now on it's technical merits, Bangkok Dangerous is hyperstylish. The directors seem to toss ever camera trick and editing technique in the book right at you(bullet time, slow motion, color filtering, montage, quick cuts, blur effects. . . I'm sure I missed a few.)Anyway, if you're looking for a plot and interesting characters, skip this one, but if you appreciate a film soaked in style, give it a shot."
3,an OK movie,"i guess people did not like the Thailand cinema try and outdo HK cinema....this movie was not as good as ' a better tomorrow' ' the killer'. i thought it was prety original and creativethe deaf hitman was too much, i think. his friend, had almost no purpose. his gf, whom happens to own a strip joint, got raped and gets killed at the end. now the grl that deaf hitman loves...i duno what's about her but i liked her acting.the deaf hitman was good. he expressed his feelings without speaking so i give him props for that.some creative ideas in this moviewatch it wit lil or no expectaion, then u will like it"
1,Pure GMO (genetically modified organism) Vanilla Powder,"I bought this vanilla powder in Whole Foods, I assumed that Whole Foods sell best products. Unfortunately WH also sell GMO, but they pay me money back even for empty bottles of this vanilla powder.I do not recommend to buy this vanilla powder, especially for children and young adults, because maltodextrin is made from GMO (genetically modified organism).Nielsen-Massey company also give me false info over the phone that they do not use GMO.Here is part of document I received from Nielsen-Massey company by email:""To whom it might concern:Regarding MALTRIN M100 and M510 maltodextrin, these products are processed from some GMO raw materials. These products will typically test negative for GMOs by PCR method. Those products will not meet EU labeling regulations as a non-GMO...."""
2,"""Pure"" vanilla powder??","I was disappointed that this product was not as advertised. It may be pure vanilla powder but it is mixed with a lot of sugar (dextrose). The advertising on the side says it is 'sugar-free' but the ingredients list dextrose or something similar. The ingredient list was covered by a sticky label so it was hard to see what the actual ingredients were.They need to change their product or their advertising. They don't match. Otherwise, I like the taste and the fragrance of this product. Just don't want to pay a high price for something that is part sugar."
3,Not my favorite L'Amour,"I want to preface this review by saying that Louis L'Amour is my favorite western writer.Although a great story and in keeping with typical L'Amour characteristics, I was frequently lost as to who was speaking or from what perspective at any given moment. I found myself thinking several times that the writing was that of an amateur rather than that of a master like L'Amour. It was also crazy-short. I read it in one easy afternoon, and then had nothing to do in the evening. Really, my low rating is because of my disappointment in the length of the story, and also the awkwardness of the perspective. Also, I thought the plot was a little underdeveloped for a L'Amour. Basically, skip this one and read a Sackett."
3,The Burning Hills,"Having read about everything Louis L'Amour wrote this is not one of my favorites.Not bad ,just not on a par with most of his other works."
5,the burning Hills,I think this is an excellent classic Louis L'Amour novel. Action packed and suspenseful from beginning to end. As usual you can almost see and know each of the characters. His attention to detail is excellent I think this is 1 of his best novels. And I've read almost all of them.
4,Great total body work-out!,"Patrick Goudeau is an excellent and motivating trainer with lots of positive energy. I like to use this dvd for days when I want a moderate, not strenuous, work-out. Worth the purchase!"
5,Only Ever you - Backspaced,"Great dance music, full of energy, great lyrics.Sounds like midnight oil, only better.Buy this album, support NZ music.This is good stuff."
4,PRETTY GOOD....,"I love this CD, although Mya is only great on CD tracks, Ive seen her on television, she has to strenghten the lungs a bit. Anyway, I don't know about everyone else's CD, but track number 3 on mine in FREE. FREE is the best song, this is definitely one to play in the summer, old tune or not. Lie Detector is great as well. All in all, good sophmore effort for MYA."
5,Mya is flyin'!!,"this is one of the best cds i've bought!! All the songs sound different in a good way. The best songs were how you gonna tell me, best of me, case of the ex, and now or never. Other good songs were takin' me over, lie detector, and that's why i wanna fight. KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT SONGS MYA!!!!!"
5,Mya's new cd is the bomb!,"I like every song on Mya's new album! My favorites are Case Of The Ex, The Best Of Me, Lie Detector, Can't Believe and Fear of Flying. She keeps improving with every album!"
4,The next big singer/entertaner,"I'm a musician, so i'm not real keen on looks alone, but Mya is the ultimate full package, looks, vocals, music, and a dancing machine. The next Janet Jackson. Don't get this cd and you'll regret it.. Bangin baby, just bangin.."
5,lady t,"THIS IS A GREAT CD I LISTEN TO IT ALL OF THE TIME.I THINK THAT EVERY ONE SHOULD BY IT. SINCERLEY, LADY T"
4,Sophmore Slump? I think not!,"I stole this Cd from my cousin because I loved Case of the Ex and Best of Me. When I listened Mya took my interest with her up tempo numbers and dreamy ballads. While her voice isn't top notch it doesn't matter. Only Pussycats to me is a miss step.Mya actually channels a little soul on Man in my life (Toni Braxton like someone else said). However a highlight is I can't believe a slow tune about how Mya can't beleive her man is in love with another and not her. A lot of people can relate to that! Should have been a single.Favorites: Best of me, Case of the ex, Man in my life, and I can't believe."
3,"MYA's Latest ""Fear of Flying"" is better than her first one..","I guess I shall be the first to review this title. Since I've listened to it and all. Mya has certainly come along way since her first LP. In this album she has a more bolder sound. The first track (Case of the ex) reminds me of a hard edge ""Destiny's Child"" song. Also I thought their are some corny semi childish songs such as the song ""Pussy cats,"" in which you are delighted to hear sounds of real cat meows. She also trying some reggae with the wyclef jean produced track ""Lie detector."" The most personal & Sincere sounding song would be ""Fear of flying."" Which happens to be one of the better songs on the album. But in all its refreshing to see a real talented young artist out, instead of the bubble gum fluff thats been blasting the air waves."
2,Disappointed,"I'm sorry, but I am not feeling this album at all. I never used to like Mya until she came out with ""Best of Me."" That is probably the only good song on there. That and along with ""Lie Detector."" The first couple of songs have really hot beats and the lyrics send out a good message. It's just her voice that makes you wanna not listen. For some reason her voice and the beats don't go well. I gave her 2 stars for the fact that there are only 2 GOOD songs on the whole CD. Sorry!"
5,Mya's returned!,"Fear of Flying is exactly what her fans have been waiting for. On Fear, Mya shows significant growth -co-writing and producing more than ever. She's also managed to take a few more ""confidence"" steps with her voice. It's much bolder and the songs are much easier to get into. The version that actually hit the streets is a little different than the above listing -no Girls Like That -or Jordan Knight duet. Not certain why that is . . .Hmmmm. Regardless, Fear is much better than her debut in every way. Stronger production, better instrumentation, and like I said, Mya seems to be much more comfortable in front of the mic. Highlights include Case of The Ex and How You Gonna Tell Me. If you're reading this & haven't ordered yet -DO SO NOW!"
3,"Great, but not fabulous","I had a lot of expectations for this CD and I wasn't totally disappointed. Their are 18 tracks on this CD and the first 12 are great, but then the last 6 seem to be ""just there"" filling up space. Ho-hum pop=music type sugary love songs without any real substance. Overall, it's a good CD, but don't expect it to be ""good the last drop""."
3,You say this album is good!,"Alright, Mya IS tight...her first album was tight as hell..this one? Well let's just say I was a little disappointed. I bought it thinking everything would come down just like ""Best of Me"", but I was wrong. The first half of the album is good, but once you hit on ""Lie Detector"", it goes downhill. It takes on a VERY immature approach and cheesiness. And the song with Left Eye, come on now. I thought the TLC Diva could do a little better. Those were really the two songs I didn't like straight off...the rest is alright though. Liked the first album better, though."
2,disappointing,"when I heard ""case of the ex"" I expected this cd to be so much better than it really is.I luv ""case of the ex"",""ride and shake"","" the best of me"" and ""takin me over"" but the rest is kinda poor.the ballads for instance:I really adore beautiful ballads but those r a bit too schmaltzy.I just read you could compare her to Destiny's Child,Alicia Keys or Aaliyah (God bless ya,babygirl!) but you can't!they're much better than her.not only that Mya's lyrics couldn't touch me inside what good lyrics used to but her vocals either aren't that good..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CDs OF THE YEAR,"I bought the FEAR OF FLYING cd a few weeks ago,and I'm very happy I did. The cd takes about a week to get used to. 1.Turn It Up- a great way to start a CD 4/5 2.Case of the Ex- her 2nd single, and no questions why 5/5 3.Ride and Shake- good song, good chorus 4.3/5 4.That's why i wanna fight- not a GREAT song, 3.5/5 5.Pussycats- first 20 seconds wonderful, the rest is ok 3.5/5 6.The Best of me- one of my personal favorites, 1st single 5/5 7.Lie Detector-takes getting used to, one of my favorites 5/5 8.How you gonna tell me-here's another winner 4.8/5 9.Grandma Skit- not much you can say about it...... 10.Takin Me Over- prob 3rd favorite, wonderful 5/5 I would by the CD just for those songs, adn there are 8 more good tracks. i am very happy I bought the CD, you will be too."
2,Could've Been Better,"For my b-day in 2000, I got this CD as one of my presents primarily b/c I like the song BEST OF ME. Well, that song and a few others are the only good songs on the CD which seems like a rush job and something that Mya was not really focused on. SOPHOMORE SLUMP does apply to this CD which fortunately did go platinum.Some of the best songs are the hip-hop RIDE AND SHAKE, BEST OF ME, CASE OF THE EX,TEARS ON MY PILLOW, THE FIRST TIME. Many of the faster songs are kinda lame and the CD takes a long time to get used to in which by that time u have moved on, but it is a nice effort."
5,"The Good, The Mild, & The Excellent","Mya's sophomore debut can make you totally forget that her last hit was the softly-sung ""My First Night With You."" In songs such as ""Case of the Ex,"" ""How You Gonna Tell Me,"" ""Lie Detector,"" and ""The Best Of Me,"" Mya shows us that she's matured into a beautiful young woman with a smooth, talented voice. With an appearance from TLC's Lisa ""Left-Eye"" Lopes, Mya's vocal talents truly shine on this album. Among my personal favorites are ""Now Or Never,"" ""Pussycats,"" ""Takin' Me Over,"" and ""That's Why I Wanna Fight."" This CD is a must-buy for any R&B fan in the music world."
5,Great Beats,"This CD is wonderful. It's got some beats that are so cute. Some of the tracks will make great summer songs. These tracks show more of her true self than her first album. Some songs that'll get you hooked on this CD are Best of Me f/ Jadakiss, Pussycats, Lie Detector, How You Gonna Tell Me, Takin' Me Over, and Now or Never. The words to her songs have a lot of meaning to them. Just listen to what she's saying. You won't regret it. Buy this CD. Keep up the good work, Mya!"
3,it was alright,"It had some good tracks such as ""Takin me over"", ""Best of Me"" but I wouldn't advise you to rush out and buy it. It's not a c.d. that, on the whole, sticks out to me as being something very different or very good.~"
4,Great Album,"This album is really good. It has great party songs like ""Case Of The Ex"", ""The Best Of Me"" and ""Ride & Shake"". It also has beautiful ballads ""Can't Believe""(my fave song on the album), ""Tears On My Pillow"" and the title track ""Fear Of Flying""."
1,Another Formulaic Singer!,"I don't understand how Mya got a record deal. Her voice is very thin and annoying. I guess because she is lightskinned and cute that is the preresquite of making it in the R&b world. I gave her a star because I do like one song which is the midtempo ""Best of me"" I dont like her vocals but the beats are pretty good. This album will be a bestseller on the r&b charts because she has the above preresquites to make it But the trouble is she sounds like every other below 21 singer today. Her limited range and formula music won't allow for her to become a superstar but she will atleast be eye candy on B.E.T"
3,3.5 stars - average,"Fear of Flying begins with strong up-tempo tracks, but as the album winds (and slows) down, results are mixed."
4,THIS CD IS WHOA!,"MYA U LOOKIN GOOD BOTH IN LOOKS AND VOCALS SHE SANG HER HEART OUT IN THIS CD.BUT SOME SONGS SCREWED IT UP LIKE NO TEARS ON MY PILLOW,MAN OF MY LIFE,AND FOR THE FIRST TIME.BUT SHE STILL GOT IT GOIN ON"
2,"""I Can't Let You Get The Best Of Me""","On this album's first single, ""The Best Of Me"", Mya sings ""I can't let you get the best of me"". And she's right. This is hardly the best this girl could do. Her voice is sweet and soft, which balances well with other vocalists and rappers, so the best songs her are the colloborations. Jadakiss, Beenie Man, and the late Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes let Mya shine while they do their thing. The only solo track here that really works is her smash hit ""Case Of The Ex"". The rest of the tracks are far from praise worthy. The ballads are banal and dull. ""Pussycats"" is a vile bit of throwaway R&B. To make it worse, she re-issued this album later with her catchy single ""Free"", and I'm left with this dud. Some solid tracks, but on the whole, it's not that good R&B by numbers. I hope Mya can pull off a hot third album soon. Good luck to her."
5,A great Mya album,"Tracks that are very memorable are obviously: Case of the Ex and Best of Me (with JadaKiss). But other tracks that are great favorites of mine are Lie Detector, That's Why I Wanna Fight, Pussycats.Mya has incredibly powerful vocals (memorable from a song NOT on this album where she did chorus: Ghetto Superstar) and yet her intense range is not showcased or even hinted at in most, if not, all of this songs. Still, that doesn't take away from the catchy and carribean beat that we all love to hear and groove to."
5,One of Mya's Best CVDs,I definitely think that this is one of Mya's best CDs if not the best. I can play this CD all the way through without skipping any songs. Too bad I cannot say the same for a few of her more recent albums.
2,She can do it much better,"I love Mya, she's very talented and her soft voice is suited for success, she never got the big breakthrough like i predicted though, and to be honest this album is pretty average. It's dissapointing since she got loads of talented and could hit it big with the right producers and songwriters. On this album there are a few notable one's though. ""Case of the ex"" her hitsingle was a decent song i still hear from time to time, also the great collaboration with Left Eye(Rest in peace) on ""Takin me over"" which is a catchy pop-soul song, most songs are actually soulish mid tempo here, a few ballads like ""Man of my life"" and very few uptempo songs. After the success with ""Lady Marmelade"" i hope her next album will be better made and include some more quality then this one, cause as i said before she got what it takes to make it big."
3,Great Adventure,Great adventure tale but there is a little too much Hero Worship on the part of the author. Overall if you are seeking an interesting true-life adventure you will not be disappointed.
4,NOBILE'S STORY,"While exploring the polar regions in 1928, Nobile and a group of fellow adventurers crashed in the airship Italia. One can imagine the horrors of being stranded in the artic for a short time, but the expedition is not rescued for over a month, and face the cold, bears, and breaking ice in addition to their injuries.The reader will find the rescue story exciting enough, but in many ways this is Nobile's story. The commander, against his will, is rescued first, only to be blamed for this by Italian authorities, who proceed to wage a media campaign aimed at destroying his reputation. The reader may wonder how Nobile kept his sanity throughout it all. The cynical nature of the governments involved was but a small foretaste of what was to come in the next two decades."
4,READ the directions!!! Great replacement for Toro/Homelite string Trimmer!,"Got this product because I was tired of winding two spools in one - while watching someone else load their trimmer with one pre-cut length of trimmer cord; I thought, ""Why not me?"" So I went shopping ~ or rather, my fingers did...I did read the directions - but I could not think why the manufacturer would keep the old, upper-half, of the rotating housing. DON'T QUESTION IT!!! Just do EXACTLY as the instructions tell you to - and you will be pleased; quick and easy reloads with a slightly heavier head. (PS - Yes, you can edge with the new head)"
1,Cheap and shoddy construction,"This product is cheap, and of shoddy construction - purchased about 4.5 months ago and right arm of chair literally snapped offThis produst is cheaply made, and you get what you pay for.Contacting warranty support is a nightmare"
2,Cheaply made and hard to assemble,"This product is cheap, but if you have hardtime assembling, it's not for you. First, didn't even camewith instructions. Second, to assemble it you need to work on8 different parts, many should be screwed in using Elm-headscrews. Don't attempt without an electronic screwdriver! Some ofthe screwes are really hard to put in.This produst is cheaply made, but it *is* cheap. You getwhat you pay for."
3,Great...SO FAR!,"Read other reviews on this product...must say that assembly did take about 1.5 to 2 hours. Many of the screws were hard to ""get in"" and it definitely took the two of us to get it done.As for the price...reasonably priced, somewhat comfortable, and who knows how it will hold up. As the cliché says: ""You get what you pay for."" So far, it's been a life-saver for a small businessowner on limited budget. We'll see if it was a good investment."
4,Good Basic Bass,"After I recommended one to a friend, I got one myself. The online reviews are generally good for this bass, and it's a good buy. The setup was good and it sounded good right out of the box. The strings are cheap and don't help, which can be expected in an economical instrument. I plan to replace them soon with Fender Nylon Tape Wound Strings, which will take this bass into another category. Some of the online reviews mention that the electrical parts are weak and won't last too long. I like to do upgrades, so the pots will be changed for standard Fender CTS pots. So, between the strings, pots and a Switchcraft jack, for under $30 in upgradesFender Accesories 073-9120-406 Nylon Bass Guitar Strings, LightI'll have a good basic bass."
5,"Don't own the set, but loved the season",Do you know that you can buy this set on the TLC website for about $30?
4,Asymetrical operations in the Pacific- World War II,"This book provides a good familiarization with a part of history that is often over-looked. There are other books that provide a more in-depth study of a single element of the Pacific war like the coastwatchers,or the Phillipino guerrillas,or the American Nisei but this book covers the various groups working to defeat the Japanese in a single interesting volume."
4,"Entertaining, at least.","This book was a fun little read...Okay, it passed the time. It could be a little confusing if read in parts, as one's memory may not hold onto names so well and things skip around a little bit. I can't say how factual it was, but I certainly wouldn't ever use it as basis for a scholarly work. The little interjected tokens of personal stories are cute, if not citable. All it all, worth it if you're looking for something to read. A great post-graduation book (those lazy pre-job days go a long way to reminding former students that there is such a thing as recreational reading)"
5,great book to read!,"what a great writer, there is no better poetry, so descriptive and so exhilarating to read"
5,Tull's Masterpiece,"This is the best thing Jethro Tull ever did, and it's also my all-time favorite album. You might say it's pretentious except that pretension implies unfulfilled ambition. You'll find none of that here; Tull deliver heroically on every level. ELP, Yes, and most of the other prog bands were pretentious. They sounded silly sometimes because they took themselves really seriously. I think it's funny how those bands, whose members were often classically trained, tried so hard to be sophisticated and profound, and then Ian Anderson, a blues flute player with no musical education at all, beat them at their own game while making fun of them at the same time. Tull had a sense of humor about progressive rock which, combined with their overall superior musicianship, resulted in success where others would have made fools of themselves. With Thick as a Brick the spoof surpassed the spoofed."
4,Stick around for the bonus track,"Tull struggled to sustain the level of invention and listener involvement over the course of this one. It certainly has its moments, however, the real prize here is the 12 minute live distillation, from N.Y 1978. This has all of the essential moments from the album, seamlessly joined, and, played with no little abandon. This one rocks."
5,As if it needs any more praise heaped upon it...,"I've been listening to ""Thick"" almost every day for months, and it just keeps getting better. It is the only rock album I've ever been tempted to call a masterpiece. Tull is still around (albeit with a very different lineup), but nothing they've done recently can match the raw energy and genius of their work from the early '70s. This album represents the high point of that era.Even if you already own an older version of the CD, it's worth getting this new one for the bonus tracks. The live performance of ""Thick"" is truly inspired, although it inevitably skips over some of the best parts of the original epic song. The interview at the end of the disc is full of amusing anecdotes and thick British accents. Plus, the liner notes contain some additional fake news articles."
4,Where the Hell was Biggles when I needed him last Saturday?,"I really like Tull, but (evidently unlike many), I didn't see God while listening to this. JT has made some really great albums and a few mediocre ones; this one's good, but not great. It does have its moments/movements tho. But, in its entirety, just a little bit too pretentious and drawn-out for my taste. The good parts are very good, however. If you find an ""excerpt"" of this album on a Tull collection, you've probably got 90% of the best material. In fact, this is an album that was made to be excerpted.I'd suggest ""Stand Up,"" ""Benefit,"" ""Minstrel in the Gallery,"" ""Aqualung"" or one of the many Tull collections for anyone other than a hard core fan - in which case you'd have this anyway."
2,NOT my favorite Jethro Tull at all,"Unlike many Tull fans, I'm not a big fan of the Thick As A Brick album. It's just to grandiose for me. Maybe I just don't have the attention span required to listen to one song for two LP sides. For me, the radio-edit version found on Original Masters is better. My favorite things on this CD are the 11 minute live version recorded in New York City and the interview/commentary. I'll always keep this CD because it's considered a ""must have"" for Jethroheads, and I am a big fan of the band, but this is one of their albums I don't listen to very often."
3,"Starts good, than dwindles on the 2nd half.","Am i the only one who wishes that this album was split into different songs? Oh well, on with the review.I never REALLY got into Jethro Tull. I had Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, and Stand Up. What I liked about the other 2, is that the songs were short and sweet. This album seems to go on forever, even for a 43-minute epic. (And yes, I do listen to long songs and love them, like Yes's Close To The Edge and ELP's Tarkus) It seems that Jethro Tull wanted to put in all the quirkiness and all the weird poetry they knew, and focused less on writing. I don't know why, but this just doesn't work for me. The first half is fine, but it starts to die down with revised ideas and stupid LONG parts near the end. I like the orchestrated parts and the ending in the 2nd part, but it's kind of dull. People should start with Stand UP, Benefit, or Aqualung before this album. End review."
5,Endlessly fascinating,"Like other reviewers I find the longevity of this record unmatched. The music moves with such skill and diversity, but most of all pure confidence. I have to listen to it at least twice whenever I put it on. Creativity was just wilder back then, and like the music, the LP cover is more entertaining than a dozen contemporary CDs.As of today TAAB has 13 reviews, Dark Side of the Moon has 864. I am truly among the elite. To be fair, I guess Mike Oldfield is a far better comparison. Oldfield once made the best music of this kind - his first three albums. A great recent one-number prog-rock concept album would be Green Carnation's 'Light of Day, Day of Darkness'. So, find this album somwehere, and give it to your personal weird, pot-smoking buddy - positive results guaranteed."
4,"A puzzling epic, yet nicely put together","I admit it was creative and considerate for them to make the album cover look like the front page of a newspaper. They probably figured that's what would draw readers' attention to the themes that the album is centered on. Just imagining the Society For Literary Advancement disqualifying the boy for reading a controversial poem, because it is considered unwholesome towards life, his God and country signals to readers what this might be about. The lyrics are extremely difficult to comprehend with countless metaphors and imagery, but I'm still trying my best. Other than that, the composition is brilliant."
5,Speechless,"Wow. Period.This is an amazing song. I listen mostly to rap music, so this is not quite what I usually listen to...I think my music tastes have changed since listening to this song/album....I can't stop moving to it. Just wild....great track."
3,Worth it...perhaps!,"This recording comes so very close to being a jazz classic. There is something missing however.Either it is something Louden and group forgot or something he (they) need to learn. I like themusicianship and some of the composition components, but I would like to talk to Louden beforeI listen to the recording again."
3,strange relax music,"not a trascendental work as the early soft machines, but a unique kitsch gem from the doom jazz rock era....now it seems an elegant, cool autoparody of that type of music...maybe is the forgotten masterpiece of the elevator music genre"
3,Pleasant But Uneventful,"This was the last release for the Softs, and barely recognizable as a Soft Machine product. The monniker had always been a great brand name for jazz inflected progressive music. The music here is melodic, safe, and would not be out of place as TV themes, Muzak (wouldn't offend a patient in a dentist office), or as any background type thing in general. There is not much edgey quality to it, that was always a Softs trademark. The sax work from Dick Morrissey is too mainstream and pretty for this band. Jack Bruce however is in fine form on fretless bass. Alan Holdsworth gets star billing, but his prescence is rarely felt. Still a pleasant and polite record.Fusion fans looking for something more challenging need to here the ""numbered"" (Soft Machine through ""Seven"")records, and ""Bundles"" which is pretty good also."
5,Beware my power...,"I have to admit it. Anytime I see Doug Moench and Paul Gulacy's names together I've got to get it. They could write and draw on toilet paper and I would purchase it. They've consistently put out such an excellent body of work, they are a sure bet when you're looking for something VERY good to read. I had purchased this book when it first came out, but after moving was unable to locate it. I was extremely pleased to see that someone was offering it. I became a fan of their work at Marvel and have followed them wherever they've been published. As such, I've had the opportunity to see them shine in a number of diverse fields. Solid storytelling and very dynamic artwork. And this book definitely falls into that category."
5,An awesome cd from an awesome band!,This is a great cd and well worth the import price. Super Zero has their own unique sound and anyone who is a fan of good rock music won't be disappointed.
4,"Invocative, but loses its spice.","I have read several books by Jack Hart, and Heat is fasinating and invocative. When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Hart goes into great detail describing the charaters, but it backfired of him this time. About 2/3 into the book, I though I would die if I read about one more blond head, blue eyed person. It appears that Hart ran out of pictures in his head to write about. The premise is that these are true stories, but it becomes obvious that Hart was creating these stories himself. It took away from the erocticism. For these who love to endulge in autoeroctocism, this could be one of the better books on the market. I really enjoyed my time with the book once I overlooked the flaws."
4,Not too shabby,"High quality product that has lasted me over 6 months now without any wear. Chips like a boss, and the handle is still like Day 1. The only downside is that the sheathe doesn't stay on well, otherwise I'd have given it a 5/5."
4,Well Made Pick,This pick looks to be well made. Its handle is large enough that I can hold it without too much difficulty.
5,Ice Pick,A very sturdy ice pick with a wooden sheath. It has a thick metal cap for safety during hard use.
4,Feedback,Good service - bought as a gift and recipient loved them - packaged pretty good but one stopper was broken
2,These will never work as perfume bottles,"They are extremely flimsy, and have no extra glass at the bottom to hold them steady. A soft breeze is liable to knock over your bottles and spill perfume all over your table.Also, the little metal rods that are supposed to reach down and let you access the perfume are very poorly made, and they don't come anywhere close to reaching the bottoms of the containers. So once your bottle was 1/2 empty, you wouldn't be able to access the perfume anymore without upending the entire bottle against your palm or something.Also, they are just sort of shoddily made. The glass is not blown very well and there is cheap looking blotchy paint accents on a couple of pieces.They are somewhat passable as EMPTY window decorators, perhaps, but I can't think of any other use."
5,great knife,"Brand reputation and previous case purchases were my primary considerations in purchasing this knife. Will last a long, long time"
1,ngk plugs,They were incorrect for a qmb-139 engine.mmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmm
2,Parts missing,"The spark plugs were the correct size; however, they were missing the top piece that allows the plugs to better fit into the wiring harness. I had to purchase different spark plugs to obtain the necessary top pieces to fit the wiring harness."
5,"Came promptly, but...","... I somehow ordered the wrong spark plugs. I got the same number from my old ones and somehow managed to order different ones. Yeah... oh well, these are cheap, only out a few burritos.Product is great."
5,Perfect match,"There's no excuse not to use high quality parts when you can find them at great prices on Amazon.com. I tried using another manufacturer's ""equivalent"", but it just didn't deliver the spark that the original NGK plug did in my little ATV. The ""other"" plug was brand new. In fact I had ordered two and tried them both. Neither would fire the engine. When I plugged in the NGK, the engine fired up on the first kick. I'm sold and think you will be too!"
5,The Beauty Of Reflection: Life Inspired Poems,"This I a wonderful book I have really enjoyed reading it, Jaclyn Gray is truly a wonderful author. You can tell that by her work there is so much love and feeling. Bravo Jaclyn you have touched my heart with your words."
3,Dirt cheap card for older AGP systems,"If your computer only has an AGP graphics card slot, this is pretty much the cheapest card available. It will power modern monitors (only natively supports VGA although you can use a converter to DVI), even at resolutions up to 1920x1200. It's not going to play modern games, but for powering a monitor or playing games prior to 2004, it will work just fine.PROS:CheapSupports up to 1920x1200 resolutionsCONS:No DVI outOnly one monitor connectionPoor graphics performanceConclusions:Suitable to older computers that need a replacement graphics card and use a VGA monitor. Not recommended for today's games, dual monitor configurations, or DVI monitors."
4,Works Great,"I was looking for a low priced video card That would work in a AGP card slot, at the same time work with a new wide screen monitor. This works great with a 1440 X 900 pixel resolution wide screen monitor."
3,Most people dont understand,"Karl Bartos was in several pop based bands prior to kraftwerk,This is his return to that same sort of Genre.His album released before this, (not esperanto, but his self title) was in this same genre.Bartos, and Fluer (ex-kraftwerk aswell) are doing some recording however, Fluer came and injected his own electronic percussion genious, and some degree of passionless vocals for some of the more synth based tracks.Just becuase Bartos put his Moog down and picked a guitar for a while doesnt mean he cant switch back, take a look a Pete Shelley from the Buzzcocks, he did solo syunth stuff, and shelleydevoto, and still recorded with the buzzcocks.All in all thoguh, id say that for what Bartos was going for this is enjoyable."
4,FAQ: Karl Bartos - 15 Minutes of Fame,"1. Does this sound like Kraftwerk? Yes, similar.2. Is it a song I can play on a loop? Yes, that's what I do.3. Will I say I like it? Most likely, yes.4. Did Karl really sell out his synths and took on guitars and real acoustic drums? No, that's not true. Track is made on synths and Karl's voice is the only link to analogue world,5. What is the song about? It is related to Andy Warhall's (long time Kraftwerk icon) concept of 15 minutes of fame for everyone. ""What's your claim to fame?""6. Can I also find this song on some of Karl's albums? Yes, it's a part of his 2003 ""Communication"" album.In fact, I would give this single 4 1/2 stars but there's no such an option here."
3,Poor quality but fun anyway,"This Cd would be considered a guilty pleasure. Although the sound quality is horrible the overall fun feeling of the cd makes it a fun ride. There are much better titles that showcase the talent of Dr. John, but the live feeling on several of the tracks give you a sense of good ole nawlins jazz. Track 6 is soooo bad it would qualify for the ""worst"" hall of fame. What were they thinking? Too many late nights and booze. If you just accept that it is bad and roll with it you can actually enjoy it. Track 1 sets the tone and others keep it going. I really like this title despite the obvious flaws."
3,For a diehard Dr. John fan only,"There are three notable tracks on this release. ""Swanee River Boogie"" is classic Dr. John boogie - very enjoyable. The ""Medley"" is interesting for its rendition of ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"". And the title song ""Hollywood Be Thy Name"" wears surprisingly well - most such religious ""spoofs"" wear thin by the third time through; while this is not a great track the fact that it doesn't become a bad track is a significant feat."
5,Excellent music from an obscure band,"I heard this band while sitting in a small cafe in Queenstown, New Zealand during the spring of 2003 and was immediately drawn to their deep sound. I asked the cook who was playing and wrote down the name, thinking that finding their music would not be a problem. Little did I know that getting a copy of ""Crazy on the Weekend"" is a bit of a chore, but once you get it, it will be worth it. This is the best obscure album I have ever heard. It is too bad this was their only offering, although the singer has recently release as EP with the band Clayhill. Do yourself a favor, pick this Sunhouse disc up and pass it around to all your friends. Music this good deserves to be shared."
3,Wonderful and enilightening,The book is very informative as to the history of thinking of the church and its modern day views towards homosexuality. Excellent for parents struggling with the issue.
4,Good Stuff From 2 Geniuses,"What do you get when you take to avant-pop autuers and get them to co write an album? I guess this album. Not as amazing as each artist's solo efforts, but I dig it. It has a little more fun than normal Kramer work, and a little more melancholy than Dogbowl offers. All in all, a great segueway album between their solo work."
4,Amazing photographs,"This book has some really amazing photography, they have a really powerful message. I like photos that make me feel something and Robert Capa's photos difinatly do that. Robert Capa was in the right place and the right time with alot of his photos. The only thing the book lacked i feel is more background on the photos."
5,Life After Baby: What it's really like!,"Life After Baby is an invaluable resource for new mothers and mothers of young children. I wish this book had been around when my son was born! (He is now 5.) Unlike other books about motherhood that stick with the facts, try to allay concerns or answer a myriad of questions, Life After Baby is about how it feels to be a mother--and all the attendant joys and fears. The author interviewed lots of women and brings their voices to the pages. Their experiences, their questions, their beliefs, their confusion, their love, all spill out from the chapters. I found the book thought-provoking and as I read it I felt less alone, less isolated. Motherhood is so exhausting and after reading this I felt energized. I highly recommend it for anyone who has pondered the meaning of motherhood! It would make a great gift for a new mom."
5,superb!,THE Colorful ventures is out standing ! when you put on the song cherry pink and apple Blossum white it will send chills up your spine and make the hair stand on end on your arms! nokie edwards shows his expertise on this one. surfing is a wonderful album the guys do it right on that one wet reverb! YEAH
4,microlite book,"G'day,This is a very good book, and any aspiring ultralite/microlite pilots should read this.Armin Hubert."
4,A novice's opinion,"Received this about 3 months ago. The electronic tuner was damaged, but I contacted the seller (zZounds I think) and they sent me a new one free of charge. I've only been learning guitar for 3 months, so I can't attest to how this guitar compares to others, but it does the job for me. Guitar feels pretty solid and it stays in tune for about 2 practice sessions (~hour long)."
4,Good starter set,"I've been learning to play for a month and have been satisfied with this guitar and amp. The set has good value and the finish of the guitar is better than I expected; the sunburst body could pass for high-quality wood. The amp occasionally has some static, but overall it sounds clear and is powerful for its size, with a cool overdrive feature that gives a raw tone (and is more forgiving of mistakes).One thing missing from the set was a pack of picks. That's no big deal since they're cheap and it's good to buy several of different sizes and thicknesses to see what suits you. The instructional video is helpful, but should be supplemented with another such as the good one by Fender. Overall, this is a fine set for the beginner and one that I would recommend."
3,Silvertone SSL3 Electric Guitar Pack,"Well, the guitar is fine. It produces good soundThe problem is the amplify. It is terrible, I can even hardly plug the cable in and the sound is fuzzy.Guitar is fine, Amplify sucks"
4,CLASSY THIRTIES FLICK,"Diane Lovering (Crawford) is the mistress of Richard Field (Otto Kruger). It is a quiet dignified love Field has for his former secretary; Field's wife won't agree to a divorce because of their children. Field sends Diane on a cruise to Buenos Aires until things ""clear up""; while on the cruise, Diane meets Mike Bradley, a rich rancher from Argentina (and he's played by Clark Gable)..................A splendidly written, acted, directed and photographed movie done in MGM's best thirties style. Joan Crawford in the moonlight on the open sea appears quite seductive and Gable seems to agree. In the as the spurned lover, Gable demonstrated a new dimension of his acting skills and the critics were impressed in 1934; Otto Kruger is superb as the New York businessman."
3,Warning!,This is a DVD-R transfer and a part of the Warner Archive Collection. It is available directly from the Warner Archive site for only $19.95. Why pay more?
1,"so pretentiously boring, and definitely will bore you to death","terrible! i was fooled by some critics' high praises to this movie and tried pretty hard to seek this movie out. but doom on me, this movie is so pretentious, so ridiculous, so snail-crawling slow. the screenplay is also deadbeat. whole movie with amber lens painted everything in brownish color. the dialog, my god, it's also so boring and i often found myself couldn't keep my attention to what's going on. if you tried to tell me it's so good, so deep, so.....then you must be from another planet. i don't mind admitting that i couldn't grasp the least meaning, the reason why this movie could be realized into production. watching it is exactly like reading john le carre' deadbeat novels, every one of them. i won't give a rat's a.. whether this serial killer case could be solved or not, because i don't want to be murdered by this movie, by its extreme serial boredom. i better rest my case before it's too late."
4,Lars is a scary genius,"Lars von Trier is a provocatuer film maker and you can see the roots of that persona in his first major film, Tlement of Crime. Once you accept the conceit that the entire film is happening in the protagonist's subconcious under hypnosis, it all makes a startling kind of brutal sense. This is not ""sci-fi"" or ""futuristic"". It is a straightforward story of Europe at the end of the 20th century seen through a nightmarish veil. It's brilliant. I wish I admired all of his work as much as I like this film."
1,Terrible,"This is the most uncomfortable ankle support I have ever worn. The hemmed places all around the heal makes it impossible to walk with it on.. And I have fat feet and they swell at times but the part closest to the toe is very loose making it hard to put a sock on so you can give up any chance of wearing this for a walk.. Going back to the hem around the heel, it was uncomfortable and I just had it on with my feet elevated.. So even with no pressure it needs to be fixed.. I would not recommend this product and I regret buying this product.."
3,OK,"It lost it's elasticity almost immediately, before the first washing Ten More words? ten ten ten ten ten ten ten"
5,"easier fit for older, taller users",Easier to pull onto a wide leg--and more comfortable.My husband is over 6 ft. and had trouble with the products sold in pharmacy.
3,"Nice, well-made watch band, but..","The watchband is well made, but I have two minor complaints. First, it's not a true navy blue. It goes OK with navy and royal blue, though. The second is that the prong that goes through the hole to secure the watch makes the watch really hard to take off. I've even had to have my husband help me a couple of times. Nevertheless I kept it since the last navy blue watchband I had wore out really fast and navy blue is not easy to find. I don't want to spend too much on a watchband."
1,You are kidding right?,"First, watch the trailer. Why would anyone would spend a penny on telling this story? This couple are the reason for the current global mess we're in. Beyond belief...and my fault for thinking this was about the real French Queen."
4,Eye opening,"Great documentary. Made me never want to risk my money. If you are curious how sub prime loans impacted people , this doc is for you. It's also very entertaining!"
4,interesting look at how the (former) 1% lives,This was a very well done film. Quirky family -- portrayed in a way that made me both scratch my head in disbelief and feel some sympathy for their plight.
4,I found The Queen of Versailles compelling!,Very entertaining. Great riches to rags story. A peak into the sub-prime mortgage world & what caused the financial crash that we are just crawling out of now. Couple that with a peak in to a very dysfunctional family. I found is fascinating & have already recommended it to many. I love documentaries!
2,"Mildly interesting, but the people are awful.","It was mildly interesting to see the downfall of the company, and to see how the owner brings about the beginnings of a resurrection. However, the people are awful. Horrible parents. I read an early review that was something along the lines of ""you can see the love between the two..."" I didn't see the love. Hard to be sympathetic."
3,rags to riches to (almost) rags,watching this hedonistic/narcissistic documentary was painful. billionaire family totally reliant upon super easy credit for both themselves and their customers. when the crap hit the fan they were not able to understand the blessing they had had- when they had money it was spent when the economy and the easy credit era tanked they were not too well equipped to handle the disaster that unfolded.
3,A Sad Comment,"This film exposed the excesses of a couple who really had nothing but material interests. I thought Jackie revealed a sense of acceptance that she had practically nothing at the end (of the movie) and that the accumulation of the extraordinary extravagances meant nothing. As her niece commented, ""There's nothing normal about this life."" Yet, even though it seemed Jackie married for security, she appeared fond of her husband. Money can't buy everything."
3,Want to see the 7 Deadly Sins on Video?,This movie although a documentary setting showed the way to hell.Filled with self righteous plans to make money and control the world and insult people while doing it.The wife is a plastic saline filled baby maker who has children like a litter of dogs.Her self centered ways of denying the fact that she is a classless pig with fantastic price tag clothes is just the start. She tends to blame the bank while her poor-rich husband is living in depression and trying to save the empire he created from destruction.She on the other hand can not be bothered to even pick up a single dog turd or kids toy that she compulsively buys while they are on a budget.What a joke- want to see a horror film with humor- this is the one for you.
4,Noveau riche,"The movie shows the stereoptypical display of wealth of the noveau riche. In this instance the movie itself must have provided gratification to the Queen. Other than the fascination of the excesses the family engages in, the movie has little of lasting value."
3,How do you have so much/but so little?,"How is 26,000 square feet of space not enough for a family? How are you being filmed for a movie, but your house is a mess. How greedy can one possibly be? Who the ""HELL"" needs a 90.000 square foot home in AMERICA? Interesting but embarassing at the same time."
3,See it but maybe not buy it,"Well worth a watch if you have a timeshare - especially at o eof the ""Wastegate"" Resorts. This family isn't from this planet & it shows where all that money is REALLY going and it isn't to upkeep the resorts. I wouldn't watch it a second (or third) time so owning a copy makes little sense. Worth the rental cost but not the purchase."
4,Interesting take on the economy meltdown,"Pretty good documentary following this ""Real Housewife"" type....it's hard not to feel sorry for her at the end, even though all logic says you shouldn't."
3,Interesting Point of View,The film follows a wealthy American family around the time of the financial crisis who's dream of building the biggest house in America is put in jeopardy by the economic turmoil.
4,'When all the laughter turns to sorrow,"The movie sets you up with a somewhat amusing, light hearted beginning and then slowly takes you to open ended but depressing finish"
2,Documentary,A sad tale of a family falling apart when their finances fell apart. I didn't realize it was a documentary and kept waiting for a plot. Instead it was a cautionary tale of unwise business practices and people out of touch with reality when they became wealthy on paper. I hope they were able to get their life together and learn that wealth is fickle and fleeting - discovering what is eternal and the real treasure.
1,Disgusting!!!,I thought this was trash. Adults and children that have everything and can't even pick up after themselves or their pets.Disgusting!!
3,Ok but drags on a little,"This movie was ok. I felt like it began to drag a little towards the end. At some points, it was as if it was just a brag movie about their massive fortune. It would have been nice to have delved a little deeper into their family life and their life after the massive fortune was lost."
5,Human tragedy,"This story was very insightful. It showed the rise and fall of the wealthy and the debris field it leaves behind. The story tells of denial ,deceit and incineration of wealth and a man's identity."
5,Well done,"I can only describe this movie as entertaining and something that made me think about the people involved for many days after I finished watching. For a time, I felt sympathy for what they were going though, and I also felt they were in such a ""dream-world"" that they should have nothing to complain about.Overall, it was a well made documentary. Highly recommended."
1,Money can't buy class,"I was appalled at the lack of class shown by all the members of this family. Money. - no matter how much - cant buy class. I was also very disturbed at the deceitful selling practices of their business, more so because they bragged about them. Trash people all the way. Also appalling that these people are given a forum to feed their egos. Skip it."
2,Expected More,"I remember when I saw the first preview for this documentary while watching another film. I was seriously interested by what I saw, but when watching it was very let down."
4,What a group!,Interesting story that captures the greed and excesses that brought down the economy in the late 2000s and how money certainly doesn't equal taste or class. The one truth from this movie is that banks will screw everyone and they will always be taken care of and survive. A guess that makes them analogous to cockroaches.
2,Money is the root of all evil,"Thank goodness Romney lost!Assuming thet ever had any smarts, huge money has made these dopes unfeeling numbskulls.Put the dog on the roof. he'll be fine."
1,The Queen of Versailles,"Boring, boring. Just couldn't get past the first few minutes. By the title and description, I thought it would be interesting."
2,Flat. Rich people without a clue. The biggest joke is her chest.,Rich people without a clue. The biggest joke is her chest. They didn't learn a thing. . . . .
2,Just a bit too much input (output?) from the dogs,"Just a couple of things to point out. No, wait, that's not right. Well, anyway, this is one woman who cannot, CANNOT, seem to wear anything that does not show WAY too much cleavage. He doesn't seem to realize that a large part of his problems result from his own poor business decisions, and no one seems at all concerned that the dogs are crapping all over the house. I'm not saying that it's not interesting, but it certainly doesn't give you an uplifting (oh dear)view of one family's problems."
1,Pathetic,"I read all the outstanding reviews of this documentary and looked forward to watching it. I was watching it last night in anticipation of some sort wrong doing or human fragility. It's a pathetic attempt at pity cause the floor got pulled from under them before they finished their 900,000 sq. ft mansion! For one, to the millions of people who lost their jobs and homes over the past 4 years, me being one. This is a complete insult to the "" normal"" class of people and for the life of me cannot figure out what the person who made this was thinking. No one cares of the trials and tribulations of the ubber rich and it's this type of trash TV that's responsible for the dumbing down of America."
3,Real Wife of Orlando,"This documentary of a super successful businessman's family is very fascinating and seems truthful, too. The family is pretty dysfunctional, brings to mind the Osbournes with lots of dogs pooping on the precious carpets."
3,Interesting if your interested in topic of bigt business and billionaires,Interesting decline of a business empire and the way differing members of the family deal with it. Leaves you conflicted in how
5,Know what? I like them,"Is this a great movie? No. Is this a great family? No. Are they individually doing the very best they can? Yes. I despised them in the first half hour, couldn't wait for them to fail. Well, I'm hoping for them now. They are just ordinary people, who lived an extraordinary life and, when adversity came, dealt with it. There is real pain here, real courage. Good Luck to all of them."
4,The Queen of Versailles,I liked this movie because it seemed to give an honest depiction of a family going through a crises that was not anticipated when the project started.
2,Interesting,"Decided to watch this, but I would not recommend it. It really was not entertaining but a few things were interesting"
5,Really fascinating,"Definitely worth two hours of your time. This film was much more interesting than I expected. If you can stream it for free, you have no excuse!"
3,OK Movie,"Crazy wealth... Interesting how people with this type of money cant (really) do anything without an assistant, maid, driver, nanny, etc"
3,"A NANNY FORCED TO GIVE UP HER CHILDREN, WHILE THE TASTELESS DIVA WEARS PRADA","Here's the worst form of indulgence....allowing one of their nanny's to slave for years taking care of their children, while never caring about the fact that this nanny's own children had to remain in the Philippines...to be raised by other people. Really? 'With that amount of money, they could not have offered to bring this nanny's children to the States to live with their mother? I'm willing to bet that just 10 of Jacquie Siegel's Prada purses per year would have paid for that expenditure. I find that to be callous and indifferent.The only thing I can say in her favor is that she seemed to take their ""reversal of fortune"" (all relative of course)in stride."
3,Hard to feel sorry for these people,"A mantra of ""everything to excess"" makes it difficult to feel sorry for billionaires on an allowance because they overextended themselves."
4,Sad...,"But really, really funny on so many levels. And like a lot of great documentaries, not neccessarily on purpose! Regardless, if you're a fan of the ""serious to them/funny to us"" ambush style (and I am!) documentary - this one is dead on."
5,great doc,it would be easy to label these people negatively. A surprisingly touching and warm profile of a family with more money than good taste.
2,Good idea (In Theory),"The eyeTV is a neat idea, but I have not had a good experience. After two broken eyeTV's and hundreds of dollars in shipping, and hours of fighting with customer service. I think ill wait until the technology is perfected before I buy another one.It wouldnt be so bad if it was my fault (like if i dropped it) but I didnt do a thing. It sits beside my imac and doesnt move. Yet on two occasions with two different eyeTV's, I have gone to use it, and discover that it has just completely stopped working."
5,I like it,As a recent convert from PC's I had used another brand tuner in Windows. The Tyetv 200 is a much better product and I was up and running a few minutes after opening the box. Te biggest selling point was the firewire connection as I use a laptop and have limited USB ports.Good picture and sound quality. I would recommend this to an yone that wants a good tuner for their MAC.
3,Sexy Shoe,"This is a really sexy shoe, perfect for a wedding or a short night out. I was surprsed that the elastic strap was comfortable and stayed in place so well. However, I do caution that this is not a long standing or dance all night shoe. Half way through the reception I had to remove them, but hey so did most of the other guest."
2,Beautiful Bag - Horrible Quality,"I'm not sure I even need to rate this purchase since Kecci has shut down operations and no one will care soon! The second day I had this bag, the strap broke at the clasp, which seems to be really cheap plastic. The replacement strap came in and the same thing happened when I tried to connect it to the bag! I had to cut the good hook off of the old strap and attach it to the new one and get it all sewn back together. I don't know if this is a common thing - but be careful if you buy a used one."
2,As much as how comfortable it was...,"...initially when I put it on, I didn't know how much it hurt my feet until I wore it for a full day (on carpet, so that I could actually keep it in good shape and return it just in case). I was limping on the way home, and I had to take it off at around 11AM."
4,Excellent book for getting to grasps with basics of ECGs.,"This book is written for medical students, nurses, paramedics - anyone who may be involved in interpreting ECGs in clinical practice and whom might not have the best knowledge of physics. It teaches interpretation without necessarily understanding all the physics involved. It is only a little book, yet covers a suprising amount. It helped me to understand ECGs better for my third year MBChB exams."
2,same as 5th ed.,This a pretty good reference for basic EKGs. Easy to read and refer to but the 6th ed has very little change from the 5th ed. I have them both. Basically prettier paper and a slight change in the books layout; otherwise it is word for word as the older 5th ed.
2,Nothing great either,"As I stated in other reviews, most of the ECG books on the market are nothing impressive. This was obviously another book I ordered and sent it back. I'm not sure why it's so hard to find books on this subject that are worth the money?"
4,Brutal and bizarre,"Poor Norma, Sandy and Louise. The three Field sisters growing up in 1960s suburban Toronto live in a gloomy, comfortless world. Their father is demanding, difficult, and has dalliances on the side, and their mother, who dropped her baby son over the Niagara Falls many years ago, seeks solace in alcohol. The girls are the ones who take care of her and the house, going for groceries, cooking and cleaning, and trying to stop her from heading for the roof. But one day, one early morning, she does, and they cannot stop her.Barbara Gowdy seems to like the weird, the eccentric, the crazies. Falling Angelsis a tale of a dysfunctional family, with weird and unexpected events that lurk around every corner. It is a sad life these girls lead, and they each have their own coping mechanisms to deal with their family's problems, resulting in a book that is dark, honest, brutal, a little bizarre and funny at the same time."
4,good,"Hi,I like this product,Thank's for your attention and excellent efficiency, 100 % recommendedAtt .Manuel MarquezVenezuela"

2,Disappointing and outdated; wonderful pictures though!,"As a new Amazon owner I was looking for a species-specific book that would give me detailed information about my blue-front. Unfortunately this book seemed superficial, simplistic, and somewhat out-dated (with some information actually contrary to what is widely recommended now). It has some wonderful pictures, and fragments of useful species information, but overall I think there are better general care books available (certainly more detailed), and this book's Amazon-specific information was sketchy."
2,I wouldn't recommend this book for newbie owners of parrots,Not enough information provided. Suggest investing in a better book with more details
4,Good reading for anyone considering owning an amazone parrot,A fairly comprehensive description ofthe behavior and lifestyle of amazoneparrots. Its a good owner's handbookfor owning one of these exotic birds.A must reading for anyone consideringowning an amazone parrot.Supported with pictures
4,works great,I have used this for years. I believe it was created for the original flat screen imac (the one with swivel screen). Now I use it in conjunction with a griffin powerwave.
1,No CD with book!,I purchased this book and cd set and was not sent a CD at all. I was sent a book only. The item received was not the one pictured in the image. I do not recommend purchasing this.
5,Ideal Read for Saggy Baggy Babies!,"Great little story about understanding yourself and who you are. I remember this from when I was a child and just had to get it for my son. The idea is very simple, very clear and timeless."
3,Wow,When i was a baby my mom use to read this to me its about a elephant who trys to get rid of his bags and sags
4,Grace's Review,"I liked this book because at the end the big elephants saved him. This book is about a baby elephant named Sooki. He tore apart the jungle when he danced. He didn't know what kind of animal he was, and that made him very sad. The other animals teased him for how he looked. He didn't like his saggy baggy skin and tried to make it fit. One day he let out a trumpeting bellow when he was frightened by a tiger and thats when all the other elephants came to his rescue and he realized he was not alone!"
5,The best song ever written goes GCDC!,"This album is that fun kind of goofy that you find on a Zappa album and even has similar occasional bites of social commentary. The music is tight and interesting, and Penn's vocals are much better than I expected from a guy who spent years yelling in the carny. My favorite thing about the album is that it is absolutely transparent everyone involved was having a blast. I also recommend listening to their other album Music Feeds My Money Machine. That one has a few fun covers on it."
5,Unusual and intriquing,"Like Catch-22, this book fluctuates between a comedy and a tragedy. Early on, it isn't clear who the main character is, but that shakes out as the characters develop. You have to root for her. The twists and turns are unpredicatable which is a great change from so many other novels."
5,A Timeless Study of Childhood,"This was one of my father's favourite books, and the lucky person who gets to read this instantly sees why. Although it's many years since my one and only reading, the extraordinary 'story' qualities of this novel are a long way from being forgotten, or surpassed in other novels I've since read. However, the most striking element of the book, without any doubt, is the remarkable accuracy and simplicity with which Richard Hughes represents the world of children, the protagonists. Never have I read such a perfect description of the motives for children's actions, their perception of facts and deeds, and the accompanying dialogue. Complementing this is the reaction of adults, their own surprise, and quite simply one of the most spellbinding stories to plunge into. This book cannot be recommended enough."
4,I like it.,"A very strange story, but intriguing. Great sailing descriptions. Great analyses of the minds of children. I bought this on Kindle, but it might be worth having in print."
3,Epic adventure with a dark undercurrent,"Colonial Jamaican high sea adventures in late 19th century seen through the eyes of displaced children whose not yet matured mind and rich imagination altered their and others' lives. This well penned classic is hard to categorized and grasp; it has the very construct of an epic adventure, yet deeper, the theme of perverted innocence percolates."
1,Kindle version unreadable,"I'd like to read it, but it is too difficult with all the crazy characters in my Kindle edition. This has happened to me enough times that I am starting to revert to buying cheap used books (which have the benefit of being sharable)."
2,boring,"The characters, the plot, and everything else in this book are extremely boring. The only thing keeping this from a 1 star book is the character Emily. She alone has creative and unique thoughts floating around in her head. I'm glad I read it because she amused me so much. But as for the rest of the book, it was not worth writing, and the ending was infuriating."
3,Just Enough Wind To Keep Sailing,"This book barely kept my interest. Altho I have to admit I was chuckling quite a bit about 3/4 the way thru. The ending is climactic. If you give this book a chance, it is worth reading. And remember, just as there are kids who are idiots, there are also adults who are as well."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I am a big Jan and Dean Fan. They WERE great but the newer cuts on this album are really bad. Not meaning to dis Jan but his choice of ""songs""(?) is bad. I admire him for his strength of soul to come back and work but the ""music"" is really not good. I LOVE the original Jan and Dean works."
5,A Hazard of Hearts,"A Hazard of Hearts was viewed many times in our household. It is a fun and dramatic story of bad fortune meeting destiny. A girl won in gamble, a heart lost, but a heart found. Our whole family has enjoyed this classic many times. It would be wonderful to see this title available on Amazon for our copy is very warn."
4,Helena Bonham-Carter battles a most wicked Diana Rigg...,"Filmed for British cable in the early 90's, this was one in a series of four movies based on the romantic period novels of Dame Barbara Cartland. A HAZARD OF HEARTS is the tale of innocent-yet headstrong Serena Staverley (Helena Bonham-Carter), whose hand in marriage is gambled away by her father in lieu of a debt to disgusting lecher Lord Wrotham (Edward Fox). Serena is saved by Lord Justin Vulcan (Marcus Gilbert) only to fall prey to his cruel mother Lady Harriet (Diana Rigg), the sword-wielding leader of a group of smugglers.There is a lot of enjoyable mystery, intrigue and romance in this exceptional Barbara Cartland adaptation. Also featuring Christopher Plummer, Fiona Fullerton, Eileen Atkins, Anna Massey, Gareth Hunt and Neil Dickson."
4,A Hazard of Hearts,"I was pleased with this product, and the ease with which I received it, as I have had trouble before with other sites. It arrived on time and worked without issue!"
1,Deceiving Title,"The book teaches you to write VB code for .NET and not how you can connect to database using Flash (through web-services, XML, etc.) Total waste of money and the examples focus on Access as a database; very poor knowledge on behalf of the authors. The flash portion is so limited, it took me a lot of time to find out the actionscript code in the entire book. The examples are total junk and not at all useful for commercial development. Whoever gave five stars either know the author personally or have not come across any other worthy book (such as Flash MX Professional 2004 for Server Geeks) which discusses much more on how to access database services than this hopeless book here."
4,Fantastic and Easy to Follow Examples,"This book is chocked full of great examples. The sample code alone is a VERY usefull and worth the money that the book costs.It's for the beginning and intermediate Flash and ADO.NET person alike. It even goes into to detail about setting up your program and application delivery envoirnment. Very complete resource.The complaints I see from other reviewers shows me their limited knoweledge of Flash, .NET, and Action Scripting and it's use it the real world. I have a hard time believing any of them read this book. I believe they are here promoting their own agenda."
4,Useful Techniques,"I found this book very useful. It shows how to make the connection between flash and databases. Contrary to a couple of the reviews, I was able to use their example with SQL Server 2000 and ASP.Net. It showed me how to integrate flash easily into my user interface.My only gripe with the book is that it seems they cover to many technologies (ASP, ASP.net, Access, SQL). I can kind of understand why they did that, but I would have like more depth on my technologies."
4,Great!,This book has been a great reference to have on the shelf. It's helped me out more times than I can count.
5,Clear speak and more useful than I imagined a book could be.,"I learn entirely by reading books. I've never taken a class for anything I do professionally. So I know a good book when I read it. How informative and easy to understand can you get? This book is it.The text is spoken in plain english, easy to read, easy to understand. It's organized in an intelligent fasion. Not only does it make a great read through, but also serves as a reference manual when you've completed the training.The example code that is included FREE with this book, is worth WAY more than the cover price, for sure."
1,Very little of Flash,"This joke of a book is surely for people who want to use .NET. Totally agree with the reviewer who criticized this book. Not worth buying at all. There are much better books on .NET. If you are looking for Flash programming look elsewhere. This book is a waste of time and money. Most of the database work is being done by .NET and Flash is used only to make do some silly poor quality graphics. It is indeed a misnomer. Dealing with databases, Flash and .NET is certainly not the authors' cup of tea. The author needs to gain more experience in Flash/Database before attempting to write another book."
4,Freak Brothers comic,Weird little comic book I must say. Must be from the 60's. I have a 1971 book and a 1972 comic book and really do not understand what they are doing.
3,Mighty Nice,"An inspired collaboration between Gongmeister Allen and Bongwatermeister Kramer. Mr. Kramer tunes in nicely to a 70's Canterbury aesthetic and provides the requisite hipness/update for Mr. Allen's hippy-by-way-of-Paris-'68 aesthetic. Fans of either artiste's previous output will likely find themselves charmed by this set. I was, despite misgivings based upon ""The Big Sell-Out"" and the Gong reunion. An inspiring CD."
4,Good for the price,"The retail price listed on the tag ($88) is a fantasy price. These pants are not lined, a fact more noticeable given the thinness of the fabric. But they fit well. They are not as ridiculously generously cut for the size as some of the newer Jones of New York and Lauren by Ralph Lauren stuff (size is just a number but it is supposed to convery some consistency that is completely missing from the new clothing marketing framework).These pants are well worth Amazon's selling price ($17) but not the list price."
4,like my new pants...,i liked the pants...esp for the cost...but i do agree that the the pant doesn't look the original price of $88...it has a comfort fit and no prob with fitting...
3,Flight 29 Down,"I do recommend this book, because it has a lot of action and feeling. The book is mainly about 7 kids trying to find a way home off of the island and how to work together to stay alive by gathering food and water. Along the way the kids get into fights, they get hurt, and they try to learn how to deal with other kids when something bad gose wrong."
3,good,the crackers were very good but they were not low fat. That is what I thought I was buying.It has to say low fat on the box they are 3 grams of fat for 4 crackers
3,Frazetta-painting with fire,"Still cocky, Frazetta astounds us with his genius..along with an amazing group of fantasy illustrators. Some of the best. Worth watching, even if disappointed."
3,"A Bio, for older people to watch...but","This guy has done some amazing work with art. It has most all his artwork through the years, but if you want to sit through some long moments of ""where he came from"", then you will enjoy it. I have only seen it one time from my collection of art DVD's.Havn't wanted to sit throught it again.Im not sure if a teen could sit through this DVD. Buy used."
4,Painting With Fire; 2 Disc Collector's Edition DVD Set,"A Must Have for Frazetta Aficionados', A warm glance at the things he cherishes, takes note of as well as a glimpse of the challenges and stuggles he has met. It means to be simple without affectation of questionable intellectualism. And does succeed I think. Yet it is clear that his gifts remain undimmed by the trials visited apoun his health and times' nagging insistence that passionate men ought surrender to the inevitable. ""It follows suit nicely"" That just being himself brings out the genius of the human spirit in defiant efforts and heart felt play. It owns a four star rating naturally, super-naturally. It will be for others to raise it higher if such is needed. You have my own words herein in my attempt to do justice to it. It what it is, something of Frazetta."
5,Frazetta - A real living legend,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.Go behind the scenes and find out more about this wonderful man than you had ever expected to see on a DVD.It's well edited and covers Mr.Frazetta's whole career.It's segmented into various parts that covers different years of his life and art. It also has many interviews with other artists that have been influenced or have worked with Mr.Frazetta - it's a real insight.Do yourself a favour and buy this one. You'll love it!
4,Track listing,The track listing for this item is:1 Groovin' With You (Intergalactic Harbour Mix) (9:28)2 Journey (Remixed By DMX Krew) (5:00)3 Laurie's Theme (Remixed By Global Goon) (5:04)4 Soundtrack Of Life (Toy Bunny Mix) (2:56)
5,Never a problem,"I use this unit with the software supplied (Nero) with Win2K, on a 3-year-old desktop. I NEVER have had a problem. On the other hand, I struggled for 2 years with a far more expensive unit and CD Creator 5 (and all its patches and updates), and got nothing but frustration.Others have mentioned the speed issue: remember that the fastest advertised recording speed is only possible with USB 2.0, not 1.0, and when recording only some types of files."
4,"Buy it, study it, enjoy it!","Everything I ever wanted to know in great technical detail about transmitting, processing, and storing multimedia data. All the must-read papers organized and summarized in one handy (if not weighty) package."
1,Dislike,"My 6 year old & I both dislike this book. The character teaches total disrespect toward others and encourages one to be totally self-centered. The book encourages use of slangs and incorrect grammer. My 7 yr old niece uses ""stinky"" in every other sentence & thinks its funny-like Junie B! No"
1,We can offer better material than this!,"Why would we want to teach our children how to use poor english, disrespect their elders and call each other potty-mouthed names? With all the quality options for children's books out there, don't bother with this series. While the United States educational system struggles to teach children to read and write correctly, our schools offer them things like this. If you want to teach bad grammar and manners, go right ahead. It's such a shame. These funny stories could have been told just as well, without any schlock included. Thanks, but no thanks."
1,Horrible,"Page 10 ""Because of her big fat stomach - which is where the stupid baby is."" Page 11 ""And anyway, I don't even know its stupid dumb name."" Just a few examples of the words your child will be reading if you purchase this book. This character was quoted as being simply hilarious. Seriously? And we wonder why children are so rude, self centered and have no respect for any authoritative figure. The character in this book is not funny, she is an obnoxious brat!"
4,Junie B. Jones is great!,"I am in first grade, and I think Junie B. Jones is very funny! I enjoyed reading Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business. I like Grace. She is my favorite character. I would recommend this to other boys and girls who like Junie B. Jones! I am looking forward to reading Junie B. Jones has a Monster under her Bed."
4,Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business,"Junie B. Jones just got a baby brother. And her grandma told her ""for really and honest and truly""v that he was the cutest little monkey she saw. Does Junie B. have something to say on Show and Tell!"
1,Very Bad Image Quality,"The image quality of this DVD is HORRIBLE!!. I own the VHS version and this one has a much better image. Impro-Jazz did not care at all about the quality of this DVD, they just make a very bad copy of the VHS.In spite of that, this is is a very good concert; Sarah Vaughan is a great vocalist and she sings magnificently all the songs of this program."
5,Angel City - Night Attack AKA: The Angels,Early 80's Australian Rockers that should have been hugh in the USA. When I first heard this record I thought Epic records would get behind this band full throttle. Epic dropped the ball big time by not pouring money into this group in America. Thank god I was able to get 4 of their cd's from overseas. And to make matters worse. Some lame band using the same Angel City moniker forced them to go with the Angels instead.....Rock on the real Angel City.
1,This book is a misleading con,"This book is inaccurate, out of date and misleading. It should never have been published, but as it has been the ""author"" and publisher should at least have had the grace to acknowledge the fact that much of the content has been copied wholesale from previously published papers and web sites. It won't help anyone to make or understand holograms - its science is confusing and wrong, its techniques are even more confusing and inadequate.As an editor of a holography book myself I declare an interest, but I would have been pleased to see a good book on the topic. This book is not it. In fact, it's utter rubbish (how's that for a carefully reasoned response?)"
1,This is by far the worst book on holograms in print,"I believe this book does a great disservice to our industry bringing the worst ""Internet ethics"" into the realm of technical literature. It exploits the fact that there is a real need for a new book on this subject and cynically fails to deliver the goods, whilst disingenuously dressing up the package to make a quick sale. most of the text has simply been lifted from other sources (mostly the internet where one can read it for free) and is now several years out of date. The new reader would have no reason to suspect this, however, as in the author's ""end notes"" he cites his sources as being from the last couple of years. That might not matter, except that the world has moved on and it is now a little sad, to read chapters about building a studio for silver halide holography, as though we were in 1981 rather than 2001. It's like reading a typewriter manual, or a guidebook for Windows 3.1. - it's just not relevant anymore."
1,Should be zero stars,"This book is a real pity that it was ever published. Obviously this author has never made a hologram in his life, as he gives 20 year out of date processing details. But the big pity is that this book is a shameless ripoff of the web sites of Rudie Berkhout and Chris Outwater! Don't buy it!"
4,Well researched historical fiction,"Although this is not an ""easy"" read, it is quite fascinating. The integration of the history of psychology with the story line of two fictional pioneers in the field was extremely well done. I have a degree in psychology, yet found myself learning many new things about the bases of current psychological theory, and I completely enjoyed the trouncing of the Oedipal complex and other parameters of the ""Viennese"" school even though Freud was never mentioned by name. Faulks draws his characters with style and verve - he has a good handle on both conscious and subconscious motivations, so the people of his novel do come to life and earn a place in your heart."
3,Great in parts,"The action of this book takes place amid the both fascinating and horrifying setting of late 19th and early 2oth century psychiatry. When this remains the backdrop of the book and the characters are allowed to dominate the story, it's all good reading. However, I think that the the author's expectations of his lay-readers is too high when he chooses the format of long lectures and case studies to get across the information he wants to transmit about the different views psychiatrists of that era held when fathoming out the workings of the mind. At times,(quite a few of them), I felt as if I were being force-fed information. At other times I couldn't wait to find out what happened to the conflicted and close-knit group of people that Faulks brought to life so well."
4,Humanity more compelling than psychiatry,"This book had a lot going on at different levels - family stories, history of psychiatry, World War I - and more. It definitely would have benefited by tighter editing (e.g., removing some of the storylines that went nowhere, shortening the medical lectures and making them less pedantic). And some of the scientific suppositions are so prescient that they are not believable. But I was touched by the human side of the story. CAUTION, SPOILERS AHEAD. Having lost a child (though not in the manner of this book), the parents' sense of loss here brought me to tears. And the irony of a man who spent his life studying the human mind losing his, and being aware of his trajectory, was both heartbreaking and ironic."
2,Dissappointing,"Having read many of Faulks' novels, I was looking forward to reading Human Traces. It started well, but ultimately was a disappointment.Overall, there is something about the characters that is not quite 'real'. Whilst I was interested to know what happened, my interest was never quite full. There seemed to me to be random characters added for no reason other than to fill a few pages. The course of the story moved like a badly edited film, with long and short 'hops' in time that seemed to come at inopportune times in the narrative.Overall, for anyone interested in Faulks' work, I'd recommend Bird Song, Charlotte Gray, or the excellent Engleby before Human Traces."
3,A classic book for introduction,"I always enjoy reading Crown Art Series since I was younger. The reproductions of art work sometimes more radiant than the original work, for this particular artist too. Not much to tell. But I always pick Crown Art Series to start to know the one I didn't know before or just for the sake of reproduction of the artwork it self. Enjoy!!"
5,love the dvd.explains everything clearly.only neg is at end of one of the dvd skipped.,"loved the dvd.everything was explained very clearly,slow,and doesn't lv much out.only neg is end of dvd skips so missed part of hand instruction."
5,Excellent video,This is much easier to learn by watching artist T work. Great way to learn by seeing this gifted artist at work
3,ok product,initially liked it but soon got bored of the taste and some time I do get a yucky taste...
5,Can't find a better price,"The only time I can buy this at a more reasonable price is when I find a coupon for it in a doctor's office. Being able to get it in packs of 6, and being able to buy more than 1 or two packs at a time makes life a little easier on me. Free shipping is such a plus and sometimes this particular flavor is hard to find, but I am able to buy it on Amazon."
5,My Dr recommended it too!,It tastes like a chocolate milkshake to me and my Dr recommended it too! It really is very good AND good for you. Im recovering from throat cancer and Im sure it helps me out.
5,Does the job without question,"I have a 2005 Honda Civic EX coupe and I got this radiator cap to help with troubleshooting a coolant loss issue I was having. Unfortunately for my wallet, it was a blown head gasket as I was suspecting. Without any sort of testing equipment, I could tell the system was more pressurized than the original cap just based on the fact that it blew coolant out of my reservoir, which was overfilled - my fault. It seems to do what it's advertised to do and is more affordable than other ""higher pressure"" caps I saw while comparison shopping."
5,A must-have book for teachers,"The behavioral techniques taught in this book enabled me to set up a token economy in my initially rowdy classroom. After implementing this program my class became known for its good behavior and manners. My class was complimented by the superintendent at their DARE graduation for good behavior. The system requires some effort to set up and much discipline to maintain. However, the rewards of a compliant class ready to learn is worth the work."
4,Great lil' tables,"I like these tables a lot -- they are affordable, easy to put together, and relatively sturdy for how much they cost (I was actually expecting something a tad more shoddy). We are using these for our office lobby and they go well with the brown leather chairs we purchased. The tables took 10 minutes or fewer to put both together, and it is so simple you probably don't need the instructions. Beware that they are pretty short, a little under two feet. This works with the low chairs we have but may be awkward next to a taller seat.All things considered, these are not fancy or anything but are cute and fairly well made. I would recommend these to a friend."
3,"Too Long, I Put It Down",This book was engaging up to a point and then I started skipping pages and then I finally put it down and watched a documentary.There was way too much Ann Rule in this book and I really didn't care about that part. Stick to the narrative.The opening chapter starts with a bang and foreshadows the To Catch a Killer type style that makes true crime so interesting. I just wish she kept things going in that vein.
5,Chilling,"This is my first book by Ann Rule and my first real look at Ted Bundy. I had heard the stories and had watched a documentary about Ted, but nothing could have prepared me for this portrait of the killer. What is so scary for me is that I may have trusted him, may have tried to ""help"" him when he appeared with his arm or leg in a cast. Ann Rule does an excellent job of telling what must be for her, a difficult tale . Even though I found the book deeply disturbing, I think it is very well done. A definite page-turner, as well as an eye opener."
3,The Stranger Beside Me,"Ann Rule did a good job of re-telling the true story of Theodore Robert Bundy. However, she often focused too much on herself and her personal accomplishments rather than on the story of Ted Bundy. Some of the sections where she talked about herself interrupted the flow of the novel. The fact that she actually knew Ted Bundy gave the book a more personal touch. Her in- depth knowledge about Ted Bundy gives the reader the feeling of knowing who he really was. Ann Rule wrote the story of Ted Bundy unbiasly. She leaned neither to his innocence or to him being guilty. This gave the story a more true quality. The overall story of Ted Bundy, told in The Stranger Beside Me, was intriguing and interesting to read. I am looking forward to reading another one of her novels. Ann Rule is really the ""Queen of True Crimes!""."
3,"Competent and readable, but not deep or insightful","Most people seem to speak well of this book. It's not that I didn't like it so much as it didn't satisfy me. There are descriptions of grizzly murders, and Ann Rule has the advantage of personally knowing Ted Bundy, so she's got a better view than most. Nevertheless, I feel like I'm reading a newspaper account. We don't get under the skin of Bundy; we don't know what makes him tick; we know very little of his life. When I finished, I didn't feel I really understood anything."
4,For those of you who haven't had your fill of Serial Killer psychosis,"Here you go. A great tale of someone who worked beside Bundy. This is kind of a trashy genre, but I personally can't help myself. And this does have its insights. I read this in college, so I don't know as I'd call it a literary masterwork, but very readable. The story of how Bundy worked in a crisis center was really chilling. One of the mind-blowing things about Bundy was that his girlfriend was working with the FBI as she suspected he was the culprit, yet she stayed with him for two years afterward. This book is full of weird turns like that; how someone right next to you is a full-blown psychopath. The stuff of nightmares."
5,Truth trumps fiction,"Ann Rule, a true-crime author, is hired to chronicle the hunt for a brutal serial killer. Slowly she comes to realize that the homicidal maniac police are searching for is her beloved friend and co-worker. No one can make real life characters as compelling as Ann Rule, and The Stranger Beside Me is a masterpiece. And what makes later editions worth the trouble of seeking out is the additional material Rule adds, often in answer to readers' questions."
4,Interesting Book,"Great Book. I have read it before but this recent release has more information added, such as women that have come forward reliving their stories to Ann about escaping Ted."
3,The Stranger Beside Me,"Ann Rule did a great job in reporting the true story of Theodore Robert Bundy. However, she often deviated from the story to talk about her personal life. The sections in where she wrote about herself interupted the flow of the novel. I beleive she tried to credit herself too much throughout the book. in some parts of the novel there was too much of a description. Some things could have been written better with fewer words. The overall story of Ted Bundy was awesome. The story itself was intriging and interesting to read. A.Paul"
2,I can not get into this book.,"I do not know what it is about Ann Rule's writing style , but i just can not seem to get caught up in her books. And i really want to read a book on Ted Bundy. I have picked this up more than once trying to get into it but it just seems to drag for me. However i would prefer that to the embellishment so many ""true"" crime writers seem to put into their books. One day i am going to force myself to read this and maybe i will feel differently once i get through the whole book."
2,A great disappointment,"Far too sympathetic a portrayel of Ted Bundy. The book has a wistful what-might-have-been tone to it.Ms. Rule claims that Bundy walked on his own two feet to his execution. A report from the prison, perhaps published after Ms. Rule's book, said that his legs collapsed and he was carried to his death. It would be nice to know he felt even a fraction of the fear he gave his victims."
2,Bad Book,Book is unbeliveable...no one would feel that way about a killer!! Even after she found out he was a killer she still was defending him!!
5,TERRIFIC!!,"Ann Rule not only gives an insider look into the mind of Ted Bundy, but she has also shown the two sides of him, one a monster and the other a caring friend. The best book I've read of Ann Rule."
5,Gripping and chilling,"By far, the best book written about this mad man. Why? Because the author got to know the man behind the beast and tell his story as if we had known him. Ann Rule's account of the gripping murders brings to light how very close each one of us is to the horror and frightening reality of this world. This book never left me through the five or six times I have read it through...and it still sends chills up and down my spine. A must read for any true crime fan."
