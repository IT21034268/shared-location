1,Petmate Ultra Bubbler,This product has a nice soothing sound as the water bubbles other than that there is nothing good about it. This product has leaked water all over my floor at least 3 times for no apparent reason so it does me no good. It is currently stored on a shelf with a bunch of other stuff I am going to get rid up. A waste of money!
3,Wish it would have worked!,"BOTH of my cats love to drink from the faucet. I'd purchased another item from petmate that worked well but my cats didn't drink from so I thought I'd try this one rather than a drinkwell because of price. Sadly, it isn't working. Initially my younger cat liked to watch the bubbles and play in the water but that lasted two days. My older cat didn't look twice at the bubbler.As far as fountains go, I rate this a three because it looks nice (is a little bulky), holds plenty of water, and is NOT noisy. I found it to produce a rather pleasant sound. But it doesn't get my cats to drink any water. I honestly haven't seen my older cat drink from it at all! And my younger cat has made puddles around it and drank a couple times but again, that was the first few days only.I'm going to try a drinkwell."
1,NOISY!,"I would love to know how other people who have indicated this unit is not noisy are using it. It is EXTREMELY noisy, regardless of how I'm holding it or how the pump is positioned. I am definitely returning it. Very disappointed."
4,petmate waterer,"Product works well. Had a little trouble getting our cat used to the bubbles in the water, but now she drinks out of it fine and sometimes attempts to ""bite"" the bubbles."
3,Upside down bubbler,"This product works as stated, however, wouldn't it be nice if they could make a bubbler that you didn't have to take apart to fill up with water. Why can't you have the TOP removable instead of the bottom so you can just take off the top and add water. Too easy? Guess so!"
1,Waterbowl leaked due to hole in base unit,The base unit had a small hole in it and it leaks large puddles of water. I took it out of the box and started to set it up and saw puddles and puddles of water so I am packing it up and sending it back to Amazon.
1,copy of mistaken-laden OCR,"Be forewarned! Although there is nothing wrong with the printing and paper quality of this text, it is a reproduction of a poorly scanned OCR with innumerable bits of random characters, and footnotes strewn throughout the text without warning. If they had used the original from which it was scanned, it might have been a nice book. As it is, you can't really read it without consulting another copy of the text..."
5,Mucho Bass!,"I have bough cheap Sony and Pioneer amps at big box stores that said 600 or 1000 watts only to sound like 50-100 watts, so I was not expecting this to be very loud. It's only mounted to a 10"" mtx sub that's about 8 years old and has been in 5 different cars and even mounted in my room behind my couch for a while. They just don't make them like they used to, or so I thought, this amp blew me away!At 150 watts, because I am only using one channel, it shook my poor Nissan Altima to pieces. It was so incredibly deep and loud I was very impressed. As always your results may vary depending on type of wiring, deck, input source and sub layout. But I do not think anyone will be disappointed with this amp. It's great, loud, runs cooler than most, and is at a great price."
1,MUCH Better books available,"Most other books on CSS talk about styling tables. I found this book (for a newbie with CSS) pointless and confusing. Don't bother with it. Other books by O'Reilly can teach one enough about theory to make this book superfluous at best. IF you do not understand CSS at all, this book is not really for you. Walk before you run. This book is for folks with a better understanding than I have."
3,I had my hopes too high...,"I really wanted to learn about CSS, besides from changing fonts in dreamweaver. I read the whole book, hoping to find some good lessons or examples, the book has examples but it just showed ""the holy grail"" of the three-columned layout, and other examples that that wasn't enough for me to grasp. I still have questions lingering on my mind. The rest of the book has a long Appendix, that takes up the reminder with some pages of resources. I still have mixed feelings about the book, I know I can probably use it when I have solid grasp on this CSS. The title to me was misleading, and I wish the book could focus on the trends that developers use in their css design, plus give lessons that goes step by step and break it down for you. I guess I was hoping for a hands-on ----> but I guess I have keep looking and stick to tables for now..."
2,HTML Utopia: Designing Without Tables Using CSS,"In my opinion the book was lame. It was apparently written by an author with limited web experience particularly for large scale web sites. The theory of the book is okay, but the details of how to pull this off in a large web site are not discussed. The book is called Designing Without Tables, however nearly 1/3 of the book is dedicated to designing with tables. Might be good for a college student, but not in the real world of Google, Amazon, Yahoo etc."
3,Good but not enough,"I bought this book in order to learn rules and develop markup and I got some of that, but most of the explanations were given in terms of a practical example. This made it unnecessarily difficult to visualize how the specific book example translated to other cases. A more theoretical book with a more general perspective does the job better."
1,Save your money and time,"Hate to be so critical, but this book is very irritating. The pretense of the book is the great ability to ""stylize"" your HTML web pages with CSS. So, either through ignorance or some financial decision, the book is published completely in black and white. That's right gang, A $40 book extolling the wonders of using colors and design that maybe has 10 B&W photos of a screen shot. About 470 pages of sleeping pill rea..din....."
1,Disappointing,"I have frequented the sitepoint website on several occassions. It is basically a website purporting to be a source of information for designers while really being nothing more than a hype machine to sell their publications.This book is much like the website of sitepoint. Much hype with little substance. While there is some filler in this book that might be helpful to the CSS neophyte, it is certainly not a book with a singular focus on designing table-less websites using CSS.I'm afraid this book will do little more than lighten your wallet and lessen the available space on your bookshelf for books of more substance."
4,easy to read,This book is easy to read. I am using it pretty much as a reference book. I do wish it would have been a bit bigger of a book with more indepth examples but thats why they have website.
2,Misleading Title,"I think this book is a wonderful overview of CSS1 and some coverage of CSS-P (Positioning). Given the title, I was led to believe that there would extensive coverage on how to take table design into a design without tables through use of CSS-P. However this was not the case, and as such I was sorely disappointed. I think a more representative title would be ""Designing with CSS"". I could go into details, but I think you get the point.Another thing to note about the book was the excessive price in contrast to the quality of the printed pages itself. The book looks as if it was xeroxed at Kinkos or a copy/print shop near you."
5,Hidden treasure,"What a great book! My two year old son has picked this as a bedtime book for going on 19 straight days since it was given to us, and I don't actually even mind (yet). It is great fun to look for the little boy in the book, and it so beautifully gets the imagination going. Nicely detailed pictures make it a challenge (the first few times) to find the little boy and leave lots to look at even after the mystery of 'finding' him has been solved."
3,Kept my interest but lacks plausibility and depth,"Danny Cray, struggling twenty-something artist, seems to turn into a cross between Austin Powers and Jason Bourne overnight as he strives to save the world from a Billionaire techno-savvy far-reaching sociopath who we suddenly learn is broke.The story touches on many topics without ever delving into them long enough to create real interest. The author touches on nano-technology, art, turkish/kurdish culture & religion, and somehow the Billionaire knows how to basically steal a person's voice and image and generate a techno-clone. All in all it was just too much flamboyance.However, the story moves along from one event to another at a fast pace and is entertaining."
2,Implausible,"Danny Cray (the hero of this piece) has to be the dumbest hero to stumble off the pages of fiction, and he manages to save the world in the last 30 pages of the book.Anyone with half a brain (Danny Cray obviously is not in this demographic) would have figured out he was being set up. It is painful to watch him move from one disaster to the next - still managing to out smart the bad guys.This starving artist continues to find people who speak English and seems to have enough money.This is certainly not up to Mr. Case's previous efforts."
3,Predictable,"I liked the Gensis Code also by Case but found this to be all too similar to every other ""thriller"". Struggling artist takes a strange case for a good amount of money and gets into more trouble then he bargained for. I liked the main character and I wanted him to be safe - I was a bit confused on what the nanotechnology had to do with this sect and the sabatoged statue."
2,"I kept turning the pages, but was ultimately disappointed","I am a John Case fan - and I had high hopes for this novel. I enjoy novels that take the reader to different geographical places, and that is one of the big things that kept me turning the pages.Unfortunately, a disappointing ending and a main character that kept doing things that would have me close to pulling out my hair force me to not recommend this book to my friends."
1,Very Disappointing,"The Genesis Code and The Syndrome were excellent thrillers by ""John Case"".....but this was easily one of the weakest reads I've had in a long time. Without getting wordy, the biggest drawback of this book is the main character...he was weak, moronic and uninteresting...and having to follow him for 400 pages was way too much to ask. I'll chalk this up as a bad game and hope ""Case"" gets back on track his next time out."
3,good and imaginative storytelling but...,"I found ""The Eigth Day"", to be a good, gripping, imaginative, and fun read. The story is sort of 'Chrightonesque' in its techno-thriller nature, and is fast paced and gripping. The main character is well developed, if a tiny bit fat fetched (but then again, it's fiction innit?) and the storys settings are colourful and varied.That's all good. Sadly it's not all that good. The story, gripping as it might be, is a bit on the unbelieveable side and at points stretches your good-will to the max. At times it becomes quite predictable, especially if you've read other John Case books before. They seem to follow a pattern. It has a hard time convincing you, that this could actually happen (even when you're in thriller reading mode), which is not the best thing for a novel.Still, the storytelling is good and it's an exciting story. Definitely worth a read."
2,Uneven storytelling,"John Case, the pseudonym of a husband and wife writing team, has written a pseudo-thriller that not only meanders in its narrative, but manages to insult the reader's intelligence as well. If I had actually purchased this book instead of finding it on the shelf at my local library, I would've been angry at having wasted the cover price on ""The Eighth Day.""While the premise is excellent--nanotechnology as global takeover--it's mired in repetitive and uneven storytelling. The ending is so contrived and ridiculous, I wondered if perhaps the authors had watched one too many Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis movies. It wasn't a total waste of time, though, as I found myself drawn deeper and deeper into it, despite the sloppy and amateurish writing. With better editing and some severe tightening up, ""The Eighth Day"" might've been a really good story. As it is, I would recommend reading their first novel instead, or something else altogether."
2,A disappointment,"I'm a John Case fan and this one was a real disappointment. I liked the Genesis Code so much I read it twice, and the others were very readable too, but this one just became way too unbelievable to be enjoyed. The story was contrived and the main character a little too stupid. Sorry - this one made me think twice about running out to get the next one."
1,where was the editor???,"on page 9, a murder victim's birthdate is given as 6/11/53.on page 37, this same victim is described as being in his late 30's.for this to be true, the book would need to be set between 1988 and 1993!! unfortunately, we know this is NOT the case, because on page 35, this same victim is said to have published a book ""during the last decade,"" in 1995.i absolutely can't stand this kind of sloppiness, especially early in a novel. i immediately put it down for good, despite having loved all of case's previous works."
1,Not the best,"I will admit that John Case's books are a bit of a guilty pleasure. While I'm sure even the author(s) wouldn't argue them as life-altering literature, they are fairly well written and original novels within a genre (thrillers) that by and large seems to have run out of steam. That being said, I can only hope that pressing bills and/or a pressing publication deadline was the cause for the massively bad ""Eighth Day"". While I could wax on about this or that particular problem, the overall fault in this book is what can only be termed a terribly weak premise and a plot that just fails to engage on every level. Plot points make no sense, the writing is stilted and formulaic and so on. Do yourself a favour...if you want a good little ""escapist"" read by John Case pick up ""Genesis Code"" or ""The First Horseman"". Otherwise if you persist with the ""Eighth Day"", don't say say you weren't warned when, barely managing to digest the horribly cheesy ending, you wonder how to get your money back."
2,complete disappointment...,"I LOVED Genesis Code and recommend it all the time. I asked for this book for Christmas.However, I wish I had asked Santa (or Mr. Case) for something different.The nanotech ""hook"" is just that. The plot of this book has nothing to do with nano. If you want a nano-thriller, read ""Prey"" by Michael Crichton. Here, it was an afterthought. When it first crept into the story I eagerly anticipated the tie-in later on. It never happened. Forget the attempt to reel in nano-interested readers.I felt like I had gone on the ""around the world"" adventure with the protagonist, reluctantly. I hung on to the edge of this hopeful joyride, only to be shoved out of the plane after a somewhat abrupt landing, with not so much as a ""thank you, come again"" from the airstaff.All kidding aside, I will not recommend this book nor did I enjoy it."
3,GOOD ENTERTAINING BUT NOT REALLY SMART,"Dan Cray gets himself into trouble, the problem is we see it comming much before him.In Case's novel, Cray becomes (a la Ludlum) an international target. He is involved (a la Dan Brown) in what could be a religious conspiracy. The scientific mystery behind the plot is (a la Crichton) in nanotechnology.The novel, so, can be said to remind any of those authors. Only it doesn't, Ludlum persecusions are smarter, Crichton's scientific plots really have to do with the book's story).The Eight Day has a smart prose (much better than the overpraised Brown), nice descriptions and some good moments, but it is full of deux es machina solutions (that credit card near the ending, that simpatetic truck driver) and predictable turns (the blackmail, the torture, even the uzi).Nevertheless it is an entertaining read, just don't ask for more."
3,Average Effort from Case,"I'm an avid reader of Case's novels and have read all of them. I've even gotten my wife interested in them. They are all great page-turners that all seem to combine a bit of history and religion into good to great thrillers. However, this book didn't measure up to my favorites (Syndrome and Genesis Code) for a couple of reasons. First, while most of Case's heroes have a feasible background for getting involved in the typical intrigue, the lead character in this is a washed up, layabout artist who has trouble making up his mind whether or not to get married. After that introduction, it's hard to believe him as a character who is smart and, more importantly, driven enough to keep himself alive and a step ahead of the bad guys. Secondly, while I definitely didn't figure the ""MacGuffin"" out, this has to be one of the most far-fetched, twisted plots these Case has come up with."
3,"Some parts great, some parts very, very weak","I loved the first two John Case novels I read ('The Genesis Code' and 'The First Horseman') but this one joins 'The Syndrome' as a disappointment.It's not that the book isn't readable, or at times outright exciting, especially the parts in Turkey. No, the problem lies in the main character - the artist/part-time investigator. As an artist he's an outright ditz. As an investigator he's just a step below James Bond. I had no sense that he really was the same guy. How did this artist get this part time investigator's job? It just felt like a contrived fit the whole time.In addition, the evil villain's evil plot seemed like an awful lot of work - perhaps more than it was worth. Plus, his evil plan wasn't particularly evil, more like it was misguided - and definitely not worth killing a lot of people over."
3,Not very believable adventures of an amateur P.I.,"Danny, an artist who takes on free-lance investigative jobs in his spare time, is one of the least convincing private investigators in current thrillers. As described by Case, he seems naive, reckless, and clumsy. Hired by a man posing as a wealthy lawyer, Danny stumbles into a plot involving a mysterious religious sect. His adventures take him to Europe and to the wilds of eastern Turkey. He survives potentially fatal situations mostly by dumb luck. His carelessness gets a helpful priest killed. The people around him seem not to notice when he shows up bleeding or soaked with dirty water. Despite losing his belongings, he always has access to money. In the real world, Danny would have been arrested if not killed. Skip this one."
3,readable but ...,"With some of the enticing titbits I thought at first this could have gone the way of The Ninth Gate but there was no supernatural content whatsovever. Not that this is the problem. The various elements that weave the plot are quite gripping. This book is brimming with ideas (for plots), but sadly, upon reflection one is left with the feeling that these ideas are unfinished and have not been properly developed and matured to allow their full potential. Nevertheless some of the narratives, particularly those concerning the protagonist's travels are most enjoyable. The book could have been much, much better had the storyline been allowed maturity where it was required. There is enough material for two, perhaps three novels here."
1,it was horrible,this had to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. I suggest you take it off the shelves and never sell it to the public. I never see how this movie was even released. Straight to the point.. it was horrible and a waste of money.
3,good movie,"Ninja Terminator is a good movie, but Harry has the uglyest ninja costume I have ever seen, and I think any one of us can go and chop up a watermelon. The fight seens were great, but Jaguar Wong( Harry's henceman) had more fight seens then the star himself. Not to mention the master ninja had the most dumbest, unnessicary laugh I have ever heard. The last time I watched this movie I was barely 4, but know that I got to see it again, i give it a 3 out of 5."
5,A must see for Ninja Fans,My son is a huge fan of Richard Harrison. He has this movie Ninja Terminator on VHS tape and it began playing badly. I found this movie on DVD. The order came quickly and in excellent condition I will order from this company again. Thank you !
2,Exellent Martial Arts Moves,This video is overall okay! But...the theme of this movie is boring. I dont recomend someone 100% sure to buy this video...but i would!
1,Fake display of ninja's.,"I rented this video to see Sho Kosugi, unfortunately he is not in the movie at all, he host it and they show him for two minutes. This is the worst martial arts film I have ever seen. It is about all these ninja's fighting to gain control of a special statue that was stolen. The statue is suppost to make any man who poseses it invincible. I story is rediculus, and the fight scenes are so fake with ninja flying through the air and dissapearing in a second. If your wanting to see Sho Kosugi or just ninja action go rent ""Revenge Of the Ninja"", don't rent this it is not worth it and was a total waste of my time to watch it."
3,Interesting but could be better,There are so many really wonderful documentaries out that and this one is not going to be getting a lot of great reviews I am sure. It is not bad but could have been much better. I enjoyed it and did learn a bit from it but I think it suffered by not having enough production value even though having some great subject matter. It was worth the money as it was not expensive so I am not disappointed.
2,DVD watcher,"I was rather disappointed...it wasn't quite what I expected. And for being Blue-Ray, the color wasn't as outstanding as my other Blue-Rays (it looked the same as any other DVD), and there were no subtitles."
5,nice info and photography!,The narrators are appropriate and interesting! The photography is very nice!National Parks are much more interesting than the National Monuments!
2,Not so great.,"If you're expecting a national geographic quality documentary on national parks, this isn't it. The whole thing looked very amateur and was really quite boring."
5,Under that mermaid angel at the dance,"I read this book when I was twelve. It is still my favorite book. And when I read it, I finished it in 2 days! I couldn't put the book down. It is not tons of adventure on every page but it is soo interesting. I felt connected to Jesse. Well, Jesse feels kinda in a rut in a very boring town (Ida). But when roxanne moves in she changes Jesses life. They become best friends even though the big age difference. I think the climax of the book was when Roxanne wanted to touch Frankenstiens hand at the church and she didn't. I thought it was so sad that she sat next to him but never said or did anything. And he never knew. And that she came all the way to Ida and sat next to him and never told him. Very sad. At the end of the book. I wished that it would go on. I wish Martha Moore would make a sequel. Because I want to know if Frankenstien ever found out about his mother."
2,Disappointing,"Received this as a gift. Definitely overpriced and lacked substance. The previous review was right on, and it's definitely not for someone who likes coffee a lot."
1,NOT for Coffee Lovers!!!,"This gift basket contains INSTANT coffee. The tin of instant coffee is enough for one cup. It's marketed towards Coffee Lovers, but your true coffee afficianados are not going to enjoy this as a gift. If you are trying to find a gift for a coffee lover, unless their idea of good coffee is one, single serving of nestle international foods instant coffee, look for a better quality of coffee at a place like Peet's."
2,Not worth the $$,"I got this for my coffee-loving mother for Christmas last year. The packaging and the coffee cups are great - those impressed me. The amount of actual coffee you get is incredibly disappointing. There is only enough to make a few cups - I know my mom drinks more than that in one day! Anyways, not worth buying unless you really want the cups and basket that it comes in."
3,"Good idea, not enough story...","I'd just finished 'The Big Nowhere' and was looking for another Ellroy novel. I did like the general idea and plot for this book, but I ended up skipping over the constant news clippings/police reports. After the killer is found out by the cop in Wisconsin, I almost lost interest. It became too strange. Anyway it wasn't a long book, so its worth a peak."
1,Trash,"A purported attempt to examine the psychology of the mass murder in novel form, what this book is really about is hopefully (from the author's perspective)movie rights.Dostoyevsky this ain't.Don't bother."
3,Badly written but still stimulating,"While the writing sometimes made me wince (especially in its character development and over-use of words such as 'preternaturally') this book is hard to dismiss completely. While it didn't keep me awake at night the way ""American Psycho"" did, it still desreves credit for its attempt to take on a subject that has challenged psychologists and socioligists alike."
2,Silent Terror,"Pornographic but artistic, with due respect to Ellroy. Beware before you read about fantasy-based serial killing."
3,Paperback?,"I think it should be clearer if a book is a paperback or hardcovered. In this case I assumed, wrongly, it was hardcovered."
3,A good idea that doesn't fully work.,"The book I think is a nice idea, but somehow I feel that since the main character lacks 'normal' feelings then it is wrong to see the story through his eyes. The places where he has to escape could have been made exiting by actually describing the chase, but instead it gets a line or two. The first part of the book is good, telling about his childhood, but from then on it is too much of the same, and in particular all the news clippings seem a tad too much - to stack them together. Certainly one gets an insight into a serial killers insane mind, but there isn't enough developed characters in the book - the only being Martin Plunkett, and also it seems too long eventhough it really isn't page-wise, which perhaps only show that it lacks a storyline. As such though then the book is good, and worth a read."
1,Disgusting,"Typically I enjoy James Ellroy. I have read several of his novels and two volumes of short stories (and essays). I was introduced to his work through The Blue Dahlia which I found so absorbing, I read it in one day. Therefore, I approached this volume with anticipation, knowing it would also be dark, thickly plotted, and possibly disturbing. While Ellroy isn't someone I'd care to read everyday, I do enjoy the time I have spent exploring the underbelly of 1950s LA. Until I read (or tried to read) Killer on the Road. This book is a disgusting exploration into the mind of a serial killer. I felt no empathy toward the protagonist and just kept asking myself why I was reading this and what was the point. I got through 90 pages and finally threw the book away--the first book I left unfinished since A Tale of Two Cities in high school nearly thirty years ago. (And I have probably averaged reading two books a week since that time.) My short, one word synopsis for this work: ugly."
1,Not good - but possibly worth it for perspective on Ellroy,"Probably only worthwhile to offer readers perspective on one of America's greatest living writers, currently at the height of his powers (can he possibly get better?).Too long, repetitious, with unnecessary slaughter/clutter, silly at times and without surprise. If you're just getting into Ellroy, maybe - but only so you can later discern the massive heights this guy scales in AT and TC6000. But if you're looking around for the rest of the catalogue and found this re-badged re-issue, don't bother, IMO."
2,Average book but poor by Ellroy standards,"Out of the 4 Ellroy books I have read, this one was by far the worst out of the group. It profiles a serial killer and is writeen as his autobiography. While it sounds like it could be an interesting story, it in fact is rather dull in many parts of the story. Supposedly the killer is very smart, but he doesn't come across as that way; instead he seems of average intelligence. Basically what seperates him from the common criminal is he isn't a complete idiot. Furthermore, he was a boring person. Sure, there was the occasional murder but other than that he just drives around the country. I strongly recommend saving your time and reading a different book by Ellroy; I'm pretty sure whichever one you choose instead will be more entertaining than this one."
5,"Animorphs, 33 Review","This book is about how the Animorphs try to destroy an evil device.Tobias has to acquire A's DNA.The bad thing is, the yeerks thought Tobias was an andelite.They try to make him demorph.There are many main characters, Ax, Rachel, Tobias, Jake, Cassie and Marco.They each have special things about each of the Animorphs. Cassie can morph the fastest.The conflict or problem for the main characters are the yeerks try to take control of the world.They have a device to try to make andelites and humans demorph.This would allow the Animorphs' secrets to be given up. How they resolved their conflict is that when Tobias got captured, his friends saved him.Then they completed the mission and left. That is how they solved the conflict.I would recommend this book to others. This is a good book to read.I didn't want to stop reading."
5,Tobias's Death Clock is now his KISS clock!,"Ooohh boy! After a long time of waiting, it has occurred! Bird-boy gets his special smoochie from Rachel! C'mon, I want more of it! Yeah! When Tobias is the storyteller, I need more K-I-S-S-I-N-G between him and Rachel. Yeeee! When I read that part, part of me wanted to throw up; my other side was glad to finally get what I'd been expecting. More mushy stuff, please!"
2,Animorphs #33: The Illusion,"In this story the Yeerks have built an Anti-Morphing-Ray(AMR)and want to test it on one of the Animorphs. Tobias decides tomorph Ax and let himself be captured by the Yeerks. The plan was tolet the Yeerks zap him with the ray. If the AMR worked, Tobias would morph back to hawk and the Yeerks would think that the ray was a failure. If the AMR didn't work, it wouldn't matter. What Tobias didn't plan for was that the Yeerk in charge (Taylor) would want to torture him to death."
4,"Good, but not great","I loved the story, but it was not at all up to K.A. Applegate's usual standard. It was frankly dissapointing.First of all, Tobias is not really himself. He just dosen't seem like the usual Tobias. Maybe that's just because this is the first book I read from Tobias's point of view. Maybe not.Second, the ending of the story is really much different than the normal. In fact, I thought it was worse. It seems that no one but Tobias plays any key role in the story.I say: If you want to read a REALLY good book, look elsewhere. But if you have a few hours to waste, go for it. I suggest not buying it, but checking it out from a library to see if you really like it."
5,Great addition I wished I would have bought right w/product.,"When I bought my new Karcher pressure washer, I was not sure if I needed an extension pressure hose. Well, I figured pretty quick when using the pressure washer in real life, that it was not fun at all when washing the sidewalks around the house, that I had to pull an electric extension cord and a regular water hose around the house with the pressure washer. For washing the car only, the standard pressure hose works fine as long as park the pressure washer close to the car. But for serious work around the house, the high pressure extension hose is a must and a great addition worth well the money spent for much less hassle."
2,"not a horrible idea, but clumsily executed and badly written","I almost stopped reading after the first few pages. The writing was painful to slog through. The plot turned out to be mildly amusing, but the characters were shallow, and it read like junior-high fiction... as in, written by an 8th grader. Nowhere near the style or panache of Anita Blake, or Betsy, or even Sookie's friends. I will not be reading the next one in the series, and I thank God that i only paid 50 cents for it."
2,Blah,"It all seemed a bit cliche' to me. Like I could have turned to any late night cable network on tv and found the same dribble. I bought the book because it had promise. A team of vampires to take down terrorist has promise, but it ended up with sugar coated plastic dolls fluffing their way through what should have been serious problems. The really bad part was the fact that all the characters really cared about was getting laid. I mean really, the sillyness of rubbing her foot up and down the attractive man's calf is old, overdone, and overripe (i.e. it stinks)"
2,Great potential but no follow-through,"This book makes one of the classic mistakes - instead of showing the reader about the characters through their actions, the author tells the reader. That was one of the distracting things about this book - the dialogue didn't match the actions. So, we have a genius vampire heroine who spends more time thinking about what she's going to wear to a meeting than what's going on in the mission to which she's been assigned. She's an ex-ninja that never does a single martial arts move. Instead, she continually resorts to brute strength. I, like a previous reviewer, was frustrated with her interaction with her love interest. She keeps telling him she has to be equal in the relationship but she never acts like one - again telling instead of showing. She jeopardizes her own mission in order to help out his, not even knowing what his goal was.On the plus side, it is an interesting concept and does show promise...if the heroine ever starts using that genius IQ."
3,An OK Read...,"...I enjoyed this book, but I am not going to put it on my keeper shelf. I am going to buy the next book, ut I plan to buy it used. The story, to me was only, OK>not great."
3,Beyond the Pale,Beyond the Pale was not what I anticipated however it was an exciting and good read.
1,I regret reading it,"As a knowledgeable reader of Anne Rice and Laurell K. Hamilton and others similar, I was so dissapointed in this book that I regret even finishing it, and that's not something I say often. The plot is very thin and predictable, the characters shallow, and it's so obvious that the author has more experience writing tear-jerking romance novels than action ones. She's using modern themes like terrorism to make it more interesting, but appears to know about it as much as a 12-year old who watched half a season of Alias. And as a beginner in the genre, she should know better than to dare use a prestigious character, Louis from Interview with a Vampire, then make a mockery of him, call him a ""creep"", and let him die with no honor. And we got it that she *likes* Brad Pitt and Dario looks like him, she doesn't have to mention it 5 times."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","This would've been a fine young-young adult book without all the graphic sex. Or it would've been a fine Anita Blake clone without the naive plot lines and inane conversation. What it mostly reminded me was Buffy the vampire slayer but without the humor. So it has many withouts and only one with. A very nice idea, cut down by the author in too many ways to count. How on earth she got the contract for the series, I will never know.I'll leave you with this gem: The author writes that Dubrovnik is described as Venice of the Adriatic, but older. Well. Not even mentioning that here are no similarities between these towns whatsoever (other than their age and centuries-long rivalry), they are BOTH in the Adriatic! Someone up there must love Savannah..."
1,Corny and Phony and a bunch of Phooey,"Reading the back cover, I thought this might be good and I am always looking for a new series. As I was reading, I couldn't believe my eyes. This has got to be hands down the worst book I've read. The characters were cliche and predictable. I've read mushy love stories that have more substance than this love lorn vamp with all her sidekicks. I can't beleive this is going to have a sequel."
2,"Readable, but underwhealming","As a guy, I got the book because it was about spies and vampires, not because it was a romance. The romance was pretty hokey. Lots of graphic sex -- these books are targetted to women right? Don't complain to me anymore about guys and porn...The author has her own unique vampire lore, with vampires having reflections, but still vulnerable to stakes and crosses. Vampires can have kids, and when they do, the kids are human. Vampires turn into giant bats, something more like a demon or gargoyle in my mind. She tosses in a crossover of Louis from Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.It was readable, but pretty weak in my mind. Maybe this is the general quality of a romance novel tho."
1,WARNING......,"This book is written in 1st person. As I absolutely detest 1st person books I wanted to warn others who feel the same way so that they do not waste their money. I do wish that the publishers, book clubs and reviewers would mention the fact that books are written in 1st person in their story blurbs so that those of us who dislike them won't waste their time and money on them."
1,Poorly written,This book was poorly written with lots of descriptions and lacking anything that would get me to care for the characters. There were multiply flaws in the plot with the biggest one the inability of the vampire heroine to recognize a fellow vampire.
2,"Interesting,","But as time goes on the sheer stupidity and ineptness of the ""hero"" becomes irritating rather then appealing."
4,IT'S THE MUSIC ...FORGET THE PLOT,"The movie provides an extremely rare opportunity to hear Gigli in the final scene from ""Otello""..surprisingly moving without the ""emoting"" that often interferes with its tragic power..and Gigli's voice is supreme throughout the film..The overall plot of the film, however, leaves a very bad after-taste..Through no fault of her own, Emma Grmmatica, a legendary Italian actress comes across as the mother from Hell..protecting her son (Gigli) in a plot development that could generously be described as contrived.."
4,Pretty but a little pricey,"I have been wanting to try MACs LipGlass for a while now. I finally broke down and bought this one.. Underage is a nice color. More of a ""peachy nude"" on me than a pink which was fine by me! I am giving this a four for a couple of reasons.Although I did like this and will continue to use it until it is gone, I don't think I will purchase it again. Definitely not going on my list of ""can't live without"" items.1) It is pretty sticky - I am more of a fan of ""matte"" type finishes, I guess. But even that isn't bothersome (unless you end up in a windstorm and have long hair like me. Then prepare for a task comparable to a surgical operation to separate the hair from the gloss).2) Price - I think that almost 22 (with shipping) is way too much for this. Again - it was nice.. But not 22 dollars nice."
5,The characters were great,"This is my first book by Ms. Garlock, but it won't be my last. She made you feel as if you were living in that time with those people. I can't want to read With Song."
5,Always excellent pop!,"I believe Tiger Teeth EP was recorded before ""Winds Take No Shape"". Tiger Teeth is much closer to the first album in that the bass lines are way out in front and grooving like a mother! Tiger Teeth also differs in that Simone Rubi sings a couple of the tunes which is always great. I don't know why she does not sing more lead. Just to have ""connection"" is well worth the asking price.Don't take the bus today, get this awesome little collection of great pop tunes instead."
3,"""You're nice enough, Tiger Teeth""","Bubblegummy, but, at least in restrospect, we can see the darker territory stretching out in front of them, that they would move into with Winds Take No Shape, especially on something like ""Curves in a Straight Line."" But some of this is surely hindsight, and this album pops pretty purely. I like the whole thing, but ""Conenection"" and ""Curves"" are disposible, ""Nervous Wreck"" vital, and ""Little Noises"" is catchy as; you may find yourself mouthing to yourself the line ""little noises make me freak out."" Indeed."
2,Get the whole series for the same price,"Sure, you can pay ten dollars and get this set of He-Man episodes...OR you can buy the entire series, which includes all of the episodes included here, for virtually the same price, but with tons more stuff. This set is nothing more than a cheap cash grab. It's one of the very best cartoon series ever made, and the episode arc with the Snake Men is utterly jaw-dropping (figuratively and literally!). BUT...you won't get that stuff on this ""cash grab"" set...so buy the whole series, which is available right here on Amazon for the same price. Have I beat that point into the ground yet? Well, it's only because I don't want you getting ripped off."
5,sound great,"these speakers sound excellent and were easy to instal. the installation instructions were a little bit confusing, but i was able to figure them out and successfully mounted them on our back deck where they work well."
4,Great outdoor speaker,This was a staight replacement for an old pair that had lasted over 8 years outside in the Florida climate. The grill went rusty after 7 years but the case was still looking perfect.Sound quality is excellent without being too hard on your wallet. I will be buying another pair of these when the climate gets to this pair in another 8 years.
4,Initial review,"Very happy with the quality of the sound. Great sound for a good price. As far as durability, too soon to tell."
4,JBL Northridge Bookshelf Speakers,They sound good but not like REAL JBL's.They are good for the Money and look pretty good too as I am using them inside for a small home theater system.They are more of an off-white as compared to a bright white.Mounting brackets worked out well and seem pretty sturdy.The speakers themselves seem pretty well constructed too considering the cost.Recommended but dont expect too much.
4,This review is by Hannah(Chelsea&Yasmin),"Kennedy is actually Barbie(with a new name). This collection is actually supposed to be called Unfurgettable. Anyway, this doll comes with a shiny blue jacket, a shirt with an owl that reads ""My scene cutie 1985"" a fluffy blue lounge chair and cute accessories. I don't think this is the best collection, but overall is really cool! By the way, check out my site at matmice.com/home/amazon_princesses L8er!"
1,Amazon Error,"This is an error on Amazon. They used to have a feedback button for errors, but apparently that's gone.Anyway, the author has not even finished writing this book yet, so it's obviously never been published.We all hope Bill will finish this year (2009). Many of us have been waiting over a decade, but you can't rush a good book!"
3,Cheating His Fans?,"Baldwin does generally write fast paced, suspend the disbelief adventures combining derring-do with beautiful women and, above all, lots of military style action.However, I found ""The Turning Tide"" to contain lots of filler material and minimal action, and, frankly, at three quarters of the way through it becomes extremely weird.Worst, because of the filler stuff, it barely makes progress developing the progress in the war.I feel that Baldwin has cheated us and demand that the follow-on book gets back to the main story line."
5,Great space opera with fun twists,"Bill has done it again! While I do not pretend that the Helmsman series are great literature, they are enjoyable reading and fun adventure.I only hope that Bill does not wait another 15 years for the next book! There is so much to be resolved, I can see good Wilf Brim reading for at least a few more."
4,This book was full of suspense and kept me interested.,"I was impressed with Lawrence Sander's tale ""McNally's Risk"". I found it to be a very fun, easy book to read. The story flowed throughout keeping my curiousity at its peak. I couldn't put it down until I finished it - which only took one day! I am looking forward to reading the other books in this series. I recommend this highly as fun, leisurely reading."
2,Worst Wanderer Fantasy EVER?,"I can't believe the positive reviews this recording has gotten. Don't believe the hype folks; Lang Lang may have technique to burn, but most 1st-year conservatory students possess at least the same interpretive depth, if not more. When he isn't indulging himself in interpretive excess, then Lang Lang is playing as if he really doesn't care much at all.His Schubert is garbage. Let him stick to playing Chinese compositions unknown to Western audiences, because virtually none of us will have any way of drawing comparisons between his interpretation and that of others. I can only assume that his interpretation of Dun Tan is the definitive version --- but I doubt it."
4,"Good reading material, grabs your attention","Great book about international terrorism, apocalypse, and numerology. It starts off with the vice-president being assassinated during the 1998 Sugar Bowl. The bad guys are later found blown up in their getaway boat. The FBI and the Secret Service get involved and the book really takes off from there. It's a great book that keeps you interested. I really enjoyed it."
1,Not what the picture says it is,"I bought these because the picture shows a box that is NOT those crappy Ecstasy condoms/Sensations condoms where they felt a need to balloon the tip so you feel like you're using a garbage bag. So yeah, I got the garbage bag condoms instead. So they lied. Don't order these if you don't want garbage bag condoms."
3,Lazy dub,"Although this album doesn't quite reach the high standards of Pablo's best work, it's by no means as poor as is often made out and generally manages to get into my summer playlist at some point.Recorded at Harry J's and King Tubby's studios in the mid-1970's and mixed by Tubby, it's a lugubrious journey through a selection of mostly familiar rhythms (including versions of Jacob Miller's ""Forward Jah Jah children"", Bob Marley's ""Rebel music"" and the Lee Perry classic ""Curly locks""), featuring typically sparse arrangements and fx. Pablo does seem to be functioning largely on autopilot throughout the proceedings but it's still a perfect album for chilling out to.However if you're new to Pablo I'd recommend that you obtain some of his better work on albums like ""Original rockers"" and ""Who say Jah no dread"" before considering this one...."
2,This book is not what the title suggests.,"This book is full of foreign recipes sized for groups of 6, 12, 20, and 50. There are recipes from all over the world which is pretty impressive and could be very useful for certain types of groups you might be serving. However, it is not at all what I needed when I ordered it, and the title is misleading since it does not tell you that virtually all of the recipes are foreign.I needed a book that would help me with recipes for church dinners. This is not it, and from the title, you would think it would be. I am quite disappointed in this book."
2,Emma Harte is the most controlling woman ever,"Emma Harte is the most controlling woman ever, and her granddaughter Paula isn't much better. Page after page has Emma meddling in people's lives as if she was entitled to just because she had once, long ago, suffered long and hard, and was now wealthy and on top. Annoying and irritating. And isn't she just omniscient -she always sees through everyone's motives - she's always steps ahead of everyone. Oh, sure! If you hate control freaks, don't read this book."
4,Women with goals,"I most certainly enjoyed the book Hold the Dream. I read the book about a year ago and my only regret was that I was not able to get all the books in this set for I only read the one part. I like women who know what they want and set their goals to achieve it. Women are no longer just homemakers but can be expert bussinesswomen. Keep up the good work.Unfortunately, our currency is 2 to 1 US therefore some of the prices are steep."
3,"Disappointed after reading ""A Woman of Substance""",The book dragged for the first half. The author continuously rewrote the first book. The story did not really start until the second half. I was always waiting for the same emotional traumas that Emma experienced but did not really find them in this book. If you read A woman of Substance you might be disappointed with this book.
4,Fantastic Book of Barbara Taylor Bradford Ever Read,"Paula McGill Fairley is another replica of Emma Harte. She is badly suited against Jim Fairley who is a weak person. The way she dealt with Jonathan is what Emma Harte would have done. So to speak, pride comes before a fall."
4,Great gift,"daughter in law loves the longhorns and is taking college class, the bag was perfect. Gig enough for books,calculators, notepads, snacks etc. Being reversable is like 2 bags in one and it washes up nicely."
4,Humorously informative!,I was never a nitpicker- All of the flaws in the show I really never noticed. This book puts you in touch with the story lines of the show and actually helps you appreciate the show with a little giggle here and there.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this (Paid retail) mostly because I thought the colander was cool and couldn't find one like it anywhere else. And when I first opened it I thought it was nice but then as I started to unpack it I changed my mind. First of all everything was plastered together by small hunks of white tape that didn't really come off so your left with a sticky blob on each item. The colander has plastic handles (can't imagine those would last long if actually used for pasta). The pasta was a small bag of standard shells. None of the glass bottles (olives, oil and pepper flakes) had any kind of seal on them. Just screw the top off and there ya go. When I opened the olives the inside of the cap had what looked like a little bit of mold (so did the oil). Of course I packed it back up and promptly returned it. I guess if you want it for decoration only go ahead and buy it but dont expect to actually put the set to use."
3,The interior (where it counts) is not stainless steel,"The interior of these cups is black plastic with a slight ""off taste,"" NOT stainless steel, which is much better. The price was good, and they are pretty much spill-proof which is good, but not enough recommend them."
1,Dribble Cups.,No. Seriously. Just Dribble Cups. That's all. Chinese Joke on Coffee-Drinking American. Ha. Ha. You have coffee all down your shirt.
3,Just an ok mug. Nothing Special,"The price was right and I being the coffee man that I am, figured these would be great mugs. There not. There fine, for the price. Coffee stays warm for only about 2 hours max, the lids are TERRIBLE! They never screw on straight, but those are my only real complaints.HERE IS WHAT YOU WANT TO READ: Should you buy these? Yeah, sure why not. They definitely do the trick. If the price is right for you grab em. I think i overpaid for these, but like i said, the work. Coffee never spills, they have held together and not fallen apart. 3 Stars is about as high as these mugs would ever get."
5,floyds back with a bang,"the pink floyds, truly the pioneer of psychedelic rock music are back with their latest album, ""A tribute to pink floyd"". floyd seem to have lost their purity after Roger Waters left the band but David Gilmour seem to have mesmerized every music freaks. it seems that floyds never made any scarcity of their music. their ealier alblums like ""atom heart mother"", ""the wall"", ""dark side of the moon"", ""wish you were here"", were simply mind bogling. they came out another perfect ten alblum call""the division bell"" which really swept everyone.truly, music is all about the rythym and mind and pink floyd is the only answer. boba sharma"
2,Great product. Poor condition.,Amazing product and really happy with it. However very disappointed with condition of product on arrival. Case was broken and disc was floating inside the case resulting in the disc arriving in bad condition despite being a brand new product.
4,good band but the camera crew for dvd could have done better filming,great concert dvd except for the fact that right many time throughout the dvd the camera was either zoomed in or not angled right but am not sure how to really explain it to where everybody would understand but the camera people should have filmed it better than they did because i have seen alot of concerts on dvd and never seen one all over the place like this one was with the camera but maybe next time they will do better but all in all its a good dvd and good buy
5,Ear Blastingly Outstanding,"Finally a music DVD that does a band justice. The band blows you out of the room,...literally, they sound awsome. And the function that alternates between audience and on-stage mix is excellent, you can really hear the difference and both sound gr8. Believe me, its worth going out and spending thousands of dollars on a sound system just to hear 3 Doors Down play on this DVD, and even better, it plays on Australian DVD players. 3DD are a monumental band, crank it up cuz this DVD shows just how good they really are - a must for any 3DD fan."
5,3 DOORS DOWN -- 5 STARS UP,"This is one of the finest concerts since the new millennium! 3 Doors Down are unquestionably one of the U.S.'s best straight-ahead-rock-and-roll bands. The band is tight, no-nonsense, a true powerhouse. Incredible musicianship and energy from each individual player... live, they are truly electrifying. The production values on this DVD are top notch. I always think live music is the purest and best experience one can have, and I always love a great concert by a great artist/band where the audience is going bananas... that's as good as it gets."
1,BORING,"It was everything I had to not skip ahead to the next track hoping it would be better than the current one at the moment. It was just plain boring. There is no stage energy to start with. And the songs are not catchy by any means. If it wasn't for the bass player and the outstanding drummer, you'd think they were mere robots. I will admit that after watching bands like Nickelback and Shinedown some standards get set in your head, but come on, even Keith Urban puts on 10x the show with unique and catchy songs to boot. Save your money and watch the videos on youtube. Even the mere $7 I spent on this as my ""night out"" left me feeling cheated of my time more than money."
1,HORRIBLE,"I always look for books on how to take care of curly hair because, well, I have it! This book was helpful within the first three pages but went downhill from there. They're were no pictures, models or hair-y stories from the author. Overall, I just didn't like it. I thoroughly recommend ""No Lye"" or ""Curly Girl"" instead of this...just horrible!"
1,"Basic Care for Naturally Textured Hair: Cultivating Curly, Coily, and Kinky Hair (Personal Care Collection)",It's almost shameful to give this book a star. It's completely worthless. Anyone can get published these days.
1,DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR!,"This book was a total let down. I decided to go natural about a year ago and thought this book would be great for styling tips and hair care tips since the words ""naturally textured"" are in the title. WRONG!!! Nothing in this book could help me on my journey of falling in love with my tight curls. The worst part, in my opinion, was the styling section. The only two natural hairstlyes they suggest are a blown-out fro and a twist-out. The rest of the styles require weave, which I prefer not to use. Very disappointing. Take it from me and everyone else...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Another bad review,Yes this another bad review for this book. I was lucky that I was able to look through the book in the store before purchasing it. So I didn't end up wasting money on a book that wasn't helpful. I was looking for a book to give me simple hairstyles for natural hair that a hair novice would be able to do. The majority of the styles were for people with weaves or extensions. There were a few styles for people with short hair. However if you are in between lengths and don't want to put in a weave you were out of luck. You can find better info looking on the internet and spending nothing than buying this book and getting nothing.
4,Baghdad Texas,"I liked what I saw of the movie. Unfortunately, the DVD stopped working 2/3's of the way into the movie. I have seen the movie already and I knew the ending... I can't really complain as it cost a little over $2.00 or so. So, I guess I learned that purchasing a used DVD might be a good thing or it might not."
5,"One of a Kind: The Rise and Fall of Stuey ',The Kid', Ungar, The World's Greatest Poker Player","Excellent read.Read it in a day and a half.The author tells the story very well and your given, right from the begining a sense of his ways.I think it appeals because it tells the story of someone who did things which we all dream about doing, but never had the guts to. In my all time top five"
4,Down and dirty,"A quick glance at a fascinating and troubled life. There's nothing deep here, but Ungar was an original and his life story includes a lot of amazing characters and stories. This is a breezy, fast read along the lines of Amarillo Slim's autobiography, but with a more troubled protagonist travelling a much rockier road. Good stuff."
5,Fascinating insight,"An engrossing biography on a poker legend. This book brings us to the early days of high stakes poker while retelling the meteoric rise and fall of Stuey Ungar, arguably the best no limit poker player of his time.Alan Safani"
4,Some of Best Ungar Stories Told,"Finally some new stories about Stuey Ungar, after years of some of the same told over and over by other writers. I liked the first half of book more than second. First half has great stuff on Ungar's life in New York, his early gambling years, and his rise to top as New York gambler. His relationship with gambler-gangster Vic Romano is told by Stu to author Dalla, who interviewed Ungar for book. Ungar recalls how Romano tried to talk him into going to college, which ungar seems to regret not doing. Also funny is Ungar trying to becme a jockey. For first time ungar's wife and daughter are interviewed, giving their stories.Last halsf of book has some repeats of stories already told elsewhere, and seems to run out of steam, but some good things in their as well."
5,The title says it all...,"A fascinating look into the life of a character unlike anything else the world had (nor is likely to again) ever seen.Stu Ungar managed to live a life of extremes. A prodigy when it cames to his profession, but equally self-destructive. If he had only the first element, he may well still be around, winning tournaments. If he only had the second, he would never have made his mark on history and would have been doomed to simply vanish, like so many others.The fact that he could combine pure genius at the table with a lack of understanding of how the rest of us see the real world is scintillating in itself.A great read which doesn't require one to be a card lover to enjoy it."
4,Expect to read more about Stu not about poker,Although I was hoping to read more detail about Stu's poker games the book held up. Amazing coverage about the evolution of Stu from childhood to his demise. A wonderful tragedy.
3,Not a great work.,"While the book imparts a great deal of information about Ungar's life, the writing is drab and amateurish. I give the authors high marks for research and low marks for style.Of most interest are the beginning and ending chapters. The portrait of a young Stuey growing up in Little Italy provides a viable explanation for Ungar's dysfunctional and tragic adulthood. The final chapters do a good job of providing us with details about Ungar's final rise and fall. It is the beginning and ending chapters that make the book worth reading, since the stories therein had not before been told in such detail.The middle chapters of the book were a tedious read. They seemed to repeat one Ungar ""tale"" after another; perhaps if those tales were not all so similar, they wouldn't have seemed so boring.In sum, this is probably a great book for those who are already Ungar fans. As a literary work, however, it's so-so."
5,Great Read,This is a great book on maybe the best poker player ever. It takls about his mastery of poker and other games and his addictions in life.
3,it's ok,"As I said: it's ok. It's pretty short for biography and there where goes away that fifth star. Also, it's simple - nobrainer - leisure reading. But we can't judge for that non professional writers [minus star]. Overall - pretty good and fast reading. If it would be possible, I would give 3,5 stars."
2,just o.k.,"I cannot see this book as a satisfactory survey of Buddhism in China. First off, it's very vague. Often the author makes sweeping comments about Chinese culture, the role of Buddhism, Confucianism etc. without adequately backing them up with information. Secondly, it's dated: the copyright of 1959 says it all. In fact, about half of the sources cited are French books and articles written on China in the '50s. The last chapter on Modern China is especially anachronistic, where the author posits the impossibility of a Buddhist revival in China (p. 122), something, I would think be proven wrong by today's developments, though he can't be blamed specifically for that. In conclusion, an o.k. general introduction, but not for in-depth study."
3,hi,"this is the greatest book, it has valuable information you wouldn't find anywhere else, get it now."
2,readable yet hardly interesting,"Sadly speaking, most books about Chinese literature written in English can hardly provide a thorough and in-depth understanding of Chinese literature, and this book is no exception. Most of its content is uninteresting, not illuminating, and its written style not attractive. In all, this is a pretty dull and prosaic work from the viewpoint of a native Chinese teacher in Chinese literature such as I am. However, among all works written in English about Chinese literature, this book is still in comparison less faulty and erroneous, less scanty in reading materials. So for any foreigner who only wants to get a preliminary understanding of Chinese literature, I would still recommend this book as a not too bad start, that is why I still use this book as the textbook to teach students from U.S."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A punter's journey.Phaid, as the title suggests, is a punter. Not a singer though, and the book begins with him broke and absolutely nowhere near where he wants to be.In an indeterminate grimy world that is in bad condition due to failed weather technology among other things, Phaid and his luck set out to try and get back to where he works out he should be.A bit seedy, a bit baroque throughout his wanderings, lusts and adventures.3 out of 5"
2,a book for background,"The world is interesting, but the character might be more interesting. Unfortunately he travels across the world and among several different elements of society somewhat passively. We start with him gambling, see a few of his observational insights, and we end with him leaving a gambling table (though not as interesting as the first scene), but the rest of the time our hero is more of a reluctant fighter and sexual opportunist than a gambler. His travels become the excuse to put the world on display. Tension between the classes of society are built up but unresolved. In what passes for adventure our hero keeps pulling off snap shots and escaping, traveling once again to another part of the world until some crisis moves him on. The conclusion of this book must be in the sequel because it was not in this one... but I don't care to finish it."
1,Cannot recommend,"I have purchased several sets of these glasses. The first set ended up cracking eventually. I thought maybe my kids were putting them on the bottom rack of the dishwasher.I purchased a second set and have made sure that they are washed in the top rack only of the dishwasher. Unfortunately, one by one they have all cracked.It is a great buy but not for disposable glasses."
2,Not nearly as good as Men are From Mars...,"I'm a BIG fan of Men Are From Mars..., but this book was disappointing. Too simplistic, too many similes, and it repeated the same points far too many times. He sounds in this book like he's trying to emulate Deepak Chopra or Wayne Dyer. Much respect to Mr. Gray for his relationship books. This topic, however, seems to be outside his area of expertise."
1,Big Disappointment - Couldn't Finish It,"What a disappointment after reading Gray's Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. That book had some profound insights into the cultural differences between the sexes and how that impacts on relationships. I found no profound insights in this book, none whatsoever. To be fair, I didn't read very far. It was just too boring and repetitious. I found myself wondering if this could be the same author. What I read seem to be a neverending pitch for Gray's seminars - sort of a written infomercial."
4,Interesting and informative,"As I liked Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus - this book too helps you to look at yourself and others in a more positive way and I found it helpful, especially if you desire to grow as a person and enjoy learning what makes people tick. It helps you to better appreciate and accept yourself, as well as others. We all have good things about ourselves and things that can be changed. We just need a little more time to do that. This book helps you do just that."
3,"A steal from Vanzant's 1998 ""In the Meantime""???","Rating it a 3 out of fairness and assumption it's at least average, but the info provided here on this book makes me smell a rat: is this just riding the coat tails of Iyanla Vanzant's book from 1998, much touted on Oprah, ""In the Meantime: Find Yourself and the Love you Want""??? Sounds like it, esp. since a phrase from her work says ""Want what you have to get what you want"". Sounds too close for me. And, if it is, this is just emotional ambulance chasing."
1,This book is pure-tee drivel.,"Not only is Gray responsible for the most annoying titles in a best-seller list full of them, his books live up to what the titles promise. If a reader wants to believe that the cliches Gray shovels forth will indeed bring happiness, then they probably will. However, readers with a teensy bit of cynicism will only be turned off by his bromides."
1,"Another Crack-pot, Voodoo, Pop Psychology Offering","Nothing new here...John Gray rides the coatails of those well before him. How many books out there say the same things? Make a plan, follow-it, don't worry, be happy...,etc. It's sad that people make a market for this stuff. I think I'll attach PhD to my name and write a book. Stay tuned...(or just read a little Dale Carnegie)."
1,It's not what I want,"What I want are ladies, and lots of 'em. This book does NOT have the advice I need."
1,The ultimate snake oil man,This book is about the self promotion of John Gray and nothing else. Oh and his conversations with God.
1,This book made me Puke!,"You must be a really empty person to want to indulge in this guy's advice. Out of curiousity, does anyone know what kind of monk Gray was? Catholic? Buddhist?"
1,John gray has gone nuts! he now thinks religion is the key,"Before you get all mad and silly about the title of this, I'm a christian. After reading or listening to every book john gray - men are from from mars, women are from venus fame - loved them all - the key to everything was communication, understanding and empathy.Fine - excellent, in fact. But in this one, he suggests that god is now the key, and if you want improvement in your life, be motivated ... but not in a self-empowered way, but by finding god etc .. I found the religious over tones in this quite overwhelming and very disappointing from a renowned author, who didn't seem to be a disciple in his previous writings - please, c'mon - someone has converted john gray recently!I won't tell on you I promise, but I will never ever read or listen to his stuff again.God is good, but I don't need a self-help guy trying to choke me with the ""message""."
1,Now a guru..please!!!,"His view of God is fluffy and New Agey.His relationship booksI thought were bad enough but this book comes across as though he has some secret information about spiritual matters,,not!!He repeats himself about getting connected with God,and to meit sounds more like ""God source"" as many New Agers say,ratherthan God.More like God source within you,eh,this is too much!I agree with the other reviewer who said it's about selfpromotion.Seems like that to me too.It's kind of a funny book,ok for a good laugh I suppose but not for seriously lookingfor religion or God."
1,He's back.,"More pathetic drivel from the charlatan behind ""Mars and Venus."" Please do not give this man any more money.Look at his picture, for heaven's sake! Do you trust this man?"
5,How meditation can increase your emotional strength.,"We as individuals have so much power within ourselves. John teaches us how to tap into our strengths in a life-changing, world-changing, positive way. The meditation technique is priceless in helping you deal with seemingly insurmountable problems or pressures. I have used the meditation technique and seen it work incredible, wonderful, daily miracles. John truly desires his readers to experience success."
1,Meditation is not the answer to success,"Basically this book says that to be successful you should meditate, and have all of your love buckets filled. If this sounds like your type of plan for success, then buy the book. This book only seems to be for die hard John Gray fans, and people who have everything they thought they wanted and are not happy, or those who are trying to convince themselves that they are happy with their lot in life. Buy an Anthony Robbins' book, or one from someone else who provides practical success insights."
4,Phenomenal Message,"John Gray has an exceptional gift; he expresses his ideas and insight in a simplistic manner. I love and identify with the views he reflects and have occasionally re-read the novel to remind myself of many important lessons to be learnt and re-learnt.I found the book slightly tedious when read without breaks, as many of his views are repeated.Overall the messages that one may extract are well worth the read. Highly recommended for those who desire to improve themselves."
1,Very disappointing,"I have read other John Gray books and have found them wonderful - I usually instantly connect with what he is saying. I was disappointed with this book and couldn't buy into it since his message was so different. The discussions on meditation and religion just seemed so out of place and even though I consider myself to be religious (a Christian), they didn't appeal to me at all. Maybe I got caught off-guard with this one, but I don't want to keep this book on my bookshelf, let alone recommend it to others."
3,One Of His Better Books,"This is one of John Gray's better books,well it doesn't have the usuall tight sex roles and other rigid ""hard wired"" male/female mindset. It is written though for someone who has a bit of a new age thinking and not everyone will care for the ""spirituality"" of it but they may appreciate the more practical side of the book."
5,Changed My Life!,"This book is powerful. It was like a wake up call. If you feel you have been looking in all the wrong places for your answers, look no further. You have found it.I hope you enjoy it as much as I have"
1,Zero stars - This guy may be dangerous,"This guy is a nutcase. I saw him at an all-day seminar called Results 2000. I don't know why they chose him as a speaker. Most of the speakers said something helpful, something practical. John Gray had us all hold our hands in the air until our fingers tingled. He said it was ""healing energy"" we were feeling. Now that our hands were charged with healing energy, we could heal other people or ourselves by putting our hands on those people. He asked us to chant this strange incantation over and over. It was creepy. The guy is in outer space. If you want to read something helpful, don't waste your time here.The time I spent with Self-Help Stuff That Works by Adam Khan (Youme Works; ISBN: 0962465674) was far better than this tripe."
1,Completely Useless,"I was shocked at how bad this CD was. I absolutely loved Mars & Venus so I tried this one. First off he is just talking in a monotone voice that is very boring. It's impossible not to think about other stuff. He doesn't give any useful information, just dances around stuff leaving you confused. The meditation stuff was so lame I about quit right in the middle of the program. Gray struck gold with Mars & Venus but I'm afraid with Get What You Want he struck rock bottom!"
1,Meaningless Dribble,"The title is very misleading. It tells you nothing about getting what you want or wanting what you have, and it is by no means a ""practical"" anything. The author speaks of some ridiculous ""love vitamins"" (e.g., Vitamin G is for God) and then babbles about some ""love tanks"" we all have that we have to keep filled. Then he goes on to chronicle how people act at certain ages and what they need at each age. This is as far as I got before deciding this book was a total waste of time."
1,How To Be Happy All The Time (Goody Gumdrops),"John Gray is no dummy, but he sure knows how to get the money. I was forced to read this book because I was told (and had to agree) that I couldn't be negative without giving it more than a cursory read. What agony I endured. One long drawn out, repetitious pep talk that builds you up until the game is over. Fine as long as you're winning. But not helpful long-range or for those who know happiness is more than a warm puppy."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"Thought it would be a little different then what it was, never finished the book cause it just didn'tkeep my attention."
2,How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to Personal Success,"I purchased this book for a very specific piece of content. The person who recommended it couldn't remember if this content was in this book or in one of Mr. Gray's audio tapes. What I wanted was not in the book and I found the book, overall, to be just another run of the mill self-help book written in a rather sappy way."
4,I love wood..,"The outside is pretty to look at but..had green felt on inside lid a little bumpy, which is not shown and it holds 500 chips not a 400 but the order number on box was the same. One of the chip holders was a little dinged..but not to bad. Other wise good shape and looks nice."
5,Wooden Poker Chip Case,I purchased two of these for my husband for Christmas. He is very picky and likes nice things. He was very pleased with these and I'll be ordering another one.
5,proud owner,"these speakers are amazing, unbelievable clarity and power. The subwoofer can be lound enough to shake any room, whilst the clarity is high to even hear a pin drop. Great buy for a good price!!"
5,A Brave Book,This is a very insightful and brave book. The author uses her extensive clinical experience to simplify and characterize a poorly understood and under appreciated invisible form of abuse. She uses examples from her practice of family and marital therapy to illustrate the five perpetualting cycles of emotional abuse. She also is willing to reveal her own story which is a brave and courageous approach. She does this in order to involve readers more completely in understanding how emotional abuse effects all aspects of relationships.
2,"La Crosse Technology WT-3181PL 18"" atomic outdoor clock","La Crosse Technology WT-3181PL 18"" Atomic Outdoor ClockIt never set to the correct time, it is a radio controlled clock that did not work."
2,Not too thrilled,"This might be an okay clock for a garage, shed or barn but it doesnt seem to perform well in the raw elements like the rain.I had a similar protraction problem that caused faulty readings as a result of the rain, like someone else had described. They should not present this as a no outdoor clock.In a sheltered area, it might be a 5 star clock."
1,Yikes! Faulty wiring!,"Total dud! This clock must have had a short or something, because it caused the battery to overheat and explode. I had the battery in (in the correct orientation) for less than 5 minutes -- when I went back to check and see if the clock had set itself yet, I heard crackling, smelled something funny, and turned it around to notice the cover to the battery was melted. I had to pry out the sizzling/bubbling battery with a plastic spoon and leave it outside because of the acid leaking out of it. Needless to say, it was immediately returned."
5,Out door clock.,"This lovely clock was easy to set up and looks very elegant in our out door area. We like all the facilities of, time, humidity and temperature."
2,Doesn't keep correct time,"This was a replacement for the same model I've had for years, but this one seems to have a hard time locking in on the correct time - it was 15 minutes behind for the first several days. Happened when first setting it up, then it seemed to work for several months, but recently it went back to being 15 minutes behind, and today I noticed it was 7 minutes behind. So, even a mental correction I might apply to it is not reliable because it changes. I like the visibility - it's great for the back yard - but I don't think I'll buy another one."
5,Large Display,"I read some reviews and was a little skeptical but purchased anyway. I was not able to get it to connect with atomic clock initially for auto setting. However, after manually setting it and checking with my Citizen Echo Drive watch that does sync the clock appears to be working. Right now all I can assume is that it is now syncing but other than checking with another device there is no way to guarantee it does."
1,Displayed incorrect time,"I bought this item as a gift. Before giving I wanted to set it up for the recipient. I followed the instructions and had it working briefly. Once wrapped, I heard the hands cycling quickly around the clock (as if searching for the correct time). I unwrapped it and called for tech support. They offered some options, mostly changing the battery. Once done with that it began running at the proper speed, but was off by 3 hours (for every time zone). I'm done with this hassle and returning to amazon."
2,Clock finally working,"I highly anticipated a clock that gave me great time and minimal fuss to get it going. Truth be told the clock is finally keeping perfect time but took exactly six days of manipulation and teasing to get it to work properly. No matter what I did( and I did everything recommended by the booklet) nothing worked. The clock had a mind of its own. Even though the clock was pointed west with no obstructions it would not set itself correctly. It started out by being an hour slow and after numerous days and re- settings finally adjusted itself by some miracle to the correct time. It would have been helpful if I could have made contact with the company but after leaving five messages with them I gave up. Eventually two weeks later they returned my calls saying that they had a computer malfunction and weren't able to service my call. Anyway, the clock is working perfectly but the aggravation definitely wasn't worth it."
1,Dissapointed,"This clock is great looking, the perfect size for outdoors and well insulated but we could not get it to keep time. We tried the manual and automatic setting. We went to the makers website and tried everything they suggested without success. After 2 1/2 weeks of trying we finally gave up and sent it back. We didn't want to do that because we loved everything else about the clock. But, after all what good is a clock that doesn't keep time? Unless you live in the Pacific time zone, I wouldn't waste my money on this."
1,Beware if using outside,"I purchased this for use on my patio as it says it is an indoor/outdoor. However, when reading the instruction manual it says that it is NOT water resistant and should only be used outside where it will be dry. So unless you are living in the middle of the Mojave Desert, I would find another option. It was returned immediately."
5,Automatic Atomic Clock,"Upon opening package and inserting batteries, clock adjusted time automatically-Love the clockSize was what I wanted. Highly recommended item"
3,Great While It Lasted,"Bought this clock over three years ago. It set itself and kept perfect time (on one battery) until this fall (2012), when it began to change time erratically. I thought it was the battery, so I changed it. No change. There may have been a little corrosion within the battery chamber. It moved a little but then stayed on 11:45. So I bought a new, different, non-atomic clock."
2,Atomic Clock,"The clock itself is beautiful. Unfortunately it does not keep accurate time and that is why I am giving it two stars. It is 33+ minutes off. We tried fresh batteries, setting by the window, etc. and when it finds its WWVB signal, it is still 33+ minutes off. I would send back but unfortunately I do not have the original packaging to return it in. I've called the La Crosse Product Support Help number twice and an answering service takes a message stating someone technical will call back and to date, no one has returned our calls to try and help. The website did not provide any help either. So, it is a $49.99 manual set clock. It's a shame. I could have bought a cheaper/bigger manual set clock."
4,Good clock but not packaged well,"The clock itself is great, looks modern and works like it should. The problem is that the manufacturer only covers one side of the clock with the box, leaves the glass and 1/2 of the other side open, so I had to return the first one because it arrived with the glass shattered. The second one was scratched on the one side that was not covered with packaging. I kept it because I needed a clock and didn't feel like dealing with a second return...it's not so bad when you look at it from far away in a yard, but if you are looking for perfection, just be forewarned. Overall, for the price, I guess you can't be too picky, it's a very good value."
3,misleading name,the clock was fine but its miss leading. its a clock that can only be used on an enclosed patio. not a true outdoor clock.
5,"Nice, big clock","We've had this for several years. It works great and is very accurate and is easy to read. Our friends liked ours so well, they bought one for their pool."
4,"Jimmy Dolittle: A Truly Amazing PersonThis book, while not outst","This book, while not outstanding prose, describes the life of a truly amazing and gifted man and the contributions he made to aviation in the 20th century."
3,"Company Tried to resolve problem, and did so, but with a bit of difficulty","Overall, the product is worth the trouble. However, the company failed to ship my product and then said it was my fault. However, I am serving in Afghanistan and have no difficulty receiving items. Be that as it may, the company only decided to help me once asked Amazon for their assistance in obtaining a refund. The company then mailed my product.In the end, I received my product 2 months after making the order and it was worth it. The gloves are high quality. It would have been nicer without the nasty email exchange and having to go through Amazon to get them to respond, however."
1,formulaic romance disguised as pedestrian fantasy,"Take the standard story from a trashy romance novel. Use both historical and pseudo-scientific alchemy as a background. Toss in some unbelievably trite alien overlords. Add some actually quite serviceable prose, and you get this book. If that sounds like the sort of thing you like, go for it. Personally, I hated it."
3,Nothing New,"First off let me say that i enjoyed this book - however it has been done before - countless times. I cant tell you how many books involve a person being chased by ""the bad guys"" and the heroine just runs into mini adverture after mini adventure, solving all easily with no real chance of death. This book is about an apprentice poison worker that meets a master of poison/assasin and spend much of the book running. There are flashbacks to 15th century earth to help explain how and why these people ended up on this distant planet enslaved by aliens. This is a very interesting sub plot, but not one that is needed. I mean do we really need to know why people are on a plantet? Usually its enough for the author to jsut tell us they are there and for the reader to accept it...Anyhow bring this one along if you have a long car trip...otherwise dont bother..."
4,Nice product - over priced,"I really like this product. Easy to read. Great having the date and day on it. I am retired and it isn't always easy remembering what day it is! The temp is off by about 4 degrees. I purchased a new sensor, but haven't tried it yet."
1,Really?,"I cannot echo the rave reviews of this book. The picture it paints of God the Father trying to find a bride for His Son and choosing a woman who had ""potential"" does not agree with God's Word. He chose me when I was utterly dead and lost in my sins. There was no potential there, but He chose me anyway.God the Father is also said to be waiting helplessly for His own bride, ""Rachel"", who is described as His Son's ""mother"" to return to Him. The God of the Bible does not sit around waiting, wringing His hands and wishing things would happen (and Israel is not Jesus' Mom). Arthur is no John Bunyan; her attempt at allegory is just plain awkward.If you want to read a really great metaphor of God's love for Israel, and Christ's love for the church, I would recommend you leave this one on the shelf and read the Book of Hosea instead."
4,Everlasting,Good and easy read based on unconditional love and forgiveness. This book paints a good picture of how we feel when we mess up and yet how quick the Lord is to forgive us and take us as we are.
5,With an Everlasting Love by Kay Arthur,With an Everlasting Love is one of the most beautifully written books to lead a person to the love of Jesus Christ. It is also incredible for any believer to see the unfailing and unconditional love of Christ. Every woman and every man should read this book.Ginny R.
5,An innocent girl on trial for murder,"The story takes place in post-Victorian Edinburgh. A bankers daughter begins (too late) to notice all is not perfect in her perfect household. Her mother dies. Her governess is let go under mysterious circumstances. And a bawdy new governess moves in to take her friend and her mothers place---and all other things. Her father is discovered dead from arsenic poisoning---and she is accused of murdering him. I was surprised at the end---I felt sure I knew who had killed the girls father----but I'm not good at guessing, I guess.The characters are pretty well thought out---theres a voyage to South Africa and the terrain is detailed. But the most standout of this book is the main characters illusions that the perfect way of life can go on uninterrupted. She certainly left one snare of serpents for another, too. Very well written and interesting."
1,Didn't get it,"Ordered a romance novel for my wife's bithday, never received item. Waited until the last estimated date of delivery, which was several weeks later, before contacting seller. Couple of e-mails later refund was requested and obtained."
5,Barbie My Scene...was a big hit at the birthday party,"The Barbie My Scene was a great gift for a [...]birthday party. The seller was great too! Fast, efficient delivery, thank you! This doll, Madison had a very charming face and cool clothes. Fun."
1,Primitive Rebels,"I was required to read this as part of a non-western intensive writing course in college and it was the hardest book to get through. I am a Biology major so this is out of my realm of comfort and maybe that is why I did not enjoy it as much as the other reviewers. I found an arrogance in the style of Hobsbawm's writing which really bothered me. Overall, my favorite part of this book was the part where I put it down."
3,Good video for collectors and music history buffs.,"The video is pretty good. If you are into music history, particularly reggae, you should have this in your collection. Dub music is very significant and this video gives some insight into the careers of some of Reggae and Dub musics best producers, musicians and engineers."
5,From a time long ago.,"It's too bad the body of work from the Downsiders wasn't more expansive. But, this is one of my all time favorite recordings. Takes me back to a packed Burro Room in downtown Chico. Definitely worth getting your hands onto if you were ever a fan of the Downsiders."
2,"Sorry, but not worth the price.","The pasta casserole dish (made in China) arrived chipped in several places and portions of the glaze were flaking off as well. This could not have been due to shipping but rather poor workmanship / product defect. For the price, I expected better quality. I was disappointed."
1,Disappointed,When I first received this item it was broken. When I received the replacement the oil was leaking from the bottle. Printed on the bottom it says for decorative use only. I was looking for something useful not ornamental. On the whole I was quite disappointed in this item.
1,Not worth it,After such a long waiting period for this item it arrived broken. I would never have paid more than 5 dollars for this item. Just not worth it. Oh and the 25 pound shipping rate is not correct. Really not worth the money is all I can say.
5,Brain teasing fun.,"I couldn't put it down, I finished the book in two weeks. But trust me, it gets a bit difficult near the end. Worth it!!!"
5,Mel Bay Wedding Music for the Lever Harp Book/CD,I am very happy with the format and the variety of music; Congratulations to Beth A Kolle and Laurie Riley for this insight. I have performed at weddings for many years and I feel the plan at the beginning of the book is very good for anyone who has not had this experience. It's very clear and easy to understand. I also like the CD for the correct tempo of pieces that I didn't know before. I love the book;
5,A Cup of Tea and This Book = Perfect Combination,"What a pleasure to find this book! Here we have regular women from the ""fly-over-zone"" with all the intrigue and angst of the hottest Hollywood celebrities, without all the hype. The book is laugh-out-loud funny in many places, but I was particularly struck by how much I learned. For example, you can learn where to find the best buys on eBay for beads and bargaining techniques that would take months to learn on your own. One essay deals with the exuberance of life when contrasted with a friend's impending death; that one will let you step out into your life with a greater appreciation for it. Another essay details strategies for getting money from your mother, including an imaginary catalogue of letters to garner sympathy from Mom: ""Dear Mom, I learned today that when trash cans are labeled ""inedible,"" that isn't always true..."" More follow. The book makes a perfect ""chick gift"" for many laughs and much insight into ordinary lives."
5,Great Mother's gift,"I loved the humor in this book -- especially the piece about guilting out your parents to get them to send money. Even my mother got a laugh out of that one. And the piece about cinnamon rolls was sexy (my boyfriend got more than a laugh). All in all, it's a fun dip-in-and-out read. I'll probably buy a few to keep for quick gifts -- better than the same-old bottle of wine or flowers."
2,Some Good Stuff,"This is a collection of short stories written by individuals in a writers' group. I ordered it after having read two favorable reviews that peaked my curiosity. Though I'm not a fan of the short, I applaud the honesty, the idea and the writing. The most important thing about this book for me, though, is how pivotal it's been in my life. You never know where inspiration will come from. One of the stories inspired me to try something, something important that I would not have tried had I not read the book. Whoever wrote 'that' story, thank you."
4,"Good, but not as good as chocolate","I could definitely identify with some of the essays, but others bored me and I didn't finish them. The variety of emotions, situations, and life experiences were entertaining and did lead to some introspection. I wouldn't say this is a ""must read,"" but it's an enjoyable book that was perfect to read in bits, as the 42 essays are short."
4,Colaw's choice,"I was very satisfied with the quality and the speed with which the order was filled,shipped,and received."
1,VHS 8 Hour Tapes,"One package of the 8 hour VHS tapes are ""poor"" quality. The plastic package shipping cover was broken and did not cover the tapes. In the same package the tapes did not look new. The tapes had been removed from the cardboard covering and replaced. I have tried using several of the tapes in this package to no avail. I find they are poor quality tapes and can not be used for recording. request replacement."
4,VHS tapes,I was relieved to still be able to locate some of these. We are still using two VCRs and a DVR.
2,Cute but tiny.,"This book will fit in the palm of your hand. Read the discription carefully and note size. Also the book is 93 pages not 128. It looks like the big book but is not even close to the same book. It is Edited by Alida Becker, Illustrations by Michael Green, Color Illustrations by Tim Kirk. A Running Press Miniture Edition. DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COVER!"
3,It's Ok.,"It's a nice little book, that's it. It has some poems about Tolkien and his world with no rhymes (mostly) and some quotes. Some older people or some professors :) might like it, but not me. The only reason I gave it three stars is because it had two funny poems in there."
4,"spiritually uplifting, tragic and inspiring, fulfilling","If you are looking for alternatives to ways on approaching your father, this book tells you how others have managed to do it. Fathers are a part of who we are and present in our lives or not, their power to influence us to the spirit is undaunting. If you have not said,""I forgive you dad"", this book will help you find that way to do it. If you hate your father too, read this, you are not alone. It helps you rid your self of that hate and anger and helps you deal with better. Father Songs is a book that all sons should read if they value their fathers in any way, good or bad."
5,LOVE IT,i fell in love with this necklace from the first sight .. and it came as i thought .. i mean the closing style ..
1,poor customer service,"I have bought three of these, two as gifts.One of those bought as gifts (for my father-in-law, naturally) died in less that 6 months. The LCD flickers, it cannot be reset, will not lock to the signal, and reads the temp neither indoors or out.When I contacted the email listed on the back of the clock, I was told that they no longer made that model and would not replace it. No other contact info is available.As an Engineer, I am highly offended by the idea that you can make a defective product and then eliminate any warranty returns by simply not making it anymore. By the way, they make the identical clock except that now it has the phase of the moon. Same clock, same price, no warranty.Cool idea, neat clock when it works, but buy from a more reputable company with actual warranty protection!"
2,Needs some work....,"I have had this product for about two years. All this while I had a good signal lock and the time was accurate. Then my battery (two AAs) were low so I replaced them with new ones; deligently following instructions specified in the manual. Ever since I keep losing my signal link and the clock runs slow. I moved the clock around just in case there was interference (although it worked fine for the last 2 years) all for nought. I don't have any new appliances that could cause interference that were not in the same location for the last 2 years.What is needed is a manual ""force link"" button so as to link-up with the radio waves. My Casio watch has this why can't this clock?All in all an OK product but next time I'm going with Oregon Scientific. I am told that their product is more reliable by far."
4,I'd be lost without my atomic clock,I love this clock. It gives you the EXACT time. What's funny is how nearly every broadcasting medium uses this. Try it and see. Turn on your nearest AM radio at the top of the hour and it will nearly always begin a national news feed to the second! I'd give this one a 5 rating except that it doesn't have the moon phase display. Others have it.
2,Cassette vs. CD,"Again when asked to write a review for this product, it was listed as a CD! It arrived as a cassette. I returned it unopened."
5,A must for anyone who seriously wants to read Tarot!!,"This book has really helped me read the Tarot better. This book is much much more than a book of card definitions. Rickleff does readings for characters like Cinderella, Joan of Arc, George Baily from the movie ""It's a Wonderful Life"".By doing readings for familiar characters Rickleff gives us wonderful examples of how the cards come into play in a reading. This has given me a deeper understanding of the tarot and how to do my own Tarot readings.Another great thing about this book is the section on reversals. I have found his approach on how to use reversals extremely helpful and usable."
3,Well-Written,"I love the idea of this book. After some introductory stuff (which is quite good), Ricklef gives a series of readings for characters from history, myth, and ""familiar"" stories. I put quotations around familiar because I was not familiar with about a third of the stories. Ricklef relies heavily on Greek myth and Shakespeare for inspiration. For someone with a more classical education this would probably be great, but I majored in physics and managed to get by reading only 2 Shakespeare plays in my life (neither of which were in this book). Of the Greek myths, I knew about half of them.I throughly enjoyed the readings done for charaters I did know, such as the Ugly Duckling, Belle from the Beauty and the Beast, and Einstein. Also, the card descriptions in the back, which seem almost as an afterthought, are very good. Ricklef gives some relevant life advice after each card. Quite inspiring!"
5,Out of print... but there's a new edition!,"I was recently recommended to buy this book, but discovered that it is out of print. There are used copies available here through non-Amazon sources, but I wanted a new copy. With just a little research, I discovered that there is a new edition of this book! Its new title is ""Tarot Reading Explained"" and it is an updated version, so that was an even happier discovery. See:Tarot Reading Explained"
2,Not ready for Prime Time,"This scope has great optics for the money and is fairly easy to use. It also falls short with it's tracking abilities, at first Ithought it was user error untill I talked with several dealers andfound that this was a common complaint. If you spend just a littlemore for the 5I or the 8I you will be very pleased, its like money in the bank because they hold there value quite well."
1,When was this book written? In 1975?!,"The proposed menus and arrangements in this book look like something from the Brady Bunch wedding. The recipes are a throw-back to an earlier time of cocktail wieners on toothpicks. Don't look for any vegetarian items, fusion cooking, or creative or modern recipes.If you are planning a wedding at a retirement community--this is the book for you. If you are under the age of 50, keep looking."
2,Okay - if you just want to feed your guests,"I was very disappointed with this book. The recipes lack imagination and creativity. I would put them in a ""potluck"" category. As mentioned by other reviewers, the authors assume you have a staff of volunteers who can assist before, during, and after the reception. Although they make suggestions on how to arrange a buffet, they don't offer much as far as presentation is concerned so that it doesn't LOOK like a do-it-yourself job. If you are having a casual or informal wedding reception and have LOTS of people to help, then this book may be useful to you. If your goal is to have a formal or elegant wedding, or if you want to have your friends and relatives to actually ENJOY your wedding, then you should pass on this book."
4,Excellent buffet diagrams,"The best use I got of this book was the excellent buffet table diagrams given. I am changing the buffet layout of my reception because of the ideas in this book. Easy to understand. Really gives details on how to plan to DIY, including time needed for various steps in preparing food by inexperienced friends."
2,Mediocre recipes using too much mayonnaise,"I got this book because I am doing some of the food for my wedding and wanted some large quantity recipes. There aren't that many recipes to choose from and they weren't particularly innovative or good looking. Doing baked beans out of the Van Camp's Pork n' Beans cans isn't my idea of good food. That said, if you are just completely lost but want to do your own food this book basically does all the planning for you- provided that you have enough people to pull it all off. The plans are just so specific that it doesn't leave much room for flexibility."
5,Terrific Resource!,"What a terrific resource for those of us who want to do our own receptions our own way! The step-by-step instructions, shopping lists, timelines, and decorating ideas are great, and the recipes and menu plans are diverse, scrumptious, and best of all, simple to prepare. Unlike one of the previous reviewers, I'm not looking for complicated, spend-a-week-trying-to-understand-the-directions recipes (what the heck is fusion cooking anyway???). What I want to serve my guests is delicious food that's presented beautifully and elegantly and that won't send the people who have volunteered to help me with my reception into apoplectic fits. That's exactly what I found in Cater Your Own Wedding. If you're even considering doing your own reception, you've GOT to have this book!"
2,Terrible!,"I was very enthusiastic when I first ordered the book, UNTIL I saw the recipes.. Yikes!! For example, the author insists on using canned vegetables. I have 15 people ready to help me out.. with nothing to cook. I would NOT use these recipes. Terrible.. Terrible.. Ideas! I would be ashamed of serving these items at my wedding!!!"
4,Great information,"The workouts are tough. The science behind the method make sense. I have seen improvement in myself. The last half the book contains workout plans, some of which are repetitive."
5,Excellent Book,"The level of intensity of one of these workouts does not come out in written word. While you will be able to get done with your workout in well under half the time, you may be laying on the ground in exhaustion during the time you saved. I have followed Charles Staley since his Muscle Media days and as always he comes across as very knowledgeable and professional and writes in a no-B.S. manner. Sure to allow you to make new progress in your lifting efforts. Overall a great book!"
3,So far so good,"I haven't fully committed to the workout routines yet, so I can't accurately judge the results, however I like the ideas and principles behind this book."
1,I do not recommend this book,"I have been a body-builder for over thirty years, and have avidly read and studied many books, perhaps twenty, on the subject.Most have taught me something useful. If nothing else, I learn a new routine or two, or a useful tip.However, I learned nothing from this book; the author somehow latched onto his idea of a better way to lift, and offers it with no technical or third-party support for its usefulness. I tried the techniques and found them of no real value. There is a good reason for this: in my opinion, the ideas advanced in this book are useless.I am not one to go out of my way to cause problems for others, but my sincere advice is to purchase books by other authors, whose insights are the result of great experience, their own education in this field, and are improved by the input of their peers. This book does none of that."
1,"New Book, Old Method","This book is essentially supersets...check out some of the Weider publications and you'll find they essentially contain almost 100% of what Staley claims as new information. Better, do some creative googling and you'll find all of the necessary information on a couple of websites.In addition, the book provides a substantial amount of misinformation. For example, he recommends explosive reps for building muscle (research has shown for hypertrophy vs. strength) you need controlled, heavy weights that range between 8 - 12 reps.Best, google on Mark Berry and discover the ""Da Vinci"" of weight training...the man who truly wrote ""the book"" on weights and bodybuilding."
5,Controlling fatigue at 72 Years old.,"I have been following the EDT program since early March...3 days a week for 45 minutes of intense exercise. I am 72 years old and have been weight training since I was 66 years old to stay fit, battle the bulge, and maintain better health.I really like the intensity, the time limits, and the need to plan a routine. Most importantly I am much less fatigued than the traditional pump and grind program caused. I recommend the book and the program highly.Great for home work outs and for time short persons."
3,NOT for use in commerical gyms,Calisaxman has it right. EDT is GREAT in theory and I wish I could test it out...but it's impossible to put to use in a commercial gym because you always need to tie up 2 pieces of equipment at once. I even work out at odd times when the gym is less crowded but there's always someone else who wants to use a station I'm using. Staley seems smart and if you have your own very well-equipped private gym I'm sure it would work for you. Wish I did.
2,not so satisfied,"I've not tried the system yet, but on the book there is not any scientific reference or any exhaustive explanation about what he is writing on."
5,Great for covered outdoors.,"These are great for covered outdoor patios. Not fully water resistant, so must be covered. The optional (sold separate) brackets work fine for mounting. These sound better than my indoor 8"" ceiling Infinity's. Go for these if partially covered, otherwise you'll have to get the expensive Polk's or Boston's for full water resistance."
3,"""Someplace North Of Hell And South Of Heaven"" ~ When Purgatory Shuts Down","What would happen if Purgatory ceased to serve it's primary function of moving departed souls along to the next and final phase of their Afterlife? Certainly would mean there'd be a lot of human souls piling up in a hurry. It's quite an interesting concept for a storyline don't you think?The 'Despiser' has a truly inventive storyline and does the best it can to deliver some entertainment value to the viewer. Yes it was filmed on a very low budget with a cast of unknowns and the special effects are somewhat disconcerting but when all is said and done I think it does a surprisingly admirable job of delivering the goods. The ending is absolutely perfect!Again, don't expect too much and you might be surprised. I would say it's worth a watch or two.My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-."
4,A very decent budget title..,"I was totally surprised by how much I enjoyed watching this film. It has an interesting storyline: an artist, down on his luck, gets zapped into Purgatory and gets involved in the struggle between Good and Evil.The director takes a more down-to-Earth approach to depict this fight; mixing car chases and gunfights along with the traditional demons and monsters. I also liked the way the director used computer generated images as a cost cutting way of depicting the underworld and certain action scenes. The CGIs are not great, but they are decent enough. This is a very solid B-Grade movie."
1,Horrifying !,"Nothing that hasnt been said about this hasnt been written already. I just watched it today and boy, first 5 seconds and I knew this was goona be a horrible movie. What a waste of my time! Philip Cook has the nerve to flash his name above the movie title like in the styles genre of steven spielberg or m night..well now at least I know..avoid the movie when you see Philip Cook!"
3,"""Someplace North Of Hell And South Of Heaven"" ~ When Purgatory Shuts Down","What would happen if Purgatory ceased to serve it's primary function of moving departed souls along to the next and final phase of their Afterlife?

2,Could have been worse...What???,"Well, it was interesting...sorta...but really a bad movie..the cgi sucked...but it was supposed to.I got this pretty cheap...but it was not worth the S/H.I would take the S/H for the move...if someone want's it.<>Lon<>"
1,Bizarre,"There are some interesting ideas in Despiser, certainly, but it's hard to deny that the film is a mess. Tacky CG aside, the acting is sub-par and the plot is full of holes and never seems totally cohesive. You'll find yourself asking, ""Why are there malls or car dealerships in purgatory?"" or ""How long have they been driving down that bridge?"" Character development isn't great, either, with an older, wise, black man doing what older, wise black men do in these films and a Japanese character who looks more Latino than anything else.It's the kind of film you and your buddies might rent for laughs (you get to see the main character fight one of those tiny, plastic, pink-haired trolls on more than one occasion), but I can virtually guarantee that it's not worth paying $25 or more for."
3,Nice Technique but marginally useful for instruction,I found this DVD marginally useful. Remy's technique is remarkable however his broken English and disjointed presentation did not make the DVD worth the price. If you took a portion and put it on a late night humor show it would be a reall success as he twists and turns his students joints while they twitch in pain.
5,Great French-English/English-French Dictionary,It's a great dictionary. My daughter says it helps her make A's in her French class.
3,It was alright.,"The product was heavier than I hoped it would be. I actually owned the Pocket dictionary, but I lost it. I recommend you buy the Pocket dictionary because of it's lighter, although, it's not pocket sized."
3,Big as a Brick,"I brought both this dictionary and the ""pocket"" dictionary to bring on a trip to Paris. Well, this version is enormous - I won't even bring it. And the ""pocket"" dictionary by the same publisher wouldn't fit into any pockets of mine. It's the size I would leave on my desk to study with - not for trips."
5,Comprehensive yet easy to use.,"I purchased this dictionary because I was studying for an upcoming exam- it was a translation exam and I was allowed to have only one dictionary at my side. This was it ! I passed in no small part due to the ease-of-use and the clarity of the definitions.The typeface is easy to read and the multiple definitions are clear and easy to understand. I found the translations to be helpful even when facing idioms and proverbs in reading. The number of entries is very good for a dictionary this size- it's certainly not pocket-sized, but it's not a brick, either. It's a perfect student dictionary for levels beginner through intermediate (advanced students may, of course, need something more specialized.)Highly recommended !"
4,okay,bought this for girl-friend and I think the books is okay. didn't see it for my self though. but she likes it. and she finds every word she's looking in it. so I recommend this one :)
2,Don'y buy these! Buy the Mexican originals instead.,"The shell of these maracas is too thick and there is not enough volume within the maracas to produce the variety of sounds that I require for my music. Because the shell is so thick, it adds unnecessary weight, which impedes movement for faster tempo music. Furthermore, these maracas have a somewhat dull sound due to the poor quality wood.Look elsewhere for a decent pair of maracas!"
2,Keep looking . . .,"I purchased 4 sets of the maracas and they look nothing like the picture; which was beautiful. The design, color, and wood are completely different. While I did not select them to use as a musical instrument, but as accents for my catering business, I'm still debating whether or not to go through the hassle of returning them. I rated them as a 2 only because I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 1 due to the very good packaging and quick delivery.This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in selecting anything from Amazon. I agree with another reviewers comment; ""Look elsewhere for a decent pair of maracas!"""
5,Sounds great!,Does exacdtly what it is designed to do. Nice rich sound. It fills out the rythym section with a mellow low sound.
4,Fun to play!,These are holding up well with a fair amount of use. The kids really enjoy working with them. A good beginning set of maracas.
5,High quality bolster,This is a good prop for prenatal yoga. It is also great to sit on keeping your spine erect for good posture and relieving discomfort in pelvic region.
2,Disappointing,"Maybe this book is a good one for some people, but I was expecting pictures of deer that would help young hunters identify their age. I read the first couple of chapters and it is quite dry and boring. Again, good for some people I'm sure, but not me."
2,Quality whitetails: the how and why of quality deer managment,"i was highly dissapointed with this book, if your are looking for more technical material and studies, this is the book for you.i found little practical info for the novice"
4,too many technical facts,"i thought the book was very informative for beginners. If you're not a beginner and you've either farmed a little bit or have managed deer and built food plots in the past, dont buy this book because you won't finish reading it. I was looking for something more when I bought this book but they teach you the same ole thing, and it's mainly for large landowners. but overall for beginners, it's a great book."
3,Not up to In a Dry Season,"I love Peter Robinson's work, and I thought *In a Dry Season* was a superb novel. I must say I found *Aftermath* something of a letdown -- I don't think Robinson fully transcended all the grisly cliches of the 'serial murder' plot (but then, I hate serial murder plots). Still, it's well worth reading, and the character development of Banks continues to be fascinating,"
4,Vintage Peter Robinson,I really enjoyed this book. Peter Robinson's characters grow with each book and so does my interest in them. A painful topic very well dealt with.
1,Aftermath : A Novel of Suspence,"This is the longest 466 page book that I have ever read. The the Holy Bible is a quicker read. It was the first Peter Robinson book that I've read and undoubtedly the last. Stephen King must have been paied handsomly to sing the praises of the Alan Banks series. I can't believe that a book of this calibur was even publised in such an overloaded genre. In the words of Simon Cowell, ""this book was absolutly deadfull."""
4,Better than average British police mystery,"This mystery novel concerns detective work related to identifying a serial killer in the British Midlands. The protagonist is the police detective responsible for solving these crimes. Though he works hard at his job, he makes believable mistakes, particularly because of incomplete information from others and because of his own erroneous assumptions. The complications of his personal life don't help. The book initially succeeds in luring the reader into the same false lead to the killer. As the story develops, the identity of the real killer becomes increasingly obvious. There is a bit too much dialogue about police business. American readers may find the compulsive smoking and drinking somewhat retro."
2,Flat at End,Book starts out with a bang with 2 young police officers going on domestic call to find horror in basement .Maggie the abused neighbor calls it in . This book kinda flat lines after that and the end is boring to me .
2,Long winded. Slow building.,"The first 80 pages of the book made me throw it down in disgust. I don't care for one page long descriptions of the contents of a dead characters purse. Over and over the author went into too much detail for irrelevant character development that didn't have ANYTHING to do with the story. To say the least, that tends to be boring.The last part of the book started to be intriguing but then it fell flat. Not ENOUGH development. Too much character interplay between the detective and the two women that are part of his life and not enough detail on the killers motives. If I wanted a romance, I would have bought one.I won't read another one of his books."
3,Aftermath,"This book is a departure from Robinson's usual form. Not really a mystery as the book starts with the solution and then explains why the various characters acted in the way that they did. For me, it was a disappointment. Not a great read but not a total waste of time either."
1,PURE NONSENSE!,"This book is the typical fair for those who have a tabloid mentality and are superstitious, rather than objective. Nostradamus' writings are so completely vague that they can be readily interpreted any way one wishes. This is why they are constantly rehashed and reinterpreted to be repackaged and resold to every superficial sap with a buck to waste."
1,"shoddy quality, deceptive packaging","I bought this air cleaner because of the cool remote control/air quality sensor, which is designed to regulate the fan speed based on the pllution of the air. The remote just died after a few hours of use.Also, the packaging makes it appear that this is an electrostaic air cleaner. It is not, rather the ""HEPA"" air filters are made of a woven plastic material.I bought this unit at Target and will return it right away."
3,Buddhism in the West,"Following the Buddha's death, Buddhism experienced a schism which nurtured its development through three main vehicles -- the Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana faiths. Since then, the different schools of thought have retained predominantly separate lines of ontogeny, with only sporadic cross-pollination. However, exportation of Buddhism to the West has provided a unique opportunity for the different familial lines of Buddhism to cross and fuse again. With this book Joseph Goldstein provides ""insight"" into the current state of Western Buddhism."
5,I LOVE IT! SHORT AND SWEET...,This is an excellent book that sheds so much light on life itself and true purpose. Highly recommended.
3,Entertaining and thought provoking,"Okay, if you are looking for detailed plans for building a working anti-G device this is not the book for you. If you want to learn to look at science and the world in a different way then buy this book. You will find some really cool and off the wall theories as well as some entertaining fiction. I enjoyed this book immensely and so did my 8 year old daughter. After reading this book you will be inspired to do further research in anti-g field. T.T. Townsend and A. Einstien were not kooks and their ideas are valid. Buy this book and start experimenting for yourself."
3,"Flying Saucers, a real life passion","Len Cramp is the typical eccentric Englishman. Whatever you think of the science behind his books you can be sure that they are, to him, very serious in nature and present his heartfelt view of the way things are.Many people who write ""fantastic science"" books are complete charlatans. Len is not and he uses the money from his books to fund even more, completely serious, wacky and expensive experiments.Buy the book because its fun, buy it because you beleive, buy it so that people like Len get more chance to make the world a far more interesting place. You never know... he might be right!"
2,Anti-Gravity Handbook,"Like many books of this type, it has some tongue in cheek moments. It talks about flying saucers, anti-gravity projects and general pseudo-science. I enjoy reading these mindless books, but the author really needs to have an English speaking person proof read these before publishing. I also find it amazing how many mis-spelled words and odd paragraphs are in here. I know the author is not a native English speaker, so you would think someone that is would read this and edit it properly. Has some interesting pictures of the Nazi saucer mythos and all as well. Some drawings and photocopies of texts. Good if you are interested in this stuff and I have added to my collection, but all of these books would have more credibility if they had more polished editing."
4,The Anti-Gravity Handbook,"This book gives an excellent introduction tothe world of anti-gravity theory. The Biefield-Browneffect is explored along with other anti-gravity theories.Possibilities of time travel, teleportation and warp driveare explored. The editor, David Hatcher Childress does anexcellent job of putting the writings of four different authors, including himself,together to fill out this work."
3,Download/Ohgr,"For the vets that may have expected to hear a new skinny puppy album may be dissappointed. This is a Download and Ohgr blend. I do like it, but I am disappointed, for I thought I may get the old authentic skinny. This aint it. It reminds me of nothing skinny has ever done, but everything of the late adventures both key and ohgr have done."
3,Disappointing,This is still a good album but not on par with any of the other Skinny Puppy Albums. The sound to me is more of a mix between the Ohgr solo stuff and the last Skinny Puppy album the Process. It is a lot poppier sounding than any of their other albums.
2,skinny puppy no more,"this cd does not appeal at all to old sp fans like myself. it is techno-oriented and too rappy. where is the dark mood and brutal, distorted lyrics? save your money and buy something else instead, like mentallo & the fixer"
2,yawn,"i was rather skeptical when hearing they were coming out with a new record,... as I am with most bands that take an extended hiatus. i was not wrong to be precautious it appears. i should mention that im one of those music listeners that everyone hates. the kind that if it doesnt grab me on the first few times through i get rid of it. I tried to resist the urge to do so with this record but caved in the end.while there are some interesting techniques taking place in most of the songs, it is not the record it should have been. i know that times change and you must adapt musically.had i been producing this record i would have sent them home with the entire catalogs of warp, schematic, merck, and some stuff from the german imprint hymen told them to come back in a month and we'll get busy working on the record.industrial is dead. move on."
1,Remission,"Skinny Puppy's existence is now truly bound in remission. What is left behind is a collection of ""nu-metal"" material. People will automatically respond with either one or both of the following:a) You are stuck in the 80's and cannot appreciate musical evolutionorb) You are not a true puppy fan.""Bites"" was the first Puppy item I ever had the pleasure of listening to. Even to this day I am enthralled by its brilliance. With the addition of Dwayne the puppy landscape expanded beyond comprehension. I cannot say brilliant enough. Nivek and Cevin now find themselves back at the beginning--without Dwayne. Possibly.. Bill Leeb [William Schroeder] possessed a certain something to make ""Bites"" so tasty, but all that is needed to dissolve that option is one listen to ""Brap."" No where on this disc are the multiple layers, thrash, or synthetic treachery that would strike a continual smile on my face...To regain that smile I will stick to Puppy's back catalogue... untarnished.r.i.p. dwayne :*("
1,One word: PATHETIC,"I would expect a little more from Ogre than this garbage he's passing off now. This is the worst album, not only in the Skinny Puppy catalog, but in the entire genre of the now deceased Industrial. This is a really bad album.Very bad. So bad in fact, in stinks."
5,A long time SP fan says...,"...I love it.And I've been a fan since I won a copy of Cleanse, Fold, and Manipulate from my college radio station in, I think, 87.I was so excited when I heard a new album was out and I'm not disappointed.All the other reviewers are correct in that it is definately an evolutionary step. Ogre sings more than he barks and the production is very polished. If you want to go back to VIVIsectVI days then you won't like this.The first few songs are fantastic and the openeing with I'mmortal kicks ass. I think it slows down in the middle but closed with two GREAT songs. I keep listening to Goneja and Daddyuwarbash over and over and over.Great effort. I hope I get to catch the next round of the tour in the US."
5,Truly a great skinny puppy album,"Skinny Puppy's newest album Greater Wrong of the Right is definetly one worth spending money on. While it's not the best album if you're just trying to get into them (I'd suggest either Too Dark Park or 12inch Anthology) it's still excellent; cEvin and Ogre haven't lost anything in the years that skinny puppy was disbanded. GWotR has taken them in a slightly different direction however, away from ogre's more harsh, aggresive vocals into something a little more structured. Not that that's a bad thing, the end product is amazing. Buy the album today and listen to it a couple times-- if you don't like it immediately i'll bet anything it will end up growing on you."
2,Ignore the butt-licking,"Skinny Puppy fans tend to be a bit rabid (no pun intended) and most of these reviews reflect this. Now, if Bill Leeb had released this album (and given the ""gay bar"" type music on here, he could have), these same people would be bashing the album.I love Puppy. I love ohGr, and I own the disks for most of cEvin's solo stuff. Given all of that, you'd think I'd love this album, but no.If the Puppy's intent here was to go mainstream and sell more albums, more power to them. They've given us some incredible music and they deserve to live well. This album is very accessible ... but also very boring.If you like Front Line Assembly, you'll dig this album."
1,Sunny Poppy,"If you like pop music, this CD is excellent. If you like industrial music, listen to pre-Process stuff, Neubauten (any area) or VAC (any area).There is nothing shocking/new/experimental on this CD, only some adult nice electro/dance/pop songs. Not bad, just very very sad."
1,"""Greater Wrong of The Right"" is all wrong.","Skinny Puppy is dead and now there is no question of that.""The Process"" was not a Puppy album and neither is this.This album is a sick joke and Ogre and Key should ashamed of themselves.Rest in peace Dwayne. We miss you."
3,It's not that this is bad...,"...Just I fail to see how SP fans can give it 5 stars. The songs are ""okay"" but certainly not as gritty and awe-inspiring as say, ViviSect, or even more recent material. There are still some fantastic moments on the disc and certainly it's much better than most of the other crap out there. I miss Ogre's rough growling voice (he sings way too much here) and if you saw them on tour this past year, these songs sound MUCH BETTER live (downSizer in particular). Musically, this is more towards ""The Process""-style ebm as opposed to classic Puppy experimentations. For me, that becomes a bit boring after two or three tracks."
3,what was that?,"I, as many of the other SP fans out there have been waiting for a very long time to get a hold of some newer music from the Key/Ogre combo. Normally, one could appreciate *atleast* the creative aspects behind anything either of them would do. However, this is not one of them.After hearing the album, I was semi-digusted. Using the name ""Skinny Puppy"" for this album hardly even seemed right. Track after track passed and all that came to mind was how much it sounded like a Download/Tear Garden album, rather than a SP one. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, I have let the CD spin on a few occasions, trying to gauge it for different moods/attitudes, and something always just doesn't connect with it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a *bad* album, it just doesn't click with me.Bottomline: If you enjoy Download/Tear Garden, go for it. Pick this album up. Me, I'll stay with my earlier collection. Brap on!"
5,skinny puppy will always be my favorate...,"I've been listening to skinny puppy since ""Mind"" I don't listen to them every day or anything like that. But here you are talking about a band that set an entire sound of their own in electronic music. I've seen so many bands that have followed their sound like there was a skinny puppy text book...They have skinny puppy loop tracks you can even buy...I think their new cd sounded awesome...in its own way. and that is what skinny puppy has been known for...doing it their own way...and not following what people tell them to sound like. Its not always the most important to be the most hardcore/most original/most pretentious...sometimes it's just worth doing what you want..."
3,What happened???,"Alright -- don't get me wrong. I'm a HUGE Skinny Puppy fan. I own every single one of their albums, singles, and compilations. For those of you who are new to Skinny Puppy, I strongly suggest checking out Bites, Too Dark Park, and Last Rights. This is NOT Skinny Puppy. Obviously, DR Goettel isn't present, and the album also lacks some old standards like the Green Man and Dave Ogilve. This album just doesn't have the dark ambiance of much of their earlier work. It isn't a total failure, however; tracks like Goneja and Daddyuwarbash show off Orge's vocal acrobatics and Key's sampling abilities. Unfortunately, most of the album sounds a little on the uninspired side, and you can almost hear Orge's desire to get back to the way things were on several of the tracks. The only thing that gets me to rest easier is the fact that bands like Wumpscut, Haujobb, and Einsturzende Neubauten are still producing quality industrial. Skinny Puppy just seems to have forgotten their roots."
5,isn't it clear?,i think the heavily opinionated nature of these reviews says more than the actual reviews.
3,great but not SP,"If you like OhGr you'll like this album. In terms of labeling it Skinny Puppy I dont understand. Every Puppy album has had a power and ferocity to them that this material just does not have. The music in itself is like nothing you have ever heard before and is excellent, but what is with the vocals? They sound almost high schoolish. Listen to the Process and then put this on right after. I dont get it. And Im not sure exaclty what Cevin brought to this but the music on here is no different then what Ogre has done on his last two OhGr's.I was expecting this to be a huge departure from both old Puppy and OhGr."
4,hard and heavy,"this stuff is true industrial.its cool.its hard.its heavy.its as hardcore,weirdo,freaky industrial as you get.only buy it if ur expecting hard stuff.only buy it if ur a industrial hardcore fan.pop people would not appreciate it.i do tho.its awesome!"
1,Another Death in the Industrial Era. R.I.P. S.P.,This was a real shocker when i got the cd about three weeks ago thank to a online buddy. But I really tried to give the album a chance only daddyuwarbash whatever song that was decent but the rest sorry. They had almost 10 years to write stuff and it comes down to this. A Shame. But with this album I say this should be the final straw and hang up the synths and Vocador and call it the final nail in the coffin. The songs were too over here and over there it was not like the dark elements and the dark vocals and harsh lyrics just a sold out industrial band. Thank You SYNTHSPOP for making this all possible. I will stick to my New Wave Bands and CDS. Industrial is dead!
3,"Not bad, but not reallly Puppy","I have mixed feelings about this CD. It is okay pop industrial; BUT, it really isn't what I expected from SP. The beats are old/tired and over-used...Why did they use such raggedy rhythm?I could wax nostalgic about old SP releases; however, I realize that bands do change. It is unfortunate that SP went this way. Feh.I definitely do not recommend it for die-hard SP fans, but do recommend it for people who like a more pop-like version of industrial. Buy TDP, Bites, Remission, Brap or Process for really fine SP.See? Mixed feelings!"
2,Linkin Puppy,"Yeah, I bet that hurts to those who might be fans (as am I, sigh), those two words, but they adequately describe the sound of Greater Wrong. It has some nice points (the last song wins in my book for best use of a Hindi movie sample; every other application of such sound had always come off as annoying as hell, no offense to Bolloywood fans (that and industrial, hmm...)), but overall, it feels like a big flop. I'm not ragingly advocating SP to keep up their old school sound, but in wake of new technology available these days, you'd hope they'd expand upon it. No, we just get some, as one reviewer put it, politically laced nu-metal. Check out older Puppy, please.And enough of the song title puns, gah."
2,Not that good...,"I never really did enjoy Skinny Puppy's sound, but upon buying ""TGWOTR"", this sound is barely tolerable. Think of Linkin Park, but not at MTV-friendly.The grittiness and in-your-face of SP is not present. They seemed to have toned down their sound to meet the standards of the mass majority which feeds upon garbage like Nu-Metal, Pop-Punk, and most of all RAP.""Pro-Test"" and ""Daddyuwarbash"". Literally the only two songs I like off the whole 10-track album.Get anything else from their catalogue of albums. Try something more even, like Ogre's or cEvin Key's side project. Don't bother with this new effort from SP."
1,The Greater Wrong of Skinny Puppy,"Skinny Puppy used to stand for something and that something was loud, harsh, messy, brain damaging, and bloody. But that something got lost on ""Greater Wrong of the Right"". Perhaps our beloved Pups needed some money and that's why they released an album under the Skinny Puppy name. Sorry, but that's good enough. Ogre and Cevin worked together on the Ohgr project and on Cevin's solo album and that's where it should have stopped. To call this CD Skinny Puppy is a tragic falsehood. Ogre lost his edge and his voice and Key fell in love with himself all over again. Call me nostalgic, but I just don't dig this new, rehashed garbage that people now pass off as industrial music and I'm very sad that Skinny Puppy, the originators of murderous noise pollution, now do."
3,good as what it is- but not really Puppy.,"Just because the 'age of industrial' has 'come to a close' doesn't mean that fans of the earlier Puppy releases have to like it.As much as I appreciate the thought that went into this album, and the idea that 'branching out' into new genres is good for the band, the sound seems to have lost much of what made it so attractive to many in the first place. Even the trademarked vocals are subdued, and the music is trance-y and poppish in many places.GWotR is a decent, well-composed album of what it is- not industrial. For the sake of those who enjoy that kind of thing, I hope that Puppy continues making albums of the same vein for a few more years.As for me, however? I'll stick with VIVIsectVI and Too Dark Park."
3,Their Back!,"Yay! Skinny Puppy is BACK! Ok. Some of you are going... Skinny who? Think Nine Inch Nails, but angry and loud...The album is industrial electronic sticky goodness. I think I was a junior in high school when I first heard of Skinny Puppy. I snuck into Numbers (a club in Houston) with friends and a fake id, eyeliner and safety pinned shredded jeans. This is not their old stuff. It's Skinny Puppy-esque and damn good new music"
2,"ohGr, not Skinny P","To agree with a previous review, this is more of a new ohGr album than Skinny Puppy. It just sounds like lame techno and I feel quite disappointed. If you want Skinny Puppy, M:tPI or Bites is the way to go. This is poppy gothic garbage."
4,"SP waterd down, but I like it","I have no idea why this received such bad reviews. Yes, it is Skinny Puppy watered down. It's not nearly as hard and in-your-face as their older stuff, but I still like the album for what it is. It's great music, instrumentation, vocals (though he's not distorting them) and lyrics. In comparison to their other albums, its feel is much like that of `The Process'. I don't expect SP to put out another album like `Last Rights' because I think they're in a different place in their lives now. I guess I expected an album like this so I didn't set myself up for disappointment.On a side note, it was absolutely awesome to see them perform this album live."
1,A comic without pictures,"I found Young Cruisers, banal, a travesty of the English language. The stories are totally predictable, the English terrible, a total lack of grammer and syntax.The book does nothing for the causes of homosexuality, it is raw sex in its most basic form. Each of these stories has the capability to be turned into something more beautiful, but instead is left like graffiti on a toilet wall. If there was a zero star rating, that would get my vote."
5,Great double boiler for making yogurt,"We use this double boiler exclusively for making yogurt. You can bring the milk up to temperature without worrying about scorching or boiling too quickly.The quality is high. It has a clear lid so you can see what is going on without removing it. It has a small hole in the lid to relief the pressure evenly.Altogether, this is a great double boiler for making yogurt."
2,Having problems with some episodes,"To begin, I'm a big fan of this series & was glad it was finally made available on DVD. Now to the bad part: Disc 3 will not play at all using Windows Media Player -- I get an error message stating that I may need to add another driver (funny that the other discs don't require this ""new driver""). Additionally, at least one episode on the other four discs is pixilated & the sound is terrible."
2,Wonder Why?,"On disc 2 they've completely changed a song. Sounds trivial, I know, but when Ray walks into the diner to find everybody dead, coffee still hot, jukebox playing Gale Garnett's We'll Sing In The Sunshine, it was eerie as heck! They've put some random (my guess is made-up) song on instead. I know I'm not remembering it incorrectly because I checked on the VIDEO I'd made from the television. It takes away from an important scene and seems like a lame thing to do. Does anyone have any idea why they'd do this? I'm curious. ALSO disc 1 kept cutting out with the message "" skipping over damaged area"". A bit weird considering it was right out of the box and on it's first play. Ray is still cool, though!"
4,Who is this man?,"To be honest I thought I'd remember all the shows from the 80's but this one seem to pass by me. I got this one on a whim and checked it out and became a fan. The most exciting part of the show was the fact nobody really knew who ""Ray"" was. He seemed to be a drifter who just wanted to help people and solve cases. And here's the kicker, he'd do it not for money but for a favor, (sounds like the Godfather, right?) All in all it was a good show and I'm glad I saw it."
3,Nick Mancuso!!!,"I bought the ""bootleg"" DVD set several years ago... I may just have to get this ""official"" one and see how they compare. The dude that was selling the set I bought had a great price for about 9 disks but no extras...Now to check if his Matrix TV show is here yet..."
3,Erinnerungen werden wach ...,"Super Serie und auch sehr schnell geliefert. Leider ist die erste DVD nicht in Ordnung und kann nur zur Hälfte über den DVD Player abgespielt werden, die zweite Hälfte lässt sich nur über den Laptop abspielen.Der Serie ansich tut es aber keinen Abbruch."
2,broke my heart,"i recieved the dvds and got all of it and was very nice and no problem but one. i am deaf and have no way of knowing what is said as it not close caption or have subtitiles so i am unable to enjoy it. it broke my heart because i so wanted it and when it was on t.v i work nights then and did not have a way to recored it.oh... it sadden me that they will not do dvds with close captions or subtitles.nor do they show if it is close caption or subtitles, so i spend when not knowing if it is or not. sorry to be a pain but that is sad"
4,Really liked the series.,I was a fan of this short lived series. To see it available on video was great. I look forward to finding the time to watch the series from beginning to end.
5,An old favorite to finally enjoy again.,"This was my favorite of the 80's action series, even though it was short-lived. Haven't seen any episodes since the original run. Dvds are well mastered, no sloppy audio. This series had such a fantastic main character/lead actor, and there was so much potential. Glad I finally own this and can enjoy what once was."
4,Stingray TV Series,"It's great to find this on DVD, I enjoyed it when it was on tv, now I have my own."
3,Stingray,"Stingray had potential in that it is quite a fascinating idea this mysterious, enigmatic man. The trouble is the movies are too flashy. The stories do get better as they go along."
4,Disgusting Packaging on a Great Series,The series is great. But what do we have to do to get the idiots that design packaging like these fired (or at least severely reprimanded)? Paper envelopes stacked in the center of the box? Have some consideration for the customers that keep you as studios in business.
4,"Great movie, must see!","Harry Lesser (Dylan McDermott), is a statutory tenant who writes on the top floor of an abandoned building, writing a novel which is taking him 10 years to complete. Willie Spearmint (Snopp Dogg), is a reloutionist writer who moves into the building, uninvited, to write his book as well. The movie is slow at some points, but having you wonder what will happen next. I can watch the movie again and again."
2,What the hell is going on????,I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It went from one dead end to another. If you are into seeing people get dogged out then this is the movie for you. Snoop's character really got on my nerves. I almost wanted to turn it off. But I watched to end. What the ????
3,Artist receives no royalties from this album.,"This is Billy Vera. Although this is a pretty good album of mine, from 1976, I receive no royalties, either as the singer or songwriter from it. I will leave it to the conscience of my fans as to whether you wish to support a company that does not pay the artist.Sincerely,Billy Vera"
2,Micro Vault 128 on WinXP & Win2K,"The Sony Micro Vault 128 is not recognized by Windows. Even on a fully patched OS including the current BIOS. The Micro Vaultlocks up the machine when there is another USB device present.The worst part is that Sony's Customer Support line was incapable of solving the problem and requires that the end-userobtain a refund from the merchant. I spent in excess of 2 hours with Sony representatives with the end result being ""You must use the root hub ports on the back of the Systems Unit"". For a USB device, this is impracticle. In addition, the Sony Help Line did not even know how to support the product. I was transferred 5 times or had to re-dial another support group.Sony products are not of the same quality they were a few years ago!"
4,Truth in advertising?,"The large print on the front of the box says, ""No driver software needed"".The fine print in the instructions states, ""Installing the device driver"".There are 8 steps to installing the device driver and steps 3 through 7 must be repeated three times. If you don't have a CD drive that can accommodate a small (nonstandard) CD you must download the driver from Sony.Granted, this hassle is probably Microsoft's making and not Sony's. The installation is straight forward and once the installation is complete, the MicroVault is a great product right down to the sci-fi glow of the green activation LED - BUT -a device driver is required for Windows 98/98SE."
2,The glue they use is terrible,"The glue they use to put this thing together is terrible. I have had two that have come apart. It's very annoying. The drive works fine, but you can't use it very easily when both ends pull apart. I would not buy another Sony Micro Vault."
3,Don't pay $50 for this camera,"My main point in writing this review is that you can get this camera for much, much cheaper by buying it used or elsewhere.The Holga is fun and I know many people who swear by it. While I personally have never been extremely into lomography/""plastic fantastic"" cameras, if you are this is a good camera and the advantage of using medium format film is wonderful. Also there are scores of websites that will tell you all the ways you can modify your Holga. So have fun! But seriously, there's almost no reason why not to buy this item used. I would not pay more than $20 for it."
2,not quite what I expected,"I recently bought this camera but couldn't manage to get it working yet because I couldn't figure out how to put the film in it. there is no instructions or users manual or nothing inside the package, so I'm left on my own to figure out everything.my first thoughts when I opened up the package was that it is quite huge and doesn't look elegant at all. very basic simple design and material. compared to the previous semi-disposable lomo's i've used this seems really big for the job.the film size is also different (bigger) than the regular standard films. my previous lomo worked with any standard film, so I don't know yet if this can pose a problem.on the other hand, this camera has all the features you need.final verdict: doesn't worth the price nor the big size"
4,A Good but Misnamed Book,"This book is obviously well-researched, though I think that more information on other parts of Ohio could have been included as well. It's obvious that the author concentrated on his area of Ohio. I would love to see a few sequels to this book; I'd buy them! However, my biggest complaint is the title--it is *very* misleading. I expected stories of *haunted* places in Ohio--and only a couple of ghosts are alluded to. Actually calling it Ghost Towns: Ohio's Lost Landscapes and Forgotten Places or something like that would have been better, I think."
2,Description didn't match the book,"Thsi book had an interesting premise, but it was a lot of rambling, very little information on the ghost towns, and a bit of a disappointment. I didn't finish it, donated it to the Kidney Foundation after a few chapters."
2,"Lots of Power, but there is better out there..","Seems to have lots of Power...but just straight vibration, No pulsating modes...It has been rated as just OK...but its at the bottom.Sorry."
1,Don't waste your time!!!!!!,"Not worth buying!!!! Not worth 1 star. The best vibrator so far is the magic wand, nothing else beats it or comes close."
2,Ouch,"The hard edges on the outside of this product hurt. Budily fluids tend to get trapped inside the textured cap (which is also made out of uncomfortably hard plastic. Also it's noisier than any other vibe I own. Not recommended, there are a lot better vibes out there."
4,Powerful.,One powerful little toy. Maybe a little too powerful. Waiting for battery to run down a bit. First time out my girlfriend went from zero to happy ending in about 3 1/2 minutes.
4,A good thing for headaches.,"In a weird reversal of earlier euphamistic advertisements, this item is actually used around here to help relieve sinus and migraine pain.Vibrators don't otherwise do it for me, so I don't think I can honestly review this item for its original use.But it will take out temple pain, and help drain blocked sinuses, and it can really rev up a good sneezing fit, clean the head right out.Hm. So I guess it does do what it was designed to do -- just on the other end."
5,My mother is very happy,Well i got this for my mom after she told me my step dad was not stepping up to the plate. Well this litle thing hit a home run. She is busting nuts left and right now. Great product.
3,"Ok, but not one of her best.","This was a good read when there's nothing better to do.It's a minor point, but I could never figure out how or why her brother got a Maltese from China. The Maltese is a european dog (Malta), what was one doing in China in the 1800's?"
3,Cute beginning...,"I felt the book started off sweet but it started getting ridiculous towards the end. Without disclosing much, I don't understand why Josh wanted a mail order bride. His current situation wasn't permanent! Were his intentions to divorce this mail order bride in a year? His true identity was too much for me. I realize it's just a story, but it was too sappy for me. I would not recommend this one.. too many good books out there that are truly worth the time and money."
1,What a Dissapointment!!!,"This book started off great. I invested a lot of time and emotion in most of the book. I loved the characters and got really involved and read the book in two days.The last 5 chapters were slapped on the book. There was no thought put into these last chapters. There was no climax; no big secret. The end of the book was so abrupt, I couldn't believe it! It had such potential and then totally flopped. I wish I had never read it because I invested so much in the story and the characters only to be let down harshly.Don't bother. This book was such a waste of time and emotion."
1,dumb dumb dumb,This is the dumbest book I have ever read by this author. I was so dissapointed with the whole thing. I thought Josh's secret was really going to be something. Wrong. Dont waste your tiome on this book. I will stick with Jennifer Crusie and Janet Evanovich. They know how to tell a really good story.
3,Not one of her best,"Very readable, but this is not one of Jude's best stories. I believe I paid about $2.00 for this, and it is certainly not worth more than that."
4,A good read,it is a good read about the world of yeaterday when thing were a lot less in such a mess
4,You write your own story,I enjoyed thus book and felt like I was transported to the town of Eternity. The auther Jude Deveraux really brings her stories to life.
3,this one is ok only for me...,"well not one of my favorites but it was ok,Carrie Montgomery, the baby of the rich Montgomery family,the youngest and only girl,with seven older brothers,very protected of her... Joshua Greene,poor with two adorable kids... its a cute love story,but it could have been better,not one of her best... but if your like me who is very interested in the Montgomery family,this is one of them so,read it if you want..."
5,Backwards fairy tale: Princess rescues pauper,"Rich East Coast girl rescues a depressed and impoverished Western farmer and his two children. She boosts the local economy by hiring other people to paint his disintegrating shack. She furnishes the house, dresses up the children and hires someone to cook good meals. She doesn't do the work herself - she does what she knows, which is spend money. It is a backward fairy tale: the princess rescues the pauper. It's whipped cream, but it tastes delicious."
3,"Cute, but...","I thought that this was a cute story. I felt like it was written just to meet a deadline, though. There really wasn't much substance to this. My favorite parts of the whole book were the scenes with 'Ring. I think that I have already read the best of Jude, because lately the books I have been reading have been a far cry from AKISA and Remembrance. Knowing that she can write books like those, this is a disappointment, along with the last few books I reviewed. Though the story was cute, and Carrie was absolutely adorable, it is a pretty forgetable book. Sorry!"
2,This sucked!,"Believe me, Jude Deveraux could have done better. I love her books but this one was really annoying and boring. I kept hoping that something exciting might happen. She made 'Ring sound like an invalid. The mystery of Joshua Greene was really nothing"
4,an eastern mind understands jesus' mission,this book was not an easy read for a lay young person but i am glad i still read it. reading this book made realize how little as christians we hear what 'others' are saying. the authour overcomes the listening problem and uses what the three theologians are saying to clarify and crytalize for us the mission of jesus to the world. an excellent book to read to understand the uniquieness of jesus and his message in our pluralistic society.
3,Neat but Flawed,"FOR - Lightweight, attractive to look at and without the numerous unnecessary functions that many gadgets come with.AGAINST - miscalculates urban times and distances due to loss of GPS signal-screen difficult to read-controls awkward when worn-Navman do not reply to requests for advice/information not included in the manual"
5,Great for IPA,I recently purchased this book for my college diction courses I am required to take as a music performance major. This book is fantastic for anyone looking for a good French IPA dictionary. I am incredibly happy with this purchase and just bought the Larousse German-English dictionary for the same purpose.
4,I was suprised,I was pretty impress with this album because latley the westcoast has been in a slump but El Demonio kinda brings it back with that sound that the westcoast has been missing latley. Its some Westside funk definitley. Good album.
5,My favorite reference book,"If you, like me, don't have the money or the space to add the full OED to your reference collection, this is the next best thing."
4,Sony Hi8 Camcorder cassette,These work great and the color is also good. I will buy again when needed
1,Not Hi-8 tapes,Be careful! I ordered 3 4-packs. Thought they were Hi-8 tapes but received standard 8mm ones.
5,Sony 120 Minute Hi8 Video 8mm Tape (4-Pack),arrived in excellant shape have not taken any new video yet but will in the near future I will share these tapes with other family members who have Sony 360 video camcorders since everything has now gone digital and it is hard to find 8mm tapes
2,ok,This is an OK purchase that seems to have done what we wanted it to do for us and hopefully will continue.
1,Shipping Message is a Joke! Ordered 8 days back!,It seems Amazon.com service is getting poorer day by day. The product page displays it will ship in 1-2 days. I've placed order for this item more than 8 days back. I got email today from Amazon saying it will take another 20 days. This site is becoming CHEAP and UNRELIABLE site. To top all this you cannot talk to anybody. You can send only email. Usually I've seen retailers throwing some goodies when they make mistake. Amazon guys simply send you one email saying they are cancelling your order.
5,Book The Sixth Winter,"I rate this book a 5, but it's a treasure of mine and my copy had died. A thriller to read and as it happens has become a truth a global changes effect our lives. Well worth a read Ann"
1,Do not buy this item. I did and was sorry. Be warned,I purchased this circle of love item from szul which shipped late. When it arrived it was not as advertised. you could not even see the diamonds to the naked eye. It was also much smaller than advertised. When I went to return it they charged me a $18 restocking fee which is contrary to their money back guarantee. Don't believe or trust them. My CC company returned the difference because they found szul in the wrong. Don't be fooled. Be warned instead.
3,Classic '60s Basie,"This is an example of Basie's band in the late 1950/early 1960 era, with arrangements by Neil Hefti. Pleasant listening but nothing memorable."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased 5 of these ""little"" clamps because they were cheap and I needed more little clamps.They work good but are very cheaply made. The weak spot seems to be where the handle attaches to the clamp as I have managed to break two handles already. ...But as I am woodworker I madified the handles and they work great now.For the price these are what you woudl expect, if you want perfect clamps of this style that will last for years - these are not them."
5,Beginners guide for serious glass painters only,"This book describes in detail the materials and techniques used in traditional kiln-fired glass painting techniques. The second edition (which I acquired) has updated material source listings (i.e. where to buy the paints, tools, etc.) and includes URLs which would have been missing from the original. If you ever wanted to make stained glass paintings like you saw in church as a child, this will show you how.Note that this is a book on kiln-fired glass paints, and as such is not targeted towards those who want to be able to paint glass with resources commonly available around the house. Those looking to do crafsty glass painting should look for a different book on the subject."
5,The Art of Painting on Glass,I was amazed and pleased at how fast we received the book we ordered. The condition of the book was exactly like described. I was very pleased with the seller. Thank you so much!!
5,Not your usual kids' CD,I love the fact that none of these songs is on any other CD that my kids listen to. We love Tina's singing so much that we usually skip the instrumental part--they would rather sing along with her than by themselves. It is our favorite family CD.
4,Imagine Dylan and a Young Van Morrison,"For over 20 years Ian Charles has done it the old fashined way, through touring the East Coast area all the way to his sold out Wishing Street tour with over 400 dates nationwide!This roots based artist has stayed true to the vision of alternitive Americana music with his heart and soul..A stunning live performer,smart enough to utilize modern music technology today..he brilliantly combines smart folk music with powerfull singing and a wow stage presence...similar to an early Van morrison..Be sure to catch his upcoming regional tour with his new band Little Victories !"
2,No easy way to retrieve needles,It's very difficult to pick up the needles from the flat magnetic surface especially without long fingernails. I always dread the slow-down in my work and the momentary frustration when it comes time to try and dig a needle out of this box. There are other designs that make a needle far easier to retrieve and even an old-fashioned pin cushion seems like a far more practical idea.
5,You Need This Book,"It will clear your thinking wonderfully, with its sharp, logical explanation of the proper uses of the law, what constitutes a misuse of the law, and the causes of abuses of the law. The concept of plunder, taking what belongs to someone else, is central to The Law; it's posited early that there are two ways of surviving and gaining wealth, work and plunder. Plunder is easier than work unless there's an external restraint on plunder. But the power used to stop plunder can also be used to commit it.If only more people read it, we might be more like the America of Bastiat's day, which he admired. Bastiat noted there were only two areas in which America fell short of the classical liberal ideal, and warned that those two might be the undoing of American liberty. Those two were protectionism and slavery, the very things that led to secession, which led to the Civil War and the loss of liberty war, especially civil war, always brings."
5,"Bastiat's ""The Law""","This is an excellent essay on the role of government as it relates to private property and individual liberty. Although written long ago, it's especially applicable to our times, with continuing expansion of government."
4,Sound beliefs with some humor,"This book helped me develop another perspective on the law, what it is , can be, and most importantly should be restrained to remaining. Law is a basic and equal Justice for all. It does not meddle in affairs is does not naturally contain. It is not a tool to force conformity. It is not a science experiment for the would be omnipotent legislator.Law is organized justice which defends life, property, and liberty.The knowledge in this book far exceeds the .99 cent price tag.I would recommend this to anyone, especially the individuals making our laws."
3,a little different,"Considering this was written over 100 years ago, I was thinking it could be applied today - a just system of laws and then demonstrates how such law facilitates a free society. Well worth the 99 cents!"
3,Too many typographical errors,"The large number of typographical errors made reading this short book quite irritating. The publisher needs to proof-read the text before publishing. Otherwise, this is an excellent treatise on the perversion of law in society."
1,"Not like Bastiat`s ""Petition""","Badly fundamented and without the humor of classic Bastiat texts like the ""Petition from the manufacturers of candles"", this text disappointed me.But the worst was to read the introduction, by a Loyola Colege professor. This ""member of the Mises Institute"" was so eager to defend the status quo, that he put aside definitions of liberty like the one proposed by Hayek - much closer to von Mises - in his ""Constitution of Liberty"":""(...) freedom does mean and can mean only that what we may do is not dependent on the approval of any person or authority and is limited only by the same abstract rules that apply equally to all.""This is far from saying that all that comes from the state is evil, as the praface's autor is eager to conclude. He should try John Rawls for a better view of equality of oportunity."
2,THE GREETER,"THIS BOOK CAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY TALK SHOW HOST AND I PURCHASED THE BOOK . THE FORWARD WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND I LOOKED FORWARD TO THE READ . WELL , I HAVE TRIED TO READ THE BOOK , BUT HAVE PUT IT DOWN FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF MY DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE AUTHOR'S 1850 STYLE OF WRITING . IT'S PROBABLY JUST ME AND I'LL TRY AGAIN AT A LATER DATE ."
3,Public Domain,"Note that this work is in the public domain, and that fairly handsome PDF editions are freely available online (as well as audio readings, for those so inclined.)"
5,This should be required reading on Tax Day.,"This is a quick read, but as the Bard observed, ""Brevity is the soul of wit."" This should be required reading for anyone who pays one cent or more in taxes. Considering Tax Freedom Day was June 20th this year, the need is urgent.Bastiat is a French word that means ""Adam Smith."" You would swear that he was part of the Scottish Enlightenment, along with our Founding Fathers. Indeed, he makes the Libertarians look like Vladimir Lenin.One of his ideas that is still ringing harmoniously in my ears is the ideas of government compassion. Bastiat observes that in the name of compassion, governments can and will do anything with peoples money. But is that really compassion?Read this along with Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America."""
5,Life Liberty and Property,"If you believe,as did John Locke, that everyone is entitled to Life Liberty and Property (not the pursuit of happiness as Jeffeson changed it) then you should read this phamplet.Gunner September, 2007"
5,Necessary Reading,"This short book could practically serve as a tract in favor of libertarianism and classic liberalism (the latter not to be confused with the modern socialist ""liberalism"" of the U.S. Democrat Party). I heartily recommend it, and further recommend that in consideration of its low price the reader consider buying a couple of extra copies to give to coworkers, friends or family that also long for liberty."
5,A Book To Make You Think,"THis is a great book to stimulate ""the little grey cells."" Even though it was written in the mid 1800's, the logic applies today.Enjoy!"
5,The true purpose of government,The truth never changes. As relevant today as the day it was written. It will remind you of what the true purpose of law and government is. It will remind you of what our founding fathers intended when they wrote the constitution.
5,First Rate,"This is a must read. I would like to see a copy of this book in the hands of every law maker in the country. So simple and so true. When I first read it at age 16, I purchased multiple copies to give away. As soon as I get back on my feet in this economy, I plan to do so again. LONG LIVE FREEDOM!"
4,I wish this were taught in our schools.,This should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves an American patriot. We have a long way to go.
4,"buy it for your friends, buy it for complete strangers","It really is an exceptional book, and although it has been translated, there is no question to the opinions the author offers. One segment, about how before the income tax and before most of the taxes we know today, communities came together to solve local issues. Now, with many people taxed 30% or more depending on your status, we seperate and stay(cower) in our homes and expect the governments to solve the important issues of the day.I said no mas to taxes in 2004. Mostly because of the occupation of Iraq. The tax professionals recommend paying your taxes at the end of the year as opposed to every paycheck, and so as an experiment, I claimed 10 on my w-4 instead of the usual 1. I paid only social sec and medicare taxes, and I had to give away alot of money. In the end, I still owed about $1000, but it felt good. I encourage you to do this at least once."
1,LOOK AT THE PICTURE CLOSELY---BOTTOM LEFT,"This product says in the lower left hand corner--Model #10CRM80The product information say's it is Model #10CRM80L2//T --- There is a lot of differance between the two, don""t let them tell You any different!!!BUYER ""BEWARE"" I bought this from Efunctional--Strange that this ""SAME AUDIO CD-R""has the same Picture and wrong model Numbers, also. DOES ANYONE REALLY CARRY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,"Book Beautiful HOWEVER, ABSURB PRICE INCREASE","The price of this book DOUBLED since I placed it in my ""cart"" last week. Today is 10/2/12. It is an insult to have such an increase in the price. It is simply ""price gouging"" and greed at it worse. Absolutely an insult. A small increase, okay. but to DOUBLE the price from one week to the next...is offensive."
2,Heard it all before,"This book is nothing new. I suppose the information would be entertaining if it was the first book I read on the subject, or if I believed it. A lot of the explanations and revelations seem VERY similar to Sylvia Browne's, who was the first to write about the subject of ""the holding place"", ""dark entities"", and our charts, or blueprints we make before coming into life.What Sylvia says works and makes sense, and I see a lot of psychic authors jumping on the Sylvia bandwagon. If all this is true, why wasn't it all revealed 10, 20, or 60 years ago? Why now all of the sudden?Anyway, this book is very comforting to read, and nice to believe in, although it just doesn't ring true to me."
3,Very good album,This is a very good album by this nice Brazilian band. Their beat is incredible and the lyrics are also good. I recommend this album to the people who wants to add some of the brazilian beat to their collection.
3,Good introduction to issues with urban development,"This is a good overview of urban issues in America. Having worked in the field of urban development for the past 30 years, I found it a bit elementary and expect that it is meant for high-school level analysis. The author clearly understands the issues and provides a list of books for further reading. Don't expect an in-depth analysis, but if you are interested in reading a summary of the issues resulting from urban development in the United States, this is a good introduction."
5,Mad Nice,"This album was off the hook! Every track is crazy. Watch out for this cat, he's definitely makin some real noise. Cop the album!!!!!!!!"
4,"Generally excellent, thorough","Overall this is a superb, detailed and thorough accounting of the development of Chinese civilization, correlating the effect of economic, technological, political and other forces. It is, however, dry reading -- not at all a popularized account. That's fine with me -- considering the scope of the work it would be a huge volume indeed if pages were wasted trying to make the content more 'colorful'. One specific criticism -- generally the 'bc' and 'ad' are left off dates -- this is irritating in periods where the author develops a point by skipping about in a span of a few hundreds of years and it isn't always easy to discern immediately what century is being discussed."
5,A Chinese Sheherazade,"Delightful collection of tales and fables by one of the most wrongfully-neglected English writers of the 20th Century. The itinerant storyteller Kai Lung, with the assistance of the delectable Hwa Mei, must circumvent the evil machinations of Ming Shu by providing a tale suited to each arising occasion. I first read this book in the early 70's, when Lin Carter reissued it in his Ballantine Fantasy series, and fell in love with its sparkling wit and originality. It is a source of considerable perplexity (to me, anyway) and some chagrin that Bramah continues in obscurity--as a writer, he is non-pareil. Someone must reissue these things (4 in the series, I believe). Fortunately, any good library will retain copies, but once you have read them you'll want copies of your own (to sleep with, under your pillow). Sweet dreams."
3,"Sorry, Kai Lung Fans, But I thought This Was Dreadful","I'm giving this a three star review, simply out of appreciation to the volunteers who made it available for free, but, otherwise would have given it a one.I am a massive Dorothy Sayers fan, and she begins so many of her book chapters with quotes from Kai Lung, that it became a must read for me, and I was delighted to find it on Kindle for free.I thought the book had aged dreadfully, and it came acrost as snide, and belittling to the Chinese, in that century old, ""it's OK to talk about the little yellow men this way"" kind of way. It was muddy, and difficult to read, with so many enforced, circular, repetitive politenesses and platitudes that it really did- literally -put me to sleep.I do like the Carrados series by the same author, but this one just didn't do it for me. Thanks for making it available, though. I do think that it is important that this old material isn't lost, and am relieved to find that others really enjoyed it."
4,A truly wonderful book,"...I've owned several hobby level photo manipulation programs in the past, but couldn't get past the learning curve on Photoshop. This is the book that gave me the reason to work on learning Photoshop again.Ms. Eismann provides copies of most of the sample photos on her Web site, so you can practice on the same files that she used in her book. I'm about a third through the book and I've just finished a large annual photo project that involved correcting about 75 pictures, mostly taken in very low light. This was the fastest I've ever done the project and the quality of the finished files is so much better than anything I've ever done before that I'm amazed. And yes, I did it in Photoshop."
5,Excellent book,"This is the Photoshop book I keep going back to. The title may lead you to think it's only for working with badly damaged photos, but that's not the case. It is for anyone wanting to edit photos. It covers the basics as well as advanced topics.The author does an excellent job of showing the steps needed for a particular task and also keeping it simple. She often shows several different ways to accomplish to same goal.This probably isn't a good first book if you've never worked with Photoshop at all. But once you get some basic familiarity with the software you will get a lot of mileage out of this book."
5,The ultimate reference source for retouching information.,"An incredibly useful, interesting, thorough, and informative book. Whether you intend to use the accompanying web resources or not, you will learn something new every time you pick up the book. For retouching old family photographs, this is the best book I have ever seen. It will help you retouch your heirloom whether your problem is fading, scratches, color-bleed, mold and other spots, or whatever else can go wrong with a picture, you'll be able to greatly improve it by following these step-by-step instructions."
2,This book reveals the emptiness of modern society,"There is very little poetry and very little meaning in the Great Gatsby. A child could very well have written it. I do not blame the author for this, since it only reflects our society. But characters such as Nick or Jay or Tom are superficial, empty, and provide no substance to the novel. The women in the novel, such as Daisy, Myrtle, and Jordan, are objects of mens' affections only, and demonstrate the sexism we all face. There should be some way to work around the disgusting limits of our society and once again write beautiful literature."
3,GATSBY,AH THE GREAT GATSBY THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE NOVEL IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHAT WE TODAY WOULD CALL A JERRY SPRINGER SHOW THIS NOVEL IS A NOVEL WITH A LOT OF SYMBOLISM IF YOU LOOK FOR IT BUT IF YOU DON'T IT'S STILL A VERY CLEVERLY WRITEN NOVEL. BECAUSE OF THE LOVE TRIANGLE AND THE MANY TWISTS AND TURNS I GAVE IT 3 STARS
3,This book was entertaning but confuseing to me.,"I think that this book was very exciting. I think that Daisy should have gotten a divorce from her husband because obviuosly he did not love her. This book made me wonder if Daisy and The Great Gatsby were going to hook up.That is what I wanted. Also, I did not really understand the book I think it was a little to old for me to really understand."
5,One Great Book,"Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is one of the greatest books ever written in the English language. Not only does it supply readers with detailed desciptions of social history (The Roaring '20s), but it serves as a brilliant satire on many facets of the ""American Dream"". The symbolism, character development, and amount of realism make Gatsby one of the best books I have ever read."
4,It was a very interesting book.........,"The Great Gatsby is a fascinating book to read. It contains several different types of characters-the selfish, the brutal, the ambitious, and even the reserved characters; all add a touch of intrigue to the book. Jay Gatsby's ambition in the book, gives us the amazing faith within us, that we can achieve anything, as long as we work hard for it. Yet, in the end, does working hard, and having all the materialistic goods in the world to own for yourself, make you a happy person?????"
3,the book is great,"The book is great because it demonstates that if we do not live in the present and hope for the future we will be doomed to make the mistakes of the past. However the nuetral style in which it is written leaves me to ponder if Fitzgerald should have been the one to write this. Maybe someone else could have done better with characters. Oh well, this is still worth reading. 3/5"
4,It's WNEW!,"Look I think the review Ricardo gives is superb..BUT! Look this is beautiful music that was for the period, 60's, very playable and got plenty of air time on such great NY stations as the uncomparable WNEW, and it filled a void that Percy faith did not. Composers like Valle' and Deodato were almost unheard of in the period this was released. I must admit that I bought the LP and consequently bought Valle'68 for that very reason..I knew the tune and loved the composer. So taken at face value, it sure makes for valuable vlistening time, but for the discriminating, it ain't Jobim..but it'll sure do.Listen to the wonderful druming on this one as well, Edson was one of my percussion ""heroes!"""
4,The Left and The Right,"This book is loaded with little known information about the labor relations in the United States and its impact upon people of color. Through conversations of the characters the reader learns how unions are organized, who benefits, who fears them and the risks both government workers and union-organizers face. The characters, like real people, deal with personal challenges as they do [or not do] their jobs. Office politics abound and the reader often feels as if he or she has worked for or with some of the characters."
2,Not all that good,"Too many reviews have stated that one has to be ""open-minded"" to appreciate this book, as if resenting all the sex makes one close-minded. This book is full of Farmer's sexual ideas, and if you don't agree with those, you won't like the book. Also, the story itself isn't all that great. The idea of The Nine is intriguing, but instead of making a couple of heroes of another age more ""real"", the story made them a lot weirder. Stick to Burroughs or Dent, and let Farmer spin his little fantasies to himself."
1,don't waste your money,This has to be one of the nastiest foulest books I haver ever tried to read. This guy is sick and has some real issues.I only read about 2 chapters and could not get the images out of my head.
4,passing the test of time,"I read this work by Farmer many years ago and decided to read it again. It has passed the test of time. At first glance, one may wonder if it is an imitation of Burroughs and Roberson. If one is a fan of Tarzan and Doc Savage, one soon realizes that it is a genuine tribute. Dramatic, fast moving, a bit extreme in places, it holds the reader. I strongly recommend it to all fans of these writers and characters."
5,Excellent Grammar and Word Choice Section,"I use the Grammar and Word Choice section of this book all the time. It has very easy definitions and examples of parts of speech and punctuation. There is a list of commonly misspelled words (properly spelled for you) and the appropriate usage of common confusing words (when to use affect vs effect, anticipate vs expect, discrete vs discreet, and so on). There is also a series of lists of correct abbreviations, for example, academic degrees, professional titles, latin abbreviations, and mailing and state abbreviations.I point out this section because it may not be evident that there would be such an excellent resource inside an online style guide. But this grammar section is so easy to reference and has very simple examples -- I use it ALL the time! I recommend you buy this book even if all you need it for is common day-to-day writing do's and don'ts."
2,now it's broken and worthless,"It worked for a couple of years, then a silly little plastic connecting piece from the vibrator to the blades broke off. I can't find a replacement, so now the whole thing is worthless. I suggest maybe fewer parts, but metal construction for the critical ones...."
1,Not the Newbery,"Ordered this to complete my Newbery collection. Even though it is posted in the group with being written by James Daugherty, it is not. Not worth my efforts to send it back, but this isn't the book it appears to be"
3,Perfect Assasins,"This movie is not the worst movie in the world but by no means the best either.If you like lots of action but not a strong plot then this is the movie for you.I liked certain parts of the movie,like Aaron Lohr's amazing performance as a brainwashed assasin.His performance was the best in the movie and he did'nt speak so that gives you an idea of the talent in this film.Portia da Rossi gave a horrible performance in her role,I don't know what she was thinking.Overall this movie is my type of movie,pure mind candy.If you are looking for an Oscar award winning quality type movie then this definitely is not for you."
1,Don't Even Think About Getting This BBC Video!,This was the worse BBC period drama I have ever seen (and I love BBC period dramas). Luckily I only spent $5.00 on the DVD since it was on sale and that was $5.00 too much! My wife and I didn't even get halfway through it before we turned it off and then threw it in the trash.
1,Rubbish,"I thought this was so bad that I cut up the DVD with scissors and threw it away. I didn't even want to give it to a charity shop.I knew the story line, but the way it was portrayed made me feel disgust. I can't quite think of the appropriate words but ""gratuituosly sexually perverse"" is about as close as I can get. It's the dead opposite of a ""feel good"" movie."
2,The book is so much better..though not sure how much is true,"I read the book first before seen either BBC or Hollywood movie. I have also read many other books on the subject of Anne Boleyn and the era. I was really disappoint with the movie. The many of the charactors would have ""Diary camera"" talk to explain thoughts. I always felt like I was watching Real World. The film had a very small budget and the customs/sets seem to be missing the glamor of Tudor look. I felt the script was missing important parts from the book. Mary grew up in France and her husband was chosen by King Henry VIII. She did not have just one child with Henry but two. Don't get me talking about hollywood movie...such a bad movie!! It's better to read the book and imagine their world. Both movies are not worth seeing."
2,Skip this version!,"I adore Natscha McElhone in ""Californication"" and was hoping this would be a fantastic movie but... I have to say, the rather revisionist pseudo-documentary portrayal was a bit out of place. Clearly, the director has talent and skill but it didn't add to the story for me - particularly the ""reality tv show"" style of having the sisters speak directly to the camera like they were in an episode of ""Regency House.""Was budget an issue? Hunting scenes without horses - just the king on a walk with his dogs? Huh? Overall a bit disjointed - not a lot of emotion and tremendous inconsistency in accents. Just not all that great overall. I really wanted to like it but... hey - at least we get to see Jodhi May's breasts, right?"
2,dissapointed,"I had read the book about 6 months ago, I thought it was one of the best books I had read in a long time...My mistake was reading the book first. If I would have known that they were making a movie I would never had read it. The movie was like a short intro to the book. They left out so, so much of the story. Whoever edited that movie should be shot. The rivalry between the sisters was so downplayed. The king being really hurt, getting fatter and uglyer. His real relation with the Queen, etc.I felt cheated."
2,Awful video quality -- Looks bootlegged,"If I hadn't bought this directly from Amazon, I would say straight-out that this is clearly a bootleg DVD. All but the brightest, outdoor, filmed scenes are extremely grainy, like a 2nd- or 3rd-generation VHS copy from the 1970s.Which frankly I wouldn't mind, if I were buying a rare, hard-to-get video that is only available through those kinds of 3rd-hand sources. But this was sold as a ""real,"" commercial DVD, which makes me resent the awful and amateurish copying job. It looks so terrible that I was distracted from watching the story, which by the way is also done in a dated and amateurish way. For example, there are numerous odd scenes where the characters, alone, speak directly to the camera, making funny faces and delivering soliloquies to explain themselves -- not unprecedented, but hardly something you expect nowadays, so it is jarring.Buy it if you are interested enough to ignore all of the above, but don't get your hopes up!"
1,More choppy than Henry's marriages!,"This unfortunate adaptation struggles from the beginning, and never finds it's footing. It combines modern, reality TV style ""confessionals"", budget costuming and awkward dialog that makes the movie look like a video done as an enthusiastic high school project. I adore costume dramas of all eras and all periods, but this was awful, period."
1,Listen to the audio book instead.,"I saw this video after having listened to the 17 hours of the audio book and was very disappointed. The Hollywood version was better produced and had better cinematography but it also disappointed, both were off the mark in their own ways. The audiobook rocks! Listen to it while you are doing your chores or in the car and you will love it!!! Juicy, juicy, juicy!!! All 17 hours of it. Don't cheat yourself."
5,Lol @ having to import a cd by a band from my own country,I'm only reviewing this so I can give it a rating more deserving of GSS...
2,hmmm...,"I've heard this album discribed as revolutionary or even ground breaking fresh....I on the other hand have heard music like this before...to know what im talking about you'd have to play final fantasy games...the music in those games is roughly the same as these guys except this is with vocals....and for the record, the music in final fantasy games is basically a japanese symphony..............yup"
4,The Story of Modern physics,"This is a very fine book for those who want to read about the step by step development of the Modern concepts in Physics, Relativity and Quantum Theory. Author in a descriptive way describes the concepts proposed by individuals how and where they failed and therfore the results that we know today. Although a general knowledge of Physics is required, hard mathematics is not required. For those interested a littel more about formalism, author has what he calls ""Amplification"" windows.Author takes us from Classical concepts through Relativity into Quantum Physics. There are key comparisons where the author explains how each Physicist interpreted fomulas and which one failed and why. From this you can see the different philosophical point of views. It is written intensly but no point seems to be missing"
2,A STRONG SOUR FRAGRANCE,"FOR ALL OF THE POSITIVE THINGS I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS FRAGRANCE, I ORDERED IT AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FRAGRANCE. I HAVE USED IT ONCE AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER TRY IT AGAIN. ACQUA DI PARMA COLONIA IS WAY TOO UNPLEASANT FOR MY TASTES."
4,Seems to work fine and is comfortable,Get the larger size if you are wondering! I bought a small at first and had to go back and buy a Medium. (and I'm not very big)Seems to work great the few times I've used it since I got it.
1,Misleading,"I adhered to their sizing guidelines 100% and when this arrived it was about two sizes too small. It's like children's sizing. I was very disappointed, especially since they wouldn't let me return it. Money wasted."
4,These are a good product.,Sizing might be a little counter intuitive. A bigger girl might prefer a smaller or a smaller girl might prefer a larger. It's about the space between the legs to some extent. They wear nice for my girls.
4,"George Jones, really great!!",I really enjoyed hearing him sing. The coloring was not as clear as I had hoped.
3,The Disco Comeback,"Frankie was one of the many artists that jumped on the 'disco' bandwagon and this album is the proof. Though mostly formulaic, some tracks are still irresistible (such as Venus) others not so much. The album contains the extended mix of Venus too."
2,Am I supposed to read lips or just guess what's going on?,"This is a half-assed attempt that could have been done out of someone's garage. A few good tidbits here and there, but nothing 'new' or 'earth shattering'. All the material here is from the national archives. The color portions are home movies made at Der Fuhrer's mountain retreat where Eva spent most of her time before she was exiled with Adolf to the bunker. Only very novice historians will learn anything here."
3,Mainly holiday films - little story,This DVD shows mainly holiday film of Eva Braun; does not convey much of her life with Hitler.Some of the narrative is drowned out by ridiculous music.
4,The Lion Graphic Bible: The whole story from Genesis to Revelation,The book is excellent and far more complete than I expected. I think it could be an excellent teaching tool for children starting at about the preteen level. I think it is a bit advanced for younger children particularly those who have not received some education about human reproduction/ attraction etc.
2,Confusion throughout the book,"I was looking for more vampire books after I exhausted the Anita Blake series. I gave this one a try. I wish I hadn't. I still am so confused about strigs, strigoi, companions, enforcers, the hunt, you name it.Basically, the book is a tease. You get a quick introduction to a character or concept and then you're whisked away to the next thing. I purchased the 1st four in this series. The second book helps explain a bit more. I still have so many questions.I recommend reading the other books in the series first, and then, if you have time to kill, try this one. Prepare for the response of ""huhhhhh???"""
3,Maybe it's just me....,"but I had a hard time getting in to this book. Seemed like too many characters right off the bat so it was hard to get a grasp as to what was going on and the time frame and the characters ... so, i've put it down and am hoping to revisit. Hate to miss out on a good vampire story so i'll shelf for now and try again."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"That being said, DON'T!!... I am a big fan of vampire books, and have made my way through the worst, but this one may top 'em. This book provides no characters that you care about, no information on who they are and why they are the way they are. Everything important in this book is described as assumed knowledge. For some reason the author felt the need to not write any background for the story, instead pointing you to a redundant glossary. I did make it through, but in the end, I tossed this book in the trash. If in the end you don't care about any of the main subjects in a story, what's the purpose?"
1,I just couldn't like the main character,"At this point, I have read a lot of Paranormal Romance Novels. I had never read Susan Sizemore but I had head such great things that I was really looking forward to reading her books. In fact, I ordered the whole series right off the bat.I was shocked to see that the main character was already way involved with his love interest from the very beginning and was in the process of being very very nasty to her. It was confusing to figure out the nature of their relationship and its not till very late (almost the end) in the book that it is really explained.I speant the whole time disliking him and wanting her, who I actually liked, to break it off with him.I love Vampires as teh main characters of books. I get that they have to be ""bad"" good guys to live up to standard but I really thought he was just too extreme. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I think I'm going to skip (despite the money wasted) reading the rest of the series."
2,Disjointed with poor grammar,"Although some of the concepts in this book are new and intriguing, the grammatical errors were extremely distracting. I Hope Ms. Sizemore finds a new editor for the rest of the series.In retrospect, the story is pretty good---but in the reading it was disjointed and hard to wade through.I'll probably read at least the next one in the series, but will give up if it doesn't have dramatic improvements in continuity, style and grammar."
5,Linkin Park-Frat Party at the Pancake Festival Review,"Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" was the best-selling album of 2001, and now they have a cool VHS/DVD, too. I shall review the DVD.This DVD features the ""One Step Closer"", ""Points of Authority"", ""Papercut"", ""In the End"", and ""Crawling"" videos, live footage of them at the Ozzfest 2001, interviews, touring information, and a lot more. The bonus features include Mike & Joe's artwork, where it shows you the original Hybrid Theory EP cover (drawn by both), Marilyn Manson as a school teacher (drawn by Mike), and a lot else. It also includes a tour of Chester's Tattoes (which is pretty funny), audio only ""My December"" (which is a slow, ""funky"" song), an High Voltage (which is pretty much a pure rap song), and a lot else. You should buy this even if you don't love Linkin Park, because it's pretty damn entertaining.(oYo)"
5,cool ese,"Está bien chevere y a la moda como yo, ese, nomas le falta el afro, ese.Waka waka waka.....me vale pirrin lo que digan...waka waka waka.Está bien machin rin.Sobre todo la version country de crawling.Gracias a que lo compre, por fin pude ver el video de in the end...waka waka waka...Por cierto, todos ustedes son una bola de nacos, eses,haberlo comprado me puso bien happyluche.YoWaka waka waka, ese."
2,Linkin Park is the best band i've ever heard,"LP is going to up. Why don't you have your tour concert in indonesia? There's lots of your fans in here. I always read from magazines that ""almost of your concerts done well"" well, I beleive in that. I saw on tv your tour in Filmore, Guys, I'm so proud of you. Please, don't change. I like you, your music so energic. Beleive or not your music has turned me to be someone who trust herself and beleive that i could be someone i want to be. Thank you, I love you very much. May God bless you forever."
5,this dvd is awesome,"I LOVE Linkin Park and if you do too you'll love this dvd. It shows all the behind the scenes action during tours, videos, and just life with them. It also has making of their videos and director's views. It contains every video they've made and also extra tracks. It's a really fun dvd to watch and even if you don't like linkin park all that much, after watching this, you'll love them. If you don't get this dvd, you're missing out!"
5,Must have,"If you love Linkin Park, then this is a must have. It shows you a side of them that makes you love them even more. It also gives you not only an inside look, but great music as well. A must have for any Linkin Park fan."
5,GREAT ADDITION TO YOUR LINKIN PARK COLLECTION,this is a great DVD it has all of their videos from HYBRID THEORY you also get to hear them work on SOMEWHERE I BELONGyou get great live footage you get to see them make their videos to CRAWLING and IN THE END you get alive video of CRAWLING you get to hear MY DECEMBER and HIGH VOLTAGE if you know the secrets you can hear the remix to ONE STEP CLOSER (sorry not the version with Jonathan Davis) it also has a few funny moments you better buy this DVD
4,Hardly complete,"Can't find ""Bell Bottomed Tear""? How come!Not even ""I'll Sail This Ship Alone""As the other one said, may be ""Carry On Up The Charts"" a better place to go."
5,Outstanding variety of Power Metal,Mob Rules might be a bad choice for a band name for obvious reasons but this CD rocks. There are a lot of keyboards in each song but they add tremendously to the overall sound rather than weaken it. The rythms are solid and powerful and the vocals are excellent. The singer has great range and the melodies are very catchy. This CD grows on you quickly and is a frequent player in my catalog. The songs are quite heavy and will have you singing along in no time. If you enjoy power metal with a lot of melody you won't go wrong with this.
1,90 minutes of my life that I will never get back.,"This has got to be the worst movie that I have EVER seen. They took the script to Cruel Intentions(a movie I did like) and just did some cutting and pasting. They were the exact same lines and the exact same scenes. The plot to Cruel Intentions did cross some reality boundaries, however in comparison to this movie, the first was the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I am so disappointed in myself for not turning it off during the first scene. Now, you may be thinking, hey a movie with naked people in it...fun...but the people in this movie are not even attractive. If it's ever on cable and you can find nothing better to do, then maybe you could watch it for some comedy relief, but don't waste the $4 that it costs to rent it."
1,Leftovers are up,"Well the last one worked... hmm. Damn, we didn't make room for a sequel. Well let's just put in new actors (which aren't as good as the origonal stars) and give them the same script. If you liked Cruel Intentions the origonal, don't waste the two hours on this. If you didn't like Cruel Intentions, don't waste the two hours on this."
1,what was that all about?,"Okay so Cruel Intentions 2. A big no-no. I own it on DVD only because I couldn't find Cruel Intentions by itself. I deeply regret it now though cuz it seems the first one is available everywhere now...The sequel is a total rip-off from the first movie with obvious changes. Instead of playing the doctor's daughter at the beginning, Sebastian played his old principal's wife. And then Sebastian falls for the Headmaster's daughter like in CI. The actors they took to re-enact the characters don't compare at all. It's a shame when you think of the excellent job Sarah Michelle and Ryan Phillippe did. There's no plot to this story, too many swear words and too much nudity and just bad dialogue and bad... everything.If you really wanna see this movie, don't buy it. Rent it so if you can't handle it anymore you can always return it right away. That's what I would have done!"
3,Just horrible,"I've seen the first Cruel Intentions, which I didn't like very much. Compared to this movie, the original looks like Casablanca. I watched this one on DVD. You can see why it's direct to video. i understand the characters are the same because it is a prequel. But the dialog and plot were virtually the same. What do you get with this one: cheap exploitation, racial sterotypes, and a ridiculous, unfathomable ending which is cut off all too soon."
2,"Hey, didn't I just see this???","Three words: What the f*ck?I watched this movie with my friends in order, and when this one was put on I asked them ""Haven't we just seen this""?Riddle me this,why would anybody waste their time, money and limited acting skills on a crapulent sequel like this? Sebastian is pitiful, Kathryn needs prozac and pathetic who-the-f*ck who played the virgin were as rusty and staged as... actually, there's nothing to compare this cr*p to. rent the original. It rocks. The cast is famous. There's chemistery in it. Why anyone would remake it will remain a question on my mind for years."
3,a joke!,"i have seen this movie a few times and it isn't the best movie, but i didn't hate it. actually until i just read the reviews i thought it was a comedy, mocking the first movie. like a ""scary movie"" type thing. but to know that the writer might have been serious does down-grade the movie a bit. i didn't think the cheesy characters and scenes could be anyhting but a joke!with that said it was stupidly funny, i would reccomend watching it for a cheap laugh."
1,...Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Philippe were where?,"Cruel Intentions 2 (2000) Robin Dunne, Sarah Thompson, Amy Adams, Keri Lynn Pratt, Barry Flatman, Mimi Rogers, Teresa Hill, Barclay Hope, D: Roger Kumble. Deteriorating (and even more unsavory) direct-to-video preclude is basically meloporn and treachery to the story of DANGEROUS LIAISONS as it shows the preparatory events of the sexually-active stepbrother-sister couple, Sebastian (Dunne) and Katherine (Adams), where she steps in the way of his new assignment: the headmaster's daughter Thompson. Bad comparison of the original is more of a rehash, though with the same director, but with different faces and hypocritical performances. Running Time: 90 minutes and rated R for sexual content, nudity, and some language."
2,IT HAS SOME GOOD MOMENTS BUT DISSAPOINTS OVERALL,"I have to admit that I enjoyed the first half of this movie, knowing it was an excuse to look at some attractive actors doing totally unrealistic things (I was a MELROSE PLACE fan), but after awhile it started to get too superficial even for m y ""forgiving"" tastes. It unfortunately is worse than the first CRUAL INTENETIONS which we all know was never supposed to be an intellectual film either. What truly dissapointed me about this movie is the way it ends, but I would give away the whole ""story""to explain my point. As in the earlier film, there were evil characters (or at least ""soulless"" ones) but watching the basic theme of ""good triumphing over evil"" was satisfying; I got no such satisfaction from CRUEL INTENETIONS 2."
1,By a 13 year old Viewer,"I found this movie appaling! The original Cruel Intentions is one of my favorite movies so I thought that I would much enjoy the sequel. It's a miss of bad acting and other gross humor that not that many people would enjoy. In Cruel Intentions Witherspoon, Phillippe, Gellar did an great job of acting and playing out their roles. This movie featured bad acting the plot was a cheap imitation that didnt make sense and the shower scene and the scene with the horse was unnesesairy and innapropriate. I would greatly urge anyone that is thinking about seeing this movie not to buy it, but rent it if they still want to see. It is nothing like the original"
4,I was plesantly surprised,"I have to say that I was plesantly surprised by this movie. I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this movie. But, I think that it actually rates really close to the original. Don't get me wrong, there are some holes in the plot. But, I have to say this movie actually kept my attention all the way through. The writing was clever. Although I thought there were way too many ripped off lines from the original. Overall I liked this movie. I would recommend it, just to see how you like. This movie you will either love or hate."
1,Truly insulting!,"As a fan of Cruel Intentions, knowing that it was a trashy teen flick, I was truly disappointed by Cruel Intentions 2. The first movie at least has a entertaining plot as it is based on Dangerous Liaisons, however ""2"" has a weak cast (excluding the hot lesbian twins) and steals far too many quotes from the original film - so much so that i was bored!! Bottom line; no plot, lame cast, un fulfilling 2 hours with no real ending."
2,No wonder the original stars wanted no part of this!!!!!,"It was an attempt at a view of the characters before they became as corrupt, but there was a lack of character development. In addition, those portraying Katherine and Sebastian did not even look close to the original characters. The movie kept my interest, and was somewhat entertaining, but disappointing. I disagree with other reviewers about the ""porn"" content of this movie. There were many innuendos but little graphic nudity. If you saw the first movie, this film will interest you by somewhat explaining the character's motivations. However, unless it was given to me, I would not add it to my DVD library. This movie will make no sense if you have not seen the original Cruel Intentions. I recommend that viewers rent it, take it back, and call it a night."
1,Please stop the pain...,"This movie was forced upon me. It does not surprise me that this pilot never convinced any television executive to buy it.If I have to listen to one more crack about long island iced tea not tasting like tea...*sighs* I strongly desire a negative star rating, just for this movie."
1,Really Cruel,"It is absolutely cruel to have anyone endure watching this movie. It is the worst movie that I have ever seen. The ending was so disappointing that it will be hard for me to get excited about seeing another movie. It was filled with pointless nudity,profanity, sexual explotation, and there was no redeeming value in anyone in the movie. One is not a low enough rating for this movie. It was a waste of effort and money for those who had any attachment to it.There was one charater prone to choke or puke throughout the movie and at the end i felt like doing both!"
2,Not too bad!,"I was a big fan of Cruel Intentions so when I heard of the T.V. series that was supposed to air last December I was excited, but then quicky dissapointed to learn that it had been cancelled. Well it recently aired on cable the other night and it was really not as bad as most people would think for a kind of straight to video movie. It is a prequel so you get to see how Kathryn and Sebastian really met and what ends up leading them to their little games they play with innocent guys and girls. Unfortunately none of the actors from the Cruel Intentions movie are in this sequel/prequel but it really was not that bad!! I can see how they would not air the series on T.V. cause it definately is not suited to be on regular T.V. but I found it to be funny and entertaining. It kept me interested the whole time. Watch it and see!"
2,Decent for a TV Show,"For being a scrapped TV show turned into a movie, it wasnt that bad, I know Ive seen worse!! My only problem with it was the lame jokes (plenty abound)and recycled plot lines and jokes (""this sure dosent taste like a iced tea"", ""Its from long island"") Coming from the same team except for the actors, Who incedently arent that bad, its just the material they have to work with, I expected a little better. Some of it was interesting but overall not a very good prequel. And they show like 20 scenes in the preview that arent even in the movie, including those scenes might have made the movie more interesting and a little longer that 87 min."
2,Not even good,"Okay, it was an alright movie but compared to the first one it really was just not good. i mean they use so much stuff from the first one that its like wait i thought this was suppose to be a little different. i really dont recommand this movie unless your curious."
5,Very Nice,"This movie is for those who have been into the same situation as the story itself.It gives insights into the realities about love and betrayal.It is about self-esteem, and how to manage oneself in complicated relationship. It brings funny feelings and turns to humour of what most would spend months of regrets and ponder.My point is, this movie relieves feelings of lose and regrets because of the exposed intricacies and stratagem used by the characters in this movie.It's narcistic, funny and cruel but very sweet too.Most of all, it brings forth the message that before we can love others, we must first learn to love ourself."
1,[Too Bad]- I couldnt choose 0 stars,This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. No plot.. NO POINT...
1,song title,does anyone know what the name of the song is that is played at the begining when sebastian is in the cab?
4,three words: the shower scene!,"This movie is a guilty pleasure in every sense of the word. It's certainly not a great movie by any standard (but the original movie wasn't exactly a classic either). But it has two things going for it: first, it doesn't take itself at all seriously; there are quite a few funny jokes that would have been considered too over-the-top for Cruel Intentions 1), and second, THE SHOWER SCENE! That scene alone is the main justification for the movie. (...) this scene will definitely appeal to you. I found it the most intellectually satisfying part of the movie. Aside from this, the plot (though dumb) was actually good enough to keep me watching right to the end. So grab a beer, turn off your brain, and enjoy!"
1,"Cruel intentions 2, Just pure rubbish",This film is very different from the original and is terrible in many ways. the first is better however the second and is something that would appeal to 13 year olds. It doesnt even have the same actors/actresses in it which is also a real let down.Just pure crap so i reccomend not even bothering to see this film at all. or buying it for that matter.
1,couldn't hold a candle to the original,"What parts I did manage to view in this movie, made me wonder what the producers were thinking. It has unecessary nudity that doesn't fit. The acting is so poor that I turned it off. I just couldn't handle it"
1,These are alright if you need coasters.,"About 1 out of 5 of these discs ended up in the garbage. I only burn at 4X and even still, 1/5 of them reported an error. I've had my CD burner for a year and a half and have never had this problem with Memorex, Imation, or Fugi discs.I bought these because of the Sony name... but trust me when i tell you - STICK TO MEMOREX!"
3,"Good product, but low lifetime","I never had any problems writing the disk, unlike the other reviewers. Infact, I have bought these twice and may be 2 or 3 out of the 100 had problems, while writing.But my problem is an entirely different one: they don't last long. The lifespan of a CD is probably 20 times playing entire CD, and I guess it makes sense to expect more. After this time, the tracks skip.If you don't frequently listen to CDs and maintain them well, then this would be a good product for you."
1,sony cd-r's are some real junk-12-12-03,"I bought a hundred, at KMart, for a project that needed done. So I spent the few bux more to buy Sony CD-R's. I'm getting a 30% failure rate. So I hunted around (spending more and more of my time here...) and got ahold of sony per the 800 number. Their position? (Other than that fact that the very first thing on their tape is not 'welcome to Sony' it's 'If you've had a failure with A, press one, if you've had a failure with B, press two, etc') That I should package up and ship my four boxes of Sony off to some PO Box, at MY EXPENSE, and they'll replace them. Sheesh. Why didn't I just buy Verbatim CD-R's (Ive had no problem with those) or what ever the cheapie brand might be at one of the big chains (Ive had no problem with those, either). So if you're looking for media, don't shop Kmart, and don't shop Sony. Happy holidays, everyone."
2,Broken product.,I just got my first! And for my surprise when got to my house! It was already broken! Not working at all!
5,"""fun"" for the reader if not the writer","If you are a Dorothy Parker fan, this is a great book. It has the seiries of ""I Hate...."" poems, which is not collected anywhere else, as well as other gems Dottie deemed not worthy of being republished elsewhere. Mr Silverstein's excellent use of footnotes helps explain what was going on with Dottie when various poems were written. I have always admired Dorothy Parker but I definitely wouldn't want the pain and anguish of her life.So if you are a Dorothy Parker fan, get this book for the lost poems so you can have a full collection of this underrated literay star. I recommend it highly."
4,has retained its value over the years,"Three years after publication, the march of technology has not made this book obsolete. Levy correctly identified the sore spots that technological change has rubbed on our sense of civilized society, and pointed out to what degree the problems were realized 100 years ago. Previous reviewers complained about pointlessness, but I appreciate Levy's many small points as well as his few large ones. However, I wouldn't buy a copy; this is the kind of book that public libraries are good for."
3,Library of Congress' review,David is the first speaker on Part 2 ofLibrary of Congress Series on the Digital Future: Collection
1,"This is 1945 edition, very out of date","This is a facimile reproduction of the original 1945 edition of the book. There are more recent editions, at least as recent as 1967 as I used that edition as the text in a Glacial Geomorphology course I attended in 1972. Unless you just want this for historical reasons, get something more current. Flint wrote an excellent book, but this is badly out of date. At least get his most current editions, whatever that is."
4,Lexus of bird cages,"Love the look of this cage. It is a very efficient home for my bird. There were only two small problems. One, the top portion of the cage was bent a little, but not noticeable. The second issue was that the holes on the top perch were not completely open and we can't store one of the feeding dishes up there. It was easy to put together."
5,Excellent for your money,I love the design and look of the cage. It's durable and for a great price. I went to petsmart today and saw the same cage for $399.99.
4,Parrot Cage,"The cage is very nice ! However i wish i would have purchased a little larger cage for my small macaw ! But he only sleeps there at night , so it is good . Putting the cage together by myself was very frustrating ! It did not take minutes as reported ! A few choice words were said , as the assembly was progressing !!!!!The cage is nice , but i purchased a cage from Avian Adventure last year and the quality was much better ! Assembly was much better , only took minutes . A liitle extra price was worth the purchase !"
4,affordable and sturdy,"After shopping for some time for a larger bird cage, I decided on this one due to the size and price. While others have commented that the pieces were broken or damaged, all the pieces that were supposed to be included were present and intact. The instructions are non-existent, but it is a pretty straight-forward assembly. When assembled, the cage is pretty sturdy and looks nice. This cage is a great buy for the money as I have seen similar cages for twice the price. I definitely do not regret buying this birdcage and would recommend it to a friend."
5,Nice size cage,"If you have the time to teach yourself how to build a bird cage, this is the cage for you. The instructions in the box didn't help at all! Took about 40 minutes to assemble. Besides that my bird is very happy. Great buy for the money!"
4,Bird,Great cage for 1 cockatiel. I wish it had storage space on the bottom. my bird seems to like it.
5,birdcage,this is a great product my bird loves his new cage.i would recomend this to other customers.its a great product
3,Medium Bird cage,"I have a medium sized bird, an African Grey Timneh. I thought I would use this for her sleeping quarters. This cage is too small even for that and she couldn't open her wings to stretch. She hated this cage and fought me everytime she thought she had to go in it.When it was shipped to me, one of the playground seed holders was completely snapped off.Overall, it is generally a good cage in the appropriate size and when it isn't damaged in shipping.I have an extra large version of this cage that my bird loves.I would use it for a smaller bird, such as a cockatiel size, but no larger or smaller. Too small of a bird will get their wings caught in the cage bar openings."
5,The alcatraz of bird cages,"Our parrot will not be able to escape from this thing! The directions were good, it went together easily. The food doors are really nice; I don't have to risk losing any blood from reaching my hand in the cage. The food doors swing open so that you can easily fill them.The perch on top is really nice when he wants to come out to play. The main door has a really strong latch, and this thing is sturdy. It is also easy to move with the wheels on the bottom. I would definitely recommend."
3,Poorly written directions,"Tis is a good product, but the directions leave a lot to be desired. They skipped an entire section on how to put the seed trap together.Plus, I found it for $50 less at walmart."
2,very hard to clean,the cage itself is ok...the cleaning is a hassle! It's impossible to get the seeds out of the seeds catcher...It takes me an hour to clean the cage!
3,Alright but far from being very good,"This colllection of 21st century disco is not very good. The tracks do not stick out and it is easy to see why Ministry of sound discontinued this collection. The tracks are not that funky or twisted they are just boring,MOS has better collections and this is one that should definitely be skipped. Also the fact that it is mixed doesnt help because it makes the tracks even harder to stand out from one another."
1,No book yet???,"Ordered text on the 19th of Aug, paid for expedited shiping and still have no book.I received other books I ordered on the same day at regular shipping rates. The book I needed the most is still not here!!!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED THIS SO HOW CAN I REVIEW?,I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS BOOK - I HAVE SENT SEVERAL E-MAILS TO THE SELLER WITH NO RESPONSE. PLEASE CANCEL AND CREDIT MY ACCOUNT.
1,Absolutely terrible service,"I ordered this product on August 13th, and it is now September 17. It has not arrived yet. I needed that book for a class, and I will have to go out and buy a different copy just so I can do the reading. The service from this seller sucks!"
2,college book,"I ordered this book for my class. I paid extra to get the book over nighted or in 1day and it took longer. The company never informed me that the book was here and that it was left in my apartment office.The company never left anything on the door letting me know that I was to pick it up in the office, it wasnt until I called looking for the book that I was told that it was left with the apartment. So paying extra was a waste of money."
1,STILL WAITING!!!!,I STILL DONT HAVE THE BOOK I ORDERED!!! IT HAS BEEN OVER A MONTH AND I NEEDED IT FOR MY POLITICAL SCIENCE CLASS!!!
1,The leftist Version of American Government,"This is a great book if you don't mind all the ""Bush Bashing"" and leftist views of the authors. It does not present both sides equally and is very misleading to the average reader. The bias is very evident if you are independent minded and research both sides of an issue. I was very disappointed that my professor chose this book for the class. I have reviewed other political science books that are not as biased and present both sides."
3,Disappointed,"This book was advertised as NEW, and when I received it, I took a look through it. It was in good shape as far as the physical condition of the hardcover and binding, but when i looked further into the book, I noticed that it has highlighting and pencil marks in some of the paragraphs of the chapters--not what I expected of a NEW book... very disappointed in the description. You shouldn't advertise as NEW...it should have been LIKE NEW or Gently Used. I don't like receiving books already marked, when that is not what I was expecting."
2,All freakin highlighted!,Well it arrived in good time. Not until I got into class and opened my book to chapter one did I notice the HIGHLIGHTER. Chapter one is completely marked all over in purple and pink highlighter. I am very unhappy I won't be buying from this person again.
5,Excellent Reading for everyone,This book is excellent reading for all Americans. It should be taught in our Junior High Schools around the country.
4,I was satisfied,I was happy when I got the book because it came just in time and it looked in good shape! =]
5,Christmas is really about love anyway,"What an interesting choice to not do an overtly Christmas episode that aired on December 25. I'm really impressed by Leverage's originality. Nate's complexity became more understandable to me in this episode, due to terrific writing (from the very beginning of the series) and the acting of the great Timothy Hutton. Nate's and Sophie's relationship is so understated. Every character shines, once again. I think this is the only series that philosophically uplifts me without being mixed with some sadness (although it often has its situational moments). It just occurred to me that the ""Moonlighting curse"" might have had more to do with the female lead's character being basically unlikeable -- not something that you can say about Sophie. This series appreciates women, and basically loves people."
3,I Love This Series but,"Most of the episodes in each season of Leverage have been great ""sting"" operations that reeled you in BUT this episode The Gold Job was filled with things that only as idiot would fall for and since it challenged my common sense this (and ONLY this) episode gets 3 Stars for the producers getting lazy."
5,Enjoy a good con?,"Leverage delivers great entertainment! The Mastermind, Grifter, Hacker, Thief and Hitter always deliver suspense, humor, and glimpes into the lives of five broken thieves. The hitter, Eliot, is played by Christian Kane who does ALL his own stunts and is the actual fight coordinator. You will not see better fights in television - the ""Carnival Job"" will blow your mind. A strong ensemble of actors draw you into the lives of the uniquely talented criminals as they band together to provide Leverage for people the law can't or won't help. Great writing and creative twists, as in ""The Girls' Night Out"" and the ""Boys' Night Out"", keep Leverage fresh and exciting in Season 4!"
2,"Close, but no cigar","Have the producers changed writers? Season 4 has not been nearly as entertaining as previously. The ""Gold Job"" was clearly not up to standards. If I had not purchased the entire 4th season for downloading, I would have skipped this one. It just did not have the flow and interest of previous episodes."
5,Leverage S4,I like the series! Why do these reviews have a word minimum for submission? It rally takes away from the 'ease' of providing consumer reviews.
4,Great show but quirky DVD,This Leverage DVD set of 4 disks is great. It includes bloopers which is something I enjoy watching. All the shows are so good. Each week the team gets to play a different character which I would assume would be an actors dream. I love the show and wish it would have been renewed. My only demerit would be that each time an episode starts it shows the captions. I can easily turn them off. It's just annoying. I still recommend this DVD for the fact that it is all about the show.
3,waiting for replacement DVD,"We've been working our way through series DVDs of Leverage - purchased each of four seasons from a different seller on Amazon. When we got to Season 4 last week, we were frustrated and disappointed that three of the four discs skip and freeze. I contacted the seller through Amazon and got a prompt and polite apology saying a new Season 4 set would be on its way. As long as it comes trouble-free, I'll be satisfied with this seller, stbrosales18, and will use him/her again."
4,"Leverage Season 4, Ep. 16 ""The Gold Job""","I have been a viewer of this show since the first episode and have been purchasing the episodes since they became available. That being said, this episode shows the growth of the team in that Hardison is choosing to start from step one, a training con sort of job, whereas before he thought he was already at the top. At the same time he gave them a little taste of his value to the team which should also show the audience that just because after four seasons or in their case four years, something looks easy from the outside doesn't mean that it is. They have growing relationships and motives and personal issues to work on that have all been reflected in the show. I enjoyed it, but I do wish that they could surprise me a little more."
5,Leverage!!,"If you haven't seen leverage, you've really been missing out!! This show is absolutely fantastic. The fourth season is great, loaded with guest stars from earlier seasons. The show has only gotten better!! All about helping people who can't help themselves. Sucj a wonderful show! Drama, Action and Comedy! And the perfect cast!! Please check it out!"
5,Always Great,Leverage is a fantastic show -- this episode was a bit of a departure but as wonderful as always...just really funny.
2,Boring,Leverage is getting to be a gamble to watch. This one is slow and boring and I'm sorry I spent money on it. I hope they figure out that when people are paying per show they at least need to hold the viewer's interest.
1,Terrible,The first 2 seasons were good. The third started to get a little slow and then they ran out of stories but decided to milk the series for one more season. It is simply terrible. Avoid this season.
3,A precious gem an important place among children of today.,"A Friend Is Someone Who Likes You will always be a great favourite for children. Everyone loves the story, and the children who are great friends. It was a great favourite for our children and now it is a great favourite with our grandchildren."
5,TV Show,great show some might not remember Renegadeearly 90's TV show episodes are greatlove season 2
3,Where are the rest???,Well now this is very strange.. Lyle from Millcreek told me on several emails that Millcreek would be releasing ALL 5 seasons in Oct 2010.. but now they are putting out Season 2 on Sept 14??Are we to believe they will release 3 more seasons in less than a month? (After Sept 14th?)Im so glad I have all 5 seasons..Millcreek. just release season's 4 and 5 already!
3,"Mediocre wallet, but you can't beat the price","It's a CD wallet and it holds 320 disks, just like it's supposed to.Other than that, don't expect much. The pages tend to rip out more easily than I expected, but as long as you don't play kickball with it, it should be fine. Also be aware that the CD slots come with the cut-outs scored, but not removed. So you have to go to each of the 320 spaces for CDs and remove the little plastic piece, which is time-consuming. But hey, for the price after rebate, you might as well grab a bottle of wine and make an evening of it.That aside, I have 320 formerly homeless DVDs that now have a place to stay, thanks to Velocity and Amazon.com."
5,Good storage,I needed to find a certain number of massive cd books to get rid of my cd towers (making moving less of a pain).I really enjoy this one because of the sheer number you can store in it. Great product. Just don't try jamming the cd books in too or the book won't close.A plus.
3,"Okay for the price, but not as described.","I was happy with the price I paid for this product (after rebates), but I was very disappointed to find after I received it that it had >50 CD slots missing. I talked to someone else who had experienced something similar. Also, the cover of the case smelled very badly of sweat and after dousing it repeatedly in Febreze, the smell has still not gone away. I would have returned it to Amazon for an exchange but the last time I checked, this product had been discontinued. If you want something cheap, then I would still say this CD wallet works, but just be aware that you won't get exactly what they describe."
3,you get what you pay for,"within 5 minutes of receiving and using this wallet, one of the pages came off its binding inside...not very durable at all but i mean it has a huge capacity and for that price i wasn't expecting much..."
3,It is OK for the price,"It sounded good to have all your Cds at a place in the case and you can carry this with you. That is the reason I brought this item. I used to have 3-4 packs before. Now I can keep them all at one place. But after I purchased the item online, when I saw it personally, I felt its huge. It looked like a Tote. But I got used to it now and its is ok. I wish it were more sleeker than it is."
2,Nav2Net,The zipper is not working well. This looks like it was designed by Navision (poorly). It really skewed my digital vantage point
3,first page falling off,I received one with the first page falling off.Probably Amazon's fault. They should check it before sending it out.
3,Not bad,"Pros: Price (with $10 MIR)Cons: Big in size, pages are permanent - if you want to move CDs you need to take them out of their pockets."
4,Great for price,"Definately not the best that you can get, but for 4 bucks it is way better then the stuff you get at like Walmart. It seems sturdy enough that it wont break apart with normal use."
5,Great product,"I was looking for large capacity of CD wallets to hold my own movie collection. This CD wallet is in perfect side for me and best of all, the price. Other CD wallets in the same capacity costs like $30 at my local store.The construction of this CD wallet is very durable. I second that I have no problem on Velocity rebate"
4,Good CD Wallet,Handling the CD Wallet is convenient though it is broad in width. Easy to keep all CD collection in a single wallet and easy to carry around. Though it is bulky but it servers its purpose. It is definetly not a portable but for only home usage.
1,"Poor Quality, forget the rebate","The quality on this CD wallet is really poor. I really didn't expect Amazon.com to carry something like this. The rebate is valid if you send it 15 days after the purchase date, not the shipment date, not the delivery date.. so if you buy this with SuperSaver shipping you may forget about the rebate. I got mine delivered just a couple of days before the deadline but I had gone on a 3-day business trip. When I was ready to send the rebate, I noticed I was a day late. Bottomline, I wouldn't have paid the price before the rebate for a cd wallet of this quality."
4,Just a great listen,This is such a cool low-key but rockin' band that had it's 15 minutes of fame in the first year or two of MTV but has kept on rockin' very stylishly ever since. This live disc is truly a gem from one of America's most sadly underrated bands. I put this in my CD player every once in a while and it always stays there for several weeks.
5,profound adn inspiring,"the books of teacher Nan Huai Chin about spirituality are the best and the most difficult,many consider him the last great oriental teacher with the most unusual and great wisdomall his books surely are indispensable for the serious student of the Way and they cannot be matched by anyone in profoundity and claritythey are the best companian volumes with the excellent books of Bill Bodri about meditation"
5,QVS Keyboard/mouse adapter,"I priced this at Best Buy and they wanted $25.00. I was able to get this one for just a little over $3.00. It works great, no problems and i am very pleased. Shipping takes awhile but other than that it was worth the wait."
5,It's the seventies again!,I have always loved Angie Dickinson since I was a young teenager. I still am a huge fan as an adult. I still love the Police Woman Episodes from season 1. They are a must have for a Police Woman fan! I had never made a purchase online before but it was such a positive experience I would use Amazon again!
4,angie is great,"police women is a classic tv show ,i watched it when it frist out and was good, but even better know , recommend it to those who like classic tv!"
5,POLICE WOMAN (A GREAT TIME FOR POLICE SHOWS ),"i remember like it was yesterday. what a great series. i hope to see the second season released soon. it would be great to have police story released also in the dvd sets. the first show on this dvd is a police story as they transfer pepper anderson to her new assignment, as police woman."
5,"Please, Sony","Sony: Please release the rest of this great TV series. The other reviewers covered all the attributes of ""Police Woman."" I am simply urging the release of the remaining three seasons. The commentaries alone on the Season 1 release are worth the price!"
5,My Hero is true love without sappiness - great summer read,"Unexpectedly fresh - believably real - incredibly romantic - Marianna Jameson doesn't waste words or use fillers - she keeps the reader on edge until the last page - fast paced and difficult to put down for a minute - finally a great love story that isn't sappy or gooey or over the edge with unrealistic sex scenes. Her ""hero"" is all male - in the best sense of the word - He's likeable, loveable, strong, smart and while he could - he doesn't exude that macho image you'd expect. Ever. Marianna Jameson has a winner - what a great debut novel!"
2,2.5 stars,"Miranda Lane has built her successful career as a romance novelist writing Southern set tales with gentle, beta heroes. Told she must set her newest novel in the land of the Yankees with an alpha hero, a cop no less, she rebels. However, economic reality forces her to submit to her editor's demands. However, she will have to do some research to get a role model on whom to pattern her hero. That's where Officer Chas Casey comes in. Observing him, and getting in his way, Miranda begins to change her mind about hating alphas. Chas is not half bad, once she gets to know him, but her avoidance of literary macho men stems from issues she has with real ones. Only by facing the pain she hides can she succeed in literature and love both.** A truly sensitive, weighty tale is hidden under the fluff. More focus on the real issue would have made this an excellent novel instead of merely light comedy. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
3,So short!,"The price is right but there's hardly anything on this video.On the plus side, it's the old-school quiet Richard Scarry animation, not the annoying Busytown series."
1,Richard Scarry's WORST Silly Stories and Songs Video Ever!,"I love Busytown, but this has got to be one of the worst Busytown videos ever! One of us was always scared of the Mr. Fix-It part. The problem was we only had one television, so my sisters had to always watch it downstairs while I was downstairs. I think Mr. Fix-It should learn how to fix things correctly, don't you agree? I reccomend the Counting video and the Spelling Bee video for kids instead of this haunted Mr. Fix-It movie."
1,What a joke,"Ordered the book, and it had not even shipped 2 months later. When ordering a book, you expect to receive it within a decent amount of time. This says it will ship in 4-6 weeks, but even that didn't happen. Don't order this book, find one that will actually ship to you. I ended up cancelling my order due to this rediculous wait time."
4,Like their older stuff better,"If you like the college band sound that the Pat McGee Band had in their previous efforts, you will be disappointed. I had to listen to this about 4 times before I decided I liked it. The slick arrangement sound more like Edwin MCain that the tight accoustic sound I expected from Pat McGee. It wasn't bad, just different. Their are some accoustic cuts of song done on the album with the slick arrangements at the end. It's almost like they had to put those out there to appease the early fans like me."
2,Poor quality Film,"If you like westerns, you will over look the quality and focus on the story, mostly older movies, so has poor quality film.The soud is sometime distorted also."
2,"10,000 Ways to Die: Spaghetti Western Collection",THE Quality Of DVD's Are very bad The picture are recorded from the orignal tv or original movie so the quality is very bad
3,To live and die in the old west ( sort of ).,"It was everything I expected, Spaghetti Westerns are to be enjoyed for what they are, an alternative ( and very European ) view of the "" Wild West "", they are at worst bad spoofs of what Americans consider a cultural cornerstone."
3,Sean flynn,"I bought this set for the fim ""7 guns for Timothy."" A good film. I like Sean Flynn and want his films. The film is pretty good, for a low budget western. It is basically a Magnificent 7 rip off. The rest of the films are so so. For the price it is a good deal if you liek Italian/ spanish westerns, which I do."
5,Northrop P-61,Also a good book. Again it had the information I was looking for on this aircraft. Thanks
4,Cold War thriller offers humorous nostalgia.,"The collapse of the Soviet Union robs the center of this political conspiracy thriller of some of its oompf, but Masterton's professional skill at combining suspense with just the right amount of humor, kinky sex, and over the top comic book violence still makes it a fun read. Several American citizens uncover the horrible truth about the true forces running the US government. Tongue in cheek approach gives this conspiracy thriller a playful edge that helps it go down easy. Recommended."
3,So-so,"I like the idea of learning more about Surak and the early days of Vulcan, but I'm not sure this is doing it for me. We learn little if nothing about how Surak developed his philosophy - the story just starts with him a known troublemaker and the reason for the exile ships that eventually lead us to Romulans doesn't seem to jibe with earlier stories. I thought these people were supposed to be those opposed to Surak, wanting to keep using their emotions - now here it appears they are his followers? The present day story seems a bit contrived - now not only has Scotty survived into the TNG era (time is a year after the Dominion War), but so have Uhura and Chekov, and they're still active Admirals! Hopefully the next two books will enrich the Vulcan history and make the present day story more enticing. And note to authors: please, please, we know Vulcan's are precise, but do they have to quote odds to the third decimal place on every other page!"
2,Revising History,"While the book can be quite enjoyable in its own right, the authors don't seem to be familiar with the much better series of books written by Diane Duane. Her history of the Sundering and the creation of the Romulan (Rihannsu) culture is better established in five previous books, and quite frankly makes better sense considering the way the Vulcan people turned out in the canon shows.Books are never completely canon when the shows and movies can change details at any moment, but the books could at least be a part of the time line. Based on [...] information Chekov would be 132 and Uhura 138 years old in this trilogy. And I've never seen a hint of Saavik being married to Spock in the shows- that is sort of incestuous considering their early history. It seems a little too pat to have some of these details in the book and feels more like fannish wish fulfillment than good story-telling."
4,Illogical,"Apart from the plot of the book, I'm curious as to how Uhura and Chekhov can still be active Starfleet officers at well over 140 years old. They're only human! Dr. McCoy showed up on Star Trek: The Next Generation in 2363 or so, and he was obviously not in any shape to be on active duty. I find it hard to believe that Uhura and Chekhov are in much better shape, being only a few years younger. Obviously, there would be medical advances in the almost 400 years between now and then, but if medicine has advanced so much that humans are living a couple hundred years, why was Dr. McCoy in such decrepit condition? In ""Generations"", Picard remarks that there are more days behind him than before him, and I've never heard anything indicating he is over 100. It's nice to have the old characters around, I know, but it just doesn't make sense. Of course, none of the books are ""canon"", so I suppose that allows for some leeway, but some sort of rationality would be nice."
5,In the Beginning...,"Before the Romulans became who they are they were Vulcans living on a war torn and diseased Vulcan. This book takes you through the background of why these people left Vulcan, the various factions who left together, and an important instrument to be used by the Exile's leader to record the history. This book is great and the whole series is really good. You'll not be disappointed at all."
3,"Reasonably well-written, and certainly interesting.","Unfortunately, while the actual writing itself is reasonably well-done, the pacing is a bit off and the plot is a bit disjointed. The attempts to blend the two halves of the story, the flashbacks to Surak's time and the ""current"" Star Trek story, fail pretty thoroughly. There is very little feel of connection between the two. Further, the authors make use of the very common but no less unacceptable device of writing a story in multiple installments none of which constitute an even marginally complete story in themselves, so the book ends on a cliffhanger. (Two cliffhangers, actually, one for each half of the story.) This was, perhaps, acceptable in 1950s movie serials, but is no way to write a novel."
3,Not as good as they used to be,"This latest generation, as another reviewer commented, is the shortest and thinnest yet. Having the surface already impregnated with aloe and vitamin E means, to me, less absorbency. The edges are not as finished and feel rougher and sharper on my skin. They don't stick as well, either. But, beggars can't be choosers; there are almost no unscented liners out there, so this is what we have to use... right? I found some of the old boxes, so I will prolong the inevitable as long as I can. Someone told me about a new organic brand that is supposed to be good (and actually work), I am looking into those, as well."
3,poor printing on some images,"I have say, as excited as I was to get this book...I was let down. There are many of the images that are so dark that there is no definition in the shadows. I know that he did not paint floating faces, or at least that many. I love Sargent's backgrounds to his portraits, and on so many of the images, it's just flat black (his tonal depth is lost). There is even one image that the woman's dark hair falls into the flat black as well...just a floating face. I know that he would represent hair in the shadows with a single brush stroke (which I love) and they've been lost to poor printing. Not all images are like this. So it's still a valuable reference.The information however is so extensive. So I'll keep it and enjoy the reading."
5,"Beautiful, big prints and useful information","This book is of great value for any true Sargent fan. I've learned so much, not only about his life, but also of his painting procedures. I will definitely buy the other volumes."
5,Perfect for Quickbooks forms.,"At first, I was a little skeptical about ordering these envelopes, but since they were from Amazon, I was sure I would have no problems if they didnt work correctly. I can say that though these envelopes are a tiny bit smaller than the ""Quickbooks"" envelopes, they work perfectly. The seal is great, and I will be using these from now on. You cannot find a better price anywhere."
5,Exactly as shown,I hunted on line and in stores for these envelopes and found this to be the best price - exactly what I had been looking for. Will certainly order them again.
5,WORKS WITH Q. BOOKS,"RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE, WORKS NICELY, HOW MUCH MORE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT AN ENVELOPE, THIS REVIEW SHOULD REQUIRE LESS WORDS!"
4,High as a Hawk Inspirational,"""High as a Hawk"" is a very nice book for children in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd grade."
4,Masterpiece,"I was introduced to Lucasson's musical proficiency from Star One and immediately knew I had to delve into Aryeon, in which Human Equation is my first foray. I love the music. It is so different from everything else I own, seeming to seamlessly cross several different genre's of music into an asthetic blend of ear pleasing sounds. I originally rated this at 4 stars, but it wasn't long before this became my favorite CD to listen to for quite some time. How can I not give it five stars? Unfortunately I cannopt change my original rating."
5,INCREDIBLE ALBUM!!,"The latest release by Arjen Anthony Lucassen brings a whole new side to Ayreon that we've never heard before. From the light, melodic voice of Love (Heather Findlay), to the Screams of Rage (Devin Townsend), to the very deep voice of Reason (Eric Clayton). This album has everything you could possibly want: Instrumentals, ballads, folk, metal, symphonic, prog, and rock.This is definitly the best release of the year, and to me, My Favorite album of all time!!"
5,"""Tommy"" for my generation","This album is a monument to the inspired musicianship and songwriting talent of Arjen Lucassen. Every single second of every track grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the very end.You want light thoughtful tunes? You got 'em. Some folky elements? Check. A who's who of the prog/rock/metal scene? James La Brie,Heather Findlay, Mikael Akerfeldt? Yep they're here, among others. Some huge slabs of metal guitar? Present and correct.Each song is perfectly crafted, the story flows to the point where I challenge anyone to listen to this album and not see a movie in their mind.This is ""Tommy"" for the Prog/Metal generation. Timeless and getting better each time it is played.Do yourself a favour - buy this CD, then buy everything else with Arjen Lucassen's name on it and see what a rare and breathtaking talent this man has for writing and playing."
2,Just Terrible,"Prog? Yes, maybe.Sounds more like 'nu-metal'. This is just some double album that sounds like an emo-goth-metal band trying to sound like Kansas.Every track sounds like lots of heavy guitar, big singing (I like the singing sometimes), a few yes-like moments, a lot of lyrics about being depressed and not having self-esteem and arguing with his father and etc. Then there's the growling. GRRR!!!! Well I don't want to beat up on metal too much, it's not really metals fautlt that I don't like it.I'm giving this album two star, it is ambitious and the singers are good, but it just sounds SO ugly and horrible."
2,Obnoxious stab at the epic,"The kind of grandiose (bloated) concept double disc that gives neo-prog a bad name. Despite, or perhaps because of Lucassen's preoccupation with theatrical tendencies, most of his contrived and poorly (over) produced musical ambitions are flat-lined and even sidetracked with laughable vocals masking as ""perspectives"". There can be an audience for this, but it wouldn't be a large one. Metalheads who are closet theater fans or people who find their Evanesence lacking progressive bite perhaps. There is no doubt the songwriter holds talent in the pop-rock arena, but succeeds at alienating a vast majority of potential listeners with thematic self-seriousness and typical modern prog-rock compositional arrogance."
2,Recycled album,"I think I listened to a different album than all other reviewers. This sounds like an absolute recycled album. There's nothing new here in terms of Ayreon music. Electric Castle is still one of my favorite albums, and Universal Migrator Parts 1 and 2 is also a top album, but Arjen insists to repeat the same formula in The Human Equation. It's nice to listen to some new and fresh musical ideas every once in a while, but not here. I tried really hard to enjoy this album, and I give 2 stars for the production, because it is really impeccable, but the music lacks or originality from beginning to end."
2,Elitist,Elitist Rock Operatic Nonsense.Purchase this:1)If you believe you are an 'Elite' musicican [or simply have 'Elite' taste in music].2)If you believe you are an 'Elite' Human being overall.3)If you enjoy spending more money than average to buy this package so that you may then boast about how 'Elite' you are to your friends/co-workers/neighbours/people on messageboards.
5,Brilliantly arranged,"The Human Equation is a definite must for all progressive record collecters. The man behind Ayreon, Arjen Lucassen is a true talent, plus the guest appearances of James LaBrie (Dream Theater) voicing the main character 'Me'. Other borrowed vocals include Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth, Eric Clayton of Saviour Machine, Devin Townsend of Strapping Young Lad and more!The concept behind The Human Equation is, though at times cheesy, an epic masterpiece.The music is diverse, ranging from the power-metal style voices, to the screaming, and the death growling. Keyboards and synthesizers are well composed, as well as the guitar solos and the additional instruments such as the didgeridoo.This is a record to definitely check out if you're into epic sounding music. It has folk, thrash, progressive elements. But most of all, it is great METAL concept album."
3,tiresome,"Even though Lucassen is a very talented musician as well as he is a composer, this time trying to overwork or overpolish the music from his latest project just didn't do the job. The music is forced and the melodies are not as beautiful as the ones on his earlier works. I had the impression Arjen is running out of ideas. The album has great songs but the overall idea is just not interesting. I still admire Lucassen and hope his musicianship improves on further projects.IMPORTANT: If you want the bonus book advertised you will be dissapointed as I was 'cause it doesn't have a bonus book. The bonus book came with the most expensive version of this cd but was wrongly advertised."
1,I didn't receive the item I ordered.,"The book I ordered was Anne of Windy Willows, but I recieved Anne of Windy Poplars. They are essentially the same book, but ""Windy Willows"" is the European publication and that's the publication I wanted and expected. As I said, the story is essentially the same in both books. However, when it was origianally published in the US, the publisheres wanted Montgomery to change the title becuase of the title to ""The Wind in the Willows."" Also, the publishers felt that parts of the book too violent(?) I'm interested in finding out what was so violent that US readers would have found offensive."
1,Not widescreen,"These brawn-and-sandal classics are, unfortunately, presented here in so-called ""full"" frame, 1.33:1. Since they were shot in a Cinemascope-like format, 2.35:1, more than half the original image is lost. This is not an acceptable way to view an epic. Purchase not recommended.Eventually someone will release a widescreen version; all the more reason to send the message to labels like this one: No widescreen, no sale!"
1,DVD Sucks,"Movie not in anamorphic wide screen format. Half the picture is lost. ""DO NOT BUY"" . Scale of 1-5 rating is zero. Wait for the widescreen version."
1,"If they allowed ZERO out of Five stars, I would","This collection is absolutely terrible.I've seen downloads from the internet that were in MUCH MUCH MUCH better quality.This is an absolutely god-awful transfer.With fuzzy, blurry, images, and the tint/color/contrast is all over the place.Most people look orange.The movies themselves, are quite fun, and rather enjoyable.I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for Sword And Sandal movies, and anything starring Steve Reeves.HOWEVER, this particular release is absolutely horrendous.Don't make the same mistake I did. Do not buy this DVD."
2,Missing the Broad Side of a Barn,"While the subject is as interesting as I could possibly imagine, the book itself really disappointed me. Lots of meandering and boring suppositions with occasional facts and interesting tidbits. I was looking for a book that tried to explain wild children, or at the very least would explain and examine how and why they are so different.This read like someone who casually researched several cases and then wrote up an excellent magazine article.Then they added 300 pages of filler off the top of their head, and the book was published."
4,Remarkably Moving Book,"This book is well researched and well written. As engrossing as it is disturbing, this is a must read for anyone interested in the history of lost or abandoned children. A study of personality developement as well as a case by case study of some of the most interesting and well documented cases of lost children. A must read for those interested in discovering what effect isolation or early contact with others really has."
1,you'll find it used soon enough...,"Despite the hip, appealing jacket and auspicious credentials of the author, this book disappoints. It feels like an academic toss-off, designed for the layperson with a fleeting interest, who will leaf through it like a magazine. To swim through the author's disjointed and often autobiographical slough to arrive at the occasional chunks of interesting stuff is simply not worthwhile. On page 9, the author describes his attitude toward his doctoral thesis (...I stayed up, slept late, frequented cafes in the long afternoons, wrote and unpublished novel and an unperformable play, watched far too many old movies, and diligently avoided my supervisor...) Replace 'supervisor' with 'lit agent', and we may have discovered Newton's approach to book writing as well.It's a wonder that a writer could take such a fascinating subject matter and make it so annoying."
2,A Literary Reflection,"The book is not about the children as much as it is about how different cultures and eras have perceived individual ""wild children"" and speculations on the notion of boundaries between the wild and civilized. In fact, most of the stories of feral children are ""alleged"", since there seem to be no confirmed instances of wild children actually raised by animals. The nearest ""authentic"" examples are a few miserable cases of children confined alone in rooms from infancy and a brief mention of a Russian street child who roamed with a dog pack for 2 years. Interesting tidbits, as others have noted, linking Freud, Tarzan, Jack London, and the Cub Scouts, for instance."
4,..but no illustrations,"Interesting, though not an in depth analyses ( as another reviewer stated).Of course, one reason is some of these stories are just passed down tales----not a lot of info/documentation to begin with.Was it just my copy?--Don't know, but there are no illustrations in the book even though there is a whole list of them in the Table of Contents.The seller never returned my email regarding this so not sure if it was just mine or everyone's."
3,Unfinished Book,"I didn't realize this was an unfinished book. At first, I thought there was a download problem but then read that it was an unfinished work as Dickens died before completing it."
2,Mystery of Edwin Drood,"I have read several books by Charles Dickens and this by far was the worst. I was beginning to think Charles Dickens was in a laudanum fog when he wrote this because his choice of words throughout what he wrote of the work was confusing and made little sense. PBS's Masterpiece Theatre's production of ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" finally brought some clarity to this mystery of a story."
1,Read the fine print,"The exceedingly fine print is most difficult to handle. I gave up early on in trying to wade my way through the excellent Dickens prose, impeded by a miniscule type face."
2,Oy!,I've learned a lesson from this book: Read the reviews before downloading a book. I thought I must be terribly thick-headed because I just didn't understand the ending. Thank Goodness I came back and read the reviews to find out it is an unfinished book. I feel vindicated. It is a terrific book for as far as it goes. Seems to me it would be a great English Literature assignment to have students read what there is and then create the ending. I'd love to read those stories.
1,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,"This book was too hard to read and understand because of the ""Old English"" language. Most of Dicken's books are at least readable, but this one was ridiculous. After about 5 chapters I watched the movie instead."
2,Edwin Drood,This book is disappointing because it was never finished by Charles Dickens. it leaves you hanging in the middle of a chapter because Charles Dickens died that day. This was the last book he ever wrote.
3,Prepare to Be Frustrated!,"I say this not because the novel is bad -- it's actually quite good -- but because it was left unfinished; Dickens died while writing this novel. I was prepared to be frustrated that I would never know how the mystery was solved, but the novel ends before you really get to know what the mystery is! Edwin Drood disappears and is presumed dead, and Dickens makes it look as if a certain person is guilty of his murder. Of course, Dickens would never have been so obvious, so it has to be a red herring. In addition to the murder, a person who is obviously in disguise just barely appears on the scene before the story abruptly ends, leaving no clue as to who this person may be. The novel is well-written and intriguing, but without an ending, it's a little frustrating!"
4,Too bad he did not finish it...,"Fun read, and it is the one book of Dickens that reminds me of Wilke Collins, his friend. Too bad it does not have an ending! I think the characters are good, story is interesting."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"At the risk of sounding like a philistine, I really wanted to like _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_, but was disappointed by it. The plot was convoluted, made all the more difficult as the many loose ends are never tied up; many of the characters are, as a previous reviewer mentioned, a bit two-dimensional; and Dickens' social commentary of Victorian class inequities didn't strike a chord with me.While I can understand the potential of the novel, and appreciate the appeal of the author, _Edwin Drood_ is not a book I would recommend for those wanting to read some Dickens."
4,kindle download,"Book downloaded with no difficulties. Some paragraphs are not separated by speakers, but otherwise easy enough to read. Good to read a classic again."
4,"Interesting, this one","This was a slightly unusual novel for Dickens, a bit more dark, serious, and short like ""Great Expectations"" had been, with the previously unused topics of drug use, orientalism, and the church making appearances. It is of course his last and unfinished novel, though as the introduction and notes of the excellent Penguin edition make clear, there is little doubt about how it might have proceeded, and it's not so much a ""mystery"" novel as we have come to understand the term. For heaven's sake, don't get some edition that has been ""finished"" by someone else. What we have here is the dark work of a mature stylist, who still has the gifts of comedy and character. The obsessive nature of Jasper's love mirrors the character of Bradley Headstone in ""Our Mutual Friend."""
3,Font size is smaller than usual for Oxford Classics,"I understand the frustration of the reviewer below. I have uploaded a photo of Oxford's Our Mutual Friend side by side with their Mysery of Edwin Drood. As you ca see, the font size of Drood is smaller than that of Our Mutual Friend (which is the norm for Oxford Classics). The print is often faded in a line or two of pages of Drood as well, unlike the evenly always clear, very legible ink of Our Mutual Friend. If you have good eyes, the smaller font size and inking problems should not be a big problem. The edition itself is as good as any other Oxford Classics edition. I don't know of a competing scholarly edition,."
1,You need a microscope to read it.,"I am stunned to see that Oxford would market a book with such miniscule type as to be almost illegible. This was Dickens's last novel, and I had looked forward to reading it, but this edition is totally unacceptable. Readers, beware!"
4,"Wonderfully written, but I wish it had been completed....","There are so many things to like about this novel- there are quite a few very well-drawn characters, and many that are incredibly sympathetic (like the Landlesses and Mr. Crisparkle) without being irritatingly perfect. Besides this, the villain is not only terrifying, but not as obvious as in some of Dickens' other novels.For the most part, it is quite convincing as well. The only thing that I could not quite figure out was why so many men would fall in love with Rosa Bud. To me, Rosa was very silly and childish and really had nothing going for her except being young and pretty. I would think that Helena Landless is infinitely more appealing- she is not only brave, but compassionate and devoted to her brother. Despite this, I would definitely recommend it- I give it 4 stars only because it is unfinished!"
3,No Ending,To bad Dickens died before he finished the story. He probably could have come up with a great ending for the book.
3,The Mystery of Edwin Drood,Interesting if you are a Dickens fan. Frustrating because the mystery is never solved. The book seems unfinished.Good character development.
4,George Ray Tweed-The Book,"Actually Haven't Read the Book, But Thoroughlly enjoyed The Movie. I'm Gonna Make this Review not a review.I""m Trying to Get contact's of Anybody,with his Authentic or of How to get in Touch with Jeffrey Hunter or His family.I am Mr.Tweed's Grandson.any information would be greatly Appreciated.When any information becomes avaiable. EMail.Thanks. Brian Tweed"
2,waste of money,"This book repeats the same things over and over again. It wasn't helpful at all, it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know."
4,Easy to Follow Advice on Credit Repair,"I bought this book on advice from How-to-get-credit.com I'd have to agree that the information is a little bit old, but it was good information none the less."
1,Don't waste your money!,I just bought these today after returning a box of Memorex which were just as bad. I've tried burning 3 cds so far and each one plays for about 3 minutes before fizzling out into fuzz and stalling the player. Absolute crap! And I'm now going to give a bad review on the Memorex. Is there anything out there that isn't crap these days?
1,Mah Jong Game,"Okay, this is the first time I've had a game that you cannot install on either XP Professional or on 2000 Professional. It installs but will not run properly. I have no idea of the problem, but had it examined by our techie and he said it is a problem with this particular game. He tried it on Windows 98 as well and it ran, but very poorly.Sorry, but that is our experience with this particular game."
3,The only constant is change.,"I liked Theron's ""Head above the Clouds"" better than this. Both cover the same time, region, and political environment. Still, this is a good film.Many film have that one surprise only. Every ten minutes, this film has a new surprise that keeps you watching. It's captivating by being so unpredictable. I wonder if that may be a feature of Spanish film.I was thinking about Frida Kahlo while watching this. Frida suffered from a trolley accident, but moreover, she was fascinated by female suffering. It was a huge theme in her oeuvre. If you like exploring that topic, then you will want to see this.Watching this film was a great way to enhance one's Spanish skills. Unfortunately, there were several occasions in which actors would be speaking and no English subtitles would appear. The subtitle writers were sloppy; they only did about 97% of their job."
3,The Scout and other books,"I found ""Trapping the Jap"" as an interesting war book, written in 1942 when Australia and New Zealand were expecting a Japanese invasion. He writes about three armies landing on the north, east and west coasts of Australia. The six books in the set are Shoot to Kill, Sniping, Guerrilla Tactics, Trapping the Jap, Lurking Death and The Scout. Sniping and Lurking Death include experiences by Ion and others in World War I. His famous book about his experiences in WWI is of course ""The Desert Column""."
1,Perfct title with a box of kleenex,"I recently woke up with this story seeping out of my memory. I too, read this book, maybe 30+ years ago and as a matter of fact; I lost my dad to the wrenching effects of ALS. Somehow this book was meant to be in my library collection because all the pieces fell into place; the reminders of the title, the author, and how it is a story of unbelievable events & love that has stayed tucked away in my heart and now resurfaced. Don't let it go, keep it alive and there will be no regrets."
5,Uniquely Lounge,"I was very sad to hear Mark Sandman had died. Of Morphine's albums, their debut is my favorite. The idea behind the group - two-string bass, sax, and drums - sounds impossible. But it creates an atmosphere evoking smoky bars and irresistable sleaziness. ""You Speak My Language"" is my wive's and my ""song"", although it's hardly sentimental. ""You Look Like Rain"" is probably the ultimate come-on to any woman with half a brain. A world without Mark Sandman is a lesser world indeed."
5,Hip decades before Hipsters,"Still one of the coolest sounding bands to have emerged out of the 'alternative' scene in the 90's. Bass guitar, drums, & a bass sax lend a huge, spare, cool sound to Mark Sandman's authentic, intelligent vocals. Sandman defined intelligent cool long before hipsters arrived on the scene. Standout tracks on this release are 'Do Not Quietly Unto Your Grave' and 'You Speak My Language'. Lots of critical but little commercial acclaim, still a gem worth seeking out since the band broke up when frontman Mark Sandman passed away in 1999. One of my most frequently played out of all my playlists."
4,good cd!,"Where is get wild which cd is that on?is it even on a cd? but anyway this is a great cd , better than greeting by like 2 points so not much!which is also a great album 2,i took 1 star off because i think heroine is very annoying."
1,Only if desperate,"Lawless Range is viewable but only if you have low standards. The sound is good but the picture is soft as if transferred from a used VHS cassette. Lawless Frontier is in worse condition. Again, the sound is good but the film opens with a segment that has little contrast and therefore is almost entirely black. Outdoor, daylight scenes are okay but the the picture is so soft and fuzzy the actors do not have eyes. At best these are worth a penny plus the standard shipping fee. Even at a dollar the disc is overpriced. Buyer beware."
3,A light little satire,"""Report from Paradise"" is Mark Twain's last published book and it took him over forty years to finish it. It has also been reported that it was the only story Twain aka Samuel Clemens actually enjoyed writing.Twain's description of the afterlife as seen through the eyes of a sailor is quite original and there are many interesting aspects to Twain's at times taunting writing, with clear implications to social criticism tetectable.""Report from Paradise"" is a short and light read, and despite it's many inconsistancies it manages to relay a fun quality to it with the expence of blindly followed religious beliefs and ways of thinking."
3,Not the best translation of the Lotus Sutra,"The Burton Watson translation is better for an English speaker, but yeah, this is a more ""Buddhist"" translation, and as such, will appeals to....now get ready......BUDDHISTS!I like it, and hey, I don't even chant nam-myoho-renge-kyo!"
2,"Faithful to its origin, but hard to read","Reading this book is a labor of love. There are many, many Sanskrit words and endless flowery passages that create atmosphere but that shed little light. Way too much to filter through, but your mileage may vary."
1,Timemaster,"Sorry to say, this is a terrible film. I worked on it as their Location Manager and we shot most of it in Tucson, AZ. It had the makings of a good script but it drug out too much. The only good thing was that the money I made spent as well as any other."
4,Creepy,"This one gets under your skin. It spooked the crud out of me, and I only watched it one time. This is not a family-type dog movie. It's very much for adults. Giving away the plot would be dirty pool, but let me tell you this-- you'll never look at your pet the same way again."
4,Bull Terrier Heartbreak,"I don't normally review movies but this one really broke my heart having been 'owned' by an English Bull Terrier for over a decade.The film is in French and is from the dogs point of view...I was actually glad it was sub-titles although it really seems to make it more powerful in it's delivery. Fortunately it also distracts you from the violence on-screen occasionally. Essentially it is a story of abuse, and the effects on each and every charactor in the film...some of the asides are downright hilarious from Baxter (the dog) muttering away in french while you read away at the sub-titles. If you are a Bully fan, as I am, you will doubtless buy it and probably shed a tear or two and put it away in your collection...but you will be haunted by many of the scenes, particularly those that have that ironic French sense of humor"
1,(...),"Others have pretty well summed up the story, I just wanted to add that this movie is the typical sadist, subjectivist, anti-life on earth, bed-wetter's ""life is bad"" movie, where they take the most funny and cheerful dog breed and personify him as a little monster; damned from the start. No I don't own a Bull Terrier. I should be so lucky some day. As one reviewer already stated... by the end of the movie the dog winces and such. (...)NOT FOR KIDS."
1,More Garbage from France,Only the French would think this is a funny movie. Anyone who truly loves Bull Terriers should not buy this movie. Or Buy it and throw it away. Do yourself a favor and get Incredible Journey or Frankenwienie instead.
1,Animal Cruelty,"For all bull terrier lovers, the cover of the video draws one to it. Baxter is a beautiful bull terrier both on the cover and in the film.As a french movie with subtitles, it is cute seeing the dog speak french and to ""hear"" his thoughts.Baxter is a misplaced bully trying very hard to ""fit it"" with all the families he was shifted to for one reason or another. He was never really loved and he was forced to be left alone for days on end without food or water.The ending to this movie was horrific with Baxter being beaten to death by a fascist boy and a subtitle that reads "" I guess I should have obeyed"".As an officer of the Blue Ridge Bull Terrier Club - a nonprofit, tax exempt organization whose charter is the rescue and placement of abused bull terriers - this movie is offensive and should be removed from shelves!"
4,thoroughly enjoyed!,"A fairly simple, although hard to describe-in-a-way-that-will-make-others-see-it plot. It's kind of like a cross between an Animal Planet special and Alice In Wonderland. Not an emotioanl powerhouse or an intellectual's treasure trove, but worth the 90 mins apprx spent watching it. It's definitely stayed with me after almost 5 years after viewing it. I searched the DVD on Amazon after finding it at my local video store. Another local video store had it on VHS, but they eliminated their VHS selection and their following DVD selection just didn't have the variety and eccelectism (is that a word?/sp?) that made me want to go there so often and thankfully they closed down and got the heell outta here a couple or so years after that."
4,Dog Lovers Be Very Aware,"...because after viewing this film you may find yourself thinking,""What in the hell is going on in my dog's head?"". Is your dog really as sweet as you think? He/she sure has a lot of time to think doing all that lying around. People snap all the time and we somehow always find it shocking. Dogs are much more closely connected to that wild genetic material that is telling them to stalk, hunt, kill. I originally saw this movie about 15 years ago and it has stuck with me. A stunning study in existentialism."
3,Have 'Faith' in this novel,"A great depression escapist novel that was kind of fun but lacked anything really exciting. A 20-year-old girl, Valentine falls down icy stairs and discovers a bookshop run by a handsome, bookish intellectual stranger. On a whim she volunteers to work for him and fix the place up. Bill, her millionaire beaux is in love with her but she won't marry him. She's the perfect middle class young woman. Her family was hurt by the crash but not enough that she can't still afford furs and work for free. Bill takes a sailing trip around the world and gets lost at sea. She had promised to marry him via telegram, but when she falls for the bookshop owner, she discovers Bill is lost. What to do? Lot's of fun 30's slang."
2,Poor Protection From Dust,"This filter wallet uses a simple mesh to hold the filters in place, unlike the Tamrac 5329 and others which use a full protective plastic pouch.Once folded for storage, the sides of the wallet are open to the elements. Because the filters are only partially covered by the mesh fabric any dust in your bag or in the environment can make its way onto your filters.I'm going to use this one for storing screw-on filters I don't use regularly. I wouldn't take it into the field - there are much better options for that.I would not use this for square / rectangular gels. The risk of scratching is pretty high and the filters aren't nearly as secure as they are in other wallets."
4,Big but holds it all,I purchased this to replace my 4 slot holder. When all 6 slots are full it is big and bulky but it does hold all the gear. Highly recommend for those that have more than 4 round filters and/or step down rings.
4,Tiffen storage,Filter pouch is well made and handy. Can store up to 6 filters safely and allow access and efficiency on a photoshoot.
1,Save your money,"and buy "" A Vintage Christmas Cracker"" instead. It has all of the same songs, but you get two discs instead of one for almost the same price. Christmas crackers has songs from ""Spirit of Christmas past"" on it and also the songs from a ""Nostalgic Christmas too you"". The songs are very good, it just doesn't make sense to buy these when you can get that cd with 2 discs for the same price."
3,Will see,"I've owned La Crosse projection clocks for years & really enjoy them. I've had two (2) Silicon Atomic Watches which work well in the mainland, but not at all in Hawaii. I have to set the time manually in Hawaii.Am looking forward to this watch as I believe it will set itself automatically, unlike the Silicon watch.We'll see when I get it."
5,"Battery operated, satellite accuracy daily updated","I have a previously purchased watch, same type, about 4 years old and stilloperating, but thought the enclosed battery might be about done, sopurchased an exact duplicate just in case. Info with the replacementbattery shows that the back may be removed and a new battery installedif needed. Watch band quality is not to my liking, but replaced itand original watch is still doing fine.Bill Baldwin, retired Navyzbillyb@verizon.net"
4,I like it but watch band was too small,I broke the watch band on the first day gettig it on and off.The band was too small. I bought a new band at Walmart for less than $10.I like the watch's simplicity. It only has one button and it is recessed.Therefore you cannot catch things on the buttons. A background light on the watch would be nice but I understand that putting one on it would probably greatly shorten battery life. I wore watch to Doctor's office where he was to burn off warts. He used an electronic scaple to cut the warts and majically shot my atomic watch about 4 hrs into the future. The watch reset to the correct time the next day. I have only had watch about a month. It is accurate and I like it.
5,"Great watch, simple to use.","This is a great watch.It looks stylish and syncs automatically with the atomic reference in Colorado. Please note that because it syncs automatically, there is only one button!! You will not be able to easily set it manually, but you don't need to. Using the one button, you just need to select the time zone you are in,and once the watch syncs, you are set.The display is clear from all angles and all light conditions including semi-bright sunlight, which is much better than many other LCD watches.Band is adjustable, great watch."
1,Keeps good time but...,"Unfortunately the wristband was never comfortable and after a year of ownership it is falling apart. The silver paint on the case is about 80% worn off the cheap plastic case. The pictures don't show it, but it is very large watch.I wouldn't buy it again and I am currently searching for something better."
1,defective upon receipt,"I ordered this watch as a gift. When I set it for our time zone, the time was 9 hours ahead. I had to ""pay"" to send it in for warranty repair. Shouldn't have to, when I bought it ""new""! So I paid shipping twice, to receive and ship back. Needless to say, the gift was late for the occasion."
4,I'll keep buying 'em,"This is my second of this model watch. My first wristwatch still works, but cosmetically looks terrible. I bought quality 'twisty' bands for both of them for a better fit. My experience--one application of sunscreen on my skin and all imprinting on the watch's back came off and became a black blotch on my wrist. Now that the imprint's gone, I'll be waiting to see what happens to the remaining finish on the sides with time, sweat, sunscreen and wear. I would be happy to pay a higher price for better finish and materials, so long as the watch design and features were the same--which is why I bought this one. I could not find an all-metal La Crosse of similar design."
1,refund still pending,I had a problem with Guy Gifter and it has NOT been resolved yet. I guess we find out if someone reads these reviews.
3,La Crosse Radio Controlled Watch w/metal band,"I'm not very pleased with my selection. The watch doesn't automatically go from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time. It took me a while to get the correct time. Also, there is no backlighting so it is impossible to see the time in the dark or low lighting."
4,Does What I Need It For,"I purchased this watch because I have a radio-controlled clock on my nightstand and have no way of obtaining the correct time when away from home. I ride the local bus to and from work every day and they have WWVB clocks on board. So, I know that if I am on time with this watch to the bus stop, they will also. The only drawback is there is no backlighting and cannot be read in the dark."
2,Disappointing,"The Album was recorded in Stereo, the number on the Sleeve and on the CD indicate it is Stereo, but the sound is mono! I feel cheated! The low rating is for technical reasons. I would rate the musical quality with four stars, the two other Billy Byers- Albuns (""Basies Beat"" and ""Basieland"") are much better because they do not contain ""Winners"" but Standards or special compositions."
3,It's ok,It has some useful information in it but I think the author could have put it all in two chapters.
5,Punctual.,On time and in great condition. Would definitely recommend it to my friends if they were to need any books. :):)
1,Very Bad Media,"I bought this Sony media because I thought it would be the most compatible with my Sony DRU-530A burner. Unfortunately, every single DVD-R in the pack could not be read by any DVD burner. Please stay away from Sony DVD-R, buy Memorex instead."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I bought these in the 25 pack spindle. Seven of the 25 are unusable because they appear ""non-blank"". One other is not recognized by the burner. I have never had this problem with Memorex."
5,HOLLYWOOD CONFIDENTIAL,"My Mama always said that truth was stranger than fiction and this personal memoir certainly offers a riveting ride through the mean streets of Tinseltown circa 1959 as no work of fiction could possibly do.Because the events and characters are real and not fiction, the reader feels true chills and thrills as the authors take us through the highs and lows experienced by a very young and impressionable 19 year-old actor trying to keep his balance through the surreal and sometimes violent events that he unexpectedly gets caught up in. Especially interesting are his descriptions of how he innocently became involved with top mobster Mickey Cohen and how Cohen drew him into his world, bit by bit.This book reads like a Sam Spade thriller and would make for a great film noir."
2,Not much here,"This self-serving memoir relies on unrealistic dialogue created from events forty or more years prior. It is difficult to accept that mob boss Mickey Cohen would share so much of his activities and cronies with a teenage heart throb. Mickey was known as a big spender, and was a Hollywood mainstay, more often in the company of celebrities and politicians. Nothing published before mentions the authors' relationship. Hollywood history buffs and true crime aficionados might pass on this one."
5,Great read,"This is an extremely interesting book, knowing Steve helps and made it even more meaningful to me. Also knowing Steve I can tell the one (only one) poor review that he, the reviewer, doesn't know what he's talking about. If Steve says this happened, trust me it happened and just this way. Steve's a real straight shooter. Love it and would highly recommend it. I just got my copy today and have already read several chapters. Its habit forming reading. Great job Steve and Craig."
4,Glass Cleaner,I ordered this with the Stoner glass cleaning tool to handle the inside windshield of my PU truck. It worked fine. Order was delivered on time and undamaged.
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I tried Stoners wipes after they sent me some free samples. As a glass cleaner, they were just o.k., but as a rain repellant, it was just sad. Didn't work anywhere near as wonderfully as they'd have you believe. I'll just stick with RainX. It actually does what they say it'll do. If this spray is anything like the wipes, I'll pass."
2,Totally ineffective on water spots.,"I purchased this at a local auto parts store because it claims to make glass ""Invisible"". My auto glass has severe water spotting and the product didn't even phase it. For general usage, it is no better than the generic window cleaners you find in the dollar stores, and is much more expensive."
2,good intro to Ashley's music,"Ashley's a good pop singer, but she's got such a beautiful voice that it would be great to hear her sing other types of music as well. Nonetheless this is a good intro to her music, and be sure to buy her cd Get In The Booth."
4,One Major Club-Banger,"I remember coming across this single at a downtown record shop and decided to purchase it due to the reading of the liner notes on the reverse cover. As I play the disc and the simple melody comes in, I think to myself that this is just another ""bubblegum pop"" tune. But I was blown away big time when the beat kicked in. This is no way a ""bubblegum pop"" tune. Better yet, this is not the typical pop tune. The beat gives the tune a major street edge and it also has the flavor to bang in clubs. Although this single is five years old, it's still hot today and I urge anyone to cop this."
3,hottie is not the best.,"ashely ballard's 1st single ""hottie"" is not good.the song ""hottie"" is horrible and should not of been the 1st single. 5x5 is great and that should been the single.it sounds like a janet jackson song.the other clips are ok but this is not the best cd single i've heard of."
3,hottie is not the best.,"ashely ballard's 1st single ""hottie"" is not good.the song ""hottie"" is horrible and should not of been the 1st single. 5x5 is great and that should been the single.it sounds like a janet jackson song.the other clips ok but this is not the best cd single i've heard of."
2,No subtitles,"I liked this film but would have enjoyed it much better if it had english subtitles. It is clearly a propaganda film that shows Mao as a happy man who cares for everybody, nearly the exact opposite of real life. It has some interesting scenes of Chinese daily life. Credits include a few italian film makers, so maybe the Chinese had some help putting this together. In some ways it was interesting to see a staged color film of Mao (an actor) rather than grainy black and white images. A lot of extras were used to show the fanaticism around Mao."
4,Fascinating College Years Memoir,"Da Chen writes about his college years at the Beijing Language Institute. Although the story of the naive countryside dweller moving to the big city is an old one, but Da Chen makes this story fresh and entertaining. However, Beijing at this time was still quite backwards compared to Western cities or even Beijing of today, yet the gap with rural life at that time was already enormous. The hurdles of getting used to all the novelties of college life, dealing with the arcane and corrupt communist rules, and the drive to earn a scholarship to go to the United States all make for an engaging story."
3,Sounds of the River,"I loved Colors of the Mountain so much that I was determined to read the story of how Da Chen spent his universities days. I wanted to find out how he managed to painstakingly crawl his way up to read English and then go on to America for Law.However, the way Da Chen led his life as a University student disappointed me very much. I believed it was only through sheer hardwork that got him to the top. Having led a politically-incorrect life in his childhood, I thought he would be a very upright person in refusing to practise bribery when he grew up. But I guess that's the way how it was in China in that period.I wish I never progressed any further from Colors of the Mountain..."
3,Disappointing -- Fictions outweigh facts,"I enjoyed the first book ""Colors of the Mountain"" so much that I regret to have read this one. Although might be inaccurate in some small details, the touching/inspiring story told by Colors of the moutain is overall believable. A lot of dialogues and events in this book, however, are simply too outrageous to be possible. Seems the author tried too hard to win the readers by making these unbelievable dialogues and twists. In so doing, nevertheless, the story lost its credibility. I also found the protaganist became disappointingly not-lovable. You can't BLAME a person who plans every second to get self-advancement. However, you won't like him and unfortunately this book is pretty much about this kind of self-struggling."
5,Simply stunning,"The book has stunning photos that truly show the birds as they would be seen in real life. The use of mini ""quizzes"" throughout the book set it apart from other books like it. The book is a learning tool vs. only a reference tool. The descriptions are easy to follow. The range maps are clear and the layout is easy to understand. This is the birding book of the year."
5,Very helpful,you can never get enough info/descriptions/photos/drawinsg to help with the difficult IDs of shorebirds along the shores of Lake Erie. this book will be my companion whenever i am shorebirding (along with others). recommended!!
3,"The title should be ""NORTH AMERICA Shorebird Guide"".","This was supposed to be one of the best bird guide I have ever owned....superb pics, outstanding approach and information, including sub-species info!The only problem is that I was expecting a COMPLETE World Guide, with all 217 species of shorebirds. The title makes you to believe it is a complete guide!Unfortunately, it is totally addressed to a North America audience (inclusive the maps!).Species like Charadrius falklandicus and Charadrius modestus are totally ignored for instance. I'm quite disappointed..."
4,The shorebird guide,Excellent pictures of shorebirds in various plumages. Helps with ID in the field. Good descriptions of behaviors also.
2,disatisfied,I expected larger pictures so more detail could be shown. Very dissatisfied but will probably keep because shipping and returning would be a hassle!
5,Essential reading on the sublect,"Vito Russo's seminal work on representations of gay and lesbian people in motion pictures is an essential read for anyone interested in the subject. Russo's research is exhaustive for the period he covers, and his perspective sheds valuable light on the ways in which art and media both reflect and construct our identities. Excellent."
2,Bored me.,"If there was a point to this book, I didn't get it. It was boring. I never finished the book because I thought it was a complete waste of time."
5,One of my favorites,"Love it. And it was a great deal, great seller.I would buy from them again but if you love Loretta this is a great Dvd about her life."
2,"well,we dont have any better",The book trying to be in the middle of everything.And no entry on homeless people.Sure we dont have homelessif they are not in the book.Hard to figure out quality ofour life but its not the book purpose.Plenty of uselesstables.
1,Don't waste your money,"While it is a real prada, it looks and feels extremely cheap. It is also very small. The best way to describe it... you know when makeup counters like clinique or lancome do free gift time and they put products in those little makeup bags, that's basically what this looks and feels like. A cheap makeup bag with the prada logo slapped on it.Mine also arrived stained.If I could give this bag 0 stars I would."
5,benefited,This is very useful for both diagnosis and then explanation and application of manual techniques for treatment.
1,Historically inaccurate,The author makes clear that this is a novel but claims that it is based on fact. A glaring problem here is that the unit to which the central character belonged was no where near some of the battles in which the story has the character fighting. There are other nagging historical errors throughout that great distract from the book.
4,"If this isn't EZ for you, then","Burned my father's LPs and created CDs for him. When he first played em on his CD player, the look on his face was priceless. While some major scratches won't clean out completely, you can still get a cleaner playback. For those that aren't savvy enough to figure this out, I suggest selling your computer and investing in an Etch-A-Sketch."
1,"anything but ""EZ"" audio","Despite following the tutorial and walk through and reading the skimpy little ""manual"" countless times I simply cannot get this program to do anything!!! I have all the cabling and connections needed it just will not record, much less clean up anything. Total frustration and waste of money. I'd give it no stars if possible."
5,"Another wonderful ""Little Britches"" book by Ralph Moody","My husband, grandson, and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to the Little Britches series and this book was no exception. I personally think every child in school should be required to read this series in hopes they would have a better understanding of how hard work pays off and what hardships our ancestors had to go through just to be able to feed their families. Too many children today graduate from high school thinking they should be able to have and live the same life style as their parents who have worked hard to get where they are and to have what they do. I thoroughly recommend this series for parents and children alike and even better it is wonderful to listen to it together with your children on a long road trip."
3,Letters from WWL2M book,"The book arrived on time. The status of the book was not what I expected. I thought it would be in better shape even with some pages torn out. It was really old, caught me by surprise."
2,not as pictured,"disappointing. overly shiny and is adjustable--that may be in the description, but i didn't see it. And though i decided to return the ring, Amazon's return policy made it extremely easy, and best of all--return shipping is free! Thank you, Amazon, you rock!!"
4,Decent boot socks,"If in the military I would have to wonder if these socks would really hold up as they don't seem to be constructed solidly enough.However for my purposes as a civilian who wears boots, I LOVE these socks. Very comfortable, plenty long (they go up to the knee, so I often fold them down lower), and has excellent moisture wicking properties. Also has looser fabrics above the toes so that they can ""breathe"". It's a cool feature, but it's also why I say they'd make bad boot socks for military personnel (in harsh conditions I imagine this thin fabric would rip).Recommended for most."
1,Under Armour Socks GREAT Product,Under Armour is an Excellent product. Bought 3 pairs of socks for Christmas presents... The material works just as described...perfect.
5,Samuel,"As usual, this commentary provides insight to understanding the books of the Old Testament. Wiersbe provides cross-references between various books in the Old & New Testament and provides unbiased views. If your looking to better understand 2 Samuel and 1 Cronicles, read this book as you study the KJV Bible."
5,Great book for the basics,"My client wanted to have a blog and I needed to learn the basics about blogs in short order. This book is a quick read and I was standing in front of their executive board in 1 week with a customized sample blog in place for their review and questions. I received a signed contract that day. Thank you for this book. On the down side, the specific blog software I used was not included in the book for review. Marketing was an important topic in my meeting and the book provided a nice, simple layout on the differences with other media and provided great ideas. The corporate blogging topic was helpful."
2,Good for someone just starting out,"I got this book thinking that it could help me with my exisiting business. I would say that I'm pretty knowledgable about blogs (which are popular, how to read them, where to find them, how posting often helps increase the hits, etc). This book covered everything I already knew in one place. So if you know what I know and a little more, don't waste your money with this book. If you are completly new to blogging, this is a good foundation."
3,Fast read | Good for readers unfamiliar with the Blogsphere,"If the word ""Blogsphere"" is completely foreign to you, you will find this book to be a good introduction into the world of blogging. If you've created your own blogs in the past (using Blogger or some other tools), then you may benefit from something a little more advanced."
3,Expensive for paperback,"Good info and starts with the basics, but in smaller print and a smaller book, would have been less expensive. Offenders and their families cannot afford treatment; therapists must reduce costs. No reason for this to be so expensive."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Found this book after much searching. Am working with client's who's spouses/partners sexually abused others. There is little data and information available for counseling this population. This is a great text chocked full of helpful information for the therapist to guide the ""other victim"" through this painful experience."
2,Two books. Tomus Prior and Tomus Alter.,This is only ONE of a two book set. You need both or you only have prayer for part of the year.
1,Ignore the Other Reviews - Do Not Buy This Book!!,"This book was the worst. Calling it a book is laughable, since it's the size of a pamphlet - 120 pages! Two-thirds of the book was autobiographical and had no useful information at all. The rest of the book had all of the same tips that you usually find in these type of books, (e.g. save money, only buy items used or in bulk, contribute to your company's 401k, etc.) And there were actually two chapters devoted to buying a car!If you are looking for a good book on getting out of debt, buy any or all of the Jerrold Mundis books."
2,No New Info,This was a disappointment. I expected some new ideas or at least a guide to resources but all I got from it was get a better job and pay your debts off as fast as you can.I think my own father would have been just as much help.
1,Feeling ripped off,"After many sleepless nights worrying about how I will ever retire with my current debt structure and absolute lack of any savings, I began researching the subject.The title caught my eye, as it's my predicament too. I thought I would get some sage advice or at the very least a few tidbits to get me on the right track. Unfortantely, this book does not deliver. I already bought a new car. The old one cost over 7,000 a year to maintain. It was a Volvo. I have no access to a 401k.The book is just worthless and a waste of my money. I see the only way out is to self-publish. At least I've done enough investigating to see what a person must do. I suppose I could now publish a worthwhile book explaining what we can do and more importantly, how.If I could have given 0 stars, I would have."
2,Was rather pointless,"I ignored the other reviews and bought this book, (used thankfully). I was thinking it might be a good easy read and place to get started on how to get out of debt etc as I was a bit intimidated by the huge Orman book I'd been looking at. Well, it was indeed an easy read...but um, there was very little actual content. Fluffy fluffy fluff stuff. The advice was just very high level generalized common sense type stuff, like don't buy a new car (duh!), buy things used, put money in a 401k etc, and..clip coupons..really?. Heck, I probably could have written this book and I am not remotely a financial expert of any kind. I give it 2 and not 1 only because it was somehow kind of enjoyable, and well laid out..but as to actual helpfulness..nope not really."
3,"Funny, but at this price?","Cooper definitely gives you some ""poetry"" that can leave you holding your sides. Each verse is just a couple lines long... Each verse is accompanied by colorful drawings of a somewhat abstract nature. (Most of the book is actually the drawings.) In general, this might be a great gift for someone with a good sense of humor, and who can appreciate the underlying story behind each verse. I'm just not sure that you're getting what you pay for at this price."
5,A Bright New Look,"Here's a bright new look at life in the lavender fields. I saw a copy at a friend's house and ordered one for myself. Whether ""Luther in Leather"" or ""the Speedo on Guido"" it's a light, telling look at the things good and funny about a gay life. I recommend this book as a gift, or for yourself, or, if you're brave, for you with-it grandparents."
3,"Five Stars for Montaigne, One for Screech","Over the years I have kept a copy of the Essays by my favorite reading chair to be enjoyed at random, particularly in the middle of the night when Entropy seems to hold the upper hand. They exercise a remarkable calming effect.Seduced by the idea of having a complete set of all the Essays, I initially opted for the complete Screech translation, but found it wooden and pedantic. I moved to the Cohen translation, which does not include all of the Essays, but has all of the major ones and is far more enjoyable."
5,The Kings and Queens of England and Scotland,"THIS is a very fun book...written like no other I have purchased on the royal'sand I have several. It has a lot of pictures and it has condensed informationat one side of the two pages per person/place it's talking about. Very interestingway to write about history, and easy to pick up and read a few pages at a time, asthere is no 'story line' to really follow, it really is a fun book."
5,My wife's cousin is now the drummer for this great band!,"Palomar is truly a great band - fully of catchy, angular, pop punk tunes. Every song rocks - it's the kind of music that you can't seem to get out of your head. And I'm not saying that just because my wife's cousin (Dale W. Miller) is now the drummer. Frankly, the bands that he's previously been in have been hit or miss for me. But he really landed in a good situation this time. I believe that Palomar is destined for big things. They kind of remind me of Elastica or the Breeders. Get this album, enjoy the great tunes (especially Knockout & the cover of Eno's I'll come Running), & watch out for their new album, coming out soon!"
5,BUY THIS RECORD!,"This is a great band and you should buy this disc! The first thing that struck me about this CD is that there is a lot going on in almost every song. This is a band that really plays together. The interplay between the instruments and voices is incredible. The lyrics are great; no matter what the story, it is told in interesting and intelligent terms. The disc starts with several very fast, energetic songs, but if you don't like them, just wait a few minutes - there is always something different on the way, including several fairly down-tempo songs that are among the best on the record. The cover of Eno's ""I'll Come Running"" is suitably bizarre and wonderful. The last song on the disc, ""Can't Wake Up"" is a great song that comes to a rousing conclusion fitting for the last song on the disc. Overall, this is a great record, and if there is any justice, this band will get the larger following it deserves."
5,"Palomar = Totally rad, like to the max",Palomar II is chock full of awesome goodness. Buy it or live in regret for the rest of your sad and lonely life. Seriously. Stop being lame and just love Palomar already. Sheesh.
3,Interesting insight into local history.,"Although I read this book several years ago, I have not forgotten. This book gives a very interesting insight into some of the not so nice history of the area. It does describe it all in great detail and draws you into the compelling story. It's a story that I'm sure a lot of people in our area would rather forget. But it did happen, and I think it's an important story for local people to read and know."
1,broken after 2 months,"I bought the rack, used it less than 10 times and now it is broken and I'm not getting any help from the manufacturer. When it worked I loved it, maybe a little harder to get the bikes on and off, but for the money it was great. I had one of the mounting bolts that secures the bike to the rack freeze up. The nut it threads into is hidden inside the rack and can't be accessed and the only way to remove the bike was to cut the bolts with a hacksaw. Now even using screw extractors and long handled pliers I still can't remove the stuck bolt. After contacting the manufacturer with my problem I was offered the opportunity to purchase a replacement bolt for $5 plus shipping, and payment can only be made by paypal...no help on how to remove the bolt or an offer of replacement."
1,Bad batteries!,"I was putting these batteries into a tv controll and I dropped one and it fell into a pond by my house because for some odd reason I was outside, nearly 50 feet from my house. Well anyway, I picked it up and put it into the controler and now it doesnt work!!!! I am so mad!! Like this smiley!!!! >8("
3,the keys are a little spongy,"not a solid hit, hard to explain, but the keys almost bounce was not all that easy to install, but all keyboards install the same way,"
5,an easy and practical table,"i am using this table outdoors for my indoor, frost tenter plants, which take a summer vacation from the house, i used pressure treated 2x4's...i will put on a coat of stain, if it ever stops raining.this table is easy to put together, if you can cut a 2x4, and sink some screws... predrilling the screw holes makes the job easier..."
2,"Great idea in theory, see below:","Build your own patio furniture. While this sounds like a great idea, be mindful of the costs involved and also the longevity of the product.[...]Total cost: [...]- assuming you make no mistakes; and that the cost of the 2x4's are in this range. The problem I have with this is two-fold:1. 2x4 studs are not weatherproof. In time they will warp and crack and turn color. I would not consider pressure treated for obvious reasons and anything beyond that (Cedar, redwood or even the composite-plastic boards are phenomenally expensive). At that point, the price of this project will rival your aluminum patio tables.2. Maintenance - you will have to stain/weatherproof each year. These are added costs in maintaining the item.SUMMARY:Nice idea in theory. I love building things, however, save your money and INVEST a bit extra in an all aluminum patio table that will last a long time and not need continual maintenance."
2,Avril the Whole Picture - missing 8 years .,"This is advertised as covering Avril Lavigne 10 year career . However it only covers 2001-2002 . It has nothing mentioned past the First Album and only briefly mentions plans for a 2nd album . There are no current photos or videos and NO Avril music at all . It has persons who look like Avril playing and singing , but not Avril songs . It does have an annoying background soundtrack that is nothing like Avrils music. All the interviews about her shown you have already seen before . Such as her High School principal , Pizza Shop owner , neighbors , early record company employees etc . If you are looking for original Avril material you won't see it on this DVD ."
1,no singing,"I ordered it without looking deep into the contents of the DVD, I love her work but the drawn out discriptions of events without not even a single entire song, was not for the normal music lover"
2,"Nice concept, poor execution","This product is a bit clunky. The top snap is on the back side of the unit which makes it less than convenient to access. When the phone is removed from the holster, the flap just hangs sloppily. The fit was especially tight too. I have the original LG Chocolate (VX8500) which is a little bigger than the later version, but it claims to be a fit for the original. The belt clip places the phone a bit farther from the hip than I care for too. It makes it hard to detect a call when on vibrate mode. The one good thing is that the screen is visible. That's important when I'm driving my motorcycle and I can't hear it or feel the vibration. (yes, I pull over to take the call, but I don't miss any calls either)."
2,"Does some things great, others not so much...","The craftsmanship is great. Sturdy leather and snaps with a firm click clip. Clip must be pressed to remove, which seems like a hinderance, but is good so it doesn't come unclipped by mistake.Unfortunately, the light buttons on the front of the phone are unresponsive when in the jacket. Also, you must unsnap the plastic cover to slide the phone open! That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case). With the jacket on, receiving calls is not a problem, but to access the menus and other functions that require the phone to be slid open, you must unsnap, then slide. Yuck!!!!"
3,not too good results,"It says that it keeps your face shine free all day,but actually it didn't really worked for me."
3,Recycled plot still works,"It's the same story as in Buck Jones' ""The Texas Ranger"" (1931), Tom Keene's ""Come On, Danger"" (1932), George O'Brien's ""Renegade Ranger"" (1939) and Tim Holt's ""Come On, Danger!"" (1942) in which a lawman goes undercover to bring in a female bandit leader, only to find she's been forced into outlawry by a crooked tax collector and change sides. This time, Sunset Carson is the lawman, Peggy Stewart the lady outlaw and Roy Barcroft, the villain, an great trio from Republic Pictures -- although it has nothing whatever to do with Billy the Kid."
5,Sony DVC Cleaning Tape,"Item arrived yesterday and this morning I took my Sony camcorder out and used the cleaner tape on it. This camera previously was purchased through Amazon.com and when it arrived it was not recording to the tape as advertised. I had been so pleased with the performance of the camera that I decided to go the extra mile and order this cleaner tape to run on the Camera. Well, after 10 seconds of cleaning, I inserted a new DV/Mini tape into the camera and recorded the first time on it. I was amazed that the recorded images were just as pristine as my newer camera. I am glad I did this before asking to return the camera. Sony makes great products."
4,works Great,the video in my sony camcorder started getting blurry and fuzzyso i tried this cleaner and it solver the problem. video is perfect now!
5,"Get this right the first time, right here at Amazon!","If you need this item, Amazon is the place to get it, at the best price even when you factor in shipping. Compare prices at your local stores and you'll know what I mean."
5,Head cleaner cassette works,"Although tape may seem to be dead or dying with the advent of flash and hard drive memory cameras and systems. The use of DV tape is still alive and well and still used in the professional industry. This Sony head cleaner cassette is an asset. And is best with Sony camcorders, DV player/recorders and other camcorders. We use this cleaner when tapes have been sitting for some time and could cause head clogs from the oxide flaking off. So Keep one on hand to be prepared. Sony makes a great product."
5,A must have,"Great product! A must have for any mini dv camera or deck. Using different brand tapes (ie: Sony, Panasonic, JVC) will quickly clog mini dv heads because the material of one brand of tape attracts the material from a different brand of tape. If you only use one brand of tape in your camera or deck you won't be needing this Head Cleaner very often, but if you are like me and end up using different brands of mini dv tape you really should do a quick 5-10 second cleaning in between tapes to prevent digital gack & error messages. It's well worth it and seems to last a long time."
5,Works good,"This cleaner works very good, I was used approx 5 times all the tape and clean good the heads.I recommend this product 100%"
5,Great! Better than the Panasonic,"I bought the Panasonic one at a local store. When you open it, the instructions say don't use this to clean your heads unless your picture quality is already suffering. Yikes!The Sony product can be used before your images start suffering."
4,It`s a Sony!,"Not really used it as yet. But friends who used and recommended this to me, say its great and worth investing in."
4,It is what it is .,"I utilize my camera more than it apparently is manufactured for. So, the problems most woould get after a couple of years, I've gotten within six months. The cleaner helped eleviate some of the issues I was having."
4,Gran cantautor,"Si le gusta la música de Silvio Rodríguez y Pablo Milanés, le va a gustar. Beautiful music in Spanish with profound meaning."
5,"Objective, hard science","Extremely well written document on a powerful alternative theory on AIDS. I hope the orthodoxy can swallow this medicine and take hold of this information from an objective viewpoint without any hidden agendas forced upon them by pharmaceutical companies. Unfortunately, that probably won't be the case. It's refreshing to see some people taking a stand for the truth in science. Great work!"
5,A Breakthrough Book,"""AIDS: A Second Opinion"", by Gary Null is a riveting read. It was good to know that in this world of major medical mistakes, a misdiagnosed health condition can take on a gigantic worldwide public relations myth but that Gary Null has had the courage, along with a small group of respected scientists, to boldly write the facts. Now, we are finally one step closer to solving the mystery of a dreaded weakened body condition."
1,bad advice,"Gary Null's book on AIDS is dangerously out of step with the scientific evidence on AIDS and AIDS treatment. I would hope that no HIV positive person would rely on Null for treatment advice. Before spending money on this book, please read Peter Kurth's review of it on salon.com. Heck, even reading about the book on Gary Null's own website will scare off many people. Null's site makes it clear that he is a long standing AIDS ""dissident"" who has a far from unbiased view of his subject. I recommend you follow Null's own advice, quoted from his site: ""Note: The information on this website is not a substitute for diagnosis and treatment by a qualified, licensed professional."""
4,Perfect!,"I love this shampoo! I have fine, oily hair in great quantities and it's hard to keep clean. With this product my hair comes out naturally shiny, without needing shine serum. I'm going to stick with this product. I condition with a Biolage detangling solution. My only issue is that as with every other shampoo out there, my scalp still is rather itchy."
3,the product seemed diluted,the product was not easy to discern from other biolage hair care products. The product seemed diluted from past purchases.
3,Ok shampoo,"Since I live in a humid area my hair look oily, dirty and heavy after just one day, so I decided to buy this shampoo. It smells nice and cleans the head very well but my hair was still heavy and oily after one day.. For the price of this shampoo it is a little bit disappointing,"
4,Excellent,Love it. I love this shampoo. I received it very quick. Reasonable price. I Can see me ordering this again.
5,Perfect Clarifying,"I have very long, very straight, very flat, unstyled and uncolored hair.This is excellent as a clarifying shampoo. It's not meant for daily use for normal/oily hair/scalp and it's not meant for too-frequent use for normal/dry hair/scalp. I have an oily scalp with normal hair, and while my scalp was fine, even with conditioner my hair started to turn to straw within 4 or 5 days. It's simply too harsh for use on its own or for more than 2 or 3 times per week with most hair types. But for use once or twice a week it's perfect. All you need is a light conditioner and you're set. It has medium-bodied texture and is lightly scented."
4,Still waiting for full results,"Ive been using this shampoo for a few weeks now and I have noticed a little less oil in my hair but it's not helping fully yet. So Im still giving it a chance. When reading the other reviews about people losing hair, I can't complain there. I was losing hair before I started this shampoo and have actually STOPPED losing my hair from using this shampoo. Ive also learned to not use any conditioner now and just stick with the shampoo to help with my oilyness and so far so good."
2,Dried out my hair,"I read all the reviews and decided to try the normalizing shampoo. I've only used it a couple times, but each time I use it, it leaves my hair too dry. It makes my hair hard to comb through. I do have oily hair so I don't understand why it isn't working for me. I think it's due to the fact that this shampoo containes sulfates which I think I'm sensitive to."
3,"Product is great, but leaked during shipment",This product from Biolage is reliably good. I have been using it for almost 7 years now. There was a problem with the shipment as Amazon grouped this item along with a Gourmet Cookbook also ordered into one box. The shampoo leaked during transport all over the book which made it useless as the gift it was going to be. Most other sources ship the shampoo in shrink wrap packaging which from the appearance may originate this way from Biolage. Amazon only had the top tapped which did not seem to keep the cap tight enough to hold in the contents.
5,Sorting cone,"Out of all the toys I ordered off amazon for my 14 mo this is the one she liked the most. She hasn't figured out how to put it together yet but she was so fascinated that there were pieces ""hidden"" inside.The only concern I have is that the yellow topper is pointed and small enough to fit in her mouth, not small enough to swallow but I think it could get stuck pretty easily so I'm going to put that piece away until she's a bit older."
5,Love this stacker/sorter!,"My daughter is 15 months and I just got this for her. She loves it! From a parent's perspective, this is a wonderful toy because it's so open ended. The various pieces can be stacked, sorted, balanced, rolled, worn as bracelets, etc. It's very well made, too, I can tell it's going to last. We are very pleased with this one!"
5,Excellent Book,"I am from Oxford, and I still live there. This is an excellent book. It opened my eyes to what happened here in the past."
5,Black people suffered immensely,"very interesting, many bad things happened in those days. People in the North were not aware of the hatred in the South."
4,civil rights movement in small southern town,Was very interested in the book & felt that I gain information that I did not have before. Must read for anyone who has an interest in those times
3,Blood Done Sign My Name,I really enjoyed this story. This is a good read and is highly recommended. grab a copy today you not be disappointed.
1,A beautiful piece of FICTION,"I read this book for a college course and found it shocking and heartbreaking. I grew up very close to where the event of the story take place. After I had finished the book I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Tyson. This is when I began to become suspicious. I also met the offspring of people involved in the story. They, along with many other residents of Oxford confirmed what I already suspected. Much of this story is COMPLETELY MADE UP! Some of the events did actually happen, but are blown WAAAAAY out of proportion, and the means by which Mr. Tyson acquired some of his information are very shady. So my verdict: as a piece of fiction I think it's a beautifully tragic piece of fictions. As a ""true story"" this novel loses all credibility and so does Mr. Tyson for any of his other work and he should be prosecuted for his slanderous words."
2,fiction reported as non fiction,"As opposed to Tim Tyson, I have lived in Oxford most of my life and therefore truely know of the people, events, locations he supposedly researched extensively to write this book. This is a fictionalized account of an event. A black man was killed by a white man, but Tim Tyson doesn't know the truth as to what led up to it, nor the subsequent events. . I find it interested that the whites are depicted as ""terrorists"" and the blacks as ""military operators"".As I know that many so called ""facts"" are not so, (names, events, locations, etc.) I have to suspect the remainder of the book. The sad result is to question all books written by him and ALL graduates of the Duke PHD program. Tyson should advertise his future writings as fiction as he would make a good writer of the southern genre."
2,More fluff than interests,"Unlike the other negative reviews of the book, I have no idea if this is fiction or not. My frustration with the book was all the filler that made the book much longer than it should have been. Instead of getting to the murder, the fallout, and the trial...the authors goes into so much history at awkward times, it is hard to remember the issue at hand.The entire chapeter about his great grandfather Jack and the Gator had zero bearing on the story, and simply filled pages up with boring dribble to meet some magic quantity of pages. I almost put it down without finishing it several times.Oh well, it was worth a try."
5,The best history of the beginning of the Civil War,"This book will tell you more about how the Civil War got rolling than any other. It has all the characters a major novel will have, all real. If you want to know how things fell apart in 1860 and 1861, this is where to go."
4,Could have been better.....,"The album was good but could have been better.... There should be more songs spread out through the group. The stand out songs are Tina's ""Stronger"", Hannah's ""dance, dance, dance"", and ""It's alright"". Most of the songs are a little boring. ""NEver had a dream come true"" is the groups biggest single to date and it shows. The song is beautiful. Jo and the girls showed there vocal ability on this song. The best guy song on the album is Paul and Bradley's ""Summertime Feeling"".Over all the album is good enough to check out. Not as good as there 4th album ""Seeing Double"" or in america ""Don't Stop Movin"".C+ overall"
5,A wonderful picker upper!,"In my opinion, music is something to make you fell certain emotions. In the case of S-CLUB-7, I'm sure that they have set out to make their fans happy, and feel good about themselves! This album does that! I have all 3 of their albums. You can hear the group mature and grow with each release. All I can say is THANK YOU to S-CLUB -7, and their agents! As for a stand out song for the CD Sunshine, all the songs are excellent. But so far the albums title track is my overall favorite so far. If you don't have this CD, you are missing some true magic."
5,FANTASTIC!,"S Club is my favorite band, and this CD proved it even more. S Club is not like any other teen band. They are smart, sing well, and this CD has excellent songs!"
5,Sunshine - Sunny Indeed,"A lot of people have found the new S Club 7 CD ""boring"", ""repetitive"", and ""not as good as 7"". However, I like the new S Club 7 CD so much, I can't go a day without listening to at least four of its songs. Dont Stop Moving, Never Had a Dream Come True, Show Me Your Colours, Have You Ever, and You are all on my list of top ten favorite songs. If you don't have this CD, buy it NOW, even if you don't know anything about Rachel, Jon, Hannah, Bradley, Tina, Paul, and Jo. Their songs make you want to jump up, sing, and dance to their beautiful voices. Especially on this CD. Even if the new S Club TV Show sux, the music is peppy, upbeat, happy, and great.S Club 7's Sunshine is the CD you have to get."
5,"Baby, this album rocks","I recently ordered this album and love it, it shows a very mature S club 7, i=unlike their boring 1st album S CLUB, i dislike that one, but this is a gorgeous piece of art and everyone should buy it"
2,As described,the album came quickly and my young cousin was very happy with it. Although it's not my taste she was happy enough.
4,from what i heard...,Alright! Thhis cd rocks! but the first two songs are cheap. They are too high pitched or something. I don't have this cd. but used the amazon sampler. the rest is really terrific! S club 7 rules! :):):):):):):):):):):):):)
1,Can't believe,"I can't believe, I can't believe how they let this go on the market half of the album wants to make me puke. John Soper must be spinning in his bed. I hate pop"
5,S Club's Best CD!,"""Sunshine"" is S Club 7's best album. They are all talented, especially Jo & Tina. All of their songs are catchy.Stand-out tracks are ""Don't Stop Movin'"" ""Show Me Your Colours"" ""Have You Ever"" ""Stronger"" ""I Will Find You"" & ""Never Had A Dream Come True"".I love S Club's ballads like ""Have You Ever"" & ""Never Had A Dream Come True"", Jo's voice is strong, and I love the poppier songs too...I give this CD 5 stars because of the awesome tracks on this, but some of the songs are filler material. But I'm impressed with the majority of the songs on this CD. Definetly worth the money."
5,For Boxing Fans,"Co-authored by a former Welterweight Champion, basic boxing techniques: stances, punches, fight strategy, training, and equipment selection are covered well. A surprisingly candid discussion is included to guide young boxers in selection of manager and promoter...good buy."
3,So so...,"I really love White diamonds, and thought I'd like Diamonds and Emeralds too. But After a few weeks of use, I still long for White Diamonds.This is OK if you've never tried White Diamonds before, as it is cheaper than WD."
3,"OK If you are a believer in ""God""","This is a fairly solid work on Reiki and does give quite a lot of information (though not the symbols). The author is intent on keeping the subject under wraps and very ""religious"". He states with absolute certainty that Reiki comes from God - One wonders how he knows with such certainty what other Reiki masters admit to be unknown. I found his constant harping about ""God"" and his stating as absolute facts things which no person can know with certainty a little irritating. If you are of any religion other than Christianity I suggest you go for something less dogmatic."
1,garbage,I was expecting a full-size 8.5 x 11 and this is only a dinky little manuel - not nearly worth the cost of shipping - VERY disappointed!!!! Garbage!!!!
2,Reiki Book,"The book description listed it as new, but the copy I received was old and had notes in it. Very unsatisfied!"
2,Not really worth it,"It is so generic that it really isn't that helpful. Pass it up, there are much better books out there with more information that are a lot cheaper."
3,Guidelines for a beginner,"From the perspective of someone who knew absolutely nothing about ""Reiki,"" this book adequately serves as a means to get acquainted with the main particularities of this technique. As the author makes it clear, the correct and adequate application of the Reiki techniques should be done under the orientation of a Master, therefore implying that the reader should not rely exclusively on what is explained in the book (besides the fact that the necessary symbols have not been given). The structure of the book however, serves well as a teaching manual for those who are already familiar with Reiki and its applications."
5,A well-done ensemble piece,"Janeane Garofalo as one of the stars attracted me to this obscure little art-house film and, as she usually always does, Janeane proves herself to be one of the most compelling women in American cinema.But this movie surprises on many levels. All of the performances are very strong. Nikki Hansen and Tony Spiridakis are excellent. Giancarlo Esposito is transcendent as the street poet Karl. All of the characters are people that you find yourself interested in and pulling for.I highly recommend this fine ensemble piece. Expect yourself to be pleasantly surprised."
3,Very Good but not Great,"A well thought script with actors, for the most part, that can pull it off. If you like the kind of story that moves from three separate people/couples than you will definitely like this one. A bit mushy at the end but held together."
5,"Fast shipping, great movie","Came much faster than expected, despite the projected time being 2 months, I received my dvd within two weeks. It came as described, new, unopened and factory sealed. Was very pleased. The video itself is excellent, I bought it because I am a Pauley Perrette fan, and I wasn't dissapointed, but the rest of the movie kept me captivated."
5,MP 3 Download,"Some friends heard a song on the radio and wanted to hear more by these performers. I downloaded the songs into iTunes,burned a disc, and they were very pleased to receive the songs."
4,A great deal for beginners,"I have just bought this ""audio editing package"" as a part of my first video camera kit. I found it great because it contains all do you need to begin working on your digital videos, the software interface its very intuitive and very easy to use and you can be making things on broadcast quality very soon.The only complaint that I have, and the reason why I only assign 4 stars to this product, it's that the documentation is very poor (actually doesn't mention anything about the PCI card setup) and also I didn't find any help on-line to accomplish this task (neither in the websites of Sony and Pinnacle) .If you have a medium knowledge on setting up a PCI device within your PC and you are interested in begin video edition this product is for you. (By the way the only difference between this package and the D8 labeled it's the media tapes they have inside)."
3,Installation Problems,"This Sony software is actually made by Pinnacle Systems, and thus Sony's helpdesk will refer you to Pinnacle. Boy did I need help! The software came without a serial # required to install it, and it took me almost 8 hours with email, fax and phone with Pinnacle to get a serial #. The FireWire card supplied did not include the promised installation instructions, so I had ...[to] guess. Once I got the serial #, the installation went well, but Pinnacle's help desk is not an impressive outfit. Once installed, my Win XP PC instantly recognized my Sony Mini DV camcorder, and I downloaded my tape onto my hard drive with good intuitive controls."
2,Not what the picture advertises...,"I didn't actually buy this off amazon. But I got if from Hottopic. While it has a really neat design the zhoodie is made for people who have a small torso but a wide stomach. I am an average size gy 5'10"" 185lbs. I got a Large and it went almost to my belly button the sleeves went way below my hands and the extra room to stash whatever in the zhoodie with me. One unique quality is the zipper is on the left side. Most have them on the right."
1,hmhm BAD.,THIS SHOES FITS SO BAD IT IS PAINFUL. I WISH I COULD HAVE RETURNED IT THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I WORE IT. IT DOES NOT FIT LIKE IT LOOKS IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. THE STRAP RUBS THE BACK OF MY FOOT RAW.
5,"the book about his life, not his music","Others have been disappointed that this book doesn't discuss Elvis' music as much as his private life. But note the title! Taken this way, it is one of the best chronologies of his life. I have read. It was interesting to read it after having just read Guralnick's 2 tomes. In fact I was sorry Guralnick didn't have the latest info on Elvis' autopsy and cause of death. It is a great book for ""beginners""."
3,GOOD FOR BEGINNERS LIKE MYSELF,"THis is a steady and positive job of trying to cover the King's life in only one volume. The authors achieved their intentions, and I think the book gives us a great overall picture of ELvis, both in his professional and personal life. A good reading for anyone who loves rock and roll and wants to know its main character."
3,Well researched but not the best,"A lot of work went into this book, but it lacks objectivity. It is pro-Elvis, though not excessively so, but it seems entirely too kind to Dr. Nick and Priscilla.Dr. Nick no doubt curbed Elvis's overall drug consumption and minimized the careless peaks that would have occurred had he not been present. However, Dr. Nick was still party to the drug excess. It is difficult not to believe that his interest was primarily money at the expense of caring for Elvis. Despite receiving a hefty income, he found it necessary to borrow $200,000 from his very volatile patient. And then there was the racquetball misadventure resulting in legal estrangement. Still, I received a better appreciation for Dr. Nick's effort by reading this book. He did have a daunting task.As regards Priscilla, the authors seem to have bought the image she has been trying to project. Finstadt's book on Priscilla presents a more plausible picture."
1,Lebiram ed Ajrob,"Bad taste as most of the poor writers against the man and his huge musical talents. No matter how much they try to trash him he will be the One and Only forever. I wasn't a fan of Elvis before the 1997. Yeah, twenty years after his death! Then I started getting interested on him. Watched all his movies, read all or most of his books, and he captured, not only my heart, but my mind too! What a phenomenum! Incredible!"
1,Down at the End of Lonely Street,"Well, well, well, this book is not a biography of ELVIS is the everyday gossip of a Hollywood columnist as Pat H. Broeske. Don't know much about the other author Peter Harry Brown but to say it took them 10 years or research about Elvis and his career is just a joke. Very poor description of events and dates. Too bad I sepend my money on it."
1,ELVIS DIDN`T DESERVE A BOOK LIKE THIS !,"Elvis didn't deserve a book like this. It has only gossip, no music at all. We don't learn anything about rock'n roll history, only in the apeendixe there is an Elvis discography and fimgraphy."
2,PERSONAL LIFE OF ELVIS - NOTHING ABOUT HIS MUSIC,"This book real deals with Elvis'personal life, not his songs. THere's almost nothing at all about his few compositions, how he choose the songs to recording, who were his musicians, what were his techniques in a studio recording,hia ability with thu guitar, his favourite guitars, his favourite musicians as time went by, nothing! THere's only plenty of girlfriends, plenty of pills, plenty of nasty histories. If you're buying this book because you're a music (rock'n roll) fan, forget it. If you wanna buy it because you wanna know ELvis just like you hear about any other movie star, for example, then this is the book."
4,Johns got the Goods!,"Excellent solo outing from the chairman of Steppenwolf. John Kay has always been a rock and roll social conscious for the American ideal and he serves us up a great selection of thought provoking tunes on this effort. ""Sleep with one eye open"" will make you revist the past couple of years headlines and cause you consternation at the very least. It ranks up their with ""Monster"" in making us take a look at ourselves. Only this time, this song and the rest take a domestic and humanistic approach rather than the harsh look at US foreign policy. Overall this is an excellent CD that has a blues feel to it, and with the subject matter of John's lyrics it is a perfect match."
5,Perfect set - Quick Amazon Prime Shipping,Works like you'd think; good price -- Amazon is a juggernaut saving money and my TIME!
4,Literary Law Guide For Authors,"This book is extremely informative and insightful. As a lay person, I found the information to be in everyday language, written with clarity and provides all of the information I need. I took a copy along with me to my printer as I preparing to have my logo trademarked, and he was surprised at what he learned, and now he's going to purchase a copy for ready reference. As I progress with my own projects I expect to have a very tattered, and well used book on my hands. Thanks for this guide."
5,"Well-written, to the point and organized!","Literary Law Guide for Authors is my 'gold medal'. I treasure this well-written and VERY easy-to-read book! I've written (self-published) a children's book and currently writing a spiritual anthology. In both cases, I desperately needed contract forms and from searching the internet and communicating briefly with the author, I ordered this book. The forms section (in addition to the CD) included every bit of information I needed to create and provide a professional looking contract. I just can't say enough of this book. TIMELY. WELL-WRITTEN. INFORMATIVE.buy it!!!"
5,Beautiful Music from a Beautiful Person,"Well, if you've heard Al Petteway chances are you've heard Amy White (and visa versa). I got to meet Amy White when she and Al Petteway (with Bonnie Rideout) were in Oregon earlier this year. What a lovely person she is. Certainly, here is a rare blossoming gift that will be making fine music for years to come. Her music has the ability to bring you to one emotive peak to another again and again. Bitter yet sweet, mostly sweet..."
2,Does NOT work on Sap or bugs,"Ok, so it doesn't say that it works on bugs - I'm ok with that. However, it does NOT work on sap. Therefore, it does not perform as advertised. I've tried it on two vehicles that both had sap on them, and this product does not even make it easier to remove the sap. I don't know how it works on tar, but do NOT buy it for bugs or sap."
4,Hoodie for dog,"The hoodie was really cute, but snug for a large. My dog is 30 pounds and it is very tight on him, but he looks very cute in it."
4,Cool Sweatshirt,This is a nice sweatshirt. Well made from nice materials. The only problem was that the medium was waaaaay too small for my 25 lb. terrier.
1,Superchips 1705,"I wish I could write a good review regarding this product, but I can't. The only available unit I could buy from Amazon was a used one that was in ""very good"" condition. Everything worked fine including the error code that said the unit wasn't installed in the original vehicle. I have to send it to Superchips so they can re-program it for another vehicle. This costs $100 plus s&h, so my $250 Superchip will end up costing more than a new one. I wish Amazon had a new one when I ordered."
1,Read name very cartefully . Could be decieveing .,Wow did I mess up. I bought Dont Know Much c.d. for a Christmas present because I thought it read the songs were sung by Linda Ronsatd and Aaron Neville. Well it ACTUALY said MADE POPULAR by Ronstadt and Neville in small print just before the word Don't . It also said it was made for weddings. I guess it is alright for that purpose but PLEASE DO NOT ORDER IT THINKING IT HAS ANY VOCALS BY RONSTADT AND NEVILLE.I guess this goes in my never to be played drawer.sivled
2,Poor Production,"Some of the bloopers in this video were funny but so many were repeated later in the video two, three and even four times that it became monotonous. Most if not all of the bloopers are not from the major leagues. The worst part was that the video quality was so poor it made the experience unenjoyable and even painful to view. I bought this because the only review on the site gave it 5 stars. I think Amazon's customers are entitled to a second opinion."
1,Avoid this one,"The Hooker and Burgess translations are excellent. This one is dull, pedantic, pedestrian and boring. Very little of the wit and spirit of the Rostand original manages to come through. The two translators have taken one of the greatest plays in the French language and reduced it to rubbish."
1,Disappointed,"The hard bound copy of Cyrano de Bergerac that I received looked like bound xerox copies of pages from a smaller book. The page copies were faded at times, at other times, they had bands of darker ink across the page. The book pages were about 1/3 larger than the copy pages which were centered on the book pages. Truly inferior book copy, I have never seen anything like it. I am not a complainer. I have never written a review before let alone one that is so critical of a product."
1,Terrible translation,"This review pertains to the translation done by two women. I must say, this is a flop, some of the key words seem to be in French or translated into old English. My dictionary does not recognize many of those words. Instead, get the one translated by Brian Hooker."
3,Cyrano,"Cyrano is a man with an abnormally long nose but if you tease him about it, he will find a way to verbally get you back. A lot of people want him dead because of his attitude but they never succeed in a fight because Cyrano is an experienced fighter in the army. Cyrano loves his cousin, Roxanne, but she loves another man in the military with the name of Christian. Roxanne makes Cyrano promise that he will watch over Christian while they are away at war. Cyrano ends up writing love letters to Roxanne but signs them with Christian's name. Will Roxanne find out about who the letters are really from and how Cyrano feels about her?"
3,had to replace once already,"I bought this for my 6 year old neice for her birthday. Last year I bought her older brother the original and she asked for one too. When we looked it up online and she saw pink she was thrilled. At the time, just before halloween I looked for it at [..] and they didnt' have it. So I bought it at amazon for 40 including shipping. Well on the day of her birthday we just happened to go to toysrus and there it was for 25 dollars! Buy it at Toysrus. The original my nephew has been using for a year with no problems. This one started malfunctioning after a week. So we had it replaced. The replacements door has popped off. Go with the original."
1,This is junk!,The concept is great but the design and technology are horrible. The bills bunch up inside after adding just a few and then you have to open it and clear space for more. The password failed several times and had to be reset and then the whole thing stopped working despite new batteries and resetting. We had to pry it open to get her money out and my daughter was in tears.The company was quite rude and would not exchange for a new one. I would NOT recommend this at all.
2,Not what I expected.,My daughter lost her little plastic ATM card and she opens the small compartment door with a butter knife. Is very complicated for me to understand the machine. When you are adding money the machine gives all the wrong digits and amouts. otherwise the appearance is cute and pink but right now my daughter's ATM machine is sitting in the corner of her bedroom collecting dust.
1,TERRIBLE ITEM,THIS ITEM NEVER WORKED AND WHEN I TRIED TO GET IT RETURNED I HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
4,Girls ATM,"I purchased two pink ATM's for our twin 4 year olds and they love them. They moved all of their coin and $$ into the ATM's. The only issue they both had is that it tends to jam with wrinkled $$ although it is easy to clear, and you must open it, as noted in the instructions, after several bills have been inserted to move them over to the side. Capacity is also somewhat limited after a dozen or so bills and several hand fulls of coin."
1,not to happy about purchase,It didn't come with the card although any one works. It is really loud and not what I expected whnt to send it back!
2,8 years old & up,I bought these for my 6 yo. daughter & 5 yo nephew for Christmas. He broke the door off of his on the first day and the door on hers was broken within the first month. It is a good concept but no durable enough for younger kids. They both loved the idea but the construction was poor.
2,Wasn't the worst but far from the best,"I bought this book and could not wait to read it. It was a disappointment. It wasn't the worse book that I have read but it was not the best. I am the type of person, once I begin reading a book I don't stop until I am finish. This is the only reason that I completed this book. There were entirely too many typing errors. Ms. Hunter did not do a very good job developing her characters in my opinion. I also feel as though she left you hanging at the end. This book was a little better than 2 stars but not better than three."
1,You are Not alone? Please leave this book alone,"This book is boring and stupid. I skipped numerous pages and still could pick up with the story without feeling like I didn't read some important information. The reason being is because there are a lot of pages that don't list anything important so I skipped it. In other words pages of useless information. I would give this book 2 starts. Some things were ok but I wouldn't ever recommend this book to anyone else who loves a good read such as myself. My sister also attempted to read this book and stopped before she reached page 20. Every one is entitled to their opinion so you decide? But I didn't like it. I found myself rolling my eyes and feeling pressured to finish it. When I did I was more disappointed with the sorry ending just as the entire book. Read ""Saved in the City"" by Jacquelin Thomas now that is a good book."
4,Not So Quick To Judge.......But Give Praise,"There was so many mixed reviews, I had to read this one. I thought that it was a excellent way to portray four, strong, black women. I was not looking for the writer to educate me, so I didn't go into with those thoughts. I wanted to be entertained and Ms. Hunter did that. Congratulations, on your first book. Keep you head up. From one sister to all sisters, it starts and ends with you. This books says exactly what it's called. It lets women know they are not alone."
1,Ignorance to the race,"IF you have made the wrong choice of buying this book, then I advise you to put it down, and back away slowly. This book should not, nor ever be read by anyone. It is extremely insulting to my intelligence. Why? Because it wasn't written by an educated person. Everything the people said was predictable and completely cliche. This book should deserve an R rating, for its sexual overtones. We're in America, clean up your act."
2,WHO WAS THE EDITOR STEVIE WONDER?,"O.K. AFTER YOU GET PAST THE GRAMMER ERRORSTHIS BOOK IS A FLOPFOUR WOMEN HAVE ISSUES TO DEAL WITHTHE AUTHOR DID NOT DO A GOOD JOBCREATING A GOOD STORY1. THIS WOMAN IS DATING A WHITE MAN FOR THE FIRST TIMEAND SHE HAS A HARD TIME GETTING OVER THAT, THEN HER BABY FARTHER ASK HER BACK.2. NEXT WOMAN HAS A DRUG PROBLEM, IT TAKES SOMETHING TO GO WRONG FOR HER TO SEEK HELP3. THE NEXT LADY START DATING AN OLD CHILD HOOD BOYFRIEND WHILE ATTRACTED TO ANOTHER MAN THEN SHE ENDS UP HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE4. THE LAST LADY IS A LESBIAN WHO START HAVING FEELINGS FOR HER FIRST LOVE AND ACTS ON THEM THEN SHE HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE.NOW THIS IS A NICE PLOT BUT THE AUTHOR DID NOT BRING IT OUT TO WELL"
5,"Enjoyed it, A quick Read","There was a lot happening in this novel but it was understandable. I enjoyed this first published book and can't wait for the sequel, assuming there will be one. The language was easy to understand, it's like the author just wanted to get the point across and she did, not with all the extras. I say give it a try, after all it's only 14.00."
4,Either you love it or you hate it. I loved it.,"Before purchasing the book, I read the reviews and since they were so mixed, I decided to purchase it and give it a chance. What did I find? 1. It was a nn easy read, read it in one day. 2. If you're looking to be educated, it's not that type of book, it's a book where you are entertained. 3. I enjoyed it, especially knowing that this is a first time author and selfpublished. 4. I do recommend it. No, it may not be deep, but it held my interest."
4,Great Initiative,"After a hard day of work, I decided to sit down to read. I found your book to be most interesting because it gave me the opportunity to explore an unimaginable world of make believe. However, it also related to a realistic world full of secrets and really not knowing who to trust or in the end, how one would be judged. The women in your book took a leap of faith and trusted their inner most secrets with each other. There, friendships were formed and they discovered the foremost messsage of the book...""You Are Not Alone"". Continue to write with a message. (...) I truly feel this is fantastic book for a first timer."
1,"Sorry, It's a Stinker","This movie simply doesn't work on any level. No drama, no good one-liners, no worthwhile visuals. Nothing. Not even the ""so bad it's good"" consolation prize."
3,It has it moments,"An enjoyable science fiction movie, with better than expected acting, that builds up to a predictable series of events and a bit of a corny conclusion. Not bad for some afternoon entertainment."
5,Loved it!,I think this was ahead of it's time. Very well done and enjoyable!! Not blood and gore!! Which in my opinion adds to the appeal. :)
4,An Early Sci-Fi Channel Epic That Works,This is one of the early SyFy channel movies that actually works pretty darn well. I don't like going into plot points in my reviews so it'll suffice to say that they snagged James Spader for the lead and an excellent supporting cast including Keir Dullea (Dave in 2001 - A Space Odyssey) in a small role. From the era of Alien encounters this is one of the better efforts and is entertaining all the way. I'd recommend it over the current crop of SyFy Saturday Night 'B' movies by a mile. Grab it while you can.
1,Hunley Not!,"Here is an excerpt of my son's book report for this book: I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate this book. The author either talks down to you or uses fancy words. The cover exactly says ""Make It Three, The Story of the CSS H. L. Hunley, Civil War Submarine,"" but the book is about a boy who wants to learn about the Hunley! I would not recommend this book to anyone, except if I hated them."
4,Swappin Styles Kennedy,"Wow.First thing that I would like to point out about this doll is that her face is VERY mature looking.I`m not sure,but I think that her has ""real"" eyelashes.She also(I believe)has 3 different hairstyles and 3 different outfits.Well,this doll is really pretty and I wish that they had a picture of the doll in her box because it would be a big help to be reviewing this doll and for people thst are internet shoppers so it could help them make a purchace.But they changed Barbie1s name to kennedy and I`m not sure why.I guess(maybe)it has to do with Barbie being the name of a HUGE company."
5,We love Rosie,"I am an indulgent grandmother of a very enthusiastic Thomas fan. When he mentioned Rosie to me, I immediately looked her up on Amazon and had her on the way to him. He knew Rosie was in the box, even before my daughter finished opening it. When Rosie was released from her confines, he had to run get Thomas - after all, they are best friends. Rosie and Thomas slept with him that night and were brought to my house when he came the next day. Rosie is a terrific addition to a growing collection."
3,Doesn't fit Brio tracks,"I'm not sure whether this train is supposed to fit Brio brand tracks, but it doesn't. Because the wheelbase is so large (width and length) it constantly falls off the track. It's really frustrating."
1,Don't order from MY TOXBOX,"The company My TOYBOX sent me battery operated Thomas trains that did not work. When I contacted them they did not resolve the situation (refund, credit, exchange etc.)Stay away from this company."
1,This thing is Dangerous,This Platform is terrible. It is absolute overkill as far as technology...much too large and heavy. The installation instructions are pathetic. The color code operation is unintelligible. The worst part is that the clamp operation is downright dangerous. Release the clamp and it snaps down with industrial strength so hard it could break your fingers or maybe worse. I'd call this the Jaws of Death design...with no instructions about how to operate it safely. I didn't buy it from Amazon. I bought it elsewhere from an outfit that has a pathetic return policy (big mistake). I'd rather throw it away that deal with it.
1,DON'T buy it!!!,"The one I got is different from what we see on Kensington website! Even the model number is the same, but what the clip video shown on Kensington website is different! Please make sure if this is the right one you want!"
1,Because of the reviews I decided against this product.,Because of the reviews i decided against this product. Because of the reviews i decided against this product. Because of the reviews i decided against this product. Because of the reviews i decided against this product.
2,Why,"Why doesnt someone working with Keith release a better produced version of Mommy off cenobites. Its got me f#$ked why 1 of Keiths best tracks is available only on a rare poorly produced ep. Also alot of other Keiths best arnt on here such as Earth People off Octagon, Appartment 223 off Dooom, Make up your mind from Sex Style and Drugs off Spank Master. How someone could say that this is a mix of rare and best stuff is beyond me. Ive just named 5 tracks that should be on this. DJ Junkaz Lou. You obviously havnt taken enough acid."
3,exercise instructions only,"This book is a great review and description of several exercises to do. It does have a section in the beginning about choosing the right dress for your body type which was small, but helpful. There is absolutely zero useful discussion of food. However, the pictures and description of the exercises were pretty good. It is true that they require very little room to complete, but there is nothing new or unique about them."
2,a little blah,It was okay but I was looking for a little bit more. I don't feel it motivated nor gave good workouts to really get me in shape.
5,"Purchased as a gift, she loved it...",My friend who is recently engaged loves this gift... she uses it everyday and is excited about the workouts.
3,"Workout for the ""Big Day""","I purchased this book in anticipation of wearing my strapless wedding gown in June. The three month program located in the back of the book provides easy, step-by-step instructions for people who do not love and enjoy going to the gym. A good read and I have started the exercises!"
3,Okay Book,"This book would be great if the pictures of the exercises were next to each workout. When you go to the weekly workout, you have to flip to each exercise to see what it is. Since there are 10-12 different exercises to do in a day and so many different types of exercises, it makes it kind of a pain.Other than that, it has some good tips."
5,excellent book- great results,"My wedding will be in 4 months and I started this program 3 months ago. My arms, abs, and lower area have trimmed and firmed. In addition, the book has encouraged me to combine these exercises with cardio. I now exercise every day (from once a week before the program). I feel more energetic and confident come wedding day. I have dropped 10 pounds since I started the exercises. They are so easy to do, I even work out while I'm watching TV. I highly recommend this book and plan to continue doing the exercises even after I'm married."
3,Loved this book!!,"I recently discovered Joyce Livingston's writings and have fallen in love with everything I have read. This book was very touching, with good interaction between characters. However, the ending was very disappointing and dissatisfying. If not for this fact, I would have rated it a 5."
5,My favorite children's novel,I first read this when I was in fourth grade. My favorite book when I was a kid I made sure I'd read it every summer and several times in between. The plot and writing style just seemed to carry me away and let me imagine a place where I could partake in adventures too. I highly recommend this book to any and all parents for their kids.
5,"Great,","As a very fussy design engineer, I think this title is great. I enjoyed this title in 1963. If you don't like it - get a life."
3,book review for Gone Away Lake,"The story about the cousins who explore through the woods expecting all of the wildlife things, find out that there is a so called abandoned ghost town. They go there and find an old lady named Mrs. Cheever. She shows them the different things about the ""town"". This book is great for people of any age who like to read stories about different adventures! This book was pretty good!"
2,A poor copy of Miracles on Maple Hill,"It was a plottless story with few problems, and the ones there were could easily be solved. It was full of useless description and flowery language. If you want to read a good story about two children in the wilderness read Miracles on Maple Hill, by Virginia Sorenson. It's very poorly written and lacking in much."
5,"Mystery, Fun & Adventure You Don't Have to Be a Kid to Love","I first read this book at 11 or 12 and was thrilled with its re-release a few years ago. I've bought it for several nieces, nephews and young cousins and re-read it each time. The relationship between the young cousins and the old siblings is an enchanted, yet realistic one. Guaranteed to get even the most hardened youngster interested in reading."
5,Memories,"I loved this book when I was younger. I was a voracious reader, even then, but I was always drawn back to this one. There's a certain magic in it, a gentle sort of atmosphere that is certainly lost in today's children's fiction. I highly recommend it to those children who still have gentle souls and a yearning for good adventure, but I advise the cynical or brash to look elsewhere for reading material."
4,Great Tale for Adventurous Readers!,"As a child, I LOVED books that would take me away to a place like Gone Away Lake. I wish I had found this when I was ten because I'm sure it would have been one of my favorite books. Another childhood obsession? Finding places to fix up as clubs, forts, or any place away from adults. I suppose it is a sign of a child's need for independence. But, that is a great reason I loved the books like this one by Enright. Gone Away Lake is the story of children who go to visit their aunt, uncle and cousin for the summer, but stumble upon a hidden swampy lake that hasn't been occupied in years. As the author ofCamp Bug Juice: A Bookworm's Camp Adventure, I was inspired to write my own children's adventure novel."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I'm 12 and just finished the book today and was totally SHOCKED at the bad reviews!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have read Miracles at Maple Hill and I loved it and these books are very similar but in a good way, a very good way! I am convinced that all of the people who disliked this book were either disappointed because they rather idiotically judged the book by it's mysterious cover or they just plain old don't like to read happy books with happy endings or just don't like to read at ALL (which is beyond my imagination)!! I was supposed to read this for school but I started it early having nothing else to read and finished LONG before the date i was supposed to START it!So it's not a horror or a thriller, SO?!?!?! So it's not violent or action packed, WHO CARES?!?!?! It's sweet and fun and I read it for hours! It is one of the few books I could read again!"
5,This was my favorite book as a girl...,"I am now a teenager, and I lost my beloved copy of Gone Away Lake, I hope to purchase another one soon. This is a remarkable book. There is no violence, cursing, or crudeness, no non-stop action either but this story is fun and exciting. These two cousins find the adventure I always wanted to have and I was able to share with them the fun as I read this book. The characters are very well developed and believable and the plot is perfect."
2,empty plot - boring story,"The cover and the back led me to believe that there was something mysterious at Gone-Away Lake. I read this to my kids, and after about 50%, none of us could stand it any more. So, we threw it away.The book never went anywhere. It was just a series of short adventures for two kids at the lake.It's not a bad book - it just isn't interesting. It's not very well written, has no suspense, doesn't teach any particular moral or lesson. In short - it's chloroform for kids.Get something from Mark Twain, or Jack London, or C.S. Lewis for your kids."
2,Gone Away Lake has a Gone Away Theme,"At first the book looks like it will be interesting with numerous twists and turns. Alas, I found myself anticipating some type of conflict to arise between the characters, until the very last page. Nothing happens. The book can be quickly summed up in a few short sentences; Two children go on vacation. Stumble upon two old people who live in the past. The end. I was always taught that a good novel has certain components... and having some type of conflict happen to the characters was one of them. Although the author uses some great writing techniques (excellent metaphors and colorful vocabulary), her plot was doomed from the start."
2,One of the worst books I have ever read,"Gone-Away lake is definatly one of the worst books I've ever read. Elizabeth enright has created a wanna be adventure book that lacks a main plot and has to many stories of the ""old days"" at Tarrigo. If you like to read borring books this is the right book for you."
1,Gone-Away lake,"Gone-Away Lake wasn't very good, you coudn't get into the book ,and it woudn't leave you droowling to move on to the next chapter, I just hated the part that this book was so boring, there was only 2 good parts!! Mrs. Cheever,and Mr.Paton could have been way cooler, they where so boring,and lame. I really didn't like Gone-Away Lake."
4,Better Than Nothing,"I own a 1953 Marlin 336 S.C. Finding a hammer spur extension is next to impossible for Marlin lever rifles that are pre-1957. The Carlson's Hammer Extension was my only option. I did have to modify the extension by filing down a little metal inside of the hammer hole to ensure a straight and level fit (the Marlin hammer tapers a little at the tip). After this quick and easy modification the extension fit well. There is no movement after the install. I can not comment on durability yet, but I will give an update if any failure occurs. It is a good product but keep in mid, it is a ""universal"" piece, so do not expect excellent fit without slight modification."
4,Elidor,"This is a very interesting book and my son and I enjoyed reading it together. It was a bit scary at times so I'd recommend an older reading age, perhaps 9 or 10 at the youngest.The story itself was well put together and, like a lot of things in life, leaves us wondering what was going on in the part of the story we (and the main characters) are not privy to.There is some sort of closure at the end when the children get a glimpse of Elidor and return the treasures but I would have liked some closure at the end regarding the children and what happens later. However if you are reading this with your children it makes for a great creative exercise in imagining what would happen next."
2,It is not a book,Looks more like a poem book for middle school. doesn't have any meat in it. Just bullet points.
1,Don't order MINIATURE EDITION!!!!,"Miniature Edition is 2.5"" x 2.5"" in size and less then 100 pgs. There are only about 10 words on a page and if you actually consider reading it I personally guarantee anyone who sees you will be struck with uncontrollable laughter, and will never again consider your financial opinion legitimate.Don't waste your time or money, get the 'full' copy."
1,Bad Joke!,I believed I was ordering a small book of One Up on Wall Street but it is not the same book ...only same name and cover. Only contains key phrases...got burned and because it was only a few dollars with shipping didn't want to waste any time and more$ to send back...Don'ty be fooled!
1,Disappointing,The Kindle edition of Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Street proved to be the abridged miniature edition. This was not clear when I ordered it. It is useless.Such is not what I expect from Amazon and would appreciate a refund since I bought this 2 by 2 inch 95 page hard cover edition in Amsterdam as a curiosity for one euro.= = =
1,Not what I expected.,"I thought this book was an abreviated version of the full book, however this book is actually a miniture ~2inch micro-pocket version of the full book. Text is full size, thus it only contains a very few high-level comments. I was hoping for a boiled-down version, but got mini-me."
2,its tiny!,"i was expecting the full book, not the miniature edition. note: this is an abridged, pocket size version of the book."
4,Beware of the hardcover edition!,"Please disregard the star rating. I didn't want to bring down the overall rating of what might be a very valuable tool in it's paperback and original version by giving this edition one star. However, I would like to warn shoppers that the reviews following this hardcover edition do not actually refer to this book. When they say miniature edition in its description, they mean it! This is one of those tiny novelty pocket sized hardcover books which, incidentally, does not have 128 but 95 pages, with about 40 words per page. Don't make the same mistake I did, assuming that this was the same as the book in paperback of the same title."
3,This book is TINY!,"This is a tiny little book, which I didn't realize when I ordered it. It's a heavily abridged version fit into a size that's about half the size of a pack of cigarettes. You have to turn the page a couple times to finish reading a sentence.It'd make a cute gift for a recent financial-science grad to put on his desk at his first job, but I was looking for a book to read. Luckily I ordered ""Beating the Street"" at the same time and that was what I was looking for: a book by Peter Lynch on investing."
1,THE SMALLEST BOOK EVER,"This is a MINIATURE book. Literally. 3 inces x 3 inches, ""95 pages"" with 30 or 40 big words on each page. Ridiculous. I can't believe such a thing was manufactured."
1,Kindle version is not the full version,"If you are looking for the complete version of One Up On Wall Street, do not purchase this item. You want the most recent paperback version. The kindle version is only a few dozen pages long- its a bullet point ""cliff notes"" version of the actual book."
1,Sucker,The is a stupid litte book that measures 1 1/2 x 2 inches. Get the real book. Why name this stupid little thing the same name as the real book. What a ripoff. If I could give a zero star I would have.
5,Great start for the Amateur Investor,"This book is an excellent starting point for new individual investors, It gave me the basic fundation in investing principles, Great!"
1,"One up on Wall Street: How to Use What you already know to Make Money in the market, Miniature Edition",I did not realize that this was the miniature edition when I bought this book. I want to return it for a refund.
1,A GIANT OF AN INVESTOR-a minature of a book,"First time I was ever let down by Amazon. I've gone back a few times to look at the description of this item and have not seen it described as a little tiny minature of a very famous book. The book easily fits in your shirt pocket. It is filled with very important Lynch quotes, but it is very abridged. Not worth the time to return so I am 4.95 wiser."
1,MINIATURE BOOK - NOT FULL SIZE!,"Be careful, before purchasing this book, that you aren't ordering the minature version. You will be thoroughly disappointed when you receive 90 one inch pages with bullet points spouting lame motivation and cliched investing mantras instead of the 300 page, soft-cover, real Lynch book. Make sure you order the real book, or else you'll be stuck with a mini summary of the real thing (think of the mini books they have near the cash registers at book stores)."
1,IT'S A MINIATURE BOOK!!,"This book is a vague summary of the full size book by Peter Lynch. It's a perfect book for your bathroom, because you'll read cover to cover in 5 minutes. Not what I expected, since it fits in the palm of my hand."
1,Kindle addition,"Buyer beware! The Kindle edition of this book is not the full book! It is the miniature ""abridged"" version that is only about 30 pages long, even though it is not advertised this way in the Kindle store, and there is no indication given that you are not purchasing the full book.This version is nothing more than a list of bullet points that summarize the main points of the full book. As a ""Cliff's Notes"" of the book it is decent enough, but as a guide to investing it isn't particularly useful.Don't waste your money on this version. Buy a paperback copy, and be certain you are getting the full book."
5,Pretty cool,"Good item, but the medium was a little too big for me being a grown woman. I will be exchanging for a small."
2,Capture card crashed after one year...,"I bought this kit by March, 2004, and it crashed just after one year of usage. First, the captured video skips frequently, and later, won't capture any video at all. One year warranty expired just before the problems begun.I give it 2 stars because the editing software was very easy to use, when I could capture video with the capture card, of course."
5,The best that contemporary classical has to offer!,"I was absolutely blown away by Bond's last album, ""Shine"", yet somehow this new album, ""Classified"", still manages to top it! This album is a lot more dramatic than their previous work, namely the opening track ""Explosive"" and the fantastic ""Highly Strung"". In fact their last album ""Shine"" seems relative boring when compared to this one.OK, so they may have lost touch with their traditional classical roots but for me, this is not necessarily a bad thing. I suppose that's because I'm not really a true fan of classical music.If you're like me, and simply enjoy listening to good contemporary classical music then this is the album for you."
1,What?,"My friend owns this. I can't belive that these girls took the masterworks and made them into something so bad! Wow this is awful. Classical crossover from what I have observerd is for people who can't play the masterworks. They just sound stupid for electric guitar and others like it. they weren't written for these instruments just leave them alone. I am not saying don't imporvise, but this isn't improvising. Back in the Baroque period you were expected to improvise on people like Bach and Handel because they didn't think their music would last as long as it did. It wasn't till Beethoven when you were supposed to play it note for note. These people aren't improvising they are ruining the works"
4,Classic Bond,"Bond continues to produce beautifully orchestrated music that permits the listener to relax. Great for lowering blood pressure, reducing anxiety and otherwise use as superb background music. Is perfect to listen to while developing code or analyzing problems."
2,Carmen Get It,"Your first hint should be the cover.Four pretty women. Eight long legs. Zero instruments.Would you really buy or play this album if the cover featured four middle aged fat guys?You can kid yourself that this is classical music. But this is really t.A.T.u. for snobs.Oh, (...)It's a remake of a 1975 disco track by Silver Convention that hit #2 on the US charts.Buy the CD if you want, but don't kid yourself that it's great stuff. If American Idol was held for classical musicians, this act would be Ryan Starr."
4,CLASSified,"This CD is amazing, as are all of Bond's works of art. The inter-twining of Latin, Eastern-European, and other world music styles are blended into a sassy, full-bodied quartet (no pun intended.) These tracks are full of interesting exotic sounds which take you to places of wonder and exitement while listening. Bond is definitely one of the most interesting musical groups I've ever heard. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Declassifing Bond,"Four years after Bond hit it big in the Mainstream music world, the string quartet released CLASSIFIED. The album was a display of not only Bond members' talents, but their abilities to expand the genre of their music. The basis of Classical music remained, but Bond's sound became even more Pop/Dance oriented. For the track ""Fly Robin Fly"", the group even performed in more of a disco style. To perserve the elements of Classical art, more brass, horns, and percussion were added to the arrangements of Bond's pieces. Props go out to the quartet's interpretation of the Hungarian Rapsodies that they entitled ""Hungarian"", and to their version of a movement from Carmen they entitled ""Senorita"". This album shows how a group's sound can change over time to a better style than the one they had already mastered. CLASSIFIED is part of Bond's best work and a must have for any music fan."
3,Whats gone wrong?,"I have been a fan of Bond since seeing them perform Viva on the Classical Brits back in... must have been 2002 and Born is one of my all time Favourite Albums. Shine was also enjoyable, but there seemed to be a trend towards more ""background"" music in the foreground, than Bond.Now comes Classified and where are Bond? Great job Production Team, you put the girls so far down in the mix that we can barely hear them. Look, I don't buy Bond Albums to listen to how clever some producer has been adding overdubs and special effects. I buy Bond albums to listen to BOND! This is NOT a proper Bond album, even though a couple of the tracks are enjoyable (Adagio for strings, Explosion, Midnight Garden), but some tracks are just plain rubbish - Highly Strung is the worst! Where is Bond in this track????Sorry, please consign this experiment to the bin and go back to how you made music on Born."
3,Fairly unmemorable,"I am a big fan of the Bond girls. I play ""Born"" and ""Shine"" all the time, and never tire of them. That said, I was disappointed with their latest effort. Whereas before, I viewed them as classical with a little techno thrown in, it seems to me that Bond has become all techno with a smattering of classical. Instead of their instruments being the star, it 's almost as if the instruments are afterthoughts to the booming synthesizer beat. Some of the tracks on this CD are decent, but overall, I find it unmemorable. Perhaps with a few more listens I will come to love it as much as I do ""Born"" and ""Shine""."
3,They have done better,"I love Bond. Make no mistake about it. Their first two albums were incredible. You could hear their instruments, get into the techno, and enjoy an all around musical experience. ""Classified"" is an album that seems to go in the complete and opposite direction. It is loud, filled with techno/background noise, and the girls talents are lost in the mix. ""Lullaby"" is an awesome take on Cannon in D. The wailing woman in the background destroys the mood of the song and really takes away from the promise that is there. I'm so dissapointed that the girls went from classical with a twist, to a twist with some classical. I hope their next album is better than this one. Would I tell my friends to go buy it? I would let them listen to my copy, and make up their own minds as to whether or not they like the spin the group has taken. If you ask me, it was a wrong turn, and the next time around, hopefully, they'll ask for directions and get back on track.LittleBayou@hotmail.com"
2,"No, no, NO! BAD producer!","I'll get this bit out of the way first: If you just heard about Bond from a friend or you stumbled across them, look at their first album 'Born'.I'll admit, when I first listened to 'Born', I didn't dig the classical sound too much. The intros are slow-paced like real classical music, and the first really good song is on Track 5. But having listened to 'Shine' and now this album, I have to say I liked their original sound much better.There's so much processing applied to these tracks that the ladies have taken a backseat to a SYNTHESIZER BEATBOX. It's obscene, and totally incorrect to boot, for the real musicians to get tossed in the background while some skinny, pasty recording engineer gets to pile layer after layer of samples and synth and...whatever else they use, ultimately smothering both the ladies' skill and the classical songs they're playing.Don't buy this CD. Maybe you could go to their website www.bond-music.com and tell them to get their priorities in line."
5,very nice,"I can say these work well having taken them out in < 0 wind chill. They only slight negative is that the seams stick inward and are sort of thick. It doesn't bother me, but someone might find it irritating. They work even better with a thin liner glove inside (hmmm, toasty!)."
3,Speer adds some details...,"In this modest sized book, Mr Speer outlines a handful of incidents that give face to the cruel passions that the American Civil War evoked. Both Confederate and Federal share the blame in Speer's sampling - from the ""random"" execution of partisans, to the more diliberate starving of Confederate prisoners in Northern prisons, to Union prisoners being held amid bomb-out Charleston! A nice final chapter gives a brief overview of prisons - which I found to be the highlight of this very short endeavor. Those well-versed in Civil War studies may find little new, but the novice reader will, perhaps, be taken aback at what Speer reveals. I give Speer credit for ""naming names"" and showingthe purposeful role Lincoln, Stanton and Grant played to further the plight of those held in their charge."
2,Not What I expected,Insufficient detail. Not what I was looking to research about mistreatment of civil war prisoners but perhaps my expectations were too high.
1,Not the translation advertised; also abridged,"This is not the translation advertised in the description; it is an older translation. Also this version is abridged, which should be noted in the description. If you're looking for a complete translation, this ain't it. :("
1,Don't buy this,I was disappointed that this contains only a few chapters. The translation is not as good as the Seidensticker version. I would not recommend this product.
2,A Lie to Readers by the publisher,"I don't like books that are misdescribed. This Dover version is NOT unabridged. the entire second half (after Genji disappears) is removed. All the poetry, too, is gone. No wonder it so inexpensive."
5,Fantastic book,"I love Japanese literature so I may be a bit biased, but in my opinion this is definitely one of the finer books out there."
3,The most boring book I have ever tried to read,"I couldn't read more that about 350 pages. They were all about how Genji was the most handsome, how he was best at some musical instrument, and how his wife stays at home while he has fun at other places with other women.3 stars because the book is easy to read and the quality of the covers and the paper is great."
1,Not for me,I had to read this book for class. It wasn't that good. Conversations get confusing because its not clear who is saying what. It might be a small book but its tedious reading. I'm usually a fast reader but it took me a couple of days just to get through 3 chapters. I asked around at class and found that I was not the only one who had this problem. Its less painful if you just get a summary or if you just get someone to tell you what happens.
1,Kindle Edition is NOT the Waley Translation,"This Kindle edition is a translation by Kencho Suematsu, NOT Arthur Waley, and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to read The Tale of Genji. There are far far better translations available. The Kindle version is falsely labeled, in my opinion."
3,Confused,"At first, I found this film rather slow but ended up quite gripping. And then it ended. It left many unanswered questions that really would have made this a deeper, more substantial film. While I enjoyed the film, it could definitely have been less mysterious than it was. I would likely have to watch it again to see if I missed something."
2,"Twins, Priests,Nuns,Murder,Cover-Up,Lies and Truth","THE PACT OF SILENCE is a much ado about nothing film. Starring Gerard Depardieu as Father Joachim and Elodie Bouchez in a dual role as twin sisters Sarah and Gaelle, Graham Guit's directed ""thriller"" is really a slow moving build up and unraveling of clues that, once you get to the conclusion, you just say ""What's the big deal?"" and move on. Two of my favorite actors in one pretty dull film that tries to be sophisticated and unique, but ultimately is neither and seems intentionally confusing to no point. No recommendation. No DVD special features. Unenlightening commentary."
4,identification,"Just to clear up some confusion about the ending of Pact de Silence: The sister who dies after the fall is Gaelle, because you can see the blood in her left hand while holding her surviving sister's hand lying on the ground, after she killed the journalist. So the former nun, Sarah, lives on happily with Joachim, and they even have a child, shown in the final scene."
1,Buyers Beware of Adorama!,"I ordered these Sony mini-dv cassettes from Adorama and received a similar product, but not the one that was shown in the advertisement. What I received was a cheaper version. Although it was Sony, it is a product produced oversees in France and comes in yellow/orange packaging. These are not the Sony blue packaged cassettes that are made in the USA for camcorders using N. America region technology. There are plenty of warnings I came across regarding quality of the orange/yellow tapes. The model # is slightly diferent too. When I called Adorama to resolve the issue, the phone would just ring and ring forever. Finally, when someone does answer they are extemely rude, condescending, and transfer you to another dept. that never answers the phone. Unfortunately, I am stuck w/ the tapes as I do not wish to pay additional shipping. However, I will never order again from Adorama and I hope that you are fortunate to avoid any transactions with them."
1,False Advertising,"NOTE: These are not the blue cassettes pictured! They sent similar tapes in orange packaging. They say Sony on the package, but I called Sony and they didn't have the model # on record. After researching, I found them 2 be grey market tapes. I didn't want to damage my $600 camcorder.They did give me a refund. However, I paid for shipping both ways. My total was $23.33. I was only refunded $15.36."
3,Sony medium quality,"Enougth for many Mini-DV Camecorder, but not for good quality 3Mpixel camecorders"
4,Excellent Choice for the SONY Mini DV,"Loads great, Records silently, Replays like a champ. Tried on SONY and seems like it is the best thing I did"
1,Dissapointed Fan!,"After reading other great reviews on this disc, I ordered it and waited anxiously to to receive it. Much to my chagrin, it was scratched throughout the beginning of it. I sat there with the remote in my hands trying to forward the disc to a unscratched section. No dice. What a BUMMER!"
3,Solid Collection,Great collection of up to date journal articles dealing with cutting edge issues of what virtual teams are as well as pedagogical implications for how to begin to set up best practices for teaching and learning.
5,Solid book on Photo filter effects,"Not only does this explain filters for camera use but also it walks you through many of the Photoshop filters and plug ins. If you are a serious digital photographer, this book is an excellent reference."
5,Great Filter Book,This is a very comprehensive book on the use of filters in photography. The author touches on all of the popular filters and explains their purpose and efffects. The book is illustrated very well and the pictures explain his points clearly. I would recommend this book.
3,You get what you pay for,This wet saw blade is OK if you have only a few cuts to make. It takes patience to use this as it does not cut very fast. If you have a lot of cutting to do (30 to 40) then spend a little more money and buy a better blade. Your work will be done faster and the cuts will be smoother.
4,A Good Read!,"If you're an exec whose position requires any writing at all, it might occur to you that before you write an article or a speech you should jump on the Internet and do a thorough topic search - an original suggestion from author Stephen Spignesi. Thanks. You might even already know that you have to check reference materials at the library - another handy nugget of advice. But if your background is in technical expertise, not in word crafting, and you find yourself responsible for actually writing things - a prospect as enticing to you as root canal - then this book is for you. It organizes ideas concisely and simply (Almost too simply: Any sixth grader could use it). While some content appeals only to freelancers (Like a talk with a publishing house acquisitions editor), we [...] recommend the guidance and direction this book gives to would-be or must-be writers who are uncomfortable with writing. You know who you are."
1,One Terrible Movie--Don't bother!!!,This is a very bad movie--D movie--the acting is terrible--plot is poor--what is Richard Widmark doing in a movie this bad at the end of his career? I guess he needed the money. Willie Nelson was pretty bad-he should stick to his singing. This movie is so mickey mouse I barely sat thru it and I traded it in soon after I bought it. Avoid this one at all costs.!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Godd for Comedy Bad for a Western,I had expected more out of this movie than comedy. I was expecting a real western drama not a comical one like Blazing Saddles.
1,Zero star. It does not know what kind of movie it wants to be.,"This movie is not an western action. There only 2 shooting scenes in the whole movie. They looked childish. It's not a western comedy either. There are only a couple of funny scenes. Neither it's a drama. It briefly depicted the triangle love among Willie, the Texas Ranger who chased him, and a lady. The portray was too short to make this film a love story.The acting is bad too. It's not worth the money."
4,Excellent entry-level camera,"I've owned the Olympus D-390 for a good three years now. The lens has stayed in perfect shape for that time. The quality, even when zoomed close in, is exceptionally good. Included is a piece of software with a user-friendly interface for moving pictures from camera to hard disk.For anybody starting out with digital photography, this is an excellent camera."
3,Cheap but sexy,Straps are so very very cheap they are twisty and kinky. Panties are solid cheap elastic that rolls up the first time you take them off (no matter how carefully) and you will NOT be able to unroll them. The dress is sexy only because covering the naked body in fish net is sexy. Good for the price I guess.
4,adorable!,"This ""mini dress"" is very very mini, but is really cute! It comes with a matching G-string, so it really is a cute little playtime outfit. It's see-through enough to see tattoos through it, but good for hiding some small imperfections.Definite keeper!"
4,lingerie,"A little to thin, but good for price and you can't go wrong with fishnet. Red thongs set off outfit perfect."
2,"Seductive, but not quite what I was hoping for","I thought this piece would add something extra to my marriage and while it doesn't detract, it's not the sort of material or look that my husband is especially responsive to."
1,Misrepresentation!,"Item was not as pictured or described. It came with the cheap flat key and after twice ordering a return, I give up as they send the same lock. Complete waste of time. It does no good to contact Amazon customer service as they don't read the problem, they just issue a return authorization, and you get the same item...If you want the lock with the cheap flat key, you can get it cheaper here http://www.amazon.com/Trimax-TMC10-Deluxe-Coupler-Lock/dp/B000W0KUOO/ref=pd_sbs_auto_2As this is the actual lock that you will receive. They have since changed the picture for this item so you can't tell which type of key it uses, which is no good for the people like me that bought a misrepresented item.Buyer beware as they have set up another page to get more suckers to fall for misrepresentation. http://www.amazon.com/Trimax-Coupler-Latch-Lock/dp/B003NTJYW0/ref=pd_sbs_auto_27This company goes on the Do Not Trust list."
1,Misrepresented Item!,"While the lock seems ok, it is not what was pictured or what was written in the description. It has a regular key lock not the Type A key which is a spring loaded, 7 pin, high security key,(round key) as pictured or described in the write up. Disappointed with Amazon on this one. Never had any issues with anything ordered on Amazon til now. I specifically wanted the type of secure key pictured and thats why I chose this particular lock over some others I saw. Probably be returning just on principle."
1,Lock is OK; keys are a problem,"The TMC10, the lock by itself, is fine. But the keys are completely substandard. Unlike what is shown in the online product information, the keys are just standard keys rather than the round style (whatever that is called). The problem is that the keys are imbedded in really brittle plastic head. The plastic heads on both of the keys that came with our TMC10 have cracked and broken off. The ""blade"" of the key has no hole for placement on a key ring; just the head does. The result is that keeping up with the keys will become a real issue. And, no, there isn't sufficient metal at the top of the metal key to drill a hole in it; besides, why should I have to? I am replacing this thing before I lose the keys and can't remove the lock easily."
2,Not Worth It,"OK, so it's new and the first batch was a failure. I expected that. But be careful, the 1 cup of batter is too much; the 5 minute time on medium is too short; the outside of the waffles were well done while the inside was still moist (torn waffle);even pre-treated the waffles stick; finally, it's a terror to clean."
1,too dry,Have had this waffle maker for nearly a year and no matter what recipe or setting I use the waffles always come out dry and tasteless!
1,Get something else!!!,I got this waffle maker as a gift so I can't say it's not worth the money. I am extremely disappointed that the handle broke on the second use and the waffles do not cook evenly. It's drips all around although the clean-up of the actual waffle maker is pretty easy. I say spend your money on something else!
5,"Beautiful, fun and engaging","This year's Sega Sports football game is a blast. Superb graphics, excellent gameplay and phenomenal in-game highlights are icing on the cake. Chris Bergman's ESPN weekly highlights are AWESOME, and the overal feel and energy to the game is great.the game allows for full customization through sliders, so you can determine what kind of game this will be (run or pass? Offensive or defensive).Without a doubt the best football game on the market today."
5,Best of the bunch,"This is the single best pick for X-Box for a few simple reasons. #1, On-line play. Madden does not have it. No on-line play also means no roster updates. Does the Madden roster accuratly reflect the roster of the teams on Week 1 of the NFL season? Also, while you can have your buds over for some games, sometimes it nice to play at 3 AM with a real person. #2, The game-play flows very smoothly. NFL Fever is slow at best. #3, The graphics are outstanding, the sound is good, and the game presentation on screen is great. Replays are given decent commentary, and the camera angles for them are outstanding. #4 ESPN name brings with it NFL Primetime, a recap of the weeks games in a season mode. This includes highlights from computer-simulated games. Stats for each game are presented with Berman's commentary of the game. Great touch. #5, The Crib. It seems silly, but it is nice to unlock different things and set them up in your basement ""Crib"". Not essential, but a very nice feature."
4,MAD GAMER,"I'VE PLAYED THE DEMO AND FROM WHAT I'VE PLAYED IT'S THE BEST FOOTBALL GAME OUT THERE AS OF YET.I DON'T KWOW WHAT THAT OTHER GUY WAS BETA TESTING,MAYBE HE BETA TEST MY NUTS IN HIS MOUTH BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW DIDDLY ABOUT FOOTBALL GAMES."
4,THEY WENT ALL THE WAY!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS WAY BETTER THAN NFL FEVER , AND MADDEN. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD FOOTBALL ACTION. DROP FIFTY BONES FOR THIS PIECE. IT'S WAY WORTH IT."
1,Judged a Book by it's Cover,"I purchased this book because of the snappy title and the hope that it would be an entertaining read. However, halfway through the first chapter I grew bored from the exhausting use of sci-fi imagery and tedious storyline. This is not a book for Cubs fans. It is a childish plot and has little or nothing to offer in the realm of enjoyment. I have to wonder, with all the possible stories that could have been told about this hopeful event, why was this one so lame? As an avid Cubs fan, I truly hope it happens in my lifetime and I certainly hope that, when it does, it won't put me to sleep like Harper Scott's version did!"
4,Loved it,"Wonderfully funny. I bought it for my son to read. I had already read it a few years ago and will read it again in the off season.I would recommend it to all baseball fans, especially Cubs fans."
4,Rare talent,"I saw this man open up for Daniel Lanois in San Juan Capistrano and was blown away. This album has some songs (including the opening track) that are just plain beautiful. He is unique, and perhaps the closest comparison I can make is to Patty Griffin. His voice is that good, although more frail."
1,absolute garbage!,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire 40 years of life. The acting (if you call it that) is low rent, the entire filming is a giant charade. The guy playing Manson is pathetic and doesn't even resemble him. Some of the actors playing female family members are actually men wearing wigs.This is so bad I can't even put it in words. If you are a Manson buff, look elsewhere, nothing could be worse.....PERIOD!"
1,"Had potential, but failed badly.","I liked the basic premise the film was based on, the amateurish home movie rumor of the Manson family. I didn't even mind the fact that it is silent. The movie is awful because like other reviewers below said, the guy in this movie doesn't even resemble Manson, except he's got a beard. There is no acting, or even attempt at acting. When several of the characters that are supposed to be women are actually men in obvious drag, and they act ridiculous, the movie lost all hope for me. It fails in every category. Tongue in cheek or not. This movie is wasted money. It's sad when the best part of a DVD are the extras, and indeed with Manson Family Movies, you should skip watching the movie and go directly to the extras. Avoid wasting precious 88 minutes of your life."
5,"""The Breast Fairy Came to Minnesota""","What a great tool that I will be able to use over and over. Anyone who is raising or involved in raising a girl will benefit from reading this book. I am a mom who is ""IN IT"" right now. It felt so good to read and see the things I am going through, are the same events others have experienced with their daughters. It happened so fast, and the changes occur so fast, that you feel you have lost that little girl that was just there. The inseparable connection to the telephone; the privacy issues; not talking to mom; boys; MOOD SWINGS! Ms. Roberts book helped me to better understand the changes and gave me ideas on how to maintain and even strengthen my relationship with my daughter. I am encouraged and dedicated by this book. Thank You"
3,"very bland narration,,,,but still has much footage & information (at least worth $7.00)",this is not a bad documentary...it is 12 hours long...and well worth $7.00. The narration and way it is all put together is very bland..but if interested in seeing footage and hearing information..you will get it in this documentary. It is something you would expect to see other people sleeping with their heads down on their desks in history class...but for interested students..it is still informative and interesting.
5,Very pleased!,This book is a wonderful translation on the writings of St. Teresa of Avila. Each page lifts my mind and inspires my soul with increased fervor and sincerity to serve the Lord Our God. I am very glad I purchased this book on her life.
5,Required Reading,"""This well-written work, containing a wealth of information, should be required reading for all who want to understand the historic transformation of the G7/G8."
5,Legend...............,"You all know the deal. It's the legend, a Bob Marley classic. If you don't own this album, I really don't know what to say, other than it's a must own and should be in your collection. All of Bob Marleys albums are worth owning, but if your new to Bob, then this cd will help you get into his music, as Legend is a great starting point. Peep the songs ""Is This Love"", ""No Woman No Cry"", ""I Shot The Sheriff"", and "" Jamming"". These are all great songs, and they showcase Bob Marleys many creative sides. Purchase, and enjoy the Legend of Bob Marley."
1,Why I'm giving Bob one Star?,"Imagine a Beatles compilation that only includes songs like: Lady Madonna, hello good bye, Yesterday, obladi oblada, yellow submarine,octopus garden and let it be.That what's Legend is for Bob MarleyHe was dead when Legend came out and he would have hated it to.The songs are just a bunch of his most pop and Radio friendly stuff, songs like 3 little birds, Could you be loved or no woman no cry means nothing for the real fun.In Lengend Marley is pictured as a pop artist, who sings mostly love songs, while in reality he had a strong politic and social ideology wich whoever produced this compilation make sure to buried it with songs like 3 little birds or could you be loved.True Marley is on soul rebel, Rastman Vibartions, Catch a fire.on songs like ambush in the night, running away or sun is shinning.Don't bother with this album."
3,CD - Disappointment,"Legend - The Best Of Bob Marley And The Wailers (New Packaging)I was very disappointed in the condition of the plastic folder (cracked) and the CD was scratched in 3 places,,also had a small smear of some kind on the music side which I was able to get off. It took about 8 weeks to receive. Will never order again from this vender. Not exactly sure where it came from but had foreign writting on the mailer."
4,LEGEND,"This cd are great, all classics songs, the best of king of reggae. My favorites songs:jamming,bufalo soldier and could you be loved. ONE LOVE!"
2,STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL RELEASE!!!,"Unfortunately, this newly remastered version substitutes the original single versions of ""One Love"","" ""Buffalo Soldier"", and ""Could You Be Loved"" for the album versions. While they are still great, why change the versions for the remastered release? Although the sound quality of the original is not as good as the remastered version, I suggest hanging on to it for these reasons."
5,Awesome CD,This is the best cd! If you're into reggae I really recommend buying this one. Almost EVERY song is great!!!
5,It is Marley,How can you not love it? How can you not love it? How can you not love it? How can you not love it? Perfect.
5,Classic,"If you're browsing this item, chances are you're already familiar with this music. It is just what one would expect - the famous Bob Marley songs. A piece of history."
5,Simply Wonderful!,"If you haven't listened to much reggae or haven't bought a reggae cd, start with this one. I can honestly say, there is not a bad song on this album. Some are better, but all are good. My personal favorite is No Woman, No Cry which was recorded live at the Lyceum in London. Besides being a great song, the crowd is singing along which shows you how much brotherhood there is to be found in reggae. Everyone's your brother or sister. Of course, there's the hit I Shot The Sheriff. And the goodwill song of One Love. Buffalo Soldier is a great look into what African Americans came to during the days of slavery and how they felt (and possibly do feel even now). But really, you will not be sorry for buying this album. It gives great insight into the beliefs of the Rastafari and Bob himself. You'll either dance, sing along, cry, or think. No wonder Bob was the First Third World Superstar!"
3,where's the real legend,"I'am looking for the Real legend CD with all the studio cut's not the bogus version put out by dumb gong records. This version is like taking a shower without soap, it just dosn't come clean."
2,It's a CD.,I love Bob Marley. LOVE.Unfortunately I thought this was on vinyl. It's an audio CD. I almost cried when it was delivered to my home. I was really expecting a Marley record. That's what I typed into the search bar. I wasn't looking for CD's.
5,listen,"This man is a legend for a reason, listen to his words and you will understand why. His message from his songs was always positive and it will live on forever."
2,Only disc 1????,"When I bought this it said it included both discs, but only downloaded one. When I checked the cloud, it said I only purchased one disc????"
3,Just ok,"I have always wanted a Bob Marley CD & this was my first one. It isn't as good as I thought it was going to be :-( The song ""I Shot the Sheriff"" is a very strange verison & sounds nothing like it usually does. I wouldn't have bought the cd if I knew that song wasn't the orginal version."
2,too cleaned up for the purist,"have a couple cassette tapes of cheap studio time-love the earthiness of his sound. you can hear the steel drums and the rushing of the dunns river falls in his music. this cd is too cleaned up. no rasta here, mon. guess i need to find his older stuff for the sound i crave."
4,Great CD,"If you like Bob Marley, this CD is a good collection of some of his best songs. There are a few key songs not on the album, but overall what is there is good, and the recording quality is good."
5,Must have for any true fan,"Anyone with taste is going to love this album. Has classic Marley tunes that even the most cursery reggae fan will know. While I don't consider myself by any stretch a true reggae afficinado, this is the one album I own on vinyl, tape and now CD. One Love, which frankly I skip over becuase all I can think of are the commercials now when I hear it, is still a great didity. For Eric Clapton fans, here the orginal version of I Shot the Sheriff. Buffalo Soldier and others are just truly classic songs. From begining to end this CD is wonderful. The two bonus tracks are OK and don't take anything away, but also don't add much to this wonderful collection. VH1, for those who care, has this listed as one of the Ultimate Albums. If you've never listened to reggae before, there is no better place to start than with this artist and this album."
3,Can't see what all the fuss is about,Most of the songs here are pleasant enough but Mr Marley is no Chaka Demus and Pliers. It is also disappointing to note that Mr Marley reportedly took drugs during his lifetime.
1,"I'll be jamming with out the Marley, thank you.","First off, I'm not a reggae guy. I think the music is really phony and it doesn't say anything. Supposedly it's angry music but to me it is a really superficial sound. Second, I think the music is about the most unnerving and grating music ever performed by human musicians. Also, I don't get the 'We Be Jamming' thing. I know it's only a 5 minute song but to me it feels like it just goes on and on. I'd say if you're a conformist, and person that doesn't enjoy standing out of the crowd then buy this album. However, if you cherish individuality and evolution in art then you won't need any of this crap."
1,I dont like him,I dont see anything in this guy. I mean his accent is really annoying and you can't even dance to this music.
5,A MASTERPIECE,"This is one of my all time fave albums, love nearly every song on it. Good to blair when you're driving in traffic."
5,I wanna love you - and treat you right,"I love Bob Marley's music and by all accounts he was an outstanding musician and a good man. I bought this CD after watching Kevin Macdonald's Biopic and continue to enjoy the lyrics, reggae rhythms, authentic Jamaican twang - and pervasive sense of hope and redemption."
5,Fantastic,I bought this for my son. This is such a great record. Nothing like listening to a vinyl record. Great sound and great music.
5,Jah Mon!,Great jams from a true legend. The title of album says it all. All songs are good quality and well worth it.
4,A Reggae Essential,"Bob Marley is truly a Legend. In my mind, it's a shame he died so young. I bet he'd still be making genius music if he were still alive.But at least we have Legend, an awesome album with some truly awesome songs. For example, ""Is this Love"" is one of my favorites, as is ""No Woman, No Cry"" (the live version) and ""Jamming."" Although most of the songs on this album are excellent, there are a handful of weak tracks, such as ""Stir it Up"", ""Easy Skanking"", ""Could You Be Loved"", and ""Exodus"".But, as I said, most of this is good. Just a couple other minor complaints. For one, where are ""Trenchtown Rock"", ""Lively Up Yourself"", and ""Roots, Rock, Reggae""? Also, the live versions of ""Get Up, Stand Up"" and ""I Shot the Sheriff"" are the definitive versions.If you like Bob Marley, Reggae, or 70's music in general, Legend is a must-buy. However, don't get it without ""Live!"" also by Bob Marley."
3,music: great. hearing it: even better.,"The cd is great--Bob Marley's music is great. But the people who sold it to me didn't mention that the cd won't play past a certain song. It won't play at all on my upright cd player, but on a standard one it will play fine until Buffalo Soldier which is where it begins to skip endlessly. I still love Amazon, I'd just be cautious about that seller."
2,defective track 7,great cd if all the tracks worked. I returned the first to amazon because track 7 just stops and won't play. I recieved a replacement and track 7 just stops and won't play. I have to forward it to track 8 to finish listening. My player plays all my other 80 plus cds fine. So the problem is in this cd.
5,could not ask for better service,i got the cd way before they said i would ....that was nice ....and in the good shape they said it would be. i was very pleased with the service
2,"Great tunes, terrible mastering","I bought this CD based on all the great reviews here on Amazon, and of course because I recognize many of the songs from years of radio listening. Having now listened to this disc a couple of times, I must say I find it tiresome. The mastering sounds compressed and cold, and on some tracks the drums/bass are loud enough to be louder than the vocals. It's like it was mastered for the club/hip-hop crowd. Do yourself and favor and try to find an earlier version, not this remastered one."
5,Bob Marley Legend,"Excellent listen! Bob Marley at his best. Redemption Song speaks to the heart of the listener. The build up to No Woman, No Cry excites the listener, from the roar of the crowd in the background to his perfectly excuted vocals."
2,This is a CARELESS dealer,"I received my Bob Marley CD in the mail yesterday. When I opened the perfectly intact box to remove the CD I was very shocked to find that the CD case was completely broken in half! I was expecting to find the CD broken as well, although it wasn't. Being that the box was in perfect condition, the damage to the CD case had to have been caused before it was shipped. I am a huge collector of music & keep all my CD's in there original cases so I am very dissapointed that this CD arrived with the plastic case in pieces!"
5,"A blend of Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin","Shaka Buku is the future of Reggae. You have to check this out. Its a blend of Bob Marley, Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin. No average songs, its wall to wall jams that hit you in the gut and move you at the core of your life. I can't stop listening to it. Check it out at http://www.shakabuku.com and hear for yourself."
2,Absorbing primitivism -- and silly words,"Some of Bob Marley's tunes are all right, but too many of his lyrics are preachy and -- let's face it -- downright absurd. Do YOU think the West is Babylon or that Ethiopia's Halle Selassie (!) is God? All in all, Jamaica's best musician remains Noel Coward, even if he didn't start there."
5,Worth so many more than 5 stars....,"Unbeliveably good album. One of my personal top 10 favorites, period. If you want to hear some real music, if you want to party, if you want to mellow out, buy this album (don't borrow it, you won't want to give it back)."
5,Great,"Well, i would have to say im not the biggest of Bob Marley fans. But i heard his songs before, and i knew a little about him... my uncle has this cd, so i wanted to get it. I have to say i fell in love with it. Bob marley is a great person, and his songs are so relaxing, He was a good musician. I just only knew 2 songs before i got this cd Stir it up, jammin. I grown to love every song on here..Go buy this.."
3,LOVE THE MUSIC,"i have always loved Bob Marley and am embarrassed to admit i had to update from a cassette to a CD just recently; not because i am that out of touch, but i couldn't find ""Legend: Best of"" that i had been trying to find forever.the music is the same that i've listened to thousands of times, but i have to admit that the quality isn't what i was expecting. in the middle of ""No Woman, No Cry"" there is this god awful high-pitched sound; it's not a screech, it's more of a tone that lasts just long enough to hurt a little bit. once you get past that, it's all good. i haven't noticed this on any other song.not sure if i would recommend; ""No Woman, No Cry"" is my favorite song but i don't play it as often as i would like; the tone actually makes you cringe a bit."
5,Very Pleased,"I ordered the CD shortly before Christmas, not expecting to get it before Christmas and I did. I was very happy because my husband wanted that for Christmas and he loves it."
3,"An o.k. disk but definetly not a ""greatest hits"" album.","Is this the thanks Bob Marley should get for pouring his heart and soul into his music? I think not. If you are looking for a greatest hits album, check out his live concert in Chicago 1975. Now there's a C.D. that captivates his message, beautifully. This C.D. just has way too many mediocre or played- out songs."
5,bob is god,"This album is a collection of all of Bob's best songs. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest albums ever. Some of the songs have almost become a lifestyle. There is loads of variation and each song is absolutely unique and special. I love the mellowness and flow of the songs. The greatest thing about this album is that it was released soon after Bob's tragic death and, since it is by far his best and most famous album, it caused him to be unforgotten and always be remembered as one of the greatest musicians of all times. This album reflects that to the fullest extent and that deserves five stars."
5,Absolutely IRIE !!!!,"Even though Bob has been gone for some time now, his music still inspires and stirs the soul. This compilation CD is one the best all-time greatest collection of music. Period. It covers joy, love, depression, and inspiration. I would recommend CD to EVERYBODY !!! It's worth it ...."
5,Excellant,This collection of songs by Bob Marley and the Wailers is a great summary of Marley's Music all around. What I mean is that it contains some of his early works and some of his later works. This combination shows the evolution of Marley's music throughout his time as the number one reggae musician in Jamaica and around the world. Nothing can match this CD.
5,Bob is great,The product arrived on time. The packaging was flawless. The vinyl was brand new. Happy with the product. I will definitely order more vinyls from amazon.com.
5,Excellent Book with Lots of Cajun Local Color,"My four-year-old daughter first got this book as a loan from the local library, and liked it so much that I bought her a copy to keep. Kids love Sue's free-spirit character and are fascinated by the alligators with whom Sue grows up and regards as her siblings. The book is broken up into three or four chapters, all colorfully illustrated. Because the book is a bit long for younger children, I find it best to read only one or two chapters at a time. Highly recommended."
5,"extremely helpful, especially if you're really down","I read it in one sitting, crying half the time, laughing the other half. It really made me think about life and death, and not trying suicide, as it would really be the wrong answer. If you're considering suicide, this book is a ""must read""!!"
5,Heavenly Answers to Earthly Questions,"This is the most important book I have ever read. I have read everything I could find on the topic of near-death experiences for the last 32 years. This topic of what happens on the other side of our existence, it very important, comforting, uplifting and interesting. It also gives one knowledge of what is ahead. This books has all the answers to all the questions anyone will ever ask about what happens when one passes over to the other side of existence. It is all here in one book. I truly wish I would have had this book thirty years ago. I am purchasing at this time copies for my husband and all my children. The information contained in this book really gives the answer to the reason we are alive and here in this place. It tells us what the consquences of our actions do, what we should be thinking about and how we should live our lives every day. I recommend that this be required reading for everyone!"
3,Spare Air 3000,Call me paranoid but these things seemed like a good idea. A self contained air supply good enough to get back to the surface. Everything arrived as described and on time. Quality appears high. I also purchased the optional screw in air gauge. It's not very convenient to mount on my BC jacket (actually it's a pain to mount it where its accessible and yet not in the way). It also loses air pressure over time so it has to be checked/refilled before every dive session (not every dive but I'd recommend checking it if you haven't for a couple of weeks). It's also been handy for a quick shallow dive to inspect underwater hull damage. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase.
2,Ok for a $1,This pointless tale of fiction poorly based in history reads quickly. It is mostly painless. As I got it in a Dollar Tree for a $1 it is ok toilet tank reading.If you would like it send postage.
1,Rock? For babies?,"I was shocked to discover that this CD included Spanish classics for children, set to repetitive, synthesized disco/rock music. Very unpleasant. If you want soothing or gentle renditions, this is not for you."
3,Too fast to be baby's first,"For this to be baby's first songs, they're sung too fast even for me to understand, and I'm a native speaker!"
5,Very Cute Kitty!,My daughter just turned 5 and she loves Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses and Twyla is an excellent addition to her collection. She is really soft and just adorable! Unfortunately Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princess toys can not be found in any of the retail stores so it was a nice find!
5,Great Video!,"I don't own this video, however, I rent it from the public library and my almost two year old loves it!! We rent it every other week because other parents love the video too. There are so many catchy and fun tunes. Like other viewers had said, my daughter gets excited and entranced by it too. My daughter refers to this video as ""Lowly."" I grew up on Richard Scarry books and my daughter will too, along with the fun videos. I highly recommend this video along with the Busiest People ever and the ABC one! We will be purchasing this real soon!"
5,Top-notch video for your little ones,"This is a WONDERFUL video, innocent, sweet and magical. The animation is delightful, in visually appealing colors that will remind you of your favorite Mother Goose Book. The characters are fun and imaginative, articulate and soothing. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the ""Merry Old King Cole"" segment. To top it all off, the singing is absolutely incredible, with no less than broadway-quality voices. You will even find yourself singing these songs. After watching this video several times, I had the song ""Little Boy Blue"" in my head. So one morning I started singing it as I was getting my daughter dressed...she stopped to listen and then clapped afterwards. This video is a must for your little one's collection, and is worthy of passing down from generation to generation."
1,"Horrible Movie, Bradley Stryker Get's The 1 Star","This movie was so dumb and slow. Very bad picture quality and it is also fullscreen. It also has a storyline that we all have seen a hundred times. I only gave it 1 star because I am a fan of Bradley Stryker, he is so hot. Look at his abs, muscles, and hot face. I tell my friends about him and they think that he is hot too. I am teen guy and I want to be like him. He should really consider some real movies instead of the B- movies for DeCoteau. You should see this movie just for the scenes with him. He is also in the first Brotherhood movie."
1,"Horrible Movie, Bradley Stryker Get's The 1 Star","This movie was so dumb and slow. Very bad picture quality and it is also fullscreen. It also has a storyline that we all have seen like a hundred times. I only gave it 1 star because I am a fan of Bradley Stryker. He should really consider some real movies instead of the B- movies for DeCoteau. You should see this movie just for the scenes with him. P.S. he is also in the first Brotherhood movie too, in case you didn't know."
1,A CARBON COPY OF I KNOW WHAT YOU DID...,"Boring and like most every other new horror movie. Lame mask,I think the awful movie Cut used this mask also,who cares I suppose. This goes with all the other pathetic new era horror movies(Scream,I Know What You Did,Valentine,Urban Legend,Cut etc..) so bottom line don't waste your time,stick with 80's Slashers."
4,Typical and Fun,"Final Stab is nothing new. Even on the back cover, it basically admits to being a [take off] of ""scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer"" but nonetheless, it is a lot of fun. Crazy Psycho killer...It's April Fools day! What could possibly happen? The Special effect are rather cheesy, and were undoubtedly purchased at Party City. (The ""FILMIX"" stuff that you glue to you body to make you look wounded, for halloween.) Anyway, there are several references to ""Halloween"" and other genre films, trying to mimic scream in the ""Knowing the rules to stay alive by watching horror movies."" It does have it's moments. The killer's mask is pretty sweet, the acting isn't terrible... it isn't bad at all.

2,Final Stab,"boring, sorry david, this is one of you worst (hardly any male flesh which is you trademark) at all. some nice guys in the movie."
3,A pretty good Anthology,"This is a series of short stories, from various authors (not Asimov)each having a werewolf theme. There's no point in me giving splot summaries for several short stories, but a couple of the stories are a real interesting read, in particular the very first story in the anthology is great by Gregg Keizer, it's about a Viking ship at sea which may or may not have a werewolf in its crew. It's a dark story, filled with lore, and drama. It's worth buying the book just for that."
1,Not what I was expecting,"First of all let me tell you that because of the title of this book I thought that most, or at least, some of the stories in it were written by Isaac Asimov himself, but thats not the case.This is just a compilation of some stories that have appeared in Asimov's magazine, not stories that were written by him.I accept that it may have been my fault for not noticing it at the timethat I bought the book, but anyway because of this I was so dissapointed with the book that I never really got into it.I have to admit some of the stories were good and I liked them, but some I didn't finish and others I didn't even start. Since I recently realized that I would never finsh this book I donated it to my local library.If you are an Asimov's magazine fan you will probably like this book, but if you want to read stories written by Asimov himself look elsewhere."
4,A Mixed Bag,"I am a huge werewolf fan, especially of lycanthropy as a metaphor of teenage female puberty/menstruation (Ginger Snaps, Annette Curtis Klause's Blood and Chocolate). Therefore, I greatly enjoyed the stories ""Boobs"" and ""An American Childhood"".""Madonna of the Wolves"" and ""What Seen But the Wolf"" were fascinating in their premises, but lagged at times. ""Red"" and ""Two Bad Dogs"" were my least favorite, they seemed out of place for some reason.It's a good compilation, and worth a look if you're a werewolf lover."
4,A good listen,I listened to this as a child back in the late 70's to very early 80's. I enjoyed it so much that I took to the internet to find it on CD and here it is! I particularily like the fact that it was recorded live so when they read a story their slight pauses and inaccuracies just add to the fun of it! I would sit and make up dance moves to the song Up on the Rooftop! I highly recommend this cd to parents who have children basically any age group....heck I'm 36 and I love it!
5,Love seeing a new western!,"I saw this movie at a screening in Los Angeles. The creator of this movie is a super talented young guy, Tanner Beard. I think he is like a young Texas Orson Welles as he wrote, starred, directed, edited and produced this movie. It is an ambitious undertaking and he did a great job. The visuals are pure Texas. The acting supports the storyline (which is ambitious) and I just enjoyed the end result so much. Henry Thomas is stunning in his role, looks the part and acts it. Glenn Morshower has a nice turn in this as does Lou Taylor Pucci. But for my money Kevin Alejandro is one of the high points of the film. he disappears into his role so much you don't even recognize him. Very fun movie!"
3,Legend of hells gate,The movie is ok my family knows the real story.What I was told when I was a child is diffrent. It is more around Possum Kingdom Lake.
2,Not that good,"No idea what was going on at the beginning with the Confederate soldiers. No idea why they wanted the saloon owner. Barely a walk on for Summer Glau, the real reason I wanted to see it. The acting was okay, sound & filmography was pretty good. Story line not so much so. An ending without an ending. Well worth, oh wait it wasn't $1.99, never mind."
1,Legend of hells gate,"Sorry to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Very confusing, dark, boring and bad storyline. Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes"
2,Hell's Gate - A lengendary flop,"Labeling this film as one of conspiracy and portrayal of real events is mere gimmickry. The writer's attempt to weave John Wilkes Booth as an escaped assassin is not only historically inaccurate but a failed attempt at making the story that is told more interesting. The last half of the film portrays only one of several legends associated with Hell's Gate when three thieves are caught and killed by Indians in the hills of Possum Kingdom Lake, Texas. While the acting is strong, the film is ruined by the disjointed and questionably relevant introductory sequences and failure to develop its stated theme. Artist expression or failed attempt at storytelling? You decide."
1,The Legend of Hell's Gate...,"Waste of time and money. As a fan of westerns, I wanted so much more but was left totally high and dry. TOTAL GARBAGE..."
1,"This is a Motorola V3 charger, and is labeled as such.","This is clearly labeled as a Motorola V3 charger, and so it gets a maximum of 500ma, which is not enough to power an AT&T 8525 during a call. I am extremely displeased that Eforcity would deliberately mislabel an item like this."
4,Charger,Unit charges cell phone quickly but gets very warm in the process. I will not leave this unattended for a long period of time while plugged into the wall socket.
2,Deflector Not Compatible with Murano,"This deflector, while well made, is not compatible with the 2nd generation Nissan Murano. The roof of the Murano is curved and there are seams on each side that prevent proper adhesion of the deflector to the roof. I installed following the directions to the letter and the deflector worked great the first day. The second day I noticed that the corners had already started to come unstuck (2-4 inches on each side). This clearly posed a safety hazard as it was only a matter of time before the deflector came off at high speed in the rain or snow. I unfortunately had to return because it would not work with my car's roof design.All in all this is probably not a bad product for cars with a flat, seamless roof."
3,Marginal,"This recording did not live up to my high expectations. I was particularly moved by a live performance of Faure's Masques et Bergamasques and was seeking a good recording. It seems this orchestra is lacking precision with entrances and attacks and I feel this Gavotte particularly benefits from a certain rigidity in tempo that is absent in this performance. In addition, I feel this recording of the Requiem is particularly poor because the fine vocalists seem to be fighting each other rather than working as a single instrument. All in all, a decent effort, but there are many other far superior recordings. For a fine recording of the Masques et Bergamasques, follow the link below.Faure: Pelleas et Melisande; Masques Et Bergamasques (Incidental Music)"
5,Must see Monster Movie!,This was awesome! The perfect film for you Halloween party! If you like the old King Kong and Godzillas you cannot miss out on Amphibious!
3,wrong title,"Just saw the trailer. I think the title is wrong. Creature looks to be a giant sea scorpion. This would be an arthropod or insectoid type of creature. It might be amphibious, but not an amphibian. 3 stars for the trailer."
3,Made for TV Movie,Not a cinematic masterpiece but it passed the time. Typical Sci Fi channel makeup and plotline but enjoyable. Thanks guys.
2,Okay,"good if you are bored but not good. its a creature feature in the strictest sense - the creature is the feature and pretty boring at that. i would give this one a pass unless you are realy, stoned, really bored, or trying to sleep. Totally, not worth the money, I would recommend you save it and buy a taco."
2,The plot needed some help,"Not a fan of the ""not sure who the star really is"" movies. The life on a fishing platform was well depicted and sad. The rest of the movie to include the monster lacked consistency."
2,The ending stinks,Even Michael Par'e couldn't make this a better horror movie. The ending could've been a whole lot better. definitively a low budget flick.
4,A must for anyone who wants to invest!,I have read many books on Buffett and this one definitely picks apart Warren's thinking and amazing ability to find a company with great potential. Timothy has revealed Buffett's ideas in such a way that I'm convinced everyone should be able to find financial security with a little patience.
3,Great introduction to Warren Buffett's investing style,"This book was actually the first book I've ever red on investing. I only knew the name Warren Buffett, and didn't have a clue what value investing ment. The author of this book gives a clear presentation on the way Warren Buffett picks his stocks. The literature may seem a bit simplistic at times, but in fact it's quite reasonable thinking.The only disadvantage was the author his language use and the grammatical mistakes in his book. This could have easily been avoided, but I don't have the impression the author did an effort on this."
2,Misleads readers into thinking Buffett uses the exact method,"I am an avid reader of Warren Buffett's writings, and I believe that Warren Buffett would disagree with many items in this book. For example, Warren Buffett previously described his method of discounting companies in other articles, and it does not match the author's description.I can see how this book would be highly rated to someone not familiar with the details of Buffett's own articles and letters. But in my opinion, the book appears to only about 80% in agreement Buffett's previous writings. This book can give the reader a good overview of Warren Buffett's methods if they do not pay strict attention to the author's details."
1,I dont like....,"I might have bought wrong book. However, I didnt like the term he said.that was something like ""profit made trading within a year should be apply 100% tax.""I think he said that because he started losing money in stock market as many online traders have gained thier edge.Thanks"
5,Important Lessons for Investors,"This is another great book for investors interested in learning value investing practiced by Warren Buffett. The chapter that I found the most helpful was Chapter 11: Understanding Return on Equity. The return on equity formula is very simple because it is net income divided by equity. Even though I have a degree in finance with concentration in accounting, I found this chapter very helpful because sometimes people have to be told certain things ten times before it finally clicks. This is how I felt about this chapter. It made me really understand the return on equity concept better. And in the end, it made me a better investor. I highly recommend this book to anybody, no matter what level.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
5,Buy this one!,"This Buster Keaton DVD is well put together, reasonably priced and showcases some rarely seen Columbia shorts. The prints are great quality and Keaton's work is timeless. My kids love him. Very pleased with this collection. It takes pride of place on my DVD shelf. Buy it!"
2,pas si mai mais il y a des bugs en ligne sur xbox live,"en general ce jeu est quand meme bien fait et parfois amusant mais il y a rien de bien neuf dans le monde du hockey , ce jeu ressemble a pas mal de jeu que j ai deja vu et n apporte pas grand chose de neuf. les graphiques pourraient etre mieux , j ai joue a nhl 2002 sur dreamcast et gamecube et je les prefere a cette version de xbox. l option xbox live semble bien mais le hic c est que les statistiques ne sont pas compilees correctement par xbox live , lorsque l on perd la connection a une partie , l on se vois parfois credite d une defaite... parfois l on perd la connection et ca peut se produire frequemment. cela m a extremenent decu. ce jeu comporte certaines erreurs de programmation pour ce que est du jeu en ligne. pour ceux qui ne jouent pas en ligne ca pourrais etre pas si mal mais a part ca non. j ai parfois eut aussi des problemes avec le jeu comme parfois il gele meme en mode 1 joueur. je ne le recommanderais pas."
2,Not so good audio level,This CDs has not a good audio level (low). I don't know if it depends on Style Council's muic or it it causes by a not so good digital remasterizing.
5,Excellent game,Loaded Questions Junior Edition is great for kids and adults. It is the most fun of any game our family has played in a long time.
5,Send Me,"All I can say is in these last days, what else would you rather be doing with your life? If you're 18 or 80, and you know that God is calling you to the ministry, be sure to listen to these messages and say, ""Here am I, send me!"""
2,not what I hoped for,Sometimes these kind of books can really be interesting. This was not one of those books. Overpriced.
2,Art?,"The art in question is... well... horrible. It looks like the ""artist"" took pictures of real life people, then used photo-manipulation techniques to turn them into fairies. They look creepy and ugly.The book, however, does have some good points, in that it lists quite a few good spreads. That's about the only thing I'd ever use it for."
3,"Not tarot cards, oracle cards","As much as I enjoyed the beautiful pictures & meanings of the cards, this was not the deck for me - brand-new to tarot. Things that detract on this deck:--no major & minor arcana--no listings of how the cards might equate to the major & minor arcana of a more ""standard"" deck--no one word listing on the face of the card stating the most general meaning.--these cards are not good for doing readings for others (my purpose), because you will spend more time explaining your deck and how it does/doesn't correspond to the standard deck than doing the reading!Things that are great in this deck:--beautiful pictures--interesting history of the fairy on the card--good ideas for self readings"
5,Fairy Friends,"I must admit that I was first drawn to this deck by the artwork, the fairy pictures are lovely. I didn't really think it would work very well, not being a traditional tarot pack. Then I started to read the book, and it is very deep indeed and Anna Franklin has obviously done a lot of research into fairies and the book made a lot of sense to me. When I started using the cards they just blew me away! The readings cut right to the chase. I love the whole thing.After this I bought their fairy encyclopedia to learn even more."
4,The Way Of Fairies,"This is a really neat Tarot Card set for readers. As a note though, I would not recommend it for people who are just learning how to read Tarot. Unlike most Tarot decks. Guide To The Fairy Ring only has 60 cards and is separated by seasons rather than the typical shields/swords/spears and etc. The reason why the cards are in seasons is because their are so many seasonal fairies out there and the deck all so includes the fairy festival cards.This is a a really good way to communicate and understand fairies. The book comes complete with fairy information/pictures of fairies, along with upright and revised meaning of the cards too.If you are new to the ways of fairies and reading tarot. I suggest Brian Froud's The Fairies Oracle. This set may be better suited for a beginner."
5,The Fairy Ring- a great card set,"The Fairy Ring is a wonderful set of tarot-like cards. They are beatifully illustrated and the book is written so it is easy to understand. It's really quite fun to do. I really enjoy this set and know that you will, too."
5,Easy to understand and work with,This is a good book for beginners. The cards are sectioned off by seasons and festivals. A person does not need to read the book from cover to cover. Cards with the layout spread are included and give instruction. The only reading nessecary is during the reading when interputting the cards. Once the person knows what each card means when it is right-side-up or reversed the book is not really necessary
5,What we are up against in 2008,"Massive irregularities in voting and in counting votes have been corrupting America's elections. Though mysteriously failing to make headlines, many of these problems have been well documented through books and film. A handful of outstanding documentaries have hit the screens, most of them focusing on Florida '00 and Ohio '04, but none gives so clear an overview, and none spells out so well what we are up against in 2008, as David Earnhardt's ""Uncounted."" If you only have time and energy for 80 minutes to understand the scope of the crisis, this is the one I recommend."
5,I becha think this song is about? Dont you?,"This is a must have, I mean if you have not heard this song and loved it their is something wrong with you! You just gotta listen to the album version! I love Janet's voice on this one, she just gots this, it's really hard to explain but she just gots like this really sexy manipulating voice... you have got to get this single it's one of Janet's best songs ever!!!!Go on girl:) ..."
5,great for the price!!!!!!!!!!,the gamecom is the best.. this item sits perfectly in your ear. the other headsets fall off your head and make your ear red. overall this is the one to get. i have too i use one and i have one for backup. trust me its really good.
3,Decent....,I recieved this headset after I got sick of buying regular xbox headsets since they snap so easily. This headset is sort of hard to keep on your head at times but it's pretty decent overall. For $20 I'd say buy it.
4,Nice set,This ear set works just fine. Volume control works well and in comming sounds are clear and loud.
1,I would give a 0 but i cant,"This product is not for the XBOX it is for the 360... and if you get this you will have to find a communicator module, but guess what nobody sells them by themselves."
4,OK...,"I liked this book. It was overall a pretty good read, if a little stereotypical. It wasn't as stereotypical as I thought it would be though. It would have been nice if Raven, the main character, hadn't been a standard black-haired Goth but you can't have everything. Raven wasn't a particularly imaginative name...2 Goths actually featured named Primus and Poison!I found this book pretty enjoyable though. It seemed to have about 5 different stories, but as it was all well written and Raven was a likeable (if sometimes quite soppy and girly) character, I didn't mind this. I was actually quite sad when it finished. I would recommend the book to somebody looking for a light read. I read it in about 3 days and yeah...it was good. The ending was quite disappointing though - hopefully this means there'll be a 3rd book..."
2,Preppy Goths,"I love reading vampire books, I'm in love with Anne Rice, but this book is completely different from what i thought it would be. Raven , such and obvious name for a goth chick and it's too preppy. She says she's an outcast but in reality she's just like everyone else. If you want a great vamp book go buy Twightlight, absolutely amazing series. But if u want fun preppy goth buy this one, you get to learn all about their clothes."
3,a good book,"16 year old Goth girl Raven has just received the shock of her life. Her boyfriend from Romania is a real live vampire. Now she is struggling with a big decision. Does she want to leave behind her normal life to become a cool ghoul? Spend her days in a coffin, and never be able to see her reflection? She hopes to be able to find Alexander at the coffin club. Instead she finds his nemesis! Now everything's gone completely insane. See what happens next in Kissing Coffins!It will get your interest very fast. It's so good you'll probably be upset when you have to stop reading it. I thought the book was great. It's very romantic. Most people would like it in my opinion; although not the most creative, it really makes up for itself in other ways such as the humor.Buy more than one of the books in this series at a time because they are rather small, though. If you have not read the first book here is a link:Vampire Kisses"
3,Felt like a young YA book,"I noticed somewhere on the inside flat (of at least that is where I think I saw it) that this book is intended for 12 and up. I read a lot of YA (and I'm not YA and haven't been for a while) and this is the first time I've finished a book and thought it was too young for me.The characters are just a little too flat. I find the kids at the high school more of an unintentional parody of High School rather than what it is really like. (Let alone Raven's parent's behaviour.)Anyway, I may keep reading this series as her writing style appeals to me and I even with the problems I like Raven's style."
4,Music?,"Kissing Coffins is a entertaining read and a real page turner. It takes you into your own underworld of goths and vampires. You begin to fall for memorable characters like Alexander. The imitation of brands like Hello Batty and Hot Gothics is quite funny. The only negative thing about this book is the name dropping of some bands. I understand that Evanescence can be seen as a goth band to the casual listener but Good Charlotte? Everyone knows they are a bunch of punk poser wannabes. A real goth woudn't be caught dead listening to them, no pun intended. Anyway, it is a good read for any fan of young adult vampire novels if you don't mind vampire stereotyping..."
1,not originals,There are only 12 songs on this cd: 1) Jam Up and Jelly Tight 2) Sheila 3) Dizzy 4) Crimson and Clover 5) Sugar Sugar 6) Heather Honey 7) Sweet Pea 8) Everybody 9) Baby I Love You 10) Hooray For Hazel. Unfortunately these are re-rocordings of the original ABC records. The sound is better but the background is not a live band but rather appears to be a synthsizer. If you want the original recordings there are better selections available elsewhere. JB
2,HORRIBLE GRAPHICS,"When I got this game, I was real happy. I teared out the wrapping paper and started playing.What I found was highly dissappointing.The graphics are not good.I was really mad that I didn't get NBA Live 2004 instead, which is MUCH better (I played it at my friend's house)So I played it a few more times and decided it really was trash.Finally, I went ack to the store and asked if I could return the stupid game and the people let me. I got NBA Live 2004 instead, and I was so much happier. A lot better of a game with 90% better graphics and more NBA style and entertainment.Don't waste your money on some stupid game like this, go buy NBA Live 2004 or NBA Street vol. 2 (if u really want a basketball games.)or get Need for Speed Undergroud, which is my most valuable game...that really rox.PLEASE LISTEN TO ME...THIS GAME IS NO GOOD!!!"
1,Get NBA Live 2004!!,"ESPN basketball is one of the worst basketball games I ever played. Everyone thinks sega sports are a lot better but there not. The graphics are not that good and the gameplay isn't that good at all. The crowd looks very unreal and the camera angles in this game are terrible. I recommend getting NBA Live 2004, which is a lot better. If tou want a real basketball game buy NBA Live 2004!"
2,not what i expected,"I loved 2k3! The few things i didn't like about i figured they would fix by 2k4... wrong.. They improved the graphics and extras, but the gameplay is awful. You can barely see your players. No matter which few, you can hardly tell who's who..Remeber TECMO BOWL FOOTBALL?? almost the same..The players also shoot the same form of a shot. I looked forward to this game for a while.. Let down. I guess i will have to try my luck with LIVE!"
5,NBA live sux,If you buy NBA Live 2004 then you are a fool. Sega rocks hard wit this killer b ball game. NBA Live does not even have XBOX live. that is stupid. This does. But i would still buy this if it didnt have xbox live even thou i do love playing it online.
4,Game is great...but game dont really work very good,The game is so much fun and the best basketball game out rite now but the game does not work...i've tooken the game back once already and i have to take it back again because the 2nd one i got dont work either..i dunno if its the game or what because my friend has the same game and it works but it takes a while to work or it will bring up that dirty disk thing for a second..the game is great but doesn't seem to work for me..anyone else have the same problem?
2,the camera angles suck,"Lets just start by saying that i've been an avid fan of the NBA2K series since day one and never really rated the NBA live series, but i have to be honest and say that NBA live 2004 really made drastic improvements this time and ESPN NBA2K4 isn't really better than NBA2K3. First of all the commentary sucks and the camera angles are dreadful, its no good improving the graphics if you set the camera so far away you can't see the improvements made. it's always nice to be able to adjust the camera, i dont know why they took this option out."
3,good product,"Seventh Generation Brown Recycled Paper Towels -120 Sheet Count, 2-ply 10"" x 8"" sheets - 8 RollsThis product is good for utility uses. Somewhat thin but good that is is recycled paper."
5,Great paper towels!,"I have been using these for several years, and find them to be stronger and more absorbant than many of the cheaper paper towels offered in the stores....worth the extra trouble to order and the extra cost. And the color goes better with my decor than white!"
1,Bland Photography,"Gerry Spence is a man of many talents, photography, however, may not be his strongest. The photographs are much better than your average snapshot, but not quite as impressive as they should be to have been published. All in all, the images are a bit of a dissapointment if one wants to appreciate fine art photography."
2,Product description is not detailed enough.,"I bought this along with the Hepa filter thinking this was the little sponge filter at the top of the Hepa filter. This is a replacement for the Hepa filter instead. If you are looking for a very cheap replacement, then this is what you want. I'd rather just have the Hepa filter. I didn't send it back, because it was so cheap, it wasn't worth the effort."
2,Poor quality,"Let me start by saying that I have purchased very inexpensive replacement ink cartridges in the past with wonderful results. When I print with these cartridges, the colors come out green & yellow. They look absolutely horrible and I will not purchase these particular cartridges again! I tried cleaning the print heads to no avail."
1,Nothing in my Canon Pixma 4000. No ink output whatsoever.,"Yeah, great, snapped into the printer just as the OEM's do. But when it's time to print, no ink is fed through my Canon Pixma 4000.I went to the store and purchased genuine Canon cartridges and voila! Prints fine. At least they didn't wreck the printer while delivering ZERO value.So for owners of the Pixma 4000 I can say with some reasonable confidence that your joy at having received four cartridges for the price of one will last until you try to print something.Then you can go to the store and buy the real ones. Total cost will be 125% of retail in the long run.These might work in another printer, but they sure don't work in mine- and I tried all manner of nozzle checks and cleaning and any other maintenance procedures I could run with the Canon software."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER MADE AND ALWAYS THE BEST FOR ME,"this is the best game . i love it i also love the movies 1 & 2 .THE LITTLE MERMAID IS THE BEST! it is very good and the graphics are cool! i like everything about it the other people thet dont like it are ............... sorry, but it is the best game i could nt find it and now i play it it is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very a thousand pr more times is the best game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
2,Worst graphics ever!,The clips from the movie are terrible quality. The graphics are even worse. They look like pictures drawn on construction paper by an 8 year old. The storyline is not in order of how the movie actually happened. I am finding that Disney does not put the quality from their movies into their games.
5,ONE OF THE COOLEST GAMES!!!!!,"This game was rather cooler than I expected. Rescuing PriceEric is not as easy as it seems, battling Ursula is really hard, finding the magic locket is fun, conducting Sebastion's orchestra is pretty neat, and battling Morgana is the best, most action packed game of all! This game really sticks true to the movie, and even my 12 year-old son likes it! If you liked the movie, you'll like this game!"
