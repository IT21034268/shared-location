2,Not for women who want to be challenged,"I watched this video knowing it wasn't going to be super challenging, but I was surprised at just how easy it was. I was looking for a yoga workout that would be invigorating and help sculpt my body, but this just felt like a whole lot of breathing. I didn't feel like my muscles were being toned at all."
4,Very relaxing!,I have actually been doing this workout on instant Netflix. I had limited yoga experience before getting pregnant and this DVD has been a great intro into yoga. Being my first pregnancy I didn't want to do anything too challenging and this video offers great modifications for those who need it. I've been doing it 1-2x/wk since I found out I was pregnant and I'm now at 17 weeks. I feel that it has really helped my lower back and hip areas in flexibility. The only down-side I've found is I wish they had another part of DVD with less instructions so I could get through the workout a little faster.
2,Not the best,"I bought this dvd along with 10 Minute Solutions: Prenatal Pilates. I really didn't like Yoga Mama very much. It moved really slow and was overall pretty boring in my opinion, and a little cheesy too. I also didn't really like that it's just one workout and that it's 40 minutes long. I recommend10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates- it's a way better workout, you can select one of five segments to do or combine them to make a longer workout, and I feel the instructor does a better job of explaining each exercise in a way that makes sense."
4,Relaxing pregnancy workout,"This DVD has been great for those days when you are too exhausted to do a ""real"" workout, but want to do something. It is not difficult, but feels good! The poses are very basic and all the moves are adapted for pregnant women. All the women in the video are in various stages of pregnancy and the directions are easy to follow. The DVD is not going to get your heart rate up, but it does help with easing aches and pains and increasing flexibility and balance."
1,For beginners only,"I tried this video thinking that it would be a good workout but it was not much of one at all. It went way too slow and did not cover a lot in 45 minutes. I did more in the ""Prenatal Yoga"" video in 15 minutes than I did in this entire video. I highly recommend that one because you can do it in 15 minute intervals or a total 45 minute workout."
2,Not challenging enough,"This video is too easy- I never felt I was exerting myself. I did some yoga before getting pregnant but was in no way an expert. If you want to be challenged at all I'd suggest Yoga Journal's Prenatal yoga, which I really like."
2,too slow,"This video has the right idea but goes way too slow. For some reason prenatal yoga videos I've watched, including this one, act like pregnant women can't workout at all. I at least want to break a sweat when I'm done. With this video it didn't happen. But I also was a runner before getting pregnant so maybe for others who haven't exercised they'd like it."
2,Not focused,"I bought this dvd because it's recommended by Fit Pregnancy Magazine. I was disappointed. Specifically,1. While there were women in all stages of pregnancy and she says you can ""modify as needed"", she doesn't tell you who you should watch for each trimester and only once gives a specific modification example.2. The flow of the exercises is uneven and doesn't flow the way a yoga class normally would.3. The music is clubby and not a good fit for yoga.4. Not great directions for poses.I think that Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea is muuucchhh better. She continually gives gentle guidance and suggestions for comfort, no matter your stage. It's challenging, but feels good after."
4,Best Prenatal Workout I have found so far,"I would say that most Prenatal Yoga DVD's are pretty lame. Upon saying that this one is the best I have found so far. It is quite easy but, of the many I have tried it is the most like an actual yoga class so you can modify and make it more challenging for yourself. It is a good length, I believe 40 minutes. I would recommend this DVD."
1,Not much of a workout at all,"The instructor talks A LOT throughout the entire video, overexplaining everything. There is a lot of stretching and downward-facing dog poses with your head constantly at your knees. I'm a beginner but even I found the pace of this DVD to be too slow."
2,Rushed!,"Anyone familiar with Yoga knows that one of the key principles is slow, abdominal breathing. This tape seems to totally ignore that principle. The exercises are so rushed that the instructor has to be PANTING, not taking slow, deep breaths.The tape does cover a wide range of stretches and poses. However, the veiwer would be better served if they'd reduced the variety and focused on doing fewer poses better."
4,Great for beginners!,I just did this workout for the first time and it was very relaxing. Since I am totally new to yoga this DVD was definitely my speed. If you've been doing yoga for awhile then this probably isn't the one for you...
4,Relieves Pressure...I love this CD,"I started using this CD when I was about 5 months pregnant. The weight of the baby was starting to put a lot of pressure on the lower half of my body. I noticed that when I was consistent with the yoga, my back hurt less and the pressure was eased on my bottom...it even relieved the hemorrhoids! When I wasn't consistent, the back problems and the rhoids returned.I will say this, when I first tried this video, I thought it was kind of lame and that the moves really didn't do much for me...I was SO wrong.Although I love the CD, I did not rate it with 5 stars because it is a little slow and there's too much hippy talk. But I totally recommend this CD."
2,not worth it,"I usually LOVE ""crunch"" videos, but this one was just to slow, I am pregnant not quadriplegic... they did downward dog WAY WAY to much, all the blood was rushing to my head and it was just way uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Thankful to de-stress,"I enjoy this video very much. I was not a workout ""freak"" before pregnancy, but I did exercise. I enjoy the stretching in this video, especially after a long day of teaching. I find that my back and legs hurt after work; this video helps me de-stress. I use this video about 4x a week, so yes, Sue does get ""corny,"" but who isn't corny after the 40th time you've viewed a video?"
1,Dont suggest this,This video was very slow to get going and I didn't feel I got a workout from it. Would recommend purchasing a different video
1,Waste of time,"This DVD is hopeless, and too easy even at 40 weeks. You dont even get a basic stretch out of it. The instructor is so fake, it drives you mad. Definitely try another DVD."
2,Too Easy!,"I purchased this video early in my pregnancy, and I was not very happy with the intensity level of the work-out. I am extremely active, and this video does not even make me feel as if I have used any energy at all. This video may be good for someone that is new to exercise, but for anyone that is expecting a challenging work-out, this will be too easy."
1,I hated this dvd,I was so looking forward to this dvd and now I feel like I wasted my money. I really dislike the instructor. She is like a flake. I can't stand her. The workout it self is boring as hell. I tried my best to warm up to it but that never working out at all. I had to buy another dvd because I just don't enjoy this DVD.
1,Do Not Bother,This video was a waste of my time and money. I found the voiceover annoying and the yoga sub-par.
4,Crunch Yoga,"This product is catered to pregnant woman and it reminds you to do it at your pace. I used it during my pregnancy and loved it. Just remember, everybody's condition is different, determine for yourself how you want to adapt to the instruction. Doing yoga during pregnancy is very good."
3,Partly functional,"I bought this footswitch for use with my Blues Junior III amp. The switch functions, but unfortunately, the LED doesn't work. That is, it doesn't light up when the switch is on. (At least, not with this amp...)"
5,Lovely performances,"We saw the show years ago and had bought a tape at that time. Over the years we really enjoyed listening to it. We eventually bought a CD, and recently bought another one for a family member who had visited Ireland and discovered and been charmed by Yeats' poetry while there. She reported she and her husband listen to it frequently in her car, and her grandchildren are now signing along with some of the songs when she has it playing. The whole family seems to enjoy it. It's a great way to hear Yeats."
4,Good helmet,Pro's: Light - won't put too much strain on young kids neck; very young child friendly design.Con's: Wish the padding was a bit more substantial. Padding is adhered w/ velcro which can come un-done.
5,Excellent helmet,"This is an excellent helmet. Our daughter is a very small 18 month old and it is nearly impossible to find a bike helmet for such a small head. This helmet is well made, very adjustable and very light. She is very picky about what she has on her head and this does not bother her at all. Very highly recommended."
4,Fits great,"We love it, and the fit is super for our 18 month old. Still a little big, but the pads that come with it make it snug."
5,Great Helmet,"The design and weight of the helmet is great. It seems to be true to size and fit well, plus there is cushioning inside to keep it from rubbing on your child's head. The only con is like any helmet, it would be nice to have more air flow to keep it cool. I definitely recommend."
4,Thumbs Up,"Our two year took to this immediatley, which from my perspective is half the battle. Hopefully we won't ever have to find out about the effectiveness of this product."
2,good as basic set only,"well,,,, it has all the episiods (sorry for bad spelling)but no extras and they are all wrapped in paper sleevesunlike most tv boxed setsbetter off getting the seasons seperatly"
5,The Greatest American Hero,DVD Set cam in perfect condition and is a great lost classic of the 1980's.
4,Uh... complete?,"I looked at the version of this with the cape and all that stuff, and it's 13 discs and like 2122 minutes. This is 600 minutes and 9 discs. Haven't bought it yet so I dunno, but it seems like something's misleading here.However, since it's cheap and it gives me a taste of the series, I'll probably get this one."
4,great DVD set of a great show at a great price,"I used to watch this show on TV and when I saw this DVD set I bought it on a whim. I figured I had fond memories of the show because of nostalgia and that I wouldn't enjoy watching it now. Was I ever wrong. This was a GREAT show - lots of fun. The special effects are a little cheesy and some of the plot lines are off but the actors and the dialog are the best. I think I actually like it more now than I did then.The DVD's are in a stack in the box - minimal packaging, which I actually prefer. No extras in this one. The picture quality is fine, it was a TV show - WAY before hi-def.All in all a great purchase which has provided me with hours of fun entertainment."
4,Still as good as ever,"Show is still as good as ever. Cheezy, good and fun, just like I remember. I am very happy and my family will love it!Packaging.... Everyone hates it. The paper is really cheap. At first I thought they were trying to imitate the box Ralph originally got his suit in, then.... I also bought the Dungeons and Dragons Animated series and it has the exact same kind of packaging.... So, I think I decided the execs are just being cheap. But, that's okay. Everything came across a lot better for $13 bucks than when I paid $60 or more for better packaging but got more damaged merchandise."
5,Single or Married?,Has anyone noticed that the episodes in season 2 and 3 are out of order? There are episodes in season 2 where Pam and Ralph are already married and also in season 3 before the episodes where they get engaged and then married. Were they originally aired that way or did the dvd manufacturers get them out of order? Are they possibly in production order rather than the order they were aired? Wondered if anyone else noticed or has an explanation.Debbie
5,A Great Bargain for a lot of Entertainment,"My husband loves this show and when I saw the price for this boxed set from Mill Creek Entertainment, I could hardly believe my eyes. I was concerned when I had read that a woman was having trouble with her DVD player when she played DVDs from that company, but we have had no trouble at all. The images are clear, full color, and the show is just as we remember. If you are thinking about buying this DVD set, I would say, don't hesitate. I don't know when you will get a better price.Nancy J. MaloneyHallsville, MO"
3,From a More Innocent Time,"This is a series from a more innocent time and a refreshing change from the complex plots based on perversion and corruption of today's TV series. It is really worth your while to travel back into a time when our TV heroes didn't rely so much on mobile phones and the internet and didn't take themselves so seriously. This was truly an enjoyable and very curious experience.However, the pack itself has some shortcomings. First, the box is just a housing for the individual DVD's, which are themselves accommodated in individual paper sleeves. Innovative, for sure, but not very posh at all. Secondly, the DVD's offer no language facilities or subtitles, which can be a problem for the impaired of hearing and for any foreign customers."
4,Where's Season 3 Episode 14?,"Packaging is on the cheap side as previously mentioned. Also, the final episode ""The Greatest American Heroine"" is NOT included. Otherwise, GREAT series."
3,Somewhat misleading main review,"I was clear that this was not the boxed set that included the cape and ""instruction manual"", but I did think that the ""Greatest American Heroine"" pilot was included which it is not. The only ""extra"" is an interview with Stephen J. Cannell, there aren't even subtitles available. Considering the price ($12.49 when I ordered, $11.99 as of 12/12/2010) and the fact that you get the series pilot and the forty-two regular series episodes on nine DVDs, I can't complain too much, but I really did want to see the ""Greatest American Heroine"" pilot, especially after reading about it as though it were included. The three star review reflects this disapointment, otherwise I would have gone with a four star review."
5,Greatest Ever,"I love Greatest American Hero. Reminds me of my childhood days. William Katt was the object of my affection and the show was funny. My husband and I love to watch it and wonder how it got to 3 seasons. It is so different how they filmed it compared to todays standards. I think I find it more funny today than back then, but for different reasons."
4,"Yeah, love it","Love it, got what I paid for. Packaging is typical Wall-mart bargain bin stuff, nothing to get excited about but if you are buying it for the content you can't go wrong."
3,Husband loved the show,"My husband loved this show growing up, so whenI saw it on Amazon, I knew I had to buy it for him. We watched and enjoyed Season 1 as a family. I love the theme song!!!"
3,A Blast from the Past,"I remember watching this series as a kid. I don't remember it being so cheezy. Compared to the high tech shows today, it lacks. But is still good, clean, family fun."
2,poor product,"this was a poor product because half the disks were missing. Whem I buy the whole series, I want the whole thing not just a few of the shows."
3,"Battery boo-boo, but great show",This is such a fun show and the packaging is very cute...but...beware of the batteries.Why the manufacturers thought it wise to install the batteries is a mystery. I had to return two purchases because the batteries in the notebook were so badly corroded that the entire box smelled awful. Your best bet? Order it used. Hopefully some previous owner will be smart enough to clean it up and remove the nasty batteries.
3,warning this not the deluxe ed. that comes with the cape ect,warning this not the deluxe edition of the set that not longer available it does not come with the cape deleted scenes extras lost pilot bloopers .the flashing lights instruction booklet or any thing extra this just a cheap version of the show with only 1 minor interview bonus ..buy the delux edition if you can still find it or buy the loose sets bye season instead..you wont get cape or decal or instruction booklet but get nearly every thing else at great price 5 stars for the show and nice plastic casing 1 star for cheap casings holding the dvds . and no bonuses avoid this set like the plague..im returning my set to amazon..only the second time in 15 years ive had to return anything to them
4,Classic 80s,"I wathed the series original run as a teen, and knew then it was cheesy back then. Of course it was in the era of A-Team... another show in which violence was often implied, but rarely seen. I now watch shows such as 24 in which are much more graphic.Re-watching Greatest American Hero as an adult, I realize my perception as a child was correct. It is CHEESY... but ya know, sometimes I just wish we could turn back the clock a little and have Maxwell Smart, Steve Austin and Ralph Hinkley over for borad games in the wood panel den."
2,Title claims to be complete series it is missing last episode,"While this is an enjoyable series, it isn't meant to be great epic it is meant to be fun and that is what it is. However the last episode of this MIllcreek production is missing, and like some of the Millcreek releases the picture quality isn't the best but it is fun and enjoyable and for those who are fans of many of the Stephen Cannell shows it is good to watch. Unlike Millcreek's release of Wiseguy which is missing several episodes in the middle of the series this is only missing the last episode. The one where the series showed the suit being switched over from Ralph to a new person."
4,Kinda cool,"this is good clean 80s fun. kinda chezzie sometimes. along the lines of ""the a team"" but not even that intresting, still nobody gets hurt exept the good guys and the bad guys always get what they deserve"
2,the greatest american hero music,over all the episodes are great but u done changed the music of a few episodes I dont like that It was better when it was leftnot touched it just needed to be brought into life on dvd with out the commercials Elton john was a classic in the piolet episodeand u changed it its were raplh and pam were headed out to nelson Corries mansion property and they were in the white Volkswagen please sell the piolet episode with the orgional music and also the eve of destruction was replaced Ill tell youwatching that show at first i loved it for its music and you almost ruied me wanting to return this dvd cause it made me feel like i got burned on this deal thank you yout intentions were good but I was unhappy with that one issue anyone else feel the same way please comment on my review
3,Great Price on a Full Series,"The price is right thankfully because this series does not hold up and is very hard to re-watch. Particularly with the removal of the popular music that was sprinkled throughout the pilot and each episode, this feels very formulaic and lackluster."
3,A silly show but I kind of liked it.,"The real saving grace of this show was Connie Sellecca, her being in it made it worth getting. The story lines are generally very silly and the Hero and his keeper both are border line idiots but at least some of the show are entertaining and anything I can see Connie Sellecca in is nice to have."
1,NOT THE SAME,if the product your buying doesn't come with a booklet and a cape then the reviews should be about the product that doesn't come with a booklet or a cape or so you would think. i got my set after ordering it based on the reviews but the review wasn't for what i ordered making the reviews i read pointless. so now what? don't make the same mistake
2,DVDs fine case was smashed,"Got the item, the case was smashed but the DVDs were fine. (so far)Contacted seller with no response."
2,"Interesting, but not something that would be useful for the next depression.","It was interesting, but I wasn't looking for a entertaining read, I was looking for something that had actual information as to what people did to survive, creative ideas that could be used today when times get tough."
5,Captivating,"A large format coffee table version, loaded with interesting and relevant pictures. Full of first hand account short stories. No regrets on this purchase. Couldn't put it down until I went through the whole book."
2,Bad buy,Postage was four times the cost of the product. The case has a mildew smell that won't go away. I have used Lysol wipes and Clorox wipes. The clip was broken. I didn't send it back because of the cost of postage. This was a rip off.
2,Waterman Rollerball Refill,"I received a Waterman Carene and a refill as a gift. I know the pen was quite expensive, but I was fairly unimpressed with it. It skipped frequently, especially on Post-its, and was not smooth writing at all. The pen was comfortable, and nice looking, but once I used up the ink, I put the pen away because I wasn't going to spend the money for a refill that didn't perform as well, in my opinion, as a 2-dollar plastic pen. Then I read that the Pilot G2 refill would fit into the Waterman. In addition, I could buy four of the Pilot refills for the price of one Waterman refill. The pen is back in my pocket, with a Pilot refill, and will remain there for a long time."
2,2 at best,"I agree with others, the Pilot G2 fits and writes better and is cheaper. The only reason I didn't rate it a '1' is my pen came with one and it wrote fine for a while. Bought refills and they were duds."
5,exactly as advertised,"exactly what i used to buy at stationary store, but for a lot less. there are cheaper brands (e.g. Foray), but i found the ink streams to be lighter and less smooth"
1,Never Received package,I have not received the product. The address didn't have my company name nor the suite # 2100. Maybe it was returned to you. Please contact me at 713-439-8263 to take care of this.
1,On Acid??,"This is the biggest pile of s..t I've ever had the displeasure to purchase. After listening to it and looking back at the reviews on this page, I've come to the conclusion that the other reviewers on this page are on the brown acid that destroys your ability to tell what is actually good music.This compilation consists entirely of titles that look good on the back of a CD cover but in reality are nothing but the worst tracks (sound or substance) by Hendrix, Chicago, Santana, Hawkwind, Can, Amon Duul, etc. Even the more obscure artists are represented by bad recordings, either poorly recorded live tracks or songs that could not possibly have ever been meant to see the light of day.This compilation was also released as In Search of Space: The Sixties To The Seventies and the reviews are more accurate at this linkIn Search of Space: The Sixties To The Seventiesthan the ones on this page.This thematically designed compilation is nothing close to what it says it is: a waste of money."
4,Interesting Mali Folk Music,"I throughly enjoyed this album. Great folk/blues/pop/world music. reminds me of 60's/70's american folk music. RIYL: Nick Drake, early REM, mellow folk rock. In the category of what the heck is this comes: Track #7 (LACOLI KARAMOGO) sounds exactly like ""Love Like a Man"" from Ten Years After album Cricklewood Green ... Weird but true!"
4,Fun and Effective,"I love this workout. The aerobics are challenging, but not too difficult to pick up after a few times, and the toning really works. It just tends to get boring when done as much as necessary to see results."
3,exhaustion,"I have been searching for a workout for so long now that would help me tone my legs without adding so much mass...well this video definitly toned my legs, adding 2 inches to my thighs..I cant fit in my jeans now! The aerobic part of it is a lot of confusing jumping around. I tried it twice, and now I just do the toning part...I combine this video with quick callanetics hips/behind....I must say the toning part is actually 'fun', and I enjoyed it...but i want a leaner look. I have been dieting also, so its not like ive been pigging out and wandering why the hell i got bigger thighs....If you are serious about losing weight, and creating a leaner look, TRY Body Flex by Greer Childs...I lost 40 lbs over the course of 3 -4 months doing this...Now im down to a weight that my body enjoys...but i do not...I still want to lose."
2,TOO DIFFICULT,"I HAVE NEVER BEFORE SEEN A WORKOUT TAPE THAT HAD A DIFFICULT DANCE ROUTINE TO KEEP UP WITH. I WAS EXHAUSTED TRYING TO DO SOME OF THE DANCE MOVEMENTS.I AM USED TO INSTRUCTORS WHO TELL YOU WHEN A MOVE IS GOING TO CHANGE OR HOW AN EXERCISE IS DONE. I FELT AS IF I WAS THROWN INTO A BROADWAY SHOW AND WAS NOT TAUGHT THE DANCE ROUTINE.YOU KNOW LIKE THE EPISODE WHEN LUCILLE BALL JOINED THE BALLET AND WAS FRAUSTRATING THE DANCE INSTRUCTOR BECAUSE SHE DID NOT KNOW THE ROUTINE. I AM A QUICK LEARNER AND HAVE BEEN DANCING ALL OF MY LIFE, BUT SOMEHOW THIS WAS TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME. AFTER FIVE MINUTES I WAS WINDED. YOU WOULD HAVE TO WATCH THIS TAPE SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE ROUTINE."
4,Wonderful book for those working with kids,"This was a great book for my counseling education. My internship experience was with children and adolescents in residential treatment from ages 6 to 18 years old. The text was concise enough to not be overwhelmed with information. However, it covered enough techniques that I had a number of different tricks in my bag to use with the kids."
2,Already know,I didn't find anything I didn't already know in this book. It did not help me to justify my interventions with reluctant teens or how to document the intervention.
1,"Tiny dice, not oversized","Typed in large dice, got these things. I ordered them before the other review was posted, but avoid purchasing for children, the dice themselves are small enough to go into the childrens mouths. I thought the small parts on these ""oversized, easy to grab"" dice would be the dots... it turns out the small parts are the dice themselves. The only upside to this debaucle is the false representation includes the number of dice, instead of a set of two, you get four dice... but it is four small dice."
1,Definitely not large dice!,"Typed in large dice and I found this. for $8, you would think it would be what it was described as. Will definitely be returning this."
5,THA REALNESS,"""EVEN THOU MAD ..... HATED/I REMAIN THE MOST ANTICIPATED."" THAT'S RIGHT, CORMEGA IS HERE WITH HIS FIRST SOLO ALBUM, FINALLY.ALL I CAN SAY IS, IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT BY NOW, WHAT YOU WAITING FOR?! BASICALLY THE WHOLE ALBUM IS HOT. IT IS A LIL SHORT BUT THAT JUST LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE, WHICH IS A GOOD THING. (LUCKILY I GOT BOTH ""BEST OF CORMEGA"" BOOTLEGS TO LISTEN TO.) TRACKS LIKE ""THUNS AND KIKOS"" FEATURING PRODIGY OF MOBB DEEP AND ""GET OUT OF MY WAY"" ARE REALLY HOT TRACKS. ""FALLEN SOLDIER"" AND ""FALLEN SOLDIER (REMIX)"" ARE NICE TRACKS. ONE IS ABOUT HIS MOMS AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT HIS FRIEND THAT DIED. SO, IF YOU LIKE REAL HIP HOP MUSIC, WHAT BETTER ALBUM TO PICK UP THAN ""THE REALNESS."" UNLIKE JAY Z'S ""BLUEPRINT"", ""THE REALNESS"" IS HOT."
4,Finally cormega's album is here!,"The year is 2001 and I never thought that cormega would ever come out with his album with all the bs, but the album is here and he is bringing heat! I gave it four stars only because he could have done better with his skills, but defjam unfortunately wouldn't let him have the songs.P.S if your reading this cormega good looking out for putting They forced my hand & and the other bonus song at the end with you and mobb deep (killa's theme). Keep doing your thing mega!"
3,"I listen to Nas, and you sir are no Nas!","I'm going to have to be careful about the reviews I read .... They seem to be overwhelmingly positive. I used reviews to help me decide to make this purchase. I didn't need much convincing, I have been dying to get my hands on ""Killaz Theme"" which comes as a bonus track on this CD. Cormega is aiight, but he isn't the second coming like the reviews would have you believe. And he definitely ain't qualified to even spit shine Nas' huge QB medallion. It's worth having, but the only songs that'll keep you coming back are Killaz Theme and ""They Forced My Hand""."
2,straight gabbage and i mean gabbage,"WITH ALL THE NOISE AND WAITING AND ANTICIPATING FOR A ALBUM THAT SUCKS IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER DROPPED THIS ISNT THE MEGA THAT I KNEW OF OLD THE PRODUCTION IS VERY POOR BUT U WOULD EXPECT THAT FROM AN INDEPENDENT LABEL THERE ARE A FEW JOINTS WORTH LISTENING TO LIKE ""FALLEN SOLDIERS"" ""THEY FORCED MY HAND"" AND ""AMERICAN BEAUTY"" THIS IS A RAPPER THAT HAS TO DEAL WITH ALOT OF PERSONAL PROBLEMS BEFORE HE SHOULD MAKE RECORDS OR ATLEAST FIND SOME WAY TO CHANNEL IT THROUGH UR MUSIC BETTER THAN THAT IT WOULD HELP."
5,So Good it kept me Happy,"I just got arrested the other night. I should be in a realllllllly bad mood, but this cd has kept me optimistic and happy. Cormega spits the realness on every song. Each song is well-produced and well-written. In a matter of a week, Cormega went from being a rapper I had barely heard to my favorite."
5,CLASSIC (with capital letters),"Mega is ILL! He got skills: just listen to the lyrics of ""American beauty"". The beats is slammin. The whole album is tight except for ""Get out my way"" which music I didn't feel opposite to the lyrics 'That Nas and Jay-Z beef didn't involve me'. That's tight! Mega is the n***a of the Next Millennium.My favorite tarcks are ""Dramatic entrance"" and ""The unforgiven"". TOLD: 5-stars!"
5,Real east coast hip hop!,"Do you remember when east coast hip hop was grimy and street level. Well before east coast rappers went pop-rap. The days of ""illmatic"", ""the sun risses in the east"", ""36 chambers"", ""the infamous"", ""nocturnal"", etc. While most rappers today have one hardcore New York sounding (Alchemist, Dj Premier, Rza) track and 14 other pop tracks, Cormega gives you 14 dope street tracks. If you hate the way rap is sounding in 2001, pick up this album for a return to the grimy New York vibe that is missing in rap today. Peace"
5,My son loves it,My husband has a similar one and my son wanted one too. Got this one for him for Christmas. He is very tall and weights 225lbs. His siblings had him do the strength test on it. He gingerly stepped on it because he didn't think it could hold his weight. No problem! Very sturdy.
5,I really like my Stack-On Step N Stor Tool Box,"I really like my Stack-On Step N Stor Tool Box. I am a retail merchandiser, resetting merchandise in grocery stores, I bought this particular tool box because it is not too heavy to carry, and I can use it as a tool box and a step stool to reach the items on higher shelves, all in one, it is all that I need to carry on the job. It is made good too, my tool box got hit by a fork lift, and all that happened to it was the clasp got bent!"
1,I could not grab this one,"I got this book prior to my two years stay in China. I was very interested in learning the language of this country and this book was supposed to help me.... but it did nothing in that way.The book is well done, very easy to grab and to follow but I was the problem I think. Mandarin is very hard to learn, takes times and I just got side track by learning yet another language."
2,Truly for a very specific group,"Unless you're an absolute beginning learner of Chinese or extremely interested in the minute details of the written language, this book will be somewhat of a disappointment.I learned Japanese for a year before moving on to Traditional Chinese, which most likely boots me right out of the intended demographic of this manual. It goes into great detail regarding the essentials, the pieces-parts, the make-up of Chinese characters but doesn't do much else. There are some drills, some write-what-you've-learned but nothing else. I was hoping for some really interesting etymological tidbits but I was sadly let down.If you're just starting, go ahead and get it, but it will become obsolete quickly as your thought-processes change and you begin to naturally and effortlessly write even the most ""complicated"" Chinese characters."
2,Stay away!,"This is only a very mediocre concert by Tangerine Dream. There are no classic tracks, and the sound quality isn't the best. As the other reviewer said, there's a lot of space on this disc for CD-ROM material, studio outtakes, and other objects of desire. I think ""Logos""(1982) is a far better live concert. ""Sohoman"" is the best example that pompous packaging can't make up a real lack in good music."
2,In a Vault for a Good Reason,"Sometimes the best thing for past material is to stay buried very deeply in a vault and this is the case with these live tracks recorded in 1982.This ""Classics Edition"" contains five pieces ranging from 4:31 (White Eagle) to 13:22 (Bondy Parade) from Edgar Froese, Christopher Franke and Johannes Schmoelling. There is a bootleg-like quality the way the listener is dropped into the opening number - Convention of the 24 - and there really is not anything special in the material that makes it a fascinating or historical release.Froese has been criticized over the years for reworking supposed live tracks with studio material and this may be his way at firing back at those who question that process. But no matter the reason, the live set adds nothing to the incredible legacy of the legendary band."
1,Remember when TD had vision and distinction?,"This pointless release seems to be yet another in an endless onslaught of sub-par ""lost"" recordings that have no business being found.There's nothing on ""Sohoman"" that hasn't been heard before and much better. Obviously the pieces played here are not being ""Played"" at all but just recordings PRESENTED live, which is something [...] Froese and Co. started doing in the eighties. [....] anybody can do that.Classic, vintage Tangerine Dream is long,long gone. All there is left now are scraps and memories. It may be time for ol' Ed to shut down his computers and call it a life.(Musically, anyway)"
2,Inadequate Information,"I am a competitive athlete as well as a physician, going through my first pregnancy. I've been devouring a good number of textbooks relating to maternal fitness, and this one is the weakest I've read yet.The text is poorly written and uninspiring, with typographical errors liberally mixed throughout. The exercises shown are standard strength training exercises, and very little insight is offered as to the benefits one might receive by doing them.For the beginner or untrained athlete, this book might offer some useful information, but the reviews here led me to believe that a trained athlete might find this book useful. These reviews were incorrect."
5,Wonderful Story!,"We purchased this book along with Felicty Wishes Secrets and Surprises and Felicity Wishes Snowflakes and Sparkledust. My daughter and I LOVE them! The stories are precious and the pop ups and flaps are wonderful for my four year old to handle. The characters are whimsical - Holly (the Christmas Fairy), Daisy (the Spring Fairy), Polly (the Tooth Fairy), etc. The stories are engaging and teach compassion and kindness."
4,The Crooked Letter State got that FIREWATER!,"Coming out of Mississippi, you don't hear much from us until now. This Grey Skies album is as good as any album out of the south and even better. Out of 17 songs, at LEAST 13 are bumpin. Amongst the best are: Firewater, Get Crunk, Tupelo, Chicken, and Trill As It Gets. If you have any negetive opinions about this album, keep it 2 yoself. If you deny these boys their glory and opportunity to shine you ani't nutthin but a hater. We can look forward to these playaz to drop more and even tighter cuts. Mississippi ain't dead ya heard what I said. From Meridian to Jackson, to Biloxi and back them Mississippi playaz puttin the state on the map."
4,Highly Recommended & Different,"This album is not your typical southern rap album. It consists of smart and witty lyrics. This album came out before David Banner was famous (and he is much better in this album). It has great, trippy lil' beats and is a great album for when your just cruising around town or when your just relaxing. Overall I was very impressed due to the fact that Im not a big rap fan, and even though I typically listen to more of the Beatles or the Pixies, I found this album to be especially enjoyable!!!"
5,Operating manual for opera attendance,"Having read about a dozen books that tout themselves as introductions to opera, I found ""Opera 101"" to be perhaps the most intriguing of the bunch. In an ever-so-slight way, it is at times a bit preachy and a bit overobvious. You will feel occasionally like you are in a high-school music appreciation class, or reading an operating manual. On the other hand, Plotkin leaves absolutely nothing out, and no stone unturned, and for that he is to be commended. Every possible question is answered, and answered thoroughly. In addition, the appendices are chock full o' valuable information (a list of all the major and mid-major opera houses all over the world; books for further reading; recommended CD recordings and DVD filmings; etc.). And you have the feeling at all times that Ploktin knows what he's talking about.This is the PERFECT book for any adult who knows absolutely zilch about opera but who wants to learn it all, and learn it all out of a single source."
5,"""Opera 101: A Complete Guide to Learning & Loving Opera"" by Fred Plotkin","I first read parts of this work at the library, and was so interested in having the information at my fingertips that I wanted my own copy. I was able to purchase a slightly used copy from Amazon at a discounted price, with free shipping when I combined it with another product.I appreciate the wonderful service!"
2,Eleven operas are described within a historical context.,"The book's title can lead to misunderstanding. If you want to learn about opera from ""scratch"", if you don't mind being tought how to purchase a ticket for instance. Other items in the book (for instance the ""complete"" list of opera houses over the world) are maybe for rather advanced operagoers. For a musician there are definitly more useful books and the far too often used term COMPLETE makes me really sick - what word are they going to use if eventually something will be complete!?"
3,Not my favorite but a good workout,"I have the Firm's Body Sculpting Systems I, II, and IV. Out of the sculpting oriented tapes of those systems (Body Sculpt, Super Body Sculpt, Total Sculpt Plus Abs, and Supercharged Sculpting), here's what I like and don't like.Like: the length, the choice of movesDon't like: the lunges using the Fanny Lifter (who can do that?), the ab work using the sculpting stick, how slowly Jen breaks down each move, Jen's aerobic choreography (it just seems old-ladyish and not very effective to me)Since Body Sculpt in BSS1 I've felt like Jen tried too hard to use the gadget of the month to do moves. We end up doing moves, especially stretches, awkwardly that we could do easily without the Fanny Lifter, Sculpting Stick, or Transfirmer. It seems like she feels this obligation to use the equipment as much as possible which other instructors don't."
1,Too Much Equipment,"I have used the Firm Videos for over 12 years now.I know that the fanny lifter and variable weights are an important part of the workout, but the sculpting stick is a waste. They seem to have to find ways of using it so you'll have to purchase one. This video is not the best at sculpting. The older Firm tapes are much more challenging, especailly Firm Cardio and Firm Strength. This is my least favortie of Firm Videos I've tried."
4,Great summer music!,"I bought this CD a few years ago and have never regretted it. It's great summertime music whether you're at the beach, on your deck or in the backyard."
1,it is the wrong KEY WEST !,..Don't be fooled!This CD is not from the famous KEY WEST (duo) which was in Charts 1999-2000...
5,Love it!,"My 9-year-old daughter loves it. According to me this is too easy for her, but she was very excited to learn many new things and she insisted on reading them to me. If your kid loves animals, they will definitely love this book."
1,Outdated and Of Little Use,"This was probably a fine book back 2001, but unless you are still using Visual Basic 6, it won't do you any good. The methods and data types in the examples are often no longer supported in later versions of VB."
1,SLOW SHIPPING!!!!! ITEM NOT AS DESCRIBED!!!!,"I was sent a notice that the item was shipped on September 12th and didnt receive the item till october 6th. I emailed the seller and never received a response. The item was listed as in used condition, but it was an old library copy, complete with permanent marker scribbled over the name of the library and teh spine of the book was split. Will not use this seller again."
1,Fell apart,"We had this flag for about a month before it started to come apart. The stitching on the flag started to fray and then the stripes would start coming apart. By the end, almost all of the stripes were coming apart about 6inches up each strip. We had it for about 3 months, if even, before we had to get ride of it. If you want a flag outside on a daily basis...this is not it. I have used several types as flags, as we are a military family and take great pride in flying our flag, and this is the worst one I have used."
4,Flag's to the war,"I received the flag's in Iraqi in about a week. The company was great thanks. All things considered, I will buy from this company again."
4,"Reasonable Price, Solid Construction","I bought this flag to decorate one of the walls of my residence.Good: Durable construction, fast shipping, good coloring, inspires pride in this great country.Bad: There were a few fraying stitches that I had to cut off of the flag before displaying it. The stitching had been pulled out a bit an the area was 'fuzzy'. (This was nothing that my knife could not fix in 15 seconds but, it was unexpected.)I would recommend this product to a friend.Support the troops! God Bless The USA!"
5,Thank you America!,"Thank you America for making such a well made, durable American flag at such a great price! I am proud to display the symbol of our country and what it stands for, and know that it was made in America."
2,At least it was POORLY made in the USA...,"I installed my new flag on July 4th...within 3 months it was rather tattered and worn on the end. After another month, one of the grommets had completely separated from the 'sturdy part' of the flag itself and the flag would no longer fly. Apparently, central Indiana is a very harsh environment in which to fly a flag. Fine. Next time, I will get one that is a little more robust.I contacted Annin (via their website) to let them know that I didn't feel that the flag had lasted very long. I received a very prompt response; they merely stated that 'a nylon flag will last approx 3-4 months, which is the standard established by the National Flag Foundation'. That's all...no recommendation, or anything, for which replacement flag I should possibly consider for the harsh Indiana climate. Way to support your product!My replacement flag will be purchased from ANOTHER American flag maker."
1,Not an Annin Flag,The flag that I received was not an Annin flag. It was some cheap flag that I could have bought at my local grocery store. I ordered it from RSS Products fulfilled by Amazon. I don't know if it was just them or if all the sellers will ship a non Annin flag under this item.
2,Only lasted 17 months,"The flag was very nice when I received it, but it only lasted 17 months. Within 12 months it was heavily faded, especially in the blue. After 17 months it tore apart from the wind."
5,Good!,"I was worried by some reviews that the quality would disappoint, but it DID NOT. Nice, just what I was looking for."
4,Beautiful American Flag,This flag will stand strong Kansas winds and hold its color and not fray. Several viewers have noted special look and feel of this flag and inquired about it and its availability. You won't be disappointed with this investment. We fly this flag proudly at our Community Center
5,High Quality Flag,"Very nice, high quality flag. Stitching looks very strong and colors are vibrant. The embroidered stars add a nice touch. I'm proud to fly this flag from my home."
5,Buy this one,I have had the cheap ones that are printed .This is NOT one of them. It has been up for about a month in above norm winds and its great. The other one Not this one only lasted a week. This was a great price and its made well.
5,Good value,The flag arrived quickly. It appears to be a good quality nylon flag and at a very good price point.
1,Poor quality for an outdoor flag,"I purchased this specific flag because it talked about being an outdoor flag. I've had it flying outside my window now for a couple of weeks. During that time, we've had sun, rain, snow, and wind; all weather I expect a flag to endure. However, I'm already seeing damage to the flag. The stars area has significant damage and it looks like it is slowly becoming white in that entire area. From the road, the flag looks fine. From 10 feet away, you can see how poor it looks. I'm incredibly disappointed and expect I'll have to replace it."
2,Did not receive genuine Annin flag!,"I see I am not the only one who is receiving US flags that are similar to Annin Nyl-Glo flags, but are not. They are cheaper, the grommets don't hold up, there is no Annin or Nyl-Glo logo anywhere, and to add to the disgrace, my flag actually came with permanent marker or ink or a black stain on one of the white stripes.I have kept this flag indoors in my office and will be wary of buying from here again. I bought it from BC novelties and this wasn't the only defaced flag they sent. So others should be wary when ordering this flag or from this company. You may not get a new or even an Annin Nyl-Glo flag.I'm just disappointed, no stores near me seem to have any good US flag for sale and more and more, online sellers are sending cheap made in China flags of which there is no bigger disgrace to buy a US flag made in China."
1,Incredibly Disappointed,"Flag is made of very thin material. Embroidery on stars was unraveling. A grommet was missing, leaving a gaping hole in the flag. Incredibly poor quality... is this really American made? Where's the pride?"
2,Shredded to strips in half a year,"Looked good for about 4 months, then started tearing along the stripes and in few more months fell apart. Yes, it gets a bit windy in Chicago, but this is just very bad quality flag."
2,Moldy,"When I opened the package, I could immediately smell mold. Upon unfolding the flag, I found that the red color had bled into the white, indicating that the flag was probably made with cheap dye, and that it had been wet for some ammount of time. I wish I had spent a little more and gotten something worth the money."
3,"Still looks good, Grommet popped out...","This is a beautifully made flag and it it still looks great, but one day I came home and noticed it was hanging strangely. Upon further inspection, i saw that the metal grommet had popped out. I was able to find the pieces and pressed them back together and using a metal washer I put it back on the flag pole.Less than a week later, it fell out again. This flag is less than 1 year old! I usually take it in on days that we are windy. My other flags have lasted YEARS. Disappointed in this one."
4,3x5NUSAF,"We have used for a few weeks, it seems to hold well in high winds. Has not yet lost the color."
2,flag,Flag looks oknot sure were it was madeCould buy same type of flag at any store for same amount and be sure it was made in U.S.A
5,Well made,"The stars are embroidered and the stripes are also sewn together, not printed on the fabric. I'm not using it for outdoor use so I can't speak for that aspect of it but it looks great hanging from a wall."
5,"Excellent product, excellent price","The flag is beautiful! Flying high right now! for anyone wishing to buy a flag, this one is exactly as described. Fast shipping. I am so happy, thank you!"
5,GREAT FLAG,Very nice flag for the price! the stars are all embroidered. Very good quality! I would certainly buy this again!
5,Went up quickly and does just what it should.,This worked out great allowing me change presentation position of flags. I hung from the deck rail of my home.
5,Excellent flag for the price..very colorful..true to the description,I bought this flag for my parents to replace the one they had for over 40 years. I was impressed with fast shipping and product was exactly as described. Very colorful...nice stitching...i found no flaws...I would highly recommend as price was so affordable.
2,Flags not quality,"I bought several of these for an event. At least one of the flag's stars were visible through the package as having the sewing coming undone - as in it looked like half the star was unsewed. It is unusable in a shadow box for the event. Spend a little more and get quality flags that can be used, this one is unusable."
1,Flag received is not the product pictured or described by seller.,"I am very disappointed that instead of receiving the flag described (Sewn Stripes and Embroidered Stars) I received a vinyl flag with printed stars and stripes. I purchased this as a gift, and since I don't have time to exchange it before the birthday - I have to give him the one that I received."
1,flag gromets failed,"gromets failed after short time. quality in flag was good, butneed better reinforcing on the grometsthe overall quality of the flag was good. i wish the company that i purchased this from would send a replacement as i fly this flag every day"
1,Bad Flag,Ripped to shreds in 6 months. I did not like this product. Would not buy. I do live on a high wind hill.
5,VERY good!!,"I received the Flag promptly. It is great -- especially for the price. I will order 1 or 2 more, soon."
1,Disappointed,"We are very disappointed in the quality of the flag. I Bought this flag in Aug 2012, but it did not last two months and have had to replace it already. We leave our flags out 24/7 and they usually last a lot longer, however this flag tore quickly along the right side of the flag all the way to the middle of the flag to the point that it looked shredded."
4,American Flag,This was a nice flag for the price! But the quality was not a nice as I was use to! I have been ordering my flags for the company that makes the metal flag poles for installation in your yard!
2,Shredded too,"While it's not a terrible flag, and it might work for others in different situations, ours is shredded after only 4 months of use. We have it on a spinning pole so that it would adapt more easily to changing winds, but it didn't seem to help.I was initially disappointed when it came in a small bag, tightly folded. The creases in the folds never did go away after being hung out for months. Closer inspection now shows that the material is very thin where the creases were.Colors were VIVID when the flag came. Now, they are still bold, but showing signs of fading. Again, only 4 months since.Unlike another user, it does have the embroidered stars (not printed), but I've got two foot rips going up the flag now and our winds haven't been THAT bad this year.Going to try out one of the Annin flags next and hope we get more for our money."
2,Annin flag,Not sure flag is brand advertised. Has no label like other Annin flags. Emailed seller but no response. Flag has been flying off and on for less than 30 days and is ripping already
3,NOT Made in the USA,"Not a bad flag, but was disappointed to find a ""Made in Pakistan"" label on it. I would not have bought it if had been advertised as not being made domestically. I really do not appreciate misleading advertising."
5,"Nice quality, Good price!",This flag has a very secure edge on the end to keep it from splitting apart over time. It has a strong hem with multiple stitching. I bought it as a gift for a friend whose flag has ripped apart at the end over time. I'm sure he will like this flag!
5,"Great Buy, Quality Flag",I purchased this for my inlaws as a grand parent's day gift. The quality is excellent and the shipping was very speedy. They were very happy with it.
1,No Workout At All!,"This tape is full of prissy dancey steps, and half the time he isn't even on the bench! If you want to do some sissy shimmying instead of working out, buy this tape. If you want to exercise, go elsewhere! Several of his transitions even seem unsafe, particularly the turn flow into the V-step. If he were half as worried about giving you a workout as he is about being so perky, this tape would be killer! As it is, I'm afraid, the only thing killed was my wallet by wasting my money on this worthless junk!"
4,Jam with The Man,"Ok,ok, so besides the fact that females viewers get to gaze at this gorgeous, graceful man for 30 minutes;this video is definitely worth your money. It departs from your run-of-the-mill step workout in that the moves are fresh,the live drumming infectious,and the latin twist towards the end keeps your energy level peaked.Two big toes up Kendell!"
2,Too dancy!,"I'm an intermediate-advanced exerciser, and I was rather unimpressed with this video's athletic content. It focuses too much on doing ""dancy"" footwork and not enough on athletic moves, therefore it does not keep my heartrate high enough. Good for a beginner or someone who wants to exercise moderately, but if you want a vigorous workout, this one isn't for you!"
3,Fun video for the time crunched...,"This is a good video when time is short. The cuing isn't great, and the background exercisers whoop and holler a lot, but the workout is solid. You get out what you put in with these fairly simple steps. Kendall is motivating and energetic, and the live drumming is great fun. I recommend it for beginner to intermediate exercisers who are familiar with step."
2,"If you still have a VCR, this is great!","I was looking for a CD, not a VHS. I had a VHS with Kendell Hogan step aerobics which I loved. I wanted it on a CD. When I got it, it was VHS. I guess I was so excited about finding it that I hadn't seen that it was not in the format I needed. I can't even believe that VHS is still being sold at merchants online today."
4,"Fun, Exciting Workout","This is one of my favorite step videos. Kendall Hogan keeps you moving and motivated. If you are new to stepping this isn't a good video to start with because a lot of the time he doesn't give you any warning about new moves or the sequences. But if you are an intermediate to advanced stepper then after doing the video a couple of times you will be able to follow along no problem. At times the combos use simple moves that don't keep your heartrate up, but if you are intermediate to advanced stepper you will know how to modify the moves to make them higher intensity. I only wish he would stop for a water break or to check your heartrate or intensity level.I highly recommend this video to intermediate to advanced steppers if you want to sweat and burn calories. This is an awesome workout!"
3,Oddly unsatisfying,"I am a fan of Crunch tapes but find this one a little annoying. Cueing is inconsistent -- sometimes on time, sometimes a beat late to follow -- and it can be hard to make out what he's saying over the music and drums. Choreography is fun but the workout ends just as I'm getting going. I wish they had put all the segments together at the end for a full routine. I'll probably stick with the tape just to master the choreography, but for a 30-minute step workout I much prefer Reebock Versa Dance Step."
5,Kendell Hogan,"If you want one of the very best instructor for step please buy this CD. I think that his timing, music and energy is the very best for long term viewing."
3,Definitely not for the beginner stepper,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with stepping, but my fitness and coordination are pretty good and I found this workout to be too complicated. It was hard to keep up with the footwork, although I was barely breathing hard at all. The sequences change fairly quickly so once you ""get it"", they're on to a different footwork sequence. If you love step workouts and are experienced with stepping, you'd probably like this video. If you're just looking for a change of pace from non-step workouts, you may want to look elsewhere."
5,this is a great book about great people,"i have read this book two times, it has its funny times and it has its emotional times you smile and cry at the same time. this book has alot of good life lessions, such as patience,investments,and living life to its fullest. not only is it a good book, but farmer and betty are all around good people."
4,Why is the picture of the panel look all weird....?,Anyways I was thinking about getting this for my friend's son's Power Wheel. because the dam thing is always dying and when it does he's looks sader then one of the kids on the feed the children commercials. so any thoughts internet people of this working....?
2,lacks depth,"I tend to agree with reviewer from Sunnyvale, Ca. I am currently on page 85 of book, and have been informed perhaps ten times, that Joan is a. obbsessed with movies and, for some unknown reason, enamoured of cooking....and that Emma is artistic, by reason of carrying around a sketch pad , musically inclined, so far one sentence to that effect; and also studious and full of wanderlust to see captols of the world..for me, none of the characters in the book seem particularly interesting due to lack of depth. If this were an layperson's autobiographical memoir of a childhood in wartime Hong Kong, I would find it much more engrossing for the insights into two particular young girl's lives, but I believe literature demands more of a professional writer."
3,"""Dream"" is a snooze","My book club selected this book because Tsukiyama is one of our favorite authors. Compared to her other novels like Samurai's Garden, Language of Threads and Women of the Silk, Tsukiyama's Night of Many Dreams does not have a compelling story line - mildly interesting, but not a page-turner. It's defintiley not one of her best efforts. Ironically, the title seems to have nothing to do with the tale, except that reading the book might make you snooze."
3,Latter part of novel was disappointing,"I have read two of Tsukiyama's historical novels and liked them. In so far as ""Night of Many Dreams"" is an historical novel, emphasizing lives in the midst of historical events, I found it equally good. Unfortunately, in the latter part of the novel history and place (i.e. San Francisco) play less of a role, and Tsukiyama's talents do not seem to translate, leaving the reader with very ordinary writing. She does do a good job in evoking the comforts of a strong family connection."
2,Not her best work,"Gail Tsukiyama is a gifted writer with the ability to relate a complex story simply and beautifully. Unfortunately this was not evident in this book. None of the characters ever really came to life or reached their hinted at dreams or potential. Despite some level of vision, insight, independence and drive, no one was able to change the ""fate"" that was so often mentioned. One might argue that this was done deliberately as some commentary on people, society and contemporary literature, but I am not sure this is the case. Full of repetitious stereotypes and undeveloped ideas, I would never recommend this as an inspiring story of strong women or families. ""Dreaming Waters"", Tsukiyama's latest, is a much better read."
2,Disappointing,"I really thought from the description of the book that it would be a great story. But despite the fact that the characters and setting lend themselves to an interesting story, the author doesn't seem to write very well. I tired of this book very quickly and just read it to find out what happened to everyone in the end. If you're interested in novels about women's relationships (such as sisters) in an Asian setting, I highly recommend Divakaruni's ""Sister of My Heart."""
3,"Good story line, but lacked character development","Though the book was written from the perspective of several of the main characters, I never felt that I got to know them. The book seemed to go from event to event in a hurried fashion. The story line was interesting, but lacked depth. The Samurai's Garden is a much better read."
4,dodge part hunting,The book is very helpful for parts you don't have and need. It's great to look up the part I need for my Challengers and find other cars that have the exact same thing. Some of the things I have needed I have found on up to 15 different cars. I have used it faithfully since I've purchased it. The only downfall is that it isn't 100% complete. There was a few items I needed that had no listing for the interchange when there should have been. Regardless of that one problem the book is still well worth the money. Now they need a book to cover my 66 Charger.
1,Chrysler Muscle - Still a Mystery!,"If you see a part at a swap meet, auction or garage sale you want to know if it will work with your motor. This Parts Interchange Manual won't help! Take carbs, for example. This manual lists 141 interchange numbers with NO REVERSE INDEX. Want to know if you should bid on that 4671A for your six pack? Scan every one of 141 listings until you come to 4671A at number 124. Now all you know is it was stock on eight models and which ones those are. Will it work on that Mopar Performance intake you just bought? Who knows? Will it bolt onto anything other than the eight listed models? Who knows?If someone is buying a ""right"", frame off restoration or trying to complete one then this book has a purpose for them. If, like me, you want to turn your stock Mopars into Stage III or Stage IV performers, this book is useless."
3,Another style,Great easygoing instruction. Good playing. Pretty much for any level.The booklet missing the full songs and not complete.
4,mine,"Just a travel bag that fits over your golf bag, no special features. Used it once on air trip, worked just fine, no damage. Clubs will bang around some if you don't pad them. For the price it works just fine."
3,Okay for occasional travel.,"The material of the bag was very durable and held up great through the baggage process at the airport. My clubs came through without a scratch. However, the carry strap broke the first day I had it. It is a decent bag for occasional use."
3,not for me,"I'm a big fan of Pentel P205s, which are basically a cheaper version of this with a non-retractable sleeve. I thought I'd try this to reduce the pencil poking me in my pocket. This pencil is not really designed for that, and (no surprise) it doesn't really reduce pokes. I'll stick with my P205s."
3,Series just isn't grabbing me yet.,"Natsuki Takaya, Fruits Basket vol. 4 (Tokyopop, 1999)Note: meeting more of the zodiac in each volume is not helping with the fact that we can't tell some of them apart already. I'm also hoping that, eventually, a real storyline is going to show up; Takaya has hinted at it a few times, but nothing has really emerged as a big story arc yet. I'm still soldiering on, but it's not catching me in the same way many manga series do. ***"
4,fruits basket4,My favorite yet. I love the little side notes the wither adds even if they are usually compleatly off topic. The book makes me wonder when is tohru gonna start dating one of them and will it be Yukon or kyo BTW IF U LIKE FRUITS BASKET. TRY THE TRANSLUCENT BOOKS
1,P-U -- Everyone is one-dimentional! Save your money!,"Franklin -- always upbeat! Never a down moment in the entire novel; in fact, in his entire career! Is this believable? And he told story after story ""out of school."" Delighted in it; in fact. A different time, I know, but... Good Lord! Is it true that FDR was such a ... gossip? Such an unlikeable person? Who could EVER trust this man as a friend? If he told such stories about others, wouldn't he tell them about you? The book is unbelievable. Everyone is one-dimentional. FDR -- stand-up-comic about everything confidential in his administration; Eleanor, saint personified... as, of course is Lucy. Geeze! Some truth, some revelations about the REAL people, would be interesting! Save your bucks. You'll learn nothing here."
2,there's no there there,"Reads like a high school sophomore rhapsodizing about her middle school crush. I hope she was not as unlikeable in reality. Want to read about Franklin and Eleanor? There are many good, substantive books out there including the new one (Franklin and Eleanor) by Hazel Rowley"
2,Romance Novel,"The following clip sums this book up:""He'd spent the day juggling half a dozen problems here and abroad, but that small oval cutout in my shirtwaist kept distracting him. That cutout, he said, was his window on the world.""There were some nice moments in this book, but too much heaving bodice for me. If you like historical romance, you'll probably really enjoy this book. It is a cut above in that respect.If you want depth, it will annoy you. Historical facts are not seamlessly woven into the narrative, and stand out as if cut and pasted. Feldman tries, has brief success, but ultimately fails to bring the peices of FDR, Eleanor, and Lucy to a full bodied life."
5,great live show compilation cd set,"This set contains 2 cd discs full of great songs from Anais' show in Marseille. This artist covers a full range of musical genres from rap to american blues with a flair all her own. This disc set even has a bonus: when played on the computer, it contains video clips. If you like a wide range of music, then this is the cd for you. Just so you know, even though this is a two disc set, most of the songs on the second disc are different versions of songs already covered."
5,The 2000 Year Old Man Goes to School,Wonderful humor for the kids and the parents and delighful illustrations
1,Stay far away! Shame on a teacher who would use this.,"I'm a teacher and I would never use this book in class. It's ridiculous, inaccurate in the extreme and worst of all, not remotely funny. The jokes were written over 50 years ago and have not aged well. My daughter didn't think it was funny either and she's 5. It makes fun of Robin Hood, one of her favorites. Knights of the ""oval"" table. Shakespeare's bad penmanship? These are funny? Making fun of a man who's burning to death in a kids book? That may have been funny in 1960, but in 2012 I call it grotesque."
2,Good set to have,I bought this for my daughter that is handicapped because she loves dogs. She really loves watching the old Lassie shows. The only drawback about the DVDs is that it is not continuous running from one show to another. Everytime a show ends it takes you back to the main menu.
3,Lassie 50th Anniversary,"I truly enjoyed the first disc with the original pilot and early shows, I cried during every one! However, the selection of shows deteriorated with the 2nd, and especially, the 3rd disc. It's almost worth it, just for the early shows, but it was disappointing."
3,Lassie 50th anniversdary,"I grew up with JEFF and Lassie, frankl;y, never got over Timmy replacing Jeff...Timmy was a goodie 2 shoes, unreal kid...I bought the video only to see jeff aND ITS DISSAPOINTING TO HAVE SUCH LIMITED SHOWS OF jEFF...Jeff was real and advnturous, I hope someday someone releases the entire original JEFF and Lassie series...I am 63 years old, they need to hurry up!!!"
4,Quality copy to DVD.,No loss of quality going to DVD. A great series my own kids can now enjoy. Not nearly enough quality programing on the tube today. This definately helps.
2,What a huge disappointment!,"Seeing that this was a Sony release, I had high expectations concerning quality. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed.For starters, the opening credits before each episode do not necessarily reflect the credits ORIGINALLY shown with the episode. A 1968 episode, for example, has an opening scene with a 1974 copyright!!! Given that this is a mainstream release, and not a public domain release, this is pretty unforgiveable!Secondly, the pictures have obviously not gone through any kind of restoration. The color episodes are particularly rough looking. The black and white are okay, though nothing great.I might also add that I am disappointed in the small number of later episodes included in the set. (Not near as much as not having the episodes in their original form, however.)"
4,"Good DVD, brings back memories","My wife and I really enjoy these DVD's. It really brings back good memories, my wife and I grew up with Lassie (and we have a collie). I didn't agree with the reviwers who said how bad the Video quality was, granted, it wasn't as good as a DVD made today, but it really wasn't bad either. Ahhhhh, when life was simple and everyone was so good, seems so naive, To go back to those good ole days!!! Enjoy it, we certainly did!"
1,"disappointing dvd, but the movie is great...","Having seen the movie multiple times, I was very disappointed with the production of this DVD. Scenes have been cut, for example, a mesmerizing nunchaku demonstration from the killer, and some bizarre editing happened: Tom Berenger is beat up by cops in the movie, and that was edited in the dvd, a stripper's dog howls when killed by the psychopath, and that also doesn't appear in the DVD. I am going to sell this ASAP, and buy the much better produced UK edition, which, strangely enough, features all the missing scenes."
1,I could have guessed the temperature better...,"Put your $25 toward some other, functional thermometer. This one was a huge disappointment. I verified it was more than thirty (30) degrees off in my first, now only, practical application. What a disaster!"
4,great item,"Love this timer. Works great for everything. Took me a bit to learn to set the temp for a seperate item than preprogrammed items but now that I know, I love it."
4,Works Great,"Lately when my husband cooked on the grill, our meat was either not cooked enough or practically well done! I decided I needed to find a tool he would like well enough to use...This Item did the trick. It works great! We've used it on the grill as well as on top of the stove. Maybe the other two review people had faulty units, but our works just the way it should."
4,"good book, but..","i can most accurately compare this book to having good sex with a partner who takes too long.it starts out great and is for most of the time, then suddenly, you climax and have to wait for him. then it's over and you're thinking, 'ok.. now what?'overall though, i thought it was great. i mean, the beginning especially.. i was a little disappointed that there was never a sex scene between the more important characters, but i easily got over that because of the reality of the affection.--great details, descriptions, etc.. but a very large, unrelated, fairly boring and obnoxiously tangential plot was very discouraging.with this review, i'm only preparing for the worst. though readers will have to suffer a few literary inadequacies, the book as a whole is an amazing journey that i would recommend any and all embark upon."
3,pretty good,"If the book had finished as strong as it started, I would have given it five stars. The first half of the book covers two days, the other half months. It almost seemed to me that Ashley felt the need to keep it under a certain amount of pages 'or something.'A lot of the writing here is above average. The dialog is a little off sometimes but the characters are well developed, almost too so. Some of the family lineage was lost on me, it didn't have to be 'that' in depth.All in all it's a good read. I'll definatly buy the next offering."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"Let me begin by saying that I worked on this movie for three days. The script had a water mark ""Final Draft 7 Demo"" insignia on it, not a good start. This movie offends me it's so bad. There's about 15 minutes worth of footage that advances the story with about 50 minutes of rap songs, free styling, jirating of the gludius maximus, and horrible, horrible acting. I know how the horror film genre is supposed to work, it's supposed to be fun, fast, and exciting. You know that show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""? They could win Emmy upon Emmy if they watched this pile of crap. I'll put you this, here's an ACTUAL line from the movie. ""I am sorry your friends are dying!"". Are you serious?If you buy this movie, make sure you have a lot of guange on you, it's fun to watch like that, but as an actual movie, a lot of good film was wasted."
1,UGH...RU 4REAL!,"Ok, first off, I am all for supporting black made movies but this one, come on now!! It comes across as though a bunch of friends got together and said ""Hey, let's make a horror movie!""...LOL...I'm convinced this was shot in one day, bypassing the editing phase."
2,April Fools Sike,Ok I love the actors from other movies that they have played in. But this movie I did not like them in this movie it was to ghetto.
1,SERIOUSLY BAD!!!!,"This is such a bad movie. Most of it seem to be in slow motion. The actors lack emotions There was no fear from these teenagers that are noticing their friends getting killed. The ""missy"" girl act like she wasn't scared to death..come on, beating up a man with his height and size!! Bomb movie, bomb acting, bomb waste of money."
2,Cheap for a reason!,I bought this product to go along with everything else I had to do my own nails. I thought by getting OPI the quality would be higher. I was wrong. The pads werent put on the block evenly so corners were coming off. the grit was rather soft. Next time ill find something different.
2,Ouch...,"Wow, now that was bad wasn't it?Somewhat marketed as a horror film but really an action thriller bordering on troma level acting and dull dialogue. When Sam Raimi makes appearances in movies, he is usually funny or at least fitting in, but here he is just exhibiting plain old bad acting in a film that I don't think should be associated with Evil Dead/Intruder etc, just because it has Sam Raimi.So if you are a horror fan that is expecting some lost classic slasher/gore film featuring some of the crew from Evil Dead then beware, because all you really get from this film is a C-rate action flick with some minor gore. Bah"
1,I like Sam Raimi But...,"This movie was just awful. It had the look and feel of being made by high school students. It was not funny, or interesting and really did not have anything worth mentioning to encourage you to watch it. I would have given it a one except I realized, it could have been worse. Nah, it could not have been worse, it is a one."
1,why bother...,"Are you kidding? I can't believe anyone with a brain would remotely suggest that this film has any type of viewing pleasure. Read the title... yes, that's right, no your not dreaming, read it again out loud... There, that should sum up why you should never give this film the time of day. I saw this film by mistake on television and literally have panic attacks at the thought of how much better off I would be if I hadn't. I could feel myself getting dumber with every second. Do I really need to say it? Ok, here it goes, don't waste your time. Then again, the fact that your here reading this review doesn't say much..."
5,"Really bad, but entertaining","Ahh, Sam Raimi and the gang in their $4,000 Vietnam epic. This is THE worst movie ever, but it's also entertaining, so it makes up for it. Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except has a lot of problems: The lighting, the script, the odd stock footage mixed with acting to make everything feel out of place...but, it's stupid in an A-Team sort of way, which is good. Not brillant, but worth a look."
3,"Humor in the vein of ""The Evil Dead""","""Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except"" is yet another obscure movie remastered by the video gods at Anchor Bay. The plot follows a group of war heroes, fresh out of Vietnam, who end up battling a cult of Charles Manson types in a small town. This may sound like a serious plot (like a revenge movie), but it's really not. Actually, this movie is more of a slapstick comedy than anything, and like all comedies, it wears a little thin upon repeated viewings. ""Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except"" comes from the same core group (Sam Raimi, Josh Becker, Bruce Campbell) that worked on ""The Evil Dead,"" so if you appreciated the humor in that movie, you'll most likely get a kick out of this one. I personally found it superior to that overrated shocker."
5,Wonderful movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, I believe it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The sound mixing was excellent, along with the directing. kudos."
4,A great tale of morality,"This DVD edition brings new life into an already great film. Scenes that were barely visible in the old VHS copies are now crystal clear. Be warned, however, that the audio commentary from co-writer Bruce Campbell and director Josh Becker, though occasionally insightful and consistently entertaining, does not give this film the credit it deserves. This is a very good film."
3,Fans will flip over this release. Others....,"I don't know if there has ever been or ever will be a movie quite like Thou Shalt Not Kill....Except. An exploitation film to be sure, but not completely action and not completely horror. Viewers will find many things to be offended by from this movie unless they see it for what it is: an trashy send-up of John Wayne movies. The Blu-ray release is stellar and includes many great extras, not the least of which is the short film Stryker's War (which was shot on Super-8 film and stars Burn Notice's Bruce Campbell) which was used to raise money for the feature-length movie. If you are already a fan of this movie, it is worth every dime and then some."
4,Great Cleaning Tool,I had to replace a previous one - it was worn out! The only negative is this one is smaller than the old one by at about 2 inches. Either they carry these in multiple sizes or they downsized the one they manufacture. This would be my only 'watch out' for you if you are replacing an older one.
2,UNGER,WILL NOT EVER ORDER THIS PRODUCT AGAIN I BELIEVED IT WOULD BE JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY CLEANING.BAD PRODUCT
3,Not the one I expected,"While your service was excellent, the DVD did not contain the scene in it I was looking for that has become a family punch line over the years. So I purchase a DVD I didn't want really.~Lece"
5,The best Louie,"My wife had mentioned seeing this standup with me a long time ago. Searched Amazon, and there it was. This is the best Louie, clean comedy, and funny like comedy should be."
3,OK but not great,"I was nice to see an older video of Louie. Although some of the material was funny overall I found myself not amused. I have seen Louie in person a few years ago, and his material now has this older stuff beat."
4,Original insight on a key figure of France's Third Republic,"This book successfully deals with the primary school teacher, a living incarnation of the French republican ideals. This central figure in the history of France's Third Republic helps us understand such a crucial current as the pacifism that preceded World War I. >Francis Feeley, working on little known sources, brings to light many aspects often played down by French historians. Carefully following the lives and ideals of some leaders of the movement, this book brightly illustrates the importance of social and intellectual history both to historians and activists. > > Ronald Creagh, > Professor emeritus > Universite Paul Valery, Montpellier (France)"
5,Sitting at the Feet of a Sage,"During the course of my time reading this book, whether I was alone or sitting in a crowded coffee shop, something truly profound happened.I found myself reaching inwardly and outwardly, as if my soul was set aflame by this remarkable book. I read a LOT, yet Hixon brought Ramakrishna alive to me in a such a way that at times I felt a type of duel awareness- I was both reading the book and almost literally there with Ramakrishna. My senses were on overdrive almost throughout, and that does not happen with just any book.At one time Sri Ramakrishna will be sitting in deep meditation, then he'll be laughing and dancing, next he might be acting childishly, and then inevitably he will speak wisdom to the heart of each situation.This book is special. Let me just say that I don't currently have a copy because I've given away every copy I've ever owned. It's that kind of book."
4,wonderful overlooked classics,"There are so many beautiful melodies on this CD. Every peice is very listenable. Wolf-ferrari was not an innovator, but instead a master of creating beautiful music, and this CD has much of his best work. You will not be disappointed by this CD!"
5,VERYYYYYYY NICE,Very Nice and big i had a party on last week of april and was in it.............very nice......you can fit like 6 adults and 3 children...
3,Not very durable,"The kids had fun playing in the pool.Fairly easy to set up.Unfortunately the inflatable ring at the top is the only thing keeping the water in the pool.Our dog punctured the inflatable ring and we lost all the water.I would not recommend this pool,especially if you have dogs."
3,"Fabulous artwork, but awfully short.","I don't actually read spanish. I'll admit that. But... I bought this book to compare to the Viz release in the US. First item I've ever bought from an Argentinian company.The book is well produced, a slightly larger version of what Viz provided to the US audience. However, the key problem with buying this book is that it is only half of tankoubon 1. It collected the first 103 pages, merely chapters 1-3, of the manga, rather than chapters 1-7 like in the US copy.One of the perks, if you can call it that, of this version is that it has not been subjected to the censorship featured in the US version. You get the photoshopped Iori nude in all its nipply glory. But we don't buy manga for nipples, now do we? :DIt was fun reading this, my three years of high school Spanish doesn't seem to be totally blown yet, I guess. :D Then again, I had just finished the US version, and had followed the manga in the scanlation."
4,Essential reading for the Southern Wytch,"This book is a MUST HAVE for any Wiccan or Wytch in Australia - it is Australia's equivalent to Margot Alder's ""Drawing Down the Moon"" - and even New Zealand Wiccans and Wytches may find it of interest.While written in 1997, the Neo-Pagan seen has changed a bit since this book was written - or has it really? While the networking systems may have improved and certainly there is more (much much more) information available, a large percentage of what is covered in this book is still relevant today."
4,Too many conjectures,"Conversos in general, and converso women in particular, have been written out of history. This book does a great deal to show their importance both in Jewish history, and in the history of Western Civilization.I have two problems with the book. The first is the overuse of speculation. ""Dona Gracia may have... Dona Gracia probably... Dona Gracia likely""...In my view, it would have been better to stick to the known facts, and omit this embroidery.My second problem is the overuse of detail. Commercial transactions are describedin unnecessarily minute detail.In my opinion, a shorter, more focused book would have done greater justice to the author's subject and research."
2,Good idea; poor execution,"At first blush, I was intrigued by the situation this book presented. I was looking forward to a really good read, but unfortunately I was disappointed by the way Scott handled her plot. The action plodded when I wanted it to move quickly, and then sped through a lot that I thought needed more attention. The last fifth of the book, in my eyes, deserved four-fifths of the page count, and vice versa.To balance all that, I did enjoy the descriptions of the technology for the most part, and the environment in particular. The overall plot was good, even allowing for the odd expansion/compression mentioned above. As a whole, however, it just wasn't enough to draw me all the way in."
1,DANGEROUS PRODUCT!!,"Our 4-month old guinea pig also got her head stuck in between the wires. Somehow she was able to lift it off the side of the cage and was frantically running around, screeching, bumping into things with it stuck around her neck, her head was turned sideways. It was VERY frightening!! Not a safe product, not to mention that it creates more of a mess of hay all over and outside the cage and does not hold the product well. This product should be recalled for safety issues."
2,Bad for baby or young guinea pigs,"these would be great for a rabbit but my guinea pig climbed in it and got her head stuck because there is no topto it. there are other hay racks available with a top that would keep them out.I love them for rabbits, but they are much bigger.I would not buy this type for a guinea pig again. I love super pet but this should be for a rabbit only."
4,"Does what it needs to, little overpriced.","I would have bought this in my local pet store, they had it every time except for the time I went to buy it and it was $3 cheaper there.Otherwise it does what I need it to. It holds hay that comes in premade sections so I can break it off and give it to my bunny.The only thing that could be improved was if there was something other than just the 2 hooks at the top. My bunny tends to pull it off the hooks."
2,solar exhaust fan,"nice item,realy works. maybe a bit weak for an exhaust vanbut has worked continually for over a month."
2,Worthless,This vent doesn't move much air. You can barely tell it moves any air. Not worth the price...Don't waste your money...Ricko
4,A pioneer of lo-fi rockabilly continues his solo trek,"Though Romweber's been recording a similar mix of psychobilly and blues since his days in the Flat Duo Jets, his latest solo release distills the formula to its essence. Playing with a trio, and with Southern Culture on the Skids Rick Miller producing, Romweber sounds like a rockabilly version of Screamin' Jay Hawkins. His rhythm section (Sam Laresh on drums and Andrew Maltbie on bass) provide a rambunctious backing for the raucous guitar and growly, Tom Waitsian vocals. Originals like the jump-blues rockabilly ""Rockin' Dead man"" and the go-go instrumental ""Nabonga"" sit well with covers of obscurities like Benny Joy's ""Come Back"" and the Charlie Rich ballad ""I've Lost My Heart to You."" Add surf-tinged instrumentals like ""Nephretite"" and ""Nabonga"" and you have one fine rock 'n' roll LP."
4,Great fun,"This is a great album, I got it from my kids for Fathers day. Best thing is, it makes me want to pick up my guitar and play along."
5,amazing gift!!!,"we bought two of theses and they are amazing. wonderful for grandparents, especially those not so tacky ones that despise the ""world's greatest grandpa mug"" but still want to show off the kiddies. the shipping was really slow and they were late, not sure if that's related to the engraving or what so allow some time. great stuff."
1,Failed in 6 months,"Prior to writing this review, I used the HydroSet hygrogmeter to determine its accuracy and reliability. Conclusion? Piece of junk! My humi holds 100 sticks on two levels. Front mounted facing outwards on the lower portion is an analog meter. The HydroSet meter sat inside the humi on the upper shelf so I could judge the overall humidity between the lower and upper halves. Both meters were calibrated at the same time in the same zip lock bag. Five months pass and I notice the HydroSet staying at 70/70 while the analog fluctuated between 67/73. I took the HydroSet out, turned the knob, nothing happened, the readings remained the same. I tried a reset, nothing happened. I pulled the battery, let it sit for 30 minutes [in direct sun], put it back in and the sucker read 70/70. Talk about a false positive reading. I won't trust my sticks to something made this cheaply, never again!"
2,Is not calibrated.,Used the humidipak to help calibrate and it has yet to calibrate correctly stays above 78%humidity used my friends xikar to test if it was my humidor but it was not the device seems to be a bad. Bought a xikar one instead. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"The device is so inaccurate at times, I feel like I have a real weatherman on my side. I don't recommend it for professional use."
5,Good results,I purchased two of these hygrometers. They both worked correctly out of the box and consistently read within 1 degree and 1% of each other. Currently they are being used to monitor the humidity inside my house during the winter so we know how to adjust the humidifiers. The magnetic back is a nice feature.
4,Seems to work pretty good,"I bought this for a hydroponics and aeroponics unit I set up to record the air humidity and temperature. It seems to work fine and is in line with my other digital temp/humidity reader. I calibrated it at first by adding 1/4 cup of distilled water and 1/2 cup fo table salt together on a bowl and then putting the hygrometer in with it in a zip lock bag for about 14 hours until it read 75/75 (eHow instructions from Keith Dooley titled, ""How to Calibrate a Digital Humidor Meter""). The only complaint is that when it was sitting upside down (the little button at top on the bottom) the reading changed and I had to calibrate it all over again."
3,Annoying to calibrate,"This thing works OK once you get it calibrated, but that is a painful process. I splurged and spent the extra $4 on the calibration bag. The meter took a good 12 hours to settle in the bag which is what the directions said. However, adjusting the dial to mach the 75% humidity of the bag was a huge pain. You basically have to adjust it in the bag to get it right. After 3 days and numerous adjustments I think I finally got it right. Regardless, I'm going to buy one or two more since aditional ones should be a breeze to calibrate by simply putting them next to the one I already calibrated."
5,"Calibrated perfectly, right out of the box...","I purchased this and the Boveda calibration kit. After letting the hygrometer sit in the kits air-tight bag with the humidipak for a day and a half, I found it to be perfectly calibrated. No complaints and will probably buy a second for my smaller humidor.FYI - You can reuse the Boveda calibration kit for up to 6 months after you open it according to the instructions. I didn't know that at first and thought it was worth sharing."
1,Unhelpful and untrustworthy company,I actually bought two humidor and 1 hydrometer from these folks so I spent a bit of money. The least they could have done was answer my emails regarding my defective hydrometer. I had to calibrate it ten times and it never remained consistent. Emailed quality importers about the inconsistency and never heard a response back.
2,2 Stars for shipping only!,"I wanted a back-up device for the installed dial unit on my glass-top humidor. By doing the salt test I knew that it was correct. Upon receiving this digital unit I used the same salt test. It registered 17& higher then it should but turning adjustment dial does nothing. Not even the reset button works. Oh, Amazon Prime had it delivered in under two days!! 2 Stars!!"
4,Works as advertised,"Simple and straightforward. I set this in my cal pack for 2 days and found it was reading 6% high. Recalibrated the hygrometer, waited 2 more days and it was spot on. Read the cal instruction before making the adjustments. This is a great replacement for the crappy hygrometer that comes with a humidor, I highly recommend it."
1,Really disappointed,"The first box I received was empty -- just the instructions. Amazon quickly sent another. This time I got what I paid for, but it's barely functional. The digits are often replaced with dashes, giving me no readout. When it does report temperature and humidity, it will sometimes jump erratically. Just now it went from ""75F 32%"" to ""150F 18%"". Sometimes it's more subtle, jumping from say ""68F 35%"" instantly to ""74F 26%"". I can't depend on it to show me anything, and when it does show something I can't trust it.Given how cheap the unit seems, I have no confidence a replacement will be any better or will last if it's initially ok. I'm returning it for something else."
5,Useful for monitoring guitar case humidity,I purchased this (plus the calibration kit) due to suspicions of the accuracy of an analog hygrometer that came in an acoustic guitar case I recently purchased. After calibration (it was only off 2.5%) I've now determined the analog hygrometer is off by 40%! This gadget probably saved me from some guitar damage had I trusted the cheap analog hygrometer and unnecessarily increased the guitar case humidity.
2,Definitely does NOT work right out of the box,"Unfortunately, this hygrometer requires on site calibration to work properly. I put it into a water saturated environment and it read 80% humidity. Coming back to this site, I realize I should have bought the calibration kit that the manufacturer offers. The shipping charge makes the whole endeavor a wash. I'll probably throw the thing away. Bottom line, if you buy this product, get the calibration kit at the same time. Hopefully that will make it worthwhile."
3,Half great...,"Tested this until against several others, and the hygrometer worked perfectly - didn't need any calibrating right out of the box. But the temperature reading is off by 3 degrees! If I'm wrong, someone please correct me, but I can't see a way to calibrate the thermometer part of this unit. I'd give it five stars if the temperature could be reset."
4,Hygrometer Review,I bought this hygrometer to work in conjunction with a new dehumidifier I bought for my basement. I use it to monitor the level of humidity in my basement. I have computer equipment and a lot of musical instruments there. It seems to be working beautifully. I keep the basement at a steady 40% humidity and monitor the air temperature with this as well. So far I'm satisfied with the item and would recommend it to anyone.
5,A GREAT improvement from the analog gauges,"I bought 2 of these with the calibration kit to replace the analog gauges in my humidors. I am assuming they are accurate as they both read the same temp and are within 1 % RH. These are nice because they fit directly in replacement of the spot made for the innacurate analog gauges. If you have a humidor without one of these, buy one. You won't regret it."
2,Get something else.,"I purchased this under the mistaken assumptions that it would be larger than it is, and that it would be ready to use. This unit is actually little bigger than a silver dollar, making the temp and humidity numbers difficult to read. Also, the unit HAS to be calibrated in order to work properly, something not mentioned in the product description. So, I had to order the calibration kit for $5.15 and it cost me an additional ten bucks to ship it, too. My gripe is, if a calibration kit is needed, sell it with the product!Lastly, it affixes to its mounting base via magnetism. Three days after I had installed it, I heard something fall. I didn't find anything, until a day later when I opened the refridgerator where it had been installed, and the hygrometer was lying on the bottom, having lost its magnetism. I wonder what's next."
1,Cannot calibrate,"I bought two of these things a few days ago. I was immediately stunned by the fact that the instructions require a third-party calibration set in order to calibrate these hygrometers (by the way, you should always calibrate a hygrometer upon purchase). Oh well, fortunately I still had the instructions for my other Xikar hygrometer which described a simple salt calibration method. Did that. One hygrometer read 10% too low and the other 5% too low. So I proceeded to the adjustment phase as described by the instruction sheet that came with the product. That is, turning the knob clockwise should have adjusted the hygrometers to read the correct values, one click at the time. Problem is, turning the knob did absolutely nothing, on both hygrometers. I read the instructions over and over, tried many times, without luck. I came to the only conclusion that the adjustments knobs simply do not work. These hygrometers are completely useless."
1,Do not buy,"I needed a new hygrometer for my humidor. I ordered this one because it was a great price. I was never able to properly calibrate it as the adjustment knob never worked. I decided not to calibrate it and stuck it straight in my humidor. After it was in there for about 20 mins, it read 99% humidity and then shut off and never turned back on. Do not buy. Spend the extra money and get a better product."
2,mine was defective,I bought this product and the optional calibration kit that came with it. Following the instructions it turned out that it was impossible to get it properly calibrated (turning it all the way up still left it reading 4% lower than it was supposed to read). Unfortunately I was traveling and failed to report its failure in the first 30 days so I guess I'm stuck with a worthless Hygrometer (or perhaps I can just add 4 and assume it is right then - two stars instead of one because my hunch is that adding 4 will get it in the ballpark so it is close enough).
3,Mine Won't Calibrate,"After sitting in the Calibration Kit bag for a day, the humidity reading was only off by +1%. That's close enough for my purposes which is a good thing because the calibration adjustment on the one I received flat out does not work. I rotated the calibration knob through its entire range of motion clockwise and counterclockwise and the reading never changed.Also, trying to turn that tiny calibration knob while it's inside the Calibration Kit bag is almost impossible. Amazon also carries a very similar item for $3 more that is calibrated to 75% humidity inside the bag by just pushing a Calibrate button. In hindsight this would have been a better solution.Therefore, even though this is accurate enough for my purposes and works well, I have marked it down for the calibration feature not working."
3,Difficult to calibrate,"Out of the box it was apx. 8 degrees off and I used the salt test to calibrate. I would be able to get it close to 75 degrees, but when I adjusted it one ""notch"" it jumped 10 degrees. Seems that the notches to do not correspond to a 1 degree of change and makes proper calibration nearly impossible. It does seem to be accurate, but the repeated attempts and time spent calibrating the unit makes it not worth it."
2,HygroSet II - plan on spending more money and time,"This thing was off by 20% when I got it. Had trouble calibrating because the ""clicks on the dial are not consistent. After about a week of messing with it and purchasing a calibration kit I finally got it to work. If you buy this plan on spending more money on a calibration kit that should be included with it and taking time to get it set up like it should have been when you get it."
2,Buy with caution,"I purchased one and it worked great. Came up to nearly 75% using boveda calibration kit. Adjusted easily. That being said, at my suggestion, a friend of mine bought two from this vendor (which I calibrated for him using my kit) but both could not be adjusted. The adjustment dial was broken. Two out of three with problems? I question whether or not the one I have that ""works"" is accurate given the obvious quality control issues."
4,Effective to put in one place and leave,"Being used to cooking thermometers with their instant reads, I was a little surprised at how long it takes for this device to adjust itself - around 15 minutes. No big deal once you know it - you just set it down and leave it for awhile. Also for my purpose, I was hoping for an ""off"" switch, which it does not have.With the double-sided tape on the back of the unit, it is obviously intended to be put in one place and left. For that purpose it is accurate and effective."
4,Great starter piece,Really easy to use for a newbie like me. Works great. Keeps my precious cigars as fresh as can be.
5,awesome,"had this for a good while now & it works perfect. I bought the separate bag to calibrate it. Still on the original batteries. Small form, love it. If it breaks for some reason, I will buy the exact same one again."
2,not very accurate,I bought this for my husband along with the calibration kit. He had to buy a new one within 2 weeks because the hygrometer was very inaccurate. I recommend browsing others if you want your cigars to be perfectly maintained.
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought a humidor about two weeks ago and purchased this Hygrometer to monitor the levels. I assumed it would be a premium digital meter but I was mistaken. I opened the humidor for the first time in 3 days. The SOB is dead as a door nail. My levels were at 68% humidity a few days ago. I'll try and replace the battery then, if that doesn't work I'll smash it with a hammer and reflect on the $20 threw away. Don't buy this junk."
1,Does not calilbrate,"After multiple attempts, could never get it calibrated. The adjustment dial appears to do nothing. I would not recommend this product if you want accuracy and plan to try and calibrate it."
2,Not a high quality product.,"I used this hygrometer in a terrarium that is designed to grow mushrooms, which require a 75-95 percent humidity level. After calibrating the hygrometer worked for about a day then whenever the humidity level went above 89% the numbers were replaced by two dashes i.e. 75F 89% then 75F --%. Sometimes the unit would stop displaying entirely and I would have to remove the battery and put it back in. I am disappointed with the performance of this product although it did include a magnetic plate that glues to the inside of your terrarium/humidor which I found to be very convenient. If the unit would have just performed as it was supposed to I would have been satisfied."
3,Meh,"Seems to work OK on how quickly it can takea reading, and how quickly it will change, but it doesn't adjust like it is supposed to do."
3,A non-accurate gadget!,"Nice little gadget, but:1. Temperature accuracy: +2degF2. I did the salt thing, read 72%RH - I can live with that :-)I learn to subtruct 2 from the temps and add 3 to the RH.Would I recommend the thing...maybe not!Even if the price is almost OK!"
4,Accurate within 2% out of the box. Adjustment knob it difficult to use.,"Was accurate within 2% out of the box. I recommend using theBoveda One-Step Calibration Kitfor a perfect calibration. 4-star rating because it was slightly off and the adjustment knob it difficult to use (it took me several attempts to achieve a perfect setting, which required repeated testing over a period of a few days)."
1,Works right out of the Box?,"This item did not work at all. Upon firing it up the instrument gave error messages and some erroneous readings (-34 degrees when it was 90 out). I removed the battery and placed it back in the device to see if that would make a difference. I have had it the the Hygrometer Calibration Kit for a couple of days now, but still no luck."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"I bought this to replace the plastic analog one that came with my humidor.I got it along with the hygro calibration kit and it set it to the right temp and humidity level.But when I put it in my humidor,the humidor wasn't at the reccomended settings.So,I went to manually calibrate it after I got my humidor right,I could not move the buttons or reset it.I tried and tried and would not do anything.So,I guess I got a bad one or something.Still using my cheap analog one,until my new digital one come's in.GOOD LUCK!!!!"
2,Cheap and Shoddy,"The battery compartment isn't manufactured to hold the battery in contact with the leads properly so the units flake out a lot. You can fix this yourself by putting in a piece of paper or something to push the battery against the contacts, but even when you do this you may have a hygrometer that doesn't work so well. I find that the calibration knob doesn't really function well. With quality this low, what's the point?"
5,Great hygrometer,Very accurate and you can calibrate it so you always know your smokes are being stored right.
2,Does not work as advertised,"The instructions recommend using a ""One-step Calibration Kit by Humidipak"" to callibrate the Hygrometer. That should be stated up front. I have it in my humidor but have never been able to reliably calibrate it."
3,Not a Weight Watchers 1-2-3 book!,"I pre-ordered this book well before it was published thinking that the ""1-2-3"" reference in the title meant it was related to Weight Watcher's ""1-2-3"" Success program. I was chagrined to learn upon its receipt that the book wasn't what I expected. The book does, however, contain some interesting recipes and some might rank high as part of a weight management menu."
2,Good if you can obtain the exotic ingredients,"This book would be good if I had a bigger food budget as many of the recipes call for more exotic foods and spices than I generally keep in my kitchen, or can afford to buy. Lots of good pictures to drool over though."
1,Ethically untenable.,"Pernkopf's anatomy textbook has been praised for its quality. I wouldn't know - I've never looked at it. And I never will, because Pernkopf participated in unethical experiments on living human beings while gathering information for this atlas. His unwilling subjects, mostly Jews incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps, underwent experimental surgeries and dissections, some having spinal or peripheral nerves severed. They were then awakened and made to report on the effect of the lesions. As a physician, scientist, and human being, I find these experiments and Pernkopf's work entirely unacceptable on ethical grounds. I will not be a participant, not even to the extent of reviewing the results, some of which appear in this volume. If you have an interest in human anatomy, do yourself a favor - buy Frank Netter's atlas. It's the finest available, and was based on cadaveric dissections; his models willed their bodies to science."
3,The Point & Figure Method of Anticipating Stock Prices,"Is a good primer for the novice technician to decide whether or not persue further study of Point and Figure Charts. The book can be read in an hour or so, however, I found his writing style somewhat tedious but clear. Another draw back is that the print is small and poor quality in places, probably because it's a reproduction of the original. Since the book was written there have been a few improvements to the construction, recognition of more patterns, and optimization of P&F charts. None of these improvements are earth-shaking as they are only refinements that have evolved in the changing markets.For advanced study, John J. Murphy's comprehensive book, ""Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets,"" goes well into detail of the construction of P&F charts, many pattern examples, and suggestions how to optimize them. Although Murphy wrote the book around the futures markets, it applies to stock equites, mutual funds, options, and indices as well."
3,read next,"An interesting historical reference. You can see how far the methodhas come since 1933. But if you want to learn and use P&Fcharting, buy the Tom Dorsey book, ""Point and Figure Charting: The Essential Application for Forecasting and Tracking Market Prices."" excellent for timing your entry, setting stops and forming an exit strategy as well to control risk. END"
1,Go figure.,"If you are looking for a book that will explain point and figure charting, keep searching. This book is sketchier on the actual construction of p&f charts than a full service broker."
3,*Shrugs*,"Since You Went Away is the epitome of a family war film. It is so standard, that one will be able to guess what happens next throughout the film. Although it is certainly filled with heartwarming moments, most of them seem artificial and therefore less emotional.The film has an amazing cast, headed by the beautiful Claudette Colbert. She is perhaps the best in the film but also very standard. She makes her character believable, but unfortunately is boring.The lighting is really great; the cameraman and the director seemed to have a great grasp on the use of light and shadow. However, beautiful photography does not save a film.It is obvious that Selznik's company meant for this to be an important film. There is an overture and an intermission just the way there is in Gone With the Wind, but the difference is that Gone With the Wind is an amazing film and this one comes off as being just okay."
2,"Gone With The Wind, NOT!!!!","Just saw complete movie 1st time. Great Max Steiner score! Some terrific BW cinematography shots (Airplane hanger/shadows dance, hallway /restaurant customers in shadow converstions & Jenifer Jones in shadow @ rail station)BUT overall movie doesn't hold up, disjointed script, too many characters, fake sentimentality, unconvincing portrayals IMO. Selznick trys for a WW II GWTW treatment that just DOESN'T work here. Movie can't hold a candle to Best Years Of Our Lives. Sorry!!!"
2,Too Dated for Today,"Okay, I love old B&W movies but this can't hold a candle to ""Mrs. Miniver"" (now there was a woman who knew how to cope) and ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" I found Colbert's character so annoying..her big hardship was that she couldn't afford her maid and she didn't know how to manage money, because obviously Hubby did all that before he was shipped out and I guess she just sat around in her designer clothes and looked pretty. Also, I know that times were different when this was made but the portrayal of the black maid and the making fun of ""Japs"" really made me very uncomfortable. Sorry, I'll watch the other two movies any time, but not this one...once was plenty."
5,The War at Home,This is a great movie! Highly recommended. All three of the lead actresses are wonderful. A very moving story and a different look at the war for history buffs.
5,Oh For the Good Old Days,"This movie was my first introduction to what life at home was like for the families who sent husbands, fathers or sons off to World War II. Yes, it is a little schmaltzy and you can pretty much guess what's going to happen next; but with a cast that includes Claudette Colbert, Joseph Cotton, Shirley Temple (as a teen), and Robert Walker -- how could it go wrong? Anyone who lived through the Forties and World War II or who grew up during the Fifties should enjoy this capsule of life at home during the war."
5,The War at Home,"I love this movie probably because I lived it and yes, it is a Chick Flick, but a real golden oldie. Check it out just to see how David Selznick did after ""Gone with the Wind"". It's right on target for much of the picture and overly sentimental for the other portion, but it will warm your heart, I promise."
5,A wonderful film!,I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend it!I'd give it more stars if I could.
5,Since You Went Away,"This movie should be a staple to every movie buff! It is a movie I've watched over and over again throughout the years that I've had it, first my own recording, then VHS and now DVD."
3,Great Barrier Reef DVD,"I bought this DVD because of our love of sea life and vast experience diving and snorkeling. I was sure that since it had been an IMAX movie that it would be a superior view. I was wrong. This DVD was mediocre at best. There was not enough ocean life in this film, and the commentary was less than scintillating. Better off ordering the Dolphin's IMAX which lived up to its IMAX reputation."
4,Beautiful sceneries.,"Forget about all those special effects movies. If you really want to impress with your video-equipment, buy this DVD. You have to see it to believe it. I only had one gripe with this DVD, there is no option to turn off the commentary. I think it would be a great idea if they had an option to just listen to the music and watch the pictures. So I just turn off the sound, and put on a nice CD."
1,"Great showcase of poor diving, reef destruction by ""experts"", poor film work, and poor sound.","The absolute worst reef documentary I've ever seen. As short as it is, a lot of time is wasted on silly pretentious landside footage. The main feature of the program is poorly lit underwater footage showcasing Ron and Valerie destroying coral and harassing marine life while exhibiting sloppy, careless diving skills. The university of Minnesota should be embarrassed to put their name on this. Unbelievable! To top it off, we're expected to sit through not one, but TWO obligatory ""shark shock"" scenes. During the stupid ""shark shock,"" be sure to have the remote handy to turn the thundering noise down or brace yourself for a headache."
2,Not Widescreen,"I was very disappointed that the DVD is not widescreen although it claims to be. When I watch it on my widescreen TV I have two big bands on each side of the screen. However, the film and music are beautiful. I would give it five stars for the content. If you don't have a widescreen TV then I highly recommend it."
1,This is way too funny....,"I wish I was there when this was thought up.Idiot #1: ""I think DVDs and other 'techy' things are instruments of the Devil""Idiot #2: ""How do we get the word out?""Idiot #1: ""I know! Let's make a DVD!""Idiot #2: ""Great idea! And we can sell it on 'the internets'..."""
5,GREAT WORKOUT,"This works...Great for advanced/intermediate levels. Beginners as well, as long as they follow the modified movements. Excellent weight training for the thighs and upper body."
2,Disappointed,"I did not know in advance that there were so many different pieces of equipment required for this DVD (body bar, step, etc) and so I didn't get any benefits from doing the workout. I will do more thorough research in the future."
4,"Good workout, but a little tricky for the uncoordinated","This is a really good workout after the first four or five times, once you get the steps. For the sculpting stick I used a shower curtain rod that I had in the garage and it worked great. I also purchased a Rubbermaid stepstool at WalMart and put it on top of an old STEPII that I've had for years, total height 13 ins. (close enough!). (WalMart also has another gray Rubbermaid stepstool that works well for only $6.) Both worked great, although the shower curtain rod is a little light - just sub some weights - but it works great for stability. You feel like you've had a great workout when through. I highly recommend."
3,Not My Favorite Firm Workout,"I am new to the firm workout series. I am a runner/martial artist so I usually do these two activities for exercise. However I have been looking for videos that have some strength training aspects to them to round out my total fitness. My favorite firm videos so far are Super Body Sculpt and Supercharged Sculpting. This video was too much aerobic not enough weights. If you like the combo of the two activities then it is a decent choice. The ab section was good and the instructor didn't annoy me. However, I thought the use of the sculpting stick was pointless."
5,Awesome workout!!!!,"I recently purchased the DVD set-this being one of the DVD's. I was kind of nervous because I usually do Karen Voight-but this is a really challenging workout. Good mix of cardio and weights-the squats are killer, so I know my legs will be toned and fabulous. I just started the series, but I know that I will see results soon. As for the Fanny Firmer, you really do need it-a regular step didn't seem to work for me. Can't wait to do the rest of the series."
3,Annoying instructor,"I've been doing the Firm since they came out in the 80s. I am 49. I've had this video (VHS) for many years. The workout itself is quite comprehensive and is an hour long. It's a good workout. However, I cannot stand Emily's hyperactive manner and annoying squeeky voice!! For that reason, I rarely do this workout. I prefer calm and poised instructors (Tracie Long, Pam Cauthen, for example)."
4,Fun Total Body Aerobic Weight Training Workout,"I would rate this workout as a solid intermediate to low advanced. I would rate a Cathe Friedrich strength workout as an Advanced. This is a very fun with no dread factor true AWT workout. Emily is very personable and cues quite well. The pace of the workout allows for the exerciser to up the weights. The reason I find this workout so fun and effective is because it includes a little of everything and at the end I feel as though I've had a good total body workout. This workout includes some step routines, hi-lo, strength and floorwork. The variety is very motivating to reach for this time and again. The music is good. While the set is not as elaborate as The Firm Classics it doesn't take away from the workout. Everyone looks as if they are enjoying working out and this adds to motivate you to do the same. Of this series the other workout I also enjoy is Allie's Maximum Cardio Burn. Both of these are a favorite of mine."
1,very disappointed-Not for beginners,"I just started this tape and it ticked me off in the first minute. This tape is not for beginners. It says to follow a certain person if you are new,,,,then they put that person in the back behind others and never put the camera on her, duh!! There's no warm up, the moves are complicated (especially for a beginner), it's a sports injury looking for a place to happen. The moves are complicated. The instructor does not build on each move, she goes straight for the complicated one and only does 4 reps of it before zooming on to the next move. I felt lost and only able to figure out 1 rep of each move before she went to the next one. She seems like she's spent way to much time at Starbucks. Don't waste your $ unless you enjoy watching the same tape over & over & over to figure it out. Also, you need hand weights, their $60 fanny lifter, and their sculpting stick....there's way better for alot cheaper out there. Keep looking."
2,Un-met expectations,"I was very disapointed with this video. If you are not a pro dancer these steps tend to go way to fast. By the time I got the steps, she had moved on to the next move. She talked a lot without explaining much. The sculpting stick was hardly used to make the purchase worthwhile. A broom handle would work just as well given her lack of use. Overall I have used much more effective video workouts. Don't waste your money."
2,Too much for me,I had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer. The combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining.Many people love this video but I just had a bad experience with it.
3,"Good Workout, but not exciting","This is undoubtedly a great overall workout. However, I don't find myself wanting to do it as often as some of my other DVDs and videos because the instructors and the overall tone of it seems stiff/fake to me. I'd say that's true about the whole ""The Firm"" series though. So if you like the rest of the series, you'll probalby be fine with this too. They just don't get me motivated to work out."
1,Slow Workout,"If you are in relatively good or even average shape and are looking to really tone up and sculpt your body, this isn't the workout for you. It didn't get my heart rate up and I didn't break a sweat. The instructor spent too much time in between exercises to explain what was next, too much down time. I actually got bored.The sculpting stick was not needed, and the 'fanny lifer' was used to just sit on much of the time when the exercises could have been modified standing or kneeling.I am extremely disappointed. I wasn't sore or challenged. This might be a good workout for someone who is extremely overweight and needs to go at a slower pace, but anyone looking to drop 5-20 lbs or firm up this isn't for you!"
3,They look strong and fit,"No I will not spend 60 dollars your fanny lifter and your sculpting stick just so I can do everything in this video. Some of it looks fun but I don't really want to watch an hour long commercial for blonde's crotches, new balance and the fanny lifter."
4,a good book. bought my third copy,"I just bought another copy of this book, this for my son's birthcay. My wife and I finally got to use ours last summer and found it very useful. Had no problems following it over about a week, and used the maps it recommended. I recommend it, and in fact this is the third I've bought. We have others in the series, and liked them also."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this video because I like the Prevention 3-2-1 video, and because I like Chris Freytag, however overall I was pretty disappointed. Each section consists of 8 or 9 minutes of abdominal exercises, but the moves are modified to suit the earliest beginners and do not consist of enough reps to fatigue the muscles (or even make you feel like you've been working out). I don't consider myself to be in great shape, but I did the entire video from beginning to end and didn't break a sweat or feel like I'd accomplished much. I gave the video three stars because I did like the variety of moves and angles that were worked and because I think for a beginner this might be a good abs workout. For intermediate exercisers I would recommend Tamilee Web's ""I want that Body"" video or one of the other Gaiam Pilates videos, which provide better overall abdominal work."
4,Bjorling,"According to the poet Edward Mayes, Jussi has ""lungs like God."" Mayes is right. Even in the live arena, Bjorling succeeds in rousing us from mediocrity. He propels us into the sublime of lyricism and melody. And I don't even understand much of his language!"
4,It's OKAY but a TAD BIT TOO SHORT - 4.5 Stars - But Read Review,"They should in the specs provide the length; it would be handy it various length sizes were so available but alas - this one was a close shave, had to slightly work with it because it was just a tad-bit too short in length.Honestly now, do they sincerely believe that our OS systems are all equal? Overall; not all OS Towers are created equal either for that matter need I not to go any further? Some may only have 4 bays, some 8 with 4 hidden to as many as 40 bays or more - if they built it.That is my humble opinion. If Sata Cables come in various lengths why not jumpers/splitters too?"
5,Good,"I bought this little item just for extension more power connectors to my sata parts. I can't understand why the power supply factory cannot make more connectors. This splitter works and cheap. Thanks to it, my additional SSD can work very well."
5,Execellent product - just be aware of the shipping time,"This particular product lets you power two Sata drives from a single Molex (power for IDE drives) connector. The drives have to be fairly close together as the cables are only a few inches long. (Within 1 or 2 bays of each other). Just be aware of the shipping time - Mine shipped from China, which took 3-4 weeks, and I was not able to track its progress during this time - a little frustrating. The shipping time was actually displayed at order time, and it is a good thing I had ordered this for a hobby project and not for a deadline."
3,Get it!,"I have a ton of belly dance dvd's, and was very excited about a new BDSS release. Some of the performances were dissipointing, but I like it for the most part.I love Moria and Sharon's performances! Probably my favorites. I expected more from Mardi and Kami. I prefer Zoe live, but she was real cute. Also, no troupe performances, all solos! Every one looks and dresses the same, a little variety would have been nice. Also, there is a lack of passion and energy, maybe because it wasn't performed live. It was obvious they recorded the performances over and over till they got the perfect video.It's more than worth the price. Rachel is always wonderful, and well as Urban Tribal. It's always great to see new faces. I say get it!"
3,Some of it YES and some of it ..umm no.,"My two favorite dancers in the ATS bunch are Mardi Love and Moria Chappell. Not to take away from the others dancers' beauty and talent but I like to see the old ancient dances mixed in a little bit too and thats what Mardi and Moria do, they're graceful and very beautiful to watch. The others were great also but I found myself skipping through them too often. However I liked Rachel's fast paced moves, she busted out with, def, a change from the slow moves I usually see her do. I guess for those whom like a mixture of old ancient dance and some breakdance and some industrial goth moves, this might be for you...."
3,Bad image!,"I agree with the other customers. I love bellydance superstars, but this dvd isn't what I expected! In particular I wonder how they could release a dvd with such a bad quality! It looks like watching the dancers through the fog!"
5,First Days Night,I read this book in 2 days. I couldn't put it down! Clues begin to unravel about the past and I was drawn in. As more and more clues unraveled I just wanted to keep reading to find out what really happened on the reservation so many years ago. I enjoyed Glimmer by the same author but this one is even better!
3,"Not That Good, Not That Bad","This episode is neither as bad nor as good as other reviewers hype it up to be. It's a decent middle-of-the-road OL. Highly padded (by virtue of the overlong teaser, which is repeated verbatim in the episode), suffering from really cheap effects, but a decent enough story competently enough presented.It's the Andromeda Strain, with space barnacles in place of a killer virus. The barnacles grow anywhere, reproduce like kudzu, and exhale a highly toxic gas in the process. The astronauts who discover them don't realize until too late that they are bringing a deadly organism back with them, and the government has one helluva problem on its hands.The performances are good, and so is the suspense. The effects are pretty cheesy. The production team was badly strapped when this one was shot, but they did a creditable job of making-do in spite of it.Not a front-runner episode in anyone's book, but enjoyable enough if you like this kind of thing."
4,One of the better episodes in an overrated series,"Similarities to Day of the triffid aside, the inventiveness of a ""bad guy"" taking the form of a flowering bulb from outer space hooked me when I first saw this as a kid.Looking back at it nearly half a century after it was produced, one can take amusement at the sheer recklessness in absence of quarantine measures while taking these things on board a space station and then transporting them back to earth. But as a cautionary tale of invasive species and ecological mayhem, it was ahead of its time and may even have contributed to adoption of quarantine procedures in exploration and research.While others have commented on cheesy production values, The Outer Limits ALWAYS worked on a shoestring budget. This episode was above par, topped off with decent direction and a truly disturbing musical score."
1,Too much like DAY of the TRIFFIDS,"The plot and the ending bear too much similarity to Day of the Triffids. If you have seen that movie, you will not need to see this video. The decision to allow the spaceship, with its deadly infectious cargo, to land on Earth is a stupid decision - which would not occur in a real situation."
3,Not a book for beginning ID,If you have a background in forestry and already know your trees then this book is fine for such things as additional research. If you are looking for a book to help you with tree identification in the field look elsewhere. There are very few pictures to help the beginner and flipping through to read the descriptions to figure it out gets annoying.
5,sta-bil stabilizer,"Just what I ordered! I need it for my snow blower , lawn mower and other related equipment. I have used it for years."
4,Always use it,Have always used Sta-Bil to keep my gasoline fresh and last through the inactive winter months. So far I have had pretty good luck with it and engines fire up in the Spring.
2,Sta-Bil,"I used this product in my Waverunner, Snowmobile and Boat.Put it in every tank every time I needed to add gas.All engines were made by Yamaha, I need to do over all my Carburetorswhich was very costly. This product seemed to break down and gunk up the carburetor.Not happy with the perfomance. My son who does nothing in his Ski-Doo has neverhad a problem, just empties the gas at the end of the season.I have switched to another product."
4,The most recommended fuel stabilizer for storage,"I think we've all heard it - if you're going to leave your car, jetski, motorcycle, or whatever type of motorized vehicle sitting for longer than a month, it's recommended to use fuel stabilizer. Sta-bil is the most widely available and recommended brand. It's easy, you just dump some in the tank before filling up, and your fuel is good to go for a couple months longer than it would have been."
5,Must Have,"I have used this product for years to keep my gas fresh. I add it to my generator, lawn mower and boat tanks. Great for gas storage and is reasonably priced, it does as advertised."
4,Product and service review.,Been using Sta-Bil for years. Running all my gas powered equipment dry at seasons end is a big chore. Sta-Bil does the trick.
2,coincidence in car troules???,"did this cause the problem? coincidence in two vehicles having he same trouble after using this product??? i put some in the tank of my 2004 kawasaki enduro and shortly thereafter it runs like it is missing, that there is a fuel starvation problem. i added it also to my 1992 astro van and shortly thereafter the same problem, it will run as if missing, as if fuel starved. same feeling when there is a clogged fuel filter. not sure this product caused it, but one vehicle, then the other??? i will not risk it again."
2,Buy more it cost more,Curious why the single 32oz. bottle is the best buy. The 32oz. bottle cost .424 cents per oz. The gallon cost is .511 cents per oz. You'd think if you bought more it would get cheaper but it doesn't. Goes against everything I hold dear.
3,how can i tell,I bought it because it was cheap. How can one tell if the product is good Stabilizer is stabilizer. Go for the price.
2,"for MILD ""depression"" only","While there are some useful cognitive therapies in this book, it's really aimed at people with mild depression -- which wasn't made clear until about a third of the way through the book, which was frustrating to me (I was reading and thinking, ""I do not see [beloved of mine who struggles with severe depression] in here at all""). While the author talks about depression as distinct from, for example, healthy grief, and takes seriously the utility of, for example, antidepressant medications, the book generally seems to me to skew too far toward thinking yourself out of depression and isn't attentive enough to the reality of e.g. neurochemical factors beyond the sufferer's control."
4,Not another battles of the Civil War book,"More than just a military book about the American Civil War, this book shows how the war impacted the regular population, economy and countryside. McPherson is one of the best ACW authors along with Buell and Foote."
1,Advertisement is false,"I saw the picture for the 1997 version (green and black)as I needed it for school, so naturally I ordered it. To my severe dissappointment I received the 1996 version with a burgundy and blue cover. This is frustrating when you think your getting something your not."
5,The Black Donnellys - The Complete Series,Best show ever made. Even better to be able to watch the episodes again and catch things I missed before. SECOND SEASON PLEASE!!!!!
5,Wonderful!,The entire First Season very well done on DVD.Now if we could just get them to make the 2nd season!BRING BACK THE BLACK DONNELLYS!
5,Awesome show!,"Buy this dvd, show your support for this awesome show. My whole family wants it back on TV. We love it!"
5,The most amazing show ever!!,The Black Donnellys is in my opinion the most amazing show on television. I say is because it's still on television on HDNet. Please check it out if you have that channel. You won't be disappointed. The cast is full of amazing actors and the crew are some of the best in the business. Buy the DVD collection when it comes out. You'll want it in your collection so you can watch it over and over whenever you want. And I guarantee that you'll want to.
5,the black donnellys,"the black donnellys will gratify the most finicky fan. . . a soprano fan! it has everything great, (writing, directing, acting, music etc.) this show takes you on a journey well worth the trip.ENJOY!"
3,The Black Donnellys,"The Black Donnellys is 13 enjoyable episodes of Irish-American criminals. It suggests a more violent Brotherhood. The use of the unreliable narrator is an excellent technique. It is unfortunate this is the complete series since clearly, the way it ends indicates the show was destined for at least a second series. Nevertheless what is there is there to be enjoyed."
5,amazing,"this show only has 13 episodes, 6 of which actually aired. From the pilot on, every minute is brilliantly written and downright unmissable. I love it, and i'm about to buy another copy for my best friend for christmas."
5,NBC is crazy!!!,"I cannot believe this show got cancelled. I cannot believe that people would rather tune in to American Idol or Dancing with the Stars than to watch a show with an amazing script, great story and awesome acting. I watched the whole season even when it was yanked off NBC and it made me sick to think that people didn't catch on. I don't think that shows like this or Friday Night Lights got as much advertising as they should have (although FNL survived, good for them). Anyway, everyone should really give this show a chance. Watch a couple of episodes and see if you don't get hooked! You'll probably end up watching the whole series which is only one season unfortunately..."
5,NBC SUCKS!,I dont' know about you but I love movies and tv shows that are about the mob. And this show was such a good take on it. It was a differnt take on the mob than every other show or movie put out there. I could never understand why they took this amazing show off the air! I bought all of the episodes off of itunes every week and it just got better every week. I was instantly hooked from the get go. If it wasn't for Law and Order SVU I would never turn on NBC. Heros is not enough life support to keep that network alive. If they kept this show on they might of had a fighting chance.
1,Don't be fooled,Being from London and having read all the books and written school projects i saw this sitting on the shelf and got excited... Got it home and found out it was only the name on the box that's original...
4,where are the extras,loved the show - sad it was canceled. would have given it 5 stars except there are no extras on the dvd - the websites had commentary and it would have been a excellent addtion for the shows fans.
5,Cancelled? Are you serious!!,"This was the most enjoyable new tv series i have watched in along time. I just wish we could bring it back somehow. The show has the ability to leave you wanting more which is exactly what it did for me. The end of the show left me with so many unanswered questions but i wont get into that i wouldnt want to ruin it, for someone that is interested in seeing the series. So if you want a good tv series to watch then buy this dvd you wont be disappointed."
4,Save TBD,"You'll never be so disappointed that a show is so good. It will leave you yelling at the tv and writing nasty notes to NBC requesting that they please, pretty please just put out one more season- we gotta know what happens!"
5,A tragedy,This was one of the few quality shows on cable. In fact it is the only one I thought worth watching in a long long time. I really enjoyed its unique story line and quality picture. It's very sad that it was cancelled so prematurely. Hopefully it can come back a little more hardcore on HBO or something.
5,Everyone should buy this!!!!,This is the best series ever! Once you watch the pilot you're hooked. Don't miss out!
5,reefs great ride,"Definitively the band's best album, Rides seems more the work of the reef that made replenish than that of glow. They still have catchy riffs and user friendly basslines, yet they seem to experiment more on a different sound. This album, the less commercial of the four, appears to be the most sentimental and intense, although it appears to have traded its accessibility for those qualities. Rides proves in this record than they can deliver great music without it being commercial or radio friendly. Definetively a must for Reef fans, and for people that like alternative rock"
1,A non travel guide to Hong Kong!,I have never encountered a travel guide without any narration or description of sights. I have been to Hong Kong several times and knew what I was looking at. I made the mistake of purchasing this DVD to view with friends who had not been to Hong Kong. An unfamiliar viewer could have been looking at pictures of Rio or Seattle. A complete waste of time and money.
4,"Don't listen to bad reviews..,...from ""certain Djs"" LOL","Altough...I am Digweeds and Deep Dish fan...i really enjoy this one from Dave Ralph..I don't think it is flawless, flowing and groovy like my favorites..still its much better than most of it out there"
2,He's good live. He's horrible for compilations,"Do you have the ""Transport 2"" comp he did a while back? Did you like it? Then by all means get this then. But it does take the darker dirtier path of prog house though. It takes time to get going. It doesn't bang up. And for some reason the sound quality for this is horrible. you got to turn up the volume more than usual just to get some bass on it."
1,SIMPLY BAD,"First off, I am a DJ and consiter myself well versed in electronic music, especially trance. That said,I've seen dave ralph on a good few occasions(he is resident DJ at a club I frequent). He has spun some excellent live sets, however this album lacks that certian UMPH. In my opinion, this album is a bit too progressive. If I ever saw anyone spin this set somewhere live, I think I would either fall asleep from boredom, or vomit or something.If you like mad progged out (very chill) trance, then this album is for you. However, if you are like me and like music that pumps you up and makes you move, then save your money and buy something like George acosta - Release AM edition.Just my 2 cents.SP"
5,It Hurts Soooo Goooood,"Without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life is Starlight. Starlight is so bad, that it is great. With some of the most atrocious special effects, an incredibly odd and pointless story line, and tons of directing flaws, Starlight is a must have. You will find your self in awe of the utter stupidity of this flick. Now, you may ask yourself, ""I thought that girl was supposed to die if she was on Earth as long as she was. Wasn't that lame tattoo on the other side of that guy? Did they turn into moths at the end? Why the hell is he playing the fiddle? How did the motorcycle explode? What about her spaceship? What is going on?"" Well, take a deep breath and relax. It is just a flick, and a terrible one at that. Remember, never ask any questions in a flick where Willie Nelson gains magical powers from a totem pole that allows him to open dimensional portals. You must own this movie. I dare you to find anything worse than this."
5,Perfect for kids but may not work for you if you have a bad knee,"Bought this rebounder a few months ago for my 8 year old son and 11 year old daughter. Placed it in front of the TV. They both love exercising on it while watching TV. My daughter recently mentioned how good it makes her feel. Fellow students have observed how trim and athletic she looks, and I've also noticed how fit she looks. I also purchased the Urban Rebounder DVD, Kids Bound Urban Rebounding Compilation. There are 4 good workouts on this DVD that my kids learned and now use while working out and watching TV. I tried the machine myself and unfortunately with my bum knee it did not work out for me. The machine is well constructed and should give years of trouble free use. Overall I'm very happy with the product."
1,Not worth the price,"As a previous reviewer noted. The VC5 book is the same, and it came with a cd. The new book has minor changes, no cd, and is more expensive. Prosise's book is much better and actually has full sample programs."
1,"No CD, no stars","There is good information in this book, but the CD-ROM was one of the best features in the previous editions and removing it is inexcuseable."
1,What's taking so long??,I've been waiting since december to get this book and it still hasn't come out yet. For now I'll give this book 1 star for making me wait so long. I'll give a second opinion when I actually receive the book
5,Explanations for People who want to Understand,"This book wonderfully explains how MFC classes and concepts actually work. It allows you to work-by-understanding, as opposed to by example. His writting style is also livly and he doesn't leave out the important details like what a constant actually equals so you can avoid conflicts with it. I would say anyone who uses MSVC++ should have this book on their desk. The fact that there is no CD is a plus. You can learn from this book away from your computer. It's not littered with code that you skip anyway, but has the code where it's needed. Worth every penny."
3,Not much new; NO CD(!?),"I have the previous edition, and wanted to be sure I had Mike's latest view on any point I'm having trouble with. Noone knows as much about MFC as he does. That said though, after comparing the table of contents of this new edition and the previous one, I have to wonder if I have more money than brains. The page counts of some sections have increased a little, but there's just enough change in page layout to make it unclear if there's much new material at all. Also, even though my invoice said the book includes a CD, there is none. As an earlier review points out, the previous edition had one, and it even included the full text of the book. That's a major help when searching for something. For the price difference, I'd be hard pressed to recommend that anyone buy this new edition when they could get the previous one cheaper and also have the CD. If you already have the previous edition, save your money and prove you're smarter than me."
3,"confusing about the level, the previous version","I don't know what level this book for. sometimes high, sometimes extremely low."
5,this thing is GREAT.,"Forget those little windup timers that break cuz the plastic is cheap.This thing is easily adjustable, functions as a clock, and the alarm goes off for 1 full minute.It's definitely worth the extra cost."
2,"""Quick set"" is ""Hard to Set""","We have the rectangular BonJour timer. I was going to order another, but they are unavailable, so I tried this instead. This one seems flimsier, but more important is that the Quickset feature is not convenient to use. You rotate the outer portion of the timer to set the minutes, but there is no way to set seconds. Forget timing 90 seconds, for example. It even zeroes out the seconds if you try to add a minute while it is running. Also, the dial clicks as you turn it, but sometimes it ignores a click and sometimes it adds two minutes at a time."
2,Bonjour timer needs improvements,"ASIN:ASIN BonJour Large Readout Quickset Timer with Clock-Bonjour timer needs improvementsMy Bonjour timer didn't hold up to daily use. The loop handle broke off, the stand broke and the cover fell off the battery well and I can't get it to snap back on. Unfortunately, another product made in China that lacks durability."
1,Wally is King!,"Wally George is an absolute genius. The only thing better than this book is his toupee. He is the only man I know who wears two or three different hair pieces at the same time. And the colors never match. But I digress. This book is the monument Wally deserves. It is as sharp, intelligent and bitingly funny as he is (or isn't). It also manages to capture the complex human being who is Wally George. Is he really a master performance artists who lowers himself to the level of his audience? Or is he the borderline retard who doesn't know anything about politics or humor? You decide. All I can tell you is that watching Wally's show on Saturday nights is a bit like taking mushrooms: nothing makes sense. (For the really bold, try doing them both at the same time; it will scar you forever). Anyway, this book sucks just like Wally does. But his stupidity and awfulness is so great that he actually becomes funny and entertaining. Hard to believe, but true. Just like his hairpiece(s)."
1,Meretricious nonsense.,"It has always fascinated me how these radical right yahoos, who drip poison with their every public utterance, can fall back on what good Christians they are and how much they love their families. From George and Pyne to Downey and Limbaugh and down, they act in the most unChristian like manner possible as long as there are political points to score and ratings to be had, then try to convince the throng they're really swell fellows after all. George's book is part and parcel of this, and while it is not awfully written, it tells the Big Lie: that even though George was one of the first footsoldiers that led to the corruption of public discourse in America, he didn't really mean it like that.Sorry, but if I am going to read metretricious, self-justifying twaddle, at least I'll read some with genuine historical import; Mein Kampf is about that speed."
1,Wally George is a shriveled up old hack,"Wally George is a shriveled up old hack. The man has absolutely no talent in radio or writing, please for the love of God please do not torture yourself with this book. Bababooie, Bababooie"
1,Where's the rest.,This copy of the NOVA broadcast leaves too much of the original show untold. The original broadcast was rich in description of events and background information and allowed for the dramatic ending to be remembered for a lifetime. Unfortunately the DVD I purchased left too much of the original show out and sped through the events too quickly.The bottom line is this purchase is a disappointment.
5,Life Lessons,"(This review contains a spoiler). What makes this documentary exceptional is the way in which the men deal with incredible frustration and disappointment and bad luck. In the end, it really is the journey and effort that matters most."
2,Johnny please come back!,"Maybe now that Johnny Throckmorton has left Immortal Avenger he can come back to ATP. Then they can stop jerking around with new singers and screwing up their sound. I just can't get into this album. Oh well, I never get tired of listening to Staring at the Divine"
4,axe weilding - blistering balls to the wall rock and roll!,"Alabama Thunderpussy returns with a new vocalist. At first I was a little concerned that this album would be a let down and would not be a marked improvement over past efforts, including the timeless Constellation and Staring at the Divine. But Kyle Thomas simply adds more power, more emotional intensity and just plain opens the nozel and stokes the flames to unheard of heights. Ryan Lake and Erik Larson provide enough inspirational riffage and earth shattering solo work that my head hasn't stopped bouncing to some of the catchiest budweiser pounding, mug rasing mastery that the Thunder provides on this masterwork. Welcome to Valhalla mortals. Be thankful you are welcome amongst these gods of metal as they shake the very foundations of your soul."
5,One of the Most underated metal bands in America,"I had a chance to meet some of the guys like Eric Larson and Bryan Cox and have a few shots and some beers. I First saw them open for COC and I have been hooked since the first riff.This album is balls to the wall metal. I have trouble describing it because it is such a unique sound that gives way to their influences from Sabbath to Skynyrd. I have told my friends try to imagine what it would sound like if Black Sabbath had been born and raised in Alabama instead of Birmingham, England.All I can say is buy this frigging album. If you are like me and are sick of all the cookbook rock out there then this will cure what ales ya. I believe Alabama Thunderspussy is 1 of the 2 most under rated metal bands in the world. (Monster Magnet is the other)"
4,He Loved it!,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has to travel often and loves to take pictures of our daughter with him as he misses her when he is gone. I thought this would be great since he can not only see her, but hear her as well. It was a little challenging to get the pictures in the frames and then back into the main frame, but after getting them back in, it looks good, is compact for traveling and he LOVED it!!! Even looks good sitting on our dresser in between trips! I would recommend this item."
1,Only one recorder worked.,"If I had an option to give this a zero star rating, I would. One of the recorder/speaker did not work. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to return and/or exchange since this was a gift. I contacted Amazon to express my dissatisfaction, but they were not helpful at all. They told me to return the item! Okay, so I'm going to ask the recipient to return his gift and to wait for another one that may or may not arrive in a month?! Give me a break! I am extremely unhappy with the product and Amazon's service."
2,book review,"when starting this book i found it quite heavy reading but as i read on, I began to enjoy it more. It was ok but it was too similar all the was through which caused a loss of intrest in the latter parts"
4,Best flight lesson primer,I have most of the FAA books and this one is far superior for learning the basic required flight maneuvers toward private pilot.Only downside is the massive size and weight but the book is clear and easy to use to explain complex things like pattern work and turns.
4,Agree with Tiff,"I have to say that as much as I loved the old series and have a new appreciation for the dvd format, its unbelievably annoying to have these workouts all on one track. If you're purchasing a longer workout dvd and wish to skip thru certain sections of the workout for whatever reason, you have to sit there and FF through it instead of being able to skip through track to track like any other dvd. The only one that was even remotely close was the full cardio workout dvd and even that one would have at least three segments thru each track. I just wish they would tailor it more for those who aren't able to take the time for each and every segment."
3,Not as good as previous Firm workouts,"I bought this dvd expecting the same high-end production as the previous Firm videos and similar challenging workouts. I was disappointed in both respects. I have been an avid Firm follower for the last six years. But since their production has changed (for whatever reason), their workouts lack the same stylish sets, less challenging excercises and even the music doesn't seem as fun. Granted, nice sets and music do not make a workout better, their approach has changed and I felt let down. I don't feel as challenged during the workout. I would definitely recommend the older series of videos. Also, noting on a comment in a previous review about the tatoos on Ali, I also was not too impressed with this. I personally prefer my instructors tatoo-free (or at least in places I can't see them). In earlier videos she didn't have them, so to me it's a question of: what was she thinkink?"
1,Horrible,"this is the worst exercising dvd, that i ever bought1- the instructor is much more overweighted than its shown at the cover of the dvd, it was hard for me to look at dvd, when u see someone that is not fit tryin to teach u how to work out. wheres the motivation?2- the moves were real fast, she goes from one move to the next without explain much3- u have to buy the pogo stick and and foot stepper, if u buy this dvd, u have to spend more money to workoutwhat a disappointment !!!the dvd that i recommend for people to buy is the Crunch cardio salsa, its fun to exercise in different latin dances. the music is upbeat."
2,Stick with the older Firm series,"I found this video to be significantly less challenging than many others in the Firm series. I'd barely broken a sweat by the end. Also, the Abs Section is hardly 5 minutes long.The format of the DVD isn't broken into segments like some of the others I've used. The entire content of the DVD is in one track, requiring fast-forwarding through the front matter each viewing, a waste of the available technology."
4,Great total body workout,"I actually bought this at Walmart as a 4 pack (came with Total Sculpt plus Abs, Complete Aerobics & weight training, and Firm Abs) for $27.I felt as though my entire body got a toning work out along with a fairly good cardio workout. The cardio was a bit segmented though - each section requires different equipment so you're constantly starting and stopping (the reason for the 4 stars). So if you're looking for an intense cardio, this probably isn't it. But I was drenched in sweat when it was over, so I felt like I got a good workout. The 6 minute standing leg toning section is tough and good.Overall, this is a good workout that keeps your interest throughout."
3,Didn't feel productive...,"This dvd is hard to follow, and reminds me of a gym class workout in highschool. The production is pretty lame, the music is hard to hear, and I had the same complaint about Complete aerobics, why do they put the women for beginners all the way in the back? How can someone who has no idea what they are doing follow someone they can barely see?But just in defense to the instructor, who cares that she has tattoos? And I wouldn't say she is out of shape, I would much rather be a full figured, toned woman then some of the other women in these tapes. Don't make up excuses for not working out, the tape is hard, but the tattoos didn't make it hard.If you want a good workout I would try Complete aerobics by The Firm. It will seem hard in the beginning but if you stick with it, you will definetly see results, and feel good about yourself when you finish.Maybe I will try this dvd again but my first impression of it was that the production made it impossible to follow the routine."
1,Not for the advanced exerciser,"I couldn't agree more with CW's review. This is an extremely easy workout, especially given the misleading name of ""maximum cardio"". Although Allie is a good instructor, the cuing was off, and the stick annoying. If you want a better cardio workout, choose Super Cardio, or Maximum Cardio Burn."
5,My favorite workout DVD,"I've been doing this workout for about seven weeks and I can see the results. Alli is my favorite Firm Instructor and I don't think she's overweight and I also did't find her tatoos distracting like others said...I bought it to work out I don't go around pointing out what I don't like...I guess some people find it easier to talk about what they don't like instead of what they like...Back to the DVD, I'm glad I bought it. I combine it with Complete Aerobics and Weight Training to get a full body workout."
3,Not enough Strength,"Too much cardio in this video, and the cardio isn't really challenging. I was hoping there be more work with weights or more strength training."
5,I love this DVD,"This is my favorite firm workout. I am an avid exerciser, and I find this workout to be fun, challenging, and uplifting. Allie is my favorite instructor, regardless of her tatoos??? She has a gorgeous body, I am thin for my height, and I am somewhat envious of her curves. All in all though, this dvd is a good workout, I have the equipment, but I agree that it isn't necessary to have it to get a good workout from this dvd. The segments go by fast, and I usually sneak it in before work for my cardio. It is work getting up at 5 am for!"
4,Great for Light Training Days,"I use this on my light training days. It's a great break between other Step routines; I dig the combination of weights and cardio!The main reason I'm writing, is due to some of the past comments that have been written, in regards to Allie. I cannot believe how snobby some of these reviews have been...from comments about her weight, to her tatoos, its just pitful how self-absorbed and trite some of these reviewers are.Shame on you! Exercise is for everyone!! Even if you have tatoos, piercings, black, white, fat, thin...Exercise is not just for the skinny and so-called ""perfect"" people.If you're new to Max Cardio Burn, do not allow these judgemental reviewers to cloud your vision. This is a great video for light training days, the steps are easy to follow, and, you don't need the sculpting stick (I just use my weights and step!) to perform the exercises."
2,not worth the money,"This is the only FIRM video that I have not liked. I liked how she did five-minute segments; but I didn't like what was in them. There is kickboxing which is mostly arm movements, the step part was okay, and the low-impact is things like moving your arms and legs in front of you and behind you. I felt like I was back in junior high PE. I didn't use the sculpting stick; one could substitute 3 to 5 pound weights in each hand. And I am perfectly able to balance. I also have had no results. I weigh and look the same. I highly recommend the other FRIM videos (I really like them as a whole) but would pass on this one."
3,"""INTENSE AT FIRST. NOW, MY FAVORITE""","Overall it is a good workout but it doesn't give you time to recover from one segment to the other. And besides that, after an intense segment the instructor stops too fast and change to another intense segment very quickly.At least a couple of breething exercise should be allowed to be prepare for the next segment without pausing the DVD.The above comment was written after doing the workout just 3 to 5 times. But after doing the workout for 3 to 4 months I certainly say that this workout is the best. I have lost 10 pounds so far. Now, I am in better shape to handle the entire workout without stopping. Thanks to my consistency I can see the great benefits of this workout."
1,Just never worked,This is item did not recharge my Ipod. If you want a display holder for your Ipod .. Buy this!
4,Derivative,"The author takes elements and plot that we've seen before, many times, and gives us a protaganist that we like to follow. Dumb enough to fall, smart enough to know he's hooked. We go along for the ride."
1,Unreal,I was ver disappointed when I opened this to fine that I paid almost $10 for a container of grits that normally cost no more than $3 plus the package didn't have a invoice or return label.
1,Bad Labeling?,"I ordered these and recieved Quaker 5-Minutes Quick Grits instead of Old Fashioned. No problem returning them (other than the hassle), but not what I was expecting"
5,Cute and Sturdy,The bowl is incredibly cute and can withstand my ferrets trying to tip it over. They are able to push it but haven't knocked it over. It holds a good amount of food and is easy to clean. Good purchase.
3,great bowl but..,"this is a cute bowl and its very sturdy, however my guinea pigs are very large, so needless to say they kept flipping it over. I ended up using it for my chinchillas who dont flip it over."
4,Very nice !!,"I ordered these for our new Guinea pigs. They are nice and heavy. The picture isn't the same as in the ad but its still nice. I plan on ordering more to have replacements when the others need to be washed. My guinea pigs are still babies and have climbed into the bowls a few times, but its haven't tipped over which is nice !!!"
4,Guinea Pig PetWare Bowl,"Hard to find nice ""home"" items for pets other than cats and dogs.Was happy you had this.So is our guinea pig, Timothy."
2,they tip over easily,"Light green and a somewhat dark blue were the colors I received of the two ordered. The design of the guinea pigs was a lot more detailed and not as nice as the simple ones shown in the images, but I guess that's preference. The main problem with these bowls is that they're easily pulled over by guinea pigs. That leaves a mess and dust on the floor of the cage."
4,"Solid Bowl, A Little Small, Cute Pictures","Unfortunately, our two male guinea pigs started fighting (well one was doing all the bullying and the other was a big woosy) so we had to separate them and get double of everything. This was our second food bowl. You need one that is heavy and not easily tipped and this fits the ticket. It is a little smaller than our first one but the design on the outside is cute and it does hold enough food for a day or two.A good purchase."
4,Good Size and Hard to Tip Over!,I bought this to use as a treat bowl for my Mini Lop bunny (no I don't fill up the whole thing with treats!) I love it because it's hard for him to pick it up and tip it over while there is stuff inside (which saves me money on replacing treats constantly!)
3,Bunny paw print bowl,"Hi,The bunny bowl is way too small. It needs to be larger in diameter. I love the color and print on it. Thanks and Jesus Loves YOU!"
2,Item Received Was Circular Ceramic Bowl,"The item I received was nothing like the picture of this item. The picture is of a rectangular feeding bowl with a top storage bin. What I received was a tiny circular ceramic bowl, which I already had. With that said, Amazon made the Return process painless."
2,Nowhere near item pictured,"I ordered two of these bowls. I was well aware of the fact that amazon listed that ""colors may vary"". The bowls that actually arrived looked absolutely nothing like the photo. They arrived in purple with grey cartoon-style rabbits (think of a cheezey rendition of Bugs Bunny) screen printed around the edges and printing on the inside of the bowl. I immediately returned them. The return experience through amazon was pleasant and hassle-free."
2,IMPROBABLE NY PUNK ROCK DRAMATIC MUSICAL,"A punk rock story directed by Alan Moyle, creator of ""PUMP UP THE VOLUME."" Two teens, a rich politician's daughter and a wild street kid, escape from a psychiatric hospital and with the help of disc jockey Tim Curry become punk rock heroes on the streets of New York City. An incredible soundtrack of hits from Patti Smith, The Cure, Lou reed, The Ramones, The Pretenders, Roxy Music, Suzi Quatro, Talking Heads and more! Bonus features include an audio commentary with Alan Moyle and star Robin Johnson plus theatrical trailers. (Widescreen, Surround 5.1, 111 minutes, Rated R)"
3,This Movie is so Silly it's Fun,"Ready to watch it? Let your imagination run wild and don't expect the movie or Times Square to be like it is in the movie, or that anything like that could even partially happen. First of all it's already funny to glamorize sleezy Times Square in New York. Nikki and Pammy call themselves the sleeze sisters. How appropriate. The soundtrack is good and I own this movie and enjoy it whenever I see it. I don't have a movie in my collection that I wouldn't watch over again. Every time I see it the movie is corny and funnier to me. I gave it 3 stars because it isn't a great movie but it is a movie that to me is fun to watch. To me it's a ""cult classic"" like the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", not meant to be taken seriously but enjoyed."
2,* * 1/2 Stars,"Besides the two cute lead actresses, this film goes absolutely nowhere. I can't imagine anyone with any remote intelligence, (maybe curiosity) sitting through this film more then one time, and even that's a bit painful. Popular probably only because of a rocking soundtrack. It's cult, underground, and rare, so that must be what all the fuss is about. Seriously, good only for curiosity's sake. Now having said that, it's always a pleasure to watch Tim Curry, a very under rated actor. (I'd feel guilty selling my copy for more than $10 bucks.) Jeez, the trouble I went through trying to get my hands on this too."
5,AWESOME,"AWESOME MOVIE, ENOUGH SAID!!!! I REMEMBER THIS MOVIE FROM WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND SIMPLY LOVED IT AS IT IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES."
1,Placebo,"It's funny that the product says that it is ""Non-drowsy, non-habit forming, no known drug interactions""... that's because it's a placebo. You're basically paying $20 for salt water. Don't believe me? This ""drug"" is homeopathic. As Wikipedia says, ""Scientific research has found homeopathic remedies ineffective and their postulated mechanisms of action implausible.""Don't be an idiot. Get real medicine."
5,Works for me!!!,"I was previously taking different an over the counter remedy. I unfortunately started to get a reaction to it over time. I became dehydrated, I didn't sweat during the summer months, almost passed out a few times; when I blew my nose nothing came out and I became cold sensitive.I react to almost all medications and was starting to get concerned as my allergies are pretty bad. (Prescription medications are even worse!!!- can't take them). I came across this medication and tried it. It works!!! It only takes about 15 minutes to feel my nasal passages begin to clear. For continual relief I should take it every 4-6 hours but I only take it in the morning. I may take another dosage in the afternoon if my symptoms are really bad. I was running out of options ans am so glad I found this. I will look towards homeopathic solutions in the future for any other problems I encounter."
5,I'm hooked on IZZ,"I bought this CD based on a review I read. The review was right! This CD is amazing! IZZ offers the listener something new with every song. From beautifully orchestrated arangements like ""Where I Belong"", to the edgy ""Razor"", to the Celtic flavored playfulness of ""Lorna Doone"" - IZZ has me hooked!"
1,progress backward,"Upon hearing this group play at a local college event, a progressive and fresh sound seemed to be promised. How wrong could a person be. Same old stuff with a fruity lead singer. I did not enjoy it at all. As confusing as the izzstory is on their website, confusion is what could ever come over a person giving this cd a great review."
1,Pathetic is a complement,"the band is a copy off of every old 60s band, the music itself would not even be considered popular, and it is overall not well thought out or produced. the songs sound as if they are recorded two blocks awy, and the methodic piano an guitar loops leave me as a music fan extremely dissapointed. IT IS GENEROUS TO GIVE THIS ONE STAR!"
5,A musical feast .,There is real talent on this cd and it shines on every song. I'm absolutely lovin it!
4,IZZ - Nice Debut Album,"Izz is in my opinion one of the best new bands to come out of the east coast progressive rock scene in the last decade. Their brand of progressive rock mixed in with a good dose of pop is a great combination. On their debut album ""Sliver Of A Sun"" the band shows obvious promise, but is somewhat in search of a direction. The material ranges all over the place from modern rock, progressive rock, pop, Celtic, ballads, you name it, it's here. Some songs work better than others, but overall it is a nice blend from a talented bunch of folks. Highlights for me are ""Endless Calling"", the Celtic ""Lornadoone"", ""Meteor"", and the closing track ""Where I belong"" where the girls take the lead vocals. ""Sliver Of A Sun"" is a very nice debut album. The band would go on to do better stuff, but this was a very good start."
5,IZZ kicks ass!!!,"I haven't heard anything this good in a long time. This band obviously has real talent and I'm sure they will become a runaway success once they hit the mainstream. Even though my balls aren't crystal, I do see big things in this band's future"
2,Disappointing CD but Potential is there,"I heard IZZ play in a local bar and enthusiastically picked up the CD. There a great live band but the CD sounds like a band trying to mimic the sound of the great Beatles or Pink Floyd. The groups has talent, but need a fresh sound, not a mimickrey of someone elses. In a time when rock desperately needs a new sound and direction, IZZ is another copy cat band."
1,simply put: the worst,This was undoubtedly the biggest piece of ish album i've ever bought in my life.
4,Good sound.,This has become one of my favorite cds. It's not a bit boring because it has a good mix of styles.Such a different approach to songwriting too. I'm very interested in following this band.
4,good recording of a brilliant piece,"John Cage's score for this is fantastic -- including rhythmically exciting music & very sparing, ethereal music; & even specific instructions on how to prepare the piano: where on which strings to put the bolts & things (but every time you prepare the piano you have to do it slightly differently). I like Aleck Karis's performance of the piece, but I've heard better performances, & unless you have other recordings & just want this one too, I'd expect that you could find other recordings of this piece that you'd prefer."
4,I liked this product. It tasted okay and ...,"I liked this product. It tasted okay and was very fast acting. I think that it does just as good a job as Rolaids or Tums, but it's more expensive -- so it would have to be on sale for me to buy it again."
4,I thought these antacid tablets worked well. I ...,"I thought these antacid tablets worked well. I wasn't impressed with the packaging. It's not as """"pretty"""" as most bottles of antacids. The flavor wasn't as good as other brands I've tried. They do serve the purpose, however."
3,Average Date Movie,"This movie was nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad. It's an alright choice for a date movie."
2,Worse Than I Thought,"I love Jennifer Aniston. I basically try to watch any movie she makes. I read the other reviews and thought, really, how bad could it be? Listen to the two star reviewers -- it really is that bad. This movie can't figure out what tone it wants to strike. It doesn't know what it is, so it ends up being an unwatcheable mess. You end up with strange, cartoonish subplots and relentlessly grating bickering. I still give it two stars because I love Jennifer Aniston anyway."
1,STOP THE MADNESS --- JENNIFER QUIT MAKING MOVIES!!!!!!!!,JENNIFER ANNISTON IS A TV ACTRESS.WHY DO THEY STILL KEEP MAKING THIS AWFUL MOVIES WITH HER. THE SAME PLOT.JENNIFER ANNISTON IS NOTHING BUT HER OWN BIGGEST FAN. SO SICK OF HER AND HER SELF PROMOTION. WITH MOVIESLOSING MONEY.................SHE IS BOX OFFICE POISION........................ THEY USE THE SAME FORMULAPUT HER WITH WHATEVER ACTOR IS HOT NOW AND MAKE ANOTHER BOX OFFICE COMEDY FLOP!
1,What a waste of time!,"Jennifer Aniston just can't stay away from the same one dimensional characters its like she's stuck in some actors fog or too lazy in her acting or just to scare to do a different role. She had me happy for her in the movie, Derailed I thought finally her acting roles are going somewhere, but 5 years later we get this?! Someone needs to tell Jennifer the truth, she needs to start acting in roles that are different for her and show her true acting abilites. And What is Gerard Butler doing is this movie this is so beneath him, he has done some great movies for instance: Reign of Fire, 300, one of his best roles to date Law Abiding Citizen why did he choose this role?! As for this film just like Greenburg it is another movie that should have never been made!"
2,what a waste of my precious time,"The Bounty Hunter isn't even remotely funny. Even though it's not really a romance comedy, it sure *feels* like one because of how fruity and nonchalant the whole storyline is. The action bits feel like they were created by a bunch of 5 year olds, or rather, created by a group of writers that were going for something only a *very* select few would be able to appreciate.I guess I shouldn't be surprised with the main character being Jennifer Aniston. She's not the kind of actress to star in really exciting action-packed films. No, this is definitely NOT a suspense- it's a really pitiful attempt at a comedy involving far-fetched and pointless ""bounty hunter"" *comedy* segments- completely unsuspenseful.As soon as I found out there was no suspense, well, I said to myself ""Maybe I can appreciate it as a comedy film"". Nope. I couldn't. Not when I had to sit through one failed attempt at humor after another.Just skip it."
1,Dreadful,"This could have been an enjoyable romantic comedy. Yet, so much went wrong with it. There is a lack of chemistry between the leads. The tone of their relationship is cruel, abusive, manipulative, and demeaning. The rest of the cast seems to be a collection of embittered people without even a hint of humanity. There is not one like-able character in the entire ensemble. The last minute ""happy ending"" doesn't compensate for the dreadful journey getting there. Don't waste your time (or money) on this one!"
2,Truly Awful,"This is a truly awful movie. Generally I'll watch anything and find something redeeming about it, but even with the lovely Jennifer Anniston, this is a waste of time."
2,Couldn't Finish Movie,"I seldom turn off a movie without finishing it, but I couldn't get through this movie. It was slow moving and boring. I was surprised as I like Jennifer and Gerard. I got maybe half way through the movie and found myself staring to do other things while the movie was on and just decided to turn it off."
2,"Bounty Hunt To Find Love, Again","Sometimes, the hardest thing is admitting your failure at love. Despite differences and egos between two people, we all have mistakes. Owning up to it is the hardest thing and finding love through a second chance is special. Even if it involves this absurd journey where two people who start off hating each other are thrust into a tight bind and need each other to survive.The Bounty Hunter, starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston is just another comedic romance. The film tries to develop the story by introducing suspense and mystery as to why the bounty hunter who is chasing his ex-wife is suddenly being hunted himself.It has an identity crisis that never fully lives up to anything more than just another comedic love comedy movie. There are too many movies and I would only recommend if your a fan of both Aniston and Butler."
3,bounty hunter review,point blank this movie tried too hard to be funny which it isn't. it really dragged. skip this one.
2,A waste of Gerard Butler's talent,"Gerard Butler is a good actor that is wasted on this movie. Just check out ""Dear Frankie"" and ""PS I Love You."" But this movie was just so boring that the 111 minutes seemed like forever. Jennifer Aniston looks great but in my opinion, it doesn't matter what movie she's in, she acts the same. I don't see the character, just Jennifer Aniston. The Stewart character was especially annoying. The character I loved in this movie is Nicole's mom, Kitty who is played by Christine Baranski. She was funny as always."
2,"""Keep your enemies close, keep your Ex closer.""","Gerald Butler is a great actor, however I thought he fell short in this one. Their chemistry was good and in the end, they got their second chance. It was just the storyline in between that could have been more exciting. As allways, Jennifer Aniston looked incredible and gave as good as she got."
3,Cute Movie,"I think this is a good solid 3 1/2 star movie--definitely one of the best Jennifer Aniston's ever done. There isn't much depth to the characters, but the storyline is entertaining and there are some comical moments. For me, this is a good movie to have on in the background (after watching it in its entirety first). Overall, the movie is not necessarily something to rave about, but it's cuter than I expected. I think it's worth watching (and owning if you buy it at a good price)."
3,Bounrty Hunter,"This is a cute comedy, well acted. Not the funniest picture I've seen but a lot of fun."
2,Predictable and silly at times,"Jennifer Aniston over plays her role as a silly impulsive news reporter who finds herself in trouble with the law resulting in a shallow tale of her and her ex husband.If any woman in her 30's could act as silly as Aniston portrays her character, I'd be surprised. At times this movie borders on slap stick comedy.If you are a woman, and you are romantic, and love Jennifer Aniston, and like boy meets girl movies, then you may enjoy this one.If your a guy, bring lots of beer for this one.It is so predictable with virtually ever story line having been over explored since the early 1900's in cinema and later in TV."
2,"Total Formula, No Sparkle -","Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler) is a bounty hunter, recently divorced and recently fired from the police department. He has gambling debts to pay and becomes ecstatic when he realizes his latest gig is bail-skipper ex wife, Nicole (Jennifer Aniston). Not only does he get to nab Nicole, this job pays a whopping $50,000, much more than the usual fare. The plot is set, but this becomes formula comedy chase and make-up. Nicole has no intention of getting nabbed without a fight. Complicating matters, Nicole's wannabe-boyfriend, Stewart (Jason Sudeikis) joins the chase.The movie was just a basic formula script, thrown together to make a buck on the star power of Jennifer Aniston. She does her best to save it, but it just falls like heavy bread. There is no sparkle to make it work."
2,Disappointing,"I was thinking that with two solid actors playing the lead roles in this film, it would be funny to watch and a good satire on bounty hunters. But it turned out to be a big letdown in more ways than one. The story didn't have a very good plot, and the writing came across as really sloppy with a very bad ending. It started off with promise - as so many bad movies do - but it only went downhill from there. Definitely not a best for Jennifer or Gerard."
1,Worse Than I Expected,Wwow..what a dud! I didn't have high hopes for this one. The trailer looked like this would be a movie with a few laughs. This movie sucked. There was nothing to it. The potetnial was there but it fell flat. Neither Butler or Aniston were funny or made the movie work. the idea that they got involved in a police investigation and the activities that followed were just ridiculous. Characters were stupid. Certainly not a comedy.What a waste of time.
2,Disappointed,"I guess I am disappointed in the roles Gerard Butler is taking lately. His work earlier in THE JURY and DEAR FRANKIE showed much more depth in feeling and better acting skill. These shallow stories with cheap story lines and foul language may sell, but they do not entertain nor endure the movies nor the actors to the public."
1,Banal Banal Banal... No Kidding!!!,"It's stupid, of course. Jennifer ""No Range"" Anniston is in it. She plays, once again, a semi-ditzy princess with man problems. Gerard Butler reprises his mouth paralysis delivery. Talk about type-cast. He even manages to wear the same clothes in every movie. Are sofa bound middle-class Americans this pathetic, that they lap up this trash for entertainment. I hope not. Airplane movie where you sleep through most, luckily."
5,fun movie,This is a fun movie. One of the best I have ever seen Jennifer Aniston in. Gerard Butler was perfect as the ex husband who is thrilled to take his ex wife to jail. It was also great to watch a movie that was not full of foul language and explicit sex. A good script. This is one of the best comedies hollywood has made in years.This one is a rewatcher.
1,Suxs.... NOT FUNNY!,"I wanted to buy this movie but my boyfriend decided we should rent it first from redbox before buying to decide if its really a Great movie. Well the movie was BAD really BAD... and WORST of ALL its NOT a FUNNY movie! I feel so BAD for Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler they're really, really GOOD actors but the people who wrote, produced and directed this movie should have done much better because now they just made two great actors look really really BAD!!!"
3,corny,this movie was very corny. almost did not see this movie just b/c i hate teh pertual child jenifer aniston . I love gerard bulter so i saw it and i think that it was not teh greatest role for our sexy action hero. gerard bulter as the lovable loser just does not work
2,"The Bounty Hunter has no chemistry, Gerard Butler needs to stop rom-coms!","Length:: 6:29 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews ""The Bounty Hunter"" directed by Andy Tennant and starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston. An ex-cop gets to go after his ex-wife who jumped bail, revenge for all divorcees who hate their ex's.[...]"
2,It was just too silly,"I'm glad I rented this movie and didn't buy it. The film actually started out pretty well and there were lots of laughs to enjoy, however the antics of Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler just got tedious after a while. Situations began to be telegraphed and the movie just fell apart in the second half as it was apparent that there was too much effort going into just being funny. The film labored and grew painful to watch. I won't say don't watch it because it was humorous for a while, but for me, it just left me feeling empty."
2,low budget,I was hoping the best for this movie. The movie was drawn out and had a lame story.This movie was a desperate attempt to keep Jennifer Anistons career going.The story was basically a run around catch me if you can. Can clearly see that Jennifer Aniston had botox put in her upper lip-certain times she looked liked she was punched in the mouth (deal with age Jennifer).I still don't see what directors see in Gerard Butler. He is not a very good actor. So happy I viewed it first.watch it if you have nothing better to do. But all in all it was a really stupid movie.
3,"not good, not bad",This was a rather bland movie. I downloaded the kindle version and wasn't able to view full screen because it kept breaking up like pictures moving separately. The best part of the movie is shown in the trailer.
5,Great Movie.,"I thought the movie was great. It had action,comedy,love. I love Gerard Butler's actiing. Jennifer was great. They both did a wonderful job. I like seeing Gerard as the main attracton in his movies."
2,Boring,"Well, I think the whole movie fell to pieces due to Jennifer's acting, which was not very good. Then how could you go wrong with Butler's performance? He was the heart of the film. I really only got a laugh in the last 10 minutes of the film, so don't expect this to be too funny."
3,Movie,its a ok movie by far not the best I bought it used so I'm out only a few bucks would watch it again only when there is nothing on tv shipped and rec on time will buy from this seller again.
2,I kept forgetting what the movie was about,"Oh, where to begin?The script was all over the place. I didn't believe for a moment that Jennifer Aniston's character was a reporter. They didn't establish her character or any of the characters enough for us to care. What was that co-worker reporter for in the script? I thought he was annoying. The chemistry between the lead actors was just okay but not great. What is so special about Gerald Butler? He may have his charm but not in this film. Better direction might have helped.Jennifer Aniston is due a good film."
2,"An 'Un-funny, funny' movie","I received the product on time and in the advertised condition. There were no nicks or skips and it played fine, therefore, I would recommend this seller to anyone considering a purchase from him.The movie itself was not a funny as advertised, but it was a good way to spend an hour or so.Larry"
3,"Predictable plot, poor acting","If you like Jennifer Aniston or Gerard Butler then it's probably worth your time as far as ""eye candy"". However the acting is an embarrasment on both actor's parts. For Butler, this is a far cry from the days of ""300"", too much fake laughter. For Aniston, it seems like she's a newcomer to acting with her ""I can't believe you're ...."" all of the time.We get it...they still have the hots for each other so of course movie magic happens and they fall in love again. Yippee. They both must have been desperate for work as the plot is lame and predictable.Don't buy this, rent it, or check it out at your local library for free. Not worth your $."
2,BORRRIIIIINNNGGG,How could two such lovely actors be so boring? Do not waste your money or time. I am a fan of both these actors and was disappointed. Very cliched script so probably wasn't their fault except for choosing to act in this movie
1,Go Directly to DVD!,"Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler make horrible music together in yet another glorified sitcom. ""The Bounty Hunter"" belongs in the DVD bargain bin rather than the big screen. No laughs, no chemistry, no cinematic value - which sums up Aniston's generic romantic-comedy oeuvre."
2,chick flick,"i enjoyed the movie, thought that jennifer aniston needs to get a movie that would make her act like a different person. Butler was hot and I thought that he did great considering who he had to work with."
1,Has anyone noticed....,"that Jennifer Aniston just can't act?I have nothing against her. In interviews she seems to be a very nice person and she is quite attractive. By all accounts she is good to work with, and a hard worker.But she can't act. She really can't. In every role she is simply another very similar version of herself. It's painful to watch in large part because she does seem to be such a nice person.This movie could have worked with a decent actress in the lead role, but it's just annoying, and even a bit embarrasing, to watch Jennifer Aniston try to act."
4,Love it,"Talk about being between a rock and a hard place. Which is better a stalker who has it in his head that you share a relationship with him or an ex-husband who is determined to have you arrested. Plenty of tension, chemistry and laughs throughout this movie ?? I found I was more interested in the developement between the former couple than I was in the suspense looming over their heads as the crooks chased. I insist that there was chemistry between Aniston and Butler. The kind you would have between two persons where one personality is unorthodox and the other is a bit uptight and they have already been down the romance path."
2,just opinions,"With all the great fantasy to read, how coul anyone give this book more than 3 stars.You can't relate to any characters in this tale. The story, even for fantasy, is silly, overdone, and plain boring.Resnick is quite a writer, she would do well if she could develop charachters and events as Hobb, Flewilling, J.V. Jones.Trying to sound like Martin(no one can touch him)and somewhat like Jordan, who has ruined his career with his eleven book fantasy that has no ending(read the first six, after that, he is an idiot).This series will do well, however, as most readers are less circumspect than me when it comes to good fantasy."
1,monsignor renard,"This is ,without doubt ,the worst Amazon product I have ever bought . I have the original on VHS. I was quite exited when I saw it advertised on DVD. Little did I know how badly it was edited. Almost one hour is deleted from the original and the ridiculous 'added' commentary is dreadful.Poor John Thaw,what would he have thought. . I can either put in the bin or let you have it back. Which do you suggest? JOHN GOLDSMITH,Birmingham,England"
1,Disappointed with formatting of this movie,"This single disc only contained the first three episodes of the (four episode) series. I don't think the seller knew this, as I've read other reports on Amazon (and on [...]) that suggest the same trouble with formatting, and a severe edit of the orginal production. I expected the full, four part series, and am beginning to suspect that part four isn't even available."
1,Hacked to pieces,This is 232 minutes.The version available at Amazon.co.uk is 295 minutes and considerably less expensive.
3,"If you remember Skywald, it's a nice book","Skywald in the 70s was an imitator of the lowbrow but moderately successful B&W; Warren comics magazines. I bought many horror comics way back then, so I had some Skywalds. This book is a nostalgic reminder of magazines long lost, just enough to remind the reader of what they once were. They weren't much, really.If you're young and grew up in the 80s or 90s, you probably won't get much from this volume. If you were one of the few who were alive and buying comics in the 1970s, you may get a little kick from this book."
5,"Excellent, But Some Contradictions","This is an excellent book. The reviews of individual cards are represented from two views, so there is some variation, but most of the rankings are right next to each other. The place where the contradictions come in are that when the whole set is looked at, many of the ""must-have"" cards were rated middle-of-the-pack during individual reviews.The other material in the book is worth the price alone. Good suggestions on strategy and deck building, with many sample decks shown."
2,Good idea with a major flaw...,"If you're looking for French resources to learn the language with your children, I can't recommend French For Beginners without reservation. Many of the songs are cute and catchy (with the exception of the highly irritating alphabet song), and teach common vocabulary like numbers, food, colors, days of the week, animals, and greetings. One side is mostly French to English; the other side has the same songs - English to French.However, the children on the recording (with one possible exception) are NOT native French speakers, and don't even sound as if they were well coached. The pronunciation of many sections is so bad, it sounds like a person with no knowledge of French saying the words for the first time. This ruined it for me - catchy tunes are of no benefit if they can't pronounce the words right! What a shame, because this would be a lovely resource otherwise."
3,A Round Robin Mystery,"This is a readable tale for a rainy evening, but using thirteen authhors for the thirteen chapters resulted in some extreme changes of direction. It sounded like a cast of characters with multiple personality disorders. Some chapters are better than others. Caroline's raid on the kitchen is really funny. But other chapters don't seem to come across as well. A few situations are transparent, and others are a bit of a stretch. Perhaps it ended up with too many twists and turns."
2,Definitely a disappointment,"Considering some of my favorite authors were involved in this collaboration I had high hopes of a fast paced, fun mystery. It was OK but the little things bothered me. The policeman who was described as a bear and a Columbo type and then described by another author as a hunk. Caroline, the main character, didn't seem to be consistent in her behavior or her characterization. And the ending seemed rushed and a little trite. I thought the explaination of the bikini bottom was silly and unclear.Although my husband also reads a number of these authors I couldn't even recommend the book to him. Just not worth the time."
1,Not recommended,"I have enjoyed all of J.D. Robb's books and I was looking forward to sampling some of the other authors' writing. However, it was difficult to enjoy this book. There was little depth in character development and the plot was illogical and unconvincing. Perhaps this is typical of this type of serial novel, but this was a disappointing read."
3,A Blah Blend,"Nice idea, nice effort, but with a blah outcome. These writers, who are superstars in their own write, had to suppress too much of their natural talent to weave a seamless story. Don't buy, go to the library."
1,One of the worst,This is definitely one of the worst books I have read recently. The plot develops into one of the silliest and least plausible storylines. Save yourself the time and money and watch an episode of Sally Jessy Raphael or one of the soaps - I'm sure you'll be more entertained.
2,"Sorry, I didn't like it","Maybe my expectations were wrong? I don't care for nonsense. With writers like Lisa Scottoline and Anne Perry involved, I was hoping for a mystery that would be worth reading even without the ""serial"" gimmick. But all this has to recommend it is the ingenuity with which the authors fit the pieces together. I give it two stars for that, though I keep being tempted to cut it back to one. The plot is silly and unbelievable, and I found only one likable character--not the heroine."
3,So so!,"I was hoping for individual stories. Instead, there was each author trying to complete the story in their own way. I had to go back to refresh my memory of the previous chapter. From now on, I'll only just get J D Robb's books. She makes more sense than the other authors."
4,Whose line is it anyway?,"In reading ""Naked Came the Phoenix"" I found myself trying to determine whose voice I was reading with each chapter. I failed miserably at it, I might add, because each one of these immensely talented writers seemed to have so much fun with their chapter, expanding and twisting the plot and characters, that they could step outside of their norm. The book was great fun, the characters enhanced at each twist and the greatest fun was not being able to come close to guessing how it would turn out or who the ""bad guy"" was. It's a pretty light read, or maybe it was just so much fun that I didn't want to put it down until the end. Spoiler alert: the chapters' authors are listed at the end."
4,Interesting comcept,"I have never read a book that was written in this fashion. Each chapter written by a different, picking up the story line after reading the prior chapters. It as a great read"
1,Dried out,This product came and dried out in a few day's use. Ordered again to give the company a 2nd chance and because it is so easy to use 'one click'.I might be nuts to trust'em but I believe in 2nd chances.
4,Narrated slide show with biography & work analysis,"This documentary presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is very detailed, competent, and comprehensive. It includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional work analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good."
1,Riddled with Typo's,"The first page of this edition kindly asks the reader to ""forgive any spelling mistakes [and]missing or extraneous characters."" This edition is riddled with errors. A sentence on page 7 reads ""I understand that Jesus in-noj$a$ commands me to turn the other cheek and to give upmyC(Jat, for sheer sufFering-'s sake; but commands me not to resiStrevil, and warns me that my obedience may entail suffering."" I strongly encourage you to buy a different edition of this book that is readable."
4,Retail Price?,"These are good glasses for the money, but Amazon lists them as $80 retail when in fact the box they come in (from Rabbit Metrokane) lists the retail price as $20 for two."
4,"I liked how the tanning lotion went on, ...","I liked how the tanning lotion went on, but the color didn't really please me. It also rubbed off on my clothes."
2,I gave this to my wife to try ...,"I gave this to my wife to try and it went on easily, but it looked more orange than brown. She'd never tried any other sunless tanning products to compare it to, so it may be due to her skin coloring. As I said above it was easy to work with, just not a good color choice for her."
4,I liked using the Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Foam ...,"I liked using the Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Foam because I didn't have to spend a lot of time rubbing the foam into my skin and it didn't turn my knees, ankles, or elbows a darker brown than the rest of the skin on my body. Within a couple of days I had a tan that my friends noticed. I will continue to use this product."
3,The Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Foam worked okay. It ...,"The Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Foam worked okay. It looked somewhat fake because it was an orange-ish color, not what a tan is supposed to look like. If you are thinking about using this product, it applies easily but it only lasts for about four days. I wouldn't use this again. I'll stick with a normal suntan and not something from a bottle."
3,I don't get along with foam tanners,I wish the color of the bronzer stayed on instead of the tan itself. The foam tanners always give me problems with drying too quickly to spread them evenly. The color is too orangy for my super pale skin. I would only use it on the face and not my entire body. It's too easy for me to get streaks despite taking all of the steps to exfoliate and moisturize before use.
4,Cool mix!,Some great music put together by todays artists. Loved it so much I bought extra copies for my friends.
4,pretty good but lacks some of the original swing finesse,"This c.d. swing collection is pretty decent, but the remakes of some of the songs aren't as impressive as the originals. Nothing beats that classic swing, but next generation swing comes pretty close."
4,still works,why can't pampers make the sensitive with special yellow to blue stripe for older babies is my only complaint.
5,Happy I found them.,We have enjoyed these diapers since he was a newborn. Can't find this size diapers where I live. So I found them online at a dynamite price plus free shipping!!!!! These diapers are leak-free diapers. Worth the little extra jingle.
5,"Great diapers, free shipping, good price....","These are the best diapers. Our daughter is a little over six months and I have not had a single leak since I started using Pampers Cruisers. I like that they have a little bit of the ""cloth-like"" feel that the Swaddlers had. The amazon price is very comparable to other places (not more but not much less either). I like that they have the free shipping, and even when using the free super saver shipping it got to our house in two days."
5,"happy mommy, happy baby","all is well when the diaper does its job, no leaks = happy baby = happy mommy.i like the size 2-3 for m 16 pound 4 month old. they are a perfect fit."
5,Satisfied Mom!,"Swaddlers are the only diapers that I use for my daughter. They are a great fit and they NEVER leak! I have been using them since we were in the hospital. I was a little afriad to order them from Amazon because of all the reviews stating that it took forever to receive the diapers, but I ordered them anyway. I selected the super saver shipping which usually takes forever since it's free, but the diapers came THREE days later!!! I assume whatever shipping problems they may have had before have been fixed. I will definitely order my diapers from them in the future!"
5,Great for Bigger Newborns!,"I LOVE these Swaddlers size 2-3! My 4 month old little guy is not-so-little, and I was sad to have to move him out of Swaddlers so soon. These size 2-3s came just in time. He will soon be in Cruisers, which are great, too, but I'm glad I could keep him in the softer diapers a little longer."
5,Still Satisfied,"We love the swaddlers diapers, and will be sad when our little one grows too big for them. Pampers is the best, most absorbent diaper brand we've tried. Also, the swaddlers are so soft, we wouldn't want to put anything else on our baby's sensitive skin. We recommend the swaddlers to all our friends with babies."
2,somehow not as good as the lower sizes,"This product is strange, and not as good as the ones we purchased from the same product line. It has little white threads-like things erected on the inner-line that apparently bothered baby's skin. My daughter has had a bad rash. Try one with little quantity (such as 40-pack) first with this product to see if it works without problem to your little one."
1,They Changed Them !,"Recent changes in the absorptive materials in the Pampers Swaddlers caused a rash on my little one's 'tushy'. Have switched to the Fisher Price brand, available at Amazon and Babies R Us. I am totally happy with the switch."
1,worst diapers,"These diapers are absolutely the worst. My 3 weeks old son was developing the rash on the third day on these daipers. We were initially thinking that it is not the diaper but some thing else, after trying several different things including religiously using the diaper rash creams we came to the conclusion that it is the diaper that is the culprit. I dont know what chemicals they are using in these diapers , but they are causing bad rash. And yes , we do change diapers very often. Hands down the worst diaper."
2,"Confusing strange text, OK pictures",The sing song prose that Ms. Turner uses is hard for a child to understand or appreciate. She trys hard to give the reader a sense of life as a shaker and she does. Maybe thats why there are no shakers left. Mr. Minor's pictures are somewhat flat and dry.
1,Cap sent not what is pictured.,"The picture shows a cap with copper contacts. The first one I ordered, I got an aluminum cap of different brand. I needed a cap so I used it. I ordered another thinking maybe they sent the wrong one the first time. But again I got the same cap, NOT Tru-Tech with copper. From now on I get my caps retail, so I can see what I pay for BEFORE I buy!These caps last about 5,000 miles before engine idles rough."
5,Great Book,I really liked this addition to the series. I agree with other reviewers who've said he could have done more to move the series forward but it didn't bother me enough to cost a star. If you like epic or military sci-fi it's a great read.
2,"Be kind to your reader, Mr. Anderson","I agree, it is a page turner but not a very good one. The story jumps from one event to the next without much cohesion. My feeling is, the author tries to get as many sequals out of this story as possible. To make this possible, he adds strange new characters. For example, mom, after having been frozen for 30 years, turns out to be an unfriendly monster, after she thaws. Help!Afterwards, I had to read for balance some of Asimov's novels, who was always kind to the reader."
4,Great series - Vol 4 best one yet!,I resisted for along time to get into this series but gave in recently and read all four volumes in a row. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of them and cannot wait for the next one. It is space opera at its very best.
3,"Story Terrific, Reader NOT","The story in this series continues to be incredible and engaging. 5 stars for the storyIn this offering, however, they changed readers. 0 stars for the reading. It seems the new reader (and director) didn't place any priority on the continuity of pronunciation. This one changed how so many names and words were pronounced that I struggled for quite a chunk of the book to figure out who was being referred to. So, if the director/producer/reader/... is reading this, try having the reader listen to the previous offerings so your repeat listeners can figure out what you are talking about. I don't care if you think the previous reader blew it. He was first, and you have to follow. That's your obligation to the listeners"
1,Terrible book and series,"This book and the series are boring, predictable, and had no characters I cared about. If you like big sweeping epics like Dune this is not the book or series for you."
3,Narration,"While I am enjoying (in process) book 4, I am wondering what happened to the wonderful George Guidall, narrator of the first 3 books. Jury still out on the current narrator but low marks for not carrying forward pronunciations of many of the Anderson characters. It is somewhat disconcerting at this point and takes some getting used to."
3,Really good book. But it was abridged and I did not know that.,I hate reading abridged books. I feel like I missed alot which I probaly did. The story itself is great. So many things going on I'm looking forward to see how it all ends.
3,ok but not great,"I have the long sicks in this scent, and love them the cones however do not smell the same and are very hard to light and keep going. I had to relight them a number of times, and the smell was just not the same. I keep on ordering the sticks because I love them so much however will stick with a different cone brand and smell which I love more. Had to try these, and they are not awful, but the are also not the Orchards and Vines perfume I love!!"
5,good all around collection,"This is a very good cd with many entertaining and different songs, but all along the folk line.Very nicely done.There are 30 songs on here and some are well known, others not so well known, but all done enjoyably."
5,Jack and the Panic Monster,"At what point does our life transition from ""normal"" to ""impaired"" and how can we take an active part in healing? Author Evelyn Barkley Stewart has approached Neal Cassidy in her ability to put herself into print and make it perfectly believable. The sudden overwhelming changes that occur in our lives follow the rule that ""our biography becomes our biology"". For anyone suffering from the debilitating problems of panic disorder this book is a must read. It is important to find the beautiful person that exists at the center of what appears to be a dysfunctional life. The emotional fabric of our body, that dictates our existence, has many rips that can easily become a rent in the garment. Returning to a functional ""normal"" life is possible if one listens to this author and actually knows her sincerity. I have experienced her wisdom and can say that I look forward to each new day with the memories of my less than perfect past."
4,Good but sometimes confusing formulas,I am using the book as one of my references in teaching Modern Physics. Derivation of equations and formulas require only basic algebra and trigonometry. A lot of equation analysis which is very helpful in understanding the equation and the implications.
3,Acceptable,"It is my textbook. It may not be the best book, but still worth to read. Acceptable book for year two university student."
2,"WAY too dumbed-down, needs more math","For a undergraduate text, I expect more mathematical explanations and modeling and less dumbed-down concepts. This book is really geared toward the lowest common denominator. The course that uses this book at my college is hands-down the ""dumbest"" class required for majors. It reads like a middle-school science textbook."
4,Fast 2 Player Action with a some stratigic thinking too,"The 2 player mode is great, you chose from 6 cool charactorseach armed with a long range weapon and a variaty of traps. you haveto trick you opponent into running into hidden bombs, mines or 4 other great traps. the one player game is the same exept you have to go up against a computer controlled opponent who is usally too easy or too tough. this game is great with two, and dull with one after you beat it a few times."
3,A good introduction to crocheting socks,"There are a few definite dislikes of the book, namely that the weight of each yarn is omitted, which makes substitutions a bit tough.The patterns in this book are a great place to start, and introduce a bunch of good options for construction/creation. Some of the patterns are a bit basic, but that's a GREAT place to start learning!The instructions are clearly written, and I have yet to notice any errors."
3,This book is not for beginners,"I am a beginner and I found this book a bit confusing. I was able to make the tube but I couldn't figure how I was suppose to shape the socks.And the illustration only showed the finished products so for someone like me couldn't really get it.After reading this book, I realized that I may need to know a little about patternmaking."
2,I was hoping for more.,"I consider myself an intermediate crocheter, by means that if I wanted to design my own sock pattern I could but I'd rather be sure and use other people's (professionals) patterns.I am really sorry for spending money on this one. Out of the 16 patterns only two are for toe-up socks. They are hard to interpret and the difference between them is not that great. They almost all, look the same until you start crocheting the leg and by then I'm sure you can find a nice stitch to use by yourself. Seriously, there are far better patterns for free out on the internet."
4,ALWAYS PLACE A STITCH MARKER IN THE LAST STITCH,"I absolutely love this book. This book is a must have for you crochet library. I have made a couple pairs of socks and they turned out wonderful.I do feel there is one bit of instruction that is left out. YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PLACE A STITCH MARKER IN THE LAST STITCH OF THE ROW YOU ARE WORKING ON(except heel). Move the marker up with each row. When you get to the *HEEL* instructions, never touch the marker.Leave in last stitch untouched until you get to the *GUSSET*. For example on page 16 under *HEEL*, sc 25 sts and leave your marker untouched until you get to the instructions for the *GUSSET*. Then they will have you place additional markers on the sides. When you get the instructions for the *FOOT* only remove side markers. Keep last stitch marker in place and move it with each row. Keep using the end of row stitch marker till the end of the project. By keeping your marker in place you sock will be alot easier. Have fun!"
2,Spillane at His Raunchiest,"I'm a big fan of Spillane's 1950's Mike Hammer series and even of his books about Tiger Mann, Morgan the Raider, Ryan the Hood. But Dogeron Kelly? What a second-stringer! I had heard ""The Erection Set"" was the Mick's most graphic novel. Whoever said that couldn't have been referring to the action in or out of bed. It's got a lot of nasty language and quips about every kind of heterosexual copulation, but the best thing I can say about it is it's very easy to pick up and put down without losing your train of thought. Actually, if you ever wanted to see Mickey's ex-wife almost totally revealed, then the cover photo is the best thing I can say about it. I bought it to take with me on an airplane trip and it served its purpose --- it was better than utter tedium."
4,Michael Stone Shows Grit,"Totally Dead by Michael Stone is a fun, fast read that has many qualities that will keep you coming back for more. The dialog is crisp and Streeter, our hero, is someone to root for and laugh with. Although the stories don't have the complexity of a Harlan Coben Novel, the are very entertaining. Streeter will remind you of Parker's Spencer but without the annoying self analysis and the over the top food descriptions. All in all, Streeter is the kind of guy you want in your corner and in your library."
1,Totally Stupid,"I hate to disagree with the other reviewers, but I found the book a big disappointment. The main character, Streeter, is almost one dimensional, the dialogue is a string of cliches, and the rest of the characters are intellectually limited and hopelessly predictable. My impression was that Streeter wasn't ""tough"", he was just too slow to know what he was up against. Perhaps the other books in the series are better, but this example guarantees that I won't bother to find out."
5,Rock-A-Billy Review,"Another cool Proper CD. Great liner notes and alot of good live cuts by Eddie while on Tour in England prior to his death. The interviews with Eddie on Disc one are pretty cool, but the real bonus here is the Eddie and Gene Vincent duet covering ""white Lightin' Disc 2 has some not so comman Eddie Cochran songs as well as a couple of really hot instrumentals. If you like Eddie Cochran this is a really good cd to add to your collection and a chance to get to know more about him. Can't wait to play some of these cuts on my show, think the listners are going to enjoy them.The Mean Eyed CatRock-A-Billy ReviewKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
4,The fragrance was clean and nice. I liked ...,The fragrance was clean and nice. I liked the way I felt clean.
5,Memory Lane,"Having grown up in Texas near the same era the book is set in, I found myself identifying with the colloquialisms and small town living. Reading the book, I anxiously turned pages wanting to uncover the secrets that drove a wedge between Juliet and her sister. I hope there is a sequel!"
4,"Not bad, for a cheap rest","I've used one of these for a few years in a variety of places.One benefit is its slim depth. I was able to use it on a work table in a lab where there was BARELY enough room for an IBM Preferred Pro slim keyboard (19K1760) and a little wrist rest. Others would've fallen off the edge. It's also a very comfortable rest (for me).After a few years, the fabric covering has begun to pull off the edge, exposing the sticky gel inside. (1 point off.)In all, for the price, this is a good wrist rest."
4,"19 inches in length, what happened to the prior 23 inchers?","I highly recommend these wrist pads, they are excellent.These are 19.0""x2.75x0.75. I want longer, 24"", but these are as long as I can find. Unlike some of the other cheaper non-US, Indian, wrist pads, leaning an elbo on them won't cause the gel to move way off to the sides, the gel is very good and adequately fixed in place while still being wonderfully soft and rubbery.I use small keyboard without the extra number keypad on the end. This allows my wrists to slide back and forth from mouse to keyboard seamlessly all day, where as separate mouse support would leave a seam/crack/space and would lock-in more of a fixed position. I recommend stacking two of these if you want your wrists to be approx straight projections from your arms."
4,To Gel or Not To Gel?,"This is not the best wrist rest.As wrist rests go, only one wrist rest must exist as best.It is billed as a ""gel"" wrist rest. As such, the reviewer must defer to the manufacturer's best judgment, because this wrist rest does list (in my case, it lists to the right). I do find that the odor emitted by the new wrist rest is not the best, but you do get used to it.Should a user get used to the wrist rest smell, though, the user used to the best flex wrist rest's existing smell is rewarded.So, to sum up, here we don't have the best right-listing flex wrist rest that exists."
1,Slippery Mat,"I bought this mat, used it once for flow yoga, then exchanged it for a Prana Eco mat.When I bought the mat I told the sales girl at the sporting goods store that I wanted a mat that wasn't slippery. This is the mat I went home with. Took it to a yoga class and as soon as my hands started to perspire I slipped all over the place. I tried flipping the mat over, thinking I was using the wrong side. The other side was as slippery as the first. After spending several minutes trying to stop slipping I finally grabbed a face towel and used that for traction under my hands for the duration of the class.I do yoga 1-2 times a week. I'm really pleased with the Prana Eco mat. It costs a few dollars more, but I do not have the slipping problem that I had with the Hugger Mugger."
1,Bad Buy,I bought this mat 5 months ago. It has been used for an Ashtanga class twice a week for 5 months and wore out! Wore a hole completely through it. The cost is such that I expected better service. A huge disapointment.
2,Quality Disappointing,"I bought this mat about 4 months ago. I did like the mat initially. However, after about 3 months of use the mat started showing wear and now little foam pieces are starting to come off the surface of the mat in the heavy use areas. I don't have much experience with yoga mats, but I did expect that it would last longer than that. I contacted the manufacturer about the problem with the mat, but they did not offer to exchange the mat."
5,Tapas-Comfort Plus,I purchased this yoga mat becauseI was looking for comfort and easeto my body while in asana poses. I'mpleased with the result and highlyrecommend this mat for those peoplewho have joint challenges!
1,"Very, very slippery when wet!","I bought this because of the extra thickness and it is thick; however, this mat gets very, very slippery with just minimal sweating. I am fairly new to yoga and I'm not doing hot, sweaty Ashtanga - we're talking basic yoga with some vinyasa. This would be unsuitable if you were a really proficient practitioner. I've had this less than a year and have tried various cleansers but nothing makes it less slippery. I'm in the market for a new mat and will try something more highly textured."
5,Best mat I've tried,"I bought this mat after I tried a friend's. I had two other mats, but they weren't very sticky, were too thin, and one smells strongly of chemicals even though I tried to let it air out over a few months. Laying on it in a yoga class actually made me feel sick.The original tapas mat is very light (even though I purchased the ""ultra""-- which is thicker than the original ""orignal""), very, very sticky and does not reek of plasticy, rubbery chemicals at all.I think it would be hard to be disappointed with this product."
3,Not everything I hoped for.,"I just got one of these mats and found it was slipery similar to the comment above.. Apparently there was some kind of oily coating from the factory. I washed it with soap and the sliperyness went away. A word of caution if you do this....this mat absorbs water and soap, so don't use too much soap and wring it out afterwards otherwise the residual soap will be just as slipery as the oily stuff you're trying to get rid of. To wring out all the soapy water, I rolled it along with a towel and put my knees on it and the towel absorbed all the soapy water.While the mat is thick, it isn't very dense. I found it didn't give me any more padding than the thinner mat I was replacing."
1,disappointed,I unfortunately received a hugger mugger tapas ultra mat that started to breakdown almost immediately. I received a second one and the same thing happened which was little tears on the surface started after only using the mat 3 times.
2,Okay mat,I bought this mat to replace my old mat which I used for 8 years before I finally lost it. I had a Hugger Mugger mat and so I thought that my new mat would hold up as well as the old one. My new mat is about a year old now and is already wearing in spots. I am disappointed overall with the quality of the product.
5,"Rutten's Masterpiece: Bas ""Big Books Of Combat""","I was amazingly impressed with Ultimate Fighting Champion Bas Rutten's, ""Big Books Of Combat"". These books are loaded with hundreds of excellent fighting and training techniques geared for the real world of combat. The mammoth volumes give a fascinating insight into how brutal yet intelligent and sophisticated the art of NHB combat really is. It will take days just to look through the hundreds of techniques Rutten has to offer. The books have helped my understanding of combat and how well rounded a fighter must be to compete in NHB competition. If you think your a tough guy and know how to fight think again after you see what Bas Rutten has to say about combat. These books are a must have addition to every martial artist fight library."
5,They Love It!,"My children love Ed Emberly drawing books. They can sit with them and draw for hours. (They are 6, 5, and 3.) My two boys, in particular, love this book. They not only make the exact drawings listed, but they adapt them and mix them into their own weird creations. Ed Emberly drawing books do not show children how to draw with words. Instead, they list step by step, shape by shape instructions. They are very easy to follow, even for non-readers."
5,7r old loves it,"My 7 yr old is a bit of a perfectionist and easily gets frustrated with his drawing abilities. But he really likes this book. It's fun for him because it's monsters and such and it shows ""how-to"" really well."
2,For older children,I bought this for my 7 year old Nephew because he likes to doodle and draw. This book was too complicated for him. He likes Ed Emberley's other book.
4,gipsy style,"great cd and to think it is only 3 musicians bass guitar and violin. Hope to find others in this style, I guess they broke up since I can't find any other cds by same artist. if you get a chance pick this cd up"
5,Let Diet be Your Medicine!,"As a lifelong asthma sufferer and an Ehlers-Danlos Patient, I was told my prognosis was poor. The drugs were destroying my body and yet were no longer relieving the problems. When my daughter starting suffering herself, I found this book...and now our whole approach to healing is thru diet and supplementation. Within a year, both of us are better than the doctors could have imagined. This book has paid for itself hundreds of times over, in the lack of doctor visits and medicne co-pays alone!"
4,Please read this review,"There is significant evidence that the root cause of many, if not most, cases of asthma (and many allergies as well) is deficiency of magnesium. This fact is discussed in detail by Dr. Carolyn Dean in her excellent book The Miracle of Magnesium. Dr. Dean recommends 600 mg of supplemental magnesium daily. People with asthma who follow Dr. Dean's advice about daily magnesium supplementation often improve dramatically even if they have continued to struggle with asthma under other treatments which omit magnesium supplementation. If you are suffering from asthma please read Dr. Dean's excellent book and follow her advice regarding daily magnesium supplementation. It may well be the most important thing you will ever due to relieve this terrible ailment. By the way, although a variety of magnesium supplements are available, and beneficial, chelated magnesium -- which is readily available in most health food stores -- is the most effective."
2,Asthmatics- this is not the solution,"I read Richard Firsheins book with much interest. Yes, it is well written and contains factual information but I found my asthma was as bad after reading it as it was before. The book did little to improve my condition - it did not reverse it.In all my search- only one book solved my problem- it is called Asthma Free naturally by Patrick McKeown and it does what it says it will do. It teaches readers how to correct their overbreathing based on the work of Russian respiratory professor Konstantin Buteyko. This book is a real gem and should be made mandatory reading for all asthmatics."
3,Misleading picture,"There is no magnet in the Pack of the advertised picture ""Why do I have to get married?"" Otherwise magnets are cute and funny, but if you're buying because of the advertised picture, don't."
1,Watery,Perhaps this product was frozen at some time; as it is very watery. Or the age ofthe product has destroyed its content.
3,too old?,The product may be too old. It was very runny and leaked all over. Not like the one I have had so I'm disappointed although I will use it. Too bad!
4,Good adjunct to The Little Red Hen,This video plays the story of the title twice. One time there are subtitles and the other not. The action takes place mostly with cartoons although there are some beautiful shots of farms and country scenes. The story is quite similar to the Little Red Hen. All the barnyard animals are there and each has an excuse whose last word rhymes with its name. I use this video with beginning ESL students after reading and discussing The Little Red Hen. We talk about the similarities and differences between the stories. We also discuss the pictures and rhymes. It has never failed to delight.
5,Awesome book!,"This book is amazing! The tricks and tips are so much fun to try out, and some of the stuff in here is just unbelievably amazing! I absolutely love Photoshop, and it is so much fun learning how to do cool new things to amaze your friends! The projects in here are so creative. And the book also comes with a CD so you can try out the projects described in the book. Excellent book!!!"
5,Igniting Purchase,This product was bought as a gift for a bright 16 year old girl. It was purchased to fuel her interest in PhotoShop without her having to first wade through a ton of dry how to. This book allowed her to see what was possible so that she now seeks out the ways that she can do other more mundane applications of the program. It provided what it was purchase for. A match for a creative fire.
5,A Must Have Book,"A great comprehensive book about the skills required to safely Sea Kayak in just about any conditions. Well written, easy to follow explanations and pictures on the skills of rescues, rolling, strokes, ""reading"" the water and Weather, essential equipment....basically everything every kayaker needs to be safe on the water.Novices and experienced kayakers will find valuable information in this book. Read through it in a few hours and can't wait to get out and practice!!"
5,Step-by-step descriptions of real-life scenarios,"John Lull's Sea Kayaking Safety & Rescue is a ""user friendly"", comprehensive manual on how to kayak safely in a variety of sea environments. Offering step-by-step descriptions of real-life scenarios and numerous illustrations of key kayaking techniques, readers will learn how to competently assess kayaking risks, learn effective assisted self-rescues, develop group kayaking strategies, read weather patterns and currents, negotiate surf and ocean rock gardens, and deal with boat traffic. Highly recommended for personal and community library reference collections, Sea Kayaking Safety & Rescue is essential, ""must"" reading for the novice, and has a wealth of practical information to enhance safety and success for even the more experienced kayaking enthusiast."
4,"Short, quick ideas for everyday problems","Lots and lots of very specific ideas for disipline and behavior issues. Short sections easy to refer to when you need a quick idea. Covers everything from Potty training to Bedtime to Manners to Friends. Another great book like this one is: Perfect Parenting, The Dictionary of 1000 Parenting Tips by Elizabeth Pantley"
4,A Fabulous First Book,"Jane Stanton Hitchcock's first mystery Trick of the Eye was a wonderful discovery. Her writing is fresh and descriptive and in the imagination department her cup runeth over.The plot, while seemly simple, is filled with elegant twists and turns. This is the story about an artist who paint's trompe l'oeils (paintings that are made to look as if they are real - a 3-d image that tricks the idea into believing it exists)and is called upon by a wealthy, eccentric woman to recreate her now deceased daughter's coming out ball upon the walls of the ballroom where the party was held.She brings her up to her estate and keeps her there while she is working on the piece and entertains her with stories from the past. The artist becomes enmeshed when she discovers she is the spitting image of the woman's dead daughter and tries to discover who killed her.All in all a wonderfully woven tapestry of characters, writing, plot and images."
5,Rapture of Trompe L'oeil,"One of the greatest mysteries ever written, Trick of the Eye entrances the mind and roils the heart with its Trojan tracery of cues and colors that lead the reader, step by quickening step, down an aphoristic path of sumptuous literary pleasures to a rapturous ambush at the end both shocking and inevitable."
4,The wealthy ARE different...,"This book first appealled to me, an almost old woman, since the main character, Faith, is no longer young. Well written descriptions of Faith's changing perception draw one into the mystery. The solution and the ending are tart,yet satisfying. On a deeper level,it serves as a grim reminder that your life is what you choose to make of it. Read the dedication after you finish the novel. I hope to read more from this writer, & would like to know more about her."
2,Meh,"I found this contrived and unconvincing. I was particularly disappointed in her depiction of the milieu of the truly wealthy -- since it's a world she grew up in, I expected something more visceral -- but I also didn't care for the characters, and the plot... well, contrived and unconvincing."
5,Love this author...another hit!,"I've read all of her books and this did not disappoint...an added twist at the end really threw for a loop! I love the mix of an affair, mystery, cultural references and art! Great summer beach read."
2,Did Not Live Up to the Hype,"I had trouble putting down this book each evening. Although the writing is mediocre and the descriptive passages are too long and obviously padded, I was propelled by the misguided expectation that the solution to the mystery would be logical and satisfying, neither of which is true. The disappointing revelation of the identity of the murderer is almost an afterthought, the unlikely relationship between the protagonists is nonsensical, and the ethical decision forced upon Faith is the stuff of romance novels. A sensible person would have made another choice. A Trick of the Eye was a disappointment, since I invested considerable effort in searching for it on the Internet, having been inspired by Diane Rehm's interview with its interesting author."
1,Very disappointing...,"Because I loved Social Crimes, I purchased this book and was looking forward to an excellent tale. Oh my! How disappointing. I figured out it was a ""first book"" right away, but even allowing for that, the dialogue was stilted, the characters were poorly developed, and the ending was awful. The unfortunate result was a terrible waste of paper which should have remained in the hard drive and spared all of us Jane Stanton Hitchcock fans! Thankfully, she improved immensely as a writer and I whole-heartedly recommend her subsequent books. Save your money and purchase one of those!"
5,Good job,My wife and I went on this train ride so we were pleasantly surprised by this slides how for our grandson
3,A fine foundation for a brilliant career.,"I have found that initial recording efforts from well known metal bands can reveal their true direction. ""Rocka Rolla"" exposes Judas Priest's depth and conviction to their musical genre. The song ""Run Of The Mill"" emphatically drives this point home. My Priest collection would not be complete without this disc."
3,Greatness starts somewhere!,"First of all, don't believe it when someone says ""Rocka Rolla"" sounds nothing like Judas Priest. It does. It sounds like Judas Priest sounded AT THAT TIME. Rob Halford's vocals are instantly recognisable and the two-guitar team of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton are there from the outset.It does reflect its era, though, and listening to this you get a bit of Black Sabbath, Jimi Hendrix, Uriah Heep, Deep Purple and Cream - but what's wrong with that?One amusing aside is our Halfie's take on male/female relationships in ""Rocka Rolla"" and ""Cheater"". Gotta give the guy credit for trying.I'd draw some direct comparisons with the Scorpions' ""Lonesome Crow"" and the first Black Sabbath album.In retrospect, I'd rather listen to this than ""Turbo"" (their lowest point) any day!"
2,Mediocre,"The first Judas Priest album is utterly mediocre. While not exceedingly bad, it's not particularly goold either. This is for curious diehards only. I listen to it when I first got it and haven't listened to it since. The band would improve greatly with their next release, Sad Wings of Destiny."
4,Great product!,"This is a great product! It is easy to use, fast and very easy to clean. The only problem is, it is a little small (really a mini chopper!). This product is very convenient for small jobs. I think T-fal should make more products available in the US!"
5,Awsome tool,"Perfect for cutting tile. Will never go back to a wet saw. Plenty of power for grinding. Wear your safety glasses. Very comfortable to use. Wish it came with a storage case and accessories, tile saw guard can be difficult to find."
2,"Great original ideas, but they don't work too well.","I liked the story of Kartia, but the battles were horrendous. Not only were they long, but they constant making of creatures made me feel like I was watching someone act out Magic: The Gathering. If you play for stories, and ONLY stories, try this game. If you play for only fighting...run away screaming. If you play for a mix, they game will be fun...at first."
1,You can get more excitement from a box of cheerios,"I thought that this game may have been cool, and going into it with an open mind I was very disappointed. It dull and boring and it's not even close to an RPG, or even a decent war simulation. The story lacks, the graphics lack, the music lacks - there's nothing redemable about this entire game! If you want to waste your money, try burning it first - it'd be more fun."
1,it would be a zero... but one is as low as it goes,"i bought this stupid game because i had extra money on a credit to the store , this is the worst game i have played. the graphics are horrible, you dont walk around, it is a story and all you do is encounter weak enemies called phantoms and people, , dont get it"
4,new depths to old stories,"TALES OF PSYCHOLOGY: Stories to Make You Wise is an idiosyncratic anthology of complex literary fragments about our darker emotions. Some authors allow for redemption, others do not. Dr. Bond's observations & comments offer us glimpses of both the history of psychology, & aspects of the stories we might not have noticed.An interesting collection of thoughts."
5,Nineteen intellectually and literarily gifted authors,"Painstakingly compiled by psychoanalyst Alma H. Bond (who was in private practice for 37 years), Tales Of Psychology: Short Stories To Make You Wise is an impressive anthology of short stories which were specifically crafted by their authors to provide meaningful insights into the nature and workings of the human mind. Ranging from Raymond Carver's ""A Small, Good Thing"", to Woody Allen's ""My Apology"", nineteen intellectually and literarily gifted authors proffer their short story revelations into the human psyche in a compelling, highly readable, enthusiastically recommended collection."
5,Living end is great,Anybody who compares these guys to green day or offspring should be (...). There is not a band I have heard that even compares to the living end. This album shows how diverse a rock band can be. From the Stray cats to The Clash to The Police and adding their own special ingredient mixing it all into a blender. It's all amazing I just wish they would have stuck with this style. Instead of simplifing there sound. Anyway they were on hbo's reverb not too long ago they were great.
3,Cali,I like Moonshine Bandits and think they are getting better with each release. Some good tracks on here but not my favorite of their releases.
1,DOES NOT CONTAIN THE LONG VERSION OF HANG ON SLOOPY,"The long version which runs over 4 minutes and has a couple of different verses added to the song is the BEST especially in stereo. A McCoys CD was released in the late 90`s that contained that track. If there`s going to be an anthology, that long version is extremely important in my opinion especially for the McCoys purist."
2,Too many boring airport scenes!,"This video attempts to show kids what an airplane trip will be like, but features too many boring shots of the inside of the airport and not many interesting ones. For a better video, try ""The Big Plane Trip"" which covers the same material but in a much more viewable way."
2,A Classic Along The Lines Of Song Of The South,"Oh, wow, lovely tales about an upright English judge overseeing those amusing simpleton Irish, a people just too darn backward and wee slow-minded to oversee their own affairs... As an Irish citizen, I find this book offensive in the same way such one-time ethnic classics as Song of the South are now seen as offensive."
1,Not The Hits of '67,"These are not the hits of 1967. These are re-recorded and not always by the original artists. If you want the real thing, don't waste your money here! If you are as familiar with these songs as I am, then every different note will jar your nerves just as they do mine. These recordings are simpy fakes, forged perhaps by some of the original musicians, but not the same sound. The fine print on the label reads: ""This album may contain re-recorded tracks by the original artists. Tracks featuring groups may not include all the original members."" Folks, every track features a group, and there are no two ways about it-these are not the hits of '67."
4,Good!,As all of L.J. Smith's books this one is great!! It isn't her best one... but man it is still good.
2,Captain Streeter Pioneer,"This biography/autobiography has led local historians astray ever since 1913! Streeter wanted one kind of book, and his collaborator wanted another, and they reached a compromise only after Streeter stopped publication. As a result, there is an interesting account of his Michigan boyhood, lies about his early manhood out West and in the Civil War, and wonderful whoppers about his years fighting over ownership of Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Streeter was a con-man, forger, and colorful mythmaker. Read it for entertainment, but not for history."
4,Great book for grandma's and grandchildren!,"How big is love? Author and illustrator, Shirley Hillard tells us simply and wonderfully in One Big Hug. Love is bigger than 2 bugs in a rug, 16 bears wearing a yellow coat, 27 chickens sitting on a goat, or even 100 penguins dancing on a cloud (you get the idea). It is enough when love is one big hug.One Big Hug is a grandmother's expression of love for her grandson. What is so nice is that all grandmothers can substitute the child's name in the book for their own grandchild's name to personalize the story.The illustrations are big, bold, colorful and whimsical. They are sure to delight the children and help draw them into the story which is really an expression of love.Armchair Interviews says: Grandparents will want One Big Hug to read to their special ones. I know I'm looking forward to reading it to mine."
3,"Poor color match, extra holes for ""snap fastener system""","Had higher expectations for this product for use in my 2007 Ford F150.I specified my model, make, and year and had hoped the carpet would be better color matched. Seems to be a generic beige color which somewhat matched my carpet but you can clearly tell it is a not color matched.Also, the pictures don't show the extra holes that are in the mat to use what the call a ""snap fastener system"" to stop the carpets from sliding. Essentially it appears to be a wide, nylon screw which is supposed to crew into your truck's carpet and then protrude thru the mat via one of the holes. Once thru you put a little plastic cap over it. There is no way the nylon scew was going to make it into my carpet. I don't care to have the plastic caps on top of the carpet.Overall - disappointed. If I would have seen these mats in person I would not have purchased them. They'll do but I should have shopped more carefully."
1,A Humongous Bore!,"i really shake my head and wonder how on earth this was published. weak, weak stuff."
3,Slow Down!!!!!,"I didn't get a chance to really enjoy the Step and Sweat workout because the instructor moved through the moves so fast. Not being able to follow the instructor was very frustrating. I about wanted to give up on the whole ordeal. Plus, the workout group looked to fake for my taste. If step aerobics is not something you do all the time, I recommend another tape. I didn't even bother with the Fat Blaster because it is supposed to be at a higher tempo. Recommended for more advanced steppers."
5,Good Stuff!,"The ""Fat Blaster"" portion is the winner here. Kendell's cueing is great. He is a professional, well-conditioned instructor with apparent knowledge of physiology and fitness training. The combinations are challenging and the level of workout is excellent. The live drums add a special zing to the workout and keep you moving. I've lost weight and gained muscle using this video. I love the energy and focus. This is a spiffy, bright, professional and tightly produced product that will perform. It is easy to use this video several times per week. Get it, use it, love it!"
5,"Extreme fun, great music, wonderful instructor!","I love the first Fat Blaster-the next step workout! Kendall exudes infectious energy and motivation, the live drum music is better than any other music I have heard in a step/aerobic video-it really gets you moving, and the large class really seems to be having a blast and even adds their own unique style to the moves. This was soo much fun-I highly recommend it! I was very impressed, the only downfall, -it was too short and the second workout on the DVD-Step and Sweat was quite boring in comparison."
3,Too Dancey,"I found these step routines too bouncy. I also found that there was far too much preparation needed to finish just one routine. It is not self explanatory nor is it easy to get to a level where the workout is simple. I would reccomend instead, Keli Roberts, or one of the regular Step Aerobics series."
1,Choreography DIFFICULT,"The choreography of both workouts on this DVD is much too difficult. Even after a few run-throughs, I still don't have either one down and now am giving up on them. I don't get a good cardio workout on either one due to trying to pick up all the cutesy little steps, plus since they're step workouts, I'm afraid I will fall off and crack my head open on the TV. Save your money."
4,Buy it for Kendall,"Quick and to the point, Kendall's workout routing is a winning combo with lots of fun. It is not very challenging from a aerobic stand point, but it is perfect for beginners and for medium/advanced looking for a littler, fun workout for those light days. Love the music the routine is set to.The other routine is just old fashioned and weird, but give it a try, you may like it."
3,"Fat Blaster is fun, Step and Sweat is not so great","The first video on the dvd ""Fat Blaster"" is a lot of fun and a great workout, I just wish it was longer. If you're trying to burn some calories in a quick session this is a great choice. It's a fast paced routine and the music is live drums which is fun. Step and Sweat, the second video, is not a very good workout, some of the moves are awkward and overly complicated, and in general it's just boring. I don't regret buying the video because I like the first workout enough that it makes up for the second one."
1,Over-rated!,"Don't buy this dvd unless you are looking for an unfulfilling dance party. First of all, there is so much going on in the background of ""Kendall's"" portion of the workout, that you can't even focus on what you are supposed to be doing...which is just as frustrating. I thought this was going to be a STEP workout. I have been taking step classes for several years, and have never been so unsatisfied with a workout. The same goes for the other half of the video. The instructor is terrible at calling out cues, and once again, nothing but dance moves. I didn't buy this to learn how to do the mamba. I hardly broke a sweat with this video, and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a serious step workout."
2,to slow and to complicated,"The first workout on this dvd was for first time steppers and the second workout was for very experienced steppers, so for those who are in between newby and novice it was either too slow or too complicated."
5,Upbeat exercise,This DVD is excellent if you like upbeat music and a good sweat. The moves are easy to learn and follow. You will get a good work out in 30 minutes. You can do this workout high impact or low impact. It's a fun way to exercise.
2,Too Slow,"I am not interested in learning salsa or mambo or any other cutesy steps during my workout. (Especially since I am latina and know it a lot better than these people could ever try.) I just want to work out. I find this work out slow and the faces the back girls make annoying. He has some good routines which are interrupted by slow salsa or mambo moves. UNNECESSARY!I didn't even finish the other work out. Again, if I want to take a dance class, I'll go to the studio. I want to sweat!If you like cutesy slow moves and like to see girls pretending to have fun, order this video. For sweating and getting your heart rate up, keep looking."
5,Great intermidiate option,this DVD has 2 30 min segments that are very solid and fun. Nice and interesting routines. They are my fall back when I'm a bit pressed for time. My main probelem is that they aren't chalanging enough - I've had to add hight to me step to realy work with these. They are great for begginer to intermidiate - especially if you never stepped before since in the step and sweat section she builds you in to the basic moves and then tells you there name. Another problem is that this is just to much breaking down - since I do the same thing again and again I would rather have a little problem at the start then be realy boared in 3-4 sessions.
2,Who needs a step for this?,"I didn't care for this dvd at all, the first workout hardly used the step, it was mostly marching. It was not much of a cardio workout. Also some of the moves were hard to follow, and I'm not an amateur. The second workout is just as bad, especially since one of the girls [rear] is hanging out of her shorts. It also concentrates on dancing too much, not enough step..."
3,Nice Book-But it's Complicated,"This book is beautiful,fun to read, and contains quality recipes; however, it is not user friendly. First, you need to be sure you can find the hard-to-find ingredients. If there's not a Mexican grocery store or specialty store in your area, you will not find the required ingredients. Next, a lot of the recipes are just too complicated. I love to cook and I don't mind spending a reasonable amount of time doing it. The main dish recipes in this book, however, are too complicated. The salsa recipes, on the other hand, are great. If you're an expert cook who is familiar with authentic Mexican cuisine, and you have access to the ingredients, then you'll find this book useful. All other cooks may want to look at a copy before actually purchasing it."
4,Que Bueno for Bayless,Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen cookbook is chock full of fabulous recipes that are easy to prepare with step-by-step instructions accompanied by mouth-watering pictures. It is clear that the author has experience with mexican dishes. His commentary is insightful with a touch of humor. I recommend the book for anyone interested in the culinary delights of the Southland.
3,Pretty good but....,...the writing style is pretty chatty and the recipes are often original rather than traditional. This may be what you prefer.
2,Error I counted the number of pages. There are 17 pages,"In 1969 the original version was 3 or 4 pages. A fewyears back a psychologist working on her Ph.D thesisusing the Racial Attitude Test expanded it to 17 pagesand included the Racial Attitude Test with her CulturalDiversity Survey. She promised test results and nevergave them to us for creating a manual. So one needsto test a population to get the proper statistics.A number of psychologists have used this test. Butthey don't want to reveal their results. I believe theirresults may show racism and are afraid of bad publicityfor their organization.If anyone just gets one with 3 pages, contact us at Nova Media Inc. with our address listed in books in print and I will sendthem the 17 page right one."
5,Ride Aboard This Tug - Bring the Kids,"My two-year-old son and five-year-old daughter love this video and so do their father and I! The footage of boats, cranes and heavy equipment is fantastic. The video puts you right inside the world of the tug captains, crane operarators and longshoremen and shows you how things work that you never thought about before - things like how new cars get from the overseas assembly line to the local dealer. Surprisingly entertaining."
1,A Good Buy?,Don't bother with this book unless you want to read a novel worthy of a daytime soap opera. There's nothing but melodrama here. The characters' cookie cutter emotions end up reassuring readers rather than transporting them to a place where they stand to gain a deeper understanding of human life and its complexities.
5,I love this thing!,"Perhaps I'm not as savvy as most of the reviewers, but I had trouble with the software. I didn't think it was as straightforward as some others did, and there are no written instructions on how to transfer music from CDs to the player. For example, it was not plain for all to see that you can download the music so that you have different levels of quality.However, once I figured it out, downloading went quickly. The ear buds are awful, so I am using the earphones from my portable CD player (which won't be used very much anymore). And, even with the full 2 hours of music downloaded, it still sounds great. I love the fact that I have 2 hours of music without having to lug a CD wallet with me, and that I can change tunes pretty quickly. The additional memory is my next purchase.This is a terrific product, and shop-intel (where I got mine) is offering it at a great price. Amazon's price is on a par with other vendors' prices."
5,Personal Audio Player is jammin and easy to use!,"I bought my personal audio player on shop-intel.com last week. They are phasing out the division that makes them so you can get some great deals on them now. I got mine for 89.95 - free shipping.After I opened the box it took me 3-4 minutes to get everything up and running. I already had the software installed (downloaded from intel.com)so i just plugged in the USB cable, and presto! I was listening to songs like that. The earphones were very uncomfortable, just like was mentioned on here, so I bought some sony excercise earphones which make it a complete package.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an mp3 player. Its small, has good memory, and even after bouncing on a trampoline with it, it didn't fall off my belt."
4,"Good, but incomplete","This player is good for my gardening job because it was light and didn't get in my way. My main complaint is that despite the claim that it could hold over 2 hours of music, I only got about and hour and seven minutes with the base 64 mb of memory filled up. Because of this, I'm going to have to buy a memory expansion card (another 50 or so bucks). You don't want to use the included ear buds for a long time either, as they make your ears hurt after a while."
4,Good Player for athletes,"I really like this player. It does not have the features that the technoYepp my brother has, but i do not need them. #1, it has no FM tuner. I live in the boonies, and couldnt pick up a signal anyway #2,doesnt show song title, etc. This also doenst bother me, I know what I downloaded #3 no voice recording capabilities like some higher end models. Again, I would not use this feature anyway.I use my player for entertainment while I run or lift weights. it has excellent sound, is fairly simple to use and is compatible w/ XP, stores enough music for me to run 7 miles without listening to the same songs (even without memory card) and doesnt seem to be HORRIBLE with the batteries. why didnt I give it 5 stars? the headphones are the most uncomfortable things I have ever put in my ears.No kidding. good sound, but they are huge and uncomfortable. Overall, great player for the [money]"
4,This is a solid player!,"This is my first mp3 player, and so far I'm impressed with it. I read quite a few reviews on this player, and they were right. Great sound, when you buy another pair of headphones. The buttons could be a little easier to push, but that could make it less durable, so no big deal. No backlit lcd, this doesn't bother me at the price. Intel's manager software was a snap to install and begin using. Click and drag baby! This player makes all the others seem very overpriced."
5,Miles ahead with PAP3000,"I am an endurance athlete, and my Intel Audio player has joined me for hundreds of miles on trails, roads, trainers, and gyms. I am very pleased with the performance, durability, ruggedness, and easy of use. When compared to many other MP3 players, this was by far the most robust. I clip it to my waistband and onward I go. The life expectancy of most of my running radios are less than a year, so I was nervous about the investment. A typical failuer is the headphone jack, or getting wet, or dropped too many times. For well over a year, training for 4 marathons and an Ironman, it has stood all the punhishment I can deliver it.ProsRobust DesignSimple OperationGreat SoundBattery LifeConsButtons, can be tough, but robustOverall, if you want an MP3 player capable of keeping up with an active lifestyle. This is a great choice."
4,PAP3k,"This is a great player. I installed a 64k MMCard soon after purchasing the unit. I usually get about 160 min. of music on the player. It works great for mountain biking, snowboarding and hiking. No skips, the buttons work well, player buttons are thoughtfully placed and the software package is adequate but could use an upgrade. The headphones are cheesy and work best when not moving around much. Compared with the Rio and Nike players, it is a large step above. I highly recommend this player."
5,Great little player!,"This is a great player! Easy to use, great for the gym and it is expandable. For a basic MP3 player...what more could you want?I definitely recommend this player!"
4,A very cool toy,"This digital audio player is great. Very easy to learn software which helps you transfer songs quickly to your player and rip cd's on to your computer. Very light in weight so you don't look like an idiot with a huge cd player or walkman on your hip when you're walking or what not.Downsides to this - No AC adapter, only gives you 64 megabytes of memory, but this can be upgraded, so basically - you can only fit about 1 cd of songs on this when you first get it. And lastly, there is no way to play the songs on a car stereo. Unless of course you get a car stereo adapter tape. So that is why I gave it four stars. If you're looking for a digital audio player, I would give this one a try - it's great."
5,Chasing God by Shirley Cunningham,"I found this book at the Mesa AZ library and I am so glad I did. This book was so inspiring to me it was like it was part of my own history. I grew up in Bloomfield Hills, MI, I wanted to be a Sister when I was younger. As I read this book I got the chills sometimes, what an amazing Journey. What I learned in my almost 60 years is you don't need to chase GOD, he and all his magnificents is always with us. All we need to do is ask him into our hearts.I found this book insiteful, amazing, loving, caring,and spiritual. I would never get tired of reading this book. I do hope this amazing Author will write another book and continue her journeys."
5,Score,"Exactly what it was advertised to be. Easy to install. Would have purchased at the store but they didn't carry this size. It was replacing one I bought at the store a year ago. Hope it lasts longer, but was exactly what it said, arrived early, and I like it."
5,worked out great,I purchased the Igloo for my sisters dogs and bought the door to help block out the wind and cold. It fits great and seems to work by keeping out the wind. The order arrived quickly without any problems.
2,Wish it were removable...,"I want to put this on the doghouse to block wind during the winter, but it is not removable. I think it would make the doghouse too warm in the summer. I gave the dog extra insulation to help keep her warm, and a heating pad. I also tried to angle the house so that the wind doesn't blow straight inside. Really wish this could be taken off and put back on without permanent damage."
1,Door fits poorly.,"I bought 2 extra large doors for my 2 extra large igloos. The door size is about 2"" too small on the sides. The purpose of buying the doors was to keep the drafts and elements out. Considering there are drainage holes in the bottom of the igloos for drainage and at the top for ventilation , the doors probably won't do much to make my dogs more comfortable. I feel like I wasted my money."
1,Meh....,"this product makes my dog very skeptical of the house it is on. doesn't seem to help too much with the temperture since it does not close all the way on the house. a better idea is to place dog house opening away from wind direction and you should have the same concept. may be a good product for those that have dogs already comfortable with dog house, just didn't work for me."
1,terrible product,This product is one of the worst that I have ever purchased.They send you a flimsy plastic door with NO directions. They don't even tell you that you have to drill your own holes......terrible product.
2,Instead of the door,"Medium Dogloo is a great Catloo! This will work for cat & a little dog: put the outdoor rubber rug on top of the entrance of Indigo home, sides of the rug hanging to the ground, or to the floor (rubber side-up, carppet side-down). It's not too beautiful, but very functional, even better than the door. It'll extend the home and protect the pet from the rain, snow and wind."
3,it was okay,"Not quite large enough - but good to keep wind out.This is a good buy, but measure the opening - which I didn't do."
2,not for hyper dogs,"This cover is not for hyper dogs who go in and out of the igloo. Either that or the cover does not stand up to the elements, winds or snow blowing through. Also how its snapped onto the igloo does not last long. Mines ended up being torn up and had to remove it. The dogs seem to enjoy it though because it blocks alot of wind. However I felt in there a couple of times and it was still a little chill, even with a heated blanket. But that is for the igloo review. Maybe something made of more dog-resistant material or better snaps would make this a much better product."
3,Dog house door,"This Petmate Indigo Dog House Door does not fit the dog house very well. Leaves about 2"" at the bottom exposed/open. It's better than no door at all, but could fit a little better."
3,"Impossible to install as touted, holding up okay so far.","I taped this as installing was impossible, perhaps due to worn out old hands. So far it's held up in 30 mph winds. Better than nothing, but not as easily installed as advertised."
3,Nice color but too big,"Even though the color is nice and the wrap is interesting, the fact that the size is bigger than expected send this item to the not_very_easy_to_use section of the closet. May be the one size smaller would be better."
4,Very Good,"I agree with the only other reviewer, it's hard to find good Goddess meditation.This is a decent one, very soothing and calm.There is very little to no music which I didn't like.I found Mary's voice to be gentle and the flow was good, but if I'm not careful I can easily tune her out and go off on my own little journey.I like to use the 30 min. relaxation on my lunch break for a quick pick me up. The grounding meditation is good, but far too short, as is the inner sanctuary one."
4,Robert Johnson's first book is beautiful and well written,"Mr. Johnson has very interesting philisophical views about painting, and the book has many close up color pictures of his color and brushstroke technique. There are no step by step demonstrations, and technical application goes the classical painting approach with emphasis on drawing skills. Many good tips and insight, but more of a theory book than application in my opinion. I have one of his videos, and find this much more helpful in application. He is a very pleasant man and talented painter."
5,Wonderful book,"The book has numerous full color pictures of Mr. Johnson's paintings. He goes into a lot of detail about being a painter, what it means, the work and studies involved, etc. There are closeups of his painting strokes so we can see exactly how he paints. I bought the book from Amazon and will read and reread it endlessly."
5,A great place to start,"The main benifit of the Pimsleur program is that it teaches the correct accent and pronounciation. If you start with Pimsleur, everything else that you do will be easier. The downside, is that 90 lessons are not enough. I finished all 90 and wished I could have gone on for much longer. The voice actors are great."
1,Poor quality thriller,"Also known as The Curse of Simba (no joke) and Lion Man, the Curse of the Voodoo is ridiculously worthless dreck that wouldn't scare my grandmother. While in Africa, big-game hunter Mike Stacey nabs himself a lion only to discover that a local tribe worships them as gods who immediately - yep, you guessed it - curse Stacey but good. (Isn't that always the way?) Anywho, it's not long before the creepy ""going's on"" begin, the only problem being that none of them are actually creepy. Apparently the tribal folk have cursed our hero with the flu or some such ailment, as he spends a large part of the movie wracked with feverish sweats. (If only it were dysentery). Pure nonsense and obviously not produced by Hammer, the studio responsible for the best of sixties British, fright-fests. The ignorant and arguably racist treatment of the African natives is particularly ugly. Avoid this flick at all costs, or you'll suffer the dreaded Curse of the Boredom."
4,awesome,"I think this game is very fun. one problem is that sometimes when you have many stones in a hole, they can overflow. Please note that you can play this with three in a hole to start too."
5,Game in a Tin Missing the Tin,"People have told me they love the extra durability of the metal storage tin for this Mancala game, so I recently ordered this specific version from Amazon. I ordered this from the Are You Game merchant, expecting it to come in the metal tin as described. The version they currently stock does NOT come in the metal tin. It comes in a cardboard cover. If you are looking for the metal cover, I recommend double checking what they have in stock before hand."
5,Mancala is a great game!,"My friend got this game for her birthday and we play it everyday! This game has never gotten boring and the medal case is very durable. Glass stones come with it and they aren't too small or too big. It's a great game and I would recomend this one for younger kids. Now I wish it was in stock so I could get it, too!"
5,Strategic Feast,"My niece learned to play this game in school and wanted one for home so we got her one. I learned to play with her and she beat me many times. I could actually see her thinking through her strategy before she won. I bought one also, to learn about what it takes to win. We now have Mancala challenges that last for hours and it has become a great family game. The other great thing is we don't have to stay in the house to play. I highly recommend it. Very easy to learn."
1,"Great Game, not a great board","We love Mancala, but this board is not worth the money. Each nest only holds 4-6 stones and makes it difficult to play the game as it is intended. You would be better off finding rocks and playing with an egg carton, which would be deep enough."
2,Great game - disappointed with contents.,"We did not buy the game from amazon, but felt the need to leave a review.My 8 year old loves playing this. We brought it for him as a Christmas present this past year. After opening the package to find that there were no ""gems"" but rocks for game pieces inside I was a very disappointed. The box and instructions clearly show and state gems. You can still play the game as intended thou I guess."
3,Misleading Product Description,"I've had several of these games -- growing up and raising my own kids. It is a good game for all ages. This version is nice because it folds up to about the size of a hard cover book.However, the Amazon site touts the metal sleeve -- the version I was sent is in a cardboard sleeve. Also be advised that the stones are stored in the cups when folded, this version is too small for all the stones to be stored in a bag and then contained within. The wood exterior would benefit from buffing with fine steel wool to smooth the finish.Over all worth the price I paid."
3,Needs rework!,"This game needs some maintenance before using:1. Surface sanding, the surface is rough / roh wood2. Glas pebbles have to be replaced, they are too big. With such big pebbles you cannot play the game properly, I recommand half the size stones.I sanded the game board and replaced the glas things with little stones I collected last vacation on the beach and it made the finest Mancala ! After all a game with a very personal touch!I guess for the low price you cannot expect a better quality."
2,Don't be fooled,"I purchased this item after reading the description, which stated""Includes 48 colorful glass beads"" when I received the wood Mancala there where no ""colorful"" glass beads instead clear glass beads. I was very disappointed because the colorful beads are one of the reasons why I purchased this item.Oh and the contrary to the picture there is no metal case :-("
3,"good, but glass marbles are too big for the pods.","I purchased the boards for a game club. It serves its purpose, but it came with only enough glass beads to play 4 bead level. We have combined some of the glass beads so the kids can play up to the 6 level (the highest). For the other boards we use dried chick peas or kidney beans to play."
3,"Hot, But","I have a small apt. with a programmable thermostat and the temperature inside will vary from 70-56F. So even though I only have a 10gal tank for a leopard gecko I needed to be sure it would stay warm enough. So I Bought this 200W ceramic heater and a thermostat to control it.When I got the ceramic element I heard some stuff rattling around inside the hollow cone. I hooked it up and everything went well for a while. Then it burned out after about 2 months.My guess is that it was cycling too much, but who knows. I'm currently running a 150W ceramic element of a different brand (the tube and disk style) that I got at a local store, 2 months and counting..."
5,Where to buy,This book can be purcahsed from Steven F Austin State University for about 50 dollars. Their number is 936-468-2011. Hope this helps.
2,are there any better sounding recordings of this cd?,"well the price is right ,the song list is great,the peformance is good,but the sound of the recording is bad?well i know punk rock isnt supposed to be technical but it would help to presurve sids memory if the sound was cleaned up.sounds like a tape made from the audience.so unless you are a sid collector i would suggest tring a different cd."
4,WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ???,"You're right, the recording is lousy and Sid is so messed up he can't remember the words and when he does he slurs through most of the songs...THAT'S whats so great about it... this is Sid Vicious, what did you expect? He is the patron saint for not giving a f*. ""i wanna be your dog"" is my favorite, Sid growls, slurs and yelps through MY WAY, BELSEN WAS A GAS and I'M NOT YOUR STEPPING STONE, yells at the crowd, PUNK RAWK ;) 5 stars for content and minus no stars for poor recording quality and minus 1 star for changing the original title from ""sid live"" to ""sid lives""< cuz that's just tacky and stupid."
1,Don't bother..,"This book teaches all the wrong techniques for left hand, and barely even scratches the surface. There is a distinct lack of good books for beginners on the subject of technique, and although this one claims to fill the void, it fails to deliver. Using the techniques in this book you can be sure to develop tendonitis or carpel tunnel syndrome fairly quick, thus ending any potential career you may have imagined. I'm a beginner myself, and I have gleaned more from searching the web than from this book. Carol Kaye is highly recommended for good reason - go look at her website, at www.carolkaye.com and get her dvd lessons, you won't regret it!"
4,NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL FLAMENCO ALBUM,"I believe Artin is a bit FULL of himself - to post his review three times? Ego knows no bounds. If you are looking for really good traditional Flamenco, this is NOT, NOT the album for you. This is ""exquisitely"" atypical. If you have been listening to flamenco for years and are looking for that next ethereal phase, the next step beyond traditional flamenco, this is it. If you are a novice to flamenco, are will be left completely puzzled by what you hear. Listen to Paco's Fuerte y Caudal or Siroco instead, but not this album. It is beyond the earth bound realities of traditional flamenco, and is a song from Paco's heart about his lost love. This is ABSOLUTELY a love-it or hate-it album, even for Paco fans. Go get Gerardo Nunez or Rafael Riqueni instead, if you are looking for inspired next phase traditional Flamenco. Get Paco's earlier works for fabulous listening. BUY THIS CD AT YOUR OWN RISK, ONLY IF YOU ARE READY!"
4,Where is Ralph Wiggum?!,When I bought this game I thought that you can play as Ralph. But you can't. That made me mad!!!!! They should take out Nelson and put in Ralph or make ralph a secert character. They has never been a simpsons game that you can play as Ralph. Any way this is a great game. It is easy to win the compotishons. Just do grinds the entire time. Every time you jump and land back on the rail your blance will be in the middle again the same with manuals. The best character to play at the begging of the gme is Bart or Lisa.
1,The Reviewer Was Right About This Game Begin A Bad Copy,"To the reviewer that said this game is a bad copy, I did not mean to say that, but this game is good for rental, not to really own. This game was good at first, but the first two days of rental I really did not like it.So if you plan on buying this, go ahead, but I trust you will not like it."
2,I expected more,My favorite show is The Simpsons. So of course I bought The Simpsons Road Rage. I loved it. So then I bought The Simpsons Skateboarding. I don't like it so much. I love the Simpsons and I love skateboarding but the game is bad. The moves are hard to do and it's a little boring. The cheats codes aren't great and there's limited characters and stuff to do. My advice is buy The Simpsons Road Rage. It's funner and cheaper.
1,buyer beware,"I purchased this game for my 10 year old son for Christmas, even though the reviews I read were not glowing. Since I don't play these games myself, I figured it was just grousing. Was I ever wrong! My son, who loves the Tony Hawk games as well as the Simpson's Road Rage, found this Simpson's game to be virtually unplayable. It was frustrating to him because the tricks were difficult to perform in the time allowed and the combination of buttons to press were too complicated. I have watched him master other games (including SSX Tricky) and can't imagine how he manages to manuever them so well, which leads me to believe that this game is not well designed, as others had described in their reviews. Lesson learned: Listen to other reviewers who take the time to issue warnings!"
1,WARNING: This game should not be played!,"*sigh*. This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. I went back to the video rental store and demanded for my money back after playing this... If you have ever played Tony Hawk, then you will notice that the moves are opposite and slow. If you havent played Tony Hawk, get that instead. If you have played Tony Hawk, run away from this game!"
1,This Is The Worst Game Ever Made,"This is the worst game out of Road Rage and Hit and Run, I thought this would be a great game but I was wrong. [...] she surprised me by ordering NASCAR: RUMBLE, the best Nascar game ever made other than the ones on just tracks and not open roads.I have Road Rage and Hit and Run. I would recommend these two games instead of this stupid game, Skateboarding."
3,Simpson Games Really Are Not That Good,"I am an avid Simpson fan but you really have to come to the truth that Simpson game are really not that good. The graphics aren't that good, they really could be better, and the story line could use a little more effert into it. If they work on the story line like the show that game would be great. Let's face it Simpson Road Rage wasn't really good and Simpson Wrestling was horrible but as a fan i would still buy the game anyway."
2,"A game tries to succeed, and fails.","It's The Simpsons in a... skateboarding game? I thought it was pretty strange myself, but I guess it was brought onto the market because of how big The Simpsons are and how big skateboarding it. Sounds like a great match, of course, for me being a Simpsons fan and a skateboarding kid. Well it wasn't. The graphics were not good even for the cartoony look they had, the control was absolutely terrible, every trick wasn't fun to look at, the level design wasn't good, the lines characters say is repetetive, and there is just not a lot of characters to play as. I am a gigantic Simpsons fan, but that does not mean I like the video games. ( except Hit and Run and Road Rage. ) I definitely think you should pass this one up, everything about it is bad, which means NOTHING about it is GOOD."
4,Good game brand new,Got it 3 daysGrandson loved it doing all the jumpsHad a book to itGet the cheat to play all people
3,the only reason its 3 stars is cause i haven't played it yet,so far as i have seen in preview versions of this game the graphics look detailed dosn't look to be as horrible as one of those tony hawk clones but i really can't say much about it because i haven't played it yet.
1,Not many planes at all,Not that interesting at all. Very boring! Must been at a $50.00 budget filming! I expected the whole airline bit. From check-in to seeing the baggage go thru a maze of belts like the Movie Toy Story 2. Which I would give the 5 star review to!
4,nice product.....,I have used this with electrolyis on my face for a few strays ....i had it done with the cream and without.....without ...ouuchhhhhh..with....i would say about 50% reduction in pain but u must follow the instructions....do not rub it in and allow the 30-45 min for it to work.....I have yet to try on my bikini area and rest of my body where I epilate now with comfort.....I will repost when I use it with my epilator for my brazilian and let you guys know how it goes but the product does help.....any help is better than none when it comes to painful hair removal methods.
3,Half successful,"This worked before I went for laser hair removal on my hands, but only on the right side of my hand."
5,Did the trick!,"I had a starter hesitation problem on my '95 Ford F 150, and after finally narrowing it down to the solenoid I ordered one of these to replace it. Problem solved! Very happy to find this genuine Motorcraft part here on Amazon for such a good price. My local auto parts store only had generic replacement solenoids for the same price. I really prefer to use Ford or Motorcraft brand parts when I'm replacing a standard part on my truck. I just think they're better quality. This part didn't disapoint! Good price, good part, and my truck starts like it should!"
5,"Great, easy fix","This starter solenoid is high quality, Motorcraft brand and worked well as a replacement for my truck. The old solenoid in the truck lasted 250,000 miles and i'm confident this one will do the same."
4,My Granddaughter loves it!,I was looking for a conga drum that wasn't a toy; but wasn't too big for a 12 year old girl. This drum fit the bill perfectly! My granddaughter has played it every day since Christmas. It is exactly what I was looking for.
3,Cool Clock,This is a fantastic clock. Only problem is the adapter cord needs to be replaced as it is only for temporary use only.
4,Manic Pop Thrills?,"Well Its got great reviews in the mags and after I heard Comedy I decided that I had to buy it. So...yes its chock full of brilliant guitar pop songs..kicks Oasis and Embrace et al all over the gaff. However it loses a star because it fails to display a musical vision worthy of the melodies. At the end of the day its just another catchy English guitar pop album. Having said that, for its unpretentious pop moments over 12 flawless tracks I strongly recommend it."
5,Deserved success...,"A beautiful melancholy treaure, HMS Fable is the best British album of the 90's. Just as Michael Head looked on the brink of absolute anonymity in the British music scene, he popped up with this, a twelve-track, no-filler classic of brilliant songwriting. Armed with the grittiness of a drug-infested life, Head has created a loving and tender record. Natalie's Party and Comedy are cracking singles but it's the plaintive slow-burning Cornish Town and the Nick Drake-esque Daniella that really show Head's talent. This deserved to be an immediate success but it was not to be...here's looking forward to the next project. RECOMMENDED IF YOU LIKE THIS: Together Alone CROWDED HOUSE; A Century Ends DAVID GRAY"
5,Old Timers Make Good,"Brothers Michael and John Head, together with Ren Parry and Iain Templeton make up Shack. Michael and John formed the legendary early eighties UK band 'The Pale Fountains' - legendary for the size of the advance their record company gave them, before they had made a record. H.M.S Fable is an album, foremost, of songs. Great lyrics, great tunes and all done with an individual style. A must for all music lovers."
4,better than you'd expect.,"When a friend told me about this great band out of liverpool, playing 'guitar-led' music, i though 'here we go another beatles'. BUT then i heard this album. There are some obvious connections which can be made.... they are all scousers, they play their own music. Thats about it. The music is a blend of Gomez, Travis and James. They Lyrics are stunning and mindbending.The album could be compared with a few; 'Performance and Coctails' by the 'phonics or maybe the manics 'Everything must go' spring to mind. But don't be fooled it is an original, but with thinly veiled influences from the 'brit pop era'.in short buy this album. This band is not going to get much beyond the college common room, but all students will associate themselves with this band in the same way they did with the stereophonics..."
2,Disappointing,"I read glowing reviews of this CD in Q magazine and other music press touting the return of the masterful Head brothers from druggy obscurity. Among other things, this release was likened to the Pale Fountains' output of the mid-1980s. No such luck. This music suffers a lack of grace and wit. Instead, it largely served up slow folkish junkies' tales. Save your cash (or buy mine in the used bin)."
1,Better Books Are Available,"The author does a passable job of informing readers how to invest and what pitfalls to avoid, but there are some critical issues he carefully leaves out. A far better and more honest investment guide would be ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" by Burton G. Malkiel."
1,Save money by not buying this book,This book was a waste of my time and money. This guy is so full of himself he thinks he can peddle advice when he barely gets his definitions of basic finacial planning terms correct. Read the Richest man in Babylon and you will get all the advice you need.
1,"It requires a separate neutralizer, which wasn't provided. ...","It requires a separate neutralizer, which wasn't provided. It also said you need their special case. This is NOT convenient and I'd never choose this type of product. I prefer the all-in-one products. Then you don't have to worry about remembering multiple bottles."
3,I've used this product in the past and ...,"I've used this product in the past and had forgotten why I stopped using it. After using it and following all of the instructions and neutralizing my contacts, my eyes always seem to sting. I'm not sure if it's something in the product that I'm sensitive to or if I'm just not rinsing enough. I'd probably recommend it to a friend to try and if his or her eyes felt fine, great. As for myself, I don't think I'll use this again. I'll continue to use regular saline and multi-purpose saline."
2,There are better options out there,"I bought this to charge my phone while out in the boonies with the military. It didn't end up working out because the attachment didn't work with my later generation LG phone. A buddy used it to charge his Nokia but complained it took him a full day of winding to charge his phone. Luckily in the Army we often have whole days to throw away! The radio works but has poor reception and the battery for the LED flashlight didn't work well after a few months of not being used. I would not recommend this thing, especially for emergency use. Cell phones are better charged with AA-powered cell phone chargers and the inexpensive little shake-flashlights work great. An all-in-one doesn't seem to be the answer here."
5,ELTON BRITT THE RCA YEARS,I'AM 63 YRS OLD + AND GREW UP WITH MY PARENTS LISTENING TO ELTON BRITT AND GENE AUTRY. WE REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR! PEOPLE FROM OUR GENERATION ARE BECOMMING FEWER & FEWER. ELTON COULD SING AND WAS THE BEST YODELER EVER. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CD. ELTON ALSO DID SOME SWISS YOLDULING. MAYBE SOME RESEARCH WILL FIND IT.
1,Please Stop,"Dudes. This is the worst ever. You gotta be kidding me. Life is short. Don't do it to yourself. Please. Do not buy this album. It is so cheesy it hurts. Get some Heavenly, older Belle and Sebastian, the Beach Boys.If you like these guys then you probably like the Barenaked Ladies. And if you like these guys and you say you hate the barenaked ladies, then you are a hipster. My bad. I am dumb."
1,"Great movie, but no option for hearing Anglophones","This version of the DVD promises on the cover that English OR English Closed Captioning is available. In fact, the menu provides only English with closed captions, with all the little sound descriptions like [water sloshing], [cattle lowing], [people muttering] which, while possibly useful to the hearing-impaired, are a constant irritation for a hearing, non-Swedish-speaking viewer. I'm returning this DVD and will wait 'til Fox gets their presentation right, in line with the features description on the case. Sheesh."
5,Danish nightmare,"Life on a hellish Danish farm for two Swedish immigrants in the 19th Century, an old widower (Max von Sydow) and his son Pelle.. The Swedish farm workers are treated like slaves by their debauched landowner. Von Sydow is as good a father as he can be, but he's old and wants nothing more than finding a woman to take care of him. Pelle wants to escape to America and freedom. Von Sydow is excellent as the old man, who is proud but weak. The movie, packed with character and incident, is like a triple-decker Victorian novel, with Pelle at the end going off to make his way in the world, leaving his father behind. Perhaps a bit too long (135 min.) with some of the incidents on the farm repetitious and overly drawn out. But, all in all, this is an excellent film. Worth a watch."
3,Handle with care...,"Because this is primarily a selection of Boozoo Bajou's favourite tracks. Nothing wrong with that, but a lot of them are very different, far more ""easy listening"" than the highly atmospheric, often quite radical beats that permeate their other albums. Sure, you get two reasonable Boozoo Bajou cuts in ""Pflug"" & ""Back Up"", plus their stunningly beautiful remix of Tony Joe White's ""Rainy Night in Georgia"" (which is almost worth the price of the album on its own), but what surrounds them - good as it is - may not be what you're expecting and it's definitely worth checking out the sound clips first to avoid disappointment."
1,WHAT HAPPEN!,I was TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED with this compilation... what a waste. YOU CAN DO MUCH BETTER...
3,"Great for teachers, Fair for Art 1 Students","Great for Teachers- good review. A bit fast for some Comm college students and for some reason the narrator put them to sleep. You should judge for yourself- classes/students may be different. I suggest a video that integrates in lively fashion, artists life and times with the work. This is more a ""list"" of his works."
5,A must see,"This movie is more than worth a look. If you've ever struggled with loss or addiction this is a must see film. If your simply a fan of Martin Cummins then this film is a must see that gives you a unique insight unto the man behind the camera. It's a very powerfully moving peice of art that does not glamorize addiction at all but shows the cold hard truth about addicts. A very human film done with alot of love,respect and passion and i'm glad I got to see the labor of their love."
3,not as promised,"I was disappointed in this book. Although it has many ideas for practice building, very little of it applies specifically to finding clients who are willing to go around their insurance plans and pay cash for services. The rest of it could be found in any good marketing book. I was specifically interested in strategies for finding clients who will pay cash - all she really says here is that you need to be able to tell them why they should."
5,"Brilliant Hindemith from San Francisco, thanks to Blomstedt","One of the more significant satisfactions of my move to San Francisco in 1989 was experiencing the work that Herbert Blomstedt was producing with a growing symphony orchestra in a disadvantaged concert hall. While he could be pedestrian in the great romantic works of Tchaikovsky, he was no slouch in the central european classics of Beethoven, Bruckner and certain specialties like Nielson and Hindemith. This recording attests to the careful attention he paid to details of execution, blending of orchestral choirs and selection of appropriate tempi. You might snooze through a Blomstedt ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" but you paid careful attention to his Hindemith performances. Decca did an excellent job recording him both in San Francisco and Leipzig where I believe he improved the orchestra beyond what it provided Kurt Masur. Decca surpassed the Philips engineers in capturing the blended sound of this magnificent orchestra. Highly recommended."
3,Love Chris Freytag but...,"I love Chris Freytag's workouts but the cardio section of this one is lacking. She does v-steps, grapevine, toe-tap lunges, etc and has good beginner modifications. But, not enough repetitions of each, so consequently my heart rate never was elevated. She changes from one move to another too quickly and by the time I caught on to the next move - (hamstring curls, push-squats, etc.) she was changing to the next move."
4,Prevention Fitness System - Good for Beginners and Intermediate,"I have not done any sort of exercise other than the treadmill for a couple of years. I was concerned that this would be not only too hard but would make me too sore. But, because of the way you can mix and match work outs, it has been great. I just follow the ""beginner"" recommended version of each work out and have done really well with minimal soreness. I Love the Menu system which makes it very east to get going without having to fast forward through a preamble each day. I would recommend this program for anyone looking to change up their work out each day and still work the entire body. It is great all the way up through advanced Intermediate."
1,NOT for the real beginners,"I bought several exercise dvds from Amazon, knowing that some would be duds. This one goes in that pile.If you can follow what Chris Freytag is saying, it's probably great. But I'm a real beginner. I can't possibly follow the spead-of-light jargon this woman spews. The instructions sound something like this: Okay, Neekerbreekers! Mumble, mumble...right foot! Two More! Turn to the left! Back foot! Dihydrogen monoxide! Mumble, mumble. Heart's going. Gibblegabble! Get those arms up! Abs tight!Hunh?I haven't the faintest idea what she's telling me to do, nor does she stop to demonstrate anything, just plows on ahead. I jogged along feeling annoyed and inferior. Just the feeling I want from my personal training session. Not.If you can follow her instructions, this is probably a great dvd. But if like me you think a ""grapevine"" is the gossip circuit or a yummy Greek appetizer...give this a miss."
5,Just what I wanted,I am a fan of Chris Freytag so when I saw this I thought I would try it. The DVD is in great condition and just what I needed. It allows me to customize my workouts and even provides a plan if I should want more structure. Chris is easy to follow and very motivating.
2,beginner level,"I like Chris Freytag, but this DVD was a beginner level and I am at an intermediate level. I returned the DVD."
4,Still works for me,I have had this DVD for a few years now and once again cirlced back to it. I like the ability to select different workouts for my session. It gives me a good workout to make me feel like I have done some good and still have the ability to walk and function afterwards. I can set how long a workout I want. Most muscle groups are activated and there is good cardio too.
3,Personally not for me,"I liked the pre-programmed sections for target goals or that you could personalize the sections. The moves in the cardio and toning sections are very similar to what has been done before by Tamilee Webb. Are there only so many moves out there or can you come up with something fresh if you're going to the trouble to produce a new program? The instructor is pleasant enough, very muscular compared to her background people and provided a modified version (but used the wrong back-up person to do it). The warm-up was not long enough for stretches, the cardio spots A and B were OK but did not raise my heart rate a great deal (although I did break a sweat). The cool-down section was good because it presented some nice modified yoga stretches. I would be willing to look at other workouts by this instructor but just not this one."
3,Ok for quick workouts,"Like someone else posted, this is definitely beginner. The reps are minimal - but I like them. I like being able to select and choose which work out to use. I think that more fitness DVDs should go this route so that you can change it up. It kind of allows you to have a larger variety with one DVD.I like to use this DVD when I don't have a lot of time to work out. If I only have 30 min. I can fit it in and it works well. However, with so few reps, I increased the weights that I use."
4,Chris Freytag grows on you,"Some of the Prevention/Chris Freytag workouts are geared toward beginners. This is one of them in my opinion, but it has a lot of variety and provides overall a good workout. I once thought I didn't like Chris, but over time I totally changed my view. In fact, I'm really hooked now. She is great and I love her workouts. Her more advanced DVDs are awesome and total fun."
2,Only for beginners,"I loved the fact that you can program your fitness segments, but this tape should be labeled just for beginners. The toning segments didn't fatigue my muscles, and the cardio I barely broke a sweat.If you are a beginner, this is a great video to start with. They only do 6 reps for weights most of the time and the cardio is not too hard to follow, or too hard to do.In all 5 stars for beginners, 2 stars for intermediate/advanced."
2,Not Challenging Enough!,"I bought this DVD a month ago, and I'm sad to say that I'm already putting it on the bottom of my stack of aerobics DVDs.I haven't done aerobics in years, but have come back to it when I remembered recently how much I used to like to do it. And, in finally deciding to get serious about losing about 15 pounds, I need to drastically increase my cardio. But I'm too broke to join a gym!I was hoping that this would carry me through at least a few months, but I've done it twice and I'm already not feeling challenged. I can be really clumsy and uncoordinated, but Freytag's aerobics combinations are a bit boring/uninspiring even for me.Also, on the segments where she does work with free weights, she only does 7 reps for each exercise ONCE, and then moves on. I know that this DVD is for beginners, and there are those who might find this challenging, but I was hoping that I picked some starter workouts that I could grow with and aspire to mastering. This one just didn't fit the bill."
4,"Very detailed, yet still an excellent read!","This book is a remarkable piece of scholarship. Cossnever makes a claim that he can't give solid examplesfor. It is extremely insightful in the 'real' life,and looks at real women's lives, not just popularlore. It's detailed nature can be slightly hard to'get into', but if one keeps reading, it is yieldsfascinating information and becomes immenselyengrossing!"
3,Not what I thought,"I thought I was going to get the two book set when I ordered this, but only the workbook came. I didn't want to bother to return it because the workbook was less expensive than the shipping. When I recieved it the workbook had the tools that I needed just then, but I could sure use the text now."
4,Finally some Pagan Solstice Music!,"I am very happy to finally find a CD with Pagan Carols. I really like the fact that it uses traditional tunes but with Pagan lyrics so they are easy to learn and everyone knows the melody already, so it really makes it easy to incorporate in rituals. The only downfall I have found is that the written lyrics in the CD cover has a LOT of typos and a lot of the words do not match what is actually being sung in the CD. So in order to type up copies of the lyrics for others to read when caroling i have to compare the lyrics to the CD itself to make sure the errors are fixed prior to ritual. Other than that, GREAT!!!!"
4,The Best of the Best are in this collection,"While I haven't read every story in the book, I've had a wonderful taste that has whetted my appetite to read it from cover to cover. I can't wait until it releases this summer so I can treat myself to stories by some of the best authors in the business."
3,great product wrong part,i would say a lot of good things about this product. unfortunately i have not been able to mount them to my car because they do not fit.what i can say is that they are rust proof. i waited too long to try and fit them to my car and exceeded the time in witch i could return them. i think most people will not wait as long as i did. you will have no issue with returning if they are the wrong fit.
4,"Sweet, entertaining","This is the second work in the Turham Malpas series, the story of life in an atypical English village where crazy stuff is always going down. In this volume the villagers are shocked when the old big house gets changed into a fitness center staffed by annoying outsiders. There's also a flower festival, a kidnapping, and sides chosen in a village-wide debate over the practice of poaching.Quote: ""Heavens above, I shall hardly hare to go out.""This series is incredibly enjoyable. This second installment is just as good as the first one, and it focuses on a different main group of villagers than the first book does - although the characters from The New Rector (the first novel) are featured in secondary roles."
4,A good buy,"This is the third looseleaf we have purchased from Gower and we found it every bit as useful as the first two. As well as plenty of essential basic background info, ideas for strategy development and implementation etc, it gave us a ready to use program that we were able to easily tailor to our needs and roll out to everyone. I would recommend this book to anyone needing to communicate the fundamentals of KM and its benefits to their staff."
1,Landfill material,"This book was very hyped, so I bought it (even though it was very expensive). Imagine my disappointment when it turns up as a binder (even though it is advertised as a hardcover) and is a course in KM. A bad course as well. You can miss this without any regrets. In fact, it could be used as landfill material in my new house, as that is probably the best value I can get out of it?"
2,When can we get something new.,"The tracks are repeats of great oldies songs tht in the proper time can be very good. All the band seems to be doing is releasing or re-releasing or re-re-releasing their older tunes. As a long time fan, greater than 20 years, I am starving for something new, especially with Bill Champlin. Needless to say I returned the CED for a refund because Chicago at Carnegie Hall was better."
3,Yet another re-release,"Made in GER in 2000, Serial# HALMCD-1003, Playing Time 42:53This disc is 1 of many versions of a concert played by CHICAGO at 1969's Toronto Rock & Roll Revival.As usual, though a track is credited as ""Beginnings"", it's in fact ""Introduction"". The album is fairly recorded, with good performances by the band.This album has been issued under so many titles by various obscure labels, with various running orders, that if you've got a concert that has NOT been published by COLUMBIA or CHICAGO RECORDS, you've probably got this..."
5,good,i enjoy this chip as much as a piece that gets plugged in and ignored can be enjoyed.it functions well and i plan on getting another so i have a 4gig set. price is pretty good and it is pretty.
2,Does not live up to its Billing....,"I thought this would decode the secrets of Comics Guaranty Corp (CGC) and their ""we're not telling you why we graded it that way"" philosophy. Unfortunately, I found myself trying to see the flaws with a magnafying glass. Closeups of flaws would be much better. Yes, it's a very pretty book with lots of ""neat"" comic covers, but a total waste of money. If the goal was to keep comic collectors in the dark, in regards to grading on a 10 point scale, you suceeded Mr. Overstreet!"
5,One of the best Bomberman Titles!,"I'm a Bomberman fanatic, and I still rate this game in the top 5 that I've played. Even you people who don't like Bomberman will enjoy this fun-filled game!..........."
1,alborada,i have brought this DVD of alborada two time and both time the DVD there was something wrong with it. you should make sure the product that people purchased is good before you send it out.
3,Alborada,"We truly enjoyed being able to view the movie without all the commercials seen on a regular TV screen. The only thing we did not appreciate was how much of the movie had been edited out of the CD, some of the scenes were very important to the story line. Also the music in the background did not sound like the same music on the TV version. If I had known how much of the movie had been edited out I may not have bought the CD. In the end we did enjoy the movie and look forward to acquiring another one, hopefully it won't be that chopped up."
3,Comentario Sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Alborada,"El Producto me llego Mal, los Discos Bastantes Maltratados, un poco Rayados, pero se ven bien.Aunque a muchas personas no le agrado mucho la Edicion del Dvd debo confesar que a mi me gusto, no tanto como para contradecir a las demas personas, pero considero que tiene coherencia, no como otros Dvds que no se entiende la Historia de tanto que la cortan.La Telenovela es Muy Interesante, tiene Historia, y un Gran Elenco, en todo sentido, es una Gran Obra, y las Actuaciones de los Actores son Magistrales.Si me hubiese gustado que el Final de Juana/Daniela Romo y Diego/Luis Roberto Guzman fuese otro, con mucho más fuerza, adrenalina, suspenso, en fin, mas emocionante, pero eso es una Critica hacia al Historia de la Novela, no al Dvd. Pero pese a eso me gusto.Contiene Extras, el Videoclip de la Cancion Alborada de Placido Domingo, un Especial con Adela Micha, Bloopers, Detras de Camaras y mucho más..."
1,"La Mentira, alborada, corazon salvaje, etc. dvd","I saw the originals broadcast on TV. Liked them so much I bought several of them from Amazon and Wal-Mart. But the DVD are edited SO MUCH, it's unbelievable. So much is chopped up. Can't follow the story line. These Spanish soaps when they make it on DVD get edited by up to 70% that it's a waste of money to purchase them. I won't do so again. Maybe if you the sellers mentioned to your distributors of this problem they would improve the editing. Keep the entire story but sell it for a bit more money. Many people would pay more to get the entire FULL story."
3,Alborada,I watched on TV and then bought the DVD to watch again. A bit choppy but still a wonderful story. And yes I cried at the end--it's a novela!
1,"Great Episodes, Bad DVD",Don't buy it. There are errors on the DVD and my DVD player can't read the episode where Ann dresses like a chicken. Its unfortunate because that is one of my favorite episodes. The recording before this episode seems to be pretty good. Its a shame.
1,That Girl,"I loved watching the tv espisodes when the series was on tv but the price of the dvd is unreal, I would never pay that much for a dvd. I think it is way out of line."
5,Absolutely Wonderful DVD!,"Because of the other reviews knocking the DVD, I put off purchasing this one. I finally did it though, and I'll never regret it. I spent a wonderful day sharing some of my past with my daughter. I found absolutely NO glitches in the DVD. The picture was clear and so was the sound. It was as innocent and entertaining as I remember. It's hard to pick which episode I liked best, because they were ALL truely good, But I guess if pressed, I'd have to say that the best was the one at the end where Marlo's father makes his appearance and sings with Marlo. But all the shows they picked for this disc were very good. I smiled and laughed all afternoon. I know that my daughter and I will watch this disc MANY times."
5,COMING TO DVD IN MAY '06,"I was fortunate enough to have purchased this DVD many years back when it was only 20 bucks. Watching the episodes on the disc reminded me of how entertaining this show is. Very good quality in the transfer.The good news is that season one of this show will become available in May of this year. Their is also talk that one of the ""special features"" on the disc, will include commentary from the show's star, Marlo Thomas. It's great to see some of these older sitcoms, that we don't see on any of the cable channels, are starting to be released on DVD. (The Doris Day Show another fun one, will be releasing season 3 in May also). ;-)"
3,Nifty,"An interesting game, but a better weekend rent than a purchase. It gets way too predictable once you get to be a decent player."
3,"Puritanical virtues alive and well, but the economy?","This book was quite dumb, and all that it does is emphasize how dumb people can be. If you're a Republican right-winger who's more interested in a president's, a man's, sexcapades than what he does with the economy, then read on by all means. This mindless book was made for you."
1,TALES FROM the OVAL OFFICE or IF WALL COULD WRITE,"If walls could write stories, this would have been a more interestingly written tome. MONICA'S STORYs' dispassionate tone suggest that the author was trying to protect Monica by cleverly presenting the tale as if nothing sexually exciting took place between her and the president; or the author is merely a gallant gentleman who came forward to give hope and support to a suffering young woman who had made several silly mistakes that had caught up with her and was giving her a public chastisement she and the world will long remember.Regardless what the author's intent, he managed to produce a profoundly BORING BOOK. I highly recommend it to insomniacs who have counted every sheep in the galaxy. It works better than Nembutal, guaranteed! Hopefully, this experience has taught this young lady that she can't have everything she wants and that she better stop wanting other women's husbands."
2,appeared to be a simple recreation of a sexual affair.,Was like so many affairs with married men and ended in much the same way. The end result is almost always the same. The man satisfies his need for outside pleasures and then lives happily ever after with his wife or until the next conquest comes along. In all fairness to men this isn't just confined to the male gender since many married women do this as well. Was nothing different about this other than the fact that Monica's man was the President of the United States.
5,"Fascinating, fast paced innocence in the corruption of Gov.","Fascinating, fast paced innocence in the corruption of Government at the highest level. Andrew Morton gives another dimension to this saga...we can all only wonder what the true end to this real life drama will be - the intensity of emotion shows it has not completed and therefore not over yet. These two powerful people have yet to combust...and like forbiidden fruit ""Monica's Story"" is only a beginning. A great read."
4,"Well Written, but The Biases Were Obvious","I normally would not have picked this book up. I did and got into it. Andrew Morton wrote a very readible book. Where I take him to task is I think he ended up seeing Monica Lewinsky like one of his daughters. He has a fatherly feeling for her that denies objectivity (which is why I could not give five stars). He has definite good guys and villains. By the time he was done with Linda Tripp and the FBI agents, I thought they were going to be burned at the stake. Not saying Monica Lewinsky is a bad person, but not as innocent as Andrew Morton would leave you to believe. Remember, it takes two to tango."
1,I'm sorry to say that I couldnt even finish it,"It may be wrong of me to even write a review here since I couldnt even finish the awful thing, but I would like to just say that this was the most boring, unreadable, obnoxious piece of garbage I have looked at in a long while. I would give it no stars if I could,and if any of you are thinking of buying this book, stop yourself, it isnt what you think it's going to be. Borrow it from the library as I did, it'll save you some buyer's remorse."
1,She thinks she's middle class? That explains a lot.,"I had a higher opinion of Monica before the book. It was obvious Morton had difficulty making the minimum number of words required, so he found it necessary to repeat things over and over and OVER. I got it the first time, thanks. At least he hit the nail on the head when he said ""she has a high sense of entitlement"". No kidding.A painful read. Don't waste your time."
4,VERY ENLIGHTENING BOOK ON OUR GOVERMENT,"THIS BOOK MADE VERY INTERESTING READING. I FEEL IT DID NOT MAKE MONICA LOOK VERY GOOD MORE LIKE A VERY YOUNG,EMOTIONLY UNBALANCEDWOMEN. THE VALUE OF THIS BOOK IS IN SHOWING EVERYONE JUST HOW OUT OF CONTROL OUR GOVERMENT IS."
4,I think it took a lot of courage to write this book.,I thought that this book was great. The press has bashed Monica for so long not know how she has felt and this gives her a way to speak out.
2,Quick read for a one day flight if you have nothing else,Obviously rushed into print to capitalize on media hype and name recognition. Nothing new and a pretty mindless story of juvenille justification of a young woman with a plan to capitalize on her one talent.
4,A Modern Hester Prynne,"""Monica's Story"" reminded me of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"", one of the classics in American literature. Monica is a modern Hester Prynne, whose life was torn between her unquenchable love for a modern Dimmesdale and her agonizing remorse for whata had happened."
1,A Mistitled Espose,"The best thing about this book was defintely the cover and the nice printing design. However I strongly feel that it was mistitled. It could have been called, ""Getting Ahead"", or ""Fun With Your Havana"". At any rate, it is a great comedic work which reaches new heights of mediocrity!"
2,Her Camps Point of View (POV),"Monica Samille Lewinsky appears to be either incredibly naive or incredibly childish. This book is not a page turner. If you are interested in her camps' POV... then you may like this book. The author says her ""disorderly routine and her neurotic behavior over weight perfectly explain why she never cleaned the notorious blue Gap dress that was stained with the President's semen"" (page 11).She is characterized as very naive. She documented every little detail as if it was major, which appears that she had a motive for the future use of this information. It gave me thoughts that she was contemplating possible blackmail, book deals, and/or movie deals.Yet again... she was either incredibly smart, naive, or silly."
1,Terrible literature. Forgetable. Ordinary soap opera.,"When this book was released, I though to myself that it would be an unique oportunity to know what happened beetwen now former US President Bill Clinton and White House trainee Monica Lewinsky, inside the Oval Office.Sorry, my mistake. This book is nothing else but pure sensationalist garbage. To me it's much more like a mexican soap opera full of tears and disapointments from an (supposed) innocent girl concerning to her middle-age boss, the most powerful man on the planet, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.Keep yourself and your money away from this book, if you can.This is my sincere advice to you all.One star well deserved, considering I can not give half a star."
3,She needs to stop scapegoating everything.,"I had to do a report at school on this book; so I know a little something about it. In this book she would scapegoat everything. It says that at a wedding she didn't want to wear her dress a certain way, so that's why she is so demanding. I mean COME ON....GEEZ.... what is up with that.But out of all the blaming I do reccomend it."
1,Not believable. Monica accepts almost no responsibilty.,"The book is amazing for its inconsistentcies. We've got a (supposedly) incredibly bright girl who can't pass high school English and doesn't realize that filing a false affidavit with a federal court is a serious offense? This lack of morals is not only shown by the ease in which she describes getting an abortion (although sorry about it later) or ""messing around"" with married men, but also the fact that she actually believes that lying under oath is no big deal. While I did have some sympathy for Monica given the vindictive nature of Linda Tripp & the independent counsel's office, she lost this sympathy when she failed to acknowledge her responsibility. The fact that Monica still believes there was an actual loving relationship with her ""handsome"" can only summon pity, not sympathy.Don't waste your time or money on this book--there is nothing new."
3,"Not bad, but............","I enjoyed reading this book, but if Monica was trying to change the public's opinion of her, she didn't succeed. She comes across as extremely immature and self-centered. The book is full of excuses. My personal favorite was the reason for hanging on to the ""stained blue dress"" - the reason being that Monica had to watch her finances and couldn't really spend the extra money to get it dry cleaned. Then in another chapter it talks about how she spent either $100 or $125 (can't remember the exact amount) on a book for the President. Kind of contradicts itself. I also thought it was rather amusing that she became upset when seeing the President and Hillary with their arms around one another while on vacation. I mean, if she actually thought she meant something to the President, I guess she found out otherwise."
1,Someone Spare Us,"Andrew Morton proves he can write more drivel about poor little rich girls as he laughs all the way to the bank.Morton's flowery, sappy prose makes the book read like a cheap pulp romance.Morton doesn't understand the notion of personal responsibility, which is to be expected all the more from those of privileged backgrounds. A girl who pulls up her skirt to the married President does not deserve sympathy. Monica says she is of a generation that is comfortable with its sexuality, but there are clearer ways to describe her behaviour.The part about Monica dumping her boyfriend because he saw another woman -- while she of course was also seeing Clinton -- says it all."
4,This is a dramatic and sad tale where everyone loses.,"Having followed this story quite closely, the book puts into perspective the journey Monica went through. Andrew Morton reveals in a very acute way the torments that her family had to endure. I am amazed that they survived it. Monica must be a very strong woman. The chapter about Ginsberg was a bit long. What interested me the most was the relationship itself and its complexities and to this day it still remains enigmatic. Clinton has a lot of questions to answer concerning his love for Monica but I guess we will never know. The part dealing with the FBI was disturbing, in a sense that it brought the people involved close to endangering their lives. Shocking really. Monica is to be admired and respected by all of us."
4,Very informative. She wasnt as mute as MSNBC said.,"This book opens many insights as to how this nation keeps track of its government officials and how things can get out of control. It is an eye opener, but I find few answers to many of the questions. But, very interesting. Some seems a little caddy."
4,Monica and All Too Human paint a great picture of Washington,"The two books, Monica's Story and All Too Human : A Political Education by George Stephanopoulos, make for a great one-two punch on the scandal regardless of how you feel about the events and the people that created them. This scandal, after all is said and done, is about being human. Something Kenneth Starr and the Republicans couldn't figure out."
2,One word... TERRIBLE!,"So Monica was a fat girl growing up in Beverly Hills with a Dad who didn't show her enough affection, who cares? If this was suppose to make me feel sorry for her, I didn't work. Don't waste your time with this one."
4,interesting read,"Monica just could not get it right. A betrayed friendship by Linda Tripp, a married lover, a lawyer who's ego became his downfall and in the end she was nothing but a civilian who became a pawn in a dangerous political game of lets be the ones to oust the President. Better drama than TV viewing, the sad part is it really happened. How Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr can lie straight in bed at night is beyond all comprehension. Well now they have had their 15minutes of fame lets hope they both disappear forever. Good luck to Monica's new life and she is lucky to come from a very supportive family."
4,"Monica""s Story","Monica"" Story put a different spin on the story we all feel we know. It did not focus on the blue dress and all the details of the sexual encounters but instead defined for the reader where Monica and the President were coming from during the two year affair. It was an eye opener for me on the availability of the President. Liked the book."
5,Excited,"Glenn Meade was a fortuitous find when I was on vacation in Costa Rica. One of his books was on a shelf at the resort's dining/pool area. I was thrilled to discover this author. His book was fantastic, and made my vacation even more memorable. When I returned home, I immediately ordered another book, then another, and another. All his books have been exciting, adventurous, and have kept me at the edge of my seat. I'm almost done reading all of his novels, and hope to see him write more soon. I recommend all of his novels; they're wonderful. As for ordering through this vendor, there was a slight problem with the order, but they rectified the problem immediately and I was very pleased with their friendly and responsive customer service. I would order through them again anytime!"
3,Motorhead - 'Iron Fist' (Metal-Is) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1982,as this was their seventh lp as well as the follow-up to the notorious 'Ace Of Spades' landmark album.'Iron Fist' also marks the final vinyl appearance with guitarist Fast Eddie Clarke.I know it may sound bleak,but believe me,it's not near as bad as it sounds.Memorable cuts here include the title track ""Iron Fist"",""Heart Of Stone"",""Loser"" and ""Speed Freak"".There's five(5)bonus tunes tagged on to lure you to purchase this reissue.Some fine British '80's metal to be fully taken in,if you can handle it.I just KNEW 'Ace Of Spades' would be quite difficult to match."
5,suspenseful read!,"Claudia Hershey is a top new character for me. I enjoyed every minute of this cannot put down police proceedural set in the dark side of Florida. Forget Mickey Mouse, he doesn't live in this part of town."
3,"This book provides quite a laugh for us ""poor folks""","Okay, I know that the extremely wealthy are not like the rest of us. This book was very humorous and has the makings for a Hollywood movie, complete with the perfect ""Hollywood"" ending. It was a good read, LOTS of characters though. Throughout the book, I really never did feel bad at all for the main character, Jo Slater. She lived in such a shallow, protected world, that when she had to face the real world, she still clung to her own ways. I mean, she's flat broke, but owns a necklace that belonged to Marie Antoniette. Okay, now I probably would have sold it ASAP and just moved to a new city and lived off the $250 million from the necklace. Oh no, not Jo Slater. She's got revenge on her mind. Can you just imagine being reduced to Hush Puppy shoes, having to work in a department store, and no place to wear your coture gowns? The horror!It's an easy read but very far from a world I know. It is fun to see how the other half lives though."
5,My all time favorite!,"I love'd this book! I have read it so many times and it just gets better. This is a story that you remember, it sticks with you and holds on to you. I enjoyed the characters, Jo was so interesting, you felt her emotions and wanted her to ""win""! This book will remain a favorite of mine for years. I have loaned it out and had many friends go and buy their own copy after they read mine so that they could read it again and enjoy it some more. I highly recommend this one!"
2,likable but unbelievable,I liked reading this book and was intrigued with the descriptions of the very wealthy. Unfortunately some of the most significant aspects of the plot absolutely did not ring true. One example is that the lawyer and witnesses (notary publics)did not ask the Monique impersonator for indentification. I don't think this would happen in real life. There were a few instances where the reader was asked to suspend belief and this kind of ruined the book for me.
2,"Okay, okay, I get it...","So the writer is well versed in Marie Antoinette and proceeds to use 300+ pages to beat this expertise into our heads. The book was just a little too precious with its cast of characters and their turns of phrase. I was not the least bit surprised who would be murdered and how it would take place, as the author chose to telegraph the method at least 100 pages beforehand.I believe there is something inauthentic in writing what you know when the first 250 pages speak in exquisite, never-ending detail of historical anecdote and the author glosses over the actual point of the plot. By now it's anticlimatic."
4,Perfect Beach Read,"The woman in the book store said that she hadn't read it but that it was flying out of the store. I can see why!!! I purchased it and spent the next day on the beach devouring it.Perfect beach book, easy read, good plotting and thoroughly enjoyable."
2,barely got through it,I read the description for this book before buying it online as well as the reviews and I was looking forward to getting a peak inside the New York social set. I was greatly disappointed by how slow the story moved. You start getting to the good part at around page 240. When the story begins to get good is when Ms.Hitchcock seems to rush the story and not detail that part as much as she bored you with detail about the Marie Antionette furniture and jewel. It took me weeks to read this book versus a day it usually takes me to read a book if it's good. I couldn't advise this book to anybody.
3,Started So Promising...,"I loved this book when I started it, however, I turned out to be disapointed.Lucius' death came way too early because after that, the whole book just became repetitive as Jo slipped further and further down the social ladder and became even more obsessed with the Contessa. And as it became obvious that years were passing instead of weeks, it just stopped making sense that Jo wouldn't have packed her bags and left New York after so much time and misery.I enjoyed it enough to read the sequel, but I think the author could've had a much better book if she'd cut it down by about 100 pages."
4,Not so sweet revenge,"One of the leaders of the New York social set, Jo Slater,is devastated when her philandering, millionaire husband dies and leaves his entire fortune to his mistress, young, beautiful French Countess Monique de Passy, who befriended Jo with the express purpose of ferreting out her closest secrets so that she might put together a huge swindle. Jo finds herself penniless after a lifetime of having nothing but the best and is hard put to raise enough money to eke out an existence. It's a fascinating tale which gives amazing insights to the lives of the VERY rich and famous and also to the workings of the mind of that most dangerous of creatures..a woman wronged who is out for revenge in a big way! It's a quick, funny and highly enjoyable short read."
2,Not a good read,"Boring, predictable, and unimaginative. Don't waste your time. You knew from the beginning what was going to happen, and it did. I sometimes got lost in the middle of a sentence (they were do long) and had to re-read it. Skipped over whole pages of junk, and still got the point. Save your money for a better book!"
4,"Lattes like Starbucks, but in your home","I received this frother as a Christmas gift last year and am planning to purchase it for others this year. It works wonderfully and is so easy to clean. The only negative is that the stand broke at the base when it got knocked over on our countertop. However, I still use the wand all the time."
1,Do Not Buy This CD! Do Not Buy This CD!,"Do not buy this CD! The selections on this CD are some of the best Upstart songs, the problem is that these are not the original recordings that were released on vinyl years ago. The recordings are not even acceptable alternate versions. Droogskins comment that this is the best Upstart album has to be a joke of some sort. For all you young ones starting out, try and get your hands on the Upstarts first (best of), Angel Dust. It blows this garbage to pieces."
1,Sounds like a bad bootleg,"Most of this sounds like a live album without crowd noises, aside from a few songs that sound like badly taped copies of old records. As someone who's been curious about the Angelic Upstarts but doesn't really know their material, I'd have to say this is darn near worthless.The album cover and insert are completely uninformative. You see this in a record store or advertised online, and assume that it is what it claims to be: a compilation of the band's best songs. But there are no liner notes, no discography, no source information. The sound isn't very good. For all intents and purposes, this might as well be a bootleg. And a lousy one at that."
1,Crud on Plastic: Not What I Expected,"Note: the low rating refers only to the quality of the recording, not the group or their songs.I bought this CD from another source which, unlike Amazon, did not reveal fan reviews and the like. It just said that it was a great collection of an essential punk group (UK OI type).I think the Upstarts are a great, great group badly, badly misserved by this compilation. I have to agree with the consensus--terrible recording sound, worse than many bootlegs. The sound is so thin, you just can't imagine how awful it is; it has no hope of capturing the power and majesty of this group.If the group consented to this release, they must have decided to cash in."
5,Terrific novel,"I'm not a sports fan, but I found this book enthralling, well-written and generally terrific. Higgins spends a lot of time on the sports world as seen through agents' eyes, and even though you couldn't pay me enought to make me watch a hockey or basketball game, it was fascinating. Just as John McPhee in the nonfiction arena can write about oranges, or geology, or taking out the trash, and by his prose skills make it fascinating to the general reader, so too Higgins pulls off the same thing in this novel. I have been a fan of his since 1972 when his first book, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, was published. He writes a lot and rarely disappoints; he certainly does not do so here. Any reader who enjoys a good story, excellent prose and first-rate dialogue will enjoy this book tremendously; if you're a sports fan, you will have an additional dimension added to your enjoyment."
3,"Better , but still relatively disappointing.","Looks like everyone's been a fan since ""Friends of Eddie Coyle"". Problem is, since say,""Cogan's Trade"", the dialogue has so far outstripped the narrative that the plots are hard to follow, and, even more importantly, the conclusion is left up in the air. That's a real problem with this effort, too. Narrative returns, but exits shortly thereafter. And it seems like Higgins gets to the last chapter and decides, ""I'd better finish this right now."" Nevertheless, I always look forward to a new Higgins book. (""Swan Boats at Four"" is a definite exception). Maybe it's the Woody Allen phenomenon: I keep hoping Woody will be funny again, and that George will write another ""Eddie""."
2,A treatise on sports agency disguised as a murder mystery.,I was very disappointed with this book. The majority of the story was a description of the trials and tribulations of a high flying sports agent and his insufferable clients and employees. It seemed that all at once the author decided that there was a murder to solve and only one chapter left to do it. It read more like an expose than a fiction novel.
1,This book isn't good,"Come on people; a ""literary thriller"" should still be readable, with discernible plot and some nodding acquaintance with reality. This book has none of these things. It is entirely dialogue-driven, which is fine, but nobody talks that much and so well. I could go on, but bottom line is that as much as I had heard about Friends of Eddie Coyle and looked forward to reading it, it was good but not great. This book is just plain bad. Face it--if ""George D. Higgins"" and not ""George V. Higgins"" was on the cover, it wouldn't have made it past an editor's desk."
3,Not Quite There,"Everybody has a little freak in them..or do they?""The Freak Within"" is the story of five individuals - Kia, Ari, Phyllis, Simeon, and Maine. Kia, Ari, and Phyllis are friends. Kia, a hairstylist, is a married mother of one. Ari may be business savvy, but can't seem to get a grip on her personal life. Phyllis has to fight daily to keep her legs closed. Simeon is Kia's husband. Maine is a longtime friend of Ari's.Based on the title alone, I couldn't wait to delve into the pages of this book. Page after page after page, I kept asking myself the same question - Where is the FREAK? Aside from the issues of one character, the title was lost on me. The book had potential, but fell short. A few characters were underdeveloped and quite a few things I found to be inconsequential to the story. I applaud the author for her effort and would be willing to give her sophomore novel a try."
5,Buchanan Crimping insulator,Great product. Haven't used it in years but was very happy that they are still in business. Using these to finish our basement.
4,Coltrane collectors take caution,"This box earns four stars (and should earn five) simply for the quality of the performances. On stage, the classic Coltrane quartet stretched the tunes out, often to more than double the studio length, building to incredible levels of intensity. There's no complaint with the music on this collection--eight hours of Coltrane at arguably his peak. But the record company has been careless (if not blatantly dishonest) with the recording information. The worst example is where they mislabel one set as ""Hamburg 1961 (previously unreleased)"" when in fact it is a frequently issued 1962 recording from Birdland in NYC. There are other similar errors."
2,Dogloo Ooo aghh,"The pad at first is a great idea and then you realize that it doesn't last very long. Then when you go to by another one, you find out that the pad cost half as much as the house itself. There is something wrong with that picture. I used to live and Va and shop at Care- A-Lot. They are a very reliable source for good animal products. i guess when they stopped carry this product, thar shold have been a big clue. Now, I am stuck trying to find something that will work for the oddly yet functionally shaped house. What do I do!?! Where do I go!?!"
5,Nice Indigo Dog Mat,I have to give this 5 stars just because it lasted longer then 30 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! This was my dogs third mat. The other two didn't make it past 30 minutes. This one has been in since Christmas. I have a large dog and definitely want something in his Indigo Dog house to provide him comfort. I took the indigo apart and worked with the base as I always do. I positioned it and then added duct tape around it to help keep it down (just like the other two). This time he has left it alone and is very comfortable in his Indigo. The only thing I did different this time was order it from Amazon rather than buy it in the store. Do this time I can say it is an outstanding mat!!!! If you have a dog that is a chewer or loves to tear things up you probably will want to tape it down with duct tape like I did. Goes completely around the base in crisscross.
4,"Complicated, but worth it!","Although it was difficult for me to maneuver through the language that Hulme uses and through the literary structure changes between each piece, I found this collection to be rich with insights into the Maori culture and values. Each tale, some easier to understand from the get go than others, like the or the chilling tale of working in the fish industry in ""Moonfish"" to the daintiness that appears in ""Incubation,"" were both an appetizing way of opening my eyes in to New Zealand and it became more than just the place where they filmed Lord of the Rings. I think this is a great collection and even though I had to reread the stories a few times, I definitely agree with others and would recommend this read!"
5,The most consistent performance of Cooke's version,"I've been listening to this recording all afternoon, and felt no need to take it off the disc player. Compared to the first Rattle recording and the Slatkin/Mazzetti recording, I believe the Chailly beats them both in terms of musical consistency and aural sound quality, respectively. (As a serviceable alternative, I'd recommend the Slatkin, if for nothing else his fascinating Mahler lecture [recorded on a bonus CD] and for the only complete performance of the Mazzetti version in the catalog.)IMHO, the Chailly/Cooke recording sounds the most Mahlerish. Listening to a friend's recording of Rattle's most recent recording of the tenth, Sir Simon seems to have handled the score's omissions better but now the tempos seem too slow and deliberate for me.Until something better comes along--or, of course, if Mahler decides to revise the work from beyond the grave--I'd highly recommend the Chailly version."
4,Everyone must love Schlock!,This is the directorial debut of John Landis and also practice for Make-Up Artist and Creature Creator Rick Baker as they were both very early in their careers for this venture; as well as well before An American Werewolf in London. The film revolves around basically a sasquatch type apeman (played by Landis)who falls in love with a woman and all the campy hijinks he gets into in the town. If you like other Landis movies this thing rules! Plus tons of camp as in Kentucky Fried Movie... GO SCHLOCK!
1,Schlock schucks!,"This has undoubedly entered my memory as the absolute worst film of all time. The acting, the premise, the unfolding story etc, all make it incredibly dumb, idiotic and insipid. So much in fact, that I would actually recommend you to see it, just so you have an idea exactly how BAD a movie can be.... truly.I would rather sit through a marathon of Pokemon than this schlock!"
4,Exactly how it looks,"Very shallow, plenty sturdy, with good-sized compartments. It's exactly what it looks like, true to color as well. I needed something less than 2"" deep (not common among drawer organizers), and this fit perfectly for what I needed."
2,Not worth it !,"wait for the newer version ... at the exception if you like russian substitle ,.... so too expensive ( the newer version is around $50), russian subtitle... do I need to say more?"
1,Don't buy it,"HTML version of an article omits 9 figures. All of them! Not good idea for an article titled ""Metaschemas ..."""
5,Neon Chevy Clock,My husband loved getting this clock for Christmas. It is proudly hanging in our garage. It goes well with his Corvette.
4,"Clock was nice, although a little cheesier than I expected for 60$","Clock is very nice, although a little cheesier than expected for the 60 $ I paid for it..The only complaint I have..This was a Christmas gift for my Husband, and some idiot wrote on a piece of paper EXACTLY what it was, and taped it to the box...That ruined the whole idea, since he got the mail..Good thing he got it before someone else"
4,What I expected,Good product and got shipped very quickly! I am very happy with my product. I would order more products from this manufacturer. Thanks!
4,A good whacky screwball comedy,"Shows what might happen when one urban guy takes street crime too seriously after his brother gets killed by a mugger and drives his friends crazy by his obsession to correct things. Soon he becomes the murder victim of his enraged friend, and his friend, friend's wife and his own wife must cope with the situation. Bodies begin to pile up, some of them more than once in very fast paced mayhem."
3,Take Care - EDITING ERRORS,"This Bible is a fantastic idea, unfortunately not carried out with enough care by the publishers. After only a few months with my 2007 leather bound version, I've already discovered 5 editing/printing errors. For instance Eph 1:23, ""which is his body"" has been rendered ""what is his body"". Also Jer 7:22, ""nor commanded them"" has been printed as ""not commanded them"".Very disappointing for such an expensive Bible. I tried to contact Mathis publishers, but emails just bounce back.The above notwithstanding, if I knew that previous versions were error free, I'd buy one."
5,so cool!!!!!!,it was here in TWO DAYS with express shipping this head is so cool just like the picture but a little bigger the hair is rooted in the middle long like a mohalk and has bangs nice thick rubber long string on top the head it looks so cool in my car its going to last forever thats how well its made great buy well worth it!!!!!!!!!
3,Bought for Halloween,"It came as described, but looked very plastic. The hair was thinner than appeared in the photo. Shipping was very fast. I still used it, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Car Charger,"The charger appears to be well made. It does not look like a cheap imitation. As far as performance goes, I've only used this charger a few times on one long road trip to charge a Samsung SGH-A707 cell phone battery, and so far had no problems with it. So with this limited usage it's hard to tell what the charger lifetime and reliability will be, but so far so good."
1,Did not work,Did not when when arrived. The item shipped on time but does not work. Looks like a real Samsung product but would not work.
5,works great,"a+ works as advertised, have been using it for several months now with no problems, no complaints from me, pick this up if you need it."
3,Mediocre,"This is by far not one of The Hip's best work. In fact, it doesn't even come close. They have lost their edginess for this album. Gordon Downie's poetry is still great here, the music is just too soft. It's almost difficult to listen to the whole album because of it's tonal boringness. I'd have to say about half the songs are pretty good, but the other half are a pain to listen to. If it wasn't for songs like ""700 Ft. Ceiling"", ""Ahead By A Century"", or ""Gift Shop"", this album would be at the one star rating. I'd have to say this is probably The Hip's worst album."
5,Essential Hip,"If you buy only one Hip disk, make it this one. Although, once you buy this one, you'll want more. The best way to listen is straight through, preferably on a long car trip. This disk ranks up there with DMB's ""Under the Table and Dreaming"" in my book."
4,Fascinating repertoire and convincing performance,"I was drawn to this recording by the CD of Schütz which Ensemble Akademia made with Jean Tubery and La Fenice (Pierre Verany). This is a fascinating disc of the Requiem which Cavalli composed for his own funeral. Although worlds away from the extravagance of Monteverdi's Vespers, this requiem blends elements of old and new with considerable virtuosity. The choral sound is warm, often dramatic and nearly always in tune; the minor errors of tuning are forgiveable in the face of the committment which the group brings to this music. The disc is rounded out with the four Marian antiphon settings from Cavalli's Musiche Sacre. I was particularly impressed by the very subtle connections which bind these antiphons to the Requiem; the pairing of these works seems entirely natural."
3,Good read,I enjoyed this book. The characters were developed well and the story was entertaining. I think reading this prior to seeing the movie would have made it more chilling. I was a little disappointed with the ending but overall it was a good read.
3,The Book Doesn't Have As Much Bite As The Movie,"This is one of the rare instances where the movie is actually better than the book. The book lacks the excitement of the movie, but it does center more on the relationship of chief of police Frank Brody and his wife Ellen, who's going through a mid-life crisis. The whole dynamic, especially with ichthyologist Matt Hooper, is far different than the film.The main problem with the book is while the Frank and Ellen are fairly well fleshed-out as characters, their children are more or less treated as if they are stage props, with no real inner life or characterization.The book is fine, but if you have seen the film, it may be a bit disappointing. That said, there is still plenty of unsettling drama and it doesn't exactly incite one to go take a dip in the ocean after reading it. It is a good, fast read and is worth buying if you have an extra day or two on your hands and can deal with the limitations I've outlined."
4,"Great to have in hardcover, but....","I've wanted JAWS in hardcover for years, and only found beat-up, used editions available or very expensive ones in fair condition. Now it's great to have the classic novel in hardcover from Random House. It's handsomely done, with quality paper and a great dust jacket. However, call me a purist, but I wish they'd used the original cover art instead of the movie art and that SPECIALLY PRICED AT $15.95 is not a removeable sticker, but is part of the jacket. Kind of cheapens the whole effect. But the book also features an intro by Peter Benchley which is cool and, overall, I am very pleased to have it back in hardcover. You'd be surprised what a great surprise gift it is to fans of the movie, too. Thanks to Random House!"
2,Movie is MUCH better,"This book drags too much and the ending is a little sketchy. The shark isn't mentioned enough and what the reader gets instead is long overdrawn scenes with characters they don't care about and storylines that generally dissolve too quickly to notice. Rent the movie, it's much better- and cheaper."
2,Movie-Good Book-Bad,"I consider myself to be one of the biggest fans of the jaws movie, and was interested to see how the book differed. This book is very dull and contains the smut of a Paul Verhoven (director of basic instinct) movie. This book is as dull and confusing as a Mia Angelo poem. Do not bother trying to understand this book-it's like wallpaper-YOU CAN'T GET A READ ON IT!!!!"
4,JAWS is a great story leading to a horrid ending.,I got really into the main body which built up to the truly boring and unbelievable ending.
3,Harmless Fiction,"This will never be a challenge to the better, meatier books. It's fluff, summer reading, nothing much to make the reader think. yes it has some violence but it is not as scary or bloody as the Freddy or Halloween series not to mention Texas Chainsaw Massacre(any version)and of course it's dated. We know so much more about ""the fish"", the Great Whites than we did back in the 70s. If the Discovery Channel documentary on the book/movie is to be believed it sparked a whole new discipline of marine biology. Every male wanted to be like Hooper the fish specialist or Quint the fisherman who wanted to get that shark.There is a minor back story of Hooper sleeping with the sheriff's wife but it is only a minor distraction.It was a fun read, nothing more, nothing less."
2,The exception that proves the rule.,"If you are like me and loved the movie and were hoping to get a more fleshed-out version from the book you will be sadly disappointed. All I can say is Spielberg did a hell of a job if this is what he had to work with. The book has NONE of the magic from the film. I was hard-pressed to find anyone to like in the story and found myself rooting for the shark to hurry up and eat EVERYONE. There was nothing likable about anyone, no clever back and forth oneupmanship between Quint and Hooper, no Quint charm with his off-color songs or catch phrases, no real suspense or climax, ridiculous plot tangents involving love stories and organized crime. Pages and pages of filler that had nothing to do with anything. This is a glowing example of the exception that proves the rule that the book is always better than the movie. Skip this and pop the movie in again instead."
3,Well-Plotted But Predictable,"I read this novel when it was first published, and while I enjoyed the plot and kept turning the pages to see what the shark would do next, I also felt that what the characters would do and what would happen to them was predictable. The only unpredictable element was the shark, and that part was totally enjoyable!"
3,Less than expected,"Well, maybe cause I am such a huge fan of this movie is why I didn't love this book. It is drastically different from the movie. The relationship between Hooper and Ellen Brody was a surprise, and not one I particularly liked. I actually didn't like her character in the book much at all. The town leaders all seem a little more evil, wanting to keep the beaches open NO MATTER WHAT! You see a little of this in the movie, but not the mob connections! I liked this book, but was not entirely pleased with it. I understand changes for a movie, but usually the book is better than the movie! I guess we have Spielberg and John Williams to thank for that!"
3,The movie was so much better,"After I bought the Jaws DVD I had this obsession with finding the the book.My library, and all the town bookstairs didn't have. But eventually I found it on the net, and I discovered that it would have been better If I'd bought something else.I'll admit, the book was good, but not for why you love the movie.The book's few similarities to the film are basically names, and two of the attacks.Difference's are many, Brody's wife has an affair, Quint drowns instead of getting eaten, Hooper dies, and the shark asphyxiates instead of blowing up.Good book with much more exciting movie."
1,"The movie should win an award,the ""Better Than the Novel it was Based on"" award!","When I saw the movie when I was ten I was fascinated by it. Then I saw the book by Peter Benchley at the library and thought, ""maybe the book is as good as the movie!"" Boy was I wrong! Instead I got (Spoilers Ahead!) a over 300 page book about a Policeman who pretends there is no shark killing people, a fisherman who is completely drunk and insane, and a guy from the O.I.(Oceanographic Institute) who does something very bad (and sexual) with Brody's wife. I mean it seemed like (no offense) the shark was the smartest character in the book. Thank you Steven Spielberg for editing out the sexual scene in the book. I should have looked at these reviews before reading it."
3,Good Book...Graet Movie,"Let me first start off announcing that JAWS is my favorite movie of all time. I saw the move at leat 50 times BEFORE I decided to pick up the book. If you are not a diehard JAWS (the movie) fan, then this book is not for you. However, if you love the flick, then this book is a MUST read. Believe me, you will not be blown away by this novel, but it is a good read, and has some very shocking plot twists which were not included in the film. However, the book was often times dull, and you found youself thinking ""enough of this crap! Bring on the shark!"" , but, for those parts when it was man vs. beast, the book was quite exciting. One final thought....after reading JAWS, you will appreciate how amazing the performences in the film were. Most notably Robert Shaw as Quint. He turned a dull character, into one of the most remembered characters in the history of the movies."
2,"Horrible Writing, lame Ending","I can't believe that people gave this book more than 2 stars. The only reason this book was popular was because the movie was based on it. If Jaws the movie had never been made, Peter Benchley's book would not have sold more than five copies. The writing is terrible, the affair between Hooper and Ellen doesn't make any sense and the ending is rushed and unimaginative. Don't bother reading this book, just stick to the movie and enjoy the legend of Jaws. If you do read this book, you'll be hard pressed to figure-out how Spielberg was able to create what he did on film. If this book was the inspiration, Spielberg really must be a genius."
1,not even the shark itself could digest this,"i am a huge fan of ""Jaws"" the movie and i had seen it many times before i decided i wanted to read the book. i was told it was a ""horrifying read, perfect for afternoons spent on the beach."" for lack of a better word, i was disappointed. this book, as usually is the case, is different than the movie and im surprised something so wonderful on film could be concocted from these pages. steven spielberg is truly a master in his line of work to make this book into something so great.do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf. instead, get to your local video store as soon as possible."
1,Not as good as the movie.,"It was alright at first, then went completely downhill. A good half of this book was about some small town drama, with the shark being near non-existent. The ending was lackluster as well. It was horribly disappointing and I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Fallible memory?,"I first read ""Jaws"" back in 1974 before the movie came out. Maybe it is just my fallible memory but I recall that book having much more detail than the ""Jaws"" I am reading now. Reading the book in the 70's built an excitement about the movie. I recently purchased a 278 page ""Jaws"" that isn't even an inch thick. Is it my fallible memory or has ""Jaws"" lost a huge number of pages over time? If anyone has an original 1970's copy of ""Jaws"" I would appreciate any help you could give me on this. By the way, the movie by far is better than the book I just purchased."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I was deeply disapointed by this book. I have seen the movie and it is much better. This book is very wrong and gives sharks a negative picture. Sharks are very rarely known to eat humans, in fact, you are more at risk of getting struck by lightning than by getting eaten by a shark. When sharks do attack humans it is mostly because they have been confused and have mistaken you for other prey. This is why after the shark bites it usually swims away.When people look at the cover of the book, they might think that it will be about a shark who goes on a killing rampage, but the book is not mainly about the shark, most of it is about a lady who wants to get sexually involved (for some unknown reason) to a man other than her husband. This takes away from the excitement and is very boring to read. The conclusion is also very bad because it doesn't end with a sense of finality. It just ends when the shark eats a man and another man that was on the boat with him swims to shore."
2,Jaw's a dispointment,I didn't buy this book off Amazon I bought it at the local barnes in nobles but non the less I feel I should warn you about this horendous book.The book has very few deaths compared to the movie and centeres around the people more.The cheif is a bitter middle aged man who bitches about his wife and her anoying yuppie background.The wife is an insecure and what she feels under aapreciated wife she has an afair with cooper who is a yuppie marin biologist unlike in the moviewheres kinda of a nerdy hippie.The old shark hunter guy is pretty cool hes about the same.the mayor has a sub plot with some mafia people and that takes up some of the story.I felt it was more about the people than the actual shark eating people mind you this was peter benchleys first book.Also the death of the shark isnt as exciting as in the movie where it gets blown up.
4,Jaws Review,"Jaws is a book about a small town who is terrorized by a great white shark and the path they go through to get rid of it. This book has adventure and excitement. If you enjoy books on sharks and sailing/boating than this book is the one for you. Yet, with strong language, it might not be appropriate for younger kids. It's interesting not only reading the book, but also having seen the movie. There are several differences between the two. A little over halfway through the book it tends to slow down and seems to take awhile to get going again. There are a few graphic points in the book when describing shark attacks. I found the ending to be a bit confusing because of some of the sailing terms used. I would recommend reading this book."
4,A Rare Exception...,"Usually the book is much better than the movie... This isnt quite so than with this book. This book is good, really good in fact, but it is very different than the movie. The ending isnt even close to the movies and the story driving the charaters isnt either. That being said, once i got into the book as it is i was really hooked. The outline is Still Cheif Brody, Hooper, and Quint doing their thing to stop the large shark from doing hers...It was just like realing a story about a shark in a parallel universe with the characters i loved from the movie... (who could ever forget Robert Shaw as Quint? may he RIP...)I certainly suggest getting this book if you like page turners, just dont expect the movie to have been accurate... the only real similarity is that they are both exciting and will keep you out of the water..."
2,The movie is way better.,For one thing the book has so much bad language. Even though the book can get quite exciting at times it still can not compare with the movie.I also like the idea of Brody and hooper being friends in the movie instead of enemies like in the book.I also think that Hooper didn't need to die when he was in the shark cage.
3,A great book. Not for the weak hearted!,Supurb! One of the best books I've ever read! a must for any fan of scary movies or books. Splendid!
3,Good Book...BETTER movie,"Jaws has its high points. For instance, the shark attacks are worth reading. Overall, it seems to move too quickly with an abrupt ending. The movie was far superior."
3,Jaws,"Yes, ive sunk to a new level.... I actually read Jaws. I do have to admit that it really was not that poorly written. I found some parts a bit unecessary and rather over played, but all and all, it was not the worst thing I have ever read. The movie follows it pretty closely, but the book focuses more on the whole love and finding oneself theme instead of actually the shark itself. There is a small, interesting lesson that it tries to teach about the danger of obsessions."
3,The movie was better than the book,"Sometimes when I see a great movie, I just HAVE to read the book. You know the old saying,""The book is always better than the movie."" Amazingly, this is the only time I thought it was the opposite.As it happens, the movie and the book are totally differant! The book is almost entirely from the sharks point of view. I found it rather hard to relate to a shark, to be honest.The characters in the book did have more depth than they did in the movie. I liked the fact that Chief Brody's wife had an affair. She played a much bigger roll in the scheme of this story.All I have to say is, if you are picking up the book because you loved the movie, as I did, you are in for a let down. But Benchley does write a good story, none the less, and Jaws is worth a read. But if I can make a suggestion, read Beast instead. I just think it's a much better book."
2,"Brilliant Movie, pretty bad book.","Jaws is my favorite movie. I love everything about the movie, but most of all I love the characters. I found when I read the book I did not recognize a single character. The book is almost nothing like the movie. The film makers took the basic premise of the book, and created something different and vastly superior. There is not a single likable or well developed character in the book. The most upsetting character is Martin Brody. The character is such a moronic lunkhead he actually come off as mentally challenged. In the book the shark is secondary. More time is paid to the longings of Ellen Brody and her affair with Matt Hooper, which goes no where and has no payoff. One insightful moment is we learn from Ellen Brody ""that every little girl dreams of being a prostitute"". If you love the movie I can tell you there is no need to read this book. Don't give up on Peter Benchley though, I did very much enjoy his other works. I feel this was his worst book."
5,Better than the movie,I bought this for my husband and he loved it! He hadn't read it in many years and was so glad to reread it--he agrees that it is much better than then movie (but the movie is also a great classic).
3,Stick To The Premise Of The Story,"Peter Benchley is a decent writer when he stays focused on the story of a very large male Great White Shark menacing a New England summer resort community. He fails when he strays into an illicit affair between Ellen and Hooper; and when Mayor Larry Vaughan has a breakdown with his mafia connections. Okay - I can forgive the mafia sub-plot because it is an effect of the shark’s presence, but the affair sub-plot has no place whatsoever. Why distract from telling such a great story with an affair? It almost read like a cheap, explicit romantic novel in these parts. Why, is a question for the ages as Benchley has passed from this world, but it is these distractions that turned greatness into a pile of mediocre. In fact if it wasn't for Spielberg's film, this book would be an out-of-print collector’s item. Benchley owed Steven a lot for keeping the Jaws story alive."
2,"The shark rules, Jaws bites","I read Creature. Ive seen Jaws the movie. Ive even ridden Jaws:The Ride at Universal studios. After those experiences, I thought Jaws would be the movie, plus more intensity, more character development, and less standard horror movie characters. What I found is more like an exploratory essay on greed, fear, and adultry. If the movie had nothing to do with the book (and if the book had a better ending) I would have enjoyed it much more thouroughly. As it is, it left me wanting more... much more. Benchley needs a sequel just to improve upon the characters and what happens to the town."
1,No Bite in Jaws,"I liked the movie, so I chose to read the book. The first couple pages were OKAY, But the rest of the book was so boring, I barly finshed it. After reading 309 Pages the ending is a real downer! There was a huge boring love triangle with the 3 main characters and way to much love! but if you love the book, good for you, but I don't. Although, I love the movie."
2,Very disappointing,"I am very disappointed with this book. I love the movie and I thought the book would have the same story with more details. But it isn't so. I'd like to know more about the shark and its impact on the city but a large part of the book is devoted to Ellen Brody and her social problems. I couldn't even finish it. Maybe it's not that bad but if you expect something similar to the movie, you will be certainly disappointed."
4,Man Eater,"MAN EATERI'm reading the book ""JAWS"" by Peter Benchley. It all starts at with a man and a woman at a beach house. There was a party and they were having fun drinking and talking. They decided to go out to go out to the water for a night swim. The man didn't really want to go swimming because he knew he was to drunk so he would sit on the beach and wait for her to come back. So the woman went swimming but as she went the man fell asleep. When he awoke he saw that it was day now and the girls cloths were still next to him. He didn't think she would leave without him knowing and why would she leave here cloths behind. So he called the police about a missing woman. You will have to read this book if you want to find out what happened to the women."
3,A PRETTY GOOD READ BUT KINDA BORING,"This was a really good suspencful book. It grabs you from the opening chapter, but then when getting to the middle, they drop the shark plot for a few chapters and go into kinda boring and really stupid subplots. Some of the plots include deep sexual content and really bad language. After a while it does pick up and the suspence does come back. The movie is much much better though. It is a good read a deserves praise, but could have used a lot of work. A better Peter Benchely book is White Shark which doesn't have a dull moment and makes the shark from Jaws look like a pet goldfish."
1,I vote for the movie!!!!,"For years I have read books that are eventually turned into movies and I am usually disappointed in the movie. But in this case I have to say I am more disappointed in the book version. Benchley's characters are hard to like. The only character I liked was Hendricks and he wasn't a major character! The book seemed to be more focused on the rich vs. poor theme then the shark. The whole book seemed to revolve around Ellen Brody's character and the mayor's business partners. Who cares! Half way through the book I wanted all the characters to get eaten!! After finally reaching the end of this whine-fest I could not believe the totally stupid ending! Unbelievable! I felt cheated! I would like to thank Steven Speilberg for turning the miserable book into something incredible. See the movie, forget the book!"
3,Awesome Movie... not so great soundtrack,"I am kinda bummed about this soundtrack. I love the movie and the songs are amazing but instead of just taking the Steel Dragon songs how they sound in the movie they decided to try to make them I guess ""better"". They added a lot of that studio and fake sounding add ins that completely ruin the original sound that the songs had. It has lost that raw sound that made it so great. I would say save the money and just watch the movie, but if they ever release the songs how they sounded in the movie I would buy that."
2,Rock Star - a decent soundtrack,"Rock Star is a very underrated movie that I can see over and over again. The soundtrack isn't as great, even though I do enjoy hearing the songs from the movie. What I realized, again, is that the songs generally don't have enough power to last longer than what's shown in the movie, which probably is natural. My favorite tracks are, apart from Bon Jovi's ""Livin' On a Prayer,"" Steel Dragon's ""We All Die Young"" and ""Blood Pollution."" I miss the rap track from Steel Dragon's ""next album."" All in all, a decent - alas not great - soundtrack."
4,Cool music,"Half of the music on this CD you can find elsewhere, the other half is music by the ""fictional"" band Steel Dragon. Fictional or not, Zakk, Jeff, Jason and a host of others did create some nice new music here. I-Tunes never carried it, so I'm glad I came here to purchase it."
4,reliving rockstar,A fun movie (who didn't want to be a rock star as a kid?) with great catchy tunes. The recording is good and all in my family are enjoying it. Recommended.
2,"TALKING HEADS: ""Once in a Lifetime""","The song ""Once in a lifetime"" is featured in the movie and not on the soundtrack. This is very disappointing to leave out such a classic rock song."
2,A MUST HAVE,"I must say that this soundtrack is kick-A**. Being someone who lived the 80's lifestyle, groupie and all, the music and the movie were dead on. This is a must have for anyone who loves everything about the 80's. LONG LIVE HAIR BANDS!!"
4,"More of a hair toss than a head bang, but still worth it...","If you started out as a big fan of the movie score, simply couldn't get enough of the tunes, and bought the soundtrack, you might feel that the Aqua Net hairspray just didn't hold it together as well. In the immortal words of Cutty ""do you think you could make it just a little more rauchy?"" From movie to soundtrack some Dragon tunes fell from a squeal to a ping. Blood Pollution and Wasted Generation both retain their bollocks and you feel them shake the plastered layer of mascara off your lashes. I'd also ax the Everclear, INXS, etc. songs and replace them with AC/DC and Def Leppard, agreeing with Andy from Pitt below. That said, I still can't stop listening to the soundtrack. Steel Dragon was carved out of solid ROCK, baby. I'd sell my favorite KISS t-shirt to get to that show."
5,Awesome Work,"this album is crazy , it has everything , from kiss to ted nugent and without mentioning the great work of zack wylde"
4,Steelheart CD,I really liked this CD! I saw the movie and fell in love with Steeldragon/Steelheart music. The CD lived up to and exceeded my expectations.
3,Wanted Mark Wahlberg,"Even tho this soundtrack is good, I EXPECTED & WANTED Mark Wahlberg to be singing in it. He's the 1 who's in the movie, so why isn't he on the soundtrack, hmmmm??? I loved the movie & Mark & Jennifer in it. I've watched it over & over. If I already didn't have it on DVD, on buy it in a 2nd!!!! I recognized Zaak right away. Ozzy's guitar player. Did a great job!!!"
4,a must-have for any 80's child,"This is a great movie and this cd is a must-have for any 80's child.I bought the soundtrack, but was disappointed when I saw that Def Leppard's ""Let's Get Rocked"" wasn't on the soundtrack. Why didn't it make the cut?!?!Vivian Campbell used to be in the crowd looking up at the band and wishing that he could be in the band and now he's up on stage and playing and singing with the band.If Def Leppard would have made the cut, I'd have no reason not to give the cd 5 out of 5 stars. Oh well. Can't win them all I guess."
4,Fine CD,"Yes, it's extremely well done and I would recommend it highly.However, to say that this group is the best baroque ensemble is stretching it, to say the least. They have fine technique, but I've found other groups such as : Il Giardino Armonica, Rare Fruits Council, Europa Galante, Palladian, Florigellum, to be just as good if not better."
3,"excellent recording, some mediocre content",The playing on this CD is excellent and the recording quality is fine. Some of the pieces are less interesting in terms of their composition in my opinion however. The later pieces on this disc with a more prominent solo instrument are perhaps the best here. If you are exploring baroque era music and are looking to try out Telemann you might consider his fantasias for solo violin or some of his excellent cantatas as a better place to start. He wrote some good table music as well.
3,Minor keyboardings,"3 1/2Solo classical piano, restrained and romantic, perfect for late Sunday sessions, but possessing the background-intense, sketch-like qualities that make it seldom used."
1,What a waste! Simply a garbage!,It is totally wasteful. After a month or two I usually clean the filter cartridge.This bio bag is unable to be reused. It simply tears apart after I rinse it off touse it again. This maybe the only brand that makes you buy cartridges over and over.
5,Scattered Dreams,"Great drama....McRaney and Tyne Daly...great combination..McRaney is one the most underrated actors alive.LOOKING FOR A COPY OF THE ""MAJOR DAD"" TV show....Amazon.com....you don't have it....Why?"
5,The 4th Edition Is Completely Updated With The Latest In The Law,""".....Business Buyout Agreements walks you through the creation of your own legal agreement,which is included on CD-ROM.It provides all the tax and legal information you need at every step,such as how to structure the agreement to avoid estate taxes.THE 4TH EDITION IS COMPLETELY UPDATED WITH THE LATEST IN THE LAW.....""[from the back cover of book]"
4,Pretty basic information regarding buy outs; ideal for business owners,"This is a pretty basic book. Still it provides good information regarding the issues that business owners will encounter when partnering or joining with others to operate the business. The tax and valuation information is limited and those relying on self-help should consider retaining a qualified business valuation professional to run through the scenarios. Attorneys using this book, should likewise do the above."
2,way to BIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!,"ordered a 3XLT and it waS WAY TO bIG- I'm 6-4, 265 lbs- COULD FIT 2 OF ME IN IT - SO LONG IT ALMOST GOES TO MY KNEES. mY FAULT BUT i WON'T ORDER AGAIN FROM Amazon."
1,Russell sweatshirts,"I have ordered Russell sweatshirts before, and have some that are many years old and never had a problem. I bought these two for my husband for Christmas. The first time I washed them, they became a small, and not even a tall small. He cannot wear them. The sleeves are four inches too short, and the body is four inches too short. That is why I ordered Tall! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
3,Tall sweatshirt for the very tall!,"My husband is very long waisted and is 6'2"" tall. I ordered the 2XLT sweatshirt and the width is ample, but the length is very, very long. I honestly didn't think we'd ever find a sweatshirt too long for my husband, but we did in this one. Of course, since we wanted it to shrink, the shrinkage was minimal!"
2,too long,Heaviness and quality of this sweatshirt is good but if you are not 7' tallyou will find it too long. I am 6'3 and I ordered LT and it looks ridiculously long on me. I wouldn't buy again.
1,Not Fit for the Borgnine,"There are plenty of us burly folks with thick necks and a muscle or two, who do not want to feel squeezed in our attire. This ungenerous sweatshirt is composed of thin fabric cinched on top by a too-tight neck. I should have read David Marvin's true and informative 1-star review. This is over-priced for the low quality. I've bought thicker, better quality sweatshirts from WalMart. That's how cheaply made this thing is. I can't tolerate a tight neck pulling on me all day like a rabid dachshund; totally uncomfortable to say the least. As the group Little Big Town sings on their CDThe Reason Why, ""There's a price for keeping me, I may be cheap, but I ain't free..."" This cheap fuzzy offering in larger sizes (2x, etc.) turned out better:Soffe Men's Classic Crew Neck Sweatshirt."
2,I hate logos!,"OK, the shirts are a great buy, but I can't stand wearing anything with a logo on it and the ""R"" embroidered on the cuff means they all go back.They are an excellent buy, although one of the four shirts I got seemed smaller than the others. These are not what I would call heavyweight shirts."
2,Sweatshirt Review,The sweatshirt was a lot thinner than I expected. I thought paying a medium high price that it would have been better quality. I was very disappointed.
4,Excellent for those who are learning...,"This book is excellent for those who are learning a number of things. Forinstance, it's an excellent starting point for those interested in transgender issues in society. It isn't only that though. It does make one look inside him/herself & find what made them the person that they are...what impacts or influences created the being he/she has become. Jennifer does an incredible job of letting the reader tag along on her journey of finding one's self. At times, the book does seem to have a ""rose-colored glasses"" view of the struggle one faces, but overall, an amazing account."
5,An absoutely beautiful story,"I LOVED this book. The story of James's transformation into Jenny was riveting and beautifully told, but what moved me most was the unconditional love shown to Jenny by most of her friends and family. Though they found her condition difficult if not impossible to understand, they remained loyal to and supportive of the ""inner"" person whom they loved. In many ways they can be seen as even more courageous than Jenny, and I think on this point she would probably agree."
2,strangly impersonal,"There is something wrong with this account of Finney Boylan's experience of going from not even able to admit his secret to biologically becoming a woman. Maybe because s/he's a Professional Writer s/he can hardly let such a rare life experience go unexamined, unwritten about, s/he has written a book about a deeply personal life experience in the most superficial way possible. It's quite banal, and as a result, boring. The correspondence between Richard Russo and Finney is transcribed, almost as if to show just how clever the emails between Professional Writers can be, and maybe holds the ulterior motive of pulling in fans of the far more successful Russo. This book seems very calculated, as if maybe this is an effort towards a Pulitzer like Russo's and of which Boylan is so transparently evious."
2,"Provactive, Beautiful, and educational","This book is simply amazing. I loved it. It is exquisitely provactive and moving. Jenny keeps me laughing with her talented and humorous writing. I couldn't get enough. I learned so much about changing genders, family, and my own views and oppinions. This is a must read."
2,Well written but disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book but ultimately was unable. I've known many transgender people and none have witnessed the world travelling, money-no-issue lifestyle that Ms. Boylan has 'lived'.Sorry to say it but this reads more like a fictional fantasy than fact."
5,A Great Book & A Great Live Interview On Larry King May 25,Jennifer gives the reader the best look ever into the transgender condition and all of the many challenges that the person and his/her family have to face. Jennifer puts a very hopeful face on this condition and available resolutions. She is also blessed with a wonderful life partner who has stood with her. The live interview on Larry King was heartwarming as well as educational. All transcripts of Larry King shows are available online at no charge for those readers who are interested.
2,Hard to Follow,While I appreciate the courage it must have taken the author to write this story of her life I found this book difficult to follow. It jumps around in time which in this particular case made it difficult for me to really gain a sense of what the author's journey entailed. If you are looking for a book that reads like a story versus an informative resource on transgendered individuals then this might be for you. Personally I was hoping for more of the latter.
4,Refreshing and eye opening,"Boylan's memoir opens a dialog not only around transgendered issues, but for conversation about anyone who's ever felt isolated, like they didn't belong in their own skin. Recommend to just about anyone!"
2,Lacking in Candor and Poorly Written,"For an English professor, this is a poorly written memoir of a man's transition to a woman. It is sprinkled with lengthy conversations that seem contrived at best. The author is supposedly a writer of humorous novels, but this work contained very little. Most puzzling at all is the lip service the author gave to the agony and confusion that he inflicted upon his family and friends. A father of two boys, he displayed very little sorrow over what this could all mean for his children. His wife's (and his mother's) eventual complacency was the most bewildering. Any normal wife would be dumbstruck with seething rage. Apparently his transition was mostly a big group hug."
2,Does not look like Mickey,"This chocolate mold does not look like Mickey Mouse. If I had seen it in the store, I never would have baught it. It resembles Mickey, but the features are not distinct enough to call it a ""Mickey"" Mouse Chocolate Mold."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"Be careful, I bought some molds for a Christmas gift, they were supposed to ship a week before Christmas, it has been over a month and I haven't heard anything. They have terrible customer service, and are rude."
2,Mickey Lolly mold,It was very difficult to color the features inside the mold. Had to paint them after the lollies were molded.
2,"It is a mouse, but it is not MICKEY","I thought these would be great for a Mickey Mouse themed party I recently catered. However, the product is not a Disney product and from experience unless something has Disney's seal on it, you are not getting the real deal.If you just want a mouse mold its fine - but if someone is requesting Mickey Mouse - then go with Disney products."
3,It's okay...,"Typical cheap candy mold, does not show details very well. It will work just fine for simple projects, but more than likely will be tossed after a few uses. Good for the price, but not for professional use."
2,A big disappointment,"I too bought this book because it had Richard Wright as the author. I read with great appreciation his Native Son a long time ago, and just recently read Black Boy and found it very attetion-holding. Savage Holiday is ridiculously plotted and the central character is extremely annoying. The long account of his running around naked in his apartment house was irritating and frustrating to me. All he had to do was hold his newspaper in front of himself and go to an apartment and tell what happened and the manager could have been summoned so he could get in his apartment. I know, the guy was nuts, as we see as the story moves along, but I was very unenthused by this book. I can see why it was ignored by critics when it came out in 1954."
2,Just okay,"Very basic, and worth the price. This item is just okay, nothing more-nothing less. May have to use with other items."
2,CBS Soaps,This magazine is a weekly publication addressing events that will occur in the next week on the soaps. It is intended to inform you of coming events to improve the viewing experience. My issue with this publication is that it rarely is received by Friday and most often comes in the middle of the next week. Not likely to order this item again.
2,not worth bothering with,this magazine doesn't tell you much & the little bit it does has already happened so if you watch the show you already know
1,KINDLE PLEASE!!,I do not understand why this magazine is not available on Kindle. That is the only reason I wanted a Kindle Fire but now I guess I don't.
4,Very worthwhile buying,"This cd has the Pre Melotron version of Rhythm and Blues Alibi, not a remix really but more like an acoustic stripped back version of the song with wonderful harmonious vocals.ZYX is an odd song, has (?) singing with a voicebox and is a song with large parts of the alphabet sang backwards.Tijuanalaska like the other reviewer said is terrific. The last half of the song is mainly instrumental but 'heavier' than actual Tijuana Lady part of the song with an almost sad/moody feel to it, definately makes this release worth getting.It's worth getting as Tijuanalaska was not released on Five Men in a Hut making this the only way to get it."
4,A great rock-ording...every rock music fan should have it!,"A great rock band and Fully Completely is a terrific record to get! What ya got here is pounding rock tunes with attitude and cool lyrical flair. If yer lookin' for stadium, sell-out anthem rock, look elsewhere. The tragically Hip are going to be too cool for you. If you want good riffs, snarky-street lyrics with references to Canadian legends and rock tunes that make you wanna drink beer & kick it all night...just get this disc!"
5,Superb,"Without a doubt, one of the most underrated bands in the world. ""Fully Completely"" lends itself to both simplicity and complexity. The lyrics, which are sometimes disturbing, but always intriguing, never become awash among the myriad of powerful guitar and bass licks. This is just honest-to-goodness Rock and Roll. The way it was meant to be heard. The Tragically Hip are truly outstanding artists."
5,"The Hip will never lose class , NEVER!!!!!!!!!","Gordon Downie is a genious, a poet, as a songwriter is capable to create beautifull environtments , colorfull scenes , now every Hip lover knows that this band is the voice for the intelligent men , and this is refreshing and thats the reason why this canadians have become a cult name for certain eclectic audience, rythms this guys offer are so versatile , southern rock, alternative, folk, indie , pop, blues ,even sometimes hard , and maybe The Hip are not the first ones to put together all this influences , but they are one of the best on it.HM"
5,A definite must for Hip fans,"The Tragically Hip is the best and most profound band to hit the music scene in years. They've been putting out cds for almost 10 years now and have quite a large fanbase. Fully Completely is one of their earlier works, and although for me it is an impossible task to pinpoint the most outstanding Hip cd, if i had to, this would probably be it."
5,Canadian rockers give it to the people,"This is the 'must have' Tragically Hip album. Being a Scot, and having spent a considerable time in Canada I was able to see first hand what this album means to the people. The Hip as they are affectionately known in there native land write songs that express contemporary Canada and Fully Completely is a stand out in terms of breadth of style and pace. Personally the track with most resonance is 'Looking for a Place to Happen', which wonderfully summarizes anyone who is fed up with the same old bar hopping routine. Buy this album if you would like to learn more about Canadian culture, a nice wee bonus is the art work on the album cover pulls out to a nice size poster, which you can put on your wall, if you like - nice."
1,"only 2 good songs, the rest is just to fill the space","If you've heard Panthom Power, you'll be quite disappointed with this one. DON'T BUY THIS CD And who the hell cares where they are from! Music is what matters."
4,young art,"first off I'll get the title right,it is actually"" young art""and if you buy it in the U.K. on PROPER PAIRS what you will get is a 2 CD set with 40 titles...the first14 tracks are of pepper with kenton & shorty rogers and are of their type perfectly fine. the real gems are within the balance of the contents with hampton hawes and russ freeman etc.all in all a fine batch of material which illustrates pepper's increasing stature as the dates roll by from 1943 to 1953..LUVELY STUFF"
5,GREAT ADDITION TO MY LIBRARY,"The book came to me in very suprisingly great condition....Dust Jacket in tact, no torn pages and a tight binding. The seller shipped to me on time and the quality is awesome."
2,"Mixes Very Well, but Broke after a few uses","I often eat powdered diet food, like small shakes and protien packed puddings and such, and this mixed them wonderfully smooth... but the stick broke off after about a weeks worth of use. And since it's not a 2-piece gadget (I've seen some where you can remove the mixer stick), there was no way to fix it."
3,HE LOVES ME,"Kaitlyn (Natalie Zea) is working in the ER when they wheel in Allison (Angeline-Rose Troy) who has multiple stab wounds. For some reason they decide to zap her and Kaitlyn gets in the way. Kaitlyn believes Allison was conscience at the time and was trying to tell her who is the killer. She says, ""He loves me.""Kaitlyn gets various memory flashbacks and decides to investigate on her own. She meets Shep (Christopher Lloyd), an elderly tenet who knew Allison. She also decides to see Allison's shrink.The movie has that low budget made for TV plot, dialouge, and sound track. While you want to know who the killer is (it at least gives you more than one suspect) the film drags getting there. As I was about to fall asleep out of boredom, the film takes an unexpected turn.Natalie Zea did a nice job. Unfortunately the film moves too slow in the beginning for a good mystery/thrillerOne f-bomb (?), no nudity, dimly lit sex scene"
1,Very predictable movie,"Very limited suspense, everything is predictable. The ending left you a bit uncertain as to what actually happened. I would have preferred to have seen something else!"
2,Not very durable at all!,"I agree with the other reviewer, this is nothing more than a $20 plastic step stool, and a pretty pointless one at that since it barely elevates my son at all. He can't use it to step up and reach the potty, he can't even use it to stand and brush his teeth. I have to use a separate stool ( that only cost $4). The toilet seat fell apart after a day and can't be put back together completely. So it just sits on top of the rim, and I have to watch like a hawk to make sure my son is okay on it. The whole thing was a complete waste of money and I'm very disappointed. For the $20 you'll waste on this, you can get a more durable potty seat, a separate stool, a book about potty training, and a sheet of cool stickers they'll actually like."
2,Not worth it,"the potty seat was broke within a day, and the ""potty tips"" is only a few pages...then repeated in spanish. Amounts to no more then a $20 step stool."
2,"WARNING, SOUND GREAT BUT BUILT LIKE CRAP","I had a pair years ago, sounded great and built like a tank with Birch Plywood, Just got a pair and they are half the speaker they used to be, i.e. they still sound great, but they are built like crap using MDF and glue guns. Save your money and buy a speaker from a company that cares about build quality as much as they do sound. Also, dont buy the excuses that they use high quality MDF and it has tighter tolerances,better resins, blah-blah, crap material is crap material."
4,A letdown at the end.,"A wonderful storyline which, unfortunately, could also be true. You couldn't help but feel Snow's pain at her mother's deathbed confession, leaving Snow feeling that she has no identity at all. As Snow's search for her biological mother comes to a close, the mystery of the woman who raised her for the past 30 years is just starting to take hold. The author had a wonderful story going here until the end, when you are left hanging. I have never liked books that leave open storylines. Even if it is part of a series, or if there is going to be a sequel, each book should be self-contained and with completed storylines. I feel like I was left reading half a book. I do hope the author has plans to do a sequel and put closure to this."
5,Fabulous slippers,The Ugg slippers have to be the best and most comfortable slippers in the whole wide world. I have had them for 3 weeks now and they are still plush and soft as the day I pulled them out of their box. They will last a long time and are definitely worth the money!!!
2,Older ones - GREAT - Recent ones - POOR QUALITY,"I LOVE UGG - their snow boots and previously their slippers.Five or Six years ago I purchased my first pair of Coquette slippers - they are still intact but look faded and the inside wool has padded down - but they can still be worn. My one year old, latest purchase - now have a hole coming through the Big Toe area - and the suede leather looks so thin compared to the outer covering used on the ""old"" ones. Has the quality control gone down now that they are manufactured in China? I have tried to find a head office where I can send these back to ... Does anyone know of an address in California or in USA"
1,Also Disappointed,"A. Collins: I have had the same experience with my Uggs. The first pair lasted significantly longer than my second pair. They are now completely bald at the toes and heels after only a few months. Plus the price has shot up to $100 from $80 just a year or so ago. I cannot recommend them either. UGG had better re-think their slipper design, as they are about to lose customers, I'm afraid."
2,not that comfy,The lining is not as thick as other styles. They are hard. Theey are ok to run to the market or drop the kids off. They are not slippers
2,Stiff Sole,"I purchased a pair of these slippers 5 yrs. ago. They were wonderful, wore them to the store, walking my dog....everywhere. I read the reviews about the soles being stiff, not up to the quality you would expect from UGG's. Because I LOVED my old pair sooooo much, I purchased these anyway hoping the reviews were wrong. I should of listened. The price is up and the quality is way down, these will not last me as long as my old pair. I do not mind spending that kind of money on slippers if they last 5 yrs. They are too stiff, the sole is like a piece of hard plastic, they are hard to walk in. I would buy something else....I'm going to return them"
5,My wife loves these!,"My wife got a pair of these 3 years ago and wears them around the house and out to a few stores when she doesn't feel like getting dressed up too fancy. Needless to say, the insides have worn down and are not nearly as soft and fluffy as when they were first purchased. But that is to be expected if you ask me. I don't own a pair of shoes more than a year and expect them to look like they did on day 1!I just purchased these for my wifes birthday as a replacement to her old pair. I was very surprised how quickly they shipped and arrived at my house. The quality and condition of the shoes are perfect - no complaints at all. I actually forgot how soft and fluffy they look when they are new!I would recommend buying these for your girlfriend/wife - they are very comfortable and very nice!Thanks for reading! If you found this review to be helpful, please make sure to click the button below!"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered these to replace a pair of Ugg slippers I liked so much I wore them out. When the new slippers came I was disappointed, because the quality did not seem to be up to Ugg standards. The lining felt stiff and uneven, and there were tufts coming out. I returned those, but when the second pair came they weren't much better. I decided to keep them anyway, thinking maybe the lining would break in and they'd feel as comfortable as my old Uggs. Well, they never have. Within a few months the lining started to wear thin, and if I wear them very long the black dye starts turning my toes black. I used to think Uggs were high quality and worth the expense, but not any more."
1,Uncomfortable,"My husband bought these for me for Christmas, and while I love my other UGGs, these were most uncomfortable! The soles are like industrial boots and very stiff...they don't bend with your foot when you walk. Because they don't bend, they feel like they are slipping off. I have some from Target that are much more comfortable and way cheaper. I'll stick with the original...the boots!"
1,Uggs Degradation of Quality,"UGG Women's Coquette Slippers - I am on my second pair of UGGS Coquette. Two years ago, I purchased my first pair and wore them everyday. They held up very well. In fact, I replaced them because I had worn them so much, the outside was beginning to show their age. I replaced them with an identical pair and within WEEKS the heel area lost all of its fur. I purchased them through Zappos and they replaced with a new pair. Within weeks, I am experiencing the same problem - virtually no fur left in the heel area. I had also purchased 2 pair of the same style as gifts ---- and both pairs had the same issue almost immediately. I spent $300+ for inferior quality. I shall replace with one of UGGScompetitors that is less expensive. A word of advice to UGGS...once you lose a customer it is nearly impossible to win them back. BUYER BEWARE"
1,Not well constructed,"I received a pair as a gift in December and after only a few weeks the fur came up at the toes in one of the slippers leaving a very uncomfortable bare patch. Ugg customer service was kind enough to send me a new pair and this time the fur has come off in spots on both heels after only a few weeks. Also quite uncomfortable. Fortunately, Ugg customer service is sending me a refund and I'm going to get a different brand of shearling slippers.This construction is quite surprising to me as I own other Ugg shoes that I think are just fantastic and I wouldn't trade them for anything! (Oh, LOVE the boots in the Colorado winter!)"
2,Warm But Hard As Rocks,"These slippers are indeed rugged and very, very warm. However, after only 20 minutes of wear time they make my feet and ankles ache so badly because once your heels settle into the sheepskin it is like walking on bricks. There is zero shock absorption so if you have plantar fasciitis, weak ankles or spurs then these are not the slippers for you. For the money I expected more than just wool over hard rubber. An underlayer of memory foam or something could have made a world of difference. I won't be buying these again."
1,Will not last long,"After only 1 year of infrequent wear, the inside sole of the slipper has no fur left. All that's left underneath is a plasticky textured sole. I contacted the company about repairing, or replacing and they informed me that I could purchase their insoles and have them permanently stitched in by a cobbler myself, that this has worked for other customers...so clearly this is a problem with all of them. Not worth the money if you ask me which is sad because I really love my ugg boots and was expecting the same quality for the price."
5,"cozy, comfortable, durable","Had the first pair for about 4 years. I mainly used them inside as house shoes, but also outside running errands and on international travel. Just bought my second pair, since the fur on the first pair is pretty worn. I stayed with this style, since so versatile."
4,I Like It,"I got these UGG to see the big deal. They are nice, but I don't believe worth the price. I have other shoes that are less and more comfortable"
5,Ahhhhhhhh!,It's as if my feet have died and gone to heaven. My feet were always cold in the winter - not any more. I wear these slippers all the time. Love them!!!!!!!!!
1,Mosser's shoes,"There was a mix-up with my original order - I've sent the wrong order back but haven't heard anything from Mosser's shoes - they owe me a pair of Uggs Coquettes, chestnut color, size 8...Called them again today. I'm not particularly happy with this transaction confusion and wouldn't use this again - I'd just buy locally and avoid all the confusion."
1,the whole thing was a drag ...,i preface this by saying i already have 5 pairs of ugg coquette slippers which i adore BUT this transaction was a bummer ... they took forever to come & when they did they were defective (the logo patches were out of place) & there was a whole 'dog & pony' show return process with the vendor ... in the end i did not get my return shipping cost back (they said there was no defect - yeah right) & i ended up losing $12.00 with no slippers to show for it ... i do want to mention that amazon was wonderful but SHOES CENTRAL was not !
1,Rip Off,"I got the same exact thing at Target for $14.99! Don't be ripped off by these so called ""designers""!"
5,Fab,This is my second pair and love the new ones as much as the old. Great slippers! They wear really well and keep my feet super warm
5,Comfy and Warm,These are fluffy and warm. They are my favorite winter slippers. The soles are great because you can walk outside with them if you need to.
5,So Warm and Cozy!,I just recieved a pair of these for Christmas! They are adorable and extremely warm and cozy. I got them in chestnut which I reccomend because they go with everything! Great slippers
5,UGG Coquette Slippers,"I've had several pairs of UGG slippers and boots, and I love them! I replaced my chestnut-colored slippers from Amazon after I'd put about a million miles on my original pair. They're comfortable and durable; I wear them both around the house and when I'm out running errands. UGGS are the best!"
5,Love them.,Great quality. Super comfy! Bought these for my daughter and now I want a pair! I will be ordering them soon! Love the chocolate color.
4,UGG Australia womem's slippers from Amazon,"The slippers were to be a gift. They arrived very quickly, sooner than expected. The slippers were a hit at Christmas. The color we perfect and the fit was just as stated. Good Job Amazon!"
4,Women's Coquette UGG,Love 'em but they could be a bit more cushion when you walk. I wear them all the time.(It's winter)
5,Wear them all the time,"I just love these slippers bought some for my daughter and they just love them, all four of them!"
5,Super slippers,"Fantastic slippers. Well worth the money. The best I have ever had. Soft sheepskin for your feet yet strong exterior. Excellent, highly recommended."
3,FLEECE PROBLEM,"I'll begin by saying that these slippers are great....soooo comfortable and warm !However, I too, like other reviewers, am very disappointed that the fleece in theheel area wears down to the bare bottom in a matter of a few months.I believe for what these slippers cost, that UGG should either lower their price or remedy this common problem."
3,ugh for ugg,"One size is way too big, the next size is too small. There is no happy medium for sizing these things. My 8 1/2 wide foot found no happy compromise. The sheepskin felt really nice though, so I gave it 3 stars. Oh, and labels say that only the sheepskin is from Australia, but the slipper itself is made, well, you know where! ;)"
1,Didn't last one winter,"I received thee cozy and sturdy slippers as a gift late in the fall of 2008. They looked and felt great, but before the winter was over the heel part of the interior sole became completely worn out in both slippers. For the record, I am 5'7"", weigh under 120 lbs, and do not have an unusual gait. I was surprised that an Uggs product would wear out so fast. My last pair of shearling-lined slippers lasted over 15 years (wish I could remember the brand).I wear an 8.5 shoe, the size 9 slipper fit perfectly."
3,Tear Stain Pads,"These are the Free Clear Tear Stain Pads, not Eye Wash Pads or Miracle Care Eye Clear Cleaning Pads. They are the pads in a jar that you use to wipe the stains from underneath the eyes of a white dog and they work if you use them as directed, which is to wipe the areas once a day for a few days. The stains will disappear.I can't in good conscience give them 5 stars, which they deserve, because they came with a label that is misprinted, giving directions for a bottle of another product which could cause some people to misuse the product. I contacted Amazon and they immediately started to get to the bottom of the misprinted labels to get them corrected. They couldn't have been nicer and that's a big reason I keep shopping here.Anyway, if you have a white dog with tear stains, Tear Stain Pads work. I'm not familiar with any of the other Miracle Care products mentioned in my first sentence or in the product listing and can't comment on their use."
4,Ok,These are ok. I dont think that they are fantastic (could be a little wetter) but they get the job done eventually
1,"Terrible, buy assets tights instead","When I buy Wolford, I expect the control top to stay up and the tights to feel soft and luxurious. These roll down and feel rough on my skin. Not impressed. I could've gotten the same results - roll down and rough material - from assets tights at half the price."
4,"Well, it's big...","...and fun to flip through. And the section on computer science has a handy ASCII chart. Really, isn't getting this sort of spotty, high-level and often outdated scientific information exactly what the Internet is good for? (Do you know that the Internet ""has now grown to possibly 2 million host computers all over the world?"" - The NYPLSDR does.) If you think a random, off-line, walk through the science tree sounds like fun, get this book. I do and i did and i'm satisfied."
2,Don't believe everything you read,"While I love the concept of this book, my personal experience was that I flipped, more or less randomly, to four different pages and found errors on EVERY page. Perhaps that was just rotten luck, but it makes me suspicious of all the answers in the book. I think you'd be better off looking at a reference that's written by experts, rather than generalists. Buy a copy of the Encyclopedia Britannica CD-ROM."
4,Reuben knows her stuff,Shelly Reuben brings years of experience as a fire investigator to this book. She does a great job weaving the procedural details of an arson case into the story and keeping both moving along at a nice pace. I'd love to see more of Fritillary!
4,Much better,This tool is much better than the cheap little all-plastic version I bought at Lowes 3-4 years ago. This thing feels and works like an actual tool. The other thing's a piece of junk.
1,Didnt fit,This bulb was about 1mm too long and was too tight in the Zilla branded fixture so I am returning it.
1,Author's irrational hatred shatters his credibility...,"While there are some interesting tidbits, the author's hatred towards Oklahoma is so profound that he cannot be taken seriously by any open-minded reader. There is little doubt that the author approached this book with an anti-Oklahoma premise, and then collected unverified rumors to support his premise.Recently the author has posted on bulletin boards suggesting that Texans should threaten 18-year old kids with future employment discrimination should the kids decide to go to school in Oklahoma.The author has bizarre views, irrational hatred, and little credibility. His views are embarrassing to real Longhorn fans."
1,Not as objective as you think,"Interesting topic for football fans, but the Texas-bias is evident. It's too bad. This is a rivalry really worth exploring from an objective viewpoint."
4,"No Jokes! You, too, can have The Edge","I heard about this book on Howard Stern and it's very--NICE. It's POSSIBLY the CLEAREST book ever. I was best man at his wedding--despite the fact that he actually has a brother--at a charming little Italian Village. Some may say the book gets a litle ""hot and crusty,"" but I say, ""Listen, pal! He has a -- RIGHT -- to protest!"" He reduces the issue of ""Rory and the Hamburger"" to a lovely Chinese meal; the most difficult problems are no more than a ""sweet breakfast"" of the soul. He says don't cry over spilled milk--unless, of course, you're the one who spilled it, all over the table in a restaurant in New Hampshire. Again, the theme of New Hampshire: Most powerful are the book's tragicomic visions of a bufoonish man, running helplessly after a car, as he is mocked. Eventually, he throws a newspaper."
5,kansas city swinging at it's best,"Never mind the fact that Jay introduced the jazz world to Charlie Parker. His band rocked! After Basie,nobody swung like McShann. this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40's small band jump blues sides. Anything by this man is worth listening to. Another great disc by the Proper label, who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price. Highly recommended."
1,WATCH OUT!!! IT'S A PHONY!!,"This CD is purely remakes of the beloved songs, and BAD ones at that!!!(with the exception of ""playground in my mind""-it sounds almost like the original).Don't waste good money on this CD!! (unless you have no taste)"
4,Up and Coming... wicked,"Big name DJ? I can't stand when people will only listen to someone who has already carved out a name for him/herself. There are many DJs out there who are managing to revolutionize an industry that has been falling into strategies for success (read: Pop strategy - Britney is best example)Circuit sessions definitely are a genre of dance music, but Joe Bermudez is multifaceted and I liked getting this CD to be able to compare it against others I have. I've heard him in clubs, and respect the fact that while he still hasn't become a household name (yet) he isn't just a ""studio DJ"". He's amazing live! I was so impressed after seeing him spin at a DC club here that I started looking him up and found lots about him. He has his own website, and he's got samples on that, too.This is a great CD from a great DJ. Looking forward to the next one from him... :)"
2,same old stuff done better elsewhere,"...paying money for a CD of this nature is only acceptable when mixed by one of the ""Big Boys"". This risky venture features a virtually unknown DJ mixing mediocre, uninspiring 'circuit' (read: geared to the gay community) house tracks. Nothing any amateur DJ couldnt buy and mix himself and no 'stand out' hits you hope to find on a club CD. Id save my money for one of the many exceptional CD's out there from the likes of Rauhofer, Calderone and Tenaglia..."
3,Smart Move,"I am glad they were smart enough to drop a ""greatest hits"" even though they don't have any hits (mainstream wise)but they have plenty hood hits/anthems that got some play in the south. I never liked their whole albums but all the tight songs are on this one cd and it is worth every penny. Just listen to For The Good Times, Boys In Blue, Dot My Doe, Everyday Thang and On the Grind and u will buy it if you are into hardcore/gangsta rap. Hotep!!"
2,Dismal end to the Kristel trilogy,"This is the third and last of Kristel's Emmanuelle movies, but don't hold her responsible. The backer had run into censorship problems with the second movie, and wanted to make sure that didn't happen again. The result is a disappointing attempt at being serious. It completely lacks the warm mood and physicality of the two earlier efforts. Even the background music has a very different style, one that I found far less successful in framing the visuals and dialog.It tries to show Emmanuelle and husband Jean growing into a more stable, monogamous relationship. Instead, it just descends into petty jealousies and possessiveness. Jean, especially, pulls tricks that would have seemed silly even in high school. Perhaps the movie meant to show swelling affection and bruised feelings. Instead, it just showed swollen egos and bruised pride.//wiredweird"
4,"Decent conclusion to the ""original"" series w/Sylvia Kristel.","This video, is the third in the series, with the exotic, and erotic, Sylvia Kristel; who always had her voice dubbed I think, as I'm not sure if she could speak in English, but I could be wrong. It features her in a series of encounters; with and without her husband, but which were less revealing than the first two, as this was rated ""R"", as I don't think there's an ""unrated"" version of this one; but there are the first two. Anyway, she still looks great, sans clothes, and even though the dialogue is ""hokey"", and there's some ho-hum male nudity, just to make things ""equal"", she does a pretty good job of being the wife, the lover, and more. With some other mildly revealing bits, from the other actresses, it's ok. The three movies with her are the only ones really worth having, as the others, while featuring some fine naked females, are similar in ""name"" only."
3,I prefer the original recordings...,I went in thinking on getting all (or most of them) of Ennio's spaghetti film scores in one click. It does have a great selection but they are all remakes of the original and not what we listened on the movies. Keep looking for the original digitally remastered soundtracks. Much better and for sure the original stuff.
4,A good compilation,"I am not a folk music expert and I can't say how well the included titles represent folk music. But apart from that, I enjoyed the music. But the Celtic Folk CD -which was the primary reason that I bought this set- stayed below my expectations. It's maybe my fault, but I've taught of Celtic music more moving. But, it's the slowest one among other ones, English and American folk samples. Nevertheless, it's enjoying to listen these CD's."
2,A gem of banality,"Strauss once said, ""I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-rate seond-rate composer."" His masterpieces would ead you to believe that he was, indeed, first-rate. But he had the maddening haibt of composing pointlessly virtuosic, endlessly harmonized, almost slithery music that was worse than second-rate. Despite Sinopoli on the podium to give it the plantinum treatment, Joseph's Legend is aimless, banal, and never-ending. It doesn't come from the veyr bottom of Struass's barrel but it comes close."
3,"GOOD, but be careful","We use this product religiously for my fair, very sensitive skinned daughter. However, we cannot use it on her face at all!!! On a recent holiday my husband forgot and put this sunscreen on her face and it burnt her skin. The poor baby looked like something out of a horror movie as her face went from red raw to peeling off.I use the Neutrogena Baby SPF 60 sunscreen stick on her face...it is more of a physical barrier.If you have sensitive skin, do a patch test first (as they recommend) to see how your skin reacts."
2,"Doesn't last, we got burned!","I won't be buying this sunblock again and don't recommend it at all. After using a different brand all summer for my fair skinned 4 year old, I ran out and tried this. We were in and out of 75 degree sun for about 2.5 hours (she was not sweaty). She has a sunburn. Nothing major, but all summer long she has been outside with another brand and was still white as milk. So disappointed in this product. This is not very effective for sun protection. I will never buy it again. I give it 2 stars because the smell is unoffensive which is about the only plus."
1,Cracked top,"I enjoyed the convenience of ordering this product online, but the bottle came in with a cracked top. It really wasn't worth sending back...but of course it is not easy to use since the top is broken."
5,Merry Christmas From Miss Nancy Wilson!!,"I just received Nancy Wilson's latest release ""A Nancy Wilson Christmas"" that was recorded recently. With her unique brand of style, she has made each song her own. It's no wonder she is described as a song ""stylist"" for she demonstrates her interpretations flawlessly. She has chosen classic as well as contemporary tunes and delivers each with the elegance you've come to know and expect from this classiest of ladies! Miss Nancy will take you places you've never been!! Your Holiday collection will not be complete without this wonderful addition. Enjoy!"
1,Don't order this...,"I ordered this because for $1, these pre-order discs usually have some goodies on them, especially for the price, such as older installments of the series, etc.All this has in the box is a sheet of paper with a serial number and a website address to download a bonus character for the retail game.That's it.No, CD, no nothing.JUST A SHEET OF PAPER.Only get this if you need $1 to get to free shipping."
2,A little tooo detailed.,"If you're buying this as a textbook, you likely don't have a choice of whether to buy it or not - you're just looking for the best price. But let me tell you, this is not a fun book to read. It may be a great resource, but the chapters are very long, and sometimes filled with minutiae that makes the reading even harder to follow. I like my texts a little on the ""dry"" side with just the information needed to know, and little ""dialogue"" between reader and authors. This one has way too much dialogue and it wastes my time trying to get the core information. In a word, wordy. Me no likey."
5,Rebounder,"More durable than expected. Unlike the older models that didn't bounce very well, this one really is just like a full-size trampoline, just smaller for indoors. Very fun and easy to set-up and use. Great for a quick work-out."
3,Fast Way to Fitness-- WATCH OUT FOR INJURY,"Rebounders are a great way to fitness. This product is professional quality and worth every dime. I feel secure with a deep bounce and can do mini workouts at home when life doesn't allow the extra time for the gym. It's turbo workout! Try it! Although I was full of praise, now I know that you can really get hurt on this type of product. I read a woman's body with its wide hips isn't made to bounce and stretch in this way naturally. You can get severe injuries if you are not careful. So the warning isn't to stay away from this product, but just to make sure to take it slowly and to follow the rules to its use."
5,Best rebounder made,The quality of this rebounder is second to none. Very sturdy and solid feeling. The extra dollars are worth it for good old American quality.
5,Great Purchase After So Many Broken Rebounders,"I've bought so many $50 range rebounders from Sport Authority and others online, only to have them all break after a day or two of half-hour use. I kept thinking I was being too brutal with my rebounders and needed to jump gentler next time. Or I thought maybe I weighed too much for it(I'm 200 pounds). After totaling about 5 trampolines over months, I decided to cave in and try this Needak Rebounder.I didn't want to buy this trampoline because it costs so much. I really wish I would have just went along and bought this rebounder instead of wasting my money on the other ones. This rebounder is what I call an investment. I have had this rebounder for 3 weeks now and have jumped higher than I have on any other rebounder (without breaking it). It's still going strong.The rebounder is the most fun I've ever had in exercise. I only expect to get on it for 15 minutes but when I get into my music, I'll be bouncing for half an hour or more."
5,rebounder,"I love this rebounder. I had a much less expensive one that had a harder bounce. I was experiencing back & knee pain if I was on it for more than 10min. I'm on the Needak rebounder for at least 15 min each time I use it, & sometimes much longer, and have had no problem at all. It's definitely worth the investment."
1,"Damn you, Mix!",I listened to this entire cd in less than a minute. I guess not even Sir Mix A Lot isn't infallible. I don't know what's sadder; the fact this thing was released or the fact that i'll never get that fifteen bucks back.
2,Great Movie Poor Video,"Difficult topic (PETA people need not apply), but fine movie. How can you beat the combo of Warren Oats and Monte Hellman? However, the video quality is poor. Looks like a DVD-R from a second generation VHS derived from a 16mm print of the original 35mm. I guess such is the fate for those craving the obscure."
5,Great Value,"The best price I have seen, we have ordered several times and it seems they always come in a timely manner also."
3,just OK..not Great Item,"I picked these up for a Cheap altenative to bubble mailers that take up sooo much room I can have about 10,000 of these mailers in an area that I could only have 200 of bubble mailers...but the down side is I had more damaged DVD's arive with this type of package vs bubble mailers"
3,"Used Once, so far, so good","Ok, I don't have any time to tan the usual way, so I decided to buy this product. I finally used it last week and applied a very small amount on my arms and legs. I could tell that my skin color had changed but not by much since I put so little on. And there were streaks on my arm but only because I did not rub it in well. The rest of my body, however, did have an even color but did not last. I didn't really notice that the color was orange, the tan appeared normal to me. Tonight I am going to try this again and apply more this time. Hopefully it won't turn out bad, if so, I'll be back to re-write this review. Wish me luck!"
4,Typewriter Ribbon for IBM Selectric,I am well pleased with the typewriter ribbon for my Old IBM Selectric. I could not find this ribbon locally or order it through the office supply stores. It was delivered on a timely basis and fit the machine perfectly. I could not be more pleased.
3,Formatted by an ape!,"Schelling is Schelling, and this is his most important work. But the actual book looks like a bad MS Word Job. It is already a difficult text. Why make it a torturous read on top of that?"
3,Wow - is this hard to read,I have read some hard to understand books in my life but this is about the most difficult reading I have ever had to do - and members of my polisci class agree. Although the level is extremely high the ideas behind it are interesting to say the least. Pay special attention to the role of iself-conciousness it will lead to greater insight to the work.
4,"Leave My Name Out, cuz it ain't about me.","A few things to be said... LMNO, of the Blak Forest, and Visionaries crew, is not for the weak of mind, and if you've kept up with his work, you already heard the best. I personally believe that the new tracks that were added to make this album are nothing to special, but if you havent already heard his first singles, I will suggest this cd. just make sure your ready for it. peace."
3,An Athiest's Opinion,"Sorry,I had to warn everybody. Yes this album is 95% about God, but that's not why I'm only giving it 3 stars. The fact is, LMNO (like the rest of his crew except 2Mex)needs the other Vision-ares to balance him out. The whole is more than the sum of the parts. Compared to other crap out there though, its probably a 4.The CD is totally solid, with the beats by Key Kool fittin LMNO's flow the best. He's weak on a few chorus's, but that's forgiven when considering that he doen't waste rhymes spitting nonesense. Also, unlesss I'm mistaken, I don't think there is a single curse word on this disc (that is definitely comendable).As far as the religion thing goes, I respect his beliefs even if they aren't my own. The fact is he's not a sheep as proven by the line ""God owes an apology to Sodom and Gomorah/if He doesn't destroy America"". Definitely a freethinker."
2,Another mediocre hiphop album..............,"An Album like this makes me hate hiphop sometimes, cause this is another album with predictable beats and boring lyricism, I would like to say that there are a few good tracks on this album like the first two songs, and the tracks that Evidence from Dialated Peoples produced, but everything else basically is average material, too many hiphop albums are like this, to me this is just another album that goes nowhere, I took this album back to the store the same day I bought it, what does that tell you, peace."
2,better than most is no excuse,"Yea, i know that LMNO is better than most mc's out there, but this cd is almost a complete waste of my time. There is a god or jesus reference in just about every song. LMNO's lack of diverse content just gets way too boring. About 3 songs into the album, you feel like you are at sunday school. I mean that's cool if that's all you really wanna hear, but i like music about a variety of topics, and i think others like me were just as bored with this album. LMNO's lyrics just seemed way too complacent and at times his delivery even makes him sound like he's not into it. The production is pretty good and was one of the only things that got me through the entire album, but lyrically LMNO comes off boring."
5,The Best Voice in the biz,"Though this is not Clay's best overall album to date, there are a couple of songs here that just may be the best he has ever recorded. The title cut, ""A Few Questions"" and the song titled, ""I Can't Forget Her"" are worth the price of the album alone. The latter of the songs has a ""Tex-Mex"" haunting sound to it. It stands apart from any material Clay has recorded in his outstanding career.Overall, the cd is pretty solid. There are a few ""throw out"" songs that shouldn't have made the cd, but with a voice like Clay, they are tolerable to listen to.Maybe next time Clay will record some songs written by the combo of Tony Martin & Mark Nessler or Montana solo writer, Spencer Winegar (3 of country's best). Martin/Nessler & Winegar could have definitely replaced the ""throw out"" material here with some quality songs."
2,COMMENTS: ARAMIS LIFE AFTER SHAVE BALM,"THE PRODUCT WAS BETTER BEFORE, AT THIS TIME SMELLS DIFFERENT. CRYSTAL BOTTLE OFFERS DIFFICULT TO USE DIARLY THE AFTER SHAVE.IT IS NECESSARY SHAKES SEVERAL TIMES THE BOTTLE TO OBTAIN ONE DROP.I DON'T RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT ANYBODY."
1,terrible.,"The other 1-star reviews are exactly right. This is an awful production that I would not recommend to anybody. I checked it out from my local library, so fortunately I didn't waste any money, only time. Steer clear!"
1,Kultur: No culture,"I got burned by ordering the Kultur DVD on Matisse. It was sixth grade narration, sometimes related to the picture being shown, sometimes not, and pictures. I felt that I was watching my uncle's slides of his vacation to Nice. It was not at all what I expected I hoped the product would be what I'm used to seeing on PBS: a thoroughly researched, quality production. Not so with Kultur pieces. Avoid their products."
2,Oh Well...,"My father is an aircraft mechanic and afficionate of this, so I decided to give this to him as a present. I haven't watched it all, but there is one of the videos that they thry to recover an old abandon plane. It is so done the american way. poor. instead of thrying to fix re-fix and fix over what was fixed, they just simply get the rid of the old stuff and put brand new stuff. COME ON. use your ingenuity. still it did not work. my father, who knows about this. was pointing mistake over mistake.there is another reason why this is so American. They only show American planes. Be a little more open minded. the world is larger. also the Amrican aircraft moddles came from copied or stolen designs of other countries inventions, or design in America by foreigners.still is something that will let you burn time. but definitely ita can be better."
5,Great Independent Flick,"Nicely told story of the same ten minutes as seen from several different points of view. Good twist toward the end. I don't watch many independent movies, but I'm glad I saw this one. It's one to keep for your collection--definitely worth watching again and again.(btw...it does have sex and violence, so I wouldn't recommend it for persons under 17)."
5,Sensational Noir Thriller!,"Saw this one during it's brief theatrical run and was BLOWN AWAY! TEN 'TIL NOON is a highly original modern film noir with a terrific structural gimmick - the entire film takes place in a ten minute time span, between 11:50 and noon. Each time the clock strikes noon, the film rewinds and places us in the point of view of a different character. What we end up with is an incredibly layered web, with each new segment completely turning the story on it's head. The result is invigorating. I've never seen anything quite like it.TEN 'TIL NOON also has the requisite thriller elements, all in fine form - the femme fatales, the hitmen, the double-crosses, sex and violence galore. But the unique story structure puts it over the edge into great filmmaking. This is a fantastic, highly original indie film that demonstrates there are still new ways to tell a story.So glad this is FINALLY coming to DVD!!! It bears many, many viewings."
5,Sexy scenes and lots of surprises!,"I give this movie five stars for two reasons:1. It's an intelligent movie where nothing is predictable. Even one of the climatic execution scenes took me by surprise.2. It has lots of really good sexy scenes. Some of the sex scenes were steamy hot, and some of them were funny.But most of all, the DVD is filled with a lot of extra stuff. You could see that the people behind this film went that extra step every step of the way. I can't wait to see what they come up with next."
1,Terrible writing.,"Reviews in various places mention poor acting, but I disliked the writing even more. The ignorance and lack of creativity demonstrated in the movie's title should have kept me away, unnecessarily abbreviating the word until (like the fast food marketing idiots of MacDonald's and Taco Bell) rather than using the word till. A waste of time for an unsatisfying conclusion, this movie isn't even worth renting."
5,Beautiful background!,The background in this workout is relaxing enough to make you forget you are working out. I highly recommend it!
1,Outragious shipping charge,The shipping charge on 5 of these was almost $10.00. This is way out of proportion to other items of similar size and weight.
2,"Be wary of this ""box set""!","This collection has one CD each for Clapton, Beck and Page. The Clapton one has the songs he did with Page which is great to hear, but the Beck songs are mostly Yardbirds tracks and instrumentals-I'm not sure where those songs came from. The Jimmy Page disc is basically worthless-some second rate R & B singer with a studio band that apparently Page is playing with. But you sure can't tell who is playing guitar. Some of the tracks are repeated on the different discs so there is no telling who is really is on the track! And, of course, there is absolutely zero information about the tracks listed!"
1,the total pack,"It is wery old numbers and the sound is bad. It is not fair against custumers to say, that the pack is from 1999.I am wery disapointed.Regards Anders"
4,I LIKE!,"I like this magazine, I have a subscription. It's pretty good especially bout what all the famous people are up to. With embaressing moments as well as truth or dare, the only thing it's missing is more personal stories"
4,J-14,"its a great magazine and i reccomend it to any one. it has everything you ever need to know on music, movies, hairstyles, makeup, etc. it has posters in every issue, but most of them are only brittany spears and NSYNC....i was hoping for more eminem and maybe even some new bands (simple plan, Grand skeem, hatebreed etc.) its mostly all about pop stars...not rap, punk, heavy metal or any of that...but i still reccomend it to any one"
2,Only One Focus,"I used to get this magazine awhile ago, but I got tired of reading about celebrities. There isn't really any real life issues, or even many other topics. Unless you love to read about celebrities' lives, I don't recommend this magazine."
3,J-14 is an okay magazine,"If you're into celebs, you'll like this mag but if your not, it will make you [ill]. It has good posters, some of the articles are interesting, but for the most part its gossip on celebs. Mostly i just use mine for posters, but the quizes are fun too. Its also good for little kids and older kids because there not much inappropriate stuff. Sometimes its like, ""Why tweet almost killed herself"" or "" is Alicia Keys gay"" but other than that its okay. On some of the stuff I'm like,...im agaisnt pop music but if you like r&b, hip-hop, and rap they have some good stuff too. Overall its an okay mag, but if its my [money] then i'd rather go out and buy a tee-shirt."
5,J14 review,This magazine is great because it doesn't have a lot of advertisements. Teen magazine and other magazines like that have way too many. J14 give you all the gossip. Teens should definately buy it! It wins over any magazine.
2,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS PURCHASE AS OF YET,I REALLY DONT REALIZE WHY I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM YET ITS GOING ON 6 WEEKS AND HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHARGED.SO IM UNABLE TO RATE THIS PRODUCT.
1,Celebrity's Aren't Everything People!,I used to read this magazine a long time ago when I was like 13. I have since then grown out of this magazine. I personally am sick of magazines like this that have celebrity gosssip. This magazine is almsost as bad as US Weekly. Get Seventeen magazine instead.P.S-I'm not a kid- I don't have a login
1,Awful,"I got a subscription to this magazine, but they only sent me a copy every other month! I ended up getting only 6 issues when I paid for 12! I am sure of this because I saved every issue I got just to make sure. Also, in the September issue, on page 14, you can clearly see that MaryKate's lower back isn't real. It was edited. This magazine doesn't focus on anything interesting and it isn't good for older teens. I would never recommend this magazine to anyone!"
5,its the best,i get almot every mounths issue i love it i suggest you to get it for you teen or youself (if you a kid). well what-ever just get it it has all kinds of star news *(no interpropet thing or stuff like that) it totaly cool !!
3,fair...,"i really like the magazine and all... it has great issues and stories. STORIES. i think some of the articles are made up though. especially pages dealing with celebs. some of its ard to believe. i know those pages are suppost to be hard to believe, but some is just over the limit. otherwise, if you enjoy being entertained this way go for it. :)"
3,j14 kindle fire,i think j14 should be for kindle fire because i like reading on my kindle and i wish amazon would let j14 be on kindle fire thanks ~briana
4,Perfect for young teens,"My granddaughter, age 13, is crazy about a lot of celebrities. This was the perfect gift for her, and I have just renewed the subscription for two more years. The second she knows it has arrived, she is off to her bedroom to devour the whole issue. She then goes back and reads it again. (I am glad it only comes once a month, or I would lose her to her room)"
3,Too Gross For Li(c)king,"It's great that you guys can write all of that stuff, but some of the pictures are a little bit PG-13 rated (and some rated R)so try to keep it down on the articles like:Briney is Making Love in Bed, and Jessica had a sexy boyfriend that made a BIG move too early- Wanna see Jess' Wild Night?I mean, GIVE it A REST!you don't need to post this one, just read it please!"
1,Subscription never arrived,"I ordered this magazine for my granddaughter last summer. No issues ever arrived. I learned this many months later when I asked my granddaughter how she liked it. When I called the magazine, I was told they would sent one or two replacements. They never arrived either. I would not order from them again."
2,Magazine Subscribtion,About a month ago we order a subscription for J-14 magazine for my child. We have not received the magazine. I am starting to think we will never receive the magazine.
2,Hey AMAZON....not getting the subscription...,"What's up with all the people ordering this on here and not receiving their magazine, Amazon?? This is a fun, ""Tiger Beat"" type of magazine...but it is much better if you actually GET the magazine."
2,Used to Like It...,"When I was around 12, I used to like this magazine. Hidden underneath all the teenage, wannabe-tabloid fluff were actually some interesting articles and fairly interesting celebrity gossip. Plus, I really liked the glossy posters.But now, J-14 has taken a turn for the worse. The articles have gotten really dull, most of them revolving around the likes and dislikes of celebrities. Do any of us honestly care about where (insert Disney Channel star's name) or (insert teenybopper's name) shop or who they have a crush on or what's their absolutely fave lip gloss?The answer is: NO.And I hate how they show the same celebrities over and over again now. In every issue, there's Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, a Jonas, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, etc. And when they do show someone new, it's just some teenybopper who starred in some movie I never watched and never will see.If you really like this kind of stuff, I recommend reading magazines for adults like People."
4,It was good.....but not great......,"It was good but not great some of the rumors, facts, and stuff about stars was pretty obvious but if you don't know zilch about stars and would like to this magazine is LOADED with everything you want to know about stars! I recommend this magazine for ages 10-14!"
1,"We're still waiting, too...","We waited for months on end for the first issue to arrive. It finally did, but we have never received another one. My daughter is broken-hearted and told me today, ""I told you we should have just subscribed through the magazine, but nooooooo, we had to find a bargain."" I will not purchase a subscription through this service again. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have."
3,A preteen read.,"I do believe that J-14 is not for just any aged teen like it publicizes. I think the interest of the reader stops at the age of at least 15 (and that's pushing it!). After turning about 15, J-14 becomes to be a bit too juvenile. I would recommend this magazine to girls between the ages of 11-15."
1,4 months & no magazine,I ordered this magazine in Aug & it's almost the end of December & I still haven't received my first issue yet. It's been a month that I've contacted customer service and I'm still waiting for my first issue.I'm editing my review. It's now 5 months & STILL NO MAGAZINE! They keep telling me to wait & I will receive my first issue soon. They told me this 3 times already.I DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING THROUGH HERE. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG!
5,Good for teen age daughter,My daughter loves the magazine and actually spends more time reading than normal. Something is better than nothing.
3,subsricption service takes TOO long!,Magazine was a gift to grand daughter and purchased in October. Took till end of year to finally get first copy. No one else takes that long with a subscription. The service was very discouraging.
1,AWFULLLLLLLLLL!!!!,"received 3 issues, then it stopped, and we have been getting renewal requests since then. Do not purchase this ever!!!"
5,Keeping up with young hollywood,Granddaughter loves it! Allows her to keep up with young hollywood. Seems to be a magazine with tasteful news on young stars. Good kid's magazine.
2,blah,it was okay if u love pop music.but definately dont come here if u in here for the posters unless u want britney spears.They do though have good gossip and embaressing momments lots of stuff to read but its not my fav magazine
1,Just plain silly,"J-14 is cheap and not well written. In my opinion, it focuses too much on celebrities and not enough on things teens ages 11-15 really care about (intellectual ones at least). Unless you really want to know what Britney Spears eats for breakfast every Thursday, skip it and go for Seventeen or Girls Life."
2,"Twist, M, J-14- what's the difference?","The title speaks for itself.I don't know how or why I was drawn to this magazine when I was 14. This magazine should be called J-4tweens. Ah. The title is very annoying. Like Twist, I only get this magazine when I'm really really desperate for something to read. I sure as hell wouldn't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara. If you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress, get this. The only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things (but of course). Other than that, no. They feature pretty bland fashion.All in all, this magazine is JUST like Twist.Therefore, the age reccomendation is just 11 & 12, but you're better off getting GL for even more years worth of goodness (10-15 yrs.) because no, it's NOT cool to steal your sister's damn boyfriend for pete's sake."
1,"Ho, ho...","Just one more one-star review to throw at this disposable, superficial, cliche, empty-headed ""mAgGaZeEn"". Wow, Lindsay Lohan's favorite lip gloss! STOP THE PRESSES! Worthless.Grow up. Life, as a concept, is something more than ""AaRoN cArTeR's DrEeM wOmUnN!"". Yes, even in 2005."
3,Gossip.,"Basically all this magazine is gossip and celebrities. Now if you like celebrities, thats great. Get this magazine but it is a little ... blah. Its not a very good magazine - suscribe it for a year and that will be enough celebrity gossip that it will be coming out of your ears.Overall: Try it for a bit. I bought about 5 of them and they were good but then I realized I don't care about what type of hair product this celebrity is using ..."
2,I'm 14 and I REFUSE to be like that,"I like the posters...but everything eles is pointless. This mag. should be names J-10 or something, because I CANNOT see any of my friends actually picking up this garbage. There is way too much fluff that I personally don't give a dang about. And poor Eminem...he looks constipated on the cover! lol If you want a real music mag., I reccommend Blender or Rolling Stone. For a true teen mag., get Teen People or Cosmo Girl...or YM is you like extra fluff."
3,Good if U R going Goth clubbing and new 2 the scene,"If you are planning on going Goth clubbing and need some moves, get this DVD. If you are looking for bellydance instruction, I'd recommend starting with the move breakdown in Luscious. Tempest covers some ideas in her expression session that are valuable, but short. I was a little disappointed in the performance section because I felt the performance was more Burlesque bellydance than Gothic bellydance. I thought she would perform more of what she taught (Skinny Puppy or something?)"
3,cheesy,"I do hang out in goth clubs and I do dance goth. I recently started belly dancing so I was really excited about this dvd. It was mediocrity at its best. This dvd is so low budget. The workout is boring. The performance was good but as far as watching this or working out to this dvd, I just can't. The Tribal East coast is much much better, along with Rachel Brice isolations. Sorry Tempestt."
2,Meh,"I bought this DVD at a festival a few years ago when I first started taking classes. I might have liked it more if I didn't already have Ariellah's. The dance instruction is pretty basic and unexceptional. The performances are boring, although I do like the music.Not saying Tempest is a bad dancer or teacher in real life, but I outgrew this disc before I even got it. Might be useful for a teen who loves Hot Topic."
4,Easy to understand and fun to watch,"I like Tempest and I want to meet her someday. I like how this video is presented, she first shows you how to incorporate bellydance moves onto your standatd goth club dance floor, but you can also use this part to make your bellydance more goth. She explains things in a clear and easy to understand manner, and her outfits are amazing!I did have one bit about the Expression Workshop, she is a little too ""candid"" in a couple places, and tends to overexplain. (""porn face""). But I suppose the target audience for this video is of the more open-minded set (not many prissy grandmas and soccer moms) so it's not a huge deal. It's a good thing to include though, and Tempest makes a good point that Goth BD is NOT the same as Cabaret or Tribal; IMO, it's as different from each of those as they are from each other.And of course, her performances at the end are great to watch!"
4,Things To Come - 'I Want Out' (Sundazed),"Eighteen track compilation of this obscure psych / garage rock band's repertoire, recorded in 1967. Cuts that make this CD worth seeking out are ""Mississippi Dealer"", title track ""I Want Out"", the foot-stomping ""Your Down"", the ass-kicking ""Tell Me Why"", their Seeds cover - an intstrumental of ""Pushin' Too Hard"", ""Show Me A Place"" and the upbeat ""Icicles On The Roof"". Couldn't help but to notice a heavy Stones influence here. Line-up: Steve Runolfsson - keyboards, harmonica & vocals, Lynn Rominger - guitar, Bryan Garofalo - bass and Russ Kunkel - drums. Should appeal to old school fans of the Outcasts, Cynics, Barry & The Remains and Shadows Of Knight."
4,Not Famous Name Still Good,The tendency to downgrade non famous maker compilations as near worthless is very common. I challenge those who mainly read the name on the title to put down their desperate desire to share their devotion to narcissism and prove they can really tell where the famous conductor made a real qualitative instead of merely stylistic difference.Top notch recording techniques are readily available everywhere and thisforty CD set proves it. If you want to enjoy and study Beethoven's worksit is perfectly adequate. If you have a interest in studying some well known maestro's particlar take on things then go elsewhere.
2,Beethoven Premium Edition,"Beethoven Premium EditionThis collection has two merits: 1. It is really cheap (US$ 0.83 each CD)and 2. it is quickly forgettable. Buy it if you want to have your first Beethoven bath. Suggestion to the editors: change the name of the collection, its name should more accurately be: Unknown Beethoven classical premium edition (it is just Beethoven against 19 almost unknown interpreters and directors)"
4,A wonderful sadly undiscovered work of Jack Bruce,"Yes - so here we have Jack doing many different things - and most of them incredibly well. It's great to hear him take some chances again and not worry about the commercial appeal of the music. My personal favorite is Close Enough For Love - which is a clever little ditty complete with a nifty lounge piano segment and the shout-out - the drummer is an Indian - referring to Trilok Gurtu. In all songs Jack's vocals are superlative. In fact, his singing is reason enough to get the album. These are full, warm. loose vocals - a mjor improvement over some of the stuff found on Monkjack where he seems to try just a little too hard and gets shrill and thin. Clapton's playing on - what is it - 3, I guess, songs is tasteful and to the point, and I believe that anyone who likes Songs for a Tailor should find much here to savor."
5,WOW,This is a great cd ---wait a minute it is still on backorder i ordered it in november and still no cd just like that toys-r-us commercial butnot even a rain check as a present ... that was a gift that never came
5,Great Tool,The space I have on the car to get a tool into is very limited. This tool is the perfect size and very easy to use. Highly recommend it.
3,"Mario, the quickest death ever!!!!","I liked this DVD, the production is a little bit controversial, but the director achieved to show the intimate drama in a huge stage. The second act is perfect. The first is surprisingly good after Scarpia entrance and the sets are riveting. The problem here is the third act, Tosca has killed the evil baron for Mario's sake. With bloody hands and loving promises she arrived, after a beautiful ""lucevan le stelle' to warn Mario about the fake execution. They never really met in this production, she sings over him in a kind of balcony. At the moment of the execution itself, the TV director CUT OFF all the Tosca's lines and screams!!!! Why??? It's only a few moments of music although very significant ones! Nadja Michael is perfectly capable to delivery it! What hapenned? I'm shure for the live audience the scene was there! Why not in video, handicapping a strong performance? Shame, shame, shame!"
1,Worst Tosca Ever!,It's not just the bizarre staging and the hideous costumes and the fact that we are constantly prevented from being even remotely involved by the camera jumping into four black and white scenes from time to time. But it is poorly sung and conducted. The worst Tosca and Caravadosi and Scarpia on CD or DVD. I never made through Act One. Thank the operatic gods I just rented and didn't buy this turkey.
5,i love the 70's,Man I love the Doooooooooobies! And to have all their hits on one album is so great. Have a good time listening to this great band. Its like going back in time to the 70's ! Hold on and enjoy the ride !
3,Single song versions are a sham!!!,"I'm not totally against the song selections for this CD (except for the omission(s) of ""Sweet Maxine"", ""Another Park, Another Sunday"" and ""Disciple""). My real objection concerns the shortened versions of some of the best American rock music ever recorded. True Doobie fans like myself don't appreciate single versions of any of their songs and this supposed best of set has 5 of them!!! ""Listen To The Music"", ""Jesus Is Just Alright"", ""Nobody"", ""It Keeps You Runnin'"" and ""Dependin' On You"" deserve to be heard in their entirety not some watered down version designed to get more songs on the CD. In this case more songs are definitely not better!!"
3,Just get the individual albums,"How can you chose the best songs? This band is one of the best, and this album doesn't do them justice. Some of my favorites are omitted. If you used to like them and are thinking about getting this album, check out the samples of the original albums. Especially Toulouse Street. I own every one of their releases now, and the only one I find weak is Stampede, although I need to give it a few more listens. I also like their later stuff, and Wheels of Fortune is my favorite song."
5,A True Greatest Hits Collection All In One Disc And Worth Every Penny,"The Doobie Brothers is just one of those rock groups that shape up the classic rock era of the 70s and modernized the pop era in the 80s & 90s. This 20 track CD is a perfect example of this blend of artists' top billboard hits that takes you to a journey of those good, refreshing and easy listening days. If you're a big fan, the Michael MacDonald Ultimate Collection CD is highly recommended. Here, in his solo career in the 90s & 2000s, Michael emphasizes his soulful sense of style that is so relaxing and captivating to easy listeners like me. Check it out."
4,Grat CD but...,This is a great CD but it should have left Dangerous & Echoes of Love and included Another Park Another Sunday & South City Midnight Lady.
4,"Solid, comprehensive ""best of""","Purists may tell you to avoid the ""Best Of"" type of disc because of the real chance you'll miss a gem. They're not wrong about that, but when there are only so many hours in the day, and so many dollars in the wallet, the Best Of is an excellent way to experience the highlight's of an act's career. And this is one of the better examples, with work from both ""eras"" of the Doobie Brothers, almost everyone's radio favorite is here. Easily more than half of the songs will be ones you've heard if you grew up in the 70s or listen to the music regularly. Well worth the purchase."
4,Beautiful book,The Grandpa Tree is a small book with a big message. It's perfect to read to children who do not understand living and dying totally.
4,This Game Is Cool,"I am 8 years old and I like space games. I like Galaga's graphics, music and level of difficulty. The plot is interesting. It's a little hard to play with the keyboard so I suggest having a joystick. I recommend this game."
3,Not The Arcade Version,I purchased this game used at a very cheap price thinking I was getting the original arcade version. I was disapointed when I played it as it is not that game.
2,Poor quality video,"The video for ""What's On Your Mind"" looks like it was a bad transfer, there's what looks like video tape damage near the center of the screen, it's there during most of the video. It almost looks like it was a vhs copy. Also, it looks like the video was deinterlaced, which is something that should never be done to something sold on dvd. The video skips every few seconds because half of the frames are missing. The rest of the videos look ok, although the video for ""Think"" also skips sometimes."
2,Eric Clapton - Live in Hyde Park,"I bought this title expecting a great recording. Unforunately, the recording was VERY dissapointing, visuals are not clear as they should be and the audio was very flat with poor discrete 5.1 channel seperation. I bought this title to enjoy on my high end system and was very dissapointed. It goes without saying the Eric Claptons music and performance is not the issue..."
5,One of the best DVD's I own,"This is definitely the best solo Clapton DVD available. The best one for my money would be the Cream Live At the Royal Albert Hall Reunion Concert. The Live At Hyde Park DVD has amazing performances from Clapton and the band. Clapton is one of my favorite guitarists and his guitar work here is fantastic. The concert was filmed extremely well with plenty closeups of Eric playing the guitar. His guitar work throughout the concert is extraordinary. Having a live performance of ""I Shot The Sheriff"" with a guitar solo from EC is awesome and other highlights include ""Five Long Years,"" ""Badge,"" ""White Room,"" ""Have You Ever Loved A Woman,"" ""I'm Tore Down,"" ""Old Love,"" and ""It Hurts Me Too."" Eric and the band give incredible performances for every song, and EC's guitar playing is unbelieveable. I highly recommend this DVD to any Clapton fans or to anyone who is a fan of guitar music. This DVD and the Cream DVD mentioned above are the ultimate Clapton DVDs."
5,Great Clapton DVD,"Clapton is still at his peak. Playing as good and even better than he did back in the 60's and 70's.I bought this DVD, Clapton's Guitar Festival DVD and the Cream 2005 Reunion DVD all within the last couple months. All of them are just great, but I'd give the Cream Reunion DVD a solid 5 in all categories...to me its even better than this DVD.However back to Clapton's Live in Hyde Park, the footage is great, the sound is great, the band is solid, and Eric really plays with fire on most tracks. He's definetely one of the most reserved/modest guitar players, but truly shines above all others when it comes down to who has the real substance to stand above his peers."
5,just amazing,"FROM THE ACOUSTIC OPENING OF ""LAYLA"" THE THE ENCORE OF ""HOLY MOTHER"" WITH A FULL CHOIR EC PLAYS WITH PASSION ON EVERY NOTE. THE OTHER GREAT CUTS ARE "" IM TORE DOWN"" AND ""HAVE YOU EVER LOVED A WOMAN"""
3,Great music- Mediocre Dvd,"I put this on my Santa List after reading these reviews, and have to say I am sorely disappointed. I find it very hard to understand why so many 5stars on this one. The music is great, and wished I had just got the CD instead. The DVD, the visual part, is not very provocative. The outdoor concert is fine, but the lighting not so good. Clapton plays great, but not much in the way of enthusiasm. Much of the time he looks like he's overly concentrating on what he's doing (which he is doing wonderfully) or someone in the band is in the wrong key, or something just isn't working right - he often looks a bit annoyed. The camera angle cuts, like so many of these DVD concerts are so fricking fast you have no time to consume them. Like I say, it's a great concert, for the music, just not the visual quality I want in a DVD production."
1,Dont buy THIS disc....,"Ok, first, this rating and do not buy advice is based on the disc itself and not the content or the seller.The seller shipped FAST.Clapton is outstanding.BUT THE AUDIO ISNT SYNCHED TO THE VIDEO !!!!!!!!! LOL... Some of you may not care. I really don't care enough to send it back. But when you watch the drummer you can clearly see he is late to the audio. I shoot and edit video on a semi professional basis and I could see it right at the start.So I can only guess this DVD has been stamped out so many times that it is being shipped that way from the main supplier. Whoever that is.Also, it is not widescreen. And when you select the ""Biography"" from the main menu, you get computer code where the English writing should be. LOL. Do I care? Not really. Not enough to send it back.The beauty in this DVD is Clapton. good lord... he is the epitome of smoooooooth....Maybe you can find this from some other manufacturer, maybe only mine is bad. I don't know. It is what it is."
3,dissapointing performance,"I've been a fan of Clapton since the Bluesbreaker's album and I''m not a hater, but I removed this dvd from my netflix queu and purchased it after reading the reviews on Amazon. (I needed another item to get my order of a recent book eligible for free shipping) I have all of the crossroads dvds, the cream reunion and the Eric Clapton and friends dvd (the best of the lot, maybe tied with the Cream reunion) and I have to state that I find his playing a bit lacking in this concert. It's a great band, there's a lot of good music, but Eric's solos are spotty. His attack is not nearly as strong as we're used to seeing and he frustrates me a bit with some drawn out repetitive phrases, especially at the begining of three of the solos. It's not terrible and you won't get this set list anywhere else, but Eric's performance is not up to his normal creativity, fluidity and brashness."
